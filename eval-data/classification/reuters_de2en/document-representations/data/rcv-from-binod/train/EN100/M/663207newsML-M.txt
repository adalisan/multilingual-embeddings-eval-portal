the yield on Kazakh three-month Treasury bills is likely to be unchanged or rise slightly at Tuesday &apos;s auction , because its current level of some 10 percent annual is too low for Kazakh banks and foreigners , dealers said . 
the yield on three-month paper firmed to 10.64 percent annual last Tuesday from 10.30 percent at the previous auction on June 3 . 
Pogulyayeva said T-bills with some three months maturity outstanding are being offered on the secondary market at 12-13 percent , which means their price is lower than that of three-month paper placed on the primary market . 
&quot; There is real interest in the secondary market ... and if you apply this interest to the primary one , you feel that these expectations of an upward yield trend are grounded , &quot; she said . 
Zhilstroibank dealer Asan Buranbayev concurred with Pogulyayeva &apos;s point but said auctions of National Bank notes later this week were another factor which could steady or slightly raise T-bill yields . 
&quot; The current yield is ludicrous for banks and cannot fall further , the more so as the National Bank will hold two note auctions , so there is ( a financial instrument ) to invest money in , &quot; he said . 
notes are issued regularly to sterilise the money supply and support the rate of the national tenge currency . 
Azat Iskulov of Global Kazkommerts Securities said that yields of less than 10 percent annual would not satisfy foreign investors either . 
taking into account payments to Kazakh dealers and for currency transfers , real yields on MKM bills are already close to around eight percent annual currently paid on Kazakh Eurobonds issued last December , he said . 
Kazakh officials have admitted that steeply falling yields on government paper have led to a flight of foreign capital to T-bill markets of other former Soviet republics . 
the Central Asian state &apos;s government is planning to hold the first auctions of its new two- and three-year T-bills this month , hoping to revive the interest of foreigners and local banks in the domestic debt market . 
other dealers gave largely psychological reasons for the expected rise or stability of yields . 
&quot; Strong nerves of local dealers will stand behind this ... 
many banks are still buying T-bills -- mostly because they are inert and have not fled to securities markets of other states yet , &quot; said Nurlan Mukhametzhanov of Bank TuranAlem . 
he said his bank -- among Kazakhstan &apos;s largest -- was among those important &quot; inert buyers &quot; . 
&quot; Our bank is still buying Kazakh T-bills to support its liquidity , because to keep money on an account at the National Bank is less profitable , &quot; he said .
