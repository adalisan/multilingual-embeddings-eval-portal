the same powerful spread tightening for the more speculative-grade bond issues that has beefed-up returns over the past year is now turning some money managers away from those credits , buy-side sources said . 
Fund managers said single-B credits yielding as rich or richer than 350 basis points above the Treasury curve have been deemed anywhere from 100 to 200 basis points too tight , depending on the manager . 
but therein lies consistency -- the reward for the risk has ceased to entice , and money managers have been turning to lower yielding and safer credits . 
&quot; We &apos;re trying to move up in quality , &quot; said John Bianchi , managing director of Smith Barney Inc &apos;s high-yield funds . 
&quot; We &apos;ll give up yield to do that but we feel the spread risk of better quality paper is less because of the broader investor universe that you have buying it . 
along with meager spreads , Bianchi also noted the potential for a sustained market correction is another strike against single-B paper , especially in the new issue market . 
weak &quot; single-Bs &quot; are coming to market as tight as 350 basis points off treasuries , he said , and that &apos;s too tight for a bond that &apos;s &quot; likely to disappoint . 
high-yield &quot; cushion &quot; bonds , are popular with Bianchi . 
some of those , like Hughes electronics Corp owned PanAmSat Corp debt , trade well under 100 basis points over treasuries , but their purchase at a 12 percent yield assures a reliable and respectable return , he said . 
&quot; What I give up is the potential to make more money with some new issue , but if the new issue is coming at 300 off the curve , with a potential back-up in treasuries , with an equity market correction looming , I &apos;m better off staying where I am , &quot; Bianchi said . 
other managers concurred , calling the trend away from single-B credits a pure valuation move in light of fantastic spread compression in that sector . 
since December of 1995 , single-Bs have rallied in the area of 125 basis points , managers said , compared with about 75 basis points of tightening for double-Bs . 
&quot; You are not being adequately compensated to take single-B risk , particularly weak single-B risk , said Lars Berkman , manager of the prudential High Yield Fund Inc . 
there &apos;s more demand than supply and that situation will not last forever , &quot; Berkman said , adding that even if the economy doesn &apos;t weaken , supply will catch up and spreads will return to more historically relative levels . 
mark Durbiano , a high-yield fund manager with Federated Investors , said his selling is focused more on smaller companies that have rallied over the past year . 
broadly speaking , that means a move from small B-minus or B3 names to high-quality credits , he said . 
&quot; The protypical thing to sell is a mid-tier credit , probably a small company with small absolute dollars of cash flow , Durbiano said . 
&quot; Then I buy a Viacom , for instance , which trades 180 basis points over treasuries , it has $ 13 billion of equity market capitalization and hundreds of million in free cash flow . 
Durbiano said his selling does not dip down into paper with yields at or near 15 percent .
