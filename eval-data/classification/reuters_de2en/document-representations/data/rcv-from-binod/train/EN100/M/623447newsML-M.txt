the key June 10-year Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures contract is likely to try for the upside on Friday after strong gains on Thursday afternoon . 
but traders said the June &apos;s rise may stop below 124.00 due to lingering concerns over higher Japanese interest rates . 
&quot; The June is unlikely to jump above 124.00 unless banks change their interest rate outlook and start receiving fixed interest rates in the interest rate swap ( IRS ) market , &quot; said a dealer at a trust bank &apos;s securities unit . 
given Thursday &apos;s weaker-than-expected April industrial output data , the downside room is seen limited , traders said .
