an International Monetary Fund team now in Buenos Aires is only preparing the way for a mission around the middle of the year to negotiate a new agreement , a top Argentine official said . 
&quot; This IMF mission will be here for 10 days and did not come to discuss the small print of the agreement , but just to establish a list of issues to be considered in the main accord , &quot; Economy Minister chief advisor Carlos Rodriguez told reporters late Monday . 
&quot; Our intention is to reach a three-year ( Extended-Fund Facility ) agreement , but if that is not possible we will have another one-year ( stand-by ) agreement . 
it is also possible that we have another ( Extended-Fund Facility ) without necessarily having to receive disbursements , &quot; Rodriguez said . 
&quot; We want to continue with structural reform and we want IMF auditing because we consider it best , as it forces you to define the situation over the next three years , &quot; he said . 
a three-year agreement starting from 1998 to 2000 would provide an economic policy framework bridging presidential elections in 1999 . 
issues discussed with the IMF team included changing the tax system to reduce payroll tax and other levies on employment . 
&quot; Taxes on work are a heavy burden on the poorest people , as what with this and value-added tax , the poorest end up paying proportionately more than the middle classes , &quot; Rodriguez said . 
but he added the new agreement will probably not come before the present accord with the IMF expires in December . 
&quot; Having them back to back was a good idea , but we are not going to make it on time , &quot; he said . 
IMF head Michel Camdessus , who is due to visit Buenos Aires for a bankers &apos; meeting May 19 , will not participate in any negotiations , Rodriguez said .
