the head of the immigration service promised on Wednesday to improve a system of fingerprinting applicants for citizenship that a member of Congress said could be &quot; a scandal waiting to happen . 
Doris Meissner , commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalisation Service , told a congressional hearing that new quality procedures in the ins required a &quot; long hard look &quot; at a system under which INS-certified businesses and organisations were able to take fingerprints . 
&quot; We are well aware of its limitations and are aggressively pursuing short and long-term options to strengthen the reliability of the fingerprint process , &quot; Meissner said . 
Meissner was testifying to a House Judiciary subcommittee after an independent review found only one of 23 ins offices was fully complying with reforms on checking citizenship applications . 
Meissner said the review was &quot; a valuable early warning . 
Members of Congress have criticised the ins , saying it granted citizenship last year to thousands of unqualified aliens , including some with criminal records , because of poor background checks . 
asked by subcommittee chairman Lamar Smith , a Texas Republican , if she could give assurance that the ins was not allowing criminals to become U.S. citizens , Meissner said : &quot; I believe we can assure you and the American people today that we are not naturalising criminals . 
Smith said a printout of approved and pending applications by private firms to participate in the so-called designated fingerprint services showed applications by a liquor store , a photo shop , an advocacy organisation , a hairstylist and a bridal shop . 
&quot; As for the hundreds of storefront businesses , it is doubtful whether the ins will be able to monitor them all , &quot; Smith said . 
&quot; This may well be another scandal waiting to happen . 
Meissner said high Justice Department official Robert Bratt , who began work Monday in the new post of head of ins naturalisation operations , and former General Accounting Office chief Charles Bowsher , a part time adviser , would give priority to training ins field personnel in quality assurance procedures . 
&quot; This basic need has not been properly addressed , &quot; she said .
