Burundi &apos;s prime minister said on Thursday that France recognised his country &apos;s leaders , who seized power in a July coup , as the central African state &apos;s &quot; de facto government &quot; . 
&quot; The Burundian government is there , it is the de facto government ... we think that the French government has recognised it and this is a good thing for peace in the world , &quot; Pascal Firmin Ndimira told a news conference during a visit to Paris . 
Ndimira said his visit was intended to explain to Paris the transitional government &apos;s strategy for national reconciliation . 
France had shunned an earlier Burundian official visit . 
he said he had made progress in relations , citing talks with French Cooperation Minister Jacques Godfrain and aides to President Jacques Chirac on Wednesday and Thursday . 
the French Foreign Ministry declined comment on Ndimira &apos;s remarks , saying its ties with Burundi were unchanged since French policy was to recognise only states and not governments . 
but France &apos;s decision to allow officials to meet Ndimira was in itself a breakthrough . 
when Burundian Foreign Minister Luc Rukingama came to Paris in August , the French Foreign Ministry dubbed it a private visit and ruled out official talks . 
following the coup , Burundi &apos;s neighbours imposed an economic embargo on the African state and the European Parliament urged European Union member states to refuse to recognise Major Pierre Buyoya &apos;s new regime . 
in a non-binding resolution approved in September , the European Parliament urged an extension of the ban on weapons and ammunition to put further pressure on the Burundi leadership to restore democracy . 
Ndimira said his government had set in place a transitional &quot; document &quot; intended to guide the country &apos;s return to democracy and was making progress in healing national divisions . 
he said the government also welcomed the recent return of 30,000 Burundian refugees from eastern Zaire and denied charges of mistreatment levelled by the human rights group Amnesty International . 
&quot; The Burundi government is doing all it can to assist them , and has done its best to make them feel welcome upon their return , &quot; Ndimira told reporters . 
Amnesty International , in a report released in London on Thursday , said the returning refugees were &quot; being forced back to Burundi to face the same terrible human rights abuses that caused them to flee in the first place &quot; . 
&quot; No refugees should be forcibly returned to a country which has seen as many as 500 returnees reportedly killed by the Burundi security forces in recent weeks , &quot; the group said , stating it had documented cases of killings , disappearances and ill-treatment occurring almost daily throughout the country . 
Burundian Hutu refugees fled Burundi two years ago to escape the violence following the massacre of up to a million Tutsis in neighbouring Rwanda . 
Ndimira said Burundi &apos;s refugee problem was far smaller than in Rwanda , which has been flooded by the return of hundreds of thousands of its people fleeing eastern Zaire to avoid fighting between Zairean forces and Tutsi rebels . 
he estimated that Burundi had no more than 120,000 refugees remaining in eastern Zaire and urged them to all return home .
