world coffee prices have pulled back sharply since rocketing to their highest level in 20 years last month , but the recent setback may be only temporary , said Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes . 
&quot; Potential for a strong comeback still exists , especially against the September delivery , &quot; Ganes said in a bi-monthly update on the coffee market . 
&quot; While coffee prices recently collapsed , threats of renewed tightness should not be taken lightly . 
while aggressive shipments from producers have slowly replenished consumer stockpiles in the U.S. , supplies of good-quality coffees deliverable to the exchange will remain scarce , the report said . 
&quot; In the months ahead there is likely to be very little coffee available that will be able to meet exchange specifications , &quot; it said . 
&quot; deliverable supplies should remain exceptionally tight through the September expiration and in advance of the peak consumption period . 
although more coffee has made its way into the pipeline recently , Ganes doubts the stock build will be enough to sufficiently supply roasters until many new-crop beans become available in the autumn . 
variables , such as bean substitution , consumer resistance to higher retail prices and the amount of coffee remaining at origin , will affect availablilty in the coming months , the report said . 
in the case of producer inventory , Ganes noted that second-largest grower Colombia has already used 1.4 million bags of its previous crop coffee . 
according to the Colombian Coffee Federation , another 1.0 million-bag stockpile reduction may be necessary based on a crop estimate of 10 million bags and internal consumption of 1.5 million bags . 
if 1996 / 97 Colombian production falls short of 10 million bags , as monthly production data to date indictates , it will further diminish its reserves , the report said . 
&quot; At best case scenario , production might be 9.7 million bags , forcing Colombia to eat into stocks , of which the remainder is questionable and might not be of high enough standards to even ship , &quot; the report said . 
Merrill Lynch said 1996 / 97 world coffee exports of an estimated 79 million bags would lead to a total producer stock drawdown of 5.7 million bags to 26 million bags . 
producer inventories could shrink further if 1997 / 98 world output does not top 100 million bags next season and importer demand remains at an estimated 75 million bags . 
&quot; already there are indications that the ( 1997 / 98 ) Brazilian crop might be at least 2.0 million bags smaller , &quot; the report said . 
&quot; Robusta output is expected to fall by 1.0 million to 2.0 million bags as well . 
Colombia could expand output by 2.0 million to 2.5 million bags , but this would still leave a gap of 1.0 milliion to 1.5 million bags just to match this season &apos;s output of 97.6 million bags . 
&quot; Thus next season , the situation might become even more precarious , &quot; the Merrill Lynch report said . 
&quot; The one difference is that availability of better quality coffee won &apos;t be as sparse and therefore the extent of the markets reaction might be muted .
