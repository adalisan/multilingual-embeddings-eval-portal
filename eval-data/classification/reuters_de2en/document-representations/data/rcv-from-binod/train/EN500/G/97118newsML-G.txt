Egypt &apos;s main human rights group said on Friday the introduction of &quot; real democracy &quot; was needed to limit the adoption of violence as the only means for change in the country . 
the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights ( EOHR ) censured the government &apos;s attitude to disputes arising from parliamentary elections in 1995 , for which the courts have annulled the results for 200 of the 444 seats . 
Parliament , which under article 93 of the constitution has the final say on the disputes , has ignored all the court rulings . 
it has called no new elections and all the initial winners , mostly government supporters , retain their seats . 
the elections , in November and December 1995 , were widely described as the most violent and most irregular in Egypt &apos;s modern history . 
at least 30 people were killed and election monitors received thousands of complaints of abuses . 
EOHR said in a statement that the system should be changed in order to provide the right atmosphere for making Egypt more democratic . 
&quot; The government deliberately breaks the principle of the separation of powers when it neglects court rulings , giving unacceptable reasons and justifications which are inconsistent with the concepts of democracy and freedom , &quot; it said . 
this article makes the defendant arbiter at the same time , smashing the principal of judicial supervision , &quot; it added . 
&quot; Without development ( towards democracy ) , violence will continue to be the only possible way for change in Egypt . 
establishing real democractic values in Egypt ... is a major means to limit the adoption of violence , &quot; it added . 
it was referring to a campaign of political violence by Islamist militants , in which more than 1,000 people have been killed in Egypt in the last four years . 
the organisation said that the Court of Cassation , the court of last resort for most cases , had so far upheld 200 out of 915 challenges to the election results , annulling the results in those 200 seats . 
it has rejected 120 challenges and has not yet ruled on the remaining suits .
