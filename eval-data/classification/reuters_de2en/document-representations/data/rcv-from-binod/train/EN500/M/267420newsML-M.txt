soybean basis offers were unchanged in lackluster dealings Thursday , brokers said . 
the upcoming Christmas holiday and the impending expiration of the CBOT December soymeal contract has dulled enthusiasm for trading , some sources said . 
&quot; It &apos;s quiet , dead quiet , &quot; one Indiana broker said . 
&quot; A lot of guys are going to take next week off , so its going to be pretty slow on the buy and sell side for the next week or so . 
December still holds a heavy premium to January , and many dealers were expecting a volatile expiration . 
the trade is looking for the National oilseed Processors Association to again report a strong crushing pace because there were few incidences of downtime , dealers said . 
estimates for the crush ranged from 29.8 million to 30.6 million bushels . 
those estimates compare with last week &apos;s crush of 30.7 million bushels .
