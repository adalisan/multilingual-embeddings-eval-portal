the U.S. men &apos;s medley relay team outshone American Jenny Thompson and Samantha Riley of Australia on the last day of the Pan Pacific swimming championships on Wednesday . 
the team of Lenny Krayzelburg , Kurt Grote , Nathaniel Dusing and Neil Walker equalled the second-fastest time ever of three minutes 36.93 seconds in easily winning the men &apos;s 4x100 medley relay . 
the time was equal to the U.S. gold-medal winning times at the Seoul and Barcelona Olympics . 
the world record of 3 : 34.84 was set by the U.S. team at the Atlanta Olympics . 
Thompson picked up her fifth gold medal and Riley blasted away from the field in the women &apos;s 200 metres breaststroke in the fourth-fastest time ever . 
the United States won six of the 10 finals on offer to finish the four-day event with 19 . 
Australia were second with 10 . 
Thompson anchored the U.S. team to victory in the women &apos;s 4x100 medley relay but said she was a little disappointed not to have won six golds after Olympic champion Le Jingyi of China edged her in the women &apos;s 50 freestyle . 
&quot; I wanted to win six golds , but I couldn &apos;t quite do it , &quot; said Thompson , who has won five Olympic gold medals . 
I kind of glided into the wall and that cost me the race . 
Riley &apos;s impressive win in 2 : 25.34 seconds nudged her a little closer to compatriot Rebecca Brown &apos;s 1994 world record of 2 : 24.76 . 
&quot; I was a little disappointed about not breaking the world record , but I think it &apos;s just a matter of time , &quot; Riley said . 
Japan &apos;s Masami Tanaka was second while Riley &apos;s South African rival and double Olympic champion Penny Heyns faded to sixth . 
Riley earlier beat Heyns in the 100 breaststroke . 
American Kristine Quance &apos;s time of 2 : 13.79 gave her a gold in the 200 individual medley to add to her earlier 400 individual medley title . 
Canadian Marianne Limpert was second . 
Grote won the men &apos;s 200 breaststroke final in 2 : 14.05 , beating Japan &apos;s Yoshiaki Okita and fellow American Tom Wilkens . 
in the women &apos;s 800 freestyle , Olympic champion Brooke Bennett pulled steadily away to win in 8 : 26.36 . 
&quot; I wanted to take it out hard , get comfortable and take the lead , &quot; the American said . 
Costa Rica &apos;s Claudia poll , who won the 200 and 400 freestyle races , finished second in 8 : 29.05 . 
Australia &apos;s Matthew Dunn edged out Canada &apos;s Curtis Myden and American Ron Karnaugh to take the men &apos;s 200 individual medley . 
Karnaugh , 31 , was the oldest swimmer in Fukuoka . 
the men &apos;s 50 freestyle gold was shared between Puerto Rico &apos;s Ricardo Busquests and American William Pilczuk after they finished in 22.42 , and Australia &apos;s 17-year-old Grant Hackett overcame a fever to win the men &apos;s 1,500 freestyle in 15 : 13.25 . 
World-record holder Le gave China their sole gold with her 50 freestyle win over Thompson , who earlier edged Le out in the 100 freestyle . 
China won only four medals in Fukuoka , three by Le who also had two silvers . 
she holds world records in both the 50 and 100 freestyle . 
&quot; I was not satisfied with my performance , &quot; Le said , adding she was in training for the Chinese national championships in October , from which China will select their team for the world championships in Perth in January . 
China brought only five swimmers , compared with 52 for the United States and 34 for Australia . 
about 300 swimmers from 22 countries and regions competed in the Pan Pacific championships , which are held every two years with the next meet in Sydney .
