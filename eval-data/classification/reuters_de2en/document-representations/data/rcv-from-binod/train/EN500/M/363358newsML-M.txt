CME pork belly futures shot up late on short covering and finished sharply higher despite late evening of positions that pared best levels . 
hog futures also ended mostly higher on short covering , traders said . 
pork bellies finished 1.300 to 0.525 cent per lb higher with February up 1.300 at 77.625 cents and March also closed up 1.300 at 77.150 cent . 
hog futures ended up 0.425 to off 0.025 with April up 0.350 at 74.050 cents . 
pork belly futures showed short-covering support much of the day and after holding technical support , rallied sharply late on buy stops , traders said . 
February held a major trend line on the charts after a two-week decline and penetrating of minor chort points . 
with trading light early ahead of first notice day for deliveries on Monday and lack of selling on continued weak cash , locals covered shorts into the stops , they said . 
short covering also developed in hog futures , partly from an improved outlook for cash hogs early next week . 
early indications for Monday were for $ 0.50 to $ 1.00 per cwt lower hogs but calls firmed to steady-weak as Friday unfolded . 
hog runs appeared to have eased Friday after being more than adequate to meet packer needs into the weekend , sources said . 
&quot; runs came out lighter than expected , &quot; one trader noted . 
April also held technical support at 73.400 cents , the day &apos;s low , which added to support in that month . 
however , scale up resistance remained as cash pork prices remained under pressure , they said . 
Packer demand for hogs is not expected to strengthen much due to the weak cash pork values . 
also , Lent is drawing near and demand for most pork items usually declines going into the Easter holiday , some sources noted . 
Rand Financials bought April while ABN Chicogo Corp and Rosenthal Collins bought June . 
Cargill investor Services was on both sides of the market , pit sources said . 
in hog options , trading remained very light with volatility down in February ahead of its expiration . 
April volatility was also lower , pit sources added .
