the dollar jumped half a pfennig on Thursday in a knee-jerk move on surprise news Russian President Boris Yeltsin sacked security chief Alexander Lebed . 
the sacking will increase uncertainty about the political situation in Russia , analysts said . 
but currency reaction was fairly restrained as dealers pondered what might happen next . 
&quot; This is disturbing news for European assets given the potential for increased political instability in Russia , &quot; said Keith Edmonds , chief analyst at Japanese bank IBJ International in London . 
the key question now is what Lebed &apos;s next move will be . 
&quot; It all depends now on whether he will sit back or fight back , &quot; said Jeremy stretch , currency strategist at UK securities house Nat West Markets in London . 
&quot; Given his personality one wouldn &apos;t expect Lebed to retire and do nothing . 
so it &apos;s likely the concerted power struggle will intensify , &quot; said stretch . 
at 1530 GMT the dollar stood at 1.5430 marks , just off a high at 1.5440 and up from 1.5377 in late Europe on Wednesday . 
the mark typically suffers from political instability in Russia given its geographical proximity and Germany &apos;s economic links with the country . 
Yeltsin sacked Lebed after just four months in office , saying he could no longer tolerate his lack of team spirit and obvious ambition to become Russia &apos;s next leader . 
on Wednesday , Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov clashed with Lebed , accusing him of preparing to use force to seize power in the Kremlin . 
Lebed had been drawn into a bitter power struggle with other Kremlin officials since Yeltsin said in early September he was preparing to undergo heart surgery . 
&quot; It is a dangerous situation to be in for Yeltsin since he now has a rival who can roam free , &quot; said IBJ &apos;s Edmonds . 
Lebed joined Yeltsin &apos;s team as security advisor and secretary of the powerful Security Council after he won 15 percent of the vote in the first round of Russia &apos;s presidental election . 
Lebed , whose blunt views are more popular outside the Kremlin than inside , might become a magnet for the opposition . 
during the last election Lebed raised concern among foreign investors by proposing tighter restrictions on visas for foreigners , citing fears of &quot; foreign thieves &quot; . 
a more pronounced impact on the mark is expected if the power struggle turns into a full-blown political vaccum . 
&quot; The market is likely to get more nervous once Yeltsin has his heart surgery , if the situation isn &apos;t resolved until then , &quot; said stretch . 
for now , the power struggle is an added advantage for an already buoyant dollar . 
the U.S. currency &apos;s next big target is the 1996 high at 1.5488 marks , hit on May 28 . 
&quot; The dollar is looking very perky , and the market wants it to go higher , &quot; said David Bloom , currency strategist at HSBC James Capel in London . 
dollar / yen was sidelined , trading slighly higher at 112.18 , compared with 112.012 in late Europe on Wednesday . 
U.S. trade data for August , due at 1230 GMT on Friday , might give the dollar another shot in the arm as economists expect the deficit to narrow from a gaping $ 11.7 billion in July . 
the average forecast is for a deficit of about $ 9.5 billion . 
&quot; The trade data should be much better news this time as exports are expected to make a comeback , &quot; said Teis Knuthsen , international economist at First Chicago in London . 
they included a surprise 6.0 percent drop in September housing starts , while an 18,000 rise in weekly jobless claims pointed to an unexpectedly softer labour market .
