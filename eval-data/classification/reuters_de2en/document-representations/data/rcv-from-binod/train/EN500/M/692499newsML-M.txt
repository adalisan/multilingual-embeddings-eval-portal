U.S. Municipal bond cash prices ended unchanged to 1 / 8 point higher Friday , shored up by stronger gains in U.S. treasuries . 
&quot; It was more of a government market rally today than munis , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; I think prices were up begrudgingly in spots by maybe 1 / 8 of a point , not any real volume . 
in the government market , the benchmark 30-year bond closed up 14 / 32 at 98-14 / 32 to yield 6.75 percent . 
the higher close marked the end of a week-long slump , and stemmed from the Federal Reserve &apos;s purchase of coupons as well as shortcovering . 
in debt futures , the September municipal contract closed up 7 / 32 at 116-26 / 32 . 
the September T-bond contract closed up 15 / 32 at 111-20 / 32 . 
back in munis , players were mindful of the short July 4 holiday work week , which is expected to bring only scant supply , the trader said . 
negotiated and competitive deals are expected to total just $ 1.16 billion next week , far short of this week &apos;s roughly $ 7 billion in sales , according to Reuters Municipal Bond Information Group . 
&quot; I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s necessarily going to be good for prices unless we start seeing some wirehouse business , &quot; the trader said , referring to firms that have access to a large number of retail investors . 
&quot; yields probably went up 10 to 15 basis points this week , probably closer to 10 in most cases , and if that attracts any wirehouse business then you could start getting some bonds taken out of the market , &quot; he said . 
on the other hand , the market may just mark time next week to see how the overall interest rate picture develops , and what happens with supply heading into July , the trader said . 
the Federal Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday , but no rate action is expected .
