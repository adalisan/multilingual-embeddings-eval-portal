the key September 10-year Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures contract ended sharply higher in Tokyo on Wednesday , propelled upwards by the yen &apos;s surge against the dollar and a drop in interest rate swap ( IRS ) rates , traders said . 
the dollar fell to as low as 110.81 yen as of 0600 GMT , according to the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) , and bond traders said this had become the day &apos;s major factor . 
key September closed at 123.74 , the day &apos;s high and up 0.60 from Tuesday &apos;s close . 
its low was 123.24 and trading volume was 46,577 contracts . 
the yield on the benchmark 10-year 182nd cash bond stood at 2.415 percent against 2.480 percent at Tuesday &apos;s close . 
&quot; The market is definitely taking its cues from the foreign exchange market right now , &quot; said a trader at a city bank . 
he added that a dollar slide into the lower end of the 110-111 yen range could push the September futures contract as high as 124.50 and the yield on the cash benchmark as low as 2.3 percent . 
&quot; But moves this extreme are unlikely , &quot; he said . 
the key September &apos;s successful achievement of an important technical point of 123.73 during the day may well signal a rise to 124.00 , perhaps as early as Thursday , he added . 
three-year IRS rates were quoted at 1.49 / 1.53 percent late Wednesday against 1.61 / 1.65 percent Tuesday , with five-year rates quoted at 2.05 / 2.09 percent against 2.15 / 2.19 percent . 
the BOJ injected 300 billion yen into the money market in its regular morning operation , leaving the market in surplus by 300 billion yen and helping boost JGBs during morning trade . 
although long-term factors seem positive for JGBs , the topside may be limited on supply concerns , traders said . 
in the short-term , the topside may be capped by the launch of around 300 billion to 400 billion yen worth of corporate straight bonds expected this week and next . 
Mitsubishi Estate Co Ltd launched a total of 30 billion yen in straight bonds on Wednesday and firms such as Anritsu Corp and Nihon cement Co Ltd are expected to follow later this week . 
Fujitsu Ltd is expected to launch 100 billion yen of straight bonds next week , one trader said . 
but traders said that in the long-term , increasing concerns about the economy , particularly in connection with the stronger yen , are expected to support the market .
