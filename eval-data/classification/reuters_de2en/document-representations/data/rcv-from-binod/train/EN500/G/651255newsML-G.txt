France on Tuesday corrected the number of extra troops it had rushed to the Congolese capital Brazzaville from 800 to 400 , saying the higher figure announced earlier had been a error . 
the 400 reinforcements would bring the total French troop presence in the strife-torn city to 850 and not 1,200 as announced on Monday , a spokesman for the army &apos;s public relations branch said . 
&quot; We have to rectify the figures we gave earlier . 
in fact , among those counted yesterday were troops heading from France to Chad to replace troops which went from Chad to Brazza , &quot; he said . 
the troops which headed for Brazzaville from the Chad capital Ndjamena on Monday included one reinforced company from the Foreign Legion &apos;s 2nd infantry Regiment and one from the marines &apos; 8th Parachute Regiment , he said . 
foreign Legion paratroopers , who have been on standby for weeks in Brazzaville for a possible evacuation of foreigners from the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo , already helped protect and evacuate foreign civilians trapped in fighting between political and ethnic militias . 
a corporal was killed and five soldiers were wounded earlier this week . 
a spokeswoman for French President Jacques Chirac said late on Monday that he had won agreement for a ceasefire from the warring sides but there was no indication in Paris on Tuesday that fighting had abated . 
Chirac &apos;s spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said he had received verbal agreement for a ceasefire in telephone conversations with President Pascal Lissouba and his opponent , former president Denis Sassou-Nguesso .
