Palestinians are not preparing for a new &quot; intifada &quot; or uprising against Israel , despite the clashes which have claimed amost 70 lives in four days , PLO official Faisal al-Husseini told the German weekly Der Spiegel . 
but he cautioned that it might not be possible to prevent violent reactions , even by Palestinian police , if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s government did not show more interest in continuing the peace process . 
the violence followed an Israeli decision to open to the public an archaeological tunnel near Moslem shrines in Jerusalem and Palestinian accusations that Israel has failed to comply with the terms of signed peace accords . 
Husseini , the leading Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) official in Jerusalem , told the magazine the decisive spark in the unrest had not been the tunnel opening itself but Israel &apos;s &quot; lack of feeling for the sensitivity of the situation &quot; . 
&quot; They carry out changes in their own favour before negotiations about the final status of Jerusalem have even begun , &quot; he told the magazine , according to an advance release from Monday &apos;s edition . 
he said Palestinians now had an administration which provided them with an alternative to violent protest like the &quot; intifada &quot; uprising , launched in 1987 . 
&quot; In contrast to the days of the intifada , the Palestinians now have a government . 
the way of orderly negotiations is known . 
only , the Israelis must really want to walk along it . 
&quot; If the Palestinians continue to get the feeling that the Israelis are not interested in continuing with the peace process , the Palestinian government will not be able to control the people , and not always its own armed police . 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under increasing pressure from Western governments to push ahead with the peace process , which has stalled in the three months since he came to power . 
Husseini said that while the Palestinians often argued with Netanyahu &apos;s predecessors Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres , &quot; we always had the clear feeling that the Israeli side really want to reach agreement &quot; . 
with Netanyahu this was not the case . 
Husseini said Israel must come up with a clear negotiating mandate and take measures such as removing road checks on the way in to Palestinian towns . 
&quot; Such provocations have only one purpose : the Israelis want to prove to us every day who is the boss around here . 
but this attitude is poison for the peace process , &quot; he said . 
the leader of Germany &apos;s Jewish community , Ignatz Bubis , also criticised the opening of the tunnel and said Israel must take a large part of the blame for the outbreak of violence . 
&quot; This is much too dramatic an issue simply to put it down to stupidity , &quot; Bubis told the Berlin radio station News talk . 
&quot; At a time of enormous tension , ( Palestinian President Yasser ) Arafat had to see this move as a provocation .
