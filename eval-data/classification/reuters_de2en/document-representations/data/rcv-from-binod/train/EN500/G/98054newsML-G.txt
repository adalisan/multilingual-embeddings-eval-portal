Britain &apos;s Guardian newspaper accused senior Conservatives on Saturday of trying to cover up a cash for questions scandal suggesting widespread sleaze in the ruling party . 
the left-leaning newspaper said it feared the full truth would never be known of the affair involving former junior trade minister Neil Hamilton . 
Hamilton sensationally dropped a libel case against the Guardian on the eve of the trial this week in which Prime Minister John Major and deputy premier Michael Heseltine had been called as witnesses . 
the Guardian said it had evidence gathered for the aborted libel case which showed that &quot; the Conservative Party , through senior party and government members , have conspired to prevent a full public airing of the facts about Neil Hamilton &quot; . 
it said it could not publish the document , disclosed by the Treasury , for legal reasons . 
but editor Alan Rusbridger said in a statement ; &quot; This is evidence of the cover-up we always suspected . 
it shows the government &apos;s first instinct when dealing with this affair was to stifle it . 
Prime Minister John Major has agreed to cooperate fully with a new investigation by parliament &apos;s Commissioner for Standards into what the Guardian has claimed is a &quot; nauseating picture of MPs on the take &quot; . 
a spokesman for Major &apos;s office said on Saturday the government did not want to prejudge that investigation and had nothing to add . 
Hamilton resigned as trade minister in 1994 after he was accused of accepting money from Mohammed al-Fayed , the Egyptian-born owner of London &apos;s luxury Harrods store , in return for tabling questions in parliament . 
he fiercely denied the allegations but this week admitted accepting payments totalling 10,000 pounds ( $ 15,600 ) from a parliamentary lobbyist . 
he has insisted the money was paid only for introducing clients . 
Hamilton had previously been questioned by senior ministers and by a parliamentary committee about the allegations . 
Saturday &apos;s Guardian said Hamilton had misled ministers in his conversations and it detailed a string of restrictions placed on the proceedings of the parliamentary committee . 
it said it had sent the Treasury document to Major and to the leaders of the opposition Labour and Liberal Democrat parties . 
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said : &quot; This extraordinary and shocking document raises the gravest concerns about the integrity of the government and the extent to which it is prepared to pervert the procedures of the House of Commons and its committees for its own purposes .
