emerging markets debt rose in line with U.S. treasuries Thursday , tiring of its recent focus on unfolding Brazil bribery allegations , market experts said . 
&quot; Right now , the market is more driven by ( U.S. ) treasuries and by expectations about ( U.S. ) monetary policy , &quot; said Kurt Schmid , head of propietary trading at SBC Warburg . 
&quot; Fundamental local news is , at this point , not necessarily dominant . 
Brady bonds traded lower with U.S. treasuries after reports on U.S. consumer prices and jobless claims , but most rebounded after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia &apos;s business outlook survey came in weaker than expected . 
Brazil &quot; C &quot; bonds were unchanged at 76-1 / 8 bid , holding steady despite further reports of alleged corruption in newspaper Folha de Sao Paolo . 
on Thursday , Folha said taped telephone converstations suggested a high-level Cabinet member traded a television concession as well as cash for a legislator &apos;s vote on the key reelection amendment . 
&quot; The Brazilian scandal had a significant market impact up to yesterday , &quot; a Brady trader said . 
&quot; At this point , it seems the issue can be contained and it &apos;s business as usual . 
investors remain cautious but optimistic about the developing situation , he said . 
while the bribery allegations had the potential to delay privatization or reform efforts , next week &apos;s U.S. monetary policy meeting remained a more immediate focus , analyst said . 
most other Latin American Bradys rose Thursday . 
Argentina FRBs were up 1 / 4 at 92-3 / 8 , and Mexico pars were up 1 / 8 at 74 bid . 
murmurs that Mexico may buy back some of its Brady debt with proceeds from the new sterling Eurobond persisted Thursday , but traders extended the rumors little credence . 
&quot; There &apos;s nothing concrete -- it &apos;s just been a rumor floating around for three or four days , &quot; a Brady trader said . 
European Brady debt turned in a more-mixed performance . 
Bulgaria FLRBs were up 1 / 4 to 51 bid , Poland discounts were unchanged at 98-3 / 8 and dollar-denominated Russian Vnesh loans were up 5 / 8 at 84-1 / 2 bid .
