Spanish government bonds closed largely unchanged on Friday after an active session in which the short-end sparkled and the long-end languished , dealers said . 
curve trades focused much of the session &apos;s activity , with selling at the long end and buying at the short end . 
&quot; There appears to be a lot more confidence in the short end , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; This is backed up by the difference in spreads between the short and long end . 
dealers said the trend in Bunds continued to provide direction for bonos . 
Spanish bonds drew strength in late trade from a fall in the dollar , they added .
