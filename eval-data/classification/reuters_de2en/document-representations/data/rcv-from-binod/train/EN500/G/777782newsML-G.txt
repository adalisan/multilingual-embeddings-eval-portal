the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday a Federal judge agreed to freeze a California investment adviser &apos;s business assets after the agency sued him for allegedly bilking his clients out of millions of dollars . 
the agency said it received the preliminary injunction Tuesday after suing Emmanuel Lagpacan of Layfayette , Calif . , on August 1 on allegations he fraudulently offered and sold about $ 4.4 million in &quot; phony securities &quot; to 73 of his clients . 
&quot; Of the more than $ 4.4 million Lagpacan raised through this scheme , he still owes least $ 3.1 million of this amount to approximately 50 investors located in California and five other states , &quot; the SEC said in its complaint . 
Lagpacon , without admitting any wrongdoing agreed to the asset freeze . 
in its complaint , the SEC said Lagpacan used the investor proceeds to buy real estate even though he told the investors their funds would be placed in low-risk , government-insured investments . 
in recent months , Lagpacan has begun selling the properties purchased with investor funds and &quot; distributing the proceeds unfairly to a small number of favored clients , &quot; the agency said . 
&quot; More than 40 other clients have received no payments , &quot; the SEC said . 
&quot; Lagpacan has also been lying to clients to cover his earlier fraudulent acts . 
Lagpacan &apos;s attorney said Lagpacan and the others named in the SEC &apos;s suit deny the agency &apos;s allegations .
