doctors said on Thursday that President Boris Yeltsin was recovering normally from his heart operation and there were no problems , Itar-Tass news agency quoted a presidential spokesman as saying . 
a team of doctors met for 90 minutes on Thursday morning to discuss his progress after Tuesday &apos;s operation . 
presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky told TASS the results were &quot; positive and there is nothing untoward &quot; . 
Yastrzhembsky said the doctors had consulted at the Cardiology Research Centre where the 65-year-old president had the quintuple bypass operation . 
TASS did not make clear whether the doctors had seen Yeltsin or had just discussed the results of the operation . 
the presidential press service declined to give further details , saying Yastrzhembsky would hold a news conference later on Thursday . 
Yeltsin , said by doctors to be recovering surprisingly quickly , has asked to be moved to a more convenient clinic to convalesce . 
Yastrzhembsky did not say whether the doctors had agreed to his request . 
pioneering heart surgery expert Michael DeBakey , a consultant at the operation , said on Wednesday that Yeltsin could be back at work after six to eight weeks . 
Yeltsin hopes the surgery , intended to improve the flow of blood to his heart , will allow him to reassert full control in the Kremlin to deal with Russia &apos;s burning economic and political problems .
