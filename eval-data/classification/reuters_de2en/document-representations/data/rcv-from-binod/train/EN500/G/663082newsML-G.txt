international election observers said on Monday Croatia &apos;s presidential election , won by President Franjo Tudjman with 61 percent of the vote , was free but not fair and did not meet democratic standards . 
a report compiled by observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) said &quot; the election process afforded enormous electoral advantages to the ruling party candidate ( Tudjman ) and limited the ability of the two opposition candidates to campaign equally with the incumbent . 
&quot; Croatia has experienced a free but not fair election . 
while candidates were able to speak freely , the process leading up to the election was fundamentally flawed , &quot; U.S. 
Senator Paul Simon , coordinating the monitoring mission organised by the OSCE , said in a statement given to reporters . 
the pre-election process &quot; did not meet the minimum standards for democracies . 
by contrast the election itself was , with some exceptions , conducted efficiently , &quot; it said . 
Ambassador Peter Galbraith told Reuters the American position on the election &quot; corresponded &quot; with that of the OSCE . 
Kare Vollan of the OSCE mission said he regretted that some observers &apos; complaints about Croatia &apos;s 1995 parliamentary vote and municipal elections in April &quot; were not properly addressed &quot; . 
he cited the coverage of the campaign by the state-controlled mainstream media , especially television -- the only source of news for most Croats , and voting by Croats living abroad , particularly in Bosnia . 
expatriate Croats have voted overwhelmingly for Tudjman and his conservative nationalist HDZ party in the past . 
the OSCE said it was concerned Croatia allowed 330,000 Bosnian Croats to vote as Bosnia and Croatia have not signed any bilateral agreement allowing them to do so . 
this violates the Dayton accord which ended Bosnia &apos;s Serb-Moslem-Croat war in 1995 , the OSCE said , and &quot; undermines Croatia &apos;s commitment to a unitary Bosnian state &quot; . 
the Bosnian government in Sarajevo expressed concern that Croatian authorities set up several temporary consular offices without approval from the Moslem-Croat federation . 
an aide to Bosnian presidency chairman Alija Izetbegovic accused Bosnian Foreign Minister Jadranko Prlic , a Croat , of showing more loyalty to Zagreb than to Bosnia &apos;s constitution . 
&quot; I think Tudjman missed a good opportunity to show that he respects the sovereignty of this country , &quot; he said . 
the OSCE report said the coverage of Tudjman on the main television evening news during the campaign was 300 times greater than that of Zdravko Tomac of the Social Democratic party and 12 times greater than that of Vlado Gotovac of the Social Liberal party . 
it calculated coverage to the second . 
before the poll , both opposition candidates had already branded the campaign biased and undemocratic because of Tudjman &apos;s hold over a subservient state media , and accused him of using his position to promote his candidacy . 
&quot; This election was not democratic . 
Gotovac and I were in such a disadvantageous position that any result we achieved would be a good result , &quot; Tomac said after voting on Sunday . 
with 90 percent of the votes counted on Monday , Tudjman had 61 percent , Tomac 21 and Gotovac 18 percent . 
Simon said Tudjman would have probably been re-elected &quot; regardless of the problems , but perhaps it would have been a closer contest &quot; . 
Simon , a veteran U.S. senator , was appointed Special Coordinator for the election observation mission in Croatia , which was established a month before the vote . 
&quot; You cannot separate the democratic process from economic growth . 
if the leadership of this country wants to move ahead , be part of Europe , prosper economically , it has to make proper adjustments , &quot; he told reporters . 
Simon said it would take time for democracy to develop in Croatia . 
&quot; We don &apos;t move from communist states to full democracy overnight . 
these are recommendations we make . 
it &apos;s up to them to consider and , we hope , act upon . 
but he was optimistic there would be changes . 
&quot; From my experience , when people of a nation are told their election was not up to international standards , people frequently improve .
