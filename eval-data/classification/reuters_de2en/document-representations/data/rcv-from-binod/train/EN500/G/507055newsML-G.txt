the Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether the federal government may impose a civil monetary penalty for regulatory violations and then bring a criminal prosecution for the same underlying conduct . 
the justices will consider whether the successive cases amounted to a violation of the constitutional right protecting against double jeopardy -- being tried and punished twice for the same offence . 
the high court will hear arguments in the case during its term that begins in October , with a decision expected next year . 
the Justice Department argued that the constitutional protection involving double jeopardy only applied to punishment from criminal prosecutions , not from civil cases . 
still , Acting solicitor General Walter Dellinger of the Justice Department urged the high court to decide the issue because of differing lower-court rulings and because it presented a &quot; recurring and important &quot; question . 
&quot; Many federal agencies are authorised to seek civil money penalties for regulatory violations , and such proceedings are often pursued in tandem with referrals for criminal prosecution , based on the same underlying conduct , &quot; he said . 
Dellinger said the high court should decide if a punitive civil sanction ever may bar a later criminal prosecution . 
the high court case involved three executives at two banks in Tipton and Hammon , Oklahoma . 
the comptroller of the currency in 1989 sought a civil monetary penalty against them involving nearly $ 900,000 in loans that led to the failure of the banks . 
the three agreed to pay assessments totalling $ 44,000 . 
a federal grand jury in 1992 then indicted them on criminal charges of conspiracy , misapplication of bank funds and making false bank entries . 
a federal judge dismissed the indictment on double jeopardy grounds , but a U.S. appeals court reinstated the charges . 
it said a civil assessment was not punishment , but was remedial if it relates to compensating the government for its loss .
