Czech central bank Governor Josef Tosovsky said on Thursday he saw no rational reason for the crown &apos;s current rise . 
the crown has gained some two percentage points against its dollar / mark basket since mid-December . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see any rational reason for the strengthening of the crown in the past few days , &quot; he told a news conference . 
&quot; We widened the band so the crown could move freely within it and that a strong crown is the long-term policy of the central bank , &quot; he added . 
the crown is fixed daily by the central bank within + / -7.5 percent of the midpoint of its 65 / 35 dollar / mark basket . 
dealers said the crown has been driven higher by an estimated 23 billion crowns worth of crown-denominated Eurobonds since the start of the year . 
&quot; Obviously , there was a large issue of Eurobonds in recent days , but we do not see any macro-economic reasons for such an issue , &quot; he said . 
asked if there was a herd mentality in issuing these bonds , Tosovsky said &quot; Yes . 
the crown was at 27.837 to the dollar and 16.995 to the mark in early Thursday activity . 
the rates imply a deviation of 4.36 percent above the basket mid-point .
