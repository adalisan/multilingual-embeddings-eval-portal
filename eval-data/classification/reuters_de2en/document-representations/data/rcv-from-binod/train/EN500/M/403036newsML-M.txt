Singapore blue chip shares were weaker early on Tuesday , hamstrung by recent re-weightings , but small capitalisation issues drew renewed interest , dealers said . 
foreign tranches of bank stocks rebounded after Monday &apos;s heavy sell-off following Morgan Stanley Capital International &apos;s ( MSCI ) plans to revise the Singapore Index . 
however , sentiment was still dampened by anticipation of further profit taking , especially in the lead up to the season &apos;s earnings results . 
&quot; Investors are downsizing their portfolios and switching over to Malaysian stocks , &quot; one local brokerage dealer said . 
at 0230 GMT , the Straits Times Industrials Index was down 9.35 points to 2,224.64 on a volume of 143 million shares . 
Malaysian second and third liners and small capitalisation local stocks remained in the front lines .
