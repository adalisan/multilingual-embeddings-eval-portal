restricted imports cushioned the impact of sluggish industrial demand to keep base metals steady in a narrow price band on Wednesday , dealers said . 
&quot; Demand from the industrial consumers remained sluggish but limited arrivals of the imported metals kept prices around previous level , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; The supply is from scattered offerings by state-owned agencies while inflow of imported metals is at low ebb , &quot; said Sharad Parikh , president of the Bombay Metal Exchange . 
ready copper was steady at 13,050 rupees per quintal , after falling 50 rupees on Tuesday . 
it was up 250 rupees last week . 
aluminium was available at the previous level of 7,250 rupees per quintal as was zinc at 6,900 rupees and lead at 4,550 rupees per quintal but volumes were low .
