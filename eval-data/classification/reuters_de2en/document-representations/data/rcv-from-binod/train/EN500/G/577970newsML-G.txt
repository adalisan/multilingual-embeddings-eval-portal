billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke dropped plans to build a luxurious holiday house on an island near Oslo after angering his fellow Norwegians who felt he was flaunting his wealth . 
&quot; I don &apos;t want to mess with the soul of the Norwegian people , &quot; said Roekke , an entrepreneur whose rags-to-riches career has been frontpage news for the past year . 
&quot; The house ... would have been useful and great fun for myself , my family and my friends . 
but my purchase ( of the island ) has obviously been a pest and a plague to many , &quot; Roekke told the financial daily Dagens Naeringsliv . 
&quot; Enough is enough . 
Roekke has fallen foul of &quot; Jantelaw &quot; , an expression coined by the late Norwegian author Aksel Sandemose to describe the petty social control in a small town . 
&quot; You must not believe you are someone , &quot; reads the first of 10 &quot; commandments &quot; in Sandemose &apos;s book , published in 1933 . 
&quot; You must not believe you are better than us , &quot; another says . 
the &quot; Jantelaw &quot; mentality is believed to have its roots in Protestant puritanism , the historical absence of an aristocracy in Norway and the egalitarian values of the Social Democrats who for decades have dominated political life in Scandinavia . 
Roekke , 38 , began his career as a penniless 17-year-old on a fish factory trawler in the Arctic . 
today his seafood business is the world &apos;s largest white-fish fishing and processing operation . 
his investment group RGI , one of Norway &apos;s youngest firms , last year merged with the industrial group Aker , one of Norway &apos;s oldest companies , to form a big player on the corporate scene . 
many Norwegians disapprove of the lifestyle of people like Roekke -- whose hobbies include speedboat racing and travelling in his private jet -- whom they regard as upstarts . 
&quot; We need laws that come into effect when some individuals lose contact with Earth and take to the skies , &quot; Yngve Haagensen , leader of the powerful Confederation of Trade Unions ( LO ) , said in a Labour Day speech . 
&quot; Ordinary people don &apos;t understand the point of having luxury-class cabins , houses , boats and cars . 
the German essayist Hans Magnus Enzensberger in 1984 summed up Norwegian attitudes on private consumption in &quot; Norwegian anachronisms &quot; , a book which has become a classic for observers of Norway , a country of 4.3 million tucked away in the northern backwaters of Europe . 
&quot; The clocks have always ticked differently in Norway , &quot; he wrote . 
&quot; Private consumption in Norway is rather seen as a necessary evil , and there is just a hairline border separating it from sinful excesses . 
where the permitted ends and the sinful begins is a question it takes considerable moral sensitivity to answer . 
&quot; A wealthy citizen would rather anchor his yacht in a remote corner of the bay than face the risk of annoying his neighbour with the provocative pop of a champagne cork , &quot; Enzensberger wrote . 
while Roekke now plans to sell his 10-million-crown ( $ 1.4 million ) island , he said he would not stop the construction of a big yacht for himself , adding : &quot; This boat is not being built in Norway and it will probably be sailed in foreign waters &quot; . 
&quot; I hope my announcement will make people focus on my business activities rather than on me . 
Kristin Halvorsen , chairwoman of the Socialist Left Party , which is represented in parliament , was pleased with Roekke &apos;s atonement . 
&quot; It is a good thing that Roekke has realised he needs goodwill if he is to conduct serious business , &quot; she said . 
&quot; But I did not know it was so easy to frighten him . 
Eduardo Archetti , professor of social anthropology at Oslo University , said Roekke was popular with many Norwegians because he was self-made , but his mistake was his lack of humility . 
&quot; Once he started showing off his fortune like an eccentric American millionaire he lost prestige , &quot; said Archetti , who is Argentinian . 
&quot; Roekke &apos;s story is the best illustration of the Jantelaw , of Norwegian values . 
Norwegians pay some of the highest personal tax rates in the world , but a tax rebellion is unthinkable . 
&quot; Norwegians imagine themselves as equals . 
there can be no fundamental difference in the control of and access to material goods , &quot; Archetti said . 
&quot; The billionaire must send his children to the same school as the electrician &apos;s kids . 
citizens may conform with egalitarian moral values and frown on success or lavish spending by individuals , but they are staunch nationalists and happily cheer on highly-paid Norwegian elite athletes at the Olympic Games and World Cup . 
however , there is no contradiction . 
&quot; When Norwegians win gold medals at international sports events they do it against non-Norwegians , &quot; Archetti explained . 
&quot; It is accepted to be better than foreigners . 
collectively , Norwegians often see themselves as champions of the quality of life thanks to their cradle-to-grave welfare society , low crime rate , low unemployment , and beautiful landscape with steep mountains and deep fjords . 
&quot; The whole world looks up to Norway . 
Norway is one of the happiest countries in the world , &quot; boated a recent frontpage headline in Dagens Naeringsliv . 
it cited an international study on the quality of life in which Norway ranked 6th among 46 countries . 
&quot; We are almost best at almost everything . 
buoyed by offshore petroleum reserves , Norway is wealthy enough to afford to stay outside the European Union . 
Norwegians in 1994 voted for the second time in 20 years against joining . 
&quot; There is an ideology in Norway which says no other country can match it in terms of quality of life , &quot; Archetti said . 
but while Norway offers welfare , clean air and great outdoors , it levies heavy taxes on liquor , tobacco , restaurant food , petrol , cars and other items deemed as luxuries . 
half a litre of beer in an Oslo pub costs about 50 crowns . 
&quot; Norway is a place where you are punished with high prices for trying to be social and go out on the town , &quot; Archetti said . 
&quot; Norwegian quality of life is about staying at home or being in nature .
