President Bill Clinton &apos;s appointment of Madeleine Albright as secretary of state on Thursday had women &apos;s leaders wildly applauding what several termed a historic breakthrough for American women . 
&quot; What we &apos;ve seen today is definitely a glass ceiling being shattered , &quot; said Ellen Malcolm , chairwoman of Emily &apos;s List , an organisation that raises funds to help women get elected to political office . 
women leaders stressed that Albright got the job on merit but said the fact that she was a woman might have helped her edge out some of her male rivals . 
&quot; She didn &apos;t get it because she was a woman . 
she got it because she &apos;s qualified . 
but having said that , this is huge for women all over the world , &quot; said Democratic political consultant Jennifer Laszlo . 
Clinton himself stressed the same point . 
&quot; I am very proud to have had the opportunity to appoint the first woman secretary of state in the history of America , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But it had nothing to do with her getting the job , one way or the other . 
she got the job because I believe , amid a list of truly outstanding people , she had the best combination of qualities to succeed and to serve our country at this moment in history , &quot; Clinton said . 
&quot; And I hope that she will be an inspiration to young women all across our country , all across our world , &quot; he added . 
while few questioned Albright &apos;s qualifications , several prominent women leaders said the appointment would also help Clinton politically . 
&quot; President Clinton has been the best president in history in terms of recognising and promoting women to important positions . 
now , finally , we have one at the highest level inside the inner circle , &quot; said Donna Lenhoff , general counsel of the Woman &apos;s Defence Fund . 
&quot; Clinton won the votes of women partly because he took concrete steps to promote the interests of women and families . 
and appointing qualified women to top positions is part of that , &quot; she said . 
in last month &apos;s presidential election , Clinton won the women &apos;s vote by 16 percentage points , while trailing by one point among men -- a 17 point gender gap . 
last week , a delegation of women met Vice President Al Gore and presented him with a list of 40 women within the administration whom they said should be promoted to more senior positions . 
Albright &apos;s name topped the list . 
&quot; This is not a token appointment and it comes at a time when women are being oppressed in some parts of the world more than ever , &quot; said Rosemary Dempsey , national vice president of the National Organisation of Women . 
&quot; It &apos;s historic and it sends an international signal , &quot; she said . 
Jane Tobler of the Business and Professional Women &apos;s Foundation said the appointment could also have an effect in the male-dominated corporate world . 
&quot; It will inspire women working in companies and young girls in their classrooms . 
up until now , we have preached the gospel of women &apos;s equality but we have not been willing to walk the walk , &quot; she said .
