France beat Portugal 2-0 with their best performance since Euro 96 in a soccer friendly on Wednesday but manager Aime Jacquet said the time was ripe to change his winning team . 
now I mean to try plan B against our next opponents , the Netherlands , &quot; said Jacquet , who is preparing France for the World Cup they will be hosting in 1998 . 
the French coach has silenced the critics who said his side were far too defensive and cautious of late . 
but he added he was ready to risk breaking the momentum in order to gear up for the Tournoi de France , a dress rehearsal for the World Cup which will involve Brazil , Italy and England in France next June . 
it &apos;s what I had wished to see for a long time . 
for the first time , my hopes have materialised on the pitch , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We looked so comfortable in this match , especially thanks to our defence , who were very solid &quot; , he added . 
among the players he singled out were Guingamp &apos;s back Vincent Candela and Sampdoria &apos;s Pierre Laigle , one of the players he had decided to see in action once more . 
but the most outstanding player on the Braga pitch was Bordeaux midfielder Ibrahim Ba , who celebrated his first cap with a brilliant second goal after setting up Didier Deschamps &apos; first . 
&quot; Ibrahim Ba played as though he had played for France all his life . 
he played boldly . 
he displays a calm and a technical power which are unbelievable , &quot; said Jacquet in a rare praise . 
he even hinted that the international days of Internazionale &apos;s playmaker Youri Djorkaeff , once a pillar of the team , may be numbered . 
&quot; If we go on playing around Zinedine Zidane and Youri Djorkaeff , we will be going round in circles . 
we need competition , we need changes , &quot; he said . 
Djorkaeff replaced Ba for the last 20 minutes of the match and was most unimpressive . 
but Jacquet , who also recalled AC Milan &apos;s Christophe Dugarry up front , added a lot of things could change before next June . 
&quot; Until the Tournoi de France , parameters will change . 
there may be injured or unavailable players . 
the Italian and English leagues won &apos;t stop just to please us , &quot; he said . 
Jacquet added he had approached English and Italian soccer authorities with the support of World Cup organising committee president Michel Platini to make sure the best players could be released for the tournament , so far in vain . 
&quot; With this match , a page has been turned . 
now my intention is to build a new team to play the Netherlands . 
this match gave me a good picture , now I want to see something else , &quot; he said . 
France host the Dutch in a friendly on February 26 .
