Bangladesh &apos;s Dhaka stock market was expected to continue its bull run , with new investors encouraged by political stability , but analysts said on Monday that the trend was not based on economic reality . 
the Dhaka Stock Exchange ( DSE ) created three records when its benchmark index rose 114.89 points , or 6.07 percent , to 2,005.24 on a volume of 298.9 million taka ( $ 7 million ) at the close of trading on Sunday . 
on Saturday , the index rose 104.09 points , or 5.82 percent , at 1,890.36 on a turnover of 259.2 million taka . 
Sunday is a working day in overwhelmingly Moslem Bangladesh . 
stocks opened higher on Monday as engineering scrips continued to attract investors , but brokers said profit-taking on few stocks might erode the gains by the close . 
&quot; All these ( gains ) are the effects of the present political stablity , &quot; Imtiyaz Husain , chairman of the Dhaka Stock Exchange ( DSE ) , told Reuters on Monday . 
brokers said investor confidence was boosted after former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia , the main opposition leader , said on Saturday that her Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) would avoid conflict to promote industrial growth . 
&quot; BNP will not take up any programme that may hinder the country &apos;s economic activity and social development , &quot; she told a textile export fair attended by foreign importers . 
the DSE index was at 1,145.54 at the close of trading on August 1 . 
the market capitalisation rose to $ 3.3 billion on Sunday from $ 3.1 billion on Saturday and $ 2.0 billion on August 1 . 
it was only $ 452 million at the end of 1994 . 
&quot; The stocks are expensive ... but they are still going strong , &quot; Husain said . 
&quot; The investment growth is far beyond what we can supply , &quot; he said . 
market analysts believe they have more that 2.0 billion taka ( $ 47 million ) to spend . 
one DSE broker said : &quot; It &apos;s very difficult to predict precisely ... but I can say the market will continue to move up until some correction and consolidation are expected next month . 
but the unbridled growth of the market without strong company fundamentals was seen by many as unhealthy . 
&quot; The market is too bullish . 
it &apos;s difficult to say whether such a rise in the prices is sustainable , &quot; said Shahbub Alam , of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , the country &apos; capital market watchdog . 
&quot; The investors should be careful in making investment in such a situation , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The market appears to be very expensive . 
it &apos;s now trading on an extremely high price earnings ... , &quot; said another broker . 
market sources said a 42 million taka initial public offering ( IPO ) by Standard ceramic Industries had been oversubscribed more than 50 times . 
brokers said the rush of funds also had been inspired by the government &apos;s plan to privatise 41 public companies and sell shares of 15 other . 
government officials earlier said 10.65 percent of its shares in Reckitt &amp; Colman , 42.33 percent in Berger ( Bangladesh ) Ltd and 31.66 percent in Siemens Ltd would be sold . 
$ 1 = 42 taka
