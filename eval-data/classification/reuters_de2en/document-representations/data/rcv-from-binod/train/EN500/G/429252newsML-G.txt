a Cypriot court on Sunday ordered two Turks and one Turkish Cypriot detained for eight days on suspicion of spying . 
the Cyprus News Agency said that police found military documents , videos with military information and maps of Greek Cypriot National Guard camps in the men &apos;s possession . 
the three men were living in the coastal town of Limassol in south Cyprus , the mainly Greek Cypriot part of the island under the control of the internationally recognised Cyprus government . 
Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish sections since 1974 , when Turkish troops invaded in response to a Greek Cypriot coup backed by the military regime then ruling Athens . 
negotiations to unite the two communities in a bicommunal federation have stalled .
