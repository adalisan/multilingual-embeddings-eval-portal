Greg Maddux won his fourth straight decision and Atlanta continued its torrid scoring as the braves routed the Pittsburgh Pirates 10-2 Monday to take the final three games of their four-game series . 
Maddux ( 4-1 ) pitched five innings and allowed a run and six hits . 
he walked none and struck out seven . 
he improved to 13-13 in his career against Pittsburgh , leaving Cincinatti as the only National League team he has a losing record against . 
Maddux threw only 68 pitches before leaving with an eight-run lead . 
relievers Alan Embree , Brad Clontz and Joe Borowski allowed just one run and six hits over the final four innings . 
&quot; If I can save an inning here or there the only possible thing it can do is help , &quot; said Maddux . 
&quot; It &apos;s not going to hurt you . 
we scored a lot of runs . 
the guys picked me up , it was nice . 
after getting shut out 9-0 in the series opener Friday , the braves outscored the Pirates 27-7 in winning the last three contests , completing a 5-3 road trip . 
Chipper Jones had three hits , including a home run and a double , and scored three runs for Atlanta . 
&quot; I think what we read in the paper ( and ) seeing what we saw on TV about how well Pittsburgh was playing , we knew these last three ballgames we had to assert ourselves , &quot; said Jones . 
&quot; It seems like the bats woke up . 
pitching is always going to be there . 
they did an outstanding job the past three games . 
Michael Tucker had a Homer and scored twice for the braves , who scored in double figures for the fifth time this season . 
former Brave Jason Schmidt ( 1-2 ) took the loss , giving up nine runs and 10 hits in only 4 2 / 3 innings . 
Pittsburgh &apos;s Tony Womack went 2-for-3 to extend his hitting streak to 12 games and Keith Osik was 3-for-4 with two doubles and a run scored . 
in Philadelphia , Dante Bichette homered and drove in four runs as the Colorado Rockies snapped a season-high five-game losing streak with a 9-2 victory over the Phillies . 
John Burke pitched 2 2 / 3 scoreless innings of relief after coming on for starter Billy Swift in the third inning . 
Mike DeJean ( 1-0 ) then worked 3 2 / 3 perfect innings to notch his first major league win . 
&quot; That &apos;s the longest I &apos;ve ever pitched in professional baseball , &quot; said DeJean . 
&quot; When you &apos;re seven runs ahead , you &apos;ve got to throw strikes and stay aggressive . 
DeJean also collected his first career hit -- a double in the eighth -- in his first career at-bat . 
swift , who hasn &apos;t lost since April 2 , departed due to a strained right pectoral muscle . 
&quot; Swift can &apos;t throw across his body , &quot; said Rockies manager Don Baylor . 
&quot; It had subsided somewhat , but it has been lingering . 
we &apos;ll probably be putting him on the disabled list . 
Bobby Munoz ( 1-5 ) gave up six runs -- five earned -- and nine hits with no walks and two strikeouts over 2 2 / 3 innings , his shortest start of the season . 
&quot; My confidence is a little down , &quot; said Munoz . 
I have to try to get over it now and not let it carry over to my next game . 
if there &apos;s a next start , great . 
if there &apos;s not , there &apos;s not . 
&quot; Sometimes Bobby masks his emotions , &quot; said Phillies manager Terry Francona . 
&quot; So it &apos;s hard to tell how he feels . 
I hope he believes in himself because if he doesn &apos;t , then we have a problem . 
Gregg Jefferies provided Philadelphia &apos;s lone runs in the third with a two-run Homer -- his second of the year and 100th of his career . 
at Florida , Moises Alou had three hits , including a pair of doubles , and scored three times and Rob Stanifer won his first major-league decision as the Marlins defeated the Houston Astros 11-4 . 
trailing 3-1 in the fourth , the Marlins capitalised on an error by Houston second baseman Craig Biggio and rallied for five runs . 
Florida loaded the bases with one out against Astros starter Shane Reynolds ( 4-3 ) , who induced pinch-hitter Jim Eisenreich to ground into a potential inning-ending double play . 
but Biggio let the ball roll through his legs , allowing Bobby Bonilla and Jeff Conine to score . 
&quot; The ball stayed down low , &quot; said Biggio . 
that was a big play and it turned the game around . 
the Marlins improved to a major-league leading 17-5 at home . 
Stanifer ( 1-0 ) allowed a home run to Ricky Gutierrez and five hits over 2 1 / 3 innings of relief . 
he also picked up his first major-league hit in the sixth . 
Derek Bell went 3-for-4 with a Homer , triple and a single for the Astros .
