Singapore gas oil quotes in August were wide-ranging , reflective of a weak prompt market and uncertainties of buying levels , traders said on Tuesday . 
two cargoes changed hands - the first 150,000 barrels cargo for loading between August 17-21 was sold by a European major to a local trader at $ 22.85 per barrel , fob Singapore and the other for August 13-17 loading was sold by a Dutch major to western trader at $ 22.25 . 
traders said the $ 22.25 per barrel cargo traded was at unexpectedly low level . 
they said swaps quotes did not track cash quotes to that low levels and shed a mere 10 cents a barrel . 
traders also said that the deals showed that the market is still mixed of the near term price outlook . 
bullish traders cited increased demand from China with a few coastal refineries rumoured to have cut runs . 
but others said Chinese demand were absent so far as the mainland &apos;s stocks remained high . 
traders said India is still the &quot; wild card &quot; . 
&quot; If India takes in more than expected in September , prices would be supported , &quot; said one trader . 
India took only six to seven cargoes in September last year and in August it bought just 165,000 tonnes of 1.0 and 0.5 percent sulphur diesel . 
some sellers were also pinning hopes of a price rise with the extension of the 15-percent cut by Shell Singapore into August . 
the cut may helped boost levels , traders said . 
sentiment on the jet market was also weak with the lowest offer seen at $ 22.60 per barrel , down from Monday &apos;s average at around $ 23.30 . 
jet and gasoil price differencial continued to narrow with rapid falls seen in jet levels . 
the August regrade was last quoted around 30-40 cents , down from 40-60 cents .
