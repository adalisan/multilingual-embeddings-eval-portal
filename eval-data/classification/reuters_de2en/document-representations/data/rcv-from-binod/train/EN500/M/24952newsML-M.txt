a change in sentiment over the direction of U.S. interest rates dampened emerging debt prices on Friday . 
while traders and analysts say the softer tone is more due to profit-taking , some question how long Brady bonds can stay at their current high level . 
&quot; spreads ( over U.S. treasuries ) have tightened a lot in the past week . 
people are getting nervous and locking in their profits , &quot; one European bank trader said . 
trading is quiet ahead of the half day today in New York and the U.S. holiday on Monday . 
traders are waiting to see in what mood U.S. investors will return to work on Tuesday . 
after signs of a sharp rise in U.S. economic growth , the market will focus firmly on next Friday &apos;s U.S. employment figures for more clues to whether interest rates will rise . 
&quot; The market has had a good run . 
it makes you wonder if things can continue , &quot; West Merchant Bank economic adviser Peter West said . 
there has been selling in several of the major Latin American Brady bonds , including Mexico , Argentina and Venezuela . 
Argentina and Venezuela have both been hit by doubts over their economies . 
Argentina is struggling to keep its fiscal reforms intact and traders are increasingly suspicious about Venezuela &apos;s commitment to economic reform . 
but traders on the whole dismissed the latest rebellion in Mexico as a major factor , attributing the selling more to the weight on the market from weaker U.S. treasuries . 
leftist guerrillas launched surprise attacks in three Mexican states on Wednesday and Thursday , in the country &apos;s worst political violence since the Chiapas rebellion in 1994 . 
West said the uprising was a useful reminder that social problems remained acute in the country but did not change the underlying story of a recovering economy . 
Bulgarian Bradys also came under fresh pressure , partly on the decling local currency and general concern over the state of the economy . 
traders are waiting for the outcome of talks there with an International Monetary Fund mission . 
Russia is holding steady despite increasing concerns over President Boris Yelstin &apos;s health . 
a spokesman earlier said Yeltsin was doing his paperwork at a country holiday retreat but had no plans to meet any officials . 
Nigerian debt also came under some selling pressure though there was no particular fresh news out of the country .
