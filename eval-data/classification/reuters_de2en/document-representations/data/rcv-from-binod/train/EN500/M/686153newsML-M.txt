the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) , addressing concerns about the viability of its gasoline futures contract , said it will list contracts for April through July 1998 beginning next month . 
the Exchange said it will also continue to list new months on a rolling basis so that there are always at least 12 months listed . 
the April-July 1998 contracts will reflect the next phase of U.S. gasoline reformulation referred to as the complex model by the oil industry and regulators , and which must be sold in the nation &apos;s smoggiest cities from next year . 
oil industry sources have said the introduction of clean burning reformulated gasoline in 1995 spawned a backlash and regulatory uncertainty that prevented NYMEX from listing contracts far into the future , and which in turn hurt trading interest in NYMEX gasoline for well over a year .
