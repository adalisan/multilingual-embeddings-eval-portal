until a cruel midnight assault two years ago , Nurun Nahar was a pretty teenage girl , full of hope . 
but Nahar &apos;s dreams were shattered when a man broke into her house and sprayed nitric acid on her face for spurning his romantic advances . 
the jilted man was aided by four accomplices , Nahar said . 
&quot; suddenly I woke up and found myself in a hell of pain . 
everything became dark . 
my face was burning , &quot; said the 17-year-old former school student , now unemployed . 
Nahar was once envied by her friends because of her beauty . 
but the acid deformed her entire face . 
now , whenever she leaves her home , Nahar wraps herself with a sheet of white cloth . 
Nahar is not alone in her suffering . 
in a growing phenomenon , hundreds of Bangladeshi girls are becoming victims of acid attacks each year by disgruntled lovers , husbands demanding dowry and perverts who all seek to permantly disfigure their victims . 
&quot; An acid attack is the kind of violence Bangladeshi women dread most nowadays . 
this is a new form of perversion in society , &quot; said Nasreen Huq , convenor of a Dhaka-based feminist group , Naripakkho , which helps acid victims . 
doctors said attackers mainly used nitric acid , which can be obtained from chemical stores and school laboratories . 
a report by the Coordination Council Human Rights Bangladesh ( CCHRB ) , a umbrella organisation of human rights groups , listed 89 acid attacks in 1996 alone . 
&quot; There are many more incidents that are not reported in the newspapers or brought to the notice of the law , &quot; Huq said . 
&quot; It is really reaching an alarming proportion , &quot; she told Reuters . 
usually , the victims are young girls who have rebuffed male advances . 
most of 116 victims detected by Naripakkho over the past few years were aged between 11 and 20 years . 
&quot; The common cause is rejection . 
most became victims as they did not respond to romantic advances by young men , &quot; said Huq . 
&quot; attackers are sometimes dowry-hungry husbands , &quot; she added . 
according to the CCHRB report , 103 women were murdered in 1996 due to dowry-related attacks . 
Bangladesh introduced the death penalty for acid attacks several years ago to try to stamp out the practice but its application has been slow and inefficient . 
with help from Naripakkho , Nahar took her case to a court which recently handed down death sentences on two of her attackers . 
the two have appealed to a higher court and a verdict is pending . 
police said the two death sentences were the first for acid attacks . 
they said about a dozen other perpetrators had been sentenced to prison for terms of up to three years . 
human rights workers said the cases were difficult to prosecute due to a lack of evidence and because victims &apos; families were often warned by offenders of more severe consequences if they seek redress within the law . 
the killing and trafficking of women and children and forcible prostitution are also punishable by death in Bangladesh , but police and legal sources say there have been minimal convictions . 
Naripakkho started working with acid victims in 1995 . 
&quot; What we are basically providing them with is moral support . 
we are telling them that life has not ended , &quot; Huq said . 
the organisation also approaches the police on behalf of some victims , and asks hospitals to provide treatment . 
doctors at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital said treatment facilities for acid burns were scant in Bangladesh . 
Huq said her organisation had contacted plastic surgeons in foreign countries to try to arrange free treatment for victims . 
&quot; We got a positive response from Indian doctors , &quot; she said .
