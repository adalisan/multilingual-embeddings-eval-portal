Celtic &apos;s beleaguered Dutch coach Wim Jansen knows his side must beat St Johnstone in Tuesday night &apos;s League Cup clash if he is to relieve the growing crisis which threatens his job after less than seven weeks with the Scottish premier division club . 
following two opening league defeats , which leave the Glasgow club embarrassingly stranded at the bottom of the table , Jansen simply cannot contemplate losing at Perth . 
it is , however , a very real possibility . 
Newly-promoted St Johnstone have taken four points out of six to lie second in the table while Celtic are the only premier division side yet to register a point . 
the 46,000 Parkhead crowd jeered Jansen &apos;s side off the pitch on Saturday after they lost 2-1 to Dunfermline , compounding their opening-day defeat by Hibernian and a midweek loss to Austria &apos;s Innsbruck Tirol in the UEFA Cup . 
last season Celtic dropped only one point out of 24 against Dunfermline and Hibs as they finished second to Rangers . 
Celtic face St Johnstone in the league next weekend then seek to overturn the 2-1 deficit against Innsbruck on Tuesday . 
then , on September 1 comes the first Old firm clash against Rangers , who are already eyeing a record 10th consecutive league title . 
a bad set of results in those games could spell the end of Jansen &apos;s tenure and the Dutchman concedes : &quot; If we play like we did against Dunfermline it could happen every week . 
&quot; We came out at half ime 1-0 up and within a minute it was 1-1 . 
after that we lost our shape . 
it was the same story in Austria last week , we lost our way after conceding a goal . 
&quot; The players must talk to each other more . 
there is a lack of communication . 
we gave both goals to Dunfermline . 
Jansen has brought in six new players but a move to add Scottish international midfielder Paul Lambert to the squad seems certain to be killed off by Celtic &apos;s refusal to pay Borussia Dortmund &apos;s two million pounds sterling ( $ 3.2 million ) asking price . 
Lambert joined the German side as a free agent a year ago and soon became a regular in the team who went on to win the European Cup . 
last week he said he planned to stay in Germany where Dortmund have offered him an extended contract . 
there was some good news for Celtic on Monday , however , with the news that West Ham &apos;s Danish defender Marc Rieper looks set to move to Parkhead in a 1.5 million pounds ( $ 2.4 million ) transfer .
