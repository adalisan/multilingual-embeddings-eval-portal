a slump in support for the Australian government and Prime Minister John Howard has become entrenched in all states and age groups , a newspaper analysis published on Tuesday shows . 
but a special analysis of The Australian newspaper &apos;s Newspolls carried out between April and June found voters were turning to minor parties such as the controversial One Nation party rather than backing the Labor opposition . 
the analysis found primary vote support for the conservative Liberal-National coalition government in all states and age groups had fallen below levels recorded at the March 1996 election . 
&quot; The largest slumps ( in government support ) were recorded in Queensland and in the bush , and from men and people over 50 , the coalition &apos;s traditional support base , &quot; the newspaper said . 
&quot; But the opposition is not gaining from the coalition &apos;s loss with Alp ( Australian Labor Party ) support below that recorded at the 1996 election in all states except South Australia and where it has risen . 
primary vote support for the coalition fell to 43 percent in the April to June period from 47 percent at the March 1996 election -- a level the government still held in January to March . 
support for the Labor opposition dropped to 37 percent in April to June from 38.7 percent at the election and 38 percent in January and March . 
but support for minor parties surged to a total of 20 percent from 14.3 percent at the March 1996 election and 15 percent in January to March . 
the most popular of the minor parties was populist Pauline Hanson &apos;s One Nation party with six percent in the April to June period , followed by the Democrats and the Greens . 
the analysis looked at polls conducted by telephone and involving 9,180 voters during the period between April and June .
