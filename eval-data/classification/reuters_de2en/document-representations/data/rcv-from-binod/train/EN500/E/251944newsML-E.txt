for the first time ever , a plurality of Brazilians believes the anti-inflation Real Plan is a success and will continue to bear fruit , according to a survey released by the private National Industry Confederation ( CNI ) . 
the quarterly survey of 2,000 people showed 44 percent think the Real Plan is a success , up from 31 percent in this year &apos;s previous surveys . 
however , 14 percent of those interviewed thought the plan would fail and a large 39 percent said it was still too soon to pass judgement . 
four percent said they didn &apos;t know . 
low income earners are more optimistic about the Real Plan at 48 percent than higher incomer groups at 39 percent . 
a large majority of those polled , 73 percent , also said 1996 had been a good year , and an even greater number , 79 percent , was optimistic about 1997 . 
eighty percent were satisfied with their lives on the whole . 
&quot; People are systematically looking toward a better future , &quot; said CNI economist Flavio Castello Branco . 
recession and unemployment were considered to be the main threat to the Real Plan , with 17 percent of those interviewed mentioning them , followed by price rises , by 16 percent , and high interest rates by 15 percent . 
low-income earners tended to cite price rises as the main threat , whereas higher income groups thought unbridled public spending was the greatest threat .
