authorities Tuesday launched a nationwide manhunt for a former New Jersey county prosecutor who disappeared just days before he was to be sentenced on federal criminal charges . 
former Somerset County prosecutor Nicholas Bissell , who snipped his electronic monitoring bracelet and disappeared Monday , left a suicide note , but authorities doubted its validity . 
&quot; Nick Bissell won &apos;t kill himself , &quot; said a federal law enforcement agent who did not want to be identifed . 
&quot; He just wants to find a place to hide . 
U.S. Attorney Faith Hochberg vowed Bissell would be captured or turn himself in . 
&quot; He doesn &apos;t have many resources to sustain himself for a long period , and he has surrendered his passport , &quot; she said . 
Bissell had been free under home confinement on $ 300,000 bail , pending sentencing Wednesday in U.S. District Court on 30 federal charges , including fraud and tax evasion . 
Hochberg said the government was considering confiscating a Branchburg , New Jersey , condominum belonging to Bissell &apos;s mother which was used as $ 120,000 collateral for his bail . 
Bissell said she did not know where her son was . 
Hochberg defended the government &apos;s right to evict the fugitive &apos;s mother . 
&quot; It &apos;s entirely up to him , &quot; she said . 
Bissell was accused of skimming $ 146,000 from the receipts of a gasoline filling station he and his wife partly owned to support a lavish lifestyle of fancy cars , expensive jewelry and hefty credit card charges . 
Bissell also was convicted of professional corruption , misconduct and abuse of power , including ordering the destruction of a suspect &apos;s written request for an attorney , lying on ethics disclosure forms and lying to investigators . 
a jury convicted Bissell of 30 charges and his wife Barbara on 13 charges in late May . 
he was expected to face at least 10 years in prison . 
Barbara Bissell , 43 , who has filed for divorce and was living apart from her husband , also was to be sentenced Wednesday .
