an influential MP resigned from Tansu Ciller &apos;s True Path Party on Monday , the latest in a string of resignations which has sapped the party &apos;s parliamentary strength and helped the new secularist government into power . 
Dogan Gures , a career army officer who served as Turkey &apos;s chief of general staff for four years before becoming an MP in 1995 , submitted his resignation early on Monday morning , state-run Anatolian news agency said . 
Gures said in his letter of resignation , quoted by the agency , he had tried to persuade the pro-Western True Path to enter into coalition with other secularist parties and break its alliance with the Islam-based Welfare Party . 
Turkey &apos;s new secularist government won a vote of confidence on Saturday , two weeks after the collapse of a coalition between the country &apos;s first Islamist prime minister , Necmettin Erbakan , and Ciller &apos;s party . 
the number of True Path deputies has shrunk from 135 after the last election in 1995 to 97 on Monday as a result of a series of resignations and defections . 
Gures has not said if he will join another party .
