NATO freed 75 Moslem men detained for identity and security checks on Saturday , two days after Moslems resettling a village on Bosnia &apos;s internal boundary clashed with local Serb police . 
NATO blocked off Mahala , a Moslem village assigned to Serb republic territory under the Dayton treaty , and searched the men and nearby buildings for possible concealed weapons that could provoke fresh violence with the Serbs . 
NATO troops set up checkpoints on roads in and out of Mahala after one Moslem was recognised as a major in the Bosnian government army , raising questions about the real objective of military-age men arriving on Saturday . 
NATO soldiers refused comment to reporters and left after completing their search and freeing the Moslems , a Reuters reporter on the scene said . 
villagers went back to restoring war-smashed homes . 
in Sarajevo , Lieutenant Colonel Max Marriner , a spokesman for the NATO-led peace Implementation Force ( IFOR ) said his last report , two hours old , was that 50 of 75 Moslems had been checked and let go . 
he said IFOR troops took photographs of men arriving in Mahala on Saturday to build up a precautionary security file . 
Marriner said IFOR also brought the regional Bosnian government army commander into Mahala to keep him informed and have him remove known soldiers if he spotted them . 
Mahala lies in a demilitarised &quot; Zone of Separation &quot; from which uniformed local soldiers and weapons are banned . 
&quot; Everything is under control , &quot; said Marriner . 
earlier , U.N. police monitors &apos; spokesman Alex Ivanko said in Sarajevo that the spectacle of dozens of military-age Moslem men entering the hamlet together on Saturday could potentially aggravate the local Serb authorities . 
&quot; Our view is to the security of the overall situation . 
we would not wish to see any repeat of the Thursday situation in Mahala , &quot; Ivanko said . 
most Mahala residents were driven into exile early in the 1992-95 war and their homes destroyed by Serb militia . 
about 300 Moslems including women and children returned to Mahala last week to rebuild dwellings . 
fist fights and shooting broke out between Moslems and arriving Serb police on Thursday and NATO peacekeepers swept in to calm the situation . 
but when the number of Moslems filtering back into Mahala jumped considerably on Saturday , NATO went in to search them . 
we were all detained and searched -- I was searched thoroughly six times -- and they found nothing but a couple of knives , &quot; Safet Muminovic , 18 , told Reuters . 
&quot; They surrounded us and held us at gunpoint ... We weren &apos;t allowed to leave , &quot; said Senad Alic , 33 . 
NATO said Serb authorities pledged to keep their police out of Mahala on Saturday . 
five Serb police later tried to enter and were turned away by NATO troops , eyewitnesses said . 
NATO deployed several tanks and armoured personnel carriers around the village and helicopters flew overhead in what it said was more a monitoring than a protection activity .
