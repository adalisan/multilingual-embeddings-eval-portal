Frankfurt and Paris stocks clawed back losses to close at record highs on Thursday but London finished down , rattled by Wall Street &apos;s uncertain opening . 
on currency markets , the dollar was strong in late European trade , rising against the mark on weak German jobs data and hitting a new four-year high of 124 yen at one point . 
in Frankfurt , stocks recovered their poise to reach a new peak at the close as the firm dollar and interest in chemical and engineering shares enouraged a bullish mood . 
the DAX finished at 3104.14 , a modest increase on the day , but eclipsing the previous best set on Wednesday . 
&quot; With people constantly taking up chances to come into the market , I think we are O.K. 
at these levels , &quot; said another , adding that he saw 3,150 points as an attainable short-term goal for the DAX . 
the dollar -- a crucial factor for German exporters &apos; income -- was buoyed all day after a report showing a sharp rise in German unemployment , which rose to 4.66 million in January , the highest level since the 1930s . 
London , Europe &apos;s biggest bourse , was the worst performer , showing a 0.36 percent loss at the close as recent volatility on Wall Street prompted a small pull-back from Wednesday &apos;s all-time highs . 
continued fears that the Dow could be on the verge of a substantial downward correction weighed on investor sentiment but steady British and U.S. interest rates helped calm but not eradicate jittery market nerves . 
&quot; It wasn &apos;t a bad day considering Wall Street &apos;s slide yesterday , &quot; the head of trading at a large investment bank said . 
&quot; But the market is still on edge . 
the Dow Industrials , which plunged 86 points on Wednesday , started a dozen or so points firmer in the opening minutes of U.S. trade but was virtually unchanged by the close of London business . 
in Paris , shares clawed back early losses to show a 0.68 percent gain at the close . 
they had opened sharply lower following Wall Street &apos;s overnight drop . 
on the foreign exchange front , the dollar remained buoyant against the mark and yen as economic problems in Germany and Japan stayed at the forefront of traders &apos; minds , suggesting no objection to recent currency trends from the Group of Seven industrial nations this weekend . 
persistent rumours that Japan &apos;s Nippon Credit Bank is in deep financial difficulty were denied by the bank later but proved enough to help dollar to a fresh four-year high at 124.00 yen at one point . 
and the dollar hovered just shy of 31-month highs against the mark as the German currency was dented by yet another dire German jobless report . 
Seasonally-adjusted German unemployment rose a massive 160,000 in January , dragging the unadjusted unemployment rate to 12.2 percent from 10.8 percent in December . 
&quot; There &apos;s really been no change in the fundamentals that have driven the dollar this far and it &apos;s highly unlikely anyone in the G7 has an interest to reverse the trend , &quot; said Peter Wood , currency trader at Bank of Boston . 
&quot; quietly the Germans must be happy with a weaker mark when you see unemployment data like this . 
the dollar was quoted at 1.6520 marks and 123.83 yen compared with 1.6479 marks and 123.54 yen in late European trading on Wednesday . 
gold closed at $ 343.30 an ounce , compared with $ 342.95 at the close on Wednesday . 
silver finished down two cents at $ 4.83 .
