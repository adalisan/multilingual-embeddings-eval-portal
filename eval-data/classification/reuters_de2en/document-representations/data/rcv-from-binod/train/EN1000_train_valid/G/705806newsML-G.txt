Israeli troops wounded three Palestinians in clashes on Thursday in Hebron , where undercover soldiers posing as Arabs arrested young protesters in the West Bank town , witnesses said . 
hospital officials said the wounded Palestinians , hit by rubber-coated metal bullets , were not seriously hurt . 
the undercover soldiers had mingled with a morning crowd of about 50 youths in Hebron , speaking Arabic , dressing like Arabs in plain clothes , and wearing masks and keffiyeh headdresses . 
when the Palestinians began throwing stones at uniformed troops and burning an Israeli flag , the undercover men began beating and pushing them , even dragging one along the ground , while making about six arrests , witnesses said . 
the undercover troops did not open fire , they said , adding that the three wounded were shot later by uniformed soldiers . 
the protests began near the Jewish enclave of Beit Hadassah on the Israeli-held side of the West Bank town , divided since January under a peace deal with the Palestinians . 
after being surprised by the undercover soldiers , the protesters retreated to the Palestinian-held side but continued to stone troops on the Israeli side . 
the soldiers responded by firing rubber bullets while Israeli snipers armed with live ammunition deployed on roofs for a second day . 
troops on Wednesday wounded 37 youths who launched protests against the pasting of posters on Palestinian shops on Saturday desecrating Islam &apos;s Prophet Mohammad and the holy Koran . 
also on Wednesday soldiers shot dead an Arab teenager in a clash in Gaza . 
a 25-year-old Jewish woman was charged on Thursday with illegally posting the placards -- which depicted Prophet Mohammad as a pig -- on some 20 Hebron storefronts , and with endangering life by stoning an Arab car . 
the offences carry a 24-year maximum sentence . 
Israel warned the Palestinian Authority to quell the violence or risk a stronger military response . 
&quot; We can use a lot of power which we don &apos;t want to use , &quot; Israel &apos;s Hebron military commander Colonel Gadi told Reuters . 
&quot; We haven &apos;t used even five percent of our power in Hebron . 
defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on Thursday met U.S. 
Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk and Egypt &apos;s envoy Mohammad Bassiouny to discuss the Hebron violence and the hobbled Israeli-PLO peace process . 
&quot; In the three-way meeting the defence minister made clear to the two ambassadors the security establishment &apos;s position that the Palestinian Authority is under the obligation to deal with the rioting in Hebron with an iron fist , &quot; Mordechai &apos;s office said in a statement . 
Israeli troops have clashed with Palestinians routinely since Israel began work on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem last March , plunging peacemaking into crisis .
