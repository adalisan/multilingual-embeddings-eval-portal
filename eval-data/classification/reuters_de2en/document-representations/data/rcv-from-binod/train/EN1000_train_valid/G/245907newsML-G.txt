protesters rallying in Belgrade on Tuesday vowed to continue a wave of demonstrations despite a Federal Supreme Court ruling that failed to confirm the opposition &apos;s local election victories . 
the Supreme Court ruled it had no jurisdiction over the municipal election dispute , effectively closing the last legal option for the opposition which insists it fairly won control of Belgrade and other cities in polling last month . 
the opposition coalition Zajedno had maintained a faint hope the courts would back down in the face of intense pressure , and overturn what was widely seen as electoral fraud by the ruling Socialist Party . 
some opposition supporters had shared that hope , believing President Slobodan Milosevic would use it as a way out of the crisis that has sparked the most sustained challenge to his rule since he came to power nine years ago . 
&quot; I realy thought Milosevic would instruct the court to accept the appeal , but since that failed we will simply have to keep coming out until something changes . 
&quot; And things have to change , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Why else would I stand out here in the freezing cold every day . 
after 23 days of marches through some of Serbia &apos;s main cities including the capital , defiant opposition supporters said it would take more than a corrupt judicial system to deflect them from their campaign . 
&quot; The opposition won the elections legaly -- we all know that , &quot; said Vesna , 42 , as she listened to the speeches in Belgrade &apos;s Terazija square . 
&quot; That &apos;s why we are here and why we will keep coming until justice wins . 
a person has to believe in justice and democracy or they might as well die on the spot . 
others argued that pressure on the state could still overturn the court rulings . 
&quot; It all depends on how much pressure comes from the street , &quot; said taxi driver Dragomir . 
&quot; With enough of us demanding justice , even the Supreme Court can see sense and change its mind . 
&quot; Here the law is controlled by humans , and it can be changed . 
push the people hard enough and I think even someone like Milosevic will bend , &quot; said shop assistant Dejan . 
he said the growing international condemnation of Milosevic and his tactics could tip the scales in the opposition &apos;s favour . 
aware of the motivating influence of international attention on the demonstrators , Zajedno ended Tuesday &apos;s march by projecting Western news reports about the protests onto a huge screen above the crowd . 
&quot; The U.S. , Germany , Europe -- they must all keep up the pressure and for a long period . 
then Milosevic must give in , &quot; said another shop assistant , Olga . 
&quot; He doesn &apos;t care about us , but he does care what the other big countries think . 
some protesters said the time was ripe for the trade unions , the bedrock of Socialist power , to join the campaign and bring the country to a standstill with strikes . 
&quot; The workers must now strike . 
they must see how corrupt this regime is and how there is no longer any point in backing him , &quot; said a pensioner who declined to be named . 
&quot; It is an old communist belief that if the workers protest , you are finished .
