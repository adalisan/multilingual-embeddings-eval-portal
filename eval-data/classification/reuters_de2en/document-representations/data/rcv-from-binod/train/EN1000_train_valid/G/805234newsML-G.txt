international police say they are investigating allegations that Bosnian Serb nationalist hardliners intimidated court judges and conducted widespread telephone tapping in their power struggle against President Biljana Plavsic . 
the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) said it was sifting through &quot; bags of evidence &quot; taken from a police station in the northwestern town of Banja Luka in Bosnia &apos;s Serb territory . 
&quot; We have collected a sizable quantity of evidence that is now being compiled and recorded , &quot; IPTF spokesman Alun Roberts said late on Monday in Banja Luka . 
special police loyal to Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic seized control of the police station before dawn on Sunday because they said the building had been used by rival police to bug the president &apos;s telephones and faxes . 
the NATO-led peace force sent in British troops later on Sunday to prevent a possible clash between Plavsic &apos;s supporters and police forces loyal to government hardliners . 
NATO also said it deployed the British soldiers to secure the building to allow international police to investigate possible &quot; human rights violations &quot; . 
while British troops stood guard , IPTF monitors spent Sunday and Monday interviewing policemen and searching the five-floor building for evidence . 
Western officials , who asked not to be named , said IPTF monitors found numerous tapes and transcripts which were part of an elaborate eavesdropping operation by hardliners loyal to ex-president and indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic . 
Plavsic has been locked in a power struggle with Karadzic loyalists , accusing them of rampant corruption and of damaging Serb interests by blocking the peace process . 
she alleged on Monday that her government opponents were tapping dozens of officials and prominent figures in Banja Luka , including two judges on the constitutional court . 
independent Serb media reported that one of the judges , Jovo Rosic , was badly beaten last week because he had refused to bow to pressure to strike down Plavsic &apos;s decision last month to dissolve parliament and call early elections . 
the office of the High Representative to Bosnia , Carlos Westendorp , said it was deeply concerned about reports that judges had been intimidated and said it was closely following the investigation into possible wiretapping . 
in Washington , the United States said on Monday it rejected the Bosnian Serb constitutional court &apos;s ruling that Plavsic could not call early elections . 
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin , in the first official U.S. comment since the court made its ruling , said : &quot; We reject the decision of the court . 
&quot; Her ( Plavsic &apos;s ) action was clearly legal and ... the constitutional court was subjected to intimidation and politicisation . 
the Bosnian Serb cabinet , loyal to Karadzic , accused Plavsic of being a pawn of foreign enemies who were allegedly plotting to divide the Serb nation . 
in a statement issued on Monday through the official television network , the government said that the Interior Ministry had informed NATO that it was prepared to deploy special units to remove Plavsic &apos;s police from the Banja Luka station . 
British troops withdrew from the police station late on Monday afternoon after international police finished gathering evidence . 
Iit remained unclear who was in control of the station . 
although NATO said Plavsic &apos;s special police withdrew from the building on Sunday night , Western officials said Plavsic had appointed new civilian officers to run the disputed police station .
