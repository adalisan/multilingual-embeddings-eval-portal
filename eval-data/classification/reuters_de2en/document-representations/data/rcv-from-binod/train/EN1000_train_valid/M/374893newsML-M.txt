IPE gas oil futures closed $ 4.50 weaker on Thursday after finding comfortable support and trading in a well-defined range around $ 180 a tonne , traders said . 
Front-month March last traded at $ 180.25 a tonne after weaker early NYMEX futures and erratic IPE Brent helped move it down from the $ 181 to $ 182 range . 
&quot; Gas oil just consolidated at a lower level in reasonable volume , nothing special . 
Brent saw the real action today , &quot; a trader said . 
the contract found solid support at $ 178.50 and traders saw resistance at around $ 185.25 . 
prompt March Brent , which expires at the close , was narrowly firmer in choppy afternoon trade as supportive technical factors held ground against bearish fundamentals , dealers said . 
Brent was trading at $ 20.55 a barrel at 1805 GMT , up three cents , after see-sawing throughout the afternoon and plunging to a new session low of $ 20.30 . 
the more actively traded April Brent was two cents lower at $ 20.22 . 
&quot; It &apos;s pretty nervous today . 
people aren &apos;t sure about which way it &apos;s going to go next , &quot; said a broker .
