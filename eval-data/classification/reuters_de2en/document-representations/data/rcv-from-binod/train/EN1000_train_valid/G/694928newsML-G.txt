the leaders of Britain and China are to hold their first summit meeting just hours before the Hong Kong handover on Monday night , and China will be told to keep its promises on Hong Kong &apos;s freedoms . 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook will meet China &apos;s President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng for one hour of talks at a harbourfront hotel , British officials said . 
President Jiang is to have a 10-minute meeting with heir to the British throne Prince Charles half an hour before the prince hands Hong Kong back at a lavish handover ceremony . 
the summit will take place at the Harbour Plaza View Hotel on the Kowloon peninsula , a short boat trip across the harbour from the venue of the midnight ( 1600 GMT ) handover ceremony . 
tight security was thrown up on Sunday around the hotel , expected to serve as a base for visiting Chinese leaders . 
it will be Blair &apos;s first meeting with Jiang . 
it will also be the first meeting between British and Chinese leaders since Blair &apos;s Labour Party came to power on May 1 , sweeping out the long-ruling Conservatives who signed the handover treaty with China 13 years ago . 
speaking in a radio interview Cook said Blair and he would focus mainly on Hong Kong during the summit meeting . 
&quot; Hong Kong will be the main centrepiece of our relations with China for a long time to come , &quot; Cook said . 
he said Britain expected China to keep to its bargain in the 1984 Joint Declaration , and he reminded China this is a full- blown international treaty registered at the United Nations . 
&quot; In particular we expect them to keep to the promise that they have made that they will restore free and fair elections within 12 months for a new democratic Legislative Council , &quot; Cook said . 
China is disbanding Hong Kong &apos;s elected legislature and rolling back some key political freedoms in Hong Kong to reverse political reforms it says were introduced without its consent in the twilight years of British rule . 
it plans to install an appointed provisional legislature on Tuesday until new elections are held -- under new election rules that are still to be announced . 
the new government will also , at China &apos;s behest , introduce laws curbing freedom of association and assembly , and it plans to make activities that &quot; endanger national security &quot; a crime . 
the watering down of Hong Kong &apos;s civil rights and democracy is fiercely opposed by Britain and by Hong Kong &apos;s home-grown democracy movement , which won 70 percent of the directly elected seats in the legislature in elections held two years ago . 
British officials also said they believed Hong Kong &apos;s leader-to-be Tung Chee-hwa might not go to a British sunset farewell ceremony at the East Tamar military base on Monday , even though he had accepted the invitation , because of the likely simultaneous arrival of the Chinese leadership . 
speculation has been rife Tung would not attend , and some sources see it as a snub to the departing colonial power . 
but a British official said : &quot; It has never been anticipated the Chinese Government would send representatives to this event . 
Charles , Blair , Cook and Governor Chris Patten will all attend the farewell parade on the Hong Kong waterfront . 
the British spokesman also said Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen would bid China &apos;s official farewell to Charles and Patten at the Hong Kong Convention Centre 15 minutes after the midnight flag change . 
they would be escorted to to the royal yacht Britannia by a Chinese vice foreign minister and would sail out of Hong Kong . 
Blair would leave separately by air one hour after midnight .
