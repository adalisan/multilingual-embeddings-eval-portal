a spate of Colombian Cusiana spot sales in the U.S. Gulf have set a new lower price level for the coveted sweet grade , traders said on Tuesday . 
an equity producer sold a cargo loading September 13-17 to a U.S. refiner at around October West Texas Intermediate / Cushing minus $ 1.05 a barrel . 
Colombian state oil company Ecopetrol sold another cargo loading September 21-25 to another U.S. refiner at close to $ 1.10 under the benchmark , traders said . 
two other deals , apparently consummated on Monday , confirmed the weaker price range . 
an equity producer sold a mid-September loader of Cusiana , again at close to $ 1.10 under October WTI . 
Ecopetrol also sold a September 17-21 cargo at October WTI minus $ 1.10 a barrel , traders said . 
five cargoes from the September program of 15 shipments have yet to be sold . 
others that were sold to refiners are being re-offered into the market . 
the minus $ 1.05-1.10 price range for Cusiana contrasts sharply with the late-July level of minus 55-65 cents a barrel . 
traders said the market was adjusting the increase in the number of Cusiana cargoes from an average of seven per month in June to 15 in September . 
elsewhere in Latin America , most if not all of the Venezuelan Mesa and Ecuadoran Oriente crudes have been sold for September , spurring initial talk of October barrels , traders said . 
Oriente , for example , was talked at November WTI minus $ 3.05 a barrel delivered into the Gulf . 
Brent talk was subdued . 
in two deals in London , dated Brent was sold at September Brent minus 15 cents and minus 20 cents , both loading in the last decade of August . 
notionally , the price for Brent delivered into the Gulf was pegged at WTI minus five cents to flat , compared to around minus 30 cents late last week .
