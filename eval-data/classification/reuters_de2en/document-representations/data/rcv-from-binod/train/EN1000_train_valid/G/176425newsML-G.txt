Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has called for proper recognition of his constitutional rights to punish corrupt officials , state-controlled media reported on Friday . 
&quot; If it is possible , first ... please allow prime ministers to have full power in fighting against corruption ... &quot; the Lao Dong newspaper quoted him as telling National Assembly delegates in a speech . 
the Communist Party daily Nhan Dan said Kiet had argued that , under law , the prime minister may accuse , warn , dismiss , sack or propose legal action against officials he had appointed who were suspected of graft . 
he did not make it clear whether he was referring to specific individuals . 
corruption , endemic in Vietnam , has become a burning political issue in recent months and the domestic media has given unprecedented coverage to serious graft cases . 
several political figures , most notably Communist Party Secretary General Do Muoi , and National Assembly delegates have grabbed headlines recently with rousing speeches calling for a blitz on corruption . 
Kiet , one of a leadership triumvirate with Muoi and President Le Duc Anh , had until now kept a relatively low profile on the issue . 
dubbing graft the &quot; national enemy &quot; , Kiet asked the National Assembly &apos;s Standing Committee to supervise government work in battling corruption and smuggling . 
justice Minister Nguyen Dinh Loc was quoted by official media earlier this week as saying proposed changes to the criminal law would define bribery and set out punishments , including the use of the death penalty . 
he said the Justice Ministry had been appointed to examine a beefing up of the police and justice system or the setting up of a nationwide anti-corruption committee . 
earlier this year , a Hong Kong-based consultancy survey named China , Indonesia and Vietnam as the most graft-ridden countries in Asia .
