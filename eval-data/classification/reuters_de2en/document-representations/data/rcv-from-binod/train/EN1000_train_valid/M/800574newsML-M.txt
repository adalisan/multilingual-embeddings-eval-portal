&quot; The market &apos;s reaction was a bit disappointing , &quot; one COMEX dealer said . 
&quot; The inflation data was pretty good but pretty much as expected to stocks and bonds did little as did gold , and there &apos;s not much paper in the ring , &quot; he said . 
but traders remain wary of a further correction of the stock market which may result in December gold testing the top of its $ 320-335 range of the past month . 
so far the S &amp; P500 index has declined 4.4 PCT by Wednesday &apos;s close from the all time high on August 7 . 
ironically , August 14 marks the 60th anniversary of the 1937 high in the stock market which was followed , not by a crash like 1929 or 1937 , but by a steady 42 PCT decline in a little over two months , analysts noted . 
COMEX December gold was down 30 cents at $ 330.40 an ounce after the first half hour of trade , after dipping to an early session low at $ 329.50 . 
minor support is still seen around $ 328.00 , with major resistance around $ 335.00 . 
in the bullion market , spot gold was quoted $ 326.20 / 70 an ounce early , compared to the London Thursday morning fix at $ 327.30 and the New York close Wednesday around $ 326.90 / 40 . 
on a bearish note , implied gold lease rates rose sharply again Thursday , to 2.68 PCT for one month from 2.29 PCT Wednesday , and to 2.37 percent for one year from 2.26 PCT . 
the move suggested funds and producers may be borrowing again to fund short positions and hedges , as spot gold is back near the top of its range of the past month around $ 330.00 . 
COMEX September silver was off 0.2 cent at $ 4.50 an ounce , after a 8.2 cent gain Wednesday to test the high of the past month around $ 4.540 . 
earlier TOCOM platinum and palladium prices slipped overnight on reports of Russian sales of platinum group metals in the spot market in Europe . 
but one month platinum lease rates were unchanged around 20 PCT , as were one month palladium lease rates which were indicated around 80 PCT . 
&quot; The Russian may be exporting a little again , but inventories are not rebuilding , as the metal is either delivered against a TOCOM short position or consumed by manufactures or possible even hoarded , &quot; one U.S. refining source said .
