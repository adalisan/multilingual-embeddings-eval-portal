heavy commercial demand for the U.S. dollar on Tuesday triggered greenback buying and sank the Taiwan dollar to a new eight-year low close for the second consecutive day , dealers said . 
Tuesday &apos;s closing marked the lowest level since a T $ 28.03 finish on January 7 , 1989 . 
the Taiwan dollar was slowly testing its downside , they said , due to importers &apos; quarter-end U.S. dollar demand and strong expectations that the local unit would slip after the central bank on Monday abandoned its defence at T $ 27.90 . 
&quot; The Taiwan dollar is definitely in a downtrend , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; You can tell the central bank is quietly smoothing the Taiwan dollar &apos;s fall , but its action is not that aggressive . 
&quot; Had the central bank not intervened , the Taiwan dollar soon would have fallen to T $ 28 , &quot; he added . 
some dealers said they suspected the central bank may orchestrate &quot; political intervention &quot; to bolster the currency ahead of Hong Kong &apos;s July 1 handover by Britain to China , a sensitive issue for Taiwan as it is seen by Beijing as a wayward province that also must be &quot; reunified with the motherland &quot; . 
market factors could give the central bank some cover . 
&quot; seasonal U.S. dollar demand should gradually fade by the end of June , &quot; the dealer said . 
&quot; At that time , the central bank may try to support the Taiwan dollar , giving other people a good impression about Taiwan &apos;s financial stability . 
a June depreciation was in line with the average forecast of six senior Taipei dealers in an informal May 30 Reuters poll . 
four of the dealers said Taiwan &apos;s easing dollar would break eight-year support at T $ 28 in the third quarter , citing slack economic growth and political uncertainties -- but not before the central bank put up a strong defence to slow the slide . 
two dissenting dealers acknowledged the depreciation pressure , but said the central bank would mount a defence of such vigour that the currency would remain above T $ 28 .
