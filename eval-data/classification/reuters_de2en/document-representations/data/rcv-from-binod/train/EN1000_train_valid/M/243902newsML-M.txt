the 30-share Bombay Stock Exchane ( BSE ) index fell 12.04 points to a provisional 2,814.16 . 
brokers said Life Insurance Corporation ( LIC ) was the lone buyer among domestic financial institutions . 
brokers said foreign institutioanl investors ( FIIs ) were barely present in the market because of their low year-end commitments and approaching Christmas holidays . 
&quot; No one wants to keep his positions long at this time of the year , especially in speculative shares , &quot; said another broker . 
stock broker Sunil Kothari said domestic financial institutions had been inactive in the market for want of funds . 
&quot; Blue chip prices have down drastically . 
it &apos;s time to buy . 
but who has got money to buy , except FIIs , &quot; Kothari said . 
&quot; And I don &apos;t think FIIs will come into the picture before January . 
brokers said they were sceptical about the outcome , from a proposed meeting the market watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has called in New Delhi on Tuesday to discuss measures to help shares recover . 
&quot; Not much is expected of the SEBI meeting , &quot; said a broker . 
&quot; There could be some relaxation in procedures , rules governing bad deliveries , etc . 
but nothing else . 
Kothari said double txation on dividends , a proper check on new issues to ensure circulation of funds in the market and other matters of serious concern would need attention . 
&quot; They are only promising but not implementing , &quot; he said . 
Kothari said the market would be dull all through December but state-owned domestic institutions would step in to support the BSE index at 2,800 should it fall to that level .
