Slovenia &apos;s SBI index surged 6.19 percent on Tuesday as foreign investors returned en masse , encouraged by the Bank of Slovenia &apos;s relaxation of investment rules . 
&quot; The Bank of Slovenia decided to enable foreigners to trade freely except in cases when selling shares to domestic investors . 
as a consequence the index could jump to 1,550 points by the end of July , &quot; an analyst said . 
the central bank said on Tuesday expensive balancing of money paid into fiduciary acounts , which international portfolio investors must hold in order to trade in securities , would not be necessary when foreigners trade among themselves or when shares are held for at least seven years . 
traders said drug makers Lek and Krka , petrol trader Petrol , health resort Terme Catez and food maker Droga were likely to attract most foreign interest in the next couple of weeks . 
petrol trader Petrol was the most active , up 7.84 percent to 18,980 tolars on volume of 1,836 shares . 
health resort Terme Catez was the biggest gainer , up 9.9 percent to 12,650 tolars on volume of 1,585 shares . 
overall 17 shares rose , three fell , one was unchanged and six were untraded . 
turnover jumped to 184.1 million tolars from 110.9 million . 
brokerage Dadas was the leading decliner , down 9.09 percent to 7,000 tolars on volume of 51 shares . 
traders attributed the fall to poor liquidity of the share . 
Lek jumped 6.59 percent to 26,700 , while Droga was up 4.9 percent to 30,000 tolars . 
Krka , which is listed on the over-the-counter ( OTC ) market of the Ljubljana bourse , surged 14.4 percent to 19,790 .
