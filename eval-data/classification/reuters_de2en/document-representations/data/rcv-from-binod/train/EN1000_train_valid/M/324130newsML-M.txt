&quot; There are no reasons for firm prices anywhere in Europe , &quot; one German trader said . 
and , despite speculation over new sales to Iraq , French export sheets still have plenty of blanks and wheat was having a tough time holding on to the week &apos;s shallow gains . 
French wheat markets did respond positively to a larger-than-expected European Union export award , posting slight gains over the week at main ports . 
brokers said wheat was under pressure on Wednesday , drifting off about five francs from the previous day but up two or three francs a tonne from the previous week for nearby delivery . 
any confirmation that Iraq has bought up to 325,000 tonnes of French wheat in its U.N. oil-for-food swap might push the market higher , but shippers are wary of the complications involved in the strictly monitored deal . 
barley at last showed signs of ticking into life at northern Dunkirk , indicating that traders may be moving cautiously to cover recent EU barley sales to Saudi Arabia , dealers said . 
but prices had yet to respond n any significant way and local traders were looking for bids at the next EU export tender on Thursday to set the lead . 
so far shippers have held back from getting the necessary barley export licences to cover the large Saudi trade . 
in maize the spotlight was on deliveries from southwestern France to Spain at competitive prices as markets awaited the starting date for the next batch of preferential maize imports to Spain from the United States . 
the departure of trucks to Spain was seen cutting into the supply of maize to southwestern ports though prices there eased slightly over the week . 
German wheat prices are drifting lower as the export market fails to take off , brokers said on Wednesday . 
uncertainty about Polish plans to restore customs duties on grains , which would weaken Germany &apos;s supply opportunities , also weighed on sentiment . 
Poland is the most obvious outlet for German wheat . 
feed wheat demand was reasonably high but attempts to raise domestic prices by citing high sterling-induced prices for competing British supply were unsuccessful . 
barley and rye prices were broadly steady . 
feed barley benefited from firm prices for competing imported protein feeds , but ample supply and expectations barley will be sold into intervention offset possible gains . 
the UK market is on its way down on sentiment that exports are not as brisk as they need to be , traders said . 
&quot; We may struggle to shift everything , &quot; one said . 
the UK has lost out on the German market and although there is talk of demand from Spain and Portugal , it involves no more than small shipments , he said . 
&quot; When Tilbury , Immingham and Teesport are loading coasters , you can see how bad the market is , &quot; he said . 
despite reports of increased farmer selling , there are still complaints that there is too little spot grain around . 
&quot; It &apos;s very difficult to buy spot , &quot; another said . 
and another saw Tuesday &apos;s green rate change bringing prices down , because of the psychological effect on farmer thinking . 
even though the sterling value of the intervention price should make no difference , it might encourage some farmers to bring grain to market and accept lower prices , she said . 
in Spain , widespread heavy rain has been delaying both maize harvesting in the north and wheat-sowing in the south , contributing to a pick-up in prices , dealers said . 
durum wheat has also been subject to strong demand from Italy and northern Europe , hence a sharp price rise . 
&quot; With the market so tight and the problems with the weather I don &apos;t think its going to do us any good . 
it needs to stop raining , &quot; said one trader . 
Italian durum wheat prices fell slightly despite an small increase in demand as millers were more eager to refurbish their warehouses for the next months .
