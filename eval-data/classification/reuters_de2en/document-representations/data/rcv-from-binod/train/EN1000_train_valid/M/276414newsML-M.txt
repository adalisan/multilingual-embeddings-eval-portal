the Federal Reserve added reserves to the banking system via four- and 13-day fixed system repurchase agreements Thursday , the New York Fed said . 
the dual tranche was not a surprise , given the large add need over the next couple of weeks , analysts said . 
the operation came an hour earlier than its usual 1130 est / 1630 GMT intervention period , even though federal funds traded only slightly above target at 5-5 / 16 percent .
