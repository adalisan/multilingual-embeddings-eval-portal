reigning world rally champion Tommi Makinen of Finland heads into Monday &apos;s Catalunya Rally , the fifth round of the championship , locked in a thrilling three-way battle with Briton Colin McRae and Spaniard Carlos Sainz . 
Makinen , who drives for Mitsubishi , took the lead with a victory in Portugal three weeks ago and is confident his car will be well-suited to the asphalt stages after recent testing . 
&quot; I think we can do very well in this event , because the surface is very similar to the Portuguese Rally , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I like the roads here a lot and our car performs very well on tarmac . 
for McRae , who lies five points behind Makinen in the championship table , the event is likely to prove crucial to his hopes of winning the title . 
he won the rally last year after a thrilling fight with Subaru team-mate , Italian Piero Liatti , who returns to the outfit for this event . 
&quot; Last year was a tough but satisfying victory , &quot; said McRae , the 1995 world champion . 
&quot; It was one of the most unbelievable battles I have ever been involved in and I &apos;m sure Piero will be keen to settle the score after being so close last year . 
Liatti is an acknowledged tarmac specialist and is regarded by many to be the firm favourite for victory on this event . 
after his win on the season opening Monte Carlo Rally it could also see him take a surprise lead in the world championship . 
&quot; We have had a very encouraging test before this event and I am confident the set-up we used in Catalunya last year will be hard to beat , &quot; he said . 
the home fans , however , will expect nothing less than a victory for national hero Sainz in the Ford , who crashed out of last November &apos;s event on the second stage . 
&quot; The support we get is fantastic and competing in my home country is always a great occasion , &quot; said the winner of the 1992 and 1995 rallies . 
&quot; In 1996 we were unlucky to roll the Ford when challenging for the lead . 
now we have a great chance to make amends . 
the rally has established itself as one of the most popular and demanding events on the calendar since it joined the world championship in 1991 . 
this year &apos;s event , which starts on Monday , is based in the Mediterranean resort of Lloret del Mar , situated between the Pyrenees and Barcelona . 
the 1,359-kilometre route takes the teams north of the base for the first and final days , with the second leg making use of the fast roads around Prades and Escaladei to the south west .
