Italy &apos;s economy in 1997 will grow at a slower pace than expected with no signs of an upturn until the second half of the year , economists said . 
a Reuter quarterly poll of 18 analysts showed average forecasts for real gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth of 1.2 percent against an estimate three months ago of 1.5 percent . 
the government &apos;s official GDP growth target for 1997 is 2.0 percent following an expected 0.8 percent rise in 1996 . 
but on January 15 Labour Minister Tiziano Treu said GDP this year was seen growing between 1.2 and 1.5 percent . 
&quot; I expect this year to be a year of recovery even if it won &apos;t be sparkling , &quot; he said without elaborating . 
Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio has been even more pessimistic , saying : &quot; Economic growth in 1997 will not be far from the unsatisfactory figure seen in 1996 . 
latest official figures put third quarter 1996 annual growth at 0.7 percent . 
analysts polled said still depressed levels of private and public consumer demand would brake economic growth , while investment was seen increasing , although only modestly . 
Italy &apos;s foreign trade balance was seen making a positive contribution with exports continuing to increase more than imports rise , while stocks after a strong drawdown last year would be built up again gradually . 
&quot; The cycle will be influenced by the European economic trend and in particular by the speed of the German locomotive , &quot; said Alfredo Granata , analyst at Banca di Roma . 
all the economists surveyed said a boost to the economy from domestic demand would remain limited , leading to less growth in Italy &apos;s GDP than the European average . 
&quot; The one-off eurotax this year will eat into disposable income and this will result in even less consumer demand , &quot; said Paolo Casadio , analyst at Credito Italiano . 
the Milan bank saw private consumer demand growing only 0.8 percent this year with public sector demand falling 0.3 percent . 
Bank of America and DRI forecast private consumer demand growing 0.7 percent while Banca di Roma saw a 0.9 percent rise . 
&quot; Consumer confidence should improve , partly because taxpayers have had several months now to get grumbles over the eurotax off their chests , &quot; said Banca di Roma &apos;s Granata . 
the unpopular 12.5 trillion lire eurotax , including a one-off 5.5 trillion levy on incomes , is one of the main planks of the 1997 budget aimed at keeping alive hopes of early membership of the single European currency . 
analysts &apos; forecasts of investment levels varied . 
&quot; In 1997 company profits will be in line with 1996 . 
the brake on investment growth will come from high real interest rates , &quot; said Ottavio Ricchi of DRI who saw investments growing 3.1 percent against 1.6 percent in 1996 . 
Bank of America economist Bruno Rovelli said investments would be limited by &quot; a continuing stagnating economy but also by bank rates which are not yet in line with market rates . 
Casadio underlined the financing difficulties faced by small-to-medium-sized companies and noted 1996 profits were less than in past years . 
Credito Italiano did not expect investment growth to exceed 2.4 percent . 
forecasts were generally for healthy export growth . 
&quot; Italian firms are very competitive , &quot; said Rovelli who saw 1997 exports growing 6.5 percent .
