French Prime Minister Alain Juppe voiced horror on Thursday at Algeria &apos;s civil war but reiterated that Paris would not intervene in the former French colony . 
&quot; We are agreed on a feeling of horror in the face of so much barbarity and on expressing our sympathy to the Algerian people because they suffer in their flesh , in their culture and in their spirit , &quot; Juppe said during Senate questions . 
but he immediately added that &quot; Algeria &apos;s fate is not decided in Paris . 
perhaps we should break with habits which belong to the past . 
the only party that France stood by , Juppe said , was the party of democracy . 
elections should be as transparent and as unquestionable as possible , he added . 
&quot; We mustn &apos;t leave the Algerian people isolated , because that would add other difficulties , including economic ones , to the tragedy they are living . 
&quot; To go beyond that , to get involved in the choice of those who must participate in these elections , would mean confusing our moral responsibility with interference which is no longer on the agenda , &quot; Juppe said . 
in an implicit reference to French ex-president Valery Giscard d &apos;Estaing &apos;s call last week for Islamists to be allowed to take part in forthcoming Algerian general elections , Juppe said he did not want to step into a row on the issue . 
Juppe had said on Monday that Algeria &apos;s proposed parliamentary elections should be open to all legal parties , effectively ruling out the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) . 
Socialist opposition leader Lionel Jospin has urged France to consult its European partners on a joint initiative on Algeria . 
Jospin said no one dared to discuss the conflict while Paris stayed silent about Algeria , which won independence from France in 1962 after a bloody war . 
an estimated 60,000 people have died in Algeria in fighting since military-backed authorities cancelled a general election in January 1992 which the FIS was poised to win . 
Paris is especially attuned to events across the Mediterranean because of the presence in France of more than two million people of Algerian origin . 
Algerian-based Islamic fundamentalist groups claimed responsibilty for several bloody bombings in France in 1995 and authorities suspect them of a similar attack in Paris in December which killed four people .
