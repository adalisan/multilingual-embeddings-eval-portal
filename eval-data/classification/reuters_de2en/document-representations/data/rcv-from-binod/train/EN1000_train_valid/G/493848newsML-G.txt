Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on his return from the White House on Tuesday faltering Middle East peace could be salvaged . 
but he insisted Palestinian President Yasser Arafat crackdown on Palestinian militants before any U.S-mediated solution could be implemented . 
&quot; I believe there is a way to move forward , &quot; Netanyahu told foreign reporters on his return from meeting U.S. President Bill Clinton . 
Netanyahu declined to reveal details of his talks which Clinton called &quot; frank and candid &quot; , diplomatic language for difficult . 
Netanyahu said he had put forward ideas to break the political deadlock and end Palestinian street protests that have been raging since he ordered the building of a Jewish settlement on the outskirts of Jerusalem three weeks ago . 
Western sources said Clinton had proposed a package of Israeli measures which would accompany an Arafat clampdown on Islamic opponents of Israeli-PLO peace who have resumed suicide attacks on Israelis . 
this would include a freeze on Jewish settlements , an easing of restrictions on Palestinian travel , the opening of a crossing between the West Bank and Gaza , and the development of an airport and seaport in Gaza , the sources said . 
Netanyahu sidestepped questions about the package but he said ideas were being considered . 
&quot; I intend to do everything to ensure the peace process suceeds , &quot; he said . 
he insisted , however , that he would go ahead with the settlement between Jerusalem and Bethlehem which has plunged Arab-Israeli relations to their lowest point since the landmark 1993 peace deal with Arafat . 
Netanyahu was speaking after Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers shot dead three Palestinians and wounded 103 in unrest in the West Bank city of Hebron . 
&quot; The first thing is that we want to check what actually happened there , &quot; he said of the killings . 
&quot; meantime what is required is very close cooperation between the security forces of Israel and the Palestinian Authority to control the situation and exercise restraint and restore confidence . 
he set an Arafat crackdown on terrorism as a pre-condition for political progress . 
&quot; We don &apos;t expect a hundred percent results , ( but ) we expect a hundred percent effort on the part of our Palestinian partners to stop this terrorism . 
he dismissed charges that his settlement policy had provoked the current crisis . 
he said that unlike some politicians he did not lurch from euphoria to depression in working for peace . 
he said he believed a negotiated settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict was possible , including thorny issues like settlements and the status of Jerusalem . 
&quot; I think it is possible to resolve them contrary to all expection , &quot; he added .
