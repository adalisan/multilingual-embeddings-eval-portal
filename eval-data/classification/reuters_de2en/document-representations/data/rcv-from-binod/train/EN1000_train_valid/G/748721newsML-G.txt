military ruler Pierre Buyoya has said parties to Burundi &apos;s crisis will meet for negotiations in Tanzania in August and he hoped all Hutu armed factions would attend . 
Buyoya , a retired army major who seized power in a coup on July 25 last year , told reporters on Tuesday night negotiations would start in August in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha . 
&quot; I &apos;m going to be present with the political parties and hopefully all the armed factions as well , &quot; said Buyoya , but he added that some parties had certain conditions for attending . 
he said talks would be chaired by African elder statesman Julius Nyerere , a former Tanzanian president and the international mediator trying to end Burundi &apos;s civil war and political crisis . 
Buyoya said his government had opened secret talks with the National Council for the Defence of Democracy ( CNDD ) , the political wing of the largest Hutu rebel movement , and in March in Rome they signed an agreement for the basis of negotiations . 
Buyoya dismissed as inaccurate a report last week from the London-based human rights group Amnesty International that Burundi &apos;s mainly Tutsi army had forced majority Hutu civilians into &quot; regroupment &quot; camps , leading to massacres of hundreds . 
&quot; People were regrouped because of security and only because of security . 
this is only a temporary solution ... When I read the Amnesty report I got the impression the whole country had been regrouped , &quot; Buyoya said . 
Amnesty said estimates of the number of people confined to regroupment camps in Burundi were between 350,000 and 500,000 . 
more than 150,000 people have been killed in massacres and civil war pitting the Tutsi-dominated army against Hutu rebels since the killing of Burundi &apos;s first Hutu president in 1993 .
