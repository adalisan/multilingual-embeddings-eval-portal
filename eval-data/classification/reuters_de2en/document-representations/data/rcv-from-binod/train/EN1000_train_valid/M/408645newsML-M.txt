grain exporters stepped up the pressure for European Union wheat export licences on Thursday and the result could be a drop of at least three Ecus per tonne in refunds awarded at a weekly tender , grain traders said . 
traders kept up the same volume of bids as last week , with applications for 942,500 tonnes through France and minor volumes sought after elsewhere . 
but the value of French bids fell to 11.79-17.74 Ecus per tonne from the previous week &apos;s 15.67-21.47 Ecus despite a firmer domestic market and other fundamentals that had hardly changed . 
&quot; These are very aggressive bids , &quot; said one trader , noting that licences booked this week would carry an extra monthly premium of 1.1 Ecus compared to those obtained next week . 
just how aggressive the bidding was became clear as traders sifted through the breakdown of key French bids . 
traders said the lowest refund bid of 11.79 Ecus -- implying the highest world price -- was for a small volume of 25,000 tonnes , which was not unusual . 
but the cumulative volume soared to 256,000 tonnes when the cut-off for bids rose to around 12.50 Ecus . 
and for a maximum of 12.87 Ecus , the trade wanted licences for 374,000 tonnes . 
for a few points more at 13 Ecus , the volume jumped again to 508,000 tonnes , traders said . 
at refunds of 13.40 Ecus or less , the volume was seen around 600,000 tonnes . 
&quot; This tender is going to be played out between 12.50 and 13 Ecus per tonne , &quot; said one trader , implying that the volume released for export from France this week would be between a quarter of a million and half a million tonnes . 
but others speculated that the European Commission might be even more cautious , knowing that by holding back until next week it would save the extra monthly carrying charge of 1.1 Ecus . 
last week the EU awarded licences for 238,000 tonnes at a maximum refund of 16.40 Ecus per tonne . 
licences are valid for the current month plus four subsequent months . 
traders receive monthly EU storage premiums of 1.1 Ecus per tonne for each of those months until the licence is finally used , but grain shipped in the month that the licence is actually issued comes without the carrying charge . 
traders said some who were short of licences were anxious to win export approval this week , knowing that seven days later they would have to raise their bids by 1.1 Ecus to stand still . 
the bids also appeared to include new business , they said , though demand remained very sporadic , with most major deals done . 
some remained convinced that what looked like uncovered EU business might stem partly from optional-origin sales and that the trade &apos;s needs might have been overstated . 
grain industry sources gave the following approximate breakdown for wheat export bids through France -- 25,000 tonnes at 11.79 Ecus , 153,000 tonnes at 12.25 Ecus or less , 256,000 at 12.50 or less , 325,000 at 12.75 or less , 375,000 at 12.87 or less , 508,000 at 13.00 or less , 600,000 at 13.40 or less , 625,000 at 13.80 or less and 942,500 at a maximum 17.74 Ecus .
