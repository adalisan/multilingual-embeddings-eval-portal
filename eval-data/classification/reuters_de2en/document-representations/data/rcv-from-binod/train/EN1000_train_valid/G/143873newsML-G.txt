Member states were told on Friday to clean up their act and plug holes in the internal market ahead of the move to a single currency . 
&quot; The single currency is the optimisation and perfection of the single market which will enable it to develop its full potential , &quot; Mario Monti , the Commissioner responsible for the single market , told a news conference after a meeting of the Council . 
he said it would be &quot; deeply inconsistent &quot; if , as the Union forges on to new ambitions , its existing structures continued to have holes . 
the single currency is due to come into effect on January 1 , 1999 , as the final stage of Economic and Monetary Union . 
Irish trade and tourism minister Enda Kenny , who presided at the meeting , said member states were not applying satisfactorily the laws intended to create a border-free zone for goods , services , capital and people in both qualitative and quantitative terms . 
&quot; Most member states need to do better in quantitative and qualitative implementation , &quot; he told the news conference . 
Monti said the member states &apos; record had hardly improved since the Council met in May . 
so far only 93.3 percent of the 219 pieces of internal market white paper legislation had been transposed , he said , against 92.6 percent in May . 
he unveiled plans for an information campaign to be launched on November 26 , intended to show how the market -- which came into force on January 1 , 1993 -- can help people in their daily lives , even if it is still far from perfect . 
the campaign , with the help of a World Wide Web site , guides and telephone hotlines , will give information on living , working and studying in the EU , buying goods in other EU countries and making use of EU laws on health , safety and equal opportunities , Kenny said . 
the Council met counterparts from eastern Europe , who are queueing up for membership , and agreed to tighten adminstrative cooperation to allow the candidates to speed up preparations for taking on board the EU market legislation in time for entry . 
a new meeting will be held with the central and eastern European countries during the Dutch presidency on March 10 , 1997 .
