Russian Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov , renewing his assault on Alexander Lebed &apos;s peace deal in breakaway Chechnya , said on Monday the ceasefire was undermining Russia &apos;s ability to restore order in the breakaway republic . 
Kulikov , a fierce critic of Lebed &apos;s August 31 deal with the Chechen separatists , went on the offensive as his rival embarked on his first ever trip to the West as the guest of NATO headquarters in Brussels . 
&quot; Peace is a long way off and both politicians and the military will have to fight hard to secure it , &quot; said Kulikov . 
&quot; There is no real calm in Chechnya right now . 
under Lebed &apos;s deal Russian troops , which failed to establish control over Chechnya in 21 months of bloody fighting , started withdrawing from the region last month . 
a decision on whether Chechnya would become independent was deferred for five years . 
last week Kulikov , seen by Lebed as one of the architects of the conflict , drew loud applause in the State Duma ( lower house of parliament ) when he described the peace deal as a humiliating step towards the disintegration of Russia . 
he said on Monday some parties had deliberately exaggerated the numbers of people killed in the conflict , which he put at around 18,500 . 
estimates that put the figure as high as 100,000 were &quot; a conscious lie with far-reaching aims &quot; , he added . 
Lebed , a reserve paratroop general who became secretary of the policy-making Security Council in June , told the Duma last week that up to 100,000 people perished in the Chechen conflict and he has said that Kulikov should quit . 
Lebed has said he is sure the deal improves the chances of keeping Chechnya as part of Russia . 
President Boris Yeltsin , who is preparing for heart surgery , said Lebed had carried out his instructions to end the war promptly . 
on Monday Kulikov repeated his claims that the Chechens were violating the peace agreement . 
he said 139 people have been killed in the region since August despite the truce . 
rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev had failed to disarm his supporters and was calling up young men , some of whom were being trained in nearby Moslem countries . 
Kulikov said it was impossible for his ministry to perform its duties while the Chechens were setting up &quot; a medieval criminal code which allows them to stone people or cut off their arms or legs &quot; . 
the Chechens have introduced elements of Islamic law in the region , but there have been no reports of judicial amputations .
