protests from within the government about the way the Ministry of Finance ( MOF ) is managing public funds make it clear the 46-year-old scheme needs an overhaul , analysts said on Friday . 
the most vocal complaints have come from the Health and Welfare Ministry , led by its feisty minister Junichiro Koizumi , who has criticised MOF for planning to cut the interest rates it pays on deposits made by other ministries . 
analysts said even though it was likely the rates will eventually be cut , the outcry has focused attention on reforming Japan &apos;s Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme ( FILP ) . 
MOF has been pushing to cut the rate , which has not changed since January despite a recent fall in the issue rate on 10-year Japanese government bonds , on which the deposit rate is customarily set . 
the deposit rate has been at a record-low 2.9 percent since January . 
MOF is supposed set its rates in line with market interest rates , a MOF official said , adding the changes should also be approved by the three MOF , posts and Telecommunications , and Welfare ministers . 
FILP has been dubbed Japan &apos;s second national budget , because it uses deposits made by the Welfare and posts and Telecommunications ministries to fund government-affiliated financial institutions and other quasi-governmental bodies . 
the balance sheets of many of those entities show big deficits . 
Koizumi has charged that the system should either be stopped or revamped because the semi-governmental financial institutions and bodies are inefficient and poorly managed . 
analysts said FILP , which directs money to the financial institutions and other bodies which in turn loan it to private corporations and individuals , needs to become more market oriented now that capital markets play a major role in fund-raising by private corporations . 
&quot; FILP is a rigid scheme in which interest rates do not reflect the credibility of borrowers , &quot; said Ju-ichi Yamanaka , senior industry economist at NLI Research Institute . 
&quot; One solution could be to allow semi-governmental bodies to raise funds by issuing bonds , &quot; Yamanaka said . 
but he had softened his attacks this week . 
&quot; It is one step forward for Japan &apos;s fiscal reforms that we have discussed such an important issue ( as FILP reforms ) in parliament . 
I would say it was worth it to ask MOF to reconsider ( its planned rate cut ) and to say that I would not give in so easily , &quot; he told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday . 
on Friday , Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a news conference he would like a decision made on the rate changes by the end of next week . 
as of March 1996 , FILP had supplied 356 trillion yen worth of loans to semi-governmental corporations and financial institutions .
