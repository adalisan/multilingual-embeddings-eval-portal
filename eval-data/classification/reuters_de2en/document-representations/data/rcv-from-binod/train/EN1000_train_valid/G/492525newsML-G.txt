Indonesian President Suharto &apos;s youngest son , a business tycoon who has attracted much controversy , will marry a descendant of Javanese royalty later this month , Media Indonesia newspaper reported on Monday . 
Hutomo Mandala Putra , also known as Tommy Suharto , has been called one of Indonesia &apos;s most eligible bachelors in local newspapers . 
reports of his past alliances with a local singer and other women have filled many gossip columns . 
media Indonesia said Mandala Putra , 35 , will marry 22-year-old Raden Ayu Ardhia Pramesti Rigita Cahyani ( Tata ) , an Australian-educated descendant of the Mangkunegoro dynasty and also a distant relative through his mother &apos;s family . 
the newspaper quoted an official at the Mangkunegoro palace in the central Java town of Solo as saying preparations for the wedding , to be held on April 30 , had been launched . 
independent confirmation was not immediately available . 
&quot; Based on the Mangkunegoro family tree , Tommy is still regarded as Tata &apos;s uncle , but according to us that is not a problem , &quot; Media Indonesia quoted another source as saying . 
it said the couple met less than a month ago , but gave no other details . 
mandala Putra heads the Humpuss Group , which last year was awarded tax and tariff breaks by the government to manufacture a national car in collaboration with Kia Motors of South Korea . 
Japan , the United States and the European Union have complained to the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) against the move , which they have labelled as an unfair trade practice . 
Suharto has six children -- three sons and three daughters . 
mandala Putra is the only one who is still single .
