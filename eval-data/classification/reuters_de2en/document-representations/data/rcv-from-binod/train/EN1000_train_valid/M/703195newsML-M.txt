Madrid stocks continued their record run on Wednesday , ending at fresh closing highs which dealers said was more a reflection of the fact that there were few sellers rather than any new incentives to buy . 
the general index rose 9.78 points , 1.61 percent , to 618.36 and the ibex added 125.03 points , 1.79 percent , to 7,094.94 . 
gains were concentrated in Repsol , Telefonica , pushing up after a period of underperformance in heavy trade . 
Telefonica broke key resistance at 4,415 pesetas to end up 125 pesetas to 4,440 . 
participants said a correction was due , with the ibex now more expensive than some core markets . 
however they could not see when this might emerge , with investment fund flows into the market continuing to push up prices beyond fair values . 
&quot; This is madness . 
there haven &apos;t been any sellers all day so prices have had to rocket . 
it &apos;s going to take a shock news item to bring the market down , and when it does it &apos;ll come down hard , &quot; said a dealer at a foreign brokerage in Madrid . 
some talked of a possible new rate cut at Thursday &apos;s Bank of Spain repo auction . 
but most dismissed the idea . 
all ten analysts polled by Reuters today agreed the central bank will hold its key money rate at 5.25 percent on Thursday .
