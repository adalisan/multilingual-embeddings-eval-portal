more Malaysians have applied for student visas to Australia in the past five-and-a-half months compared with the same period in 1995 , figures from the Australian High Commission here showed . 
between July 1 and December 16 , 1996 , a total of 1,471 student visas were issued to Malaysians compared with 1,271 in the same period last year , a spokeswoman at the High Commission in Kuala Lumpur told Reuters on Wednesday . 
she was responding to questions about whether the recent debate on race issues in Australia had affected the number of Malaysian students heading to that country . 
Malaysian students in Australia have come under the spotlight this week following a report that several have had &quot; nasty experiences &quot; involving racial abuse . 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Monday the country might consider bringing back its students in Australia if reported threats against them were found to be serious . 
&quot; We want to get information on whether ( the situation ) is really dangerous . 
( if so ) we will take action , whether by bringing them home or offering them protection , &quot; he told reporters . 
racism has become a major issue in Australia since independent politician Pauline Hanson said in her maiden Parliament speech in September that Australia was being swamped by Asians . 
she called for an immediate moratorium on immigration , but Australian leaders have distanced themselves from Hanson &apos;s comments and said she does not reflect the official view . 
Asians make up about five percent of Australia &apos;s 18 million population . 
more than 11,000 Malaysians are studying in Australia .
