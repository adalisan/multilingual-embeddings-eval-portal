inland Steel Industries Inc said Wednesday its target is to attain a prime yield of 83 percent in 1997 and then one percentage point of gain in each of the next three years . 
at its annual meeting here , the company said it expects second quarter results to top those of the first quarter . 
&quot; While the second quarter is not yet over , I am confident that we will exceed our fine first quarter performance , &quot; said Robert Darnall , chief executive of Inland . 
Darnall also said steel prices &quot; seem to have stabilized . 
the company said its Inland Steel Co unit has a goal of lowering operating costs by $ 10 per ton , after inflation , in each of the next three years . 
&quot; I believe we will achieve this goal and more , &quot; said Dale Wiersbe , senior vice president . 
Wiersbe said the steel company has a goal of shipping 5.5 million tons of steel per year without purchasing semi-finished steel from outside sources . 
&quot; Our shipments have been flat at about 5.1 million tons for the last several years , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We expect to ship more steel this year than at any time since 1981 ... and do it all with self-manufactured product , &quot; he said . 
Prime yield is a measure of productivity used by the company that shows the portion of semi-finished steel produced that is shipped as prime-quality steel . 
inland earned $ 0.59 per share in the first quarter of this year on sales of $ 1.2 billion . 
after the meeting , Darnall said he was comfortable with the First Call second-quarter earnings estimate of about $ 0.63 per share , compared to $ 0.35 per share in earnings in the second quarter of 1996 after two one-time items .
