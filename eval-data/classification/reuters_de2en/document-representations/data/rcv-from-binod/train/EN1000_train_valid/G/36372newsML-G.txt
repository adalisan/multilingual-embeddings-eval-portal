U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher met French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette on Thursday to try to iron out differences with Paris over this week &apos;s American missile strikes on Iraq . 
France withheld support for the U.S. raids , saying Baghdad had breached no U.N. resolution by sending troops into Kurdish areas of northern Iraq at the request of a Kurdish faction . 
it also has refrained from joining the United States and Britain in policing an enlarged no-fly zone over southern Iraq . 
shortly before Christopher arrived , French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said Paris was still studying the implications of the U.S. decision to extend the zone from the 32nd to the 33rd parallel , just south of Baghdad . 
French fighters were meanwhile continuing to take part in patrols south of the 30th parallel , which covers Kuwaiti airspace and a small portion of southern Iraq , the Defence Ministry said . 
irked by the French coolness , Christopher agreed with British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind in London earlier on Thursday that their two countries could if necessary patrol the extended exclusion zone without French help . 
&quot; In discussions on the no-fly zone , they agreed that no matter what the French do , the U.S and the U.K. have the capability to implement effectively the ( expanded ) no-fly zone , &quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters . 
Rummelhardt told a briefing that France was also seeking changes in a draft U.N. Security Council resolution on Iraq offered by Britain , to ensure that Iraq &apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity were properly stressed . 
Christopher was due to meet President Jacques Chirac , who has not commented publicly on the Iraqi crisis , after his talks with de Charette . 
&quot; I hope that after our conversations this afternoon that the French will go forward with the operations as we have had in the past , &quot; Christopher said in London . 
France was an important member of the U.S.-led coalition which drove Iraqi invasion forces out of Kuwait in 1991 .
