Hong Kong &apos;s former immigration chief said on Friday he was forced out of his job last year , directly contradicting the government &apos;s version of his sudden departure . 
Laurence Leung , testifying under oath to a Legislative Council panel of inquiry , also said he had been investigated -- and cleared -- by Hong Kong &apos;s powerful anti-graft watchdog , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC ) . 
Leung , whose mysterious departure caused an uproar , was responsible for passports and immigration security , highly sensitive areas in the run-up to Hong Kong &apos;s transfer from Britain to China in mid-1997 . 
he had access to secret data on the overseas citizenships of Hong Kong officials and on mainland dissidents sheltering in Hong Kong , as well as control over immigration from China . 
Leung said it was impossible for anyone in his department to leak sensitive information . 
&quot; The Immigration Department has a very secure ( computer ) system to prevent confidential information leaking , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Any person , including the director , who has made any access , would be recorded in the system . 
&quot; There is no chance for me to cheat . 
Leung told the panel he was summoned by the Secretary for the Civil Service , Lam Woon-kwong , on July 5 . 
&quot; During the meeting , he said the government wanted me to resign immediately . 
he said if I didn &apos;t put in my resignation letter before 5 p.m. the Hong Kong government would take measures to force me out , &quot; Leung said . 
Mr Lam replied that was because the government did not trust me anymore . 
he said , &apos; you should know &apos; . 
the Hong Kong government has said Leung &apos;s early retirement , announced on July 6 , was for personal reasons and has flatly refused to elaborate . 
Lam told reporters after Leung &apos;s testimony that the government would issue a statement later on Friday . 
Leung , who worked for the government for 30 years and headed the immigration department for seven years , said the ICAC launched an investigation into his affairs in October 1995 . 
he said he was cleared the following April . 
the ICAC said in a statement on Friday its investigation ended due to insufficient evidence . 
the panel will summon Lam and his deputy to testify on January 23 . 
panel chairman IP Kwok-him told reporters after the four-hour session with Leung that panel members did not rule out also asking Governor Chris Patten and his deputy , Anson Chan , to testify .
