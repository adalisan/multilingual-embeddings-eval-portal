a war of supremacy between members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and party dissidents , supported by Congress legislators , led to the adjournment of Rajasthan assembly . 
BJP leadership accused the United Front government of creating a Gujarat-like situation to dislodge the Bhairon Singh Shekhawat government in the state .

the Department of Telecommunications ( dot ) has started insisting on guarantees from all foreign companies involved in telecommunication joint ventures in India that they would seek its permission before selling their equity . 
dot sources said the move would enable the department to know which company was divesting its stake and which company was buying it .

Ibrahim .

sources said since the positions of both the ministers were known , the issue could generate some heat in the cabinet and CCFI meetings .

this leaves Mitsui of Japan and Interquissa of Spain as potential joint venture partners for the project .

the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) directed the stock market regulator ( SEBI ) to cap foreign institutional investors &apos; ( FIIs ) exposure in debt floatations by Indian corporates . 
SEBI had recently allowed FIIs to invest 100 percent of their funds in debt issues . 
the RBI feels FIIs can have a 100 percent dedicated debt fund corpus but their exposure to specific debt floatations cannot be left open . 
currently SEBI has pegged a cap only on overall FII investment in debt at $ 1-1.5 billion , which is within the $ 7 billion ceiling on external commercial borrowings .

this is a 1.5 percent increase over the March 3L , 1996 figure and a 3.6 percent growth as compared to the same period in the previous fiscal . 
non-food credit also went up by 42.77 billion rupees in the same period while food credit came down by 4.77 billion to 85.71 billion rupees in the period .

the stock market regulator ( SEBI ) is examining its powers relating to giving clearance for bourses to expand their trading networks beyond the country . 
while SEBI is not averse to giving such clearance in the interests of transparent trading and bringing in greater non-resident Indian funds , it is weighing several issues related to the matter . 
one issue is that this would involve clearance from the central bank . 
but the broader issue is whether SEBI has a role at all , since the jurisdiction of the legislation governing the stock markets is restricted to within the country . 
meanwhile , the Bombay bourse ( BSE ) board has cleared a proposal for putting up BSE terminals in the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom .

the decanalisation of sugar exports , effected through a recent ordinance , is unlikely to end the Indian Sugar and General Industries import-export Corporation &apos;s ( ISGIEC ) monopoly over exports . 
ISGIEC is run jointly by the apex bodies of the cooperative and private sugar makers . 
legislation , needed to replace the ordinance before the last day of the forthcoming budget session , was unlikely to be passed since the Congress had made known its opposition to the bill , industry sources said . 
earlier , the decanalisation bill was withdrawn from the Upper House on the last day of the winter session after it became clear that it could be blocked . 
business Line 
the oil pool account is likely to close the fiscal year with a deficit higher than the projected 155 billion rupee figure as the country faces a further shortfall in crude production . 
as per latest government estimates , crude production would fall 0.7 MMT to 0.5 MMT short of the target fixed after the midterm evaluation , necessitating additional imports to the tune of 4.5 billion rupees . 
the target set at the beginning of the year has already been downscaled by 4.5 MMT in the midterm review . 
demand growth for petro-products , however , is likely to conform to the projected seven percent , lower than the 10 percent recorded in the previous fiscal .
