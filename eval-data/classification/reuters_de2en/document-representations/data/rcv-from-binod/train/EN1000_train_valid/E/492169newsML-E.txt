Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said that central bank governors of the Group of 10 ( G10 ) countries believed inflation was under control in Europe . 
&quot; Inflation seems to be still under control , &quot; Tietmeyer said . 
speaking after a meeting of G10 central bank govenors , Tietmeyer said that the recent strengthening of the dollar had raised some import prices , which could have an impact on inflation . 
&quot; But all in all , there is no inflationary environment &quot; up to now , Tietmeyer said . 
&quot; We don &apos;t see a special inflationary situation in Europe , but of course the situation is different from country to country , &quot; he said . 
&quot; For example , the U.K. is different from the continent , and we have to wait to see what will be the outcome of the elections . 
we have to wait and see what will be the policy then , &quot; Tietmeyer said .
