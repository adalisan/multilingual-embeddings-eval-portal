Kenyan security forces fought running battles with demonstrators in Nairobi on Saturday after breaking up a banned protest rally by opposition and church leaders demanding constitutional change . 
police and paramilitary units fired teargas grenades and wielded billyclubs to drive around 2,000 protesters out of central Uhuru Park and then fought battles with protesters , effectively closing central Nairobi . 
there was no immediate news on arrests and injuries . 
&quot; We are here to defy the illegal law called the Public Order Act because it is against the constitution , which states that there is freedom of assembly and association , &quot; opposition Ford Asili MP Martin Shikuku told Reuters . 
Kenya &apos;s government declared the rally illegal on Friday , warning the public not to attend .
