Walter Cronkite , the CBS anchorman who set the tone for the dominance of network television news , underwent successful quadruple bypass heart surgery on Tuesday , his assistant said . 
&quot; The surgery is complete , it was very successful and he is recovering , &quot; said Julie Sukman , Cronkite &apos;s assistant at CBS . 
the surgery at New York Hospital Cornell Medical Center was recommended after Cronkite , 80 , had a check-up last week , she said . 
he did not have a heart attack , she said . 
he is expected to stay in the hospital for four or five days , which is normal for surgery of this type , she said . 
Cronkite started the first national half-hour nightly news for CBS in 1963 and presided over it until he retired at age 65 in 1981 , developing a reputation as the &quot; most trusted man in America . 
in his memoir , &quot; A reporter &apos;s Life , &quot; published at the end of last year , Cronkite wrote that the medium he helped create , which weaned many Americans off newspapers and led them to depend first on TV for news , was seriously flawed . 
he also said his greatest disappointment was not having had a chance to go to the moon .
