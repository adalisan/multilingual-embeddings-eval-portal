Philippines Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said on Wednesday the country would ask for an extension of an International Monetary Fund programme after Congress said it would be unable to pass a crucial tax bill within the week . 
&quot; We will ask for an extension , &quot; de Ocampo told reporters after he met with Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson . 
the tax bill is the last of a package of major tax measures set under the three-year IMF programme scheduled to last until June 23 . 
de Ocampo said he still had to discuss with congressional leaders how long the extension would be , but said it would not go beyond this year . 
earlier , Senate Ways and Means Committee chairman Juan Ponce Enrile said the Senate would be able to pass the bill before the end of August . 
the Congress is set to go into recess on Thursday and reconvene in the third week of July . 
the bill , which aims to generate 18 billion pesos a year , would expand the number of people who pay income taxes and overhaul the corporate income tax structure . 
the Senate is still deliberating on its bill . 
one already passed by the House of Representatives has been opposed by government which argues it has too many loopholes . 
once the Senate passes its version , a bicameral committee will be formed to sort out the differences .
