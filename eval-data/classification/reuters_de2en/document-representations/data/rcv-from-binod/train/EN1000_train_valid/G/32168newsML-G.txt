President Bill Clinton welcomed the meeting on Wednesday between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat , saying it showed a willingness to find peace . 
&quot; It reflects their continuing commitment to resolving their differences through negotiations and to securing a lasting peace , &quot; Clinton said in a statement after Netanyahu and Arafat shook hands for the first time and met for an hour on the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel . 
the meeting marked formal acceptance by Netanyahu of Arafat as a negotiating partner three years after the Palestinian leader sealed a peace agreement with assassinated Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin in a White House ceremony . 
&quot; The meeting between the two leaders is a very important step in developing an Israeli-Palestinian partnership so essential to implementation of their agreements , &quot; Clinton said in a statement read by Press Secretary Mike McCurry . 
the United States , a co-sponsor of Middle East peace efforts , has put strong pressure on the right-wing Israeli leader to meet Arafat , whom he used to brand a &quot; terrorist . 
Netanyahu visits Washington next week and Clinton &apos;s statement said : &quot; I look forward to meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu next Monday to review progress and discuss developments in the region .
