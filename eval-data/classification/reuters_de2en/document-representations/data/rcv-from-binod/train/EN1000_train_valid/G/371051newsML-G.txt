a Malaysian youth group linked to the country &apos;s dominant political party is opposed to planned compulsory non-military national service for young people , a local newspaper reported on Tuesday . 
&quot; What is the point of imposing something new ? 
what we should do is expand and develop what we already have , &quot; the Star newspaper quoted the United Malays National Organisation ( UMNO ) youth education committee chairman as saying . 
Khalid Nordin suggested that the government incorporate existing youth programmes in all schools and expand group activities already in place , the article said . 
UMNO is the leading party in Malaysia &apos;s ruling National Front coalition . 
a national service programme was proposed last week as one way to combat social problems among the country &apos;s Moslem population . 
on Monday , Deputy Education Minister Fong Chan Onn was quoted as saying that a national service programme may be made mandatory for all Malaysian secondary school graduates as well as those pursuing tertiary courses . 
Malaysia does not have military conscription , so the proposed scheme would be the country &apos;s first compulsory national service for young people . 
the Youth and Sports Ministry is working on a paper on national service . 
the non-military service could be modelled along the lines of summer camps in the United States . 
Malaysia has launched a campaign against drug abuse , incest and crime besetting the Moslem community , which makes up more than half of the country &apos;s 21 million population .
