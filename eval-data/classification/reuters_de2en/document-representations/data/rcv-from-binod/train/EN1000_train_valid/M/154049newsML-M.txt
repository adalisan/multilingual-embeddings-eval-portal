Sri Lanka stocks , which slumped to a three-year low in June , are expected to end the year on an improved note on the back of better corporate results and a market-friendly budget for 1997 , analysts said . 
the all share index , which closed at 599 points on Tuesday , should rise at least 26 points , or 4.3 percent , to 625 by the end of 1996 , driven by improved earnings in the second half of 1996 and a pro-business budget due out on November 6 , they said . 
the index fell below 600 points for the first time in over three years in late June amid gloomy economic forecasts stemming from a drought and crippling power cuts . 
&quot; The index should rise to at least 625 points by December 31 , driven by results in manufacturing stocks which have recovered from the power cuts , &quot; said Channa Kurukulasuriya , head of research at the brokerage Lanka Securities . 
the six listed plantation firms should also do well , since tea prices have been at record highs in 1996 , he said . 
several analysts are bullish on President and Finance Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga &apos;s budget , saying it will be &quot; business friendly &quot; with caps on the deficit through reduced spending . 
the deficit is forecast to be contained at eight percent of GDP ( gross domestic product ) in 1997 . 
deficit forecasts for 1996 are about nine percent , up from 8.4 percent in 1995 . 
&quot; We see the all share close to 650 points by the end of the year , supported by good corporate results and a business-friendly budget , &quot; said Nouzab Fareed , general manager of Allied Phillips Securities . 
the budget should focus on further reducing subsidies and cutting defence spending , which will be good for overall economic growth , he said . 
the government has so far reduced subsidies on wheat flour and petroleum , and Fareed said there could be more cuts on November 6 . 
the government recently said defence spending , projected to be about 48 billion rupees in 1996 , would be scaled down to around 44 billion rupees in 1997 , as most required military hardware had already been purchased . 
military spending rose sharply in early 1995 after Tamil Tiger separatists , fighting for a homeland in the north and east of the Indian Ocean island , ended a truce in April . 
Rajan Asirwatham , head of the state privatisation unit , said the government would get 22 billion rupees ( $ 385 million ) in revenues from privatisations in 1996 , mainly from restructuring the ailing national carrier Airlanka and Sri Lanka Telecom . 
sale of a steel mill , bank and control in the remaining 17 plantation firms will also be completed in 1996 , he said . 
however , some analysts doubted whether those targets could be reached . 
&quot; We believe the budget will be neutral at best , and the market will firm mainly on good second-half results , &quot; said Rajiv Casie Chetty , an analyst at the brokerage CT Smith . 
Casie Chetty expressed doubt whether the budget would show the way to containing the deficit , citing high defence spending and a shortfall from privatisation proceeds . 
but other observers expect the budget to give a boost to the stock market by increasing tax advantages for listed companies . 
other expected relief measures include removals of stamp duty on the value of new debenture issues and new share capital , a stock exchange official said .
