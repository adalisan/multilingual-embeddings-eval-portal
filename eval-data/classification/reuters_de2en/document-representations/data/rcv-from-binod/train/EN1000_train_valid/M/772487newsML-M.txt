the Singapore rubber market closed weakly on Friday with most of the trade flying out of the country in the afternoon session to attend an industry meeting in the Indonesian resort of Bali , dealers said . 
&quot; The physical side of the market was not very active today simply because most of the people were not around . 
everybody has gone to Bali , &quot; a dealer said . 
trading was thin with only a few sporadic deals done for forward shipments of RSS3 rubber and some deals for RSS1 rubber . 
&quot; It was dull today . 
you can &apos;t do a lot of business if there is nobody around to do it with , &quot; another trader said . 
strong Japanese prices failed to lift the market despite a strong rise in Tokyo , where the key January contract finished 1.9 yen up at 123.4 mainly on the back of a weaker yen . 
&quot; We basically sat through the afternoon waiting for the day to finish , &quot; a dealer said , adding his calls to the offices of his customers were not answered because there was no one around to pick up the phone . 
at 0945 GMT , September RSS3 was seen at 95.25 U.S. cents a kg from 95.00 cents . 
September RSS1 was seen at 139.75 Singapore cents ( 95 U.S. cents ) a kg from 139.25 cents .
