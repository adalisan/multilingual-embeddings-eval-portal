Britain &apos;s FTSE 100 share index fell to a day &apos;s low of 4,600.7 in late trade on Friday , a drop of 53 points , as interest rate and pre-Budget concerns continued to dog the UK market , dealers said . 
despite a continued rally on Wall Street , the mood in London remained gloomy , dealers said , with few players prepared to buy and several unloading large quantities of shares . 
expectations that the new Labour government &apos;s July 2 Budget will abolish the tax breaks on dividend payments for pension funds and a growing conviction that British interest rates will rise next month were behind the bearish tone , analysts said .
