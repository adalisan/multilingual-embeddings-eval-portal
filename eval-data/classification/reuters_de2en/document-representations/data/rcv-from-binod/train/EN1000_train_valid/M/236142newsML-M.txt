U.S. stocks held steady despite stiff selling in the bond market , as investors renewed their bargain-hunting in laggard issues and focused attention on smaller cap issues . 
the steadiness in stocks amid the bond selloff &quot; is somewhat surprising , &quot; said Ed Nicoski , a Piper Jaffray technical analyst . 
&quot; What we &apos;ve seen the last few weeks and very noticeably yesterday is smaller caps acting better than blue chips . 
there &apos;s bargain-hunting in depressed issues and that will probably help preclude a major selloff in the near-term . 
the Dow industrials rose 11 to 6434 . 
the Russell 2000 , a measure of small company stocks , rose one to 359 . 
the Nasdaq composite rose four to 1301 . 
the long bond slumped 1-11 / 32 to yield 6.50 percent amid profit-taking and technical selling and some wariness ahead of Friday &apos;s key November employment report .
