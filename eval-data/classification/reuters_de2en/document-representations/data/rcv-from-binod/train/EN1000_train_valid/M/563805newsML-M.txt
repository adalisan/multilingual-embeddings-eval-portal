world oil prices were little changed and the outlook remains broadly neutral , said dealers on Tuesday . 
London June futures for bellwether North Sea Brent crude were unchanged at $ 17.97 at 1327 GMT . 
the market is pretty thin so even small volumes can shift prices , &quot; said Scott Carter , senior trader at Tosco Petroleum Corp in London . 
the market is balanced between faltering demand for diesel in Asia and expectations of a seasonal pick up in gasoline demand in the United States . 
&quot; We still haven &apos;t really seen how US gasoline demand will effect things , &quot; said Carter . 
gasoline demand in the United States is expected to rise to a record 8.14 million barrels per day ( bpd ) this summer , up 1.8 percent from last summer , the Energy Information Agency ( EIA ) said last month . 
to meet the growth &quot; much hinges on the ability of U.S. refiners to step up gasoline production to new highs , and on the continued availability of foreign supplies suitable for the U.S. market , &quot; the EIA said . 
Western refineries are returning to full production after heavy repair work which should ensure high gasoline production . 
crude oil supplies are also likely to grow in the coming months on the back of growing Iraqi exports and new North Sea supplies . 
British Petroleum said on Tuesday that &quot; although there is strong underlying growth in oil demand , oil prices prospects will be influenced by the scale of increases in oil production in the coming months &quot; . 
the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , the West &apos;s oil &quot; watchdog &quot; , expects oil production from countries outside the Organisation of the Petroleum exporting Countries ( OPEC ) to rise by 0.7 million bpd in the third quarter this year . 
OPEC &apos;s ministerial output monitoring committee will meet on Wednesday to discuss the 11-member group &apos;s quota compliance . 
independent assessments of OPEC &apos;s production estimate the organisation is producing close to 27 million bpd , compared to its agreed supply ceiling of 25.03 million bpd . 
but despite overproduction by OPEC , demand in the third quarter is expected to rise by 0.9 million bpd after falling by 2.4 million in the second , the IEA said in it &apos;s most recent report . 
some dealers now believe the price drop of some 30 percent this year has fully reflected the falling demand and growing supply of recent months . 
Kuwaiti Oil Minister ISA al-Mazeedi predicted a rise in oil prices later this year due to low winter stocks . 
&quot; crude prices naturally rise during the winter ( in the northern hemisphere ) and the period prior to that when oil reserves by many states , especially the consuming industrial nations , reaches low levels , &quot; he said on Tuesday .
