Brian Lara &apos;s resurgence has been overdue , precious and ultimately mysterious . 
so precious , in fact , that West Indies are refusing to comment , almost as if they fear his recaptured form will disappear just when they need it most . 
Lara , himself , and captain Courtney Walsh will not talk . 
and manager Clive Lloyd said Lara , like many other great players , had simply needed time to work his way through a slump . 
&quot; Well he &apos;s a great player , &quot; Lloyd said . 
&quot; You know everybody goes through these problems , these form reversals . 
he &apos;s had a slump and now he &apos;s through it . 
whatever the reasons , the new year has produced the old Lara , with the Trinidadian left-hander set to play a leading role in the crucial fourth test against Australia starting in Adelaide on Saturday . 
Australia lead the series 2-1 and need only a draw in Adelaide to retain the Frank Worrell trophy they won in the Caribbean 19 months ago . 
West Indies must win the test for the series to remain alive when the two teams meet again in the fifth and final test in Perth starting on February 1 . 
Lara , who was unable to make more than 50 in his first 10 innings on tour , scored successive centuries in World Series Cup limited overs matches against Australia and Pakistan in the first 10 days of the New Year . 
his return to form coincided with West Indies coming from last to force their way into the World Series final against Pakistan , who clinched the best-of-three match final 2-0 on Monday . 
the West Indians are reluctant to speculate on the reasons for the remarkable form reversal of their prime player , who holds world records for the highest scores in test and first-class cricket . 
Lara has yet to prove on tour that he can carry his limited overs form into test cricket . 
while West Indies thrashed Australia by six wickets in three days in the third test in Melbourne last month , Lara &apos;s failure in that match tempered the touring team &apos;s celebrations . 
despite scoring 295 runs in three innings of 102 , 103 and 90 in the World Series tournament , Lara has not produced a major score in the test series . 
Lara has made just 77 in his six test innings on tour , with Glenn McGrath emerging as his nemesis , taking his wicket five times in the three tests . 
Lara said before the third test his form in five-day cricket was of even greater concern while West Indies were losing . 
&quot; I &apos;ve been worried knowing the team hasn &apos;t been doing very well , &quot; he said . 
I &apos;m not overly worried if I &apos;m not scoring runs and the team is doing well , but I think my failures have been part of the problems the team has been having . 
those concerns ended with the emphatic third test win , with Walsh saying he felt Lara would soon emulate the example set by the rest of the team in Melbourne . 
&quot; It &apos;s coming for him . 
it &apos;s just around the corner , &quot; Walsh said after the third test . 
Lara has clearly been in a better mood since the Melbourne test , a stark contrast to the second test in Sydney when he was reprimanded by team officials after storming into the Australian dressing room to protest against his dismissal . 
Lloyd , too , pointed to the third test as the turning point for the side . 
&quot; We &apos;ve been a good side playing badly , but we have turned the corner , &quot; he said .
