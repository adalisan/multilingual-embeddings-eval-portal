the United States is willing to support keeping the U.N. environment agency headquarters in Kenya in return for steep budget cuts and reform , Western diplomats said on Tuesday . 
the diplomats spoke to Reuters on the sidelines of the Governing Council of the U.N. 
environment Programme ( UNEP ) , the agency &apos;s legislative and policy organ , which has been sidetracked by American demands for reform . 
UNEP , founded in 1972 , is the only U.N. agency with its global headquarters in the developing world . 
critics , mainly from the developed world , are unhappy with UNEP &apos;s location in Kenya , citing its isolation from other U.N. global bodies , poor communications in this east African nation and low quality of staff . 
earlier on Tuesday , the U.S. led calls for reform and budget cuts in UNEP , calling it &quot; disjointed and in a state of crisis &quot; but China threw its weight behind the developing world &apos;s clamour for more aid to manage the golobal environment . 
diplomats said Washington appeared willing to use the carrot and stick approach . 
&quot; The Americans are saying moving UNEP from Nairobi is not going to happen . 
they are saying the United States will continue to support location of UNEP in Nairobi , &quot; a western diplomat said . 
another western diplomat added : &quot; But this does not mean they are abandoning their demands for reform . 
all they are saying is we will support you ( on the location of UNEP ) but understand and support our stand on cuts and reform . 
American delegates at the Nairobi Governing Council meeting , normally used to approve a programme on managing natural resources and improving the environment , declined comment on the issue of UNEP &apos;s location . 
this year &apos;s Council forum is being sidetracked by talk of reforms and finance because of failure to pay dues by the rich nations from the northern hemisphere . 
China on Tuesday endorsed a position adopted by the Group of 77 calling for more aid and for implementation of mainly Third World UNEP programmes abandoned last year for lack of funding . 
&quot; The Group of 77 and China cannot support the revision of the programme of work because it has deleted many of the projects which the members of this group are concerned about , &quot; said a joint statement issued by China and the Group . 
but the American delegation at the meeting attended by 100 nations and agencies has ruled out pumping in more funds into UNEP , saying the global environment watchdog needs urgent surgery and not more money . 
&quot; We believe strongly that UNEP is a very important agency , unfortunately we find this agency with a set of problems . 
it is in a state of crisis , &quot; delegation head William Dilday said in a speech read out on his behalf by a colleague . 
but throwing more money at UNEP &apos;s problems is not an answer to the problems . 
Western governments led by the United States want UNEP to refocus on its core tasks . 
these are identified as monitoring the state of the planet , identifying emerging issues and initiating global responses to them and promoting the development of international law .
