a Turkish Cypriot soldier was shot dead in Cyprus on Sunday by Greek Cypriots near the United Nations-patrolled buffer zone dividing the Mediterranean island , Turkey &apos;s Anatolian news agency said . 
it said the shooting , in which another Turkish Cypriot soldier was wounded , occurred about 4 a.m. ( 0100 GMT ) at a Turkish Cypriot guard unit in Guvercinlik village near Famagusta province . 
but Greek Cypriot police said that no shooting incidents had been reported in the Famagusta region overnight . 
&quot; We have nothing whatsoever , &quot; said a police spokesman . 
U.N. officials in Cyprus said they were checking the report . 
the Turkish foreign ministry in Ankara had no details . 
tensions have risen in the last month following the killing of two Greek Cypriots by security forces and civilians in the Turkish-occupied areas during demonstrations against the division of the island . 
the island has been virtually partitioned since Turkish troops invaded 22 years ago after a short-lived coup engineered by the military regime then ruling Greece . 
only Turkey recognises a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state set up in the north of the island in 1983 . 
some 30,000 mainland Turkish troops are stationed there , and the protracted dispute is a source of tension between Turkey and Greece , its neighbour and NATO partner . 
a senior aide to U.S. President Bill Clinton said on Thursday that Washington would push forward with its initiative to help reunite the divided island .
