in deciding to have bypass surgery , Russian President Boris Yeltsin has chosen the more radical of two options facing patients with his kind of heart condition , British doctors said on Friday . 
Yeltsin stunned his fellow Russians on Thursday when he took the unusual step for a Kremlin leader of disclosing his health problems , but he stopped short of giving any details of his planned operation . 
Yeltsin is suffering from ischaemic heart condition , which affects the blood supply to the heart muscle and causes chest pains because of the reduced blood flow . 
a top Russian doctor , Professor Valery Sadrikov , told Interfax news agency that Yeltsin would have a heart bypass operation at Moscow &apos;s Cardiological Centre . 
the British Heart Foundation , a major charity which funds research into heart disease , said the 65-year-old Russian leader was therefore likely have been forced to choose between bypass surgery or angioplasty , a less invasive treatment to clear clogged arteries using a miniature balloon . 
&quot; coronary artery bypass surgery has over the last 25 years proved to be an effective way of relieving the pain of angina and reducing the risk of sudden death from a heart attack , &quot; a spokesman for the foundation said . 
&quot; However , it does involve open heart surgery , which means seven to 10 days in hospital and a possible break of two or three months from work . 
bypass surgery involves taking a piece of vascular tissue , either from the leg or from the internal mammary artery , and using it to bypass blockages in the coronary arteries , which supply blood to the heart muscle . 
about 30,000 bypass operations are carried out in Britain every year , with 89 percent surving for five years after the operation and 80 percent surviving for 10 years . 
one of Britain &apos;s leading heart surgeons , Dr John Walwark of Papworth Hospital in Cambridge , said bypass surgery was the best option for Yeltsin . 
&quot; It &apos;s a pretty routine and safe operation , &quot; he told BBC radio . 
&quot; For his age and general fitness he should really have a very low risk of dying from the operation -- maybe around two percent . 
those odds would become less favourable if Yeltsin &apos;s previous heart attacks have damaged his kidneys . 
Philip Cook , marketing manager at London &apos;s St Anthony &apos;s Hospital , which does a lot of heart surgery , said Yeltsin could expect an immediate improvement in his general health after the operation . 
&quot; Obviously they are fairly knocked back as it &apos;s a major operation , but almost instantly their heart is beating better , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Once patients have had plenty of physiotherapy and recovered from the operation they are considerably better than they were before the operation , &quot; he told Reuters . 
the alternative , angioplasty , involves inserting a small catheter into an artery under local anaesthetic . 
close to the tip of the catheter is a small balloon , which is inflated to stretch the artery and clear the blockage . 
while angioplasty means patients only have to spend two or three days in hospital , about a third of patients need to undergo repeat treatment within two years because their arteries have clogged again . 
repeat surgery is less likely in patients opting for a bypass .
