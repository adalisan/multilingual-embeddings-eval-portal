blue-chip stocks closed lower Monday as a sharp drop in technology shares ended a rally sparked by news of Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. &apos; s mega-merger . 
the Dow Jones industrial average ended down 36.52 points at 6,268.35 after a drop of more than 50 points activated the New York Stock Exchange &apos;s limits on programme trading . 
in the broader market , declining issues beat advances 1,654 to 874 on active volume of 447 million shares on the NYSE . 
the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index plunged 23.93 points to 1,260.98 , its steepest fall since July 23 . 
analysts said profit-taking in technology stocks snowballed after computer and electronics retailer Circuit City Stores Inc. reported disappointing earnings . 
the market was extremely volatile , as investors bid up blue-chip stocks from the opening on Boeing &apos;s blockbuster $ 13.3 billion acquisition of McDonnell Douglas . 
Boeing rose 4 to 100-3 / 4 and McDonnell Douglas jumped 10-1 / 2 to 62-1 / 2 . 
technology shares also joined in the rally . 
the mood of investors soured in afternoon trading on news that Circuit City &apos;s quarterly earnings slumped to $ 19.8 million from $ 31.5 million a year ago . 
the Richmond , Va.-based company cited soft personal computer sales for the drop . 
analysts said the already apprehensive market seized on the Circuit City news and took the opportunity to sell . 
&quot; The market is assuming that because one bad retailer reported sloppy earnings , the entire tech industry is going to hell in a handbasket , &quot; said Philip Orlando , chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management . 
&quot; Technology investors tend to be very nervous and in this case the response was overblown . 
some of the session &apos;s biggest losses were posted by brand-name technology stocks , which analysts saw as a sign investors had decided to take some of their profits . 
&quot; If you &apos;re going to take profits in this market , the large-cap techs would clearly be the obvious targets , &quot; said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. 
international Business machines Corp. fell 4-1 / 8 to 148-3 / 4 and Intel Corp. lost 5-1 / 8 to 127-1 / 4 . 
Microsoft Corp. fell 3-1 / 4 to 76-3 / 4 . 
heightened caution was also evident when Morgan Stanley &apos;s global strategist , Barton Biggs recommended shifting some money out of stocks into cash and bonds . 
the move altered Morgan Stanley &apos;s global asset allocation portfolio to 56 percent stocks , 29 percent bonds and 15 percent cash . 
the portfolio had been weighted 74 percent to stocks and 26 percent to bonds before the switch . 
wall Street was also cautious ahead of Tuesday &apos;s meeting of the Federal Reserve &apos;s interest-rate setting Federal Open Market Committtee . 
release of stronger-than-expected industrial production data depressed the bond market , a response analysts attributed to the proximity of the Fed meeting . 
total output increased 0.9 percent last month , the biggest monthly increase since a 1.3 percent jump last February , the Federal Reserve said . 
&quot; The Fed doesn &apos;t set policy decisions on one number but the fact that it &apos;s the day before the meeting has people nervous , &quot; said Robert Froehlich , chief investment strategist at Van Kampen American Capital . 
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was off 21 / 32 , raising its yield , which moves in the opposite direction from the price , to 6.63 percent from 6.58 percent at Friday &apos;s close . 
the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s composite index of 500 stocks fell 7.65 to 720.99 .
