he said Friday &apos;s release of the U.S. November payrolls report was also making some investors cautious . 
analysts said the results were slightly disappointing but expected a better performance in the second half due to higher property sales . 
the company said it plans to issue 40 million new shares to Mansyong International Development Ltd at HK $ 3.95 per share , raising net proceeds of about HK $ 156 million .
