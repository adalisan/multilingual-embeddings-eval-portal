Peruvian security forces have captured 1,334 communist guerrillas so far in 1996 during a year of increased rebel activity , police said on Friday . 
Anti-guerrilla operations broke up 43 rebel cells between January and December , police chief Ketin Vidal said . 
the police could not give comparative figures for 1995 . 
more than 8,000 rebels from the Maoist Shining Path and the Cuban-style Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) groups have been jailed since Peru &apos;s guerrilla conflicts began in 1980 , according to the government . 
although greatly weakened since the 1992 capture of its leader Abimael Guzman , Shining Path has been increasingly active this year with a series of car-bombs , assassinations and clashes with security forces . 
Vidal said the security forces &apos; war on drugs , a rich source of funds for the guerrillas , had also led to at least 10,400 arrests so far this year .
