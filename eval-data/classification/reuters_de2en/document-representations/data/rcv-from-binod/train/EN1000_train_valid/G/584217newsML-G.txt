Canada &apos;s French-language televised debate for the June 2 federal election was cut short suddenly on Tuesday when the moderator collapsed , leaving the five political party leaders stunned . 
moderator Claire Lamarche , a well-known television personality in French-speaking Quebec , fell out of her chair moaning about the heat in the room , just as the five political party leaders were about to attack the defining election issue of national unity -- Quebec independence . 
&quot; We decided together that the debate should not continue under the circumstances , &quot; Arnold Amber , one of organizers of the debate , said in a hastily arranged news conference . 
&quot; All the parties are in agreement with this . 
the party leaders left without speaking to the media . 
Canadians had been expecting a lively debate on how to handle the troubling issue of Quebec . 
but the moderator &apos;s collapse made the abbreviated exchange anti-climactic , said political scientist Ken McRoberts at York University in Toronto . 
&quot; There might have been some dramatic moments in the exchange over the response to a ( pro-sovereignty vote ) , &quot; McRoberts said in a phone interview from Toronto . 
&quot; So ( separatist Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles ) Duceppe must be quite frustrated . 
Duceppe , a francophone , was sidelined in the English debate on Monday night but observers expected him to use the French-language debate to rally the separatist forces and gather support for his waning campaign . 
the debate was about two hours into its scheduled 2-1 / 2 hours when the moderator collapsed , just as Prime Minister Jean Chretien was asked if he would recognize a vote in favor of Quebec sovereignty if it were by a slim margin . 
in 1995 , people in French-speaking Quebec voted 50.6 percent against Quebec separation , while 49.4 percent voted in favor of separation , prompting federalist forces to claim victory . 
but instead of exploring how the next government would handle an expected referendum on sovereignty next year , the debate focused on Canada &apos;s high unemployment rate , robbing Duceppe of the chance to stir up much nationalist spirit .
