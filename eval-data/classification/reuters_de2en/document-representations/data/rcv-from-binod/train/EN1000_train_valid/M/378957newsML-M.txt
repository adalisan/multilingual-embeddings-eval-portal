Italian bond futures held to higher ground in late afternoon trading helped by comments from Prime Minister Romano Prodi and benign PPI inflation data from the U.S. for January , dealers said . 
Prodi said he did not exclude a mini-budget for this year of a &quot; modest size &quot; and will make the decision about this corrective action in the next few weeks . 
he added that he would like to bring forward the full 1998 budget , but this would need the clear backing of parliament to do so . 
&quot; The political concerns remain but Prodi &apos;s comments did sooth some nerves in the afternoon , &quot; said one LIFFE trader . 
dealers expect that the government will await official state accounts due in early March before making up its mind on a mini-budget . 
a report in the financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore quoting Treasury sources said Treasury minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi was proposing a 15 trillion lire mini-budget . 
but in an interview in another Italian newspaper , Ciampi said the government will assess in the next few weeks if it needs further measures in 1997 . 
dealers said the market had been concerned over a perceived uncertainty in the government &apos;s determination to address Italy &apos;s budget deficit and carry out key pension reforms . 
also helping the market was U.S. January PPI which slipped 0.3 percent , the first fall seen since October 1994 , while the the lira held largely steady throughout the day . 
&quot; The U.S. data helped treasuries and so clearly lent support to BTPs , &quot; said the LIFFE trader . 
dealers pointed out that the market will start to focus next week on preliminary CPI inflation data from 11 Italian cities due on February 20 and February 21 .
