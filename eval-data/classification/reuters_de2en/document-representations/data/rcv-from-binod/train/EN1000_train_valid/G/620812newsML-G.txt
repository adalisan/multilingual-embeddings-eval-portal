Pakistan said on Wednesday it would lodge a protest with India over what it said was a violation of its airspace by an Indian jet fighter . 
&quot; We will lodge a protest , &quot; a Foreign Ministry spokesman told Reuters . 
&quot; It will be done today or tomorrow morning . 
a Pakistan Air Force ( PAF ) statement said a loud boom which shook windows of buildings in Islamabad on Tuesday was caused by a high-flying Indian jet that broke the sound barrier when flying out of Pakistan airspace . 
&quot; The intruding aircraft was tracked by the PAF radar network and defensive measures were immediately ordered , &quot; it said . 
&quot; The violator , because of high altitude and speed , exited prior to retaliatory action . 
a defence ministry spokesman in New Delhi denied the aircraft was Indian , the United News of India said . 
&quot; No Indian aircraft has crossed the international border , &quot; the news agency quoted the spokesman as saying . 
defence Ministry officials were not immediately available for comment . 
an Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman earlier said he had no information about the incident . 
the PAF charged that the entry of the Indian jet , possibly an air force MiG-25R flying at more than 60,000 feet ( 18,288 metres ) , was presumed to have been either an intentional high speed reconnaissance run or an accidental violation . 
it said the plane had entered Pakistan airspace from the military control line dividing the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir near the border city of Sialkot and flew along the international boundary , exiting the control line near Poonch in Kashmir . 
a police official in Rawalpindi , near Islamabad , had told Reuters on Tuesday that the explosion heard in the capital was probably caused by a construction company levelling ground .
