both of the Brent cargoes nominated from the paper chains on Thursday were kept ahead of the five o &apos;clock deadline , traders said . 
one cargo , loading May 23-25 , was kept by the equity holder BP . 
the other , advanced from its original loading dates of May 28-30 to May 23-25 , was kept by equity holder Shell UK , they said . 
Brent cargoes are traded on a paper , or forward market until the 1700 London time deadline on the nearest trading day 15 days before their assigned loading date . 
a trading company is clocked when it is left with a paper cargo which has turned physical after that deadline and therefore cannot be passed on as part of pre-sold paper cargo deals .
