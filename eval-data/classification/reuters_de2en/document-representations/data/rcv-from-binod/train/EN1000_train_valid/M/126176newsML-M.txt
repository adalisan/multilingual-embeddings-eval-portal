IPE gas oil futures closed strongly on Friday , supported by Brent futures and speculative buying by large trading companies , brokers said . 
IPE gas oil closed $ 6.25 higher at $ 233.75 per tonne , and the Nov / Dec spread gained $ 2.00 to $ 6.50 per tonne . 
low U.S. heating oil stocks and tonight &apos;s oil industry meeting with Energy Secretary Hazel O &apos;Leary provided some support to gas oil , dealers said . 
November Brent gained 31 cents to $ 24.50 per barrel on continued conflict between Kurdish groups in northern Iraq and political instability in Russia . 
some U.S. analysts saw O &apos;Leary &apos;s meeting as playing politics ahead of the U.S. election on November 5 , but others predicted some voluntary re-stocking by U.S. majors ahead of winter despite the strong backwardation . 
output of distillates was at a three-year high of 3.6 million barrels per day last week , according to the Energy Information Administration . 
&quot; If ( refiners ) maintain it , they &apos;ll produce more than the market requires at this stage , &quot; said John Lichtblau , president of the U.S. Petroleum Industry Research Foundation , who will be attending the meeting . 
one dealer saw resistance for IPE November Brent at $ 24.52-57 per barrel , and said a break of $ 24.52 would trigger some heavy automatic buy orders .
