Pernilla Wiberg is treating Saturday &apos;s World Cup downhill as a dress rehearsal for next week &apos;s world championships in Sestriere . 
&quot; It looks like Sestriere , &quot; said the Swede , assessing the 2.6 kilometre Fatschas layout . 
&quot; It is a course for both gliders and technical skiers . 
&quot; It &apos;s good to have one like this just before Sestriere . 
Wiberg wasn &apos;t the only skier to spot a resemblance to the world championship piste . 
Italy &apos;s Isolde Kostner , who shared victory with Switzerland &apos;s Heidi Zurbriggen last weekend on home snow in Cortina , liked what she saw as she posted the fastest time in training runs on Thursday and Friday . 
&quot; Many parts of this downhill , particularly the turns and the way it goes up and down , are very similar to the one in Sestriere , &quot; said Kostner . 
the first women &apos;s downhill ever staged at Swiss resort will start a busy weekend of racing which also includes a slalom combined on Sunday , the same day the men will be marching in the opening ceremonies in Sestriere . 
with a total of 300 points on offer , Wiberg should consolidate her position on top of the overall rankings then move over to Italy and add to her collection of three world championship titles . 
but as she has all season , Wiberg refuses to be drawn into speculation about her title chances . 
normally effervescent and talkative , Wiberg was polite but restrained as she answered questions after training , rushing off at the first opportunity . 
&quot; I just think about one race at a time like I have all season , &quot; said Wiberg , who has also captured two Olympic gold medals . 
&quot; Saturday is a downhill and Sunday is a slalom -- that &apos;s it . 
that has been fast enough to leave Wiberg 294 points clear of her nearest rival in the overall rankings , defending champion Katja Seizinger of Germany . 
so far this season , the Swede has won four World Cup races , two super-Gs and two slaloms . 
no matter what the outcome , she will go to Sestriere leading the super-G and slalom World Cup standings as well as the overall World Cup , a prize never before captured by a Swedish woman . 
while Wiberg can wrap up the slalom title with a victory on Sunday the she appears more interested in the downhill , the only World Cup discipline in which she has yet to record a win . 
Seizinger , the Olympic downhill champion , will be looking to reclaim top spot in the downhill rankings from the surprising Zurbriggen . 
until just last year , Zurbriggen , a 12-year veteran of the Swiss team , had her name listed in the World Cup record book under &quot; great racers without a victory &quot; . 
but after collecting her maiden win at the end of last season , Zurbriggen &apos;s name can now be found atop the downhill standings , clinging to a precarious three-point advantage over Seizinger .
