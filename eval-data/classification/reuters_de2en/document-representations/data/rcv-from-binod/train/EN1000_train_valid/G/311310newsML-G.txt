Wellington , Jan 17 - Former New Zealand sevens captain Dallas Seymour is set to move to Wellington as a timely replacement for flanker Gordon Simpson , who is returning to North Harbour , NZPA reports . 
Wellington rugby coach Frank Walker said Seymour had been registered for transfer and was expected to be available to Wellington for next year &apos;s national championship . 
Simpson , Wellington &apos;s Player of the Year in 1995 and a member of the first Hurricanes squad , has already returned to Auckland . 
Simpson hopes to take advantage of his Scottish ancestry and move to Scotland in the hope of breaking into their national team . 
Walker said Simpson was a big loss to Wellington rugby but the prospect of Seymour &apos;s arrival was some consolation . 
&quot; We &apos;ve yet to see the best of Gordon . 
I had the feeling that this year might have been his year , &quot; Walker said . 
&quot; He had a slow start to last season and didn &apos;t really recover . 
&quot; But he &apos;s decided to move on and I can understand that . 
he wants to try his luck in Scotland and I would say he &apos;s as good , if not better , than anything they &apos;ve got there . 
Seymour has been rumoured for some time to be about to move from Hawke &apos;s Bay to Wellington . 
he was linked last year with Marist-St pats but he chose , after a Super 12 season disrupted by injury , to remain in Hawke &apos;s Bay . 
Walker said Seymour would become part of a forward pack that could be composed almost entirely of Super 12 players . 
Wellington have already gained All Black , King Country and Hurricanes prop Phil coffin . 
their pack comprises coffin , Tala Leiasamaivao , Bill Cavubati and Mike Russell among the tight five , and Seymour , Martin Leslie and Filo Tiatia among the loose forwards . 
all are members of the Hurricanes squad . 
Simpson is the most significant loss to Wellington between seasons , though several players are on the verge of leaving . 
Flanker Inoke Afeaki and halfback Joe Filemu are considering Japanese contracts , while prop Mike Edwards is sought by Southland . 
Wellington might gain a number of other useful players if their transfers can be approved . 
they are vying with Taranaki for a promising lock from the South Island and up to eight Tongan internationals , including their entire front row , are looking for places in Wellington teams .
