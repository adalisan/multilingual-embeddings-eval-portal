Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi won a first confidence vote in parliament on Thursday with his key hard-left ally back on board after it almost wrecked the governent by refusing to support a security force for Albania . 
the centre-left government won the do-or-die test , ordered by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro after Prodi was forced to rely on opposition votes to approve the mission , by 162 votes to 81 with one abstention in the Senate ( upper house ) . 
Prodi was never in danger since he commands an absolute majority in the Senate , but he relies on Communist Refoundation support for a majority in the Chamber of Deputies ( lower house ) , which begins its confidence debate on Friday and votes on Saturday . 
Communist Refoundation leader Fausto Bertinotti signalled that Prodi was out of immediate danger there too . 
&quot; We &apos;re against the military mission ... not against the government . 
it &apos;s obvious , therefore , that we will restore our confidence after the disagreement on the military intervention in order to face the question of the welfare state , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Because now it &apos;s pensions , jobs and health that we &apos;ve got to discuss , &quot; he told reporters in the southern town of Crotone . 
Prodi earlier warned that political instability could wreck Italy &apos;s hopes of making the grade when a decision is taken in May 1998 on which states will launch Europe &apos;s single currency . 
&quot; This is the only government which can take the country into Europe ... A crisis in this period would ruin this country because until May we cannot interrupt by as much as one day our efforts at overhauling ( state accounts ) , &quot; he said . 
but supporters and opponents alike questioned how long his 11-month-old government could continue in office despite Prodi &apos;s apparent success in healing the rift with Refoundation . 
Roberto Napoli , Senate leader of the small centrist CCD party , which belongs to the opposition centre-right Freedom Alliance , predicted that &quot; the contradictions in the majority which have already exploded will explode again . 
&quot; The confidence that you will win will just be like a fig leaf that will fly away at the first gust of wind , &quot; he said . 
Cesare Salvi , parliamentary leader of the largest group in the coalition government , the Democratic Party of the Left ( PDS ) , admitted Prodi may struggle to keep Refoundation in line . 
&quot; There &apos;s a problem . 
the cohesive , strong government that Prodi asks for , unhappily does not exist , &quot; he said . 
he and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini , whose centrist Italian Renewal Party is a government ally , called for a swift and thorough review of the partnership with Refoundation . 
Communist Refoundation sent a shudder through the coalition on Wednesday by refusing to back the deployment of Italian troops to protect aid shipments for lawless Albania . 
the decision , taken for ideological reasons , forced the government to rely on support from centre-right parties . 
Prodi spelt out ambitious plans for reform in his speech , saying a review of the welfare state must start immediately . 
&quot; It cannot be put off a day longer , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It must ... be clear that whoever gives us their confidence today must share the wide-ranging programme we have worked on and which we now want to bring to fruition , &quot; he added . 
Bertinotti said earlier this week that the crunch would come over welfare reform , seen as crucial to Italy &apos;s monetary union hopes . 
Refoundation is opposed to any cuts in social spending .
