President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro told politicians on Wednesday not to underestimate the discontent of northern Italians despite the failure of Northern League leader Umberto Bossi to draw big crowds at secessionist rallies . 
he issued his written message to both houses of parliament as police searched League offices and homes of members at the behest of magistrates investigating the movement on suspicion of having violated Italy &apos;s constitution . 
an Italian head of state will address parliament only rarely on solemn or urgent occasions . 
Scalfaro &apos;s use of the formula underscored his concern over last Sunday &quot; declaration of independence &quot; by separatist firebrand Bossi . 
&quot; Let us not make the mistake of thinking that now that the demonstrations are over , the question is closed , &quot; Scalfaro said in his message , read out by the two parliamentary speakers . 
he condemned secession as a &quot; sad theory &quot; but said it would be dangerous to ignore &quot; the malaise behind such discontent &quot; . 
he urged parliamentarians to display &quot; the broadest political will &quot; as they begin to debate constitutional reforms that are expected to include a new federal structure for Italy . 
&quot; There are reasons for protest . 
it &apos;s up to you to identify them , study them and confront them with courage and determination without losing time on diatribe and differences . 
I don &apos;t think there is room for that any more , &quot; he said . 
in frank language , he acknowledged that &quot; very many &quot; people with justified grievances probably stayed away from Bossi &apos;s weekend rallies because they did not support his push to split Italy between a prosperous north and a more backward south . 
Bossi declared &quot; independence &quot; for a &quot; federal republic of Padania &quot; last Sunday in Venice after an almost mystical three-day voyage along the River Po . 
his trek failed to draw anywhere near the number of followers he had predicted while the government has said more than one million Italians joined pro-unity rallies nationwide . 
responding to Scalfaro &apos;s message , Bossi said &quot; words have no effect on the north &quot; and demanded facts . 
the fundamental grievances of many northerners are high taxes , what they perceive as corrupt institutions and an incompetent central bureaucracy . 
some Italians , including former constitutional court president Ettore Gallo , have called for the arrest of Bossi and other League leaders for defying a constitutional ban on challenges to the unity of the state . 
Scalfaro said the state had &quot; the proper departments to intervene &quot; when laws were broken but that the overall response to the secessionists had to be &quot; above all political &quot; . 
magistrates in the northern cities of Venice , Verona , Mantua and Turin are investigating Bossi after the weekend declaration . 
Bossi has said he would declare himself a &quot; prisoner of war &quot; if he is arrested . 
in Verona , police said they had searched the home of Enzo Flego , coordinator of the &quot; green shirts , &quot; the self-styled stewards who protect League leaders and keep order at rallies . 
to many Italians , they hark ominously back to Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini &apos;s blackshirt militias . 
Prime Minister Romano Prodi &apos;s centre-left government is now working on two packages of laws giving local authorities more say in administration and taxation . 
a parliamentary commission is also to have two years to work on constitutional reform to give Italy a federal structure . 
after it is approved by parliament , it will go to a referendum .
