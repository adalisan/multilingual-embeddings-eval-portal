Bombay shares ended lower in a volatile session on Wednesday with auto and cement stocks leading the slide , traders said . 
&quot; Short covering at the end pulled prices slightly higher but there was a conspicuous absence of buyers during the day , &quot; said a chief dealer at a foreign brokerage . 
&quot; Large investors don &apos;t feel good about this market . 
Bombay &apos;s benchmark stocks index fell 62.30 points or 2.11 percent to end at a provisional 2886.14 , off a low of 2847.48 
the National Stock Exchange ( NSE ) index shed 18.83 points to a provisional 829.91 . 
India &apos;s largest cement maker ACC led the slide , plunging 138 rupees or 13.11 percent to 1,018 rupees , off a low of 980 . 
ACC said on Tuesday its net profit fell 56 percent to 550.5 million rupees in the first six months to September 30 , 1996 against 1.25 billion rupees . 
the firm said it could not recover an unprecedented increase in input cost , affecting margins . 
expectations had ranged from 800 to 900 million rupees . 
traders said the market had not discounted an impending oil price hike which was needed to curb India &apos;s oil pool deficit . 
&quot; A price hike of the magnitude necessary to affect the oil deficit will again hit second half results , &quot; the trader said . 
frontline auto firms TELCO , Bajaj Auto and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra -- which have recently been pounded lower on fears of a prolonged economic slowdown -- continued to head southward . 
some analysts have recommended investors go underweight on the sector but others said they remained bullish on auto . 
&quot; Sales growth continues to stay above 20 percent and next fiscal is likely to see a recovery . 
the extent of the slowdown has been exaggerated , &quot; said an analyst at a foreign brokerage . 
he said he maintained his buy recommendations on these three stocks .
