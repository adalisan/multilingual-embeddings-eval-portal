wall Street economists had expected July industrial production to rise 0.2 percent and estimated that the July capacity use rate would be 83.5 percent . 
motor vehicle assemblies rose in July to a rate of 5.8 million a year for new new cars from a revised 5.7 million in June , which the Fed had previously estimated at 5.8 million . 
for light trucks the assembly rate fell sharply to 4.9 million in July from 5.8 million in June . 
excluding motor vehicles and parts , July industrial output was up 0.3 percent after a 0.2 percent increase in June . 
the Fed said overall industrial output last month was slowed by a drop in production of motor vehicles and parts and to a lesser degree by declines in the production of a variety of nondurable goods . 
while auto output rose slightly , production of light trucks , vans and sport utility vehicles fell nearly 15 percent in July to a rate of 4.9 million units a year , it said . 
meanwhile , there were widespread production gains in a variety of other durable consumer goods , such as appliances , home computers and audio and video equipment , which helped lift the overall output level , Fed said . 
output of nondurable goods , however , declined in July as production of clothing , chemical products , paper products and fuels all decreased , it said .
