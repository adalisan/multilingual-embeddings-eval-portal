new names will abound in French franc and mark Eurobond markets in 1997 as borrowers rush to establish themselves with domestic investors before EMU . 
and it won &apos;t be one-way traffic . 
bond investors who have sheltered in domestic markets will have liven up to meet the challenge of the fresh horizons an expanded market will bring . 
potential euro currencies like the lira and peseta will also benefit from bond issuers &apos; desires to get wider name recognition and and even non-prime EMU currencies like Denmark &apos;s should see volumes be boosted by yield convergence . 
but sterling will likely be the ugly duckling in Europe , shunned internationally except for opportunistic issues . 
the first wave of European economic and monetary union is scheduled to start on January 1 , 1999 . 
Spain led the way for sovereign Eurobond borrowers in euro currencies this year , issuing substantial benchmark issues in both francs and marks and reintroducing itself to those markets . 
Denmark was also busy in marks . 
&quot; Italy seriously considered a jumbo franc bond at one stage and there &apos;s every chance it could head a bunch of new names next year , &quot; said a syndicate manager at a U.S. bank . 
they will be joined early in the new year by AAA-rated Fannie Mae which held roadshows in November ahead of an expected offering worth up to 5.0 billion francs . 
emerging sovereigns are likely to prefer the mark to the franc when choosing a euro currency . 
Russia will top the pile here with plans for a 1.0 billion mark five-year Eurobond . 
&quot; The problem with France is that you don &apos;t have the retail ( investor base ) and there &apos;s no retail ( demand ) outside France for the franc , &quot; said a syndicate manager on a French bank &apos;s emerging market desk . 
&quot; That leaves the ( French ) institutions and they can already get exposure to LatAm sovereigns through other routes . 
a syndicate manager at U.S. bank in London was more hopeful for the franc . 
&quot; We will see something . 
I wouldn &apos;t like to hazard a guess where or when but it &apos;s bound to happen . 
investors have to prepare for the changes a single currency will bring , mainly the chance to buy credits they have no previous exposure to . 
&quot; The French investor base will have to start considering more credits . 
that will open up more opportunities , &quot; the French bank syndicate manager said . 
European Investment Bank president Brian Unwin told Reuters recently that markets were already making decisions on the basis EMU will go ahead because they &quot; continue to find EMU credible &quot; . 
the greatest impact of that EMU credibility this year was on the lira and peseta government bond markets . 
if both can maintain those yield spread gains and look to add to them in 1997 , Eurobond investors will increasingly be drawn in , syndicate managers said . 
investment in Danish crown Eurobonds may be boosted by a recent government report , dealers said . 
the report forecast the 10-year bond yield gap between it and Germany to fall close to 50 basis points by the end of 1997 and to average below 50 b.p. 
in 1998 . 
the spread has held close to either side of 90 b.p. 
for the past six months . 
worries that have dogged sterling bonds for much of the 1990s -- inflation and the political backdrop -- will remain in place next year . 
inflation , Britain &apos;s perennial problem , has leapt again in recent months , dealing a heavy blow to confidence . 
&quot; The United Kingdom is performing well now but it is a comparatively recent achievement . 
as we look back over the past 20 to 30 years , there &apos;s a credibility problem . 
Britain &apos;s political backdrop -- it must hold a general election by May next year -- was another negative for international investors . 
the incumbent Conservative government is split by in-fighting over Europe and , after losing a string of parliamentary byelections , is struggling to stay in power . 
these difficulties will making the high-yielding pound an obvious candidate for opportunistic retail-targeted deals but an unlikely target for major international Eurobond transactions .
