gold prices slumped to a 12-year low Thursday in late pre-holiday New York trading , leading COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures lower across the board , after news that Australia &apos;s central bank had sold 167 metric tons of gold from reserves in recent months . 
&quot; The Australian disposal was a forward sale arranged some time ago , with only the deliveries occurring now , so you could argue the market has already at least partly discounted it , &quot; Refco New York economist James Steel said . 
&quot; But it confirms that central banks worldwide , not just European central banks , are mobilising their gold reserves to achieve better returns , &quot; he said . 
&quot; So , when no pre-holiday short-covering bounce occurred , funds took the opportunity to sell short again , &quot; he said . 
in the bullion market , spot gold ended quoted $ 325.00 / 50 , after briefly seeing a low at $ 323.70 an ounce , just below a low around $ 325.10 seen in March 1993 . 
the move took spot gold down to its lowest level since early December 1985 , when gold was recovering from a low at $ 281.00 an ounce seen in February 1985 . 
earlier in London , Thursday afternoon gold was fixed at $ 332.55 , compared with the New York close Wednesday around $ 331.10 / 60 . 
COMEX August gold ended down $ 7.10 at $ 325.20 an ounce after hitting a new low of $ 324.00 , led by heavy selling at the close , traders said . 
a strong U.S. dollar and strong U.S. stock market coupled with low inflation have turned investors away from gold since the precious metal reached seven-year highs at $ 417.00 in Febuary 1996 . 
sales of gold by European central banks in 1996 and 1997 have also affected the market , with Belgium confirming a 203-ton sale in March 1996 , and Holland reporting a 300-ton sale in January 1997 , before Thursday &apos;s news of a 167-ton sale by the Reserve Bank of Australia . 
the Australian central bank said it sold the gold over the past six months , with the 125 tons delivered in June , with the balance to be delivered in August and September this year . 
the sales reduced Australia &apos;s gold holdings to 80 tons from 247 tons . 
according to International Monetary Fund data , the Reserve Bank of Australia had $ 14.9 billion in reserves on April 30 . 
Australia produces about 300 metric tons of gold a year , making it the world &apos;s third largest gold producer , after No .
