while the Dow Industrials closed lower amid renewed concern over rising interest rates , resurgent high-tech issues propelled the Nasdaq higher again . 
still riding the wave of Intel Corp &apos;s upbeat forecast at the start of the week , high techs raked in further gains as the Nasdaq resisted the downward pull of strong economic data , which took the steam out of blue chips . 
the Nasdaq composite Index was up 6.38 points , or 0.53 percent , at 1212.09 , even though declining issues led advances by 2046 to 2009 . 
volume was about 572 million shares . 
among the techs moving higher in brisk trading was Iomega Corp , which topped the Nasdaq most active list , rising three to 17-7 / 8 . 
Intel gained 1-3 / 8 to 97 , Microsoft Corp rallied 1-1 / 4 to 137-3 / 4 , and Glenayre Technologies Inc rose 2-1 / 4 at 22-5 / 8 . 
among other Nasdaq gainers , Israel &apos;s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd jumped 3-1 / 2 to 47 after a U.S. Food and Drug Administration panel recommended the approval of its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone .
