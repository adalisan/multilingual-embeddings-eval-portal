France &apos;s grain office ONIC said on Friday it had not processed a single offer to sell grain into intervention stores as the 1996 / 97 season draws to a close . 
ONIC was commenting on the situation as of 1000 GMT on Friday , but farmers can still sell their grain into intervention on May 31 , the expiry date for the season . 
grain dealers said this was not surprising as uncertainties over the fate of the new crop following nearly four months of drought had kept domestic prices in most regions above intervention prices and deterred offers into intervention stores . 
France ended the 1995 / 96 season with 11,000 tonnes of soft wheat and a symbolic one tonne of barley in its intervention stocks , provisional ONIC data show .
