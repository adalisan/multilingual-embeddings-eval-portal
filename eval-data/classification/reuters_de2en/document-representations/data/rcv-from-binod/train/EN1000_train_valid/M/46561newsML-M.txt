U.S. Plains direct cattle Wednesday traded actively at $ 71.00 per cwt , up $ 1.00 from top prices paid last week , feedlot sources said . 
about 40,000 head had traded in the Texas Panhandle / western Oklahoma area by mid-Wednesday afternoon , which could result in a weekly record-large volume when last Friday &apos;s active day is counted in , USDA and market sources said . 
the previous record was 155,400 head set during the week ended Aug 22 of this year . 
Kansas feedlots had sold about 30,000 head , which may keep the weekly figure below the record of 136,400 also set during the week ended Aug 22 , sources there said . 
demand for cattle was strong enought that some cattle feeders reportedly passed packer bids at $ 71.00 in an attempt to get $ 72.00 for their cattle , sources said . 
gains were linked to tight market-ready cattle supplies and strong boxed beef prices . 
boxed beef values just ahead of midday were quoted up $ 0.19 to $ 0.93 per cwt by USDA , on 193 loads of fabricated cuts reported sold . 
prices for heavyweight choice beef have climbed $ 2.34 over the past three business days .
