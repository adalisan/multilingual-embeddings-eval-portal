France deported an asylum-seeker back to his native Mauritania on Thursday despite fears that he could face death on his return , a human rights group said . 
Diade Diarra was flown to Brussels from Orly Airport south of Paris , where he was to be transferred to a flight to the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott , officials of the Paris-based Movement against Racism ( MRAP ) told Reuters . 
Diarra , who was among a group of African immigrants who occupied a Paris church for nearly two months last year in the hope of gaining legal residence in France , was expected to be expelled via Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris . 
officials apparently switched to a flight leaving from Orly airport after demonstrators gathered at Charles de Gaulle to try to physically prevent his departure , a MRAP spokeswoman said . 
Diarra &quot; fears for his life in Mauritania , but he did not refuse to board the flight . 
he said he had had enough , &quot; the spokeswoman said . 
airport police and the interior ministry declined to comment . 
Diarra , a political activist who fled Mauritania in 1989 , has been threatened with death if he returned home , according to French human rights groups . 
more than 200 African immigrants were detained following a police raid last August on the Saint Bernard church in a multi-ethnic Paris neighbourhood , where the immigrants had holed up in a protest against tight French immigration laws . 
most were released after a brief detention and allowed to remain in France legally . 
a small number have since been expelled after being refused legal residence in France . 
a judge in September allowed another Mauritanian in the group , Berke Camara , to stay in France even though his request for asylum had been rejected , on grounds his life would be in danger if he were sent back home .
