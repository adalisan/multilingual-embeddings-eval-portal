Singapore shares finished on a steady note Monday but eased off highs as the market continued to consolidate after recent gains and heavy activity . 
dealers said institutional investors were sidelined and mainly net sellers in Singapore and Malaysian stocks . 
&quot; The market &apos;s in a temporary pause . 
the short-term focus is on relocation of assets in the region , &quot; said a dealer with a foreign securities exchange . 
he said there continued to be an influx of capital from Hong Kong and Thailand . 
the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index was up 3.64 points at 2,256.10 on a volume of 532.5 million shares . 
dealers said retail interest was evident in small issues , warrants and over-the-counter ( OTC ) Malaysian stocks . 
demand for blue chips was partly dampened ahead of the release of the 1996 Annual Economic Survey on Tuesday , while a global telecommunication deregulation pact signed in Geneva on Saturday had scant impact on Singapore &apos;s SingTel stock .
