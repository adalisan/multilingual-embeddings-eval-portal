the Australian dollar spent a news-free session nailed to US $ 0.7480 support Thursday after tentative attempts at a rally were hammered offshore . 
the currency had ventured as high as US $ 0.7530 overnight as a couple of speculators squeezed the market in the hope of popping stop loss bids just above there . 
selling from European and New York banks turned the tables there and proved heavy enough to spark stop loss offers at 75 cents . 
the failure to sustain even so modest a bounce did not bode well for the future , dealers said , and reckoned the three month old downtrend may soon add another cent to its five cent tally . 
the currency was just as subdued on the crosses , taking its cue from US $ / yen which had turned torpid ahead of the weekend meeting of G7 powers in Denver . 
the Japanese trade surplus is likely to feature in the discussions along with its implications for US $ / yen and the market was cautious in case the talks turned acrimonious . 
the A $ eased to 84.78 / 88 yen from an early 84.90 / 00 and 85.27 / 37 and to 56.8 in trade weighted terms from 56.9 . 
a break and close under trendline support around US $ 0.7470 , which stretches back to August last year , would confirm a new phase of the dollar &apos;s downtrend was underway which could see it plumb last year &apos;s depths at 73 cents . 
such a recovery looked doubtful given market supicions the Reserve Bank was set to ease policy again in the next month or so . 
the aggressive nature of the May 23 easing and dour data recently had seen analysts rate the risk of a cut at 65 percent . 
most thought the bank was likely to move following its next monthly board meeting in July 1 although the exact timing was greatly complicated by developments at home and abroad . 
for one thing figures on retail sales and building approvals for May are out on July 2 and it was a shock 1.7 percent slump in sales in April which first alerted the market to the risk of yet another easing . 
and the Federal Reserve held a policy meeting of its own on July 1 and 2 which just might result in a U.S. rate hike . 
such a rise would add to the pressure on the A $ and make it harder for the RBA to cut without risking a collapse in the currency . 
equally , if , as most expected , the Fed stood pat on policy the RBA would have that much more room to ease . 
analysts emphasised that a 0.5 point cut to 5.0 percent would almosty certainly be justified by upcoming inflation data for Q2 on July 23 which should show annual consumer price growth slowing to under 1.0 percent . 
furthermore , the last easing would depress credit charges even more in Q3 and could actually see inflation turn negative . 
such a prospect was certain to fuel pressure for further cuts , in a sort of virtuous -- or vicious if you were a dollar bull -- cycle .
