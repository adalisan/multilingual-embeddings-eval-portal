the Australian bond market could see its first Treasury bond tender of the fiscal year this week , possibly amounting to A $ 600 to A $ 700 million , traders said . 
&quot; It &apos;s about time to get the programme under way with one month already gone , but they ( the Treasury ) aren &apos;t desperate for the funds as yet , so there is a 50 / 50 feel whether they will go this week , &quot; one trader said . 
the Australian Treasury told Reuters last week that with the federal budget out of the way it was likely to come to the market any time soon . 
&quot; There &apos;s a reasonable chance of a tender , and probably in the 2008 stock and a shorter one as well , &quot; another trader added . 
however , a third trader said he was not expecting a tender for another week or two . 
if the Treasury does go ahead this week , details of the offering will be announced at 12.00 p.m. ( 0200 GMT ) today for tender on Tuesday . 
this projection provides scope for a new benchmark line of stock and possibly a 2009 stock . 
funding will again be weighted to the first half of the financial year , and tenders will continue to be held every four to six weeks .
