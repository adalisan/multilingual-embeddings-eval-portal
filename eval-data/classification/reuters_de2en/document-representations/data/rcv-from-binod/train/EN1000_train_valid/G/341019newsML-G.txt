a mother accused of killing her two sons took the witness stand in her own defence on Wednesday and described herself as a loving parent . 
Darlie Routier , 27 , told the jury that she , husband Darin and their sons had enjoyed a normal life before Devon , 6 , and Damon , 5 , were stabbed to death in their Rowlett , Texas , home near Dallas on June 6 . 
&quot; Darin and I spent all of our extra time we had with Devon and Damon . 
( they ) were very much a big part of our lives , &quot; she said . 
Routier , weeping at points , read several entries from her diary in which she talked about how much she loved the boys , including one in which she wrote : &quot; When one of my babies are away , I don &apos;t feel complete . 
prosecutors charged that Routier killed her sons in a fit of rage and depression about her weight problems and family financial difficulties , but she has said that an intruder broke into their home , stabbed the boys and attacked her before fleeing . 
Routier said the prosecution &apos;s contention that she had been depressed to the point of being suicidal in the weeks leading up to the murders was overblown . 
earlier , they showed the jury a May 3 diary entry in which Routier talked about killing herself . 
Routier testified that she had not really meant what she wrote and was embarrassed to discuss it in court , but admitted she had had emotional difficulties . 
I &apos;d been having a few days that were really rough , &quot; she said . 
Prosecutor Greg Davis said in opening arguments that Routier was taking diet pills at the time of the murders . 
Routier also said she and the family housekeeper had seen a black car in the alley near their house the day before the killings and that the housekeeper told her the driver was peering into their garage . 
a neighbour testified earlier that she had seen a similar car parked in the area a week before the murders , but that the driver had sped away when she approached to ask if there was a problem . 
Routier , whose testimony continued on Wednesday afternoon , faces the death penalty if convicted . 
the trial was moved to Kerrville , about 60 miles ( 96 km ) northwest of San Antonio , Texas , because of heavy pre-trial publicity in Dallas .
