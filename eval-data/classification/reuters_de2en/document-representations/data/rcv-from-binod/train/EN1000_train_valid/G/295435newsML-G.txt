world number nine Thomas Enqvist suffered a damaging blow on Thursday in his preparations for next week &apos;s Australian Open when he was sidelined for at least two days because of a badly-infected blister on his hand . 
the 22-year-old Swede has been told by doctors to rest after the swelling spread up his right arm and made it painful for him to swing a racket . 
although the timing of the injury was unfortunate , with the first grand slam of the year four days away , Enqvist remained optimistic that he would take his place at Melbourne Park . 
&quot; It &apos;s very sore , but the main thing is that I &apos;ve got inflammation that goes up through the arm , &quot; Enqvist told reporters after the injury forced him to withdraw from the colonial classic warm-up exibition event at Kooyong . 
&quot; I probably shouldn &apos;t have played yesterday but you want to get some matches before the Australian Open . 
Enqvist sustained the injury four days ago in training and aggravated the problem during his 7-5 6-4 loss to American Michael Chang on Wednesday . 
&quot; I am going to rest and in a couple of days , hopefully , it will be all right and the inflammation in the arm is going away and that is the important thing . 
&quot; The doctor said I should take at least two days off from playing , &quot; said Enqvist , whose place at Kooyong was taken by Australian Scott Draper . 
Enqvist reached the quarter-finals at last year &apos;s Australian Open but the injury has disrupted his preparations this time . 
&quot; It &apos;s better for me if I could play three matches here ( at Kooyong ) but now that is not the case , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I have to think positively and hopefully I can get through the first couple of rounds at the Open and then maybe do well .
