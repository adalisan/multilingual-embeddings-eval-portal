most IMM currency futures eroded further during late trading to finish lower and hugging session lows . 
yen sagged the most , as one fund that was a featured seller during the morning returned and sold between 1,000 and 1,500 more June yen minutes before the close . 
brokers said a U.S. bank sold some 500 nearby yen late as well . 
but activity in most other units stayed subdued as they slowly slunk lower in sympathy with yen , after currencies in general showed muted reaction for the day to the sharp pullback and subsequent loss-cutting in U.S. stocks . 
&quot; It &apos;s ( dollar ) holding its own , &quot; said one floor broker when the Dow Jones Industrial average had fallen more than 100 points Wednesday . 
&quot; It &apos;s looking pretty good . 
futures also glossed over afternoon remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , with traders saying his comments contained nothing new or unexpected . 
Rubin reiterated that the United States has had a strong dollar for quite some time , that U.S. economic fundamentals are good and that he sees continued low inflation . 
earlier televised remarks by economist Fred Bergsten briefly helped yen reduce losses but had fleeting impact . 
Bergsten said U.S. Treasury was implicitly calling for a stronger yen , that yen was too weak and the dollar too strong . 
despite the extent of yen &apos;s loss , most units simply gave back the bulk of Tuesday &apos;s gains in what some brokers called a technically oriented trade and position adjustment before U.S. March jobs data due Friday and Rubin &apos;s Tokyo visit . 
even June yen posted only an inside day compared to Tuesday &apos;s even-broader range . 
nearby yen also simply returned to the top portion of Monday &apos;s comparatively tight price band , which spanned $ 0.008190 to $ 0.008141 , brokers noted . 
yen fell early after a mixed Bank of Japan March Tankan diffusion index which analysts said suggested no Japanese rate hike soon . 
June yen ended down $ 0.000127 at $ 0.008195 , marks lost $ 0.0049 to $ 0.5991 , Swiss francs fell $ 0.0020 to $ 0.6979 , sterling dropped $ 0.0110 to $ 1.6416 , Canadian dollar rose $ 0.0010 to $ 0.7247 , Aussie dollar lost $ 0.0016 to $ 0.7834 , and the Mexican peso dropped $ 0.000500 to $ 0.121775 .
