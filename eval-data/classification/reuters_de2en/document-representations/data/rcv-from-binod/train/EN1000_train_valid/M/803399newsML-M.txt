Swedish debt yields shrugged a fall in U.S. yields overnight and were flat at midday Friday while the crown firmed . 
yields opened a couple of basis points lower but soon came back up following the weaker German market . 
&quot; We are following and underperforming Germany . 
we have widened the German spread to 92 from 87 basis points over the week , &quot; one chief dealer said . 
dealers expected little movement today as no important statistics were due and with a lot of markets closed , such as Italy and France . 
&quot; I think the German bunds will decide how the Swedish market closes , &quot; he added . 
the crown firmed to 4.3530 to the mark versus 4.3615 crowns late Thursday . 
&quot; I think the crown is looking for a range in which to consolidate but I don &apos;t think it will go under 4.30 , &quot; said one dealer who was eyeing a range between 4.34 and 4.37 . 
the six month T-bill rate and the ten-year bond yield were unchanged at 4.33 percent and 6.59 percent respectively . 
unemployment figures from Sweden Statistics are due at 1100 GMT with the market expecting a rise to 9.1 percent from 8.8 percent in June .
