call trading in options on June BTP futures dominated Italian debt options activity on Wednesday as the market shrugged off the country &apos;s political turmoil , traders on LIFFE said . 
BTP futures broke out of a range , slicing through resistance around 127.40 to push through the 128.00 barrier . 
by 1415 GMT they were trading up 81 basis points at 127.85 , off an earlier high of 128.08 
&quot; We were stuck in a range in the morning and BTPs are now following up the technical break , &quot; said a trader at a French brokerage . 
implied volatility spiked up to 8.30 / 8.44 percent for the June 127.50 straddle compared with 8.20 percent earlier in the day . 
the 128.00 strike was trading at a volatility of 8.0 percent , up 0.2 percent on the day . 
the trader said it was the 130.00 strike June calls that had attracted most market interest . 
more than 5,100 , mostly traded in 1,000 lots , had been traded by 1415 GMT . 
volatility at that strike flicked up to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent earlier . 
traders said overall BTP volatilities were 0.5 percent higher than a week ago . 
although traders said they were keeping an eye on the Italian domestic scene , there were few signs that the market would turn negative on it . 
Italy &apos;s Prime Minister Romano Prodi put his job on the line earlier on the issue of sending Italian-led security forces to Albania . 
he said he would ask Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to decide his fate if coalition partner the Communist Refoundation party deserted him in Wednesday &apos;s vote , expected around 1800 GMT . 
&quot; There &apos;s a lot of good feeling about BTPs , and Albania isn &apos;t going to derail that , &quot; said a trader at a U.S. bank . 
&quot; The domestic issues such as pensions and the Maastricht criteria are of far more interest . 
on the put side , the 125.00 strike took the lion &apos;s share of trade . 
around 3,500 lots were traded with about 1,600 at the 127.50 strike .
