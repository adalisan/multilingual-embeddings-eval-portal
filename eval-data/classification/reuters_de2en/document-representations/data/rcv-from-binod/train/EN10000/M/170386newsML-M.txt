the Federal Reserve is expected to add reserves into the banking system Wednesday , as today is the final day of the two-week maintenance period and the Fed faces a substantial add need . 
analysts forecast a round of overnight system repurchase agreements . 
the market is anticipating the action at any time this morning , given the Fed has entered the open market ahead of its usual 1130 est / 1630 intervetion time . 
also , the market also awaits a possible bill pass this session , as the add need jumps in the next reserve period . 
the Fed stayed out of the market the first two days of the week , perplexing analysts who projected at least a $ 5 billion a day add need in the period ending today . 
but Fed funds have been soft those days , allowing the Fed to sit on the sidelines . 
that was not the case Wednesday . 
funds shot up to 10 percent late Tuesday , opened at 5-1 / 2 percent this morning and have continued to climb to 5-9 / 16 percent . 
&quot; The tightness in funds ... suggests the Fed has fallen well behind on its add job , &quot; said one analyst , noting the Fed stayed out of the market earlier in the week . 
he added that the may have to come in early &quot; to make sure there is sufficient collateral for the RP . 
meanwhile , the market looks for a bill pass this session , as the add need jumps above $ 7.5 billion a day in the period beginning Thursday . 
&quot; There &apos;s a 50-50 shot they come in this week , &quot; said Marc Wanshel , Fed watcher at J.P. Morgan &amp; Co , adding that it may not happen today , &quot; but that &apos;s the best bet .
