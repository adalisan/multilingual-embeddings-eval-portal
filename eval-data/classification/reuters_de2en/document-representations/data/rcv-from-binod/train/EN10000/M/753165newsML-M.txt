strong gasoline demand pushed oil refining margins up last week , with improvements in California and the East Coast leading the way , according to a report by Salomon Inc oil analyst Paul Ting . 
the U.S. average moved up to $ 4.11 per barrel as of last Friday from $ 3.90 in the previous week . 
California posted the largest gain , up 60 cents to $ 4.38 , Ting &apos;s report said . 
firming gasoline prices , fueled in part by tightness in markets for the additive MTBE ( methyl tertiary butyl ether ) , helped margins on the East Coast rise by 39 cents to $ 3.65 per barrels . 
but Ting said the West Coast change was fueled by the recent exceptional movement of cargoes of refined product to the Gulf Coast , where prices are fetching an atypically high premium compared with those in California . 
&quot; In California ( the margin improvement ) is structural , &quot; Ting told Reuters , noting that product cargoes usually move from the Gulf to California , where a producton shortfall means prices typically are much higher . 
Week-on-week margins at the Gulf Coast , home of the world &apos;s biggest refinery infrastructure , improved by 16 cents to $ 3.85 a gallon . 
Midwest refining margins meanwhile ticked up just a cent at the end of last week to $ 4.84 per barrel . 
margins on the West Coast as a whole rose last week by 10 cents to $ 3.61 . 
whether the movement of gasoline to Houston from California starts putting pressure on Gulf margins and marks the beginning of improvement on the West Coast is far too early to tell , Ting said . 
&quot; There are too many other variables , &quot; Ting said , including among those maintenance schedules in the two refining centers . 
what is clearer than the future outlook for margins is how deteriorating margins on the West Coast have opened the arbitrage window for the movement of refined products to Houston from California , Ting said . 
during the second quarter , Gulf Coast margins rose solidly by 52 cents to $ 2.44 cents on the heels of a winter of disappointing heating oil demand . 
but over the same period margins in California fell by $ 1.74 to $ 5.62 a barrel , Ting &apos;s report said .
