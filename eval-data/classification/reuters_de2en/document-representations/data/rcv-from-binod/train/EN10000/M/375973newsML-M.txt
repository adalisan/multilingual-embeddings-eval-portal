Dutch shares ended at a fresh record close on Thursday , the fifth AEX record in a row . 
dealers said trade was dominated by professional traders , but also pointed to growing retail interest . 
trade focused on Royal Dutch and Philips which both released their annual results in the morning . 
Royal Dutch , which announced a four-for-one share split , also dominated options trade . 
the shares added 11.70 guilders to close at 347.50 . 
&quot; The figures were just fabulous , the split is great . 
nobody expected things to be this good , &quot; one dealer said . 
Philips , which reported a Q4 loss , dipped in the morning but soon recovered to end at 81.00 guilders , up 2.90 from Wednesday &apos;s close . 
dealers pointed out the large size of many deals , suggesting the major buyers of the stock were likely foreign parties . 
&quot; Besides , no Dutch investor would buy the stock at these levels . 
anybody following the company knows it &apos;s bad stuff , &quot; one dealer said , adding his analyst agreed . 
another said buyers returned after the analyst meeting . 
&quot; I heard some very positive echoes of the meeting , &quot; he said . 
one trader attributed the rise to the Boonstra effect . 
&quot; He &apos;s a very good speaker , convincing people his reorganisations are going to work out fine , &quot; she said . 
good sentiment towards the semiconductor sector led computer software Baan 5.20 guilders higher to 93.70 , while ASM International added 1.50 guilders to 31.50 guilders . 
however , one dealer played down the rise . 
&quot; Those semis are hocus pocus to me . 
put it all in a pot and start mixing . 
tomorrow the shares might just as well lose double the amount they gained today , &quot; he said . 
Polygram , which released figures on Wednesday , ended down 2.40 guilders at 86.10 on disappointment that Philips has no plans to shed its 75 percent stake in the company . 
shares of food group Nutricia ended 3.40 guilders higher at 277.40 . 
dealers attributed the rise to the end of the salmonella scare concerning the company &apos;s baby food .
