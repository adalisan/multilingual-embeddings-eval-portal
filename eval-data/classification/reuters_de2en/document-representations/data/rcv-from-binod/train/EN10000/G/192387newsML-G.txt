China launched the contest to pick Hong Kong &apos;s future leader on Friday , hailing the event as the birth of &quot; real democracy &quot; in the British-ruled territory which is set to revert to Beijing &apos;s control next year . 
but pro-democracy protesters disagreed -- they stormed into the building where Hong Kong &apos;s rich and mighty had gathered to vote , and , waving imitation black coffins , they denounced the exercise as the death of freedom . 
only 400 of Hong Kong &apos;s 6.3 million people are participating in the voting , having joined a special Selection Committee set up under China &apos;s close supervision . 
shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa and his principal rival , former Chief Justice Ti Liang Yang both scored more than the minimum of 50 votes required to reach the next leg of the contest to select the first post-colonial Chief Executive . 
Tung took a commanding lead with 206 votes . 
also through to round two is businessman Peter woo , but five contenders including former appeals court judge Simon Li fell out of the race . 
the run-off will be on December 11 . 
the gathering of the Selection Committee , inaugurated by China &apos;s Foreign Minister Qian Qichen , who was visiting the territory for the first time , was marred by scuffles when pro-democracy activists clashed with police . 
a dozen demonstrators scrambled into the plush Hong Kong Convention Centre in an unsuccessful bid to disrupt the historic meeting . 
police chased protesters up six floors of escalators before they were rounded up and detained . 
outside , a police officer received a bloody nose and three more demonstrators were carted away in scuffles between about 40 activists and 100 police . 
in his inauguration speech Qian declared the selection process as the dawn of genuine democracy in Hong Kong . 
&quot; For Hong Kong &apos;s people to elect their own chief executive , that is something unprecedented in Hong Kong &apos;s history , &quot; he said . 
&quot; For some 150 years Britain has appointed 20 or so Hong Kong governors , and when were the views of Hong Kong people ever consulted ? 
&quot; Qian asked the assembled caucus . 
&quot; The establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) is the start of real democracy in Hong Kong , and not the end of democracy in Hong Kong , &quot; he said . 
Hong Kong reverts to China at midnight next June 30 . 
Tung , 59 , Yang , 67 , and woo , 50 , are now the only hopefuls left in the race , and Qian was at pains to stress that despite claims by critics that the winner had been chosen in advance by China &apos;s communist rulers , the result was not preordained . 
the democracy activists brandished posters of jailed Chinese dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng and banners condemning China &apos;s plan to replace Hong Kong &apos;s elected legislature . 
&quot; Free Wang Dan , release Wei Jingsheng , oppose the provisional legislature &quot; , they shouted through loudhailers . 
the democracy lobby brands the leadership race undemocratic and has campaigned against the provisional legislature . 
&quot; The provisional legislature is a great step backwards for democracy , &quot; one protest banner said on Friday . 
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind warned China on Thursday its plans for a provisional legislature risked creating &quot; confusion and uncertainty &quot; in Hong Kong . 
&quot; China would have to explain to Hong Kong and the world why they had chosen to replace a body for which more than a million Hong Kong people voted by one chosen by a handpicked electorate of only 400 , &quot; he told a parliamentary debate in London .
