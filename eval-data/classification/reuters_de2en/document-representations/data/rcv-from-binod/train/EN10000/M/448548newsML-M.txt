Indosuez W.I. 
Carr Securities is positive about the Thai and Singapore stock markets in the medium term but sees weakness in the Philippines and Indonesia , group regional strategist David Scott said on Monday . 
speaking to reporters at the company &apos;s first emerging markets conference for fund managers , Scott said he would overweight the Thai stock market , which had become very cheap . 
there is much more bad news to come and I will get even more bullish as they come out , &quot; he said . 
the Thai stock market index has fallen by half since the middle of 1996 due mainly to failures in the property and finance sectors . 
Scott said the government had &quot; underwritten the Thai financial system &quot; with its plan to issue bonds to buy non-performing loans from finance companies and banks . 
&quot; Thailand &apos;s credit is still good . 
the big Thai borrowers are still able to borrow at quite fine rates abroad , &quot; he said . 
Scott said he believed most of the bad news yet to come out of Thailand had already been discounted in the markets . 
he said investors should look to pick up small and medium sized corporations outside the finance and property sectors . 
Scott said that although the Philippines had good economic fundamentals in place , he &quot; would be much more cautious in the Philippines than in Thailand &quot; . 
he said the Philippine banking system had grown very quickly and credit growth in the private sector was up 56 percent in 1996 . 
&quot; That has to slow , &quot; he said . 
&quot; And when that happens , markets in the Philippines are not going to do particularly well in the next few years . 
the problem in Indonesia was that stocks were expensive with earnings growth slowing sharply , he said . 
Scott said he expected earnings per share growth in 1997 for Indonesian companies to be half of that of 1995 , mainly due to increased competition from foreign companies and over-expansion by local firms . 
while such a development would be good for Indonesia in the longer term , it made the market look expensive and susceptible to downward pressure in the near term , he said . 
Scott said he was positive about the results Singapore companies had released so far for 1996 . 
he said the outlook for the Singapore economy was good and that funds had too little exposure in Singapore .
