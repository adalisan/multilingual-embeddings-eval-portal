U.S. debt futures finished the quiet session mixed after some contracts drifted up late in the day on shortcovering before key data Friday . 
&quot; We traded mostly at 107-7 / 32 to 9 / 32 during the day but short locals bid it up into the close , &quot; one Treasury bond futures source said of June T-bonds . 
retail sales were expected up 0.6 percent and up 0.4 percent excluding autos . 
PPI dropped 0.4 percent overall and 0.1 percent excluding food and energy in the previous report . 
retail sales grew 0.8 percent overall and 0.5 percent excluding autos in the last report . 
early on Thursday , debt futures gleaned brief support from a rise in the latest weekly jobless claims , but trading overall remained rangebound . 
claims rose to 318,000 in the April 5 week from a revised 312,000 in the prior week . 
a spate of speeches by U.S. and Federal Reserve officials lent little direction to prices either , traders said . 
technicians eyed what they called good resistance between 107-22 / 32 and 107-28 / 32 in June T-bonds -- an area that saw seven consecutive session highs in the last two weeks . 
they put support at 107-00 . 
in the short end , traders called the market tightly bound to its recent range . 
one Eurodollar trader pegged support in September Euros at 93.69 and 93.71 , with resistance at 93.75 . 
&quot; After the sell-off people squared up ahead of tomorrow , &quot; one Euro broker said . 
&quot; We finished on a relatively strong note , but we &apos;re still playing it that you sell any pop you get , &quot; he said . 
indeed , many said an intermediate term downtrend was still intact , with targets in the upper 106-00 handle and at 105-20 / 32 , the September 5 session low . 
another Euro trader noted a U.S. bank bought up to 7,000 September / September 1997 spreads , but said overall , action was light .
