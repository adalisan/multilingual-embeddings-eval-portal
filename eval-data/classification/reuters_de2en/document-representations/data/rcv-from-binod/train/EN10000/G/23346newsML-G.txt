Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has approved plans , frozen by the previous Labour government , to build more homes in existing Jewish settlements in the West Bank , his spokesman said on Thursday . 
the spokesman , Avi Benayahu , declined to say how many housing units would be built . 
Israeli media reports put the number at between 2,000 and 3,550 . 
&quot; The minister approved a number of construction plans in existing settlements . 
these are building plans which had been approved in the past by the ( Labour ) government and later frozen , &quot; Benayahu said in a statement . 
Mordechai &apos;s decision was certain to anger Palestinians , who observed a strike called by President Yasser Arafat in the West Bank and Gaza on Thursday to protest against the right-wing Israeli government &apos;s policies on settlements and Jerusalem . 
Israel &apos;s opposition Labour party condemned the planned construction , saying the Likud-led government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was sending the wrong message to the PLO . 
&quot; The ( government &apos;s ) provocation of the Palestinians is clear , &quot; former tourism minister Uzi Baram told Israel Radio . 
&quot; It is playing with a powder keg that puts all of us in great danger . 
the Maariv newspaper said Israel would add 700 housing units to the settlement of Kiryat Sefer , 1,050 to Hashmonaim , 900 to a nearby Jewish seminary , 200 to Matityahu and 700 to Betar Ilit . 
all are in the West Bank , near the pre-1967 Middle East war border . 
Israel Radio put the number of new homes at 2,000 . 
Benayahu said Mordechai &apos;s approval was in line with the decision by the Netanyahu government to cancel the previous administration &apos;s building freeze in the West Bank . 
Israel &apos;s announcement on Tuesday of a plan to build a new neighbourhood in Kiryat Sefer sparked accusations from Arafat on Wednesday that the Jewish state was declaring war on Palestinians . 
Netanyahu &apos;s government , which took office in June , lifted a freeze on Jewish settlement building in the West Bank and Gaza Strip imposed by the Labour government in 1992 . 
Palestinians want to establish an independent state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . 
some 130,000 Jews have settled amidst the nearly two million Palestinians in the territories since Israel captured them in the 1967 Middle East war . 
Israel &apos;s Housing Ministry said on August 20 that it was drafting a plan to approve construction of 5,000 new homes in the West Bank .
