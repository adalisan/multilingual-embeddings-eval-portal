Tony Blair calls him &quot; spellbinding &quot; . 
Peter Thomson , the priest often described as the British prime minister &apos;s spiritual guru , prefers to be called simply a friend . 
Thomson , who met Blair when he was a fresh-faced student at Oxford University , holds the key to unlocking the soul behind the politician who led Labour to a sweeping election victory on May 1 . 
Thomson , now 61 , is credited with introducing the young Blair to the brand of Christian socialism that permeates his vision of a nation in which the have-nots can become the haves and where the interests of the community triumph over greed and selfishness . 
&quot; He &apos;s one of the most inspiring people I have ever met in my life . 
he &apos;s a muscular Christian . 
tough . 
courageous , &quot; Blair once said of the relaxed Australian Anglican . 
through force of habit or political expediency born of Labour &apos;s 18 years in the wilderness , Blair rarely lets down his guard to reveal the man within . 
but the 44-year-old brings an evangelising zeal to his public life unusual in Britain where religion has long been regarded as an unsuitable bedfellow for politics . 
he credits Thomson with helping to make sense of his nominal religious beliefs when he was a young law student . 
&quot; Peter made it ( religion ) relevant , practical rather than theological , &quot; Blair recalled . 
the two met in the early 1970s when Blair was in his first year at Oxford and Thomson , a priest and mature student 18 years his senior , was studying theology there . 
&quot; He was young , full of life , a person who had this joie de vivre . 
he &apos;d a keen intellect and a sense of compassion for other people , &quot; Thomson said of the teenage Blair . 
Blair &apos;s early life lacked purpose . 
he enjoyed life at Oxford , playing in a rock band . 
but &quot; beyond getting a degree I don &apos;t think he knew what he was doing at Oxford , &quot; Thomson said . 
after 18 months of putting the world to rights in long late-night discussions , Blair was quietly confirmed as a Christian although for years even most of his friends knew little of his religious beliefs . 
Blair is an Anglican but is married to a Catholic , lawyer Cherie , and regularly attends mass with his children . 
Blair &quot; came out &quot; in the religious sense only a year ago in a newspaper article littered with references to Kant and Kierkegaard in which he wrote of his mission to restore Christian morality to socialism . 
back in 1973 , Thomson had introduced Blair to the work of an obscure 1930s Scottish philosopher called John McMurray who believed that the &quot; noblest form of human existence is friendship &quot; . 
the importance of the community as a place in which people are committed to the welfare of one another , rather than the needs of the individual , convinced Blair that it was possible to act politically from a religious base . 
Thomson , a rugged man with the typical Australian classlessness that Britons find so refreshing , dislikes the guru tag . 
&quot; We were friends and we were all searching for a faith that dealt with reality , not just an airy-fairy spiritual thing , &quot; said Thomson . 
in 1974 , Thomson returned to Australia to take up a job as headmaster of the exclusive Timbertop school , while Blair started work as a lawyer by day and a Labour Party activist by night . 
but the two remained close friends , despite the vast physical distances and the different paths taken by their careers . 
they exchanged visits and in 1990 -- four years before becoming leader of the Labour Party -- Blair took his friend and now finance minister Gordon Brown over to meet Thomson in Australia . 
he has also met some of Blair &apos;s other political friends but is careful to keep his distance . 
our perspectives are different and I don &apos;t understand the political machinery , &quot; he said . 
things changed after Blair became party leader in 1994 . 
Thomson returned to England in 1996 to work as a priest in the tough inner city London parish of Holloway -- a short distance from the fashionable district of Islington inhabited by the Blairs . 
Tony had become a leader , things were happening and I wanted to be part of it , &quot; he said . 
to deduce that would be quite wrong . 
nothing has given me greater pleasure than to witness how beautifully he has developed in his own right , &quot; Thomson said .
