the World Bank said on Wednesday Zimbabwe had made &quot; some impressive &quot; progress in reducing its budget deficit but said release of crucial balance of payments support would await further progress on the budget . 
David Cook , the World Bank &apos;s representative in Zimbabwe , told reporters that the bank was also waiting for the government to finalise a new five-year economic reform programme before making this decision . 
&quot; We &apos;re impressed by government efforts to make sure that the budget deficit goes down . 
we are impressed by what &apos;s going on . 
one needs to get the deficit down to a level that &apos;s sustainable and we &apos;re not yet there , &quot; he said at the end of two-day annual aid talks . 
the talks culminated in an agreement between the two parties on a standard development aid programme aimed largely at reducing poverty in the southern African country .
