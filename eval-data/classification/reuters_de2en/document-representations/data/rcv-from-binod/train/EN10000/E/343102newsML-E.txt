Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Thursday said that while it is important for Congress to allot more money for the improvement of the Consumer Price Index , it should not dictate the means for making such improvements . 
responding to a question following testimony to the Senate Finance Committee , Greenspan said that experts at the Labor Department &apos;s Bureau of Labor Statistics already know the technical adjustments that need to be made to the CPI . 
providing the agency with specific instructions would be inappropriate , Greenspan said . 
&quot; Giving them instructions would indeed be a political fix , &quot; he said . 
in his formal testimony to the panel , Greenspan recommended allocating more money to the BLS as part of a &quot; two track &quot; approach to resolving problems stemming from the CPI &apos;s overstatement of inflation . 
he also suggested that an independent commission be established that could determine biases in the CPI that the BLS was unable to fix . 
that commission could then recommend appropriate levels of indexing for federal benefit programs and taxes . 
Greenspan and others who believe the CPI overstates inflation have said the problem should be corrected because it is costing the federal government a lot of money each year . 
that results from overpayment in benefits such as Social Security and in a loss of tax revenue due to improper indexing of tax brackets , they have said .
