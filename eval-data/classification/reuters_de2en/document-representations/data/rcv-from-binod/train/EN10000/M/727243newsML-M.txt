bonds eased with Europe after the results of the three , five and 10 year bond auctions had been less aggressive than many expected . 
yields at the 10 year sale were slightly higher than forecast . 
nevertheless , traders said that the spread with the Bund might narrow slightly , if Europe continues weak , because the better than expected inflation figures for June would lend support to the local market . 
the year-on-year inflation rate dipped to 1.8 percent after analysts had been expecting between two and 2.4 percent . 
&quot; The ( June ) inflation is not going to allow the long end to fall as far as the Bund and could tighten the spread , &quot; said one trader . 
the shorter end of the curve remains well supported . 
banks bid defensively at the auction , calculating that the Public Credit Institute ( IGCP ) would be prepared to pay because it needed funds . 
but that was not what happened , traders said . 
it only placed some six billion escudos at the short end because it did not agree with the yields bid . 
it knows that the Bank of Portugal has ample room to cut rates ( further ) this year , &quot; said one trader .
