the Kenyan shilling opened steady on Wednesday , but commercial bank dealers said the unit was still suffering from news the World Bank was contemplating halting aid to Kenya . 
commercial banks posted an unchanged mean rate of 70.04 against the dollar . 
&quot; The shilling is still showing signs of weakness . 
you know the news by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has sent bad signals to investors , &quot; a senior dealer from a leading commercial bank said . 
the shilling has been under severe pressure since the IMF , citing concerns on graft and governance , put its aid package to Kenya on hold . 
on Tuesday , the shilling opened at an official record low against the dollar after the World Bank , followed the IMF example , said it delayed part of a loan package and would find it hard to hand over the money until the Kenyan government addressed issues raised by the IMF . 
the previous official low was touched last Thursday after the IMF cancelled a key aid package .
