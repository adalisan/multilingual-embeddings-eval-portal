the number of people acquiring French citizenship in 1995 was 27 percent lower than the figure for the previous year , the Justice Ministry said on Friday . 
the 92,140 individuals to become citizens represented a &quot; return to normal &quot; from a peak of 126,337 recorded for 1994 , the ministry said . 
it added that 51 percent of the 1995 total were from a European state and 46 percent were from northern Africa . 
immigration and the right to citizenship have become highly controversial issues in France . 
unemployment is at a record 12.7 percent and the far-right anti-immigrant National Front has gained strength in by-elections . 
the National Assembly has approved and sent to the Senate a measure that would further tighten France &apos;s already tough laws against immigration .
