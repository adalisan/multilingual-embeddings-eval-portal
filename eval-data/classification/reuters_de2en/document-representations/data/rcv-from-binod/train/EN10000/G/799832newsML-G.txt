ten Italians , including a nine-year-old boy , have been abducted in two incidents in Yemen , the Italian Foreign Ministry said on Thursday . 
a ministry official said a first group of six people was kidnapped in the south of the country on Wednesday afternoon while on their way to Al Mukallaa on the Gulf of Aden coast . 
they had been taken to the interior of Yemen . 
&quot; We have spoken to one of them and they are well , they are being treated well , &quot; he told Reuters . 
the group consisted of one family with a nine-year-old son and another with a daughter whose age was not yet known . 
earlier reports from security and diplomatic sources in the capital Sanaa had said five or six European tourists , either Germans or Italians , were kidnapped by tribesmen while on a tour in the Abyan governate and taken to Shabwa in central Yemen . 
the ministry official in Rome said four more Italians were kidnapped near Khamir , some 100 km ( 60 miles ) north of Sanaa , on Thursday morning , but he had no further details . 
the incident was the third involving Italians in recent weeks in Yemen , one of the Arab world &apos;s poorest countries . 
an Italian kidnapped by tribesmen earlier in August was released last Sunday after five days and two others were abducted in late July and freed after one day . 
in March , four German holidaymakers were kidnapped . 
earlier that month a group of seven German motorcycle tourists was also abducted . 
kidnapping is a common tactic by Yemeni tribes holding grievances against the government or foreign oil firms operating in Yemen , located in the southwest of the Arabian peninsula . 
Tribesmen have tried to use hostages -- who have included French and U.S. diplomats and a Saudi ambassador -- as bargaining chips in land and water disputes . 
all hostages have been released unharmed so far . 
Giorgio Bonanomi , the 49-year-old Italian released last Sunday , said he was never afraid and had been treated throughout very well , adding that it was an enjoyable cultural experience .
