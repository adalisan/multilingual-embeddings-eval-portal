the Bulgarian National Bank ( BNB ) has written to the prime minister proposing setting up a group of international experts to evaluate alternatives to a currency board proposed by the IMF . 
&quot; We do not reject the options proposed by the IMF , but we believe that all possible alternatives should be sought ... for the most competent solution regarding Bulgaria &apos;s economy and monetary system , &quot; said the letter made available to Reuters . 
an International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) team has met senior government officials , politicians and bankers in the past week to discuss introducing a currency board to curb inflation and restore confidence in the Lev . 
Prime Minister Zhan Videnov told a meeting of his ruling Socialist party on Monday night he supported introduction of a currency board as the only way to stabilise the economy by preventing the BNB from pouring money into refinancing of collapsing banks or fuelling inflation by printing money . 
under the currency board system , the amount of national currency in circulation must be exactly matched by the central bank &apos;s hard currency reserves . 
currency boards , pegging the local currency usually to the dollar , have been used by Argentina , Estonia , Lithuania and Latvia to restore confidence and help defeat hyperinflation . 
&quot; The introduction of a currency board at this moment would hardly resolve the complicated problems of Bulgaria &apos;s financial system without a previous restructuring , &quot; said the letter , which was also addressed to the president and speaker of parliament . 
under the currency board proposal , the central bank would be reduced to the currency board , reponsible for the issuance of the Lev and for foreign exchange , and a banking department , responsible for banking supervision . 
Bulgaria is caught in a vicious circle between lack of popular confidence in the Lev and higher interest rates that the budget can not afford , said Deputy Director of the IMF European Department , Michael Deppler in a recent interview . 
he said that in terms of monetary arrangements , the alternatives to a currency board are floating exchange rates and a fixed exchange rate , both of which usually entail higher interest rates and are no longer applicable to Bulgaria , which has a floating rate now . 
the IMF has not said how much support it would provide if a currency board plan was adopted but urged the government to draft the 1997 budget focusing on the requirements of the currency board . 
new IMF missions are expected to come to discuss technical aspects of the implementation of a currency board in the next few weeks while the debate continues . 
implementation would have to be approved by parliament , in which Videnov &apos;s Socialist party has a majority . 
Deppler said in the interview that the Fund &apos;s reform programme in Bulgaria had failed so far . 
the IMF has twice postponed a $ 115 million loan due to Bulgaria &apos;s failure to meet reform targets which include curbing inflation , stabilising the exchange rate , speeding up privatisation and closing loss-making enterprises .
