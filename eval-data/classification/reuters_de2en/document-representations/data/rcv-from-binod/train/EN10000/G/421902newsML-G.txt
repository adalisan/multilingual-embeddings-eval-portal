people given temporary protection in a European Union country after fleeing problems back home should be given the right to work , send their children to school and have babies , the European Commission said on Wednesday . 
spurred on by the lack of a coordinated EU response when 800,000 people fled Bosnia to seek protection in the bloc , the Commission said the EU should adopt a joint action on temporary protection , guaranteeing basic rights . 
&quot; I do not think that what happened in Bosnia is going to be the last phenomenon of that kind , &quot; Justice Commissioner Anita Gradin told a news conference . 
the proposal is not likely to affect any outflow of people from the Balkan state of Albania , mired in violent unrest , as it must be approved by the justice and home affairs council ministers and it will not be discussed by them until the end of May , Gradin said . 
the Commission intends the proposal to complement rather than replace the 1951 Geneva convention on the status of refugees under which asylum seekers must be examined on a case by case basis by the host country . 
when the number of asylum seekers is so great in a crisis that this kind of individual vetting is not realistic , and member states resort to temporary protection measures and at present each has different approaches . 
in Denmark and Greece for example , people given temporary shelter have no possibility to work , while they can work in Sweden . 
in Finland they are entitled to unemployment benefits . 
in Denmark , Greece and Luxembourg there is no right for a person to reunite their family , while the right does exist in Belgium and Ireland . 
in Italy they have no right to social assistance , while France and Portugal have no official arrangement for giving their children schooling . 
once agreed the EU would set up a joint decision-making mechanism for opening up , prolonging and phasing out a temporary protection regime . 
under the proposal , the first for an EU instrument in the asylum field , the EU executive would every year report on the situation in refugees &apos; country of origin as well as in each EU member state . 
the Commission said it wanted to set a minimum threshold for basic rights and benefits for the people under protection . 
&quot; They should be able to support themselves , be able to reunite their immediate family at least , send their children to school , &quot; Gradin said .
