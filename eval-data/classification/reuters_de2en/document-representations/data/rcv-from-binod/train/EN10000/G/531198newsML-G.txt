Nantes &apos; coach Jean-Claude Suaudeau has mixed emotions about the possibility of European competition next season . 
since a dismal opening spell of 10 matches without victory , Nantes have rallied to third place and are now on the threshold of taking the second French spot in the European Cup next season . 
&quot; We want Europe , be it the UEFA Cup or the European Cup but we &apos;re not the only candidates , &quot; Suaudeau said . 
&quot; If Monaco weren &apos;t so far off , Nantes would dream of the title . 
but Suaudeau is not convinced that two teams should qualify for Europe &apos;s most prestigious trophy . 
&quot; For me , it &apos;s ( only ) the champions who should take part in the Champions &apos; League , not the runners-up , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t feel we were champions if eventually we took part . 
this second qualifying place is a question of money . 
let sports people make no mistake about that . 
Nantes &apos; steady climb up the first division table has been remarkable in a rebuilt side after the departure of half the 1995 championship team . 
&quot; After 10 matches it was totally unreasonable to dream of ( Europe ) , &quot; he said . 
now unbeaten in 26 league matches , Nantes have suffered one defeat since October when they crashed to third division Vitrolles in the French Cup in January . 
&quot; After 20 ( games ) , Europe became visible and now , five games from the finish , it &apos;s there , more than ever , &quot; Suaudeau said . 
Suaudeau warned that down to seventh-placed defending champions Auxerre there are five teams in line for four places in Europe , three in the UEFA Cup , after Strasbourg &apos;s qualification as League Cup winners . 
and although Nantes &apos; goal difference is second only to Monaco &apos;s he does not believe his side &apos;s current form , particularly away , is any guarantee of success . 
&quot; On our last seven trips away we &apos;ve taken 19 out of a possible 21 points , but still we &apos;re going to have to work . 
Suaudeau said if the French first division had dropped in quality , it was due not so much to the exodus of many top players but rather because there was so much at stake , especially at the bottom with four teams facing relegation . 
&quot; We &apos;re playing longer ( balls ) this season , we &apos;re bypassing the midfield and the game &apos;s suffering , it &apos;s less attractive . 
at Nantes , that &apos;s not our style ... but we &apos;ve had to adapt . 
he said his team &apos;s poor start to the season had been due both to a lack of proper preparation , interrupted by the Intertoto Cup , and a change in the way most of the teams in the first division were playing . 
first I had to realise this and then stick more to the reality , &quot; he said . 
the net result is a season divided into three distinct stages . 
the first , the opening 10 games in which Nantes picked up only five points , was followed by a spell of high scoring . 
starting with their first victory of the season , 7-0 at home against Nice in October , they hit 31 goals in 11 games . 
the third stage has seen them become almost impregnable in defence , conceding three goals in 12 matches while scoring 12 . 
&quot; Three months ago we were scoring a lot of goals . 
now , we don &apos;t concede any . 
apart from the goal we conceded to Marseille ( in the final minute to draw 1-1 ) , we are hyper-effective , &quot; he Suaudeau said .
