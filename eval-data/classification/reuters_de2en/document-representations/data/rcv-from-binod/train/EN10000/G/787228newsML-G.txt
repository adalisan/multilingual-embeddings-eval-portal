Zhanna Pintussevich ended Merlene Ottey &apos;s four-year reign as world 200 metres champion on Friday then expressed astonishment that she had grabbed the gold from the Jamaican &apos;s grasp . 
she was so impressive in the semifinals . 
what happened was that Ottey visibly ran out of gas in the last few strides after leading for most of the race and faded to third behind Susanthika Jayasinghe who won Sri Lanka &apos;s first ever medal in a major athletics championship . 
Ottey , whose chance of success in the 100 went when she ran more than half the race at full speed after failing to hear a recall gun on a false start , said : &quot; I &apos;ve had many problems this year . 
I was sick for a long period so there was no way to prepare for the 200 and I just had nothing left over the last few strides . 
despite that Ottey won her 34th medal in a major championship and added to her own record of 13 world championships medals , She has won at least one medal at every world championships since they began in 1983 . 
Ottey has more athletics medals on her mantlepiece than Sri Lanka has in the entire country but they had something to celebrate as Jayasinghe came through to pip Ottey on the line for the silver . 
&quot; I knew she was going to get a medal from the first round , &quot; said Ottey . 
&quot; She ran very well and looked really impressive . 
Jayasinghe , who set three Asian records during the qualifing rounds , said : &quot; I didn &apos;t expect a medal , But I have prepared really hard for this and all the hard work has paid off . 
Ottey was first away and and led the race around the bend , but gradually began to tie up . 
Pintussevich caught her with 10 metres to run and Jayasinghe came through in the last few metres to steal second place . 
Pintussevich clocked 22.32 , Jayasinghe 22.39 and Ottey 22.40 .
