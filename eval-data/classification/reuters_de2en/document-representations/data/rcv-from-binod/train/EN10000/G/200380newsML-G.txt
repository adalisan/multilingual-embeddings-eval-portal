the devotees streamed in from the thickly wooded hills surrounding this remote town , most of them walking barefoot , to worship together . 
inside the Raj Bana Bihar , Rangamati &apos;s oldest and largest Buddhist temple , they lit candles and contributed their own bank notes to a growing &quot; money tree &quot; . 
sharing food as well as a song and a dance , the faithful , clad in the vibrant colours of this hilly region , later stood side-by-side as they prayed . 
but although the Kathin Chibor Dan festival is strictly Buddhist , it &apos;s participants are not . 
worshipping alongside 150,000 Buddhists were about 50,000 Moslems and Hindus . 
the scene last month is a familiar one in Rangamati , one of three districts in Bangladesh &apos;s rugged Hill Tracts region and an island of religious harmony in a surrounding sea of ethnic and religious troubles . 
elsewhere in the Hill Tracts , a protracted ethnic insurgency seethes . 
rebels of the Shanti Bahini ( peace force ) , made up mostly of Chakma tribesmen , demand autonomy in a savage revolt that has claimed an estimated 8,500 lives since 1973 . 
some 30,000 Bangladeshi troops are deployed to combat nearly 3,000 Shanti Bahini guerrillas . 
but in Rangamati , peace and piety prevail . 
at the centre of last month &apos;s Kathin Chibor Dan festivities were the temple &apos;s Vante ( head priest ) Shadhanananda Mahasthabir , and his guest of honour , Moulana Mohammad Nurul Islam , State Minister for Religious Affairs . 
Islam said he came to represent Bangladesh &apos;s Moslem community and offer its deepest love and respect for Buddha . 
he said both Buddha and Islam &apos;s prophet Mohammad preached peace and equality among all people . 
&quot; The jewels of the majestic Hill Tracts are its very beautiful , Mongoloid-featured tribespeople , mostly Buddhists , &quot; said Rabindra Lal Chakma , Chairman of the Rangamati Local Government Council . 
but , he adds , the 5,500 sq-mile ( 14,200 sq-km ) region &apos;s other great beauty was the peaceful co-existence of Buddhism and other religions . 
&quot; People from all religions come here to learn about Buddha &apos;s teachings and search for peace , &quot; temple official Benod Buhari Chakma told Reuters at the Raj Bana Bihar temple . 
bordering on both India and Burma , the Hill Tracts region has a population of nearly one million , more than half of them Buddhists , followed closely by Moslems , then a small percentage of Hindus and hill tribes . 
the area is also home to 13 tribes , the Chakmas being the largest . 
besides autonomy , the Chakma-led Shanti Bahini has demanded the expulsion of an estimated 300,000 Bengali-speaking settlers , mostly Moslems , who moved to the Hill Tracts in the early 1980s under a government plan to ease overcrowding elsewhere in the country . 
in September , the group abducted 35 of the settlers , shooting or stabbing to death 28 of them . 
most were also beheaded , military sources said . 
the sources in the Hill Tracts say the Shantis regularly collect &quot; donations &quot; -- often by force -- from tribespeople and use the funds to buy arms . 
they also collect &quot; tolls &quot; from Moslems at gunpoint . 
but the rebels never disrespect the religions of any of the Hill Tracts &apos; inhabitants , one military officer said . 
&quot; The Bengalis or Moslems are always within the range of rebel guns and often get killed . 
but religion is one thing not obstructed or flouted here , &quot; official Nazrul Islam said .
