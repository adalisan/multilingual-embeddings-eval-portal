a Shanghai firm has bought a bankrupt state distillery in the city through public tender , the first time such a takeover method has been used in China , the Liberation Daily said on Wednesday . 
analysts described the sale as an important step towards speeding up the disposal of bankrupt state firms , saying dozens more could be sold in this way . 
Guanshengyuan Co Ltd , a Shanghai food firm , paid 75 million yuan ( $ 9 million ) to take over the Shanghai Alcohol Factory , which was declared bankrupt in July with 680 workers , assets of 83.16 million yuan and debts of 350 million yuan , a Guanshengyuan official said . 
he said the company would not be responsible for the distillery &apos;s debts , but did not say how the debts would be handled . 
it is expected they will be absorbed by state banks and the state group to whom the factory originally belonged . 
the Liberation Daily said it was the first time a bankrupt state firm had been disposed of through a public tender , which was conducted through the Shanghai Property Assets Trading Centre . 
nine companies bid for the factory and the centre chose two for the final tender , Guanshengyuan and Shenzhen Laode New Power Investment Co Ltd . 
a panel of experts chose the Shanghai firm over the Shenzhen one , considering both the prices they were offering and other conditions of their bids , it said . 
the Property Assets Trading Centre has 28 of Shanghai &apos;s 48 bankrupt firms registered with it , waiting for buyers , and will dispose of them in a similar way , inviting bids from companies nationwide and from overseas , the newspaper said . 
&quot; This was a first because it was a public tender , &quot; said a Chinese bankruptcy consultant . 
&quot; previously , takeovers were negotiated bilaterally , between the buyer and seller . 
this process makes it more market-driven and more standardised . 
&quot; More bankrupt firms could be sold in this way , &quot; he said . 
workers of bankrupt firms get first call on money paid to buy them , followed by taxes owed to the state and then payments to other creditors , the People &apos;s Daily said on Tuesday . 
Shanghai , the country &apos;s biggest industrial city with thousands of state firms , is on the front line of China &apos;s battle against bankruptcy . 
official estimates say that 519,000 workers will lose their jobs in Shanghai &apos;s state and collective firms in 1996 and 1997 . 
as of the end of 1996 , the number of unemployed workers in Shanghai will be 250,000 , up from 200,000 a year earlier , they say . 
last month , in the first auction of its kind in China , Shanghai put up for auction prime land owned by a bankrupt state plastics factory at 2,600 yuan a square metre , but none of the four bidders was prepared to pay the price , the People &apos;s Daily said . 
the city plans to conduct a similar such auction later this month , it said .
