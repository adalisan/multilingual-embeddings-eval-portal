Slovenian shares ended virtually flat on Monday on low volume and traders attributed the muted activity to the absence of most participants due to an annual bourse seminar and the onset of summer . 
&quot; I expect shares to slide over the week on low volumes and I cannot forecast any improvement over the summer unless foreigners resume buying , &quot; said Dejan Bjelobaba , a trader of brokerage Fiba . 
in February the central bank put a damper on foreign buying , demanding international portfolio investors open share trading custody accounts at one of 14 Slovenian banks . 
in addition , traders cited generally sluggish trade in the summer months as a reason for their bearish forecasts . 
in three consecutive declines the blue-chip index shed 1.64 percent . 
overall six shares fell , six rose and one was flat , while 15 were untraded . 
turnover fell to 27.1 million tolars from 69.7 million . 
one trader said renewed foreign buying could boost prices by about 30 percent in the next few months , but feared that parliament &apos;s failure to ratify the EU association accord last week could keep foreign investors at bay over the summer . 
Slovenia &apos;s parliament last week postponed a vote on the ratification of an EU association accord , which was signed in June 1996 , in order to give parties more time to reach an agreement on the issue . 
the new date of the vote has not yet been set . 
traders estimated the index could fall by a further 15 percent if the parliament fails to ratify the agreement . 
Slovenia &apos;s only port Luka Koper was the most actively traded share and the leading decliner , falling 2.12 percent to 1,752 tolars on volume of 3,084 shares for total turnover of 5.4 million tolars . 
traders attributed the fall to Luka &apos;s poor liquidity . 
mineral water producer and health resort operator Radenska was the top gainer , firming 2.44 percent to 1,720 tolars on volume of 1,041 tolars . 
&quot; Based on its business results , which could be better , Radenska &apos;s price is most likely to stay around 1,700 tolars . 
today &apos;s rise could be part of Friday &apos;s technical correction of 4.87 percent , &quot; one broker said .
