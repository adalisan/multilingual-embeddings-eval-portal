Bahrain has sharply raised municipality taxes on industrial and commercial firms and hotels , the English-language Gulf Daily News newspaper reported on Monday . 
it said under the new tax structure for hotels , the monthly municipality tax for five-star outlets doubled to 2,000 dinars ( $ 5,305 ) a month . 
taxes for four-star hotels increased by 357 percent to 1,600 dinars and the tax on three- and two-star outlets rose 243 and 433 percent , respectively , to 1,200 dinars and 800 dinars . 
One-star hotel taxes doubled to 400 dinars , the paper said . 
the new rates came into effect in January . 
&quot; The government is revising a lot of charges for its services , &quot; the newspaper quoted a source at the Central Municipal Council ( CMC ) as saying . 
&quot; A lot of businesses have not been paying appropriate rates as these had been subsidised for a long time , and they were being given preferential prices for government services , &quot; it added . 
the daily said some businesses that had been paying 7.500 dinars a month were now being asked to pay 300 , an increase of 3,900 percent . 
businesses currently being targeted were those located in clearly industrial or commercial areas . 
but the new rates would apply to all industries , workshops and commercial establishments , including businesses carried out from private homes , it said . 
officials were not immediately available for comment . 
&quot; The increase is ridiculous , especially since the CMC offers very little service in industrial areas , &quot; the newspaper quoted an unnamed industrialist as saying . 
Bahrain has become a regional tourism centre , mainly for Gulf nationals taking advantage of its relaxed social environment , since the Bahraini-Saudi causeway was built in 1986 . 
the island , the least wealthy oil-producing Gulf Arab state , plans to spend around 900 million dinars in the next five years on development projects including a new power and water plant , a port and a bridge .
