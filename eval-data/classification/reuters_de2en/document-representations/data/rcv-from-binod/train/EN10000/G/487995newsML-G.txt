long before the morning sun clears the distant hills , drum beats that sound like a cannonade break the silence of this sleepy Sri Lankan village . 
the drum beats emanate from 70-year-old Kuragala Pinsara &apos;s workshop in Weligalle village in the central hill district of Kandy . 
every morning , Pinsara stretches cowhide over hollowed coconut bark , tightens it with a strip of goatskin and slaps the skin with both hands , creating a thunderous rhythm that reverberates down the hillside . 
&quot; Aha , now that is the rhythm I was searching for , &quot; he beams . 
&quot; Besides , it will wake up the others . 
Pinsara is correct . 
for soon most of the 300 inhabitants of the village are up too , beating drums that they make to keep alive an ancient tradition on this Indian Ocean island . 
drums have long played an important role in the life of the people of Sri Lanka , their hypnotic rhythms resonating at weddings , funerals and other ceremonial events . 
Pinsara , affectionately referred to as &quot; gurunnanse &quot; , or guru , is the patriarch of a clan of drum-makers living in Weligalle , about 130 km ( 80 miles ) east of the capital Colombo . 
today , the clan is reduced to about 70 families , but its members are among the few remaining traditional craftsmen of Sri Lanka who strive to make a living by practising the craft of their ancestors . 
&quot; They are not in it for the money , &quot; Pinsara said at his home-cum-workshop . 
&quot; You can &apos;t make much of a living these days by making and selling traditional drums . 
it is a desire to keep the traditions alive that keeps us in the business , &quot; he said . 
these days the ancient craft of drumming is a dying art as the cassette player replaces traditional rhythms at important events and as the younger generation migrates to cities in search of white-collar jobs . 
&quot; It is one of those tools of life that a majority of people have absolutely no need for . 
so our fight is uphill , to keep the art alive and the tradition from dying . 
how do they do it ? 
Pinsara and his clan manufacture traditional drums to order , producing a range of about seven drums that are still in demand . 
among them are the &quot; yak bera &quot; , or the devil drum , which is used for exorcisms . 
the oldest type of drum used in Sri Lanka is the &quot; daula &quot; , which is beaten only with specially crafted sticks . 
traditionally , the daula was used to announce the time . 
like many old drum-makers , Pinsara supports the idea that nature mysteriously gives drums their distinctive sound . 
&quot; In those days , trees found near gushing rivers and waterfalls were preferred for drum-making , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Such trees hear water flowing and absorb those natural sounds . 
when a tree is struck by lightning , the thunder enters the tree and improves the sound . 
but today , such considerations are a luxury and the drum maker has to make do with any trees that are available . 
these days , most Sri Lankan drums are made of jak , a yellowish hardwood in plentiful supply , and the bark of coconut , naturally rounded to resemble a drum . 
Cowhide or goatskin is used for the drum surfaces . 
monkey skin makes the best sound , but it is now prohibited to kill monkeys , Pinsara said . 
the guru &apos;s 38-year-old son , Kuragala Piyaratne , plans to follow in his father &apos;s footsteps and eventually lead the clan of drum-makers . 
&quot; People of my age don &apos;t do this for a living . 
but I have been around drums all my life and it will be good if I can spend the rest of my life around them too , &quot; he said .
