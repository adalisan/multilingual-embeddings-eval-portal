thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators marched through central Hong Kong in heavy rain on Tuesday , challenging the territory &apos;s new Chinese rulers to restore political reforms . 
&quot; We want democracy . 
we want it now , &quot; the boisterous group of several thousand people chanted . 
the march by the Alliance in Support of Democratic Patriotic Movements in China stretched for more than one km ( half mile ) through the central district of Hong Kong . 
onlookers enjoying the national holiday stopped to watch and people packed overhead foot bridges to get a better view . 
the protesters carried banners demanding the restoration of political reforms introduced in the twilight of British rule . 
Hong Kong &apos;s new leader , Tung Chee-hwa , has curbed the right to protest and foreign funding for political parties . 
one marcher , Anthea Ho , 27 , said she was in the protest because she feared democracy would die out in Hong Kong under Chinese rule . 
&quot; Hong Kong doesn &apos;t have enough democracy now , and if we go backwards , we &apos;ll have even less , &quot; Ho told Reuters . 
Cheung Chi-kwong , 50 , a factory-owner , said : &quot; Now many pro-democracy supporters are still being persecuted . 
why can this happen ? 
we must fight it now . 
a new 60-member legislature , anointed by Beijing , was sworn in on Tuesday , shortly after Britain gave up the fiercely capitalist colony of 6.4 million people to communist China . 
there was a large police presence but the march moved along in a peaceful and orderly fashion . 
the Alliance had notified the police that they intended to march and police said this was legal . 
the march was the first challenge to the new leadership which took over after midnight on Monday . 
in future , protesters will have to obtain permits from police before marching but for the first two days of Chinese rule they need only inform the police of their plans . 
earlier on Tuesday night , pro-democracy activists vowed to stage a campaign of protests and called on communist China to hold immediate legislative elections . 
&quot; In the eyes of the world , we call on the Chinese government to allow free , fair and democratic elections immediately , &quot; said pro-democracy leader Martin Lee . 
he was speaking to thousands of supporters at the building of the old elected legislature , dissolved by Beijing when Hong Kong was handed over by Britain . 
democracy activists poured into the streets during the handover ceremonies on Monday night , staging boisterous rallies and vowing to fight for civil liberties . 
&quot; The message is that we want democracy and we want it now , &quot; said leader Emily Lau at a rally in Statue Square . 
she led hundreds of people around the legislature , wrapping the building with a giant yellow ribbon . 
&quot; The yellow ribbon is our wish that democracy returns , &quot; said Lee Cheuk-yan , another prominent campaigner .
