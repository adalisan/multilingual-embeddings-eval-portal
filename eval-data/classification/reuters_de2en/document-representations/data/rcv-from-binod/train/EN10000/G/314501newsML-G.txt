South African Nobel peace laureate Desmond Tutu , renowned for his peaceful fight against apartheid , faced a new struggle on Friday after being diagnosed with cancer of the prostate . 
initial tests on the 65-year-old Tutu , who was admitted to hospital on Wednesday , had indicated no malignancy in the gland . 
&quot; ( But ) the archbishop &apos;s urologist proceeded with a full prostate operation and removed the bulk of the prostate . 
further tests were carried out on the removed tissues , &quot; his spokeswoman Christelle Terblanche said on Friday . 
&quot; The results of these tests have indicated a definite cancer of the prostate but further tests will be needed to determine the extent and its seriousness , &quot; she said . 
Tutu stepped down as Anglican archbishop of Southern Africa in June last year but still heads South Africa &apos;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission , a key body set up to probe the crimes of the apartheid era . 
an international figure praised for his opposition to the violence that apartheid engendered on both sides , he is widely regarded as the conscience of South Africa . 
critical of the excesses of President Nelson Mandela &apos;s African National Congress since its victory in all-race polls in 1994 , he has maintained the stature he earned as the thorn in the flesh of the country &apos;s former white rulers . 
although a long-time friend of Mandela &apos;s , he has slammed ANC parliamentarians for their eagerness to earn high wages and generous benefits , and once accused the government of stopping the &quot; gravy train &quot; only long enough to clamber on . 
Tutu was the first South African leader to moot the notion of reconciliation for a divided society -- nearly 20 years before it was reintroduced by Mandela . 
in a letter to then Prime Minister John Vorster in 1975 , Tutu wrote : &quot; I am deeply committed to real reconciliation with justice for all ... &quot; 
but he has fought back at attempts to limit the scope of his truth-seeking mission . 
I am annoyed and hurt for the many , many people that I know in this country who do want to tell their story , &quot; he said last April . 
a schoolteacher &apos;s son , Tutu was born in Klerksdorp , a small town west of the Johannesburg commercial capital , on October 7 , 1931 , and was ordained an Anglican priest in 1961 . 
Tutu married his wife Leah in 1955 and they have four grown children and five grandchildren . 
he swept into the limelight in 1978 when he was appointed as secretary-general of the South African Council of Churches and , in 1984 , he won the Nobel Peace Prize for his relentless but non-violent determination to win racial equality for his people . 
Tutu was enthroned as the first black archbishop of Cape Town in 1986 , becoming the head of the Anglican church , South Africa &apos;s fourth largest . 
Diminutive and grey-haired , he is jovial and sprinkles his speech with humour . 
he is dismissive of his stature and those who call him saint , joking : &quot; They are setting their standards too low .
