the number of hungry and homeless people in U.S. cities rose in 1996 and mayors warned Monday the situation could get worse in coming months as a landmark welfare law takes effect . 
the report by the U.S. Conference of Mayors marked the 12th year in a row that hunger and homelessness rose in the nation &apos;s cities . 
the findings were based on surveys in 29 urban areas . 
requests for emergency food aid rose by an average of 11 percent in 1996 , with 83 percent of the surveyed cities reporting an increase . 
requests for emergency shelter rose five percent , with 71 percent of cities showing growing need . 
mayors said there was some good news among the gloom . 
the overall increase in hunger was higher than last year , but some cities reported lower or level demand . 
further , the rise in homelessness was less than half the rate reported in the previous several years . 
the mayors warned that the welfare law could have a dramatic impact on U.S. cities . 
&quot; What we are reporting this year must be kept in perspective . 
while we see progress in some cities , overall demand for food and shelter continues to increase or it remains the same in most , &quot; said Mayor Cardell Cooper of East Orange , N.J. 
the welfare law ends a six-decade federal guarantee of aid to poor women and children , replacing it with a block grant that states can use to design their own welfare programmes . 
the law limits cash aid to five years and requires most recipients to work after two years . 
it reduces federal spending by about $ 55 billion over six years . 
&quot; Most officials fear that welfare reform and cuts in emergency aid will exacerbate their problems , forcing more people out of their homes , &quot; said Denver Mayor Wellington Webb .
