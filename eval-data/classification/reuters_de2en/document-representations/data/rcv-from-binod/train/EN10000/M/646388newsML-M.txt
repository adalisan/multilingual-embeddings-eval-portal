dated Brent &apos;s headlong slide entered its third week on Monday as bearish fundamentals forced the price of a wet cargo down by another 12 cents . 
a cargo loading June 17-19 traded at July Brent -62 cents , down from July -49 cents on Friday . 
&quot; There &apos;s just weren &apos;t any buyers around ... the offer had to come right down , &quot; said one trader . 
Brent &apos;s recent slump has helped lift refining margins for a complex plant in Rotterdam by 75 cents last week to average $ 2.42 a barrel , but buyers remain relaxed . 
&quot; The margins are a bit better , but refiners know there &apos;s plenty of supply around and they &apos;re not rushing back into the market , &quot; said one trader . 
two cargoes that were nominated from the paper chains on Monday were kept by a trading house ahead of the five o &apos;clock deadline . 
the cargoes are due to load in the June 24-26 window . 
other North Sea grades , particularly Oseberg and Statfjord are also well-supplied and recent trades have been done at much weaker differentials . 
a Statfjord was reported traded on Friday at dated Brent + 4 cents , more than 20 cents down on the last reported deal . 
because of the weaker differentials , sellers preferred to keep other trades on a private and confidential basis . 
traders expect that the North Sea July loading programmes , of which some are expected later this week , will show a rise in crude loadings as heavy June oilfield maintenance comes to an end . 
the Brent paper market was fairly inactive , with no intermonth spread trades reported in the afternoon , and values holding around -29 / -24 cents for July / August and -20 / -17 cents for August / September . 
CFDs for this week were valued at around July Brent -62 cents , while next week traded at August -65 cents . 
outright Brent levels were slightly weaker , with July Brent trading three cents down at $ 17.67 a barrel on the IPE screen at 1755 GMT . 
in the Mediterranean , a $ 1 improvement in refining margins last week was keeping the market fairly buoyant , at least in the short term . 
most large Urals cargoes for the first and second decade June were already sold , while a small cargo was heard traded on Friday at dated Brent - $ 1.25 a barrel . 
some lifters of rival Iraqi Kirkuk said they weren &apos;t expecting loadings to start until early July .
