the Budapest Stock Exchange closed higher in thin turnover on Monday bolstered by gains in some heavy-weight stocks but analysts believed the market was directionless . 
&quot; It &apos;s a very quiet market , there &apos;s not a lot of direction on the market and ... people are really adopting a sort of balanced position on the market at the moment , &quot; said Stephen O &apos;Sullivan , analyst at MC-BBL in London . 
&quot; Not a lot of new money coming in , not much redemptions . 
BUX futures closed higher for all maturities , rising by between 118.00 points and 237.50 points . 
spot share turnover totalled a meagre 1.39 billion forints . 
&quot; I guess one of the problems we see at the moment is typically the turnover on the markets , all are very low across the whole of eastern Europe and Russia , &quot; O &apos;Sullivan said . 
&quot; There is not a lot of buying interest , there is not a lot of selling interest either , particularly on the Russian market and that feeds through to eastern Europe as well . 
on Monday , the chemicals , OTP Bank and pharmaceuticals Richter were the main driving force behind the rise of the index . 
TVK gained 75 forints to end at 2,375 with some foreign buying , while Borsodchem gained 180 forints to end at 6,380 . 
OTP Bank rose 100 forints to finish at 3,990 , while Richter added 390 forints to 11,450 . 
traders and analysts were divided over the market &apos;s short-term outlook . 
&quot; It was not accidental that investors bought heavily in December and January , I expect this to continue sometime as the market has been standstill for quite a while , &quot; said Laszlo Baranyai of Gog Securities . 
&quot; In addition , the market might perhaps benefit from part of the capital which turns away from the Czech market , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I think people are now waiting perhaps to see changes in earnings growth and see whether it will stimulate new money .
