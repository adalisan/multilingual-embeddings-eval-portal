Toronto stocks finished weaker on Thursday , depressed by sagging bonds as nervous investors awaited Friday &apos;s Canadian and U.S. inflation data . 
declining stocks easily outpaced advances 531 to 347 with 281 issues ending flat . 
&quot; The market is very sensitive to economic data , particularly numbers that could affect interest rates , &quot; said IRA Katzin , an investment advisor with Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd . 
the U.S. non-farm payrolls report for August is considered a key measure of U.S. economic growth . 
Katzin said some investors were worried that a strong number could result in higher interest rates . 
Canada &apos;s August Labor force survey is also due on Friday . 
all but one of Toronto &apos;s 14 sub-groups ended the day on the weak side . 
gold , financial services , conglomerates and transportation posted the heaviest losses . 
the only bright spot was consumer products , which gained 44 points . 
* Seagram Co Ltd pushed the consumer product group higher , finishing up 0.80 at 46 . 
the entertaining and beverage giant reported improved second-quarter results earlier today . 
* Forestry products giant Domtar Inc topped active stocks , rising 0.10 to 11.30 on 4.3 million shares . 
traders said the heavy action was linked to the redemption of the company &apos;s convertible debentures , but takeover rumors were also swirling around the Quebec-based pulp and paper firm . 
* Among weak stocks , potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc lost 2.70 to 98.50 .
