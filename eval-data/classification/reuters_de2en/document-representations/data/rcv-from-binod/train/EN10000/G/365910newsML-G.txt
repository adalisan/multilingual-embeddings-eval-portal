the pro-Sikh Akali Dal party of former chief minister Prakash Singh Badal took a crucial early lead in key local polls in India &apos;s northern state of Punjab , officials said on Sunday . 
the state &apos;s chief electoral officer Brajendra Singh said a Hindu nationalist ally of the Dal won the first seat declared at 4.00 p.m ( 1030 GMT ) . 
trends from counting in 49 other constituencies of the 117-member assembly showed the Dal was leading in 34 , he added . 
Singh said the right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , which won a seat from the city of Jallandhar , was leading in six other constituencies while the ruling Congress party was ahead in three . 
election officials began counting votes at 8 a.m. ( 0230 GMT ) on Sunday , amid tight security across the state , and results were expected to be announced by late evening . 
more than 65 percent of Punjab &apos;s 15 million voters turned out on Friday in a remarkably peaceful election for the state assembly that is expected to thrust the Akali Dal party into power . 
the polls for the state assembly were the first in two decades not overshadowed by Sikh separatist violence . 
officials said there were too many divisions within the state &apos;s political groups to ensure badly-needed stability .
