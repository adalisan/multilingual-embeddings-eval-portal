one was Compaq Computer Corp. &apos; s strong earnings report on Thursday , which investors said was a good omen for the group . 
Compaq jumped 3-7 / 8 to 124 and Dell Computer surged 9-3 / 8 to 138 . 
&quot; People have had the jitters for second-quarter technology numbers and then Compaq comes in , &quot; said Daniel Kunstler at J.P. Morgan . 
&quot; What &apos;s going on is an interpretation that what &apos;s going on with Compaq has got to be good for Dell too . 
also , as tech stocks climbed again some investors began to show signs of pulling back from blue chips , producing a choppy market that saw the Dow fail in several attempts at the 8,000-point milestone . 
&quot; We keep flirting with the 8,000 level and we keep getting shot down , &quot; said Scott Bleier , chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd . &quot; This may mean the market will continue to face this kind of volatile consolidation just below 8,000 . 
but analysts said investors were still committed to pouring funds into U.S. financial assets . 
&quot; The Federal Reserve has managed to keep the economy on a slow , steady growth path with little or no inflation , &quot; said Charles White , managing director at Avatar Associates .
