Asian dollar deposit rates were quietly steady in lacklustre trade , dealers said on Tuesday . 
they said most traders were sidelined ahead of tonight &apos;s release of the U.S. first-quarter employment cost index , March durable goods orders and April consumer confidence index data . 
the employment cost index for the first quarter is forecast to show an increase of 0.9 percent compared with a 0.8 percent gain reported in the previous quarter . 
March durable goods orders are expected to be unchanged from February &apos;s 1.5 percent growth . 
the consumer confidence index for April is expected to ease to 118.4 percent against March &apos;s 118.5 percent . 
&quot; The market was quiet and featureless in the morning on some position adjustments . 
the market is now waiting for tonight &apos;s release of the first quarter employment cost index , durable goods figures and consumer confidence index , for fresh clues to market direction , &quot; a local dealer said . 
&quot; But unless the numbers are way off market expectations , I don &apos;t think there will be much impact as the numbers have built into the market and most people have already squared or are squaring their positions for the day , &quot; he said . 
in day-to-day rates , Tuesday / Wednesday was unchanged from Monday &apos;s 5-9 / 16 5-7 / 16 percent , Wednesday / Thursday rose 5 / 16 percentage point to 5-7 / 8 5-3 / 4 and week-fixed was unchanged at Monday &apos;s 5-5 / 8 5-1 / 2 percent . 
among longer dates , two-months was unchanged at 5-3 / 4 5-5 / 8 percent , four-months unchanged at 5-7 / 8 5-3 / 4 , six-months unchanged at 6-1 / 16 5-15 / 16 and twelve-months unchanged at 6-7 / 16 6-5 / 16 percent .
