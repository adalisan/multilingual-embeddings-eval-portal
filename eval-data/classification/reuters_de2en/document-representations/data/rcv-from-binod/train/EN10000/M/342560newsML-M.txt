the dollar surged to 122 yen in Tokyo trade on Wednesday , its highest level in almost four years , on growing conviction that the U.S. currency has further to climb and key nations will not block its ascent . 
on the stock market , the weaker yen set investors hunting for Japanese blue-chip exporters which would gain from the dollar &apos;s increased purchasing power , pushing up the key Nikkei average by a strong 1.5 percent . 
a dollar rally in U.S. trading on Tuesday picked up steam in Tokyo , with Bank-led buying pushing the greenback as high as 122.05 yen in morning trade , its highest point since February 1993 , dealers said . 
it later slipped back just below 122 yen , but was still up almost a yen over its late New York level . 
the dollar has been surging on the relative strength of the U.S. economy and signs that key nations are prepared to tolerate its advance . 
dealers said the dollar could scale fresh heights . 
&quot; There are no real barriers , &quot; one said . 
extra fuel was added to the rise in Tuesday overseas trade with the release of benign U.S. inflation data and fresh signals that the &quot; Group of Three &quot; nations -- the United States , Germany and Japan -- will not stand in its way . 
the dollar had finished at about 121 yen in U.S. trade on Tuesday after surging to a peak of 121.75 yen during the day . 
fears of dollar-selling intervention by the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) , which had been curbing the dollar , mostly faded after a Japanese finance official said on Tuesday that the yen &apos;s recent slide was not a cause for immediate concern . 
on Wednesday , a senior Japanese Finance Ministry official told Reuters Japan should keep close watch on currency moves because there were signs the trends could speed up . 
&quot; There are signs that recent currency movements may start accelerating , &quot; Kosuke Nakahira , a special adviser to the finance minister , said in an interview . 
he added that wild swings were not good for business as they could lead to a loss of confidence in a currency . 
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was quoted by Jiji news agency on Wednesday as saying he did not welcome rapid changes in foreign exchange levels , although he added that recent moves reflected the dollar &apos;s strength . 
neither of these comments stood in the dollar &apos;s way . 
a broad dollar buying spree joined by securities firms which had held back from buying previously , as well as trust banks and U.S. funds , pushed the greenback rapidly higher . 
on the stock market , a surge in interest in shares in export-oriented multinationals drove the 225-share Nikkei average higher . 
in mid-afternoon trade the Nikkei was moderately higher , up 267.32 points or 1.50 percent at 18,063.89 points . 
&quot; Depending on the mood of the market , currency fluctuations can be taken either as positive or negative , &quot; one broker said . 
although a weak yen can help exporters by making their products more competitive overseas , it can also encourage foreign investors to sell Japanese shares as their value in dollar terms ebbs away . 
the market , battered in recent sessions by worries over the economy and the health of the banking sector , chose to take the weaker yen as a plus for exporters , the broker said . 
currency dealers said the dollar &apos;s dip back below 122 yen was little more than a temporary setback . 
they noted that many exporters , who often sell the greenback at its highs , appear to have mostly completed selling dollars through forward contracts until the end of March and are in no hurry to move , meaning little stands in the way of a further advance . 
&quot; We will see still more highs , &quot; one dealer said .
