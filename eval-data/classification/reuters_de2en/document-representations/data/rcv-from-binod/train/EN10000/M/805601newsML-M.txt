following is the China Interbank offered Rate ( CHIBOR ) for Monday issued by the official Xinhua news agency on behalf of the People &apos;s Bank of China , the central bank . 
the figures represent weighted averages and not closing prices and are annual percentage rates . 
turnover fell to 828 million yuan from 1.05 billion yuan with the seven-day contract the most actively traded . 
trading was dull mainly because of little trading by the first-tier members -- state banks and short-term financial centres , money brokerages run by the central bank , traders said . 
an oversupply of funds was seen on the first tier of the interbank money market with many bankers now borrowing money on the interbank state debt market , where interest rates are lower , they said . 
both markets are based in Shanghai . 
but on the second tier of the money market where non-banking financial institutions trade through the short-term financial centres , securities houses were active traders , traders said . 
trading was likely to continue to be dull with the interbank rates moving in a narrow range in the short term with no fresh market-moving news around the corner , traders said .
