Egyptian human rights groups said on Thursday a group of Moslem clerics had given armed Islamists the green light to kill a prominent philosopher whose writings the clerics said insulted Islam . 
the groups were referring to a statement issued by al-Azhar Front for scholars ( AFS ) on Tuesday that said the work of Hassan Hanafi , a professor at Cairo University , &quot; insulted Moslem scholars &quot; and &quot; rejected the clear teachings of the Koran &quot; . 
the front is part of the eminent al-Azhar institution , one of the Sunni Moslem world &apos;s most respected seats of learning . 
&quot; We fear that extremist Islamic groups will use this statement as a legal cover to assassinate Hassan Hanafi as these groups believe it is their duty to carry out the punishment of death immediately on apostates , &quot; EOHR said in a statement . 
the Centre for Human Rights Legal Aid ( CHRLA ) , another independent rights group , urged the government to uphold international conventions on freedom of expression . 
&quot; The Centre expresses its condemnation of opinions such as that issued by al-Azhar Front for scholars , which can be considered the moral liquidation of Hanafi and might very well lead to his physical liquidation , &quot; CHRLA said . 
&quot; Intellectual disputes should not be solved through apostacy campaign , but rather through serious dialgoue in which all parties have equal opportunities to express their points of view , and where they can debate freely without fear , threat , or hindrance , &quot; it said in a statement . 
both groups said it was not the first time that condemnations by clerics had spurred attacks by Moslem militants on writers and intellectuals . 
militants trying to turn Egypt into their vision of a strict Islamic state tried to kill Nobel prize-winning author Naguib Mahfouz in 1995 for writing a novel they considered blasphemous . 
the AFS statement , which claimed Hanafi was behind &quot; a destructive project against which the whole nation must mobilise &quot; , looks set to ignite another national debate in Egypt on freedom of expression and opinion . 
an Egyptian court in August threw its weight behind Islamists by upholding a ruling that a happily married university professor must divorce his wife because he was found to have renounced Islam . 
the case of Nasr Abu Zeid and his wife Ibthihal Younis -- Cairo University academics who now teach in the Netherlands -- dismayed human rights groups and intellectuals in Egypt who feared it would curtail freedom .
