Bosnian Serbs are once again playing a familiar cat and mouse game with the international community and this time the issue is supervision of Bosnia &apos;s local polls next year , Western officials in Sarajevo said . 
&quot; First they sound a negative note publicly and then in subsequent contacts they say they are willing to cooperate , &quot; an OSCE official told Reuters on Thursday . 
&quot; We understand this to be a tactic on their behalf . 
U.S. envoy for Balkan affairs John Kornblum failed on Wednesday to win an agreement from Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic to agree to international supervision of municipal elections , now delayed until spring 1997 . 
the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) has been in charge of organising elections under the terms of the Dayton peace accord which ended the Bosnian war , but it has yet to secure an extension of mandate to conduct and supervise the local polls . 
the OSCE &apos;s head of mission , Robert Frowick , announced on Tuesday that the local polls had to be postponed because of continuing political problems , but conceded that the Serbs &apos; reluctance to go forward was decisive . 
Tuesday &apos;s decision was the second postponement of the troublesome municipal elections , originally delayed in the run up to general elections held on September 14 because of voter registration irregularities . 
Bosnia &apos;s Moslems and Croats have already signed the mandate extension but the Serbs are yet to be convinced , Frowick said . 
but another OSCE official said that , in contacts with Plavsic on Wednesday , he had the impression that she would come to terms . 
&quot; We do have a long way ahead ( with mandate extension ) but she has never closed the door to OSCE supervision , &quot; he said . 
the United States has accused Plavsic of blocking elections and said it will throw its diplomatic weight behind efforts to have internationally supervised polls next year . 
&quot; That will be the result here , and the Bosnian Serbs ought to understand that right now , &quot; U.S. State Departement spokesman Nicholas Burns said . 
the Serbs mastered the art of political brinksmanship over the 43 months of war , usually succumbing to international pressure after ardous negotiations and often after deadlines had expired . 
&quot; Now that hardline nationalists won the September elections and have to backpedal on their proclaimed separatist goals , they have to play a double game -- one statement for their public and a different one for us , &quot; a western diplomat said . 
the Serbs fear that Moslem refugees could vote them out of power in towns where they now have a majority following a campaign of ethnic cleansing of thousands of non-Serbs during the war . 
with no end to the standoff in sight , international negotiators will need to make intensive efforts in the coming weeks to work out clear strategy to win Serb agreement on mandate extension , the diplomat said . 
but critics say the international community lost some of its leverage over the Serbs when U.N.-imposed economic sanctions were lifted recently . 
it still has ther carrot of millions of dollars worth of reconstruction aid to bargain with . 
&quot; In the long run , the Bosnian Serbs will have to realise they will suffer if they do not accept the economic aid , &quot; an OSCE official said .
