Singapore will continue to grow in importance as a centre for foreign exchange trading despite the rising cost of doing business in the city-state , the head of Southeast Asia &apos;s fifth largest bank said on Friday . 
overseas Union Bank Ltd &apos;s president and chief executive officer , Peter Seah , said Singapore had all the essential ingredients for a successful foreign exchange market . 
&quot; If you remove the dollar-yen trading volume from the numbers , then Singapore is the third largest foreign exchange trading centre in the world . 
certainly it is a market with bigger depth and volume than Tokyo , &quot; Seah told Reuters in an interview . 
&quot; You are looking at a very vibrant foreign exchange market and I see that as a major growth area for Singapore , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s also an area which receives a lot of encouragement and support from the government . 
OUB is the fifth largest bank in ASEAN after the other three Singapore banks -- The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd , Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp and United Overseas Bank Ltd -- and Thailand &apos;s Bangkok Bank , Seah said . 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) groups Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam . 
the bank has a large treasury operation which accounts for about 10 percent of its income , which includes active dealings in foreign exchange and other currency-based derivatives . 
Seah said Singapore was a far more &quot; internationally orientated &quot; market than Tokyo . 
&quot; In terms of depth of services available and instruments that are traded here , we are already ahead . 
for the moment we see overselves as complementing Tokyo , &quot; he said . 
&quot; In the longer term we don &apos;t know . 
Tokyo will certainly always remain a major threat to Singapore in terms of its ability to service the region . 
Seah said the Singapore International Monetary Exchange ( SIMEX ) , which trades a range of currency-based derivatives , had recovered quickly from the &quot; little blip &quot; over the collapse of British merchant bank Barings . 
losses run up by Barings Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson in Nikkei futures traded on SIMEX broke Barings in 1995 . 
&quot; But the Barings case came and went very quickly and our markets here have gone from strength to strength , &quot; Seah said . 
&quot; We see that continuing and we see Singapore playing a major role also in the development of regional currency trading . 
Seah said he expected Singapore &apos;s foreign exchange market over the longer term to be the main market servicing Southeast Asia and the wider region to give corporations a place to trade and to hedge their foreign currency positions . 
&quot; Rising cost is an area of concern in Singapore but look at London , &quot; he said . 
&quot; London today continues to be the dominant financial centre despite the high cost of doing business . 
&quot; ( Cost ) is an important consideration , but what is more important is the faciliites that are available , the infrastructure , the ease of communications , the language capabilities , the people , the skills available , the critical mass of financial institutions that are available here , &quot; he said . 
&quot; All these add up , together with the very singular trust and support by the government , to ensure that financial institutions here receive the right perks , are supported by the right laws and guided by the right type of regulations to be able to operate effectively and efficiently . 
&quot; If you put all that together and look at the level of productivity that you can get out of operating in Singapore , the cost of doing business here becomes secondary for the financial institution that wants to locate in Singapore , &quot; he said .
