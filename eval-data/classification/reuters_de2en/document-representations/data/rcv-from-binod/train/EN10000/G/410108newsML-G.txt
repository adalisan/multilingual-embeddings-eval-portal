eighty years ago on Sunday , Nicholas II , Tsar of All the Russias , signed away the crown of his Romanov ancestors in a vain bid to avert civil war . 
his lonely abdication in a railway carriage at Pskov on March 2 , 1917 is little remembered . 
what some saw as a new beginning for Russia after centuries of tyranny turned out to be a false start . 
within six months the moderate reformers who ousted the tsar fell victim themselves to Lenin &apos;s Bolsheviks who , in July 1918 , butchered Nicholas and his entire family in Yekaterinburg as Russia lurched into a civil war from which the repressive Russian Communist party emerged as victor . 
now free of communism but stuck in economic crisis after the break up of the Soviet Union , many Russians wonder what might have been had the events of 1917 been different . 
&quot; eighty years ago Russia tried to pull herself out of a situation which by its dramatic nature strikingly recalls the present day -- those same false hopes and unfulfilled promises of a better life . 
&quot; Vek newspaper said this week . 
&quot; It &apos;s as if we face those same problems which the country failed to correct at the beginning of the century . 
&quot; One can only lament that all this happened back then because Russia was beginning to develop , and but for the abdication , I think Russia already long ago would have been the richest country in the world , &quot; Eduard Rossel , governor of the Sverdlovsk region around Yekaterinburg said on Friday . 
Rossel &apos;s predecessor in Soviet times was Boris Yeltsin , the local Communist party boss of the Urals city in the early 1980s when he ordered the demolition of the house where Nicholas , the Empress Alexandra and their children were put to death . 
when Slava Platusov was a boy , he secretly hoped to uncover some of the mysteries of the last tsar by sneaking into the basement of that house . 
now he is free to make unflattering comparisons between Yeltsin &apos;s Russia and that of Nicholas II . 
&quot; You can &apos;t even compare these years with 1914 , when Russia held the second place among all nations , when it was so fully supplied that it sold bread abroad , &quot; Platusov said on Friday , close to the site , now marked by a tiny new church . 
the Russian Orthodox Church , which once attributed divine authority to the tsars , is discussing making Nicholas II a saint . 
but despite a longing for better times -- many overlook the sorry lot of ordinary folk under the tsars -- few Russians see any chance of a return to monarchy . 
&quot; Russia today is not ready for monarchy , &quot; said Alexander Avdonin , the man who discovered the Nicholas and Alexandra &apos;s remains near Yekaterinburg . 
&quot; You must believe in the tsar , in god and in the country , and this is all missing today . 
Yeltsin has , according to some reports , flirted with the idea of giving at least one claimant to the throne a special status to allow him to return to Russia . 
but the Kremlin denies any suggestion that the 15-year-old Prince Georgy , brought up in Madrid , might one day wear the tsar &apos;s crown . 
Sergei Kolotvinov , Yekaterinburg head of the monarchist nobility Assembly , said Georgy should return and that , in seven to 10 years time , a referendum should decide whether to restore the monarchy . 
but most Russians believe talk of a new tsar is as wistful as the secret tunnels Paltusov searched for as a boy . 
&quot; Today there &apos;s just no way to return to the monarchy , the people have changed completely , &quot; he said . 
&quot; For us , after 70 years of communism , nothing is sacred anymore .
