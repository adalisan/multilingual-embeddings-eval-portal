traders are planning to offer Oman crude into the Thai Bangchak November tender priced against Dubai crude to avoid being exposed to any change in the official Oman contract price , industry sources said on Wednesday . 
Oman &apos;s Ministry of Petroleum and Minerals ( MPM ) is expected to release its retroactive September price , which acts as the benchmark for forward trading , as soon as late Wednesday , traders said . 
that makes it difficult for traders to assess where they should pitch their offers for the Bangchak tender , which closes at 1800 hours Bangkok time on Wednesday and is valid for 24 hours . 
&quot; It &apos;s unfortunate that the bids are due today with the Oman number coming out , &quot; one trader said . 
the 120,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) Bangchak refinery has tendered to buy 500,000 barrels of Middle East crude and 600,000 barrels of Far East grades . 
Traditonally , the refinery has had a big appetite for Oman crude . 
the so-called MPM price was set in August at $ 19.60 and at a 96-cent premium to the assessment of Gulf benchmark Dubai prices , which traders say has priced Oman too high . 
three or four cargoes of October Oman are still overhanging the market and November trade has been slow , trading in a range of Dubai plus 82 to 85 cents , traders said . 
Oman normally trades at a differential to MPM , but spot market trading has switched to Dubai-related quotes to try to avoid exposure to the MPM base price . 
term lifters , who are paying at MPM or a premium to MPM , have to trade at a loss if they resell their term barrels . 
an industry source said some traders were considering pitching their tender offers at November Dubai quotes plus 85 cents , but the refinery was likely to look more favourably on Dubai quotes plus 70 to 80 cents . 
&quot; Dubai plus 70 to 80 cents could be quite attractive , &quot; one source said . 
&quot; sellers who are not sure what will happen will have to offer at a deep discount ( to the MPM ) . 
Bangchak will then have a double benefit if the MPM is cut by Oman , &quot; he said . 
Oman is not due to release its November MPM price until the first week of December , but traders said they expect the premium over Dubai assessments to be narrowed in coming months . 
so for the time being they do not favour trading at a discount to MPM which could leave them with a loss-making position .
