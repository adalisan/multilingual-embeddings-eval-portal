Danish international Brian Laudrup said on Wednesday he would complete his existing contract with Scottish champions Glasgow Rangers , quashing talk that he was moving to English title holders Manchester United . 
Laudrup , who had also been linked to Ajax Amsterdam , met Rangers chairman David Murray on Tuesday . 
&quot; After positive talks I have decided to complete my existing contract with Rangers , &quot; he said . 
Laudrup has agreed to stay in Scotland until the end of next season , although he said during negotiations with Ajax earlier this month he would leave when his contract expires in a year &apos;s time . 
the twice-crowned Scottish player of the year left Denmark in 1987 and played for Bayern Munich , fiorentina and AC Milan before joining Rangers where he enjoyed three successful seasons , winning the championship every year . 
but Laudrup appeared eager for a move and seemed likely to join fellow Dane Morten Olsen , who becomes Ajax &apos;s coach next month . 
&quot; The only thing I &apos;m missing is international success at club level , &quot; Laudrup said . 
&quot; It &apos;s not about money , it &apos;s about ambition . 
but chairman Murray persuaded Laudrup to stay and did not rule out extending his contract at a later date . 
&quot; I am delighted for everyone connected with the club that Brian has agreed to remain at Ibrox . 
we sat down and had a lengthy discussion in what direction Rangers is moving and genuinely believe we are in a position to meet his personal ambitions , &quot; Murray said . 
&quot; Hopefully in the future we would be able to extend his existing contract when it expires , &quot; he added . 
Laudrup said : &quot; The next season is a very important one for the club and hopefully I can do well once the new team is assembled and settled in . 
this is the second rebuff in as many days for Manchester United . 
on Tuesday the club failed to tempt Bayern Munich defender Markus Babbel . 
Laudrup had been seen as a potential replacement for Eric Cantona .
