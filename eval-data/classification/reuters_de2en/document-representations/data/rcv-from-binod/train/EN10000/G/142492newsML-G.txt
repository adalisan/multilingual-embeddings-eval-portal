Indonesian cocoa growers have joined hands with state bodies and American researchers to stamp out the pod borer pest which is spreading in the key producing region of Sulawesi , an industry official said on Thursday . 
Halim Abdul Razak , vice-chairman of the Indonesia Cocoa Association ( Askindo ) , said the group had signed an agreement with the American Cocoa Research Institute ( ACRI ) to help farmers bring the pest under control . 
&quot; Government agencies will also be involved in the project , which is the first concerted move in Indonesia to bring the pod borer infestation under control , &quot; he told Reuters by phone from Ujung Pandang , capital of South Sulawesi . 
Halim , who heads the project , said the pest could reduce output by up to 60 percent and posed a serious hurdle to Indonesia &apos;s aim to move up from its current spot as the world &apos;s third-largest cocoa producer . 
British commodity house E.D. &amp; F.Man said in May Indonesia &apos;s cocoa production was expected to reach 290,000 tonnes in the 1995 / 96 ( October / September ) crop year , making it the world &apos;s third-largest producer after the Ivory Coast and Ghana . 
cocoa beans are damaged when larvae of the moth-like pod borer penetrate the pod to feed on the kernel , making the beans hard and unsuitable for consumption . 
&quot; The infestation has spread to growing areas in Mamuju and Luwu to the north of Ujung Pandang , &quot; he said . 
&quot; About 50 hectares ( 120 acres ) in Mamuju and 500 hectares ( 1,200 acres ) in Luwu have been affected . 
&quot; The pod borer has begun spreading to strategic growing areas , and if not checked can have serious repercussions on our cocoa production , &quot; he said . 
Indonesia &apos;s cocoa exports to the key U.S. market slumped to 46,663 tonnes in 1995 from 79,434 tonnes the previous year due to stringent quality checks . 
Askindo figures show the pod borer affected 4,568 hectares ( 11,290 acres ) in Central Sulawesi , 300 hectares ( 740 acres ) in South Sulawesi and 283 hectares ( 700 acres ) and 65 hectares ( 160 acres ) in North and Southeast Sulawesi . 
industry sources said some 40,000 hectares ( 99,000 acres ) had been infected nationwide . 
Dutch agri-bank Rabobank said in a report released last Monday that pod borer infestation was one of the main problems faced by the Indonesian cocoa sector . 
Askindo &apos;s Halim said that under the project to contain the pod borer , farmers would be taught how to fight the pest using low-residue pesticides . 
he said that pesticides which left a high-content of residue could result in the cocoa facing difficulties in entering health-conscious export markets . 
Halim said that previous attempts to contain the pest by destroying affected trees or parts of them had been unsuccessful because of losses encountered by farmers . 
&quot; Cocoa is the very life source for most of the smallholders whose plots cover only one to two hectares , &quot; he said . 
he said the pod borer was relatively new to areas like Mamuju and Luwu , where farmers were just learning how to handle the infestation . 
&quot; It &apos;s going to be along process . 
&quot; In places where the pest has been prevalent for three to four years and pest management has been good , the drop in production has been limited to 10-15 percent , &quot; he said .
