manager Bobby Gould said on Saturday Welsh soccer had hit rock bottom but insisted he would not resign despite a 7-1 thrashing by the Netherlands -- the worst World Cup defeat ever suffered by Wales . 
asked if he was thinking of stepping down , he snapped back a defiant &quot; no &quot; . 
Gould said there had been harsh words for the players inside the dressing room after the game but refused to publicly condemn them . 
&quot; We &apos;re all in this together , &quot; said Gould . 
&quot; We &apos;ve hit rock bottom . 
the players have all said they are at the lowest ebb of their careers and so am I. 
&quot; We saw a great team give a wonderful performance tonight . 
they were better than us in every position -- except perhaps the goalkeeper . 
&quot; said Gould , acknowledging a debt to Neville Southall , without whose heroics the score could have been in double figures ,
