although Burma &apos;s ruling generals say their economy is booming , macroeconomic problems and political uncertainty paint a much less rosy picture for the economy , diplomats and economists said . 
rising prices , growing international complaints about the military regime and the threat of looming sanctions by the United States have hindered economic progress , they said . 
government officials say Burma &apos;s economy is growing and on the road to recovery after more than 25 years of declines under an isolationist socialist policy . 
they say liberalisation efforts made since the State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) seized power in 1988 have been beneficial as the economy opens up to foreign investment . 
total approved foreign investment from 1988 to January this year totalled about $ 5.36 billion from 237 projects . 
but economists estimate only about half of that has actually been invested since SLORC opened up the economy . 
some of the companies are awaiting more political stability before beginning operations . 
the SLORC also continues to come under international pressure for human rights abuses and for failing to recognise a democratically elected government . 
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi &apos;s National League for Democracy won elections in 1990 but the SLORC never recognised the result . 
others are waiting to see if the economy is on track , and many economists say it is not . 
the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) said in a report to be presented to Burma &apos;s rulers on Wednesday that the economy was still suffering serious macroeconomic problems and the SLORC needed to adopt sweeping reform programmes to set it straight . 
&quot; The macroeconomic situation has taken a marked turn for the worse since April 1996 , &quot; said the IMF report , a copy of which was obtained by Reuters . 
&quot; Foreign exchange reserves have fallen sharply , the exchange rate in the parallel market depreciated by 40 percent in six months and inflation has accelerated . 
economic problems could spark political instability if left unchecked , diplomats said . 
&quot; The biggest problem is inflation , especially in the city , &quot; one Asian diplomat said , noting inflation is around 30-40 percent a year . 
&quot; Incomes of people are still low and the lives of ordinary people are still very hard . 
he said the SLORC could face political as well as economic problems if prices continued to rise and the Burmese people were unable to buy even staple goods . 
&quot; As long as Myanmar ( Burma ) can produce enough rice there will be no uprising . 
but if a problem occurs with rice maybe people will turn to the streets , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The government knows the potential problems , that is why it is always trying to keep stocks of rice and stay in control . 
it does not want unrest , especially now , &quot; the Asian diplomat said noting that Burma was awaiting approval to become a full member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations . 
and the nagging fear adding to all the other problems is the threat of possible economic sanctions by the United States . 
Washington has approved a bill for sanctions if the political situation in Burma worsens , and some diplomats say recent repression of the democracy movement led by Nobel Peace laureate Suu Kyi is enough to trigger the law . 
Suu Kyi &apos;s movements have been severely restricted since student unrest in December . 
&quot; The main concern for companies ... is economic sanctions , &quot; one diplomat said . 
&quot; If the U.S. imposes economic sanctions it will have a big impact on all companies -- not just Americans . 
he said even Asian companies , which have been showing the most interest in Burma over the past few years , could be convinced to pull out or not to invest in Burma if the U.S. sanctions are imposed . 
Suu Kyi , who was released from six years of house arrest in July 1995 , favours sanctions and has urged foreigners not to invest in Burma until the situation improves .
