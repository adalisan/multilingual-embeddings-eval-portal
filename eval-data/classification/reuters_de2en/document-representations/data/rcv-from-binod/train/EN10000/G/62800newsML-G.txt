defence Minister Chiang Ching-ling on Wednesday denied a newspaper report that Taiwan and the United States were evaluating possible deployment of a joint anti-missile system on the island . 
&quot; What the newspaper said is not correct , &quot; Chiang said on state-funded television . 
&quot; There is no such thing . 
it &apos;s just a newspaper report , &quot; Chiang told reporters when asked about the report . 
the United Daily News , quoting unnamed generals , said the system , which also would protect Japan and South Korea , was discussed at a secret meeting in early September . 
officials routinely deny reports about Taiwan weapons development and military contacts with foreign countries . 
the latest report could not be confirmed independently and it was not known if it was related to Taiwan &apos;s planned purchase of U.S.-made anti-missile missiles . 
the mass-circulation United Daily News said planning for the missile defence system was sparked by a series of intimidating military manoeuvres mounted by arch-rival China since mid-1995 . 
&quot; Both the U.S. side and we feel the emergent need to establish an anti-missile system after communist China &apos;s two rounds of missile tests targeting Taiwan last year and this year , &quot; the newspaper quoted the generals as saying . 
the report did not say where the meeting was held or whether concrete conclusions were reached . 
China launched a nine-month series of war games and missile tests off Taiwan after President Lee Teng-hui &apos;s private but high-profile visit to the United States in June 1995 . 
Beijing has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province not entitled to foreign ties since a civil war split them in 1949 . 
China &apos;s missile tests prompted Washington to send two aircraft carriers near the Taiwan strait to monitor the crisis during Taiwan &apos;s March presidential election . 
Beijing maintains a standing threat to recover the island by force if it opts for independence . 
both governments say they want reunification , but under very different terms . 
under pressure from China , Taiwan has faced difficulties in purchasing advanced weapons from the West but the United States , which switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taipei in 1979 , asserts a right to provide the island defensive weapons . 
in 1993 Washington said Taiwan planned a private purchase from U.S. defence giant Raytheon Co. of a &quot; modified air defence system &quot; based on the Gulf War-tested Patriot anti-missile missile in a deal estimated at $ 175 million .
