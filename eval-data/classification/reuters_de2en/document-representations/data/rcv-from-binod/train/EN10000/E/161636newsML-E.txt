odds on a cut in Australian interest rates shortened further on Friday when retail sales data showed shoppers shunned the malls in September . 
retail turnover plunged 3.7 percent to A $ 10.05 billion when the market had been betting on a modest 0.5-percent dip . 
it was the biggest monthly drop since April 1994 and promised to sharply reduce the contribution sales make to economic growth in the September quarter . 
&quot; I think a rate cut next week looks highly probable , &quot; said Stephen Koukoulas , senior economist at Citibank Australia . 
the Reserve Bank of Australia holds its monthly board meeting on Tuesday , when Australian markets will be in holiday mood for the running of the Melbourne Cup horse racing classic . 
speculation has been rampant for weeks that it will sanction a 0.5-point cut in official cash rates to 6.5 percent . 
any cut decided on Tuesday would probably be announced on Wednesday . 
the sales figures were only the latest in a run of weak data which have caused analysts to seriously review their assumptions about the health of the Australian economy . 
&quot; When you combine this with the skilled vacancy survey , poor exports in the balance of payments data , the building approvals numbers , and the CPI ( inflation ) numbers it is all pointing now to a very weak economy , &quot; said Dresdner chief economist Rob Henderson . 
&quot; I think the chance of a rate cut next week is now better than a 50-50 chance , &quot; said Henderson . 
&quot; I can &apos;t see a lot can be gained now by holding off for another month . 
some even thought the omens were gloomy enough to suggest an easing of more than 0.5 point was needed , perhaps in one go or more likely in two stages of half point . 
&quot; Combined with low inflation and signs that wages growth is slowing , this definitely points to the Reserve Bank easing , &quot; said Shane Oliver , chief economist at amp Investments . 
&quot; I think there &apos;ll now be a bit more debate about the magnitude of that easing , &quot; he added . 
the money market was already contemplating such a scenario and pushed the March 90-day bank bill future contract to 93.70 , implying they saw scope for rates to hit 6.30 percent or lower . 
the only caveat analysts offered was the RBA &apos;s concern over the high level of some enterprise wage agreements , a worry the bank explicitly highlighted in its September quarter economic bulletin just a fortnight ago .
