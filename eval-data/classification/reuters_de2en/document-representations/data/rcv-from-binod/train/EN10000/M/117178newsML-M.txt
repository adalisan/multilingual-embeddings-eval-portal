U.S. crude differentials eased late Tuesday on softer refinery runs while outright prices were only modestly lower tracking crude futures . 
in addition to a weekend fire at BP &apos;s Toledo , Ohio , refinery , which left more crude supplies for Midwest markets , the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) report showed a drop in crude runs to 92.7 percent , down 2.2 percent . 
November West Texas Intermediate / Cushing was at $ 25.40-50 a barrel , down five cents from Monday &apos;s cash market . 
domestic crude prices held to a steady erosion over the day led lower by the stumble in Light Louisiana sweet . 
&quot; The ramifications of BP &apos;s problems took the grades lower , &quot; an oil broker said . 
BP said Tuesday there were no changes in the status of the 155,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) Toledo facility , where crude runs were curtailed by a fire on Saturday . 
light Louisiana sweet / St. 
James eased from the morning &apos;s 54-cents premium level against WTI , to 52 cents later , down from highs on Monday at 65 cents . 
heavy Louisiana sweet / Empire traded at 40 cents , down nine cents from previous trade . 
heavier grades like West Texas sour / Midland declined to minus $ 1.38 , off six cents from earlier morning levels . 
the API report for crude was neutral with slight draws in most regions and a total draw of 417,000 barrels nationwide . 
but the market &apos;s obsession with shortages of heating oil , coupled with a fall in crude runs , were viewed likely to keep the crude and products uptrend broadly intact .
