the Bosnian Serb constitutional court on Thursday suspended embattled President Biljana Plavsic &apos;s attempt to dissolve parliament and call elections to prevent the parliament removing her from power . 
it said the suspension would remain in force until it took a final decision on a challenge to Plavsic &apos;s move by her government opponents , who claim it was illegal . 
government hardliners loyal to indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic have help from Serbia in their struggle to topple Plavsic . 
Momcilo Krajisnik , the Serb member of Bosnia &apos;s collective presidency , travelled to Belgrade on Wednesday to consult with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and the two men called for &quot; unity &quot; among Bosnian Serb leaders . 
Plavsic rejected Milosevic &apos;s invitation to mediate in the conflict and instead held a rally attended by thousands of supporters in the eastern town of Bijeljina . 
Plavsic , who fears she may have been compromised in Serb eyes by Western support for her battle with Karadzic and his hardliners , condemned the Thursday killing by NATO peacekeeping troops of a Bosnian Serb police chief wanted on war crimes charges . 
she demanded the release of another Bosnian Serb captured in the raid and told peacekeeping commander General William Crouch in a letter : &quot; I fear the reaction of the people will be terrible and I cannot bear any responsibility for this . 
the Bosnian Serb leader is waging a battle with former associates grouped around ex-president Karadzic , accusing them of large-scale corruption . 
by meeting Milosevic , the hardliners were trying to portray Plavsic as an isolated figure who was unwilling to compromise . 
Milosevic armed separatist Serb forces in their war against Bosnian independence and the impoverished Bosnian Serb republic still depends on economic ties to Serbian-led Yugoslavia for its survival . 
diplomats say Milosevic has restored links with Karadzic &apos;s allies since he forced them to sign the 1995 Dayton peace accords against their will . 
Plavsic dissolved the Bosnian Serb assembly last week and called for general elections . 
Karadzic loyalists ignored her decision and held an assembly session anyway , rewriting laws to enable her recall and strip her of powers . 
although Plavsic has damaged the hardliners by blowing the whistle on war profiteering , Karadzic &apos;s allies still control a large police force and the official television network . 
Milosevic and Plavsic , longtime political foes , jousted through public statements . 
Plavsic denied she was trying to pit the western part of the Serb republic around the town of Banja Luka against the eastern region ruled from Pale , outside Sarajevo . 
she said that the conflict was about &quot; whether a state governed by law will finally be created here or whether the Serb republic will continue to be the exclusive property of a single party steeped in crime &quot; .
