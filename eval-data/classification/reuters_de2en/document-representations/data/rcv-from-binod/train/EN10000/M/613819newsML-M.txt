brokers in Thailand took a grim view of an official shutdown of the local share market on Monday , many fearing it could further damage the market &apos;s troubled image as prices continue to slide . 
the market &apos;s bellwether SET Index initially opened 1.55 percent down before trading abruptly ground to a halt after the first three minutes . 
the authorities , blaming a computer glitch , said the market would reopen an hour and forty five minutes later at 0445 GMT , but that reopening was delayed until the afternoon session . 
when trading finally resumed , orders failed to go through . 
the exchange said it would try again later in the afternoon for a curtailed session . 
a support fund , set up by local banks , helped the market pare losses near the close , leaving the SET down 2.20 percent , or 12.77 points , at 568.36 on the day . 
some brokers speculated that an unseen hand may have been behind the computer fault on a day when the market was expected to tumble . 
the computer crash followed Friday &apos;s news that a much-touted mega-merger between Thai Danu Bank plc and Finance One plc had failed . 
that news was expected to propel the market lower on Monday . 
local brokers said the breakdown of the computerised and normally efficient Thai market trading system for such a lengthy period of time was unprecedented . 
&quot; It makes Thailand look even worse , &quot; said a trader at a major regional brokerage . 
&quot; This is the worst thing you can do -- stop a bear market in a downturn , &quot; he added . 
&quot; It &apos;s more bad news ... a combination of many things over the last few years would lead someone to have very strong suspicions about this closure . 
the Thai bourse is one of the world &apos;s worst performing exchanges over the last year following a slew of negative economic news . 
you could say people think this is the second time the exchange has been halted this year ... and now maybe they think this is the best way , &quot; said Tanawat Patchimkul , an analyst at Seamico Securities plc . 
the Stock Exchange of Thailand halted trade in finance and bank stocks on March 3 this year while announcing measures to shore up the troubled sector . 
an exchange spokesman said the computer system was having problems on Monday matching sell and buy orders . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think it is possible that the market was ordered to close by anyone . 
but why would they ? 
we have been through situations like this before so there are no fundamental reasons for doing so , &quot; he said . 
the spokesman denied the speculation that the SET intentionally halted trading due to fears about the adverse impact of the failed merger between Thai Danu and Finance One . 
&quot; We really did not want this situation to happen . 
it &apos;s not good for the exchange , &quot; he said .
