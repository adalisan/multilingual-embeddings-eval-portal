Switzerland said on Thursday it had extended a visa for Zaire &apos;s President Mobutu Sese Seko to stay in the country on medical grounds . 
the ailing Mobutu is receiving chemotherapy as an outpatient at Lausanne University Hospital where he was operated on for prostate cancer on August 22 , according to Swiss media . 
Swiss Television on Wednesday night showed recent film of Mobutu slowly walking down a few stairs , with the support of two women , to a white Mercedes outside his luxury hotel in Lausanne . 
it quoted medical sources as saying the Zairean president , who turned 66 last week , would need treatment until the end of the year . 
Mobutu &apos;s spokesman in Kinshasa has denied that the president is receiving chemotheraphy , saying he is convalescing . 
the spokesman declined to discuss details of the secretive leader &apos;s health . 
&quot; Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti has extended the visa for Mr. Mobutu on medical grounds , &quot; foreign ministry spokesman Hans-Ruedi Bortis told Reuters from the Swiss capital , Berne . 
&quot; Each time it is extended it is for a fixed period . 
the current visa was due to expire on Sunday . 
the spokesman said earlier that a decision on extending it would be taken on the basis of medical certificates submitted by doctors treating Mobutu . 
hospital officials have declined to comment on his case . 
Mobutu , who seized power in 1965 after five years of civil war , is one of Africa &apos;s longest-serving strongmen . 
Swiss television has reported that Mobutu , believed to have transferred large sums of money abroad during his rule , had $ 4 billion in banks in Switzerland . 
the third visa renewal in the two months since Mobutu left his homeland comes as his army is battling ethnic Tutsis in Zaire &apos;s volatile eastern region bordering Rwanda and Burundi . 
the fighting has sent 300,000 Rwandan and Burundi refugees fleeing camps , leading the United Nations refugee agency to warn of an impending &quot; humanitarian catastrophe &quot; in Central Africa . 
Swiss members of parliament and media have criticised Mobutu &apos;s presence at the Beau Rivage Hotel in Lausanne , by Lake Geneva . 
the Lausanne weekly magazine Illustre this week estimated the hotel bill for Mobutu and his entourage of 40 aides and bodyguards at close to two million Swiss francs ( $ 1.6 million ) . 
Mobutu &apos;s personal suite at the exclusive hotel , at times occupied by monarchs including Spain &apos;s Juan Carlos and Jordan &apos;s Hussein , was priced at 2,400 swiss francs ( $ 2,000 ) a night . 
&quot; But this time Mobutu , who has stayed before at the Beau Rivage hotel -- a palace -- had to pay in advance , &quot; the magazine said in a report headlined &quot; Mobutu in Lausanne -- The scandal &quot; . 
it said Zaire owed Switzerland three million swiss francs ( $ 2.5 million ) , which represents long-standing debts incurred by Zairean diplomatic missions in Geneva and Berne . 
Mobutu has all meals delivered to his suite , leaving early in the morning for hospital treatment , according to hotel staff . 
&quot; He is hardly visible . 
he spends most of the time in his room or in the hospital having treatment , &quot; one staff member told Reuters . 
Illustre asked why Mobutu was not staying at his sprawling villa at Savigny , on the outskirts of Lausanne . 
however , he has has gone for walks in the villa &apos;s huge garden during his present visit , the magazine said .
