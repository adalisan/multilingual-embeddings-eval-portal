South Korea &apos;s domestic gold demand is expected to remain steady this week on recent weak bullion prices in world markets , but concerns about more corporate failures would limit further rises , traders said on Wednesday . 
&quot; Domestic gold demand was seen steady during recent weeks despite low seasonal demand in summer , &quot; a trader with a major bullion house said . 
current low bullion prices and tightened national security following North Korean defector Hwang Jang-yop &apos;s news conference on July 10 seemed to have depressed smuggling , he said . 
but the trader said financial woes suffered by the Kia and Jinro groups and rumours of cash flow problems in Ssangyong Group would continue to limit any increase in domestic demand . 
another Seoul trader said Kia and Jinro and rumours about the sixth-largest Ssangyong have also cast a shadow over South Korean bullion houses &apos; once lucrative transshipment trade . 
&quot; ( It has ) caused us some difficulties to run our bullion transshipment business as our foreign partners are concerned about the credibilty of our company and even our country , &quot; the trader said . 
last July , South Korea cracked down on booming bullion transshipment trade by shortening the deferred-payment period to a maximum of 30 days from 120 days . 
South Korean bullion houses had imported huge amounts of gold on 90-day deferred payments , then immediately exported the yellow metal , parking the proceeds in high interest-bearing domestic money market instruments . 
meanwhile , most South Korean bullion wholesalers &apos; shops will be closed from August 1 till August 5 for a summer holiday . 
the daily selling price of domestic gold producer LG metals for the precious metal , which is regarded as a benchmark for the local bullion wholesale market , rose on Wednesday to 9,750 won per gram from 9,600 won a week ago . 
the company &apos;s silver price was flat at 139 won per gram over the past week . 
the telegraphic transfer selling rate for customers , posted by the Korea Exchange Bank , fell on Wednesday to 897.00 won against the dollar from 894.30 won a week earlier . 
the rate is regarded as a benchmark of local foreign exchange rates for bullion companies .
