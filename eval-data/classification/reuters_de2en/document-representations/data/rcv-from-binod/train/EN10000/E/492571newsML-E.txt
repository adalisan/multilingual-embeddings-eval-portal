Taiwan &apos;s March consumer price index rose 1.09 percent compared to March 1996 , well below analysts &apos; expectations , the Directorate General of Budget , Accounting and Statistics said on Monday . 
the March wholesale price index was down 3.21 percent compared to a year earlier , the directorate said . 
the monthly consumer price index rise was well below an average forecast for a rise of 2.55 percent compiled from an April 3 Reuters poll of Taiwan economists . 
in February , the consumer price index rose a year-on-year 2.03 percent , while the February wholesale index fell 3.22 percent year-on-year . 
the directorate gave three reasons for the low March CPI figure : a decline in service charges after the mid-February Chinese lunar new year holiday , ample supplies of vegetables and fruits and a decline in pork prices in late March due to an outbreak of hog foot and mouth disease reported on March 20 . 
pork prices across Taiwan plunged by 60 percent or more in the days following the announcmenent as consumers switched to other meats and all but stopped buying pork . 
economists said the pork crisis could be expected to continue to affect consumer prices in April as wholesale pork prices remain severely depressed . 
as for Taiwan &apos;s recent oil price increase , directorate spokesman Chang Teh-tsong said an average 2.97 percent rise put into effect islandwide on Saturday would add 0.13 percentage points to the consumer price index . 
but he gave no period for when the minor increase would have effect and said Taiwan &apos;s full-year 1997 consumer price inflation forecast of 2.7 percent to 2.8 percent would not be affected by the oil price rise . 
Chang said the oil price hike also could be expected to add 0.16 percentage points to the wholesale price index , but again gave no period for the increase and said the full-year forecast for a fall of 1.48 percent would not be affected . 
Chan said low consumer demand for pork following the hog epidemic would continue to have a downward effect on inflation , but the effect would be offset partly by corresponding rises in the prices of other meats . 
&quot; The pork price drop should lower the index somewhat , but its effect is limited , &quot; Chan said .
