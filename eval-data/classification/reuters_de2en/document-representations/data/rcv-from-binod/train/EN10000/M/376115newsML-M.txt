wall Street bulls basked in the glory of the Dow Jones industrial average cracking the 7,000 barrier Thursday , saying further gains were ahead for rampaging stocks . 
although some analysts warned of potential near-term hazards , including Friday &apos;s wholesale inflation data for January , market optimists said the strong economy and corporate profits , coupled with low inflation and favourable interest rates , will drive stocks further into uncharted ground . 
&quot; What I tell everbody today is &apos; Don &apos;t get off the bandwagon , this thing is not over , &apos; &quot; said Ralph Acampora , technical analyst at prudential Securities . 
Acampora was leading the bulls &apos; chest-thumping Thursday as he saw his forecast come to fruition . 
he raised eyebrows back in June 1995 when he forecast the Dow would hit 7,000 in early 1998 . 
at that time the blue chip index stood at around 4,500 . 
saying the bull market has another year of life left , Acampora said the Dow could be as high as 8,250 by year &apos;s end . 
the Dow industrials rose 60.81 points to finish at 7,022.44 on Thursday , topping off a run that saw the blue chip average add 1,000 points in four months . 
cautious investors who had been waiting for a downturn in stocks before making new commitments to the market appear to be surrendering to the bulls , analysts said . 
&quot; They &apos;re scrambling to get invested , &quot; said Joseph Battipaglia , chief investment officer at Gruntal . 
&quot; They see this momentum ... 
they see no natural impediments to it going higher , so they want in . 
one analyst compared the latest buying spree on Wall Street to the frenzy among American parents this past Christmas over the suddenly popular &quot; tickle Me Elmo &quot; doll . 
&quot; Eight weeks ago , parents were willing to pay $ 400 for a doll that was worth $ 25 , &quot; said Charlie crane , director of research at Spears Benzak Salomon and Farrell . 
&quot; Right now people are willing to pay whatever they have to because they feel they have to own stocks . 
Charles Pradillo , market analyst at Cowen and Co . , said the current bull market topped anything he had seen in 30 years on Wall Street . 
&quot; This is big stuff , &quot; he said . 
&quot; This is huge . 
Pradillo said if the economy maintained moderate growth with low inflation and bond yields fall , the Dow could tack on 700 points by the end of the year . 
&quot; If rates continue to come down , this thing is going to continue to go up . 
period , &quot; he said . 
treasuries ended sharply higher on Thursday , with the 30-year bond rising a full point and its yield dropping to 6.63 percent from Wednesday &apos;s 6.71 percent . 
some analysts warned , however , that there could be some bumps ahead that could trip up the bulls . 
the bears &apos; next chance for redemption will come Friday with the release of January producer price data . 
if the number comes in stronger than expected , it could ignite fears of inflation and higher interest rates , they said . 
&quot; If that number is a disappointment tomorrow , this will unravel fairly quickly , &quot; said Battipaglia . 
economists expect January &apos;s producer price index to rise 0.3 percent , compared with a 0.5 percent rise in December .
