Serbia will allow the OSCE to oversee September elections only if the organisation moves to readmit federal Yugoslavia as a member , a top Serbian republic official said on Thursday . 
&quot; OSCE observers have not been invited and will not be invited unless there are parallel activities leading to normalising Yugoslavia &apos;s status in the organisation , &quot; said a spokesman for the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia ( SPS ) . 
Yugoslav membership in the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) was suspended in 1992 when the United Nations imposed an embargo against Belgrade for supporting the Bosnian Serbs in Bosnia &apos;s war . 
most sanctions were lifted after Slobodan Milosevic , then president of Serbia , helped secure the Dayton peace accord in 1995 . 
but Washington preserved an &quot; outer wall &quot; of sanctions , including membership in international organisations , until Belgrade meets several conditions , including respect for human rights and democratic reforms . 
presidential and parliamentary elections in Serbia are scheduled for September 21 . 
some opposition parties have announced a boycott of the elections because they were denied equal access to the media , the voting districts have been configured to favour the SPS , and the authorities refused to invite OSCE observers . 
the biggest , the Serbian Renewal Movement ( SPO ) , broke ranks with the rest of the opposition last week and said it would go ahead . 
other opposition parties accused the SPO of striking a deal with Milosevic , now president of Yugoslavia . 
OSCE monitoring could improve the credibility of voting in Serbia in light of SPS election fraud last November which stole victories by the opposition in Serbia &apos;s 14 biggest municipal districts , including Belgrade . 
the opposition gains were returned only after three months of mass street protests and powerful international pressure . 
it had made a move to stop a crackdown on independent media ahead of the elections but the opposition fears most independent stations will shut down once the voting is over . 
the United States said on Tuesday it opposed a boycott of Serbian elections by opposition parties even though voting conditions are &quot; grossly unfair &quot; . 
special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke , in Belgrade last weekend , backhanded the opposition telling them : &quot; It &apos;s stupid to boycott the elections . 
Holbrooke said he told Milosevic that &quot; over the long term , the support that the international community has for him will be determined by the democratic conditions in Serbia . 
but the U.S. State Department said on Tuesday &quot; it doesn &apos;t appear that he ( Milosevic ) is going to make fundamental changes .
