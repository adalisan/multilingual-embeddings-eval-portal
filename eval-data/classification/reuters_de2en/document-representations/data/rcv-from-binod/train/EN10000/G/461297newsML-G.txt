the White House on Thursday disputed a report that President Clinton &apos;s new nominee to head the Central Intellignce Agency , George Tenet , had leaked the name of a secret CIA informant to the New York Times . 
&quot; We reviewed this matter in great detail prior to Mr. Tenet &apos;s nomination , prior to the president &apos;s announcement , &quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters in Helsinki about the allegation carried Wednesday by the CBS Evening News . 
&quot; We &apos;re confident that Mr. Tenet has conducted himself in a way that fulfils his obligation to protect national security information , &quot; McCurry said . 
on Wednesday , Clinton tapped Tenet , the acting CIA director since December and deputy director since 1995 , after his first choice , Anthony Lake , withdrew denouncing the confirmation process as having become a &quot; political circus . 
at issue in the latest twist was whether Tenet was one of two unnamed senior administration officials cited in a 1995 Times report as confirming that a Guatemalan colonel implicated in two murders had been on the CIA payroll . 
the colonel , Julio Alpirez , was unmasked as a CIA informant by Robert Torricelli , a New Jersey Democrat who was then a House Intelligence Committee member and is now a U.S. senator . 
he who wrote to President Clinton about the matter and spoke to the Times about Alpirez , who was implicated in the murder of one U.S. citizen and the spouse of another . 
in one of his last acts as CIA director , John Deutch upheld a decision last December to revoke the top security clearance of Torricelli &apos;s source for the information about Alpirez , Richard Nuccio , then an adviser in the State Department &apos;s Latin America bureau . 
Nuccio , claiming he had been unfairly victimised by the CIA for his role in the disclosure , has accused Tenet of being one of the two officials cited in the March 22 , 1995 , Times story as having confirmed Alpirez &apos;s identity . 
&quot; What he &apos;s doing is sitting in judgment on me about an issue of which I believe he is , in fact , guilty , &quot; Nuccio said on the CBS television programme &quot; 60 Minutes &quot; last November . 
McCurry said in Helsinki : &quot; We dispute the account that Mr. Nuccio has given . 
CBS &apos;s Mike Wallace , who interviewed Nuccio for the &quot; 60 Minutes &quot; broadcast , reported on Wednesday he had &quot; reconfirmed that George Tenet had in fact given the CIA secrets to The New York Times , something that Tenet absolutely denies . 
Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Bob Kerrey , a Nebraska Democrat , said Thursday that he expected the matter to be raised in confirmation hearings &quot; but unless evidence emerges against Mr. Tenet it will not damage his chances . 
&quot; We have nothing to say about that , &quot; Andrew Rosenthal , Washington editor of the New York Times , said in reply to a query about the matter . 
&quot; We &apos;re not in the habit -- nor do I think any other responsible news organisation is -- of saying who people that we don &apos;t quote by name are , after the fact . 
at his abortive confirmation hearings last week , Lake , Clinton &apos;s first-term national security adviser , condemned unauthorised disclosures of sensitive secrets as &quot; very clearly in the same category as spying . 
Lake said he would &quot; try to find the leakers just as I intend to try to find the spies .
