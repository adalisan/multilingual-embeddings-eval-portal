Graeme Souness , who announced his resignation on Saturday as manager of English premier side Southampton , said during a private visit to Israel he was open to coaching offers for next season . 
&quot; I have nothing arranged , I am now open to offers , &quot; he told Israel Radio after his shock resignation was announced in London through his solicitor . 
&quot; I have been thinking about it ( resigning ) for a long time , &quot; he said in the radio interview . 
&quot; The situation at Southampton had changed , the people who employed me are no longer in charge of the club , there are other people in charge . 
I &apos;m not happy with the situation at the club and therefore decided to resign . 
Eyal Berkovic , the Israeli international who was recruited to the Dell by Souness , said in an interview on Saturday he would definitely follow the manager through the exit door . 
another premier league club , West Ham , are reportedly interested in signing the midfielder .
