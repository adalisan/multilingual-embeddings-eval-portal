Asia &apos;s light crude prices have hit their lowest levels since early 1996 , pummelled by weak refinery margins and lower refinery production , traders said on Friday . 
some producers said the weakness may be reversed in August , as cuts in production at Australia &apos;s Cossack and Griffin fields because of maintenance work tighten spot supplies . 
but most traders said prices could still fall further , unless gasoil prices start to rise to increasing margins . 
&quot; September is a big question mark , but August will most likely remain under pressure , &quot; said a trader with a major oil company in Australia . 
&quot; refining margins are still awful . 
Gasoil is under $ 20.00 . 
why would any refiner want to buy middle distillate rich crudes ? 
&quot; asked a trader with an Australian refinery . 
Asia produces 1.5 million barrels per day ( bpd ) of light sweet crudes , mainly from Malaysia , Australia and Papua New Guinea . 
most of them are priced against Tapis APPI , a bi-weekly benchmark published quote . 
the price of Tapis is currently assessed around $ 19.00 per barrel , the lowest level since January last year . 
just six months ago Tapis was trading at a post Gulf War high of $ 27.68 . 
prompt gas oil in Singapore was assessed Thursday at $ 19.90 per barrel , giving little or no margins for refiners . 
Australian light crudes Cossack and Kutubu are trading currently at two-year lows -- discounts of more than $ 1.00 per barrel under Tapis APPI . 
Cossack and Kutubu usually trade at discounts of around 60 to 70 cents to Tapis APPI . 
Asia &apos;s light crude prices started falling in May when refiners started shut downs of refinery units to carry out maintenance . 
in June , Mobil shut down a 55,000 barrels-per-day crude distillation unit ( CDU ) at it 115,000 bpd Altona refinery in Australia for maintenance . 
plans to shut down Indonesia &apos;s 200,000-bpd Balikpapn refinery , and Shell Australia &apos;s 74,000 bpd CDU at its 115,000 bpd Geelong refinery also sharply reduced Asian demand for light crudes . 
depressed refinery margins in Asia as a result of falling gasoil prices aggravated the thin demand for light grades , while cargoes of light sweet West African crudes heading to Asia , attracted by a narrow Brent / Dubai , competed with regional crudes . 
&quot; The weakness was a combination of refinery shutdown , bad margins and West African competition , &quot; said trader is Singapore . 
sharp falls in the Brent crude price narrowed the Brent / Dubai spread by half to 50 cents in early June , compared to a month before , making Brent priced crudes more attractive to Asian refiners . 
this resulted in spot purchases of over 650,000 bpd of crudes from the west , which are scheduled to arrive in August . 
refiners say that unless refinery margins improve , prices will remain under a lot of pressure . 
&quot; Admittedly there are some refineries that will be coming back onstream . 
but with refining margins still bad and products getting thrashed , I would say there is little incentive to increase refining rates , &quot; said a trader with a major oil company . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think any of the Australian refiners are running at full capacity , &quot; said trader in Australia .
