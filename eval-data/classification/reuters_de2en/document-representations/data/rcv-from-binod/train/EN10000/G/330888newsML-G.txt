jury selection was completed Friday in the murder trial of millionaire chemicals heir John du Pont , clearing the way for opening statements to begin Monday . 
&quot; I never had any doubt we &apos;d get a fair jury in Delaware County , &quot; defence attorney Thomas Bergstrom told reporters after selection of six alternate jurors was completed Friday . 
Bergstrom said he would spend the weekend working on his opening statement . 
du Pont , 58 , is charged with first and third degree murder in the January 26 , 1996 slaying of Olympic champion wrestler David Schultz on du Pont &apos;s Foxcatcher estate in suburban Philadelphia &apos;s Delaware County . 
his lawyers have said they would pursue an insanity defence . 
questioning of jurors in the selection process often focused on the heavy publicity given the case in the Philadelphia area . 
the six men and six women named to the regular jury range in age from 32 to 72 . 
there are 11 white members and one black .
