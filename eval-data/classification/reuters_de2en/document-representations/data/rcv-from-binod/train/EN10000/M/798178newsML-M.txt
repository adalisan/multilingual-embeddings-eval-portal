Turkey &apos;s Ceyhan oil terminal officials said on Wednesday that the first tanker to lift Iraqi oil under the second term of the oil-for-food deal had not yet begun loadings and was waiting off the port . 
&quot; The tanker Arcadia is still waiting off the port and I don &apos;t expect any loading today . 
there seems to be a delay , &quot; terminal manager Fatih Sen told Reuters . 
another official said the delay could put forward the first loading &quot; as late as this weekend . 
the officials did not elaborate . 
the Arcadia has been waiting off Ceyhan since Monday to lift 2.1 million barrels of Iraqi Kirkuk crude for U.S. trader Bayoil , according to the preliminary lifting schedule . 
Iraq plans to sell about 1.5 million barrels per day until September 5 , when the first 90-days of the second six-month oil-for-food deal expires .
