IPE October gas oil futures closed on a firm note following the expiry of the September contract on Thursday , but Brent provided the main impetus for the rally which took prices to post-Gulf War highs , brokers said . 
October gas oil closed up $ 3.25 at $ 219.75 per tonne after the September contract touched a post-Gulf War high of $ 226.75 before expiry . 
&quot; Brent was the real leader today , but gas oil held up well , &quot; a gas oil broker said . 
Brent was 12 cents higher at $ 23.70 per barrel at the gas oil close , having touched a high of $ 24.39 . 
September gas oil expired with a modest delivery of 155,300 tonnes against outstanding positions . 
October took up the prompt month reins , increasing its backwardation against November by $ 1.00 to $ 7.00 per tonne . 
the October Brent / gas oil spread closed around $ 5.70 per barrel , steady on the past week . 
Brent swung wildly over more than $ 1 per barrel range during the day , driven up by mounting tension between Iraq and the U.S. and beaten back by a wave of profit-taking , brokers said . 
prices peaked on fears that Iraq might mount an assault against Kuwait after the latter agreed to serve as an air base for an expected U.S. strike against Iraq . 
a wave of profit-taking wiped $ 1 , but prices recovered when Iraqi state television said its air defence systems fired three missiles against U.S. aircraft patrolling the southern &quot; no-fly zone . 
the Pentagon later said it had no reports of any missile firings .
