two U.S. Navy amphibious landing craft sank in separate incidents off the coast of the southern Japanese island of Okinawa on Monday but nobody was hurt , a U.S. Navy spokesman said . 
the first LARC ( landing amphibious Resupply cargo Vessel ) sank in waters off Camp Schwab on the Pacific coast of Okinawa , said Chief petty Officer Al Fontenot at the U.S. Navy &apos;s Japanese headquarters at Yokosuka . 
the cause of the first sinking was not known , Fontenot said . 
the crew members then transferred on to a second LARC which also sank after developing engine and steering problems . 
the crews from the two craft were then plucked out of the water by a rescue ship , Fontenot said . 
Fontenot said he did not know how many people were aboard the two craft at the time of the incidents or if they were taking part in an exercise .
