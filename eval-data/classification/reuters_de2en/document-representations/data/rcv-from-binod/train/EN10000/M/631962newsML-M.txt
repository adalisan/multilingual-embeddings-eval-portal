the Norwegian crown strengthened against the German mark on modest buying early on Monday . 
against the mark the crown was at 4.1530 compared with 4.1650 on Friday . 
&quot; We &apos;ve seen some modest buying this morning , which is why we are up but the activity is very modest . 
the move is very small , &quot; said an Oslo-based dealer . 
others said the Norwegian currency would see little direct impact from events in Europe although uncertainty over plans and the timing of a single European currency could indirectly affect the petrocurrency over the next few weeks . 
&quot; There are two outlooks at the moment , one that the EMU will go ahead but it will be soft , or the other that it will be delayed . 
the outlook for the Norwegian crown against the mark depends on which scenario is more dominant and therefore the direction of the mark , &quot; said a London-based dealer . 
&quot; I think Germany is going to take a harder line on EMU criteria , which will mean a stronger mark and therefore the ( Norwegian ) crown will stay defensive against the mark . 
but I think the crown will look better against other European currencies and will strengthen against , say , the French franc and the Belgian franc and the peseta , &quot; he said . 
in an interview with the daily Aftenposten on Monday , Heinrich Schembecker , head of Germany &apos;s third largest bank Commerzbank , said he expected the Norwegian crown to strengthen after the introduction of the euro . 
Norway is entering a situation which resembles the earlier Swiss case . 
the crown will become a safehaven currency , not in a big scale , but it will become one , &quot; Schembecker said . 
another possible influence on the crown this week was the release of first-quarter national accounts by the government department Statistics Norway . 
analysts said figures for first-quarter GDP growth were expected to be weaker than in the fourth quarter last year . 
&quot; That could cause a slight weakening of the crown . 
the market might use the data as a signal to sell , &quot; one said .
