a duel between the dominant short and long on the November IPE gas oil contract intensified on Tuesday when the short , Monte Carlo-based AIC , said the long was being excessively slow to take delivery on the Rotterdam region barge market , a trader at AIC said . 
&quot; They are falling well short of picking up the oil , &quot; the AIC trader said by telephone , referring to the long , trading house Cargill International SA . 
&quot; But nobody will know this until tomorrow . 
that is the last day of the first five-day delivery window . 
officials at Cargill declined to comment . 
the AIC trader said AIC was making 627,800 tonnes delivery of gas oil November 16-30 , split into three five day periods but declined to say how much of that oil was due in the first November 16-20 period , which expires on Wednesday . 
traders say that if either or both parties on an IPE futures delivery is accused of defaulting the exchange normally convenes an arbitration between the two and the defaulting party is required to compensate the counterparty and must also sometimes pay a fine to the IPE . 
traders have said Cargill had established a large long position in November gas oil futures , betting that AIC , which has a large short position , would not be able to deliver into its commitments and therefore buy back its position at a higher price . 
the November contract expiry was a record high 865,1000 tonnes . 
the AIC trader added : &quot; They have to come with more nominations in order to complete the first five day delivery period . 
&quot; They have some oil to lift and they have one day to lift it and it is a large quanitity . 
there is an amount that they have to lift and it would be difficult to lift by tomorrow . 
we are making the delivery . 
the oil is there , and we are waiting for them to give us nominations to lift it .
