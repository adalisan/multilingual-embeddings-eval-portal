Spanish inflation could end the year below the government &apos;s 3.4-percent target following benign October data released on Thursday , analysts said . 
&quot; I think we could be below the official target by the end of the year , &quot; said Xavier Segura , research director at Caja Cataluna . 
Spain &apos;s consumer price index ( CPI ) rose 0.1 in October versus the previous month for a 3.5 percent year-on-year rate . 
core inflation gained 0.2 percent on the month and up 3.2 percent year-on-year . 
this compared with consensus forecasts for a 0.2-percent monthly rise , according to a Reuters poll . 
October inflation might have been even lower if international energy prices were not so buoyant , analysts said . 
the energy component , usually volatile , could hamper improvement in headline inflation if crude prices remain on an uptrend , they said . 
&quot; ( The CPI ) is good news if the petrol prices really stabilise on the downside , &quot; said Valentin Fernandez , economist at Credit Lyonnais Securities in Madrid . 
but because the energy factor is international , all countries should see the same effect , and this should not damage Spain &apos;s performance relative to the European Union , they said . 
the food component performed compared to a year ago , when the component had to account for a strong rise in olive oil prices in October 1995 . 
food prices this year also dropped amid bumper harvests in the first year of heavy rainfall following a prolonged drought . 
fresh food prices fell 0.3 percent in October from September . 
within this component , processed food prices were flat from the previous month and fresh food fell 0.8 percent . 
the downtrend should continue this year , analysts said . 
they expected the Bank of Spain to cut interest rates again from the current 6.75 percent but were divided on the timing . 
&quot; The Bank of Spain won &apos;t cut rates again until inflation goes below 3.0 percent , &quot; said an analyst at a major Madrid brokerage . 
but others saw further monetary easing in 1996 . 
&quot; The ( central bank ) has room to cut by 25 basis point before the year-end , &quot; said Caja Cataluna &apos;s Segura .
