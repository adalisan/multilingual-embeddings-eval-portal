Spain will let the Supreme Court examine , but not use as proof , secret files purporting to show the former Socialist administration ran a &quot; dirty war &quot; against Basque separatist rebels , officials said on Friday . 
the court had asked to look at the military intelligence files before making a decision on whether to demand the 18 documents be declassified as requested by lower courts investigating the campaign that killed 28 people in the 1980s . 
&quot; The government has authorised the transfer of the documents , thus fulfilling its promise to cooperate with the judicial powers , &quot; the government spokesman Miguel Angel Rodriguez told a news conference . 
&quot; They will be seen in a confidential and guarded way by the magistrates and they will maintain their classified status . 
he said the papers would be delivered to the court under high security next Wednesday at 5 p.m. ( 1600 GMT ) . 
the documents , which have been leaked to the media and published in two newspapers , are at the heart of a high-level case in which former Socialist ministers are charged with setting up and running the &quot; dirty war &quot; . 
they consist of office memos and internal documents from the spy service . 
one of the key papers shows that the seal used to identify the Anti-Terrorist Groups ( GAL ) , which waged a campaign of murder , torture , bombing and kidnapping from 1983 to 1987 , was designed by people within the service . 
the files also describe military intelligence activity in the south of France -- where most of the GAL activity took place -- during 1984 . 
they cannot be used as proof in court until verified by the government and declassified . 
the conservative government of Jose Maria Aznar decided last August , as the Socialist government before it had , to keep the files secret for state security reasons . 
but the government has said it will respect the final decision of the Supreme Court . 
&quot; We have taken a political decision that is within our mandate as a government , and this decision is immovable , &quot; Deputy Prime Minister Francisco Alvarez-Cascos said on Spanish radio . 
&quot; If a judicial power now decides that the political decision of the government from a judicial point of view is not legal , then the courts &apos; agreement will affect the declassification of the papers .
