the Sri Lankan navy attacked a Tamil Tiger guerrilla sea base on the island &apos;s northeastern coast early on Wednesday , destroying a large number of rebel boats , military officials in the east said . 
several navy fast attack craft and gunboats took part in the pre-dawn attack , which caused heavy damage to a Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam &apos;s ( LTTE ) &quot; Sea Tigers &quot; base near the fishing village of Chalai in northeastern Mullaitivu district , they said . 
&quot; There were more than 40 ( rebel ) boats on shore . 
most of them should have been damaged by the attack , &quot; an official told Reuters . 
he said they were unsure of rebel casualties . 
there were no naval casualties , he added . 
an LTTE spokesman in London was not immediately available for comment . 
sea Tigers form the naval wing of the LTTE , who are fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka &apos;s north and east . 
the government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war , now in its 14th year .
