Christchurch , Feb 19 - New Zealand will need to bounce back quickly for the one-day cricket series against England , starting at Christchurch on Thursday , after losing back-to-back tests against England . 
the one-day series starts with the inaugural day-night international at a packed Lancaster Park . 
England wrapped up the test series with a four-wicket win in the third test yesterday and now set their sights on making up for their poor performances in the limited-overs matches in Zimbabwe earlier in their winter tour . 
Zimbabwe won all three matches in the first leg of England &apos;s tour and the English players were roundly castigated for their efforts . 
now the momentum is with them as they look to maintain their hold on the kiwis . 
new Zealand have won 19 and lost 21 of their 43 one-dayers against England , the most recent being the last occasion the teams met , in the opening game of the World Cup in India , Pakistan and Sri Lanka early last year . 
Lancaster Park is usually a bouncy , fast pitch , ideal for high scoring in limited-overs matches . 
Nathan Astle will return to open the batting with Bryan Young after occupying a middle order spot during the test series , while Adam Parore -- a week ago cast out of the national side -- is set to be at No 3 . 
the New Zealand 12 is light on specialist batsmen , with Chris Cairns , Harris and captain Lee Germon -- restored to fitness after missing the third test with a groin injury -- having key roles in the middle of the innings . 
England will be tempted to stay with the combination which won the second and third tests . 
however tomorrow &apos;s strip was used for the test here and will be slower paced than normally the case here . 
that means it &apos;s likely the medium pace bowlers who have served New Zealand well in the past will again be instrumental figures . 
Slow-medium trio Chris Harris , Nathan Astle and Gavin Larsen are all in the New Zealand 12 , with the likelihood that one of the three faster bowlers , Simon Doull , Heath Davis or Geoff Allott drop out tomorrow . 
they have six specialist batsmen , and three bowlers who are highly competent with the bat , Dominic Cork , Robert Croft and Darren Gough . 
Fast-medium Andrew Caddick has done a tight-fisted job with the ball since being recalled for the second test but left arm spinner Phil Tufnell could make way for one of the allrounders , Craig White or Ronnie Irani . 
the match will be the first under lights at Lancaster Park and with half the New Zealand 12 coming from Canterbury there &apos;ll be plenty of home town support . 
new Zealand have a day off today , to rest up after the third test , although they might have a light fielding session under lights tonight . 
England &apos;s fielding during the test series has been excellent and will be looking to carry that on in the one-dayers .
