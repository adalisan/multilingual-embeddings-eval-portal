Hong Kong protesters prepared to board a rusty tanker on Sunday bound for disputed islands in the East China Sea to play cat-and-mouse with Japanese warships and try to assert China &apos;s sovereignty over the isles . 
Japan has claimed sovereign rights to the islands -- known in Japanese as the Senkakus and the Diaoyus in Chinese -- and refused to acknowledge that the dispute is still open for discussion with China . 
Tokyo &apos;s claim dates to 1895 , when Japan defeated China and seized Taiwan and other territories . 
China has claimed sovereignty over the islands for centuries . 
the 2,800-tonne cargo tanker , Kien Hwa 2 , carrying 18 anti-Japanese activists , 19 crew and 42 journalists and photographers , was expected to sail out of Hong Kong harbour at 3.00 pm ( 0700 GMT ) for a three-day journey to the rocky outcrop . 
a big banner emblazoned across the bow of the ship boldly stated the mission &apos;s intention . 
&quot; We , the Chinese people , request that you , the Japanese , leave Chinese waters , &quot; it said . 
&quot; We will use every tactic and every strategy , such as hide-and-seek , to dodge the Japanese patrol boats and get onto those islands to raise the Chinese flag and restore our sovereignty , &quot; said David Chan , convenor of the Alliance of the Worldwide Chinese for the Protection of the Diaoyu Islands . 
as the protesters prepared to board the vessel , Chan held aloft the big Chinese national flag he intends to firmly embed on the islands , and led his supporters in singing the Chinese national anthem . 
his mission would not obey any orders to turn back if confronted by Japanese warships , he said . 
&quot; We are civilians , we have no weapons , no explosives , and our ship is only a cargo ship , it &apos;s not armed . 
we will not retreat , &quot; Chan told Reuters . 
the protesters would use two rubber dinghies to try to beguile Japanese coast guard vessels . 
&quot; There may be five Japanese warships patrolling those waters around the islands , but it will not be so easy to catch us . 
&quot; We know this could be dangerous , but this is Chinese territory , and we have every right to land there , &quot; Chan said . 
&quot; So what can the Japanese do to stop us ? 
Japanese coast guard vessels have already turned back at least three vessels attempting similiar missions . 
Tokyo &apos;s claim to the islands has whipped up anti-Japanese fervour in the tiny British colony , culminating in almost daily protest action . 
both countries claim the islands have been theirs for centuries . 
the wave of patriotic nationalism in the territory , due to be handed back to China next year after more than 150 years of British rule , has united usually opposing political forces , bridging the divide between pro-Beijing groups and anti-communist democrats .
