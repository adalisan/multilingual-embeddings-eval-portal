France &apos;s Constitutional Council on Wednesday struck down two provisions of a new law clamping down on illegal immigration in a rebuke to the centre-right government a month before a snap parliamentary election . 
the constitutional watchdog said the provisions , including one allowing police access to the fingerprints of applicants for political asylum , breached the constitution . 
the Council also threw out a provision allowing authorities to withdraw the residence rights of long-time residents whose presence was deemed a danger to public order . 
it said the provision was unconstitutional if the foreigner resided in France for 10 years , a duration which would establish multiple links with the country and entitle the resident to family life in France . 
nevertheless , hardline Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre declared the ruling a victory for his law , passed last month by the conservative-dominated parliament against strong left-wing opposition and protests from intellectuals and artists . 
the opposition Socialists had sought to have the entire law declared unconstitutional , and Debre said the council had struck down only two minor provisions and &quot; the government can only be happy with the approval of the core of the reform &quot; .
