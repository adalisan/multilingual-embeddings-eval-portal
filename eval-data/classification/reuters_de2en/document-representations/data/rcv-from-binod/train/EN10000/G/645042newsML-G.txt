Group leaders Ukraine held European champions Germany to a scoreless draw in their World Cup European group nine qualifier on Saturday . 
dynamo Kiev striker Serhiy Rebrov had the best chance for the home team but his powerful shot from about 16 metres hit a post just before halftime . 
the Germans started well but settled down after 10 minutes and rarely threatened Oleksander Shovkovsky &apos;s goal . 
a Juergen Klinsmann header in the first half , which went wide , and a Thomas Helmer long range effort which Shovkovsky saved in the second accounted for the Germans &apos; main offensive opportunities . 
Ukraine still lead the group with 14 points after eight games , with Germany two points off the lead but with two games in hand . 
Ukraine , six years after their emergence as an independent sporting nation after the collapse of the Soviet Union , had a fair chance of making a name if they could have capitalised on their possession to upset the European champions . 
the home side dominated for most of the first half and later in the second , trying to redeem themselves after a 1-1 home draw against Armenia last month that dealt a serious blow to their chances of making their first ever big tournament finals . 
the Germans , still odds on favourites to win the group after a comfortable 2-0 win over Ukraine in Bremen in April , seemed content to sit back and make do with a point away from home . 
Klinsmann and Kirsten , Germany &apos;s upfront duo , were given little room for manoevre and did little to worry a well-organised back line based around players from Ukrainian champions dynamo Kiev .
