a Wisconsin Assembly committee has advanced proposals to change the state &apos;s income tax bracketing system and increase tax credits for married couples , a legislative aide said Thursday . 
the Income Tax Review Committee voted 5-0 to advance the proposals Wednesday , said Michael Rasmussen , a research aide to Rep. Frank G. Lasee , R-Ledgeview . 
one proposal would index the individual income tax brackets and allowed deductions for inflation beginning in the tax year 1998 . 
according to analyst Kelsie Doty with the Legislative Fiscal Bureau , the proposal would cost Wisconsin $ 11.8 million in fiscal 1998 and $ 43 million in fiscal 1999 with further increases as additional adjustments were made . 
Wisconsin is expected to collect $ 4.55 billion in individual income taxes for fiscal 1997 and $ 4.81 billion in fiscal 1998 , Doty noted . 
the second proposal would increase the income tax credit for married couples from a maximum of $ 300 currently to $ 420 by tax year 2000 . 
the proposed increase would cost Wisconsin $ 12 million in fiscal 1998 and $ 32 million in fiscal 1999 , Doty found . 
the credit currently is estimated to cost Wisconsin $ 153.9 million in fiscal 1997 , $ 159.3 million in fiscal 1998 and $ 164.6 million in fiscal 1999 , Doty noted . 
Wisconsin senators are currently reviewing a proposed budget for the fiscal biennium beginning July 1 . 
neither proposal has been included in the budget , but could be added to it , Rasmussen said .
