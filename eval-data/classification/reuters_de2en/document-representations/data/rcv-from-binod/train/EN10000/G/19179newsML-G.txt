Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro on Wednesday dispelled rumours she was going to resign after undergoing surgery on her lower spinal column . 
doctors at Johns Hopkins Medical Institute in Baltimore successfully operated on Chamorro on Monday to correct a chronic spinal infection called osteomyelitis , which had caused her pain in her back and right leg . 
her outlook for a complete recovery was &quot; excellent &quot; but she would require continued antibiotic treatment , doctors said . 
she was expected to be discharged in one week and would be able to return to Nicaragua in 10 days , doctors said . 
Chamorro , 66 , suffers from osteoporosis , a disease that weakens the bones , and has repeatedly flown to Baltimore for treatment . 
she will end her term in office in January after almost seven years as president .
