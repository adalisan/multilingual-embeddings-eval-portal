the won closed slightly weaker against the dollar on Monday as the market favoured the U.S. currency in line with the rise of the dollar versus the Japanese yen in the world market , dealers said . 
the won stood at 828.70 at the close after opening at 828.30 . 
it ranged between 827.80 and 829.50 . 
expected import settlements and dollar short-covering pushed the won down in early morning , traders said . 
however , much of the loss was erased later as import deals failed to materialise and expectations of month-end export deals loomed . 
in late trading , the won started to lose ground again in late trading as the dollar / yen rose above 112 , dealers said . 
but dollar profit-taking prevented the local unit from falling further . 
the won is likely to move in a range of 827.00 to 829.50 on Tuesday . 
the central bank set the base mid-rate at 828.50 for Tuesday , unchanged from Monday &apos;s .
