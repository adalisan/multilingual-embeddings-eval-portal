U.S. municipal bonds mostly were unchanged in late trade on Monday , as the market shifted into neutral while it waited to see if the Federal Reserve would raise rates when its policy makers meet Tuesday . 
asked what sort of activity he saw in the market , a trader replied : &quot; precious little . 
we &apos;re going to wait on the Fed . 
&quot; He added that a couple of bid-wanted lists attracted aggressive bids . 
traders also were looking ahead to Nevada &apos;s sale of $ 285 million of general obligation ( GOS ) bonds on Tuesday , a sizable amount of paper for the state . 
a trader said he expected the deal to get a reasonably good bid . 
&quot; But $ 285 milion is a lot of GOS for Nevada people to chew through . 
and on Wednesday , New York City taps the debt market with the sale of around $ 740 million of general obligation bonds , and traders noted that its offerings typically attract solid interest from retail buyers . 
a New York City official , who declined to be named , said that orders still were being added up in the second day of the presale period . 
whether the central bank opt to raise interest rates also might have a major impact on individual investors &apos; appetite for municipal bonds . 
those who think the long end would fall if the Federal Reserve opts for its second tightening in a year , said the move could spur retail interest . 
we &apos;d get a lot more retail interest if we get ( a yield ) back behind 7.0 percent , &quot; a trader said . 
the potential market impact cuts both ways , however , as traders said that if the Federal Reserve holds the line , disapppointment and tensions ahead of its next meeting in July also could drive up rates . 
in the secondary market , Orange County , Florida , School Borad of 2017 , which have a 5-3 / 8 percent coupon , were bid at 5.64 percent , unchanged . 
and Delaware River Port Authority of Pennsylvania and New Jersey revenues of 2026 , which carry a 5-1 / 2 percent coupon , were bid at 5.68 percent , also flat . 
June municipal bond futures traded on the Chicago Board of Trade rose four ticks to 116-17 / 32 , while the June U.S. Treasury bonds fell two ticks to 109-29 / 32 .
