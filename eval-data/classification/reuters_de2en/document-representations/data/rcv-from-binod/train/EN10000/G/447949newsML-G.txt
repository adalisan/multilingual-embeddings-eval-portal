a Greek Cypriot fisherman has been charged with infecting his British former lover with the AIDS virus , Cyprus police said on Monday . 
Pavlos Georgiou , 40 , is the first person to be prosecuted in Cyprus for spreading AIDS and faces a maximum prison sentence of two years , a 1,500 pound ( $ 2,900 ) fine , or both . 
his former lover , 44-year-old Briton Janette pink , has developed AIDS and doctors say she only has a few months to live , according to British newspaper reports . 
police said Georgiou , from the beach resort of Ayia Napa , was charged with violating a law that refers to &quot; spreading of contagious diseases either unlawfully or negligently &quot; . 
&quot; He said anything he has to say he will say in court , &quot; a police spokesman told Reuters . 
&quot; In a previous statement Georgiou has said that his accuser knew of his condition . 
no date has been set for the trial . 
she has also said the fisherman concealed from her the death of his wife from AIDS . 
Georgiou has denied the accusations . 
in an interview with a local magazine last year he said his dead wife &apos;s family had told pink that he was HIV-positive but she had said she did not care . 
prosecutors hope pink will be able to come to Cyprus for the trial despite her illness . 
Cyprus law does not allow her to testify on video to save her the trip . 
the &quot; contagious diseases &quot; provision was only enforced once before this century to fight the spread of cholera and typhoid on the island .
