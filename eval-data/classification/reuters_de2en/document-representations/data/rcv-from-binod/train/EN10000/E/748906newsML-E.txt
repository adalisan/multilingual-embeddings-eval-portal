Kazakhstan &apos;s gross domestic product ( GDP ) will grow next year by three percent , marking a third year of expansion , the ex-Soviet state &apos;s government said in its macroeconomic forecast for 1998 . 
&quot; By the end of 1998 GDP is forecast to rise in real terms by three percent , compared to 1997 , &quot; said the economic analysis attached to a government order outlining the main budget and financial targets for 1998 and obtained by Reuters . 
last year the resource-rich Central Asian republic &apos;s GDP grew by a moderate 1.1 percent -- for the first time since the country five times the size of France and populated by just 16.7 million people plunged into a severe crisis in 1991 . 
this year &apos;s GDP is officially targeted to grow by two percent . 
&quot; Monetary and credit policy in 1998 ... will be aimed at slashing annual inflation to less than 10 percent , &quot; the document said . 
inflation was 28.7 percent last year . 
in the first six months of this year consumer prices grew by 6.7 percent , and the National Bank has said inflation could fall below its 1997 target of 17 percent . 
the national tenge currency has been stable at around 75 per dollar since January this year , and &quot; due to the steady fall of inflation and the tenge &apos;s stability the National Bank &apos;s refinancing rate could fall to 13-14 percent annual by the end of 1998 , &quot; the government said . 
trailing low inflation , the National Bank cut its refinancing rate on July 1 to 21 percent annual from 24 percent . 
the government also said that the share of the state sector in Kazakhstan &apos;s GDP would fall to 25 percent next year . 
an official from the National Statistics Agency told Reuters state companies produced 40.6 percent of GDP last year . 
the government , which has managed to attract billions of dollars of direct foreign investment to an economy dominated by extracting and heavy industries , has repeatedly pledged to continue rapid sell-offs of oil and gas , metals and power firms to foreigners . 
the 1998 budget , which will be debated by the parliament in the autumn , is targeted by the government at a deficit of 64.53 billion tenge ( $ 851 million ) , or 3.2 percent of GDP . 
last year &apos;s budget had a gap of 2.9 percent . 
this year &apos;s deficit -- targeted initially at 3.16 percent of GDP -- is likely to widen to 3.90 percent , after the legislature reconsidered in May some budget items to help pay off by January the state &apos;s debts to pensioners reaching 36 billion tenge .
