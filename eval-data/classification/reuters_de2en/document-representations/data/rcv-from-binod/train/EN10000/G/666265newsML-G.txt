six people were killed and more than 21 wounded , including six policemen , in fighting and attacks in southern Albania , state-run news agency ATA said on Tuesday . 
five men and a woman were killed and 14 people , including some women , were injured in a battle over land in the southern village of Kapinove on Monday , ATA said . 
it quoted district police headquarters as saying the clash happened when three related men went to the village to try to resolve a land dispute with another family . 
separately , ATA said six Albanian policemen and a passer-by were wounded on Tuesday after gunmen shot at them with heavy weapons on a road in the southern district of Berat . 
ATA quoted an Interior Ministry spokesman as saying the gunmen opened fire with automatic and anti-tank weapons on a police van and armoured personnel carrier near Ure Vajgurore in Berat . 
it gave no more details . 
Socialist Party chairman Fatos Nano , campaigning in the area , was delayed by locals near Ure Vajgurore for a short while . 
Party officials told Reuters that citizens of the town were defending themselves from a threatened attack by gangs . 
in Fier , some 50 km ( 30 miles ) west of Berat , Nano was forced to stage an election rally inside a sports hall as police said they could not guarantee his security in the town square , a Reuters photographer said . 
tension is mounting as Albania prepares for snap elections on June 29 . 
on Monday a car carrying Socialist party officials was shot at in the north of the country . 
more than 1,000 people have been killed and thousands wounded since Albanians looted more than a million guns amid chaotic scenes after the collapse of fraudulent investment schemes earlier this year .
