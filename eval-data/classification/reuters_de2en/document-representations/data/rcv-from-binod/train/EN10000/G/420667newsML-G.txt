eight university lecturers charged with sedition and arson in the eastern Nigerian city of Enugu were granted bail , local newspapers reported on Wednesday . 
&quot; There is nothing before me to establish why they should be refused bail , &quot; Justice Isah Magaji , chairman of the Miscellaneous Offences Tribunal said on Tuesday in a ruling the prosecution had vehemently opposed . 
the lecturers who teach at the University of Nigeria , Nsukka , in the east face possible life sentences if convicted . 
they include a professor and are accused of inciting student riots last month . 
ten others detained at the time have been freed unconditionally . 
Military-ruled Nigeria frequently uses tribunals headed by high court judges with police and military officers as members to try riot cases . 
in 1995 , nine minority rights activists including writer Ken Saro-Wiwa were found guilty of murder by a tribunal and swiftly hanged , drawing worldwide outrage . 
two United Nations human rights investigators who were to visit Nigeria in February cancelled their trip after the government denied them access to jails and political detainees .
