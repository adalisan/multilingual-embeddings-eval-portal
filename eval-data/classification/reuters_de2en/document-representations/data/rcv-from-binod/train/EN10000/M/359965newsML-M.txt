Croatian stocks were mixed in buoyant activity on Thursday , and traders said all liquid issues were poised for further gains amid growing interest from foreign investors . 
&quot; Trends are positive at the moment . 
there is no euphoria but all stocks are slowly moving upwards , &quot; said Damir Cikotic of Faktor brokerage . 
ten of 17 traded issues rose , six fell and one was flat . 
volume was almost three times higher at 26,118 shares , turnover also rose to 13.1 million kuna . 
&quot; Recent ratings ( awarded to Croatia ) opened up some directions for foreign investors , &quot; said Marijana Reskovac of Karlovacka Banka , noting their increased demand for Istrian hotel stocks and food processor Podravka . 
shares in Privredna Banka , currently undergoing an overhaul , were in demand on Thursday , making it top gainer of the day . 
it jumped 110 kuna to 260 from January with 7,055 units sold . 
traders said this seemed to be an agreed deal and they did not expect Privredna to trade regularly on the Zagreb bourse , especially not in such large volumes . 
Podravka , selling 7,396 shares , was most actively traded stock and gained five kuna to close at 355 . 
Reskovac did not expect it to rise significantly in the near future . 
the fully-listed issues , drugs firm Pliva and Zagrebacka Banka , were among decliners . 
Pliva dipped eight kuna to 472 with 1,565 units sold and Zagrebacka lost 30 kuna to 1,830 on volume of 2,478 shares . 
Zagrebacka E-series preference stock added 15 kuna to 1,065 , with 257 shares sold and its bearer C-series traded flat at 730 kuna but only one share was sold . 
&quot; Whenever interest shifts to some other stock , price of Pliva and Zagrebacka goes down a bit , &quot; said Reskovac . 
still , she did not expect the two to fall , but rather to fluctuate around their current price .
