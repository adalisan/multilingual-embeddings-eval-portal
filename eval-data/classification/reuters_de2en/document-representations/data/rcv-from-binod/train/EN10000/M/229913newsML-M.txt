the price of China &apos;s Daqing crude oil for November lifting to Japanese customers has been calculated at $ 22.05 per barrel , down 56 cents from $ 22.61 in October , traders said on Monday . 
the Daqing price is linked to the average of Indonesia &apos;s official prices for Minas and Cinta crudes and their spot market prices . 
the average of official prices accounts for 50 percent of the Daqing price , and the average of spot prices for the remainder . 
Japanese lifters , comprising oil refiners and utility companies , imported 8.9 million to 9.3 million tonnes of Daqing crude per year between 1991 and 1995 . 
Japanese buyers have accepted a Chinese offer to allocate six million to eight million tonnes per year for 1996-2000 . 
China reviews its Daqing export volume every five years .
