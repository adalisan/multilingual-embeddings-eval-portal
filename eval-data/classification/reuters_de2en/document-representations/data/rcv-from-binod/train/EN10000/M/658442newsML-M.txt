Gulf gas oil shared the global weakness in middle distillates on Thursday and appeared set to trade at a slight discount to published price quotations for the first time this year . 
Gulf-based traders said that June gas oil cargoes had traded at parity to the published quote which was talked at around $ 21.50 a barrel fob , its lowest-level for 12 months . 
&quot; It &apos;s getting very close to a discount ... For last decade June it could go below , &quot; said one trader . 
premiums were still possible for Gulf gas oil cargoes for first half July delivery , particularly those for those cargoes which were slated for India and which were shielded from Mediterranean cargoes because of a closed arbitrage . 
cargoes have traded as high as a 30 premium this month . 
but the outlook for gas oil and jet remained bearish given oversupply and brimming stocks in Singapore , traders said . 
gas oil was a $ 1 premium to independent price quotes in June 1996 .
