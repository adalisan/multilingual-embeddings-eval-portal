SIMEX Euroyen and Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures were easier on Thursday following the Bank of Japan &apos;s ( BOJ ) move to leave a lower-than-expected surplus in the money market after the previous day &apos;s injection . 
the BOJ drained 500 billion yen from the market in its regular morning operation , leaving a surplus of 70 billion yen , after Wednesday &apos;s surplus of 300 billion yen . 
&quot; The UC ( unsecured call loan rate ) popped back above 0.50 percent after their operation , &quot; said a dealer with a European futures house . 
it would have been no sweat for them to drain 100 billion today and another 100 billion tomorrow , &quot; he said . 
dealers said comments by a key Finance Ministry official that market participants being overly pessimistic about the outlook for the Japanese economy also weighed on the market . 
Eisuke Sakakibara , director-general of the International Finance Bureau , said recent economic indicators in Japan had been rather strong and said the market was taken up by &quot; irrational negative exuberance &quot; . 
Eurodollar futures ended flat as players awaited the release of the U.S. Producer Price Index and retail sales data for March on Friday . 
September Eurodollars ended unchanged at 93.725 against their IMM close on light volume of 3,015 lots .
