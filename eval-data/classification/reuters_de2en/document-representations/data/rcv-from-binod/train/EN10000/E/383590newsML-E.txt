Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin on Tuesday issued the following economic forecasts in the 1997 / 98 budget , for the calendar years : 
10-yr govt bond rate ( avg PCT ) 7.2 7.1 7.1 
91-day Treasury bill ( avg PCT ) 4.2 4.0 4.5 
the 1996 numbers are actual except for GDP figures , which are estimates . 
the government tries to work from a position of prudence in making forecasts . 
as in Martin &apos;s budget update in October , the assumptions for short-term and long-term interest rates are higher than the average private sector projection by 80 basis points for short-term rates and 50 basis points for long-term for both 1997 and 1998 . 
in last year &apos;s March budget , Martin had used a full 80 basis points for both long and short term for 1997 to account for a possible resurgence in the Quebec separatist movement . 
this year &apos;s budget did not mention the Quebec factor in its discussion of the assumptions . 
but it spoke of the risk of a stronger than expected increase in U.S. rates , possibly spilling over into Canada . 
it said the smaller prudence factor applied to long-term rates reflected the unusual steepness of the Canadian yield curve . 
since long-term rates are already unusually high , compared to short-term rates , they may not rise commensurately with any future increase in short rates . 
these prudence factors result in a level of nominal gross domestic product ( GDP ) that is 0.2 percent lower in 1997 than forecast by the private sector and 0.7 percent lower in 1998 . 
last year &apos;s budget had assumed long-term rates of 8.2 percent and short-term of 6.6 percent . 
the 3.2 percent assumption for real growth in GDP in 1997 was up from 2.6 percent assumed last March and 3.0 percent assumed in October . 
the Bank of Canada is projecting four percent real growth in GDP . 
the budget did not give assumptions for unemployment , employment growth or inflation . 
but it said economists were now forecasting unemployment to fall to 9.3 percent on average for 1997 and 8.8 percent for 1998 , employment growth of 2.0 percent in each year , and consumer price index increases of 1.6 percent in 1997 and 1.8 percent in 1998 .
