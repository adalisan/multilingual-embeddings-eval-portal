the grain and Feed Trade Association has decided that it needs to improve contacts and representation with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation , according to GAFTA president David Small . 
&quot; We have now applied for recognition and representation on FAO as a non-governmental organisation , and await confirmation , &quot; Small said in a speech prepared for delivery at the GAFTA annual dinner on Thursday . 
&quot; Clearly governments wish to get closer to the international private sector and GAFTA is the only truly international trade association in grain and feed , &quot; Small said . 
&quot; With more government disputes being referred to the WTO arbitration panels , we believe we have a significant role to play in representing the non-governmental international trade , &quot; Small said . 
&quot; It is possible that we could be of great assistance in matters of international arbitration , &quot; he said .
