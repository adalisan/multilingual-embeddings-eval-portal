Taiwan , which recently severed unofficial ties with Cambodia , plans to shut down several &quot; ineffective &quot; overseas representative offices , its state-funded news agency reported on Monday . 
the Central News Agency quoted Foreign Minister John Chang as saying the ministry would close three to four unofficial offices abroad , including in Libya , as early as this week . 
&quot; There is no need for these unofficial outposts to continue their operations because they are ineffective in promoting ties , &quot; Chang was quoted as saying . 
Chang did not name the other offices slated for closure . 
the move came one week after Taipei recalled its representatives from Phnom Penh and ordered closure of Cambodia &apos;s Taipei office . 
Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen on July 22 ordered the closing of Taiwan &apos;s office , alleging that illicit Taiwanese aid was provided to the royalist forces of Co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh during fighting in early July . 
Taipei has denied complicity in Cambodia &apos;s turmoil and laid the blame for the row squarely with communist China , saying Beijing was widening its diplomatic embargo of Taiwan to non-official spheres . 
Beijing , rival of Taipei since a civil war split them in 1949 , considers Taiwan a renegade province not entitled to foreign relations . 
Chang said Taipei would not consider returning to Cambodia unless Phnom Penh acknowledged its mistake . 
&quot; We will only consider reopening Cambodia office unless Cambodia apologises , &quot; Chang told reporters . 
Taiwan has diplomatic ties with only 30 countries -- mostly poor states dependent on the wealthy island for economic help . 
it maintains unofficial relations with most other countries , including vibrant trade links with economic powers like the United States , Japan and even mainland China .
