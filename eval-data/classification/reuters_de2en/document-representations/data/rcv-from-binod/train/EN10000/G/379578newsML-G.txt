in Miami &apos;s poor black district of Liberty City , drug gangs infest the streets , violence is frequent and children are often the victims . 
with police helicopters flying overhead and barricades at road junctions , the rundown , rubbish-strewn streets look at times like a war zone -- more like Soweto in apartheid days than chic , wealthy coconut Grove a few kilometres away . 
the death last month of 5-year-old Rickia Issac , hit by a stray bullet as she walked home from a Martin Luther King Day Parade , touched many people and forced the attention of city and police officials on the blighted area . 
but police and community leaders hold out little hope the violence and crime will ease in one of the most dangerous parts of one of the toughest cities in the United States . 
&quot; This ( area ) is a flea market for drugs , &quot; the Rev. 
Douglas Cook said , sitting in a Pew in Jordan Grove Missionary Baptist Church . 
&quot; Drugs have gotten so heavy people don &apos;t have their heads on right . 
people just start shooting from anywhere . 
more than 2,000 people packed his church last weekend for Rickia &apos;s funeral . 
a few days earlier a service was held there for two of five men whose bodies were found bound and gagged , shot execution-style , in an apartment that police said was used as a marijuana-packing plant . 
Community leaders announced a gun buy-back programme , but only about a dozen weapons were handed in and by the end of the week it was business as usual . 
as night fell on Friday , police set up a roadblock on the border of Liberty City and the immigrant Little Haiti district to check vehicles for guns , drugs and drunk drivers . 
&quot; What you have is a turf war between the Haitians and the African Americans , &quot; police officer Robert McLish told a reporter who rode with him on a night-time patrol . 
&quot; If there &apos;s a drive-by killing on one side of the highway there &apos;s usually one a week or so later on the other side in retaliation . 
McLish , 27 , who was born in Jamaica and has been a policeman for two years , carried a Glock 22 pistol and wore a bullet-proof vest under his shirt . 
the gangs have &quot; just about everything &quot; in guns , including AK-47s and Uzis , he said . 
as he drove through streets of small , squat houses and barracks-like apartment blocks , groups of men loitering outside bars and liquor stores glared at the car . 
there seemed to be either a church or a bar at every corner . 
outside one church a sign read : &quot; If not now , when ? 
for the love of our children increase the peace . 
&quot; Murals painted on crumbling walls depict black icons such as Martin Luther King , Nelson Mandela and Malcolm X. 
many streets have been barricaded by police . 
&quot; There &apos;s one way in and one way out , &quot; McLish said . 
during his shift he checked out arguments among neighbours , tenants and landords and complaints of domestic violence . 
two teenage girls threatened to rally their friends against each other in a fight over a boy who gave one of them 15 cents . 
their mothers feared a repetition of an incident last week when a schoolgirl shot another in the face . 
&quot; Somebody &apos;s gonna end up dead for nothing , &quot; McLish told them as he calmed the situation . 
later a young boy ran up to the patrol car to say his big brother had just beaten up his sister . 
to the officer &apos;s relief there was no heavy gunplay that night , but a policeman died when he crashed his car after swerving to avoid a beggar in a wheelchair . 
McLish was sympathetic to the people of Liberty City , where jobs are scarce , many adults are on welfare and single women struggle to bring up large families with absent fathers . 
&quot; Within this community you have a lot of decent people too , &quot; he said . 
Cook echoed the litany of woes : &quot; Kids don &apos;t listen to parents , police or preachers . 
the jail is packed . 
they &apos;re all young people and their life is already destroyed . 
Cook , who was born 69 years ago in savannah , Georgia , said drug-dealing provided fast and easy money . 
&quot; Sometimes I sit and look out of the window of my office and can see them selling drugs , &quot; he said . 
&quot; They leave them in an old shoe or a can , then they tell the man -- you go pick up that shoe . 
&quot; They have the children out there watching if the officers come . 
they yell &apos; fire &apos; to warn them . 
parents go to work and the kids slip back from school and do what they want . 
blacks see themselves at the bottom of Miami &apos;s social heap and are frustrated and angry , he said . 
in 1980 , one of the worst recent U.S. race riots erupted in Liberty City and spread through Miami after an all-white jury acquitted white police officers accused of killing a black man . 
civic leaders are mindful that last October riots broke out in St. Petersburg , 320 miles ( 515 km ) northwest of Miami , after a police shooting incident in a deprived black area . 
racial resentment also seethes against Miami &apos;s huge Cuban population . 
blacks feel the waves of immigrants robbed them of work by taking lowly jobs for less than the minimum wage . 
in November , blacks lost their sole voice on the city commission when Miller Dawkins was fired over a corruption scandal , and a Cuban American won the seat . 
Cook said Liberty City &apos;s despair was compounded by the fact that it was fellow blacks who killed Rickia Issac and who were selling drugs on the streets . 
&quot; It &apos;s just sad the way it &apos;s happening , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We have let Satan come into our hearts and minds .
