figures in brackets compare against previous day &apos;s close 
-------------------------- ( April 7 ) ----------------------------- 
* New Zealand debt market rallies across the curve 
* Currency buoys short end , bonds encouraged by Australia 
new Zealand bank bill futures rallied 10 basis points on Monday and the buoyant mood fed through to the long end of the curve where yields closed six points lower . 
dealers cited a number of factors for the market strength including overselling late last week , a short market , strength in the Trade-Weighted Index , relief at Friday &apos;s U.S. jobs data and comments by Winston Peters about the New Zealand dollar . 
a strong performance from Australian bonds added to the local bid tone , particularly the long bonds . 
&quot; There were some big orders hit the bond market last week but they seem to have been digested now , and there is a bit of a bid in the &apos; 20s in the long bonds , &quot; one dealer said . 
the Bankers Trust Monetary Policy Index rose a couple of points to 131 , about the level it was at when the Reserve Bank said in March it wanted conditions to ease . 
however , dealers doubt the RB will tell the market to ease ahead of the April 15 release of critical March quarter inflation data . 
the U.S. dollar is seen knocking against strong resistance at 125 yen but any push through that level could give the TWI fresh impetus and see the local bills rally on , dealers said . 
but they said the New Zealand dollar was looking weak in the face of U.S. dollar strength despite receiving a Filip from Treasurer Winston Peters who told Reuters Financial Television in the Philippines that it was likely to rise further over the long-term . 
new Zealand bond spreads against U.S. and Canadian bonds came in markedly from Friday &apos;s levels .
