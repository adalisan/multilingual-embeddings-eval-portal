the only portrait Eva Peron was ever known to have sat for has drawn the interest of every auction house and collector in the world , a spokeswoman of a small Florida museum which has the painting on display said on Wednesday . 
&quot; Interest has been phenomenal ... 
I &apos;m getting calls every 10 to 15 minutes wanting to know information , &quot; said Cathy Lea , communications manager at the Museum of Arts and Sciences in this eastern Florida city . 
she said since Tuesday when the museum displayed the oil-on-canvas portrait of Peron by the Brazilian artist Candido Portinari , &quot; There &apos;s been an interest by every auction house and collector and everything , it seems like , in the world . 
Lea said attendance at the museum has also jumped . 
about 200 people viewed the portrait on Tuesday and another 100 came on Wednesday , about 30 percent higher than the museum &apos;s normal attendance . 
interest in the portrait has been sparked by the film &quot; Evita , &quot; based on Andrew Lloyd Webber &apos;s musical of the same name , which stars Madonna as Eva Duarte de Peron , the celebrated first lady of Argentina during the populist government of Juan Peron . 
Lea said the museum had no plans of selling the painting , done in 1940 when Peron was a 21-year-old radio star .
