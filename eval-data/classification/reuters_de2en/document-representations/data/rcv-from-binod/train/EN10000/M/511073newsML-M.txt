CME live cattle futures were expected to open steady to 0.100 cent higher while feeder cattle calls ranged from 0.100 cent higher to 0.100 cent lower , analysts said . 
further strength in live cattle futures is expected to stem from still-firm cash markets . 
boxed beef values continued to rise and were at 2-1 / 2-week highs , and fed cattle could trade at higher values at any time , they said . 
but futures appear a little overbought and beef prices may be nearing a top which would limit gains , they added . 
heavy-weight choice boxed beef rose $ 1.06 per cwt Monday to $ 102.84 , their highest since March 27 . 
for feeders , a lower index and calls for easier CBOT corn futures may offset each other , analysts said . 
reports of heavy cattle and calf death loss in the northern plains from last week &apos;s blizzard remained a supporting factor , they added . 
the latest CME feeder cattle index was off $ 0.49 at $ 70.48 per cwt .
