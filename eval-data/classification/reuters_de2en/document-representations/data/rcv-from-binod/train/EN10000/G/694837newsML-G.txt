defence Minister Igor Sergeyev on Sunday described an appeal by a respected general to oppose the planned military reform as a &quot; call to revolution &quot; , but a top Kremlin aide dismissed the idea of widespread unrest among the Russian military . 
&quot; This is a call to revolution in the most difficult , most critical moment for this nation &apos;s armed forces , &quot; Interfax news agency quoted Sergeyev as saying in reference to General Lev Rokhlin &apos;s open letter to President Boris Yeltsin published on Tuesday . 
Rokhlin , who is also a senior pro-government legislator , said on Tuesday that the military reform would finally ruin the armed forces and appealed to army officers to resist government plans to scale down the military . 
&quot; My conversations with officers before and after Rokhlin &apos;s letter show that most of them back the Defence Minister , &quot; Interfax quoted Yuri Baturin , the secretary of Yeltsin &apos;s Defence Council set up to reform the armed forces , as saying . 
many political commentators have suggested that Rokhlin &apos;s appeal , first of its kind made by a respected general , was an early warning from Russia &apos;s powerful top brass worried by the prospects of dramatic cuts in the army in the course of reforms . 
Russia had no military coups since the early 19th century but some political analysts said the disastrous state of the post-Soviet armed forces leaves them open to provocative agitation . 
Rokhlin denies any political motivation behind his appeal . 
he insists the situation is critical and could lead to mutiny . 
Yeltsin , outraged by the dramatic decline of the huge but largely ineffective military machine , put Sergeyev in charge of the ministry last month , ordering him to start long-delayed military reforms . 
Yeltsin wants the armed forces to be cut to 1.2 million troops from about 1.8 million as part of a long-term strategy to transform the ramshackle , conscript-based forces into a leaner , professional fighting machine . 
Itar-Tass news agency quoted Sergeyev as saying his ministry and other Yeltsin aides were finishing the work on the military reform plan . 
Sergeyev said he hoped to present the document by the deadline of July 25th set by the president . 
&quot; judging by the way the Defence Ministry handles the reform I feel sure it will cope with it , &quot; Baturin , who feuded over the leading role in the military reform with Sergeyev &apos;s predecessor , Igor Rodionov , told TASS . 
&quot; The minister needs and deserves all-round support , &quot; he added . 
on Sunday Sergeyev received backing for his efforts to reform the armed forces and maintain their stability from two unlikely quarters . 
the head of the militant trade union of the armed forces &apos; civilian personnel , which is at odds with the ministry , said Rokhlin &apos;s appeal was unconstitutional while former general Alexander Lebed , a leading opposition figure popular in the armed forces , said Sergeyev was a trustworthy professional . 
&quot; Rokhlin &apos;s concern is understandable but he should have chosen another form of expressing it , &quot; Interfax quoted the union leader Spartak Arzhavin as saying . 
&quot; vociferous appeals to the military can be viewed as an attempt to politicise the army which is unconstitutional . 
Lebed said Sergeyev should be given a chance to reform the armed forces . 
&quot; I resolutely oppose attacks on the defence minister , &quot; Lebed told Interfax . 
&quot; He is a respected general and , after all , even regiment commander should not be criticised too harshly in the first six months of service .
