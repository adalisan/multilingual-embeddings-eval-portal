a European Union award of 77,350 tonnes of free market soft wheat at a minimum tax of 0.02 Ecus per tonne in its main tender values a tonne of French wheat for late September at $ 181.47 per tonne , Reuters calculates . 
this calculation , which should be regarded as an estimate only , has been updated with late prices and official notification of the tax level , earlier reported at 0.02 Ecus . 
it is based on the following assumptions gathered from market sources and Reuters data . 
Rouen-delivered soft wheat ( Sep ) 880.00 francs / tonne 
carrying charge ( 2nd-half Sep ) 14.54 francs / tonne 
fob charges / other charges 27.50 francs / tonne 
tax ( at 6.61023 French green rate ) 0.13 francs / tonne 
spot franc / dollar 5.0815 francs / dollar 
implied fob price in dollars 181.47 dollars / tonne . 
the same formula suggests an untaxed French fob price of $ 181.45 per tonne .
