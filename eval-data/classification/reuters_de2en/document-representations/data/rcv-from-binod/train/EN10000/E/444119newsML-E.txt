generally yields and spreads are seen closing 1997 around current levels , but the market will not be steady in between . 
yields are seen ending the year at 8.00 percent , with the spread to treasuries at 125 points . 
at the midsession on Friday , 10-year bonds were at 7.98 percent , and 128 points over the corresponding U.S. Treasury . 
the same questions were put to economists at the beginning of the year . 
then yields were also seen ending 1997 at 8.00 percent , but the spread was seen being slightly wider at 140 points . 
many felt the current weakness in bonds , and the widening in spreads from around 80 points earlier in the year , to be overdone and said bonds currently represented good value . 
however they said the negative market sentiment could not be ignored , especially as the U.S. market was expected to remain bearish ahead of the U.S. FOMC meeting later this month . 
economists generally saw yields rising and spreads widening into the middle of the year as the U.S. began a tightening cycle and amid signs of improving domestic growth . 
from there two schools of thought emerged . 
one saw yields staying at the higher levels as signs of some local inflation pressures began to raise concerns , while the U.S market would probably be rallying as the expected first half rate hikes began to slow the U.S. economy down . 
the market had already factored in all the positive information on inflation that it was going to , leaving little potential for the spread to narrow much from current levels . 
others saw the local market rallying , and outperforming , treasuries through the second half of the year as local growth did not prove to be as robust as first thought and inflation remained well under control . 
the continued favourable inflation outlook , which would be better than many were expecting , would provide the basis for the spreads to narrow , they said .

dwelling unit COMMENCEMNTS - signs of a pick up in building approvals and housing finance data from the middle of last year should have led to a fairly solid increase in housing starts , although there were a few forecasts loking for another negative quarter . 
if the median forecast is realised , commencements will rise to just above 30,000 to be positive in annual terms . 
however , they will still be below the levels of June and September 1994 when they were over 47,000 a quarter .
