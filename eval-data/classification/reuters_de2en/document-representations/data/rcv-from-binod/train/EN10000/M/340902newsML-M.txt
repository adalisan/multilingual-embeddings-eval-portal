Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s comments on the state of the economy will preoccupy bond market participants Thursday . 
Greenspan testifies before the Senate Finance Committee beginning at 1000 est / 1500 GMT and his remarks will be closely scrutinized for hints on his mindset on inflation before next week &apos;s meeting of the Fed &apos;s policy- making arm . 
the only other data on Thursday are initial jobless claims , the help wanted index and the APICS survey , none of which are expected to draw attention from the chairman &apos;s remarks . 
on Wednesday the Treasury successfully launched its first auction of inflation-indexed bonds , but analysts said it is unlikely it will carry any follow-through implications . 
&quot; Remember , this thing is traded in a world of its own . 
it does not trade in tandem with the rest of the market , &quot; said Anthony Karadakis , senior financial economist at First National Bank of Chicago . 
instead , the market will take its cue from Greenspan , although Karadakis was not sure the Fed chairman would really have anything dramatically different to say than the last time he appeared on Capitol Hill . 
&quot; It &apos;s interesting to note the market &apos;s price action since the beginning of December and now . 
we see some of the classic signs of a bear market setting in , &quot; said Kevin Flanagan , economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc . 
&quot; In recent weeks we &apos;ve had a lot of negative price action as the result of what would normally be seen in the bond market as stronger than expected economic news , &quot; Flanagan said . 
&quot; Housing starts plunge , the ECI is right where the market would have wanted it a month ago and durable goods come in very weak -- and the result is yields move up a tad , &quot; he said . 
now the market seems to ignore what should be considered good economic news for fixed-income securities , he said . 
even if a market friendly initial jobless claims number hits the tape on Thursday morning , it may not have the usual impact . 
Flanagan also did not believe Greenspan would have much to say to excite the market . 
&quot; If we get a 4.0 percent rise in GNP and the market tanks , the Fed &apos;s on notice that maybe its policy directives are lagging what the market already was pricing in . 
it &apos;ll hit them right between the eyes , &quot; Flanagan said . 
Josh stiles , senior bond strategist at I.D.E.A. , expected an innocuous 5,000 dip in claims and 1-tick rise in the Conference Board &apos;s help wanted index would not be market moving Thursday . 
&quot; The main event will be Greenspan and it &apos;s not so much what he says as much as it is what people read between the lines on what he says , &quot; stiles said . 
stiles thought Greenspan was more comfortable with long bond yields in the 6.90 percent range than with them hovering around 6.50 percent , providing unnecessary stimulus . 
however , he added that Greenspan may shortly be running out of patience if he thought GDP was growing too broadly . 
&quot; Inflation is still hard to pinpoint , but clearly he &apos;s concerned its out there by the wayside waiting to make its presence felt , &quot; stiles said . 
late Wednesday , the two-year note was 99-23 / 32 , up 2 / 32 , to yield 6.03 percent . 
the 10-year was up 6 / 32 at 99-5 / 32 to yield 6.62 percent . 
the 30-year bond was up 9 / 32 at 94-29 / 32 to yield 6.90 percent . 
dealers said Federal funds would open between 5-5 / 16 percent and 5-3 / 8 percent Thursday .
