the City of Moscow is planning to issue a Eurobond with a three-year maturity rather than a longer one because the bond is a debut issue , not because of any restrictions from the Central Bank , a spokesman for the city government said on Wednesday . 
&quot; Last summer when we started thinking about our Eurobond we decided it should be short as it is our first , &quot; Mikhail Chernyshov told Reuters . 
Moscow will issue a $ 400 million three-year Eurobond this summer . 
some Western bankers said the Central Bank had restricted regional Eurobond maturities to three years by issuing a foreign exchange licence for only three years . 
a Central Bank official said the bank , the Finance Ministry and the Federal Commission on the Securities Markets were working on a package of regulation for regional Eurobond issues . 
he said the three-year term of the licence may be changed , but gave no more details . 
Russia does not yet have a proper legislation on regional Eurobond issues . 
President Boris Yeltsin had to approve issues by the City of Moscow , St Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod .
