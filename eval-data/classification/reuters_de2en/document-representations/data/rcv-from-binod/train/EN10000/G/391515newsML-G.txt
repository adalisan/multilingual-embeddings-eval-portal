President Bill Clinton on Thursday called &quot; deeply troubling &quot; the alleged corruption of Mexico &apos;s top anti-drug official , who was fired this week , but said he was pleased the government had acted promptly to deal with it . 
&quot; I &apos;m troubled by it , but I &apos;m also encouraged by the strong action that President ( Mexican President Ernesto ) Zedillo has taken , &quot; Clinton said . 
Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo was ousted as head of Mexico &apos;s National Institute for the Combat of Drugs ( INCD ) for alleged links to a powerful narcotics trafficker and charged with drug corruption . 
&quot; It &apos;s a very serious revelation and deeply troubling , &quot; Clinton said when asked about the development at an unrelated White House ceremony . 
he said that in taking action against Gutierrez , the Mexican government was &quot; obviously saying to the world and the people of Mexico , we will not tolerate the corruption if we find it and root it out , even if it &apos;s at the highest level . 
Clinton said the extent of Mexican corruption evident in the charges against Gutierrez would be a &quot; mixed factor &quot; in determining whether Mexico was cooperating in the U.S. effort to fight illicit drug use . 
a finding that it was not cooperating would trigger a cutoff of U.S. aid .
