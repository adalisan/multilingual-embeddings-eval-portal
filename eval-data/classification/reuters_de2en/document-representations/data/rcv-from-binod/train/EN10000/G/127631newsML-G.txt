a tax protester was sentenced to 36 years in prison on Thursday for trying to blow up the U.S. Internal Revenue Service building in Reno . 
Joseph Bailie , 42 , was found guilty in June of three charges in connection with the failed attack on the tax agency last December . 
the 100-pound ( 45 kg ) fertiliser and fuel oil bomb was found in the car park of the IRS building in Reno . 
its three-foot ( one-metre ) long fuse had burned out and it did not explode . 
passing sentence , U.S. District Judge Howard McKibben said Bailie was guilty of &quot; lawless and wanton conduct &quot; with what he called substantial potential for causing serious harm to people and property . 
Bailie , who had been convicted of conspiracy , the attempted destruction of a government building and the use of an explosive device in the commission of a crime , was also ordered to make restitution to the IRS of $ 141,000 . 
the Reno bomb was made of similar materials to the one that blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City last year and killed 168 people .
