IPE oil futures were expected to start the week &apos;s trade unchanged to slightly lower after Friday &apos;s sharp fall when hurricane damage fears in the Gulf of Mexico eased , brokers said on Monday . 
IPE Brent was called steady to five cents lower from the September contract &apos;s $ 18.12 a barrel settle last week , with the momentum of Friday &apos;s 57 cent fall continuing a little . 
IPE gas oil was anticipated opening flat to 50 cents or a $ 1 lower . 
it closed on Friday at $ 163.50 a tonne , down $ 3.50 on the day , and may slide further to catch up with the damage done to Brent and WTI numbers after it stopped trading last week . 
IPE futures lifted and then fell sharply last week as Hurricane Danny loomed off the U.S. Gulf Coast , threatened to badly damage oil installations , and then passed by peacefully . 
&quot; There was also some long liquidation ahead of the U.N. meeting , &quot; said one broker . 
few players wanted to begin Monday &apos;s trade exposed , with the U.N. expected to receive the Iraqi aid distribution plan . 
its approval will clear the way for Baghdad to export crude again under its &quot; oil-for-food &quot; deal with the U.N. 
&quot; We see it as stable with a downward bias after the U.N. meeting , after which it should find some buying again , &quot; said one broker . 
but it was unclear if the U.N. would meet immediately to approve the plan on Monday or if some time would be needed to digest and discuss its details . 
brokers said they would also be watching the North Sea carefully , where problems at the Nelson field have already pushed some 1.25 million barrels from the Forties loading programme for July into August . 
worsening North Sea problems or memories of last week &apos;s bullish draw on U.S. gasoline stocks could help keep IPE Brent above $ 17.84 , the next critical support level , brokers said .
