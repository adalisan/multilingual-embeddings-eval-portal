a man and woman held for questioning over the December murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier , the wife of a French film producer , were released without being charged on Monday night . 
chief superintendent Noel Smith of Bandon police said charges had not been brought against either of the two , who were not named . 
Smith said police files on the case would be sent to Ireland &apos;s Director of Public Prosecution for further examination . 
he gave no further details . 
police sources said the two were arrested in the neigbourhood of Schull , close to the village where the French woman was found dead on December 23 . 
she had been bludgeoned to death in a lane near her West Cork holiday home at Dunmanuf three days after arriving from France to take a brief vacation . 
the 38-year-old woman was married to Daniel Toscan du Plantier , a leading figure in the French film world and a friend of French President Jacques Chirac . 
the pair could have been held for up to 12 hours without being charged under Irish law . 
the man was arrested in the morning and the woman was detained a few hours later , police said . 
the arrests follow one of the biggest international investigations carried out by Irish police , who visited France on several occasions for talks with their French counteparts . 
the killing threw the media spotlight on the West Cork region , home to hundreds of expatriates drawn by its stunning unspoilt beauty and remoteness . 
many have gravitated towards the region of Schull which has spectacular ocean views , a thriving harbour where foreign yachts are moored and few rural houses . 
House prices in the West Cork region have risen by up to 20 percent in the past two years because of growing foreign demand for secluded residences , estage agents say . 
the Du Plantiers had a small house in Dunmanuf village and were occasional visitors in recent years . 
Germans , Belgians , French , Danes and Swedes are among the nationalities who have settled in the region . 
West Cork is principally an agricultural region but its economy has benefitted from huge foreign tourist interest since the mid 1970s , local officials say .
