damage from Hurricane Hortense is unlikely to have a material credit impact on the $ 14.6 billion of bonds issued by Puerto Rico and its agencies , Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s Corp said Monday . 
initial damage reports stood at nearly $ 300 million , but there were no reports of major infrastructure damage . 
President Clinton declared the island a disaster area , so it will be eligible for federal aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency . 
to date , more than half the island , or 41 of 78 municipalities , have been declared eligible for FEMA funds . 
most of the damage was caused by the hurricane &apos;s record heavy rains , over 20 inches in Somme areas , which caused severe flooding . 
the greatest damage , estimated at $ 125 million , was to the island &apos;s agriculture , particularly to the coffee and plantain crops . 
Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority reported damage at $ 36 million , mostly to transmission lines , and lost revenues of $ 8 million due to outages . 
about 85 percent of the residents were without power immediately after the storm but power has been restored to 95 percent of the customers , S &amp; P said . 
Puerto Rico aqueduct and sewer Authority estimated only $ 7.5 milion in damages . 
after the hurricane , 93 percent of customers lacked water , primarily because of the water system &apos;s reliance on electric power . 
the Department of Transportation estimated it will take $ 30 million to replace bridges and rebuild roads damaged by Hortense . 
there was damage to one toll road , PR52 between San Juan and Ponce in the Cayay area . 
traffic was routed to the northbound lanes to keep the highway passible . 
it is estimated that repairs will be completed within two months . 
Puerto Rico telephone Co was basically unaffected . 
the Puerto Rico Tourism Co reported there was no structural damage to any hotels . 
this should not affect the peak tourism season , which does not begin until mid-November . 
September is usually one of the slowest months of the year , so losses should be minimal . 
Puerto Rico Ports Authority reported $ 2.53 million in damages , including $ 820,000 in damage to the aviation area , and $ 1.7 milion in damages to maritime facilities . 
Luiz Munoz Marin Airport , the largest facility on the island , was virtually undamaged and resumed operations soon after the storm .
