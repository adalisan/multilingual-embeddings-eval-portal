grains futures on the Budapest commodity Exchange remained trendless on Thursday on a lack of domestic or international news , traders said . 
&quot; Chicago gave no guidance to wheat prices ... and maize prices will only move significantly around harvesting time , &quot; said Janos Szolyka of swap . 
July milling wheat was the only maturity to show significant price movement , dropping 290 forints per tonne to 22,010 forints , but volume was a modest 39 lots . 
August milling wheat traded 215 lots , moving down 10 forints to 22,300 . 
Szolyka said milling wheat prices were locked in a range of 22,000 to 23,000 . 
&quot; Crop outlooks are very good ... but a psychological barrier would prevent prices plummeting , &quot; he said . 
maize futures prices were unchanged for all positions except December , which rose 100 forints to 20,500 . 
only 10 lots changed hands . 
the only other traded maize maturity was July , but Szolyka said there was actual delivery behind the single 200-lot deal at Wednesday &apos;s settlement price . 
&quot; Most players have already closed their ( speculative ) positions so everybody is waiting for someone else to move , &quot; he said , adding that the spot market and the futures market were looking at each other for a lead . 
&quot; spot market prices , however , are somewhat lower at the moment , so it could be worth selling on the futures market if one can finance it , &quot; Szolyka said . 
total grain futures turnover was a modest 696 lots , or 311.5 million forints , down from Wednesday &apos;s 1,258 lots , or 547.75 million forints . 
( lot size = 20,000 kg $ = 184.70 Hungarian forints )
