a controversial film &quot; The People vs Larry Flynt &quot; about the Hustler magazine publisher pays tribute to press freedom and does not glorify pornography as its critics claim , director Milos Forman said on Saturday . 
speaking after his film made its international premiere at the 45th annual Berlin Film Festival , Forman lashed out at feminist leaders such as Gloria Steinem and others who have denounced the film they say has glamourised pornography . 
&quot; I am surprised that anyone sees pornography glorified in this film , &quot; Forman said at a news conference after his film was warmly applauded by more than 1,000 journalists at a press screening . 
but Forman said that the film , which won two Academy Award nominations in Los Angeles last week , was about freedom of the press and not pornography . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think people will run out into the streets and buy Hustler because of this film , &quot; Forman said . 
his is a rogue , a charming rogue . 
to say this glorifies him would be like saying &apos; Romeo and Juliet &apos; glorifies suicide . 
it is a demagogical question . 
Forman &apos;s film depicts the tumultuous life of Flynt , a dirt-poor grade school drop-out who ran strip clubs in Ohio before launching his successful hard-core porn magazine Hustler in 1973 . 
aside from a few bare-breast scenes , there are no other sexually explicit moments in &quot; The People vs Larry Flynt . 
the film spotlights his legal battles against America &apos;s conservative Christian leader , the Reverend Jerry Falwell , and others opposed to his magazine because of its obscenity . 
Flynt , now 54 , was paralysed from the waist down after an unknown assailant shot him while he was leaving a Courthouse in 1978 . 
after defeating Falwell in the Supreme Court , Flynt said : &quot; If they will protect a scumbag like me , then they &apos;ll protect all of you . 
woody Harrelson , who portrays Flint , won a best actor nomination last week for his convincing performance and Forman was nominated for another best directing Oscar . 
he has already has won Academy Awards for &quot; One flew Over the cuckoo &apos;s nest &quot; and &quot; Amadeus &quot; . 
&quot; Pornography is the price to pay for freedom of the press , &quot; said Forman . 
&quot; Freedom of the press is more important than elections or free markets . 
elections and free markets can be manipulated , as Hitler did . 
but a free press cannot . 
any laws aimed at restricting pornography may seem noble at first glance , Forman said . 
but opening the door to censorship &quot; even just a crack &quot; paves the way for dictators and autocrats who would move forward to undermine democracy . 
&quot; If I didn &apos;t live so long in a country with censorship , I don &apos;t think I would have had the passion to make this movie , &quot; said the Czech-born Forman , who admitted he had never bought Hustler even though he has read it on occasion . 
Courtney Love , a rock-star turned actress , said that feminists were wrong to opposed the film . 
&quot; I am a feminist and I feel that the reactions against the film completely miss the higher point , which is freedom of the press , &quot; she said . 
Forman admitted that he had to accept some restrictions on the film in the United States . 
a provocative marketing poster with Harrelson clad in an American flag and posing as a crucifix in front of a nearly naked woman &apos;s vagina was banned and will only be used outside the United States .
