the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) chided some of its protege countries in central and eastern Europe for backsliding on the road to economic reform . 
but at the start of its annual meeting , the EBRD , set up in 1991 to help former communist states to make the transition to market economies , also assured Western banks that their loans to the region were perfectly safe . 
EBRD first vice-president Ron Freemen acknowledged that the Czech Republic , once the darling of Western investors , had caused some concern by failing to combat financial fraud vigorously enough . 
&quot; Some of this regulation was slow in coming into the Czech Republic , &quot; he told a news conference . 
&quot; dishonest people took advantage of honest people in a financial sense . 
&quot; Clearly there is an opportunity for the Czech Republic to regulate a bit more carefully the financial sector so that people are better protected from fraud and misrepresentation . 
some foreign investors have been frightened away from Prague by a lack of transparency on Czech markets and a perception that insider trading is rife . 
after a weekend of business presentations and seminars , the governors of the EBRD gather on Monday for their annual meeting . 
freeman also singled out Bulgaria , which he said needed to do more to achieve macro-economic stabilisation , and Belarus , Russia &apos;s economically backward western neighbour , which has made minimal reforms since the collapse of the Soviet Union . 
he urged Bulgaria to establish proper regulation for its banks so that the EBRD could put money into them and enable them to make loans to businesses . 
&quot; There are plenty of opportunities there , but you need a macro-economic stabilisation , you need to have banks that function well , &quot; he said . 
Belarus was struggling but the EBRD still believed in its government &apos;s good faith . 
freeman said political conditions in the country , where President Alexander Lukashenko has been accused of wielding near-dictatorial powers , could be a factor in its relations with the EBRD . 
&quot; It &apos;s within the responsibility and the authority of our board of directors to say that a given country -- and I &apos;m not pointing to Belarus in particular -- is not complying with Article 1 of the EBRD &apos;s charter , which requires that they be moving towards a multi-party democracy , &quot; he said . 
this would mean instructing EBRD staff in the country to cease operations . 
&quot; The board has not done that , &quot; freeman said . 
he said the most advanced reform states -- the Czech Republic , Poland , Hungary and Slovakia -- were now much less marginal than other emerging markets and less vulnerable to any global tightening in the availability of credit . 
&quot; The Czech Republic and several of the other countries have better credit ratings than countries that are already members of the European Union or donor countries of the EBRD , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I think the great majority of loans are in very good shape . 
that &apos;s certainly our experience . 
people are taking their borrowing obligations ... very seriously .
