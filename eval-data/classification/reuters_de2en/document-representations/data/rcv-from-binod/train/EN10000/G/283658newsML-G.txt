NATO reported on Thursday at least a dozen houses formerly inhabited by Bosnian Moslems or Serbs were destroyed over the past week in a Croat-held area near Mostar . 
the attacks were clearly aimed at discouraging non-Croat refugees from returning to settlements south of Mostar , human rights workers said . 
five houses once inhabited by Moslems were destroyed in Stolac on Sunday night and another house was torched on Monday , said Major Tony White , spokesman for the NATO-led peace force . 
three houses in nearby Kukavac were also destroyed on Sunday , two homes belonging to Serbs were razed in Stolac over the weekend and explosions had damaged a house in the village of Prebilovci on Monday , White told a news conference . 
the reports coincide with an alarming rise in expulsions of Moslems from Croat-controlled western Mostar over the past three months . 
groups of armed young men have been systematically evicting the remaining Moslems from western Mostar and seizing their flats , according to U.N. relief workers and international police monitors . 
Croat authorities have failed to put a stop to the expulsions despite repeated pleas from Western diplomats . 
the southwest town of Mostar is strictly divided into Croat and Moslem sectors since a 10-month Moslem-Croat war ended in 1994 . 
local nationalist authorities across Bosnia have been blocking attempts to return ethnic minorities to their homes since a peace agreement was signed last year guaranteeing Bosnians the right to move back to their homes .
