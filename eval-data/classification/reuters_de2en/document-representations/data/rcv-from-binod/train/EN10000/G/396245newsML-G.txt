Israel &apos;s opposition Labour party said on Saturday that it was preparing for new elections because a police probe into allegations of government corruption could force the government to step down . 
labour Secretary-General Nissim Zvilli made the remark a day after Israel Television said police cautioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during questioning this week that his answers could be used against him in court . 
the prime minister &apos;s office refused to comment on Friday &apos;s report . 
a legal analyst said under Israeli legal procedure police issue a caution when they believe the person might say something self-incriminating . 
&quot; It seems to me that the latest development in the investigation creates a new situation in which there are very significant chances that the prime minister and his government will not be able to continue in power , &quot; Zvilli told Reuters . 
&quot; For this reason , we are beginning preparations for early elections , &quot; he said . 
police questioned Netanyahu for four hours on Tuesday about his short-lived appointment last month of lawyer Roni Bar-On as Attorney-General . 
Israel Television said in a report broadcast on January 22 that the appointment was part of a deal for a plea bargain in the corruption trial of parliament member Aryeh Deri , a key figure in Netanyahu &apos;s governing coalition . 
the television has produced no direct evidence to back the allegations that have caused a political storm . 
Netanyahu and others named in the report have denied the allegations . 
in its latest report on the scandal , Israel Television said on Friday that Netanyahu told police he could not recall many of the incidents surrounding the appointment , prompting investigators to caution him . 
Israel Radio later said unnamed police sources confirmed Friday &apos;s television report . 
Netanyahu &apos;s spokesman Shai Bazak said : &quot; We won &apos;t relate to any element pertaining to the investigation . 
internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani , of the Third Way party , said if the corruption allegations proved true , his three-member party would no longer support the goverment . 
&quot; I have often said that if charges were filed ... then there is no place for this government and it will indeed have to go home and new elections will be required , &quot; he told Israel Army radio . 
other ministers , including members of Netanyahu &apos;s own Likud party , have made similar pledges . 
according to the television report last month , Deri had demanded Bar-On get the job in exchange for the Shas party &apos;s support for Netanyahu &apos;s accord with the PLO on Israeli troop redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron last month . 
it said Bar-On promised Deri a plea bargain that would have let Deri continue with his political career . 
the cabinet later approved the Hebron deal with Shas &apos;s support . 
Bar-On , a veteran activist in Netanyahu &apos;s Likud party , quit 12 hours after taking office amid allegations by jurists and politicians that he was a legal lightweight appointed only because of his loyalty to the prime minister .
