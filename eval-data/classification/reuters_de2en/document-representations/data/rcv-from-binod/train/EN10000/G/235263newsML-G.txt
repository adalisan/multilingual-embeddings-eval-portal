the U.N. criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia on Wednesday postponed indefinitely the war crimes trial of a Bosnian Croat military commander due to begin early next year . 
the trial of General Tihomir Blaskic , charged with crimes against Moslem civilians in 1992 and 1993 , had been scheduled to start on January 8 but prosecutors asked for a delay until late April to allow them to fully prepare their case . 
the three-judge panel said it would sit in March to try to set a new trial date . 
the prosecution said in a statement that it was &quot; a difficult and complex endeavour &quot; to gather evidence of &quot; numerous criminal acts committed by various military units over a large geographical area &quot; . 
it said its task was further hindered by non-cooperation from local authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina , hampering efforts to trace and interview witnesses . 
nineteen &quot; significant &quot; witnesses in the case had withdrawn after previously agreeing to testify , it added . 
Blaskic &apos;s defence team opposed the request for a delay and demanded he be released from tribunal custody . 
lawyer Anto Nobilo said that , if released , Blaskic would agree to return to The Hague if recalled . 
the prosecution earlier said it had amended its 1995 indictment against Blaskic , adding six new counts relating to alleged crimes against humanity . 
the new 19-count indictment &quot; more appropriately reflects the accused &apos;s alleged conduct &quot; , it said . 
Blaskic surrendered to the tribunal in April under pressure from the Croatian government , which had come under U.S. pressure to hand him over for trial . 
he subsequently pleaded not guilty to charges of crimes allegedly committed against Moslems when he was commander of Bosnian Croat forces in the Lasva Valley region of Bosnia . 
the indictment said the Croats &apos; &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; was so thorough that almost all the area &apos;s Moslem population was killed or driven away . 
Bosnian Croats and Moslems were nominal allies in the war against separatist Bosnian Serb forces which began in 1992 , but a year later Croat forces turned against the Moslems and began to fight for &quot; pure &quot; Croat territory . 
the village of Ahmici , near Vitez , was virtually destroyed by Croats in April 1993 . 
scores of Moslem civilians were killed , including children who appeared to have been burned alive . 
Blaskic was promoted to a senior post in Croatia &apos;s regular army after his indictment by the Hague-based tribunal . 
the tribunal accuses Blaskic of being responsible for the killing and beating of Moslems and of using them as human shields during the Bosnian conflict . 
the tribunal , set up by the U.N. Security Council in May 1993 , has indicted over 70 Serbs , Croats and Moslems for alleged war crimes but has only seven in custody . 
the first trial , of Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic , ended last week with a verdict expected in the spring . 
last Friday , the tribunal handed down its first sentence , a 10-year jail term for a young Croat soldier who confessed to taking part in the Serb massacre of Moslems after the fall of the U.N. &quot; safe area &quot; of Srebrenica .
