Iran has protested to Olympics officials over what it said was the refusal of an American athlete to take part in an Atlanta Paralympics medals ceremony where the Iranian anthem was played , a newspaper reported on Tuesday . 
the daily Resalat said Vice-President Mostafa Hashemi-Taba wrote to International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch saying it was against the Olympic charter for the medal-winning U.S. shot putter not to stand on the podium during the ceremony in which an Iranian athlete received a gold medal . 
&quot; If the Olympics were a place for political demonstrations , it would be the certain right of the Iranian nation to demonstrate against the American government &apos;s numerous military , economic and political aggressive acts , &quot; Hashemi-Taba said . 
&quot; But this is not done due to respect for the Olympic charter and the spirit of the games , &quot; added Hashemi-Taba who also heads Iran &apos;s National Olympic Committee . 
Hashemi-Taba said the incident took place during the medals ceremony for a shot put event won by Iran &apos;s Qader Modabber . 
he did not give the date or name the U.S. athlete . 
the Paralympics Games for disabled athletes started in Atlanta on Friday . 
there was no independent confirmation of the incident .
