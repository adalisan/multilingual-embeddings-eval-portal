European fuel oil bunker prices spiked up on Thursday , drawing buyers deeper into their shells and killing trade , dealers said . 
Rotterdam 380 cst bunkers were as high as $ 123 / $ 124 fob at midsession , but retreated to $ 119 / $ 121 fob towards the close , still a gain of $ 7 in the last two days since the renewal of U.S. / Iraqi tension . 
&quot; We &apos;ve just seen tiny volumes of a few hundred tonnes and the odd bit of diesel , &quot; said one dealer . 
localised tightness of diesel in Antwerp pushed prices to $ 10 above those in Rotterdam . 
the pattern of high prices and lack of buying interest was repeated in most other centres . 
&quot; It &apos;s dead . 
it &apos;s absolutely crazy , &quot; said a Hamburg dealer . 
prices in Italy , south France and Spain remained similar to those in Rotterdam , drawing enquiries but little actual trade . 
dealers said prices were also more competitive in East Asia and the U.S. 
however , further east , notably in Suez and Alexandria and Fujairah , shipowners were more eager to buy , although more covering of essential shorts than mass panic buying .
