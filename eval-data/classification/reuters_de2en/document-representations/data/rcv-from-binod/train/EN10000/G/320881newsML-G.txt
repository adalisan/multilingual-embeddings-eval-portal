former Australian test spinner Bruce Yardley , who has taken over as coach of Sri Lanka , the 1996 world champions in one-day cricket , said on Tuesday the island was brimming with talent . 
&quot; There &apos;s no reason why Sri Lanka should not realise its dream of becoming a powerful test team by 2000 , &quot; he told a news conference . 
&quot; There &apos;s an enormous amount of talent here . 
Sri Lanka , who grabbed world attention when they beat Australia to win the 1996 World Cup , have played just 66 tests since their test debut in 1982 . 
Yardley , who played 33 tests for Australia , has replaced Dav Whatmore , a former Australian test player who quit Sri Lanka to join English county side Lancashire . 
&quot; I love the way Sri Lankans are playing cricket at the moment , &quot; Yardley said . 
&quot; They &apos;ve turned the one-day game upside down . 
Yardley &apos;s first task is to prepare the team for the test tour of New Zealand in February-March .
