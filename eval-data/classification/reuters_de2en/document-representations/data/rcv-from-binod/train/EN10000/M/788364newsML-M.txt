wall Street stocks are expected to slide at the open on Friday , mirroring a sharp fall in bond prices which pointed to a higher interest rate outlook . 
analysts said the Dow industrials could shed anywhere from 50 to 100 points shortly after the open , as the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond lost 18 / 32 to yield 6.57 percent . 
&quot; Long-term rates have risen above 6.50 percent , which has brought jitters to the bond market and should take its toll on the stock market , &quot; Peter Cardillo , director of research at Westfalia Investments , said . 
Cardillo said stocks could fall 70 to 110 points at the open , based on futures . 
in early trade , the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500 futures index sank 10 points to 946.25 . 
Treasury prices , whose slide yesterday sparked profit-taking in the stock market , extended losses amid deteriorated technical conditions . 
&quot; The weakness in the bond market without any real hard news is disquieting , &quot; Arnold Kaufman , editor of Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s Outlook investment advisory news letter , said . 
he said the Dow could drop 50 points after the open . 
in London , the FTSE-100 stock index also tumbled as U.S. Treasury prices fell . 
it was off 71.1 at 5015.7 . 
bond prices started their downturn on Thursday , after the U.S. Treasury released results from its $ 10 billion auction of 30-year bonds , the final leg in its quarterly refunding operation . 
a rise in yields triggered profit-taking in stocks , and the Dow closed down 71 points at 8188 . 
&quot; The stock market cannot continue to go up without a stable bond market , &quot; Cardillo said . 
analysts said the stock market was vulnerable to a pull-back after its robust gains this year . 
they also said markets would watch for any signs of weakness in the recently-strong dollar , which could hurt bonds and stocks .
