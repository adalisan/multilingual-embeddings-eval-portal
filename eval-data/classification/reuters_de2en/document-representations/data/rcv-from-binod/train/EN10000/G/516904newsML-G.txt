the Croatian government said on Thursday parties backed by Croat war refugees won elections in most districts of a Serb enclave due to be reintegrated with the rest of the country . 
the United Nations , which supervised the April 13-14 vote as the transitional authority in Eastern Slavonia , will not release initial results until Friday . 
polling was dogged by technical problems but the results were likely to stand . 
Croatian authorities said they had learned that Croat parties , backed by 58,000 Croats who want to move back after being driven out of the former rebel enclave in fighting six years ago , won at least 15 or 16 of 27 municipalities . 
&quot; More than 80 percent of ( Croat ) refugees voted and Croat parties won in 16 municipalities , maybe in 15 as we don &apos;t have complete figures from one , &quot; Croatian Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Kostovic told a news conference . 
&quot; The HDZ has an absolute majority in most of them , &quot; he said , referring to Croatia &apos;s governing nationalist party led by President Franjo Tudjman . 
&quot; We don &apos;t have individual results , as UNTAES ( U.N. administration ) has not delivered them yet . 
Milan Trbojevic , spokesman for the ethnic Serb party bloc ( SDSS ) , generally agreed with Kostovic &apos;s figures . 
Kostovic said the vote in Eastern Slavonia &apos;s main town , the Danube River port of Vukovar , had split almost evenly between Croatian parties and the SDSS . 
Trbojevic said the SDSS edged Croat parties in votes but fell short of a majority . 
&quot; Latest forecasts show that in Vukovar the Croats will win a razor-thin victory , or maybe the outcome will be even , &quot; he said . 
Kostovic said Croatian parties won overwhelmingly in another main town , Ilok , where Croats were in the majority until 1991 , while the SDSS had a thin lead over Croat parties in Beli Manastir . 
Trbojevic agreed . 
Kostovic said about 64,000 people voted inside the enclave , the vast majority of them Serbs along with a small number of Hungarians and Croats who stayed under separatist rule . 
Eastern Slavonia , seized by Serbs in a 1991 revolt against Croatia &apos;s secession from federal Yugoslavia , will return to central Croatian authority later this year after a transitional period as a U.N. protectorate . 
the elections coincided with voting for municipal and county assemblies throughout the rest of Croatia . 
Tudjman &apos;s party regained control of almost all 21 county assemblies and most town councils but lost to or deadlocked with opposition coalitions in the more liberal big cities , including the capital Zagreb . 
international observers said the elections were administered efficiently overall but voting in Eastern Slavonia was riddled with technical irregularities and opposition parties lacked proper access to the main state-run media . 
technical problems in Eastern Slavonia included last-minute changes of election regulations , inaccuracies in voter lists , late delivery and absence of materials including ballots and ballot boxes and late opening of polling stations . 
almost 200 observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe scrutinised the vote .
