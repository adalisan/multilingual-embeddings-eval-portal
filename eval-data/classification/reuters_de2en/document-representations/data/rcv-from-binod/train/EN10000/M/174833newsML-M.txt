the dollar took a deep dive against the yen on Thursday after a powerful Japanese bureaucrat who played a part in the dollar &apos;s recovery suggested that he is no longer interested in a weaker yen . 
the dollar , after kicking off the Asian session at 113.80 yen , nosedived to 112.20 yen in early Tokyo trading . 
traders said the tumble was triggered by comments from Eisuke Sakakibara , director-general of the Finance Ministry &apos;s International Finance Bureau , which implied that Japan is no longer interested in a further dollar advance . 
Sakakibara told reporters on Thursday that the market view on Japan &apos;s economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than the market thought . 
traders said Japan &apos;s low interest rates , based on a pessimistic outlook for the economy , were a major cause of the dollar &apos;s recent rally and the yen &apos;s depreciation . 
&quot; Sakakibara &apos;s remark , though quite modest , was enough to upset the market , which had generally believed that the Ministry does not mind the dollar &apos;s strong performance , &quot; said a city bank trader . 
the dollar had staged a stunning recovery from last year &apos;s nadir of 79.75 yen to 114.92 by late October . 
the yen &apos;s slide has mirrored the outflow of capital as investors look for higher yields abroad . 
Sakakibara also declined to comment on an article in the Nikkei Financial Daily newspaper on Thursday which quoted him as saying that the dollar &apos;s correction of last year &apos;s sharp slide against the yen was about to finish . 
the paper also quoted him as saying that the ministry was not trying to push the yen down further . 
&quot; We had expected some sort of a denial of the article , but he ( Sakakibara ) disappointed the market , deepening losses in the dollar , &quot; said a trader at a European bank . 
&quot; The MOF apparently started to worry about a further yen slide as this would create the worst-case scenario of import-led inflation in the middle of the weak economy , &quot; said a trader at a U.S. bank . 
however , despite the dollar &apos;s tumble on Thursday , the trend of the weak yen cannot be easily reversed as the yen &apos;s decline is not based on speculative fund flows , traders said . 
the fundamental cause of the weak yen is investors &apos; desire to unload the yen for foreign units , particularly the dollar , which is triggering hefty capital flows out of Japan , they added . 
some traders said they had expected MOF to send such a signal to the market after recent remarks by an influential ex-official at the Finance Ministry . 
on Monday , Toyoo Gyohten , former vice finance minister for international affairs , said in New York that the dollar at 113 yen is probably at the edge of the acceptable range . 
he added that he would prefer to see the U.S. currency below 113 yen . 
&quot; I personally feel ( a yen ) exchange rate above 110 yen would be on the side of being too weak , &quot; Gyohten said . 
traders said it appeared Sakakibara had added his voice to Gyohten &apos;s in an effort to depress the dollar as its bullish tone had become even more accentuated after the U.S. presidential elections . 
Gyohten said that until now , U.S. and Japanese business leaders and monetary authorities had been happy with the dollar &apos;s strength against the yen . 
but he said he was not sure how long that satisfaction might last .
