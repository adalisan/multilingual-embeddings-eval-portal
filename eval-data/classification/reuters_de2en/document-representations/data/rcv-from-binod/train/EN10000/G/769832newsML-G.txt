a cross-party reform commission trying to draw up a new Italian constitution has been deluged with 42,000 amendments to its proposals , parliamentary officials said on Thursday . 
some 30,000 amendments were presented by one hardleft parliamentarian alone , who needed a lorry to carry all her suggestions to the commission offices . 
the commission , headed by Massimo D &apos;Alema , leader of the largest party in the government coalition , the Democratic Party of the Left ( PDS ) , drew up its proposals at the end of June following five months of discussion . 
politicians were given all of July to present their amendments and the cross-party commission is due to meet again in September to study them . 
it is scheduled to finish its work by October 10 , after which a final draft document will go for debate to the upper and lower houses of parliament . 
&quot; We will look to accelerate the work as much as possible , &quot; D &apos;Alema told reporters on Thursday . 
&quot; It seems that a few of the amendments are quite clearly obstructionist , &quot; he added . 
the commission &apos;s recommendations centred on plans for a directly-elected president with powers over defence and foreign affairs , replacing the present largely ceremonial post . 
a prime minister would decide domestic affairs , two new-look assemblies would be elected under a complex voting system and more power would be devolved to the regions . 
besides the huge block of amendments tabled by independent , hardleft parliamentarian , Mara Malavenda , the federalist Northern League party put forward 3,500 changes and the former speaker of the lower house , Irene Pivetti , presented 600 . 
Forza Italia , the leading group in Italy &apos;s centre-right opposition bloc , put forward another 500 . 
the centre-right amendments suggested boosting the power of the elected president , while amendments put forward by parties from the ruling centre-left coalition were aimed at creating a more powerful role for the prime minister . 
the 70-strong commission , which includes most party leaders , hopes that its work will help end the succession of weak revolving-door governments which have run Italy since World War Two . 
any constitutional changes will have to be approved twice by both houses of parliament before being put to a referendum . 
the whole process is expected to last more than a year .
