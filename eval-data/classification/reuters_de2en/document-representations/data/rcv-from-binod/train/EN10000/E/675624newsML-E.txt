Africa , neglected for decades , could be on the verge of an investment boom as economic reforms take root and business wakes up to the continent &apos;s vast untapped mineral and energy wealth . 
U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for African Affairs , Regina Brown , told delegates at sub-Saharan Oil and Minerals conference in Mauritius this week that the world &apos;s perception of Africa was changing . 
&quot; This is a particularly exciting time to be working in Africa ... Business opportunities in Africa abound and could grow , &quot; she said . 
the economies of sub-Saharan Africa grew on average by 4.4 percent last year -- the highest growth in 20 years -- as many governments from the Cape to Cairo embraced broadly market-orientated economic policies . 
but Brown stressed that African countries had to compete aggressively for investment and political leaders needed to continue with economic structural reform programmes . 
Africa &apos;s true mining and energy potential was now only being discovered and could be the catalyst for further real growth in the future , according to many of the hundreds of delegates to the conference . 
&quot; The continent may indeed be on the verge of a growth spurt , &quot; said Stephen Wyman , vice president at Mobil Corp for new exploration and producing ventures . 
Wyman said one of the region &apos;s biggest strengths was clearly its rich natural resources . 
&quot; It has been estimated that Africa holds 100 billion barrels of undiscovered recoverable oil or its equivalent in gas , two-thirds of it in the sub-Saharan region . 
several African mining ministers said vast tracts of the continent had been unexplored and could yield major mineral discoveries . 
&quot; It is in the geopolitical interest of all of us to strive to bring to an end the status of Africa as the dark continent , &quot; said South Africa &apos;s deputy minister of Minerals and Energy , Susan Shabangu . 
delegates said the country with the most potential was the Democratic Republic of Congo -- now free of dictatorial rule after 32 years . 
Florent Mututulo , the new Congo &apos;s mines minister , said at the conference that his country needed massive foreign investment to develop its untapped mineral , oil and hyro-electric power potential . 
for many years the country &apos;s mining industry had been restricted to Shaba province , now Katanga , something Mututulo described as a &quot; scandal &quot; . 
the true potential spread much further . 
&quot; The soil of my country is extremely rich and we can no longer limit this geological scandal to only the province of Katanga . 
we can now unequivocally state that it extends to nearly all other provinces of my country . 
however , delegates and government officials agreed that much had still to be done to allay investor fears of instability and political chaos . 
&quot; attracting and sustaining private investment in the mining sector of the sub-Saharan region requires a major effort by Africa governments to overcome the negative perceptions of Africa that have dominated the minds of the international mining community , &quot; said Malawi &apos;s Energy and Mining Minister Dumbo Lemani .
