Sir Paul McCartney , whose wife Linda has been battling breast cancer , said on Friday he writes songs as a form of therapy to stop him &quot; going round the bend &quot; . 
&quot; Music has always been a consolation for me , &quot; the former Beatle told the Times newspaper in an interview to mark the release of his new solo album , Flamingo Pie . 
&quot; If you asked a lot of songwriters , you &apos;d find that what happens is that they have a bad day so they skulk off to hide from everyone . 
instead of lying on a psychiatrist &apos;s couch they talk to themselves in song , &quot; said the recently knighted Beatle . 
McCartney said : &quot; Linda has not been well the past year or so although she is doing very well now . 
it &apos;s very difficult when you get that kind of situation in your life . 
the album is tinged with melancholy . 
the song &quot; Little willow &quot; was written the day he heard Maureen Starkey , Ringo Starr &apos;s first wife , had died of cancer . 
&quot; It is certainly heartfelt , &quot; McCartney said .
