Malaysia and Thailand are said to have bought up to 80,000 tonnes of Chinese and Argentine corn in the past two weeks . 
Indonesia may also be looking to pick up more corn from China , traders said on Wednesday . 
a major flour mill in Thailand was reported to have purchased 50,000 tonnes of corn from Argentina for March shipment , dealers said . 
the Malaysians were estimated to have bought some 30,000 tonnes of Chinese corn . 
&quot; There were several buyers , but nobody was buying big , &quot; a Singapore trader who monitors the Malaysian market said . 
&quot; It was all for around 10 or 20 tonnes each , more for shortcovering . 
&quot; There was no panic buying ... most of the orders have been locked for April / May , &quot; the purchasing manager for a flour mill in Kuala Lumpur added . 
one Singapore dealer estimated the amount of corn bought by Malaysia from China to range between 20,000 to 30,000 tonnes . 
in Thailand , the flour mill involved in buying corn from Argentina apparently believes the government has finalised its zero-tariff scheme for corn imports . 
&quot; The buyer might expect that the government will have already come up with details on zero-tariff corn imports by the time the shipments arrive in May or June , &quot; one Thai trader said . 
corn prices in Thailand and Indonesia have recently firmed on brisk demand , while easing slightly in Malaysia . 
Indonesian dealers said corn was quoted at 410-415 rupiah a kg in Jakarta , against 400-410 rupiah a kg last week . 
&quot; Local corn prices have been considerably up as demand from feedmills has also risen , &quot; one trader in Jakarta said . 
&quot; Indonesia has bought 100,000 tonnes of Chinese corn and buyers are looking for more , &quot; another dealer said . 
the trader said the buying spree seemed to indicate that people in Indonesia were not very optimistic about the prospects for local corn production . 
&quot; Everybody is buying , but there is no reason for the people to buy unless they know for sure there &apos;s not much local corn available , &quot; he said . 
other traders believe the feedmills are engaged in some purchases merely to take some positions in the market , adding that local stocks were sufficient . 
in Thailand , the domestic corn price edged up this week to 4.40 baht a kg from 4.25 baht last week because of improved demand , trade sources said . 
the price of bulk corn , ex-factory / godown in Malaysia &apos;s central region , was at between 400-415 ringgit a tonne , compared to 420-430 ringgit a week ago . 
traders attributed the lower Malaysian prices to the assurance of stable supply from China . 
&quot; The Chicago Board &apos;s corn prices may have jumped but the Chinese have maintained their price , probably due to their sufficent supply , &quot; said a Malaysian-based trader . 
in the soymeal market , Thailand is seen engaging in some modest buying for May shipment , dealers said . 
&quot; The total buying since last week could be around a cargo or so . 
those who bought seemed to believe that the price could edge up further , &quot; a U.S. commodity house trader said . 
&quot; But those who remained sidelined think prices are still too expensive and should come down further . 
with local output coming to the market soon , I guess they think they can afford to wait , &quot; he added . 
Thai soymeal was quoted slightly higher at 9.65 baht a kg from 9.60 baht last week . 
Indonesian dealers , on the other hand , said soymeal prices were higher on steady demand . 
soymeal was quoted at 830 rupiah a kg , against 810-820 last week . 
in Malaysia , soymeal prices were seen at 850 ringgit a tonne for the local material and 845 ringgit for imported soymeal against 890 and 870 ringgit , respectively , last week . 
grade &quot; A &quot; wheat in bags , ex-factory / godown in the central region , was 100 ringgit higher at 850 ringgit a tonne . 
the local wheat was 50 ringgit higher at 500 ringgit a tonne .
