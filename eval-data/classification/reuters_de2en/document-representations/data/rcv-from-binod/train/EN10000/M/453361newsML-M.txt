U.S. Plains feedlot cattle near midday Wednesday sold steady at $ 67.00 per cwt in light volume , feedlot sources said . 
about 2,000 slaughter steers and heifers that will likely grade select and choice sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area . 
no sales were reported in Kansas , sources there said . 
however , bids at $ 67.00 were passed by some owners still pricing cattle at $ 68.00 to $ 69.00 , sources said . 
the bulk of last week &apos;s sales were at $ 67.00 , although there were a few at $ 68.00 earlier in the week . 
several feedlot managers said owners still expect the bulk of cattle to trade at $ 68.00 amid outlooks for continued strength in beef prices and ideas that packers were short of cattle for this week &apos;s slaughter , they said . 
midday beef prices were quoted up $ 0.47 to $ 0.69 per cwt , on 112 fabricated loads sold , USDA reported . 
heavyweight choice beef was quoted up $ 0.47 at $ 103.86 per cwt , which reflected an advance of $ 2.07 since prices started rebounding on Friday , USDA statistics showed .
