Australian weather forecasters said on Tuesday they were lifting cyclone warnings along the coast of Queensland state . 
forecaster Sue Dargie at the Australian Bureau of meteorology said tropical cyclone Justin remained stationary about 620 kms off the resort town of Cairns and was beginning to decline in power as the sea beneath it cooled . 
&quot; It certainly has weakened this morning , &quot; Dargie told Reuters . 
Dargie said cyclone Justin was now at the lower end of category two generating winds of around 120 kph at its centre . 
&quot; We &apos;re not expecting it to move too much in the next couple of days and conditions are not expected to change too much , &quot; Dargie said . 
&quot; The evidence of it moving towards the coast is much weaker than in previous days ... That &apos;s why we &apos;ve removed ( cyclone ) warnings along coastal areas . 
she said cyclone watches would continue . 
warnings had been in place from Cardwell , north of Townsville , to Yeppoon , near Rockhampton , to the south . 
Dargie said that tropical cyclones derived energy from the warmth of the ocean beneath them , but the sea beneath Justin had begun to cool as the turbulence bought cool waters up from the depths . 
the cyclone had already interrupted coal exports from North Queensland bulk coal ports and appeared to pose a threat to sugar cane growers as well .
