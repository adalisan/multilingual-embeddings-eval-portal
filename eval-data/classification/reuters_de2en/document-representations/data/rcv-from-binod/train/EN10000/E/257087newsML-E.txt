new York City on Friday said that it received about $ 112 million of retail orders for the $ 626 million of bonds due to sold on Tuesday , as a competing bond sale earlier in the week cut the market &apos;s appetite . 
a New York City official , who declined to be named , said that the city closed the first two maturities , 2098 and 2099 . 
he did not anticipate changing the price scale . 
on Wednesday , the Municipal Assistance Corp for New York City sold $ 677 million of bonds , which damped interest in the city &apos;s own bond sale , the official said . 
he added he did not expect to have to reprice New York City &apos;s latest offering . 
&quot; The market was basically flat so there will be no pricing unless it does something dramatic .
