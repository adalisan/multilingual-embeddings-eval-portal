a key economic forecasting gauge edged up 0.1 percent in December , a business research group said Tuesday , signaling moderate growth for the economy in 1997 . 
the Conference Board said the rise in its index of leading indicators -- designed to forecast economic activity six to nine months ahead -- followed a revised 0.2 percent gain in November . 
the November increase previously was reported as 0.1 percent . 
the index was unchanged in October . 
six of the 10 components that make up the index rose in December , led by gains in the nation &apos;s money supply and the length of the factory workweek . 
the leading negative components were higher weekly claims for state unemployment insurance and lower factory orders for consumer goods . 
over the six months from June to December of 1996 , the index rose 0.5 percent . 
the report comes as Federal Reserve policy-makers sit down to discuss whether or not to change short-term interest rates . 
most analysts expect the central bank will stand pat amid signs the economy is moderating from its robust fourth-quarter pace and that inflation remains in check .
