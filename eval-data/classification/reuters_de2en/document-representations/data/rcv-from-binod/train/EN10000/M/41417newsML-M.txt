about 1,000 head sold in the Texas Panhandle / western Oklahoma area . 
no sales were reported in Kansas . 
overall , packer bids Monday were light at $ 70.00 , with cattle sellers generally asking $ 72.00 to $ 73.00 . 
Feedlot cattle prices later in the week were seen steady to $ 1.00 higher amid a continued firm tone to beef prices and an ongoing decline in finished cattle numbers at feedlots . 
Showlists were expected to be down from last week which could leave packers competing for market-ready cattle . 
sales Friday were brisk and culminated a week of standoffs between packers and feedlots . 
Friday is normally a quiet day , with sales usually taking place on Wednesday or Thursday . 
several loads of cattle sold Friday were delivered Monday , illustrating how short on supplies some packers had become while facing off with feedlots , market sources said .
