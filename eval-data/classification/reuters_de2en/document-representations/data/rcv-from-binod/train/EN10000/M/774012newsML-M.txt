North Sea cash Brent crude showed signs of firming in early Friday talk underpinned by thin prompt supply , traders said . 
&quot; Brent should stay strong for a little while because there aren &apos;t too many cargoes around , &quot; said a trader . 
cash Brent intermonth spreads held late Thursday &apos;s levels of + 25 / + 30 cents for Aug / Sep and -4 / -2 cents for Sep / Oct despite a 19-cent drop in IPE September Brent futures to $ 18.75 a barrel . 
but prompt CFDs were firmer bid , Aug 4-8 talked at Sept + 12 / + 16 cents , up about four cents and Aug 11-15 traded at Sept + 1 cent , also a couple of cents firmer . 
only three Brent cargoes were expected to be nominated loading dates in the Aug 16-20 period on Friday and traders said there was only one other cargo , an Aug 13-15 loader , offered on the dated market . 
talk on other North Sea grades were thin early on Friday but most appeared to be holding their differentials to dated Brent . 
&quot; It &apos;s just ticking over quietly at the moment , &quot; said a trader . 
a three-day delay to the August Statfjord programme was taking some of the pressure off late month cargoes . 
Norwegian Oseberg was also looking perkier after four cargoes found homes on Thursday . 
two third-decade Forties cargoes also changed hands on Thursday , leaving few barrels unsold in August , but the details were kept private . 
Ekofisk , on the other hand , was still amply supplied , traders said .
