Philippine interbank call loan rates rose to an average of 10.0625 percent from 10.03125 due to the covering of weekend positions , traders said . 
fears that the Central Bank may again close its overnight borrowing facility prompted lenders in the market to immediately square their positions with the Central Bank . 
that left other banks , who had to cover their weekend positions , to borrow at higher rates , they said . 
the Central Bank did not close its overnight borrowing facility on Monday after successively doing this last Thursday and Friday . 
rates moved in a wider band from 11.0 to 10.0 percent . 
the market had 35 lenders and 22 borrowers . 
in the secondary market , there was little activity since domestic interest rates are thought to have reached their bottom , traders said . 
banks , however , expected a slight 0.5 percentage-point drop in Treasury bill rates at the auction later in the day . 
some 5.0 billion pesos worth of maturing floating rate T-notes are seen nudging rates lower , traders said . 
a Reuter poll of six financial institutions gave bid rates of 9.74 to 9.85 percent on the three-month bills .
