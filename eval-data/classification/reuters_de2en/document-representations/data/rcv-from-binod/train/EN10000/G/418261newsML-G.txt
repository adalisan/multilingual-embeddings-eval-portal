France &apos;s Supreme Court rejected on Tuesday a bid to stop an investigation into alleged widespread illegal phone-tapping by the late Socialist President Francois Mitterrand &apos;s anti-terrorist unit . 
lawyers for several former senior officials under judicial investigation in connection with the bugging , which took place between 1983 and 1986 , had asked the court to declare the case was covered by the statute of limitations and the probe should be closed . 
the court ruled the statute of limitations only applied from the moment the offence was discovered , not the date when it was committed . 
the rule echoes that governing abuse of company funds , on which a wave of leading industrialists are being investigated . 
two former senior government officials , the former head and three members of the since disbanded presidential anti-terrorist unit are being investigated over accusations that the unit tapped the phones of dozens of politicians , writers , lawyers and journalists without the required judicial permission . 
among those whose phones were tapped was actress Carole bouquet , said to be amorously pursued by a senior presidential aide jealous of her other admirers . 
the Supreme Court also ruled that the offence of keeping a recording of a telephone tap or a written account had ended only in January 1995 when an unidentified woman handed five computer discs about the recordings to a guard at the law courts . 
the Paris appeals court last September gave investigating magistrate Jean-Paul Vallat the green light to continue the probe into alleged invasion of privacy . 
among those under investigation are Mitterrand &apos;s former chief aide Gilles Menage , Renault SA chairman Louis Schweitzer , who was chief aide to prime minister Laurent Fabius at the time and prefect Christian Prouteau , who headed the anti-terrorist cell . 
DST counter-espionage officers and two investigating magistrates gave the probe a fillip last month , discovering the cell &apos;s files in a garage rented by Prouteau . 
the archives also included recordings linked to the investigation . 
Prouteau said he had held on to them after the cell was disbanded to prevent them being stolen . 
according to an official watchdog , about 100,000 French telephone lines are illegally tapped each year and state agencies may be behind much of the eavesdropping . 
only 15,000 taps are legally authorised each year . 
legal wiretaps can only be approved by magistrates in criminal cases or to protect national security , prevent terrorist threats or safeguard essential scientific or economic information .
