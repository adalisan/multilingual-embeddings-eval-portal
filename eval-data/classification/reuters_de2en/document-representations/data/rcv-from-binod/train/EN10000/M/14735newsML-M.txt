the Irish equity market drifted off in thin trade caused by the closure of the UK because of a national holiday , dealers said . 
&quot; It &apos;s almost like a day off . 
we &apos;re getting on with our paperwork , &quot; one equity dealer said . 
dealers said London &apos;s closure meant it had yet to react to a fall in Wall Street on Friday and weakness in the Dow on Monday afternoon , where it was off 22 points by 1530 GMT . 
&quot; There &apos;s still a day &apos;s catch-up to do so we &apos;ll see how London performs when it opens tomorrow , &quot; another dealer said . 
dealers said the frontline AIB and Boi stocks were both off a penny but said the movement was exaggerated by the thinness of the market . 
Jurys Hotels was quoted at 280 pence from close of 277 on Friday after its annual general meeting on Monday at which CEO Peter Malone was upbeat about 1996 prospects . 
he said Jurys had gained from its exposure to the strong Irish economy through its corporate and commercial business , tourism , event-related activity and weekend business breaks . 
&quot; It looks good at that price and could move some more upwards then the market proper returns , &quot; a dealer said .
