the index has now risen 42.8 percent ( corrects ) since the beginning of the year . 
traders said today &apos;s gains were fed by continued demand for drug maker Lek &apos;s A issue . 
future market direction hinges on whether foreign investors , the driving force behind the tiny Alpine republic &apos;s bull run , continue to snap up stock or decide to cash in profits , traders said . 
&quot; The upward trend will continue as long as foreigners are prepared to continue buying shares of Lek .... but when they stop buying , the index could tumble 30 to 50 percent , &quot; Goran Brankovic , a trader at Nova Ljubljanska Banka said .
