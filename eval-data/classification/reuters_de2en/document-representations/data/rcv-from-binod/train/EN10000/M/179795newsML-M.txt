a government inquiry into the forward foreign exchange market will not affect provision of short-term cover of up to 12 months , Reserve Bank general managing of international banking Bertus van Zyl said on Monday . 
van Zyl , who heads a committee of central bank and finance department officials appointed by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel to investigate the matter , said the market &apos;s adverse reaction to news of its establishment made little sense . 
the rand was hit on Friday when Manuel announced the committee was studying the provision of forward cover . 
dealers said since the Reserve Bank had protected the rand to a large extent via intervention in the forward market , there were fears the inquiry might result in curbs on its future capacity to intervene in this way . 
but van Zyl told Reuters the inquiry was purely focused on the long-term market beyond one year . 
intervention was not relevant in this area , he said . 
&quot; Intervention by the Reserve Bank does not impact on the long-term forward book of the Bank . 
intervention impacts primarily on the net foreign exchange reserves and / or on the short-term forward book , &quot; he said . 
&quot; For the market to react in any way negatively , I find rather odd ... We are definitely not doing this with a view to creating any shock to the system . 
van Zyl said the committee had already talked to most major participants in the long-term forward market and is expected to report to Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals and Manuel early next year . 
&quot; We are at the moment , writing it up and looking at it with a view to making recommendations to Dr Stals and eventually , the minister ... I believe very early next year , we will submit a document to the Governor . 
van Zyl said the aim was to establish whether the central bank still needed to provide long-term forward cover . 
&quot; The question is whether we should be there at all . 
if we are , under what conditions should we be there ? 
what should the pricing be like ? 
should that be changed ? 
he said it was also the central bank &apos;s intention to reduce its role in the short-term forward cover market eventually , but this was not on the cards at present . 
&quot; There is no question about it that the Bank and the department of finance would like to be out of the shorter-term forward market . 
but I think for the immediate future , that will be very difficult to achieve , &quot; he said . 
the Bank &apos;s plan to withdraw gradually from the forward forex market has been disrupted by the fall in the rand this year , which triggered a scramble for cover that could only be met by the central bank . 
Bank Governor Chris Stals said at the end of August that the Bank &apos;s net oversold foreign exchange position had risen at that stage to over $ 15 billion from $ 8.1 in February . 
van Zyl said companies likely to be most affected by any move in the long-term cover market were parastatals . 
Parastatals have borrowed large amounts offshore for periods up to 10 years , routinely covering the exchange risk with the Reserve Bank which is now sitting on some very large losses due to the fall in the rand .
