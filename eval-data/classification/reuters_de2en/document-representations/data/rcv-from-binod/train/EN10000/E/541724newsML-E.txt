German Finance Minister Theo Waigel is considering revaluing the gold reserves of the central bank , the Bundesbank , the news weekly Focus reported on Saturday . 
in an advance release from Monday &apos;s edition , Focus said Waigel had suggested to a recent meeting of the parliamentary budget committee that the reserves , currently valued in the Bundesbank &apos;s books at 17 billion marks ( $ 9.8 billion ) , should instead be valued nearer to their market price , at around 70 billion marks . 
the magazine said Waigel had , however , reaffirmed the government &apos;s line that the reserves should not be sold . 
the Bundesbank and the government have always argued that the reserves are an expression of their determination to maintain a stable currency , and will not be used to solve budgetary problems . 
the Finance Ministry was not able to comment immediately on the details of the report , and the Bundesbank could not be reached for comment .
