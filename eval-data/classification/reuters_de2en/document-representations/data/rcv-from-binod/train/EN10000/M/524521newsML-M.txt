* AUD holding onto most of Monday &apos;s 1 / 2 cent gain but unable to crack resistance beyond $ 0.7785 , making analysts cautious 
* Clearance of $ 0.7820 needed to get a true recovery going , otherwise more sideways trading with risk of yet seeing $ 0.7680 
* Verdict on Living Wage case , at 2.00 pm , could stoke speculation the RBA will ease again , or kill the talk entirely 
it finished at US $ 0.7765 / 70 here Monday after rallying from a US $ 0.7720 , a level which had provided good support recently and was seen as the bulwark the bears had to break . 
the target for die-hard bulls was US $ 0.7820 , a breach of which would suggest a more meaningful rally was possible to 79 cents . 
on the crosses , the European currencies were the big movers with the mark gaining at the French franc &apos;s expense after the French government called an early election . 
the local dollar softened slightly on the mark but actually fared better than the U.S. dollar which slipped below 1.7000 . 
it was steady at 97.45 / 55 yen and traders expected little investor interest this side of the weekend G7 meeting , which might just produce concerted intervention to rein in US $ / yen . 
all this may change depending on what the Industrial Relations Commission decides on the Living Wage claim . 
the country &apos;s main trade union body has asked for an 8.75 percent increase in award wages and three annual A $ 20 per week pay rises for the lower paid . 
the government argued for a rise of just A $ 8 a week and the court is likely to come down somewhere between . 
the Reserve Bank , for its part , warned that granting the full claim would add over 1.6 percent to annual wages growth and could ultimately force it to tighten policy to keep underlying inflation in the 2-3 percent target band . 
the higher the settlement , therefore , the less chance there would be of another rate cut and the more supportive for the dollar . 
analysts , however , expect an award of around A $ 12 a week which would add only a modest 0.5 percent to wages growth . 
they felt the RBA could live with a result around there and anything lower would provide more scope for an easing should the bank feel one warranted .
