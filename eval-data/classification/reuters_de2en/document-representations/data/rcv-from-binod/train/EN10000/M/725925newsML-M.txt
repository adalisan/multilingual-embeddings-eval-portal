stocks ended higher Monday , with technology stocks extending their torrid run and blue chips scratching out slender gains . 
the Dow Jones industrial average ended up 1.16 points at 7,922.98 . 
the Nasdaq index rose 21.26 points to 1,523.88 , extending its streak of consecutive record closes to eight , as investors flocked to the suddenly sizzling tech sector . 
in the broader market , advancing issues led declines 1,471 to 1,375 on moderate volume of 485 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
the tech stocks face a critical series of earnings-related tests this week , with reports due from industry bellwether companies Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. 
&quot; We get Intel tomorrow and Microsoft on Thursday , &quot; said Guy Truicko , portfolio manager at Unity Management , &quot; and this trend could either break or continue right on , based on what those two companies say . 
Intel warned in late May that its second quarter earnings would fall short of earlier forecasts due to product transition issues . 
investors have apparently decided the worst is already passed , analysts said . 
&quot; Right now , the market is certainly telling us it expects good news , &quot; Truicko said . 
Intel rose 1-7 / 8 to 78-3 / 4 , and Microsoft surged 6-3 / 16 to 135-15 / 16 . 
at the same time tech stocks have shot higher , the Dow has stalled a bit , remaining stuck just below the 8,000 mark since closing at 7,895.81 on July 3 . 
while analysts are not expecting a stiff blue chip correction , they say the milestone may remain elusive for a while longer , as investors flock to the once again favoured technology group . 
&quot; Many players in the large caps were there for the short term and they don &apos;t want to be buying here , when a lot of those stocks are quite expensive , &quot; said Peggy Farley , chief executive at Amas Securities . 
&quot; On the other hand , a lot of the techs had been neglected or just overlooked , &quot; she said . 
&quot; Once they started going up , people just got more comfortable with them again . 
the quarterly corporate earnings season started in earnest Monday , with a flurry of banking companies that reported profits in line with or slightly above Wall Street forecasts .
