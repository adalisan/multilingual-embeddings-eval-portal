Chilean blue chips retreated to close weaker in thin trade with volume boosted by an auction of shares in Banco Santander &apos;s Chilean holding company , said dealers . 
the Bolsa is seen drifting slightly lower at the opening with the selective IPSA index likley to find resistance at 96-96.5 points , they said . 
turnover was 14.9 billion pesos of which nearly 10 billion pesos was from the pre-arranged sale of Santander stock to local institutional investors , said brokers . 
Santander raised a total of $ 137 million through the share issue to private and institutional investors which will pay for part of its purchase of Banco Osorno . 
the light volume reflected the lack of foreign interest due to the U.S. presidential elections , said dealers . 
risers included supermarket chain Santa Isabel on speculation that the company is in talks to buy a local supermarket chain and is also close to reaching a deal with a foreign supermarket firm , said traders . 
Santa Isabel , Chile &apos;s largest supermarket chain , was not immediately available for comment . 
Santa Isabel ended up 1.3 percent at 760 pesos . 
losers included forestry stocks as a long-awaited rally in cellulose prices in early November failed to materialize , said traders .
