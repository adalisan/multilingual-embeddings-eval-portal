Japan , scheduled to host this December &apos;s global warming conference in Kyoto , offered a yardstick this week for results it hopes will be achieved in multilateral climate talks set to begin in Bonn on Thursday . 
dogged by international criticism for failing to take a leadership role in the talks , Japan has stressed that developed countries must use the Bonn meeting to find common ground on which greenhouse gases to cut if they are to pinpoint numerical targets for reductions at a final preparatory meeting on October 27 . 
&quot; If numerical targets are to be achieved ahead of December , we will first need to establish a very clear idea about what kind of gases are included and need to be cut , &quot; a top Foreign Ministry official told Reuters before his departure for Bonn on Tuesday . 
the official said that Japan advocates carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) limitations , because such emissions can be easily and accurately measured . 
the United States , meanwhile , is proposing that all greenhouse gases be included in the cuts , while the European Union suggests cutting a basket of gases including methane and nitrous oxide ( N2O ) , the official said . 
&quot; We have to attach the greatest priority to solving these differences at the Bonn meeting , &quot; the official added . 
the Kyoto conference , officially titled the Third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP3 ) , is slated as the venue for signing a protocol to impose binding limitations on emissions from industrialised countries over the next 10 years . 
the conference follows up on the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro , where developed countries agreed to cut CO2 output to 1990 levels by 2000 .
