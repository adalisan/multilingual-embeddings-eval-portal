its latest crisis with the PLO over Jewish settlement building defused for the moment , Israel still finds itself without a formula for putting substantive peace negotiations back on track . 
on Monday , Israel &apos;s Interior Ministry suspended a permit held by a U.S. Jewish land baron to build 70 homes in Arab East Jerusalem &apos;s Ras al-Amoud until an appeal by two Jerusalem city council members against the plan is heard on August 5 . 
Palestinians were pleased at the move but demanded Israel also halt the Har Homa Jewish settlement on an Arab East Jerusalem hill known in Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim . 
Israel broke ground on that 6,500-home project in March . 
the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) says any settlement building in Arab areas Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war pre-empts final peace talks . 
it refuses to resume those talks in earnest if settlement continues . 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes the Ras al-Amoud plan as badly timed . 
he refuses to stop Har Homa . 
PLO negotiator Nabil Shaath said after talks with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy on Monday that suspension of the Ras al-Amoud permit improved the atmosphere between the sides . 
levy and Shaath agreed that joint Israeli-PLO committees would renew talks on outstanding issues from a 1995 peace deal : opening Gaza air and sea ports , &quot; safe passage &quot; for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza Strip and release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel . 
Shaath said the resumption of committees signalled &quot; the desire to go the second phase &quot; but said : &quot; The issues upon which this deadlock developed still await solution : the issues of settlement , Jerusalem , and the return to ( final ) negotiations &quot; . 
Saeb Erekat , the PLO &apos;s senior negotiator , earlier accused Netanyahu of using the Ras al-Amoud project to appear &quot; dovish &quot; to the world and divert attention from the larger settlement . 
&quot; If settlement activities continue , there really would be no peace process , &quot; Erekat told Reuters . 
Israel &apos;s Channel Two Television said Netanyahu , who said he first heard of the permits for the Ras al-Amoud project on Thursday after the Jerusalem municipality approved them , had been briefed on the plan two days before by Israel &apos;s Interior Minister Eliahu Suissa . 
Suissa in a statement to the media confirmed he met Netanyahu on Tuesday and briefed him on a wide range of issues , from local elections to the pending Ras al-Amoud project . 
&quot; The prime minister directed on that issue that the delay in plans continue , &quot; Suissa said , backing Netanyahu &apos;s claim that the granting of the permit two days later took him by surprise . 
while tempers cooled in Jerusalem they began to rise again in Hebron , scene of weeks of Arab-Israeli clashes last month . 
Palestinians said the army was preventing about 150 shops from opening near the dividing line between Israeli- and Palestinian-controlled parts of the town on Monday . 
the army arrested 20 Arabs in Hebron late on Sunday after protesters threw several homemade bombs at soldiers , they said . 
in Washington , doubts surfaced Congress would extend a law providing U.S. aid to the Palestinians which is set to expire on August 12 . 
the State Department said it wanted aid to continue , but anti-Palestinian sentiment has been rising in Congress . 
ending aid to the Palestinians would be another major blow to the struggling Middle East peace process .
