people given temporary shelter in a European Union country after fleeing problems back home should be given the right to work , send their children to school and have babies , the European Commission said on Wednesday . 
spurred on by the lack of a coordinated EU response when 800,000 people fled Bosnia to seek protection in the bloc , the Commission said the EU should adopt a joint system for providing temporary protection , guaranteeing basic rights . 
&quot; I do not think that what happened in Bosnia is going to be the last phenomenon of that kind , &quot; the EU &apos;s Justice Commissioner Anita Gradin told a news conference . 
the proposal is not likely to affect any outflow of people from the Balkan state of Albania , mired in violent unrest , as it must be approved by EU justice ministers , who will not discuss it until the end of May , Gradin said . 
under the 1951 Geneva convention on the status of refugees , asylum seekers must be examined on a case by case basis by the host country . 
when the number of asylum seekers is so great in a crisis that individual vetting is not realistic , countries resort to temporary protection measures and at present EU countries have different approaches . 
in Denmark and Greece for example , people given temporary shelter are not allowed to work , unlike in Sweden . 
in Finland they are entitled to unemployment benefits . 
in Denmark , Greece and Luxembourg such people do not have the right to send for their family , but in Belgium and Ireland they do . 
in Italy they have no right to social assistance , while France and Portugal have no official arrangement for giving their children schooling . 
once agreed , the EU would set up a joint decision-making mechanism for opening up , prolonging and phasing out a temporary protection regime . 
under the proposal , the first for an EU instrument in the asylum field , the EU executive would make an annual report on the situation in refugees &apos; country of origin and in each EU country . 
the Commission said it wanted to set a minimum threshold for basic rights and benefits for the people under protection . 
&quot; They should be able to support themselves , be able to reunite their immediate family at least , send their children to school , &quot; Gradin said .
