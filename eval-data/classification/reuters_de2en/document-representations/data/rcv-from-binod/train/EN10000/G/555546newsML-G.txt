armed bandits are running wild in southern Albania as unchecked lawlessness replaces the popular protests that exploded three months ago . 
Albanians who took to the streets after they lost their life savings when high-interest investment funds collapsed in January are now facing another threat -- rule by the gun . 
by day , there is regular gunfire in the suburbs of Vlore even though armed police patrol the streets of the town and shops , cafes and small businesses are open for trade . 
but by night , the gunfire over the harbour in the centre of town is continuous as armed gangs take over the streets , terrorising local residents who have also armed themselves to the teeth from looted military depots for self-protection . 
&quot; We know these gangs that are committing many crimes , robberies , killings , looting , and up to a point we are documenting their activites , &quot; Vlore police chief Milto Kordha told Reuters . 
&quot; But we cannot act in these conditions . 
the courts are not working , the prosecutor &apos;s office is not working , the police force is not strong enough or adequately equipped . 
local residents dismiss statements by politicians in the capital Tirana that it is left-wing extremists and communist rebels who now control southern Albanian towns where riots erupted in March over the failed investment funds . 
the more prosperous south , a hub for drugs smuggling and the transport of illegal immigrants , was hardest hit by the collapse of the pyramid funds that sprang up after the fall of communism in 1990 . 
most investors were from this area . 
&quot; There are no rebels here . 
this is not a rebel town . 
the problem here is armed bandits . 
they are everywhere , &quot; pensioner Dushan Qendro , 65 , told Reuters . 
the police and army fled town during the unrest in early March . 
for two weeks the only administration was provided by groups of residents who formed &quot; salvation committees &quot; that organised mass meetings and tried to maintain basic services . 
the salvation committees also demanded the resignation of Albanian President Sali Berisha , whom they accuse of failing to stop the pyramid disaster despite warnings from the World Bank and IMF . 
&quot; These committees were created for a very noble purpose , &quot; said Medin Xhelili , a former member of the Vlore committee and chairman of an elected district council that started work again on March 18 . 
the protests have had an impact politically and Berisha &apos;s Democratic Party , which basked in the glow of the pyramid funds while they continued to pay out , has suffered . 
popular pressure forced the resignation of the Democratic government which had returned to power with a landslide majority in May 1996 in elections seen internationally as flawed . 
Berisha agreed to call a new general election , expected to take place on June 29 , and appointed a multi-party interim government . 
however the president says the salvation committees have political motives and are the armed wing of the opposition Socialists . 
he wants them disbanded before the election . 
interim Prime Minister Bashkim Fino , a Socialist , has defended the committees , which he says stopped the slide to anarchy . 
but he says he has nothing to do with them . 
&quot; Their work of the first days .. should be appreciated not only by me but also by Berisha and the Democrats , &quot; Fino told Reuters . 
&quot; The criminals bands ... have nothing in common with these citizens &apos; committees . 
the salvation committees in Vlore and other southern towns have strong popular support and deny being armed or linked to criminal gangs that roam the area . 
&quot; If the salvation committees had not been here , I would not be working today , &quot; said Armando Gjeci , a market trader in Vlore . 
&quot; They saved this town . 
head of the Vlore Salvation Committee , Albert Shyti , 26 , says the committees have no political motives or origins . 
&quot; We just want to get the town back on its feet and are working with local government and the police , &quot; Shyti said . 
&quot; Our only political demand was the resignation of Berisha . 
we have no relationship at all with any political party . 
&quot; We were set up only to get our money back ... but now politicians are exploiting us . 
but no matter what government is in power we will continue until we get our money back .
