trade in Plains feedlot cattle was at a standstill on Friday with packers appearing to have plenty of inventory after heavy purchases earlier in the week , feedlot sources said . 
&quot; I haven &apos;t even heard a bid this morning , &quot; a Texas feedlot source said . 
they noted the focus had switched to the outlook for next week &apos;s trade with some expecting sales at either a steady $ 66.00 per cwt or maybe $ 1.00 higher at $ 67.00 . 
sentiment has been boosted by talk that showlists in both Kansas and Texas should be slightly smaller next week . 
Kansas cattle feeders said that state &apos;s showlist should be as much as 5,000 head down from this week &apos;s 95,000 while in Texas the showlist was seen down 2,000 head at around 102,000 . 
&quot; The list is going to be down some , beef is moving and I think we maybe have a shot at being higher next week , &quot; one Kansas source said . 
dealers said the key was whether beef movement would be maintained after a recent sharp advance in prices to the highest levels since December .
