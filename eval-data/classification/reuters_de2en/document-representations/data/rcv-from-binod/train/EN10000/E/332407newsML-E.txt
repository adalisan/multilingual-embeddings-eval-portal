the Department of Trade and Industry ( DTI ) said on Friday that Hong Kong was the top investor in the country in 1996 . 
documents from the government agency showed that equity investments of Hong Kong companies amounted to 7.33 billion pesos , a 645 percent increase over the 1995 figure . 
trade Undersecretary Melito Salazar said the presence of more Hong Kong investors in the country may be due to intensified efforts by the government to attract Hong Kong-based companies in anticipation of the colony &apos;s return to mainland China by July . 
the DTI added that last year 32 new multinational companies have decided to locate their regional headquarters in the country . 
as of end 1996 , 116 companies have set up their regional headquarters here based on their registration with the Board of Investments .
