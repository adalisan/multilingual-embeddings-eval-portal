China opened on Saturday the annual session of its National People &apos;s Congress , or parliament with a minute of silence for late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping . 
it was the first time for nearly two decades that Deng , who died last week at 92 , had not been present or at least an absentee member of the presidium of China &apos;s rubber-stamp parliament . 
the session opened with a speech by Premier Li Peng , in which it sets a target of 8.0 percent growth and pledges to accelerate reform to force loss-making state enterprises to sink or swim in the market-place . 
he also takes a less hardline stand toward Taiwan , after threatening force to recover the island last year , and hails improvements in relations with the United States .
