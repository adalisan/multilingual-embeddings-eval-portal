investment in plant and equipment will be the main engine for growth in the German economy after exports , Ulrich Ramm , chief economist of Germany &apos;s Commerzbank AG told journalists late on Monday . 
Ramm said he expected investment in plant and equipment to increase by 6.3 percent in the current year and by eight percent in 1998 . 
Commerzbank &apos;s overall outlook for GDP growth in 1997 was 2.5 percent , rising to 2.8 percent in 1998 . 
Ramm forecast a rise in inflation in 1998 to around two percent from 1.5 percent this year . 
on the possibility of a rise in key interest rates , which are currently set at three percent , Ramm said the Bundesbank might consider a slight rise in the autumn . 
&quot; The rate rise will not be enough to stop the rise of the share market , &quot; Ramm said . 
consumer spending could increase by around 2.5 percent in 1998 , compared to 1.3 percent this year , as self-employed income and transfer payments increase . 
Ramm forecast a rise of 180,000 in the average numbers in work between the first quarter of 1997 and the first quarter of 1999 , while the number of unemployed would fall by around 140,000 . 
the government has forecast average unemployment of 3.95 million for 1977 , but a number of analysts believe it will be higher .
