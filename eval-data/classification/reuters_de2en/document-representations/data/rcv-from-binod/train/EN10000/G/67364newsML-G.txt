three supporters of Sri Lanka &apos;s main opposition party were shot dead in an attack on a motorcade carrying President Chandrika Kumaratunga &apos;s estranged brother on Friday , police and a party spokesman said . 
Anura Bandaranaike , Kumaratunga &apos;s brother who is a member of parliament from the main opposition United National Party ( UNP ) , was travelling in one of the vehicles in the motorcade but was unharmed , the spokesman said . 
several bystanders were wounded . 
Bandaranaike , an ardent critic of the government and its policies , and his party were returning to Colombo from Negombo , 25 miles ( 40 km ) north of the capital , when unidentified gunmen opened fire on one of the vehicles , he added . 
they had attended a court hearing in the coastal town in connection with a previous shooting incident there in which two supporters of Kumaratunga &apos;s ruling People &apos;s Alliance were killed . 
supporters of the two parties have clashed from time to time since the People &apos;s Alliance ended the UNP &apos;s 17-year rule in 1994 . 
the UNP , saying Kumartunga was too hostile towards the opposition , has threatened to withdraw its support in parliament for a crucial peace plan which the government has proposed to end the island &apos;s 13-year old ethnic war with separatist guarrillas . 
Kumaratunga has publicly criticised the UNP for brutalising opposition supporters and muzzling the media during its rule .
