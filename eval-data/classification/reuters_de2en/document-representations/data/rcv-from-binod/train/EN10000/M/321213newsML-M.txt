a senior Finance Ministry official said on Tuesday that Treasury bills and government bonds auctioned on Wednesday would be tax-exempt because of questions over how a profits tax would be extended to such paper . 
&quot; The question of how they ( GKOs and OFZs ) will be taxed is not yet decided , &quot; said Bella Zlatkis , head of the ministry &apos;s securities and financial markets department . 
&quot; For that reason , we have changed the parameters of tommorow &apos;s auction and will place issues which are not taxable . 
a Russian law which took effect on Tuesday and applies to new issues only imposes a 43 percent tax rate on profits on government securities for banks and a 35 percent rate for others . 
Zlatkis said the State Tax Service would play a large role in deciding over the next three days how the new tax law would work , but she said the Justice Ministry might not approve of the mechanism . 
she gave no further details . 
the Finance Ministry will auction 7.00 trillion roubles of a new tranche of 154-day GKO discount Treasury bills maturing June 11 on Wednesday in place of 7.50 trillion roubles of 280-day bills scheduled earlier , the Central Bank said . 
the Series 22066 tranche will replace the planned Series 22069 . 
a Central Bank spokesman said the ministry would not alter plans to issue a 637-day 3.00 trillion rouble tranche of OFZ government bonds .
