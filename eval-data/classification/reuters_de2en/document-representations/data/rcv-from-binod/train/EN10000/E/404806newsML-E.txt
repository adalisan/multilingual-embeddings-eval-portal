Portugal &apos;s Finance Minister Antonio Sousa Franco said that interest rates should fall steadily in 1997 and the spread between Portuguese and German rates should continue to narrow . 
&quot; I believe the conditions are there for a bigger cut in the spreads ( with Germany ) and a steady continuation in the trend to lower interest rates , &quot; Sousa Franco said . 
the temporary reversal of the trend in January had been due to some &quot; unfortunate &quot; political statements that had had a negative impact on the markets , he said in reference to remarks by some northern European political leaders about the wisdom of southern European countries joining the single currency . 
&quot; The situation is returning to normal , &quot; he added . 
the spread between Portugal &apos;s benchmark 10-year bond and the Bund equivalent is around 112 basis points against a low of 80 basis points reached earlier in January .
