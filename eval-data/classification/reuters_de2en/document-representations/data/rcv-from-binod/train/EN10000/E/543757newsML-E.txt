North Korea wants to join the Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) and the bank &apos;s member-nations will be formally informed of its request shortly , a top ADB official said on Monday . 
&quot; North Korea has expressed strong interest in joining this institution and we are now in a position to tell existing members of the request , &quot; ADB president Mitsuo Sato told Reuters in an interview . 
the Manila-based financial institution which is owned by 56 countries was formed 30 years ago to help steer Asia &apos;s economic development . 
besides lending on commercial terms , the bank grants soft loans to the poorest countries in the region . 
North Korea &apos;s request would be passed on to the ADB &apos;s 12 board directors who would in turn inform the member countries . 
Sato said North Korea &apos;s admission to the bank would depend on how many members supported it . 
Member-nations had not expressed their views on the subject since they had not yet been formally told of North Korea &apos;s request , he said . 
if the request was favourably received the ADB could start negotiating the terms of entry . 
to become a member Pyongyang would be expected to contribute to the bank &apos;s capital . 
North Korea officially applied for membership of the Manila-based institution in 1992 , but the bank decided its entry bid was premature . 
Communist North Korea , which has isolated itself from the rest of the world , is in economic crisis and much of its population are believed to be facing starvation .
