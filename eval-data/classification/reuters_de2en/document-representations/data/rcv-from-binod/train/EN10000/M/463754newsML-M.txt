the German stock market , trading at or near record levels in recent weeks , looks set to advance further if tax reforms boost the economy and corporate earnings , analysts said on Monday . 
finance Minister Theo Waigel &apos;s tax reform programme is still at the proposal stage but while debate is raging over measures affecting private individuals , the package for corporate tax payers has met with more approval . 
the reform programme , due to begin in 1998 , is based around basic notions of simplifying Germany &apos;s often arcane tax law , broadening the tax base and lowering tax rates and the net burden of taxation . 
Bonn plans to abolish corporate wealth tax and cut taxes on retained earnings in two steps from 45 percent to 40 percent in 1998 and 35 percent in 1999 . 
the tax rate on distributed earnings would be cut from 30 to 25 percent , while the unpopular solidarity surcharge to finance aid to eastern Germany will be trimmed from 7.5 percent to 5.5 percent . 
to pay for all this , the German government plans measures to revalue assets , reduce depreciation allowances and limit provisions for pending risks . 
&quot; All of these measures create buoyancy for corporate after-tax earnings . 
tax rates will fall , even if the absolute level of taxes payable might rise for individual companies , &quot; Ralf Conen , analyst at Salomon Brothers in London , said in a report on the effects of tax reform on the German economy . 
a study by Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt says net profits of companies stand to rise by an additional 9.4 percent in 1998 and 6.7 percent in 1999 as a result of the tax reform , assuming 40 percent of their profit is made abroad . 
&quot; Tax reform would lift in particular the net profits of those companies which show a high measure of domestic profits and / or high rates of depreciation and / or earnings retention . 
those are mainly the utilities , insurers and the carmakers , &quot; the Julius Baer report said . 
around 60 percent of total earnings from companies in the 30-share blue-chip DAX index are taxed in Germany . 
according to the Salomon Brothers report , simulations show that the positive impact on corporate after-tax profits stemming exclusively from the rate cuts will be 15 to 20 percent in the next two years . 
in contrast to the bull run of the stock market in 1996 , Salomon expects the impact this time to filter through into second- and third-line stocks . 
both the MDAX , which is the index of the 70 medium-sized stocks following the DAX index , and the CDAX , which is the composite indicator comprising all officially listed stocks , have tracked or even outperformed their big brother . 
the Julius Baer report says the DAX would be fairly valued at 3,500 points once the tax reform is included , while Salomon finds the DAX fairly valued at 3,700 once the tax reform is factored in . 
the DAX index ended bourse trade in Frankfurt on Monday at 3,321.84 , up 23.60 points or 0.72 percent . 
while the view in both studies is upbeat overall , there are potential downsides . 
chief among these are fears of a delay to the start of European economic and monetary Union on January 1 , 1999 , which could create market turbulence .
