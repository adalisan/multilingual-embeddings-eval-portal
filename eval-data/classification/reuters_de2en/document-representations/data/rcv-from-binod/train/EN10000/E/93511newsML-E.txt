Hungary will probably not reduce its six percent import customs duty surcharge in January as previously planned , a senior Finance Ministry official said on Thursday . 
Deputy State Secretary Tamas Tetenyi was quoted by the Hungarian daily Vilaggazdasag on Thursday as saying the surcharge would almost certainly not be cut in January as import duty will be reduced from next year anyway . 
Hungary said earlier this year it planned three reductions of two points in 1997 , on January 1 , April 1 and June 30 . 
the government has not made a final decision about the schedule of the cuts , but it has international obligations to liquidate the surcharge by July 1 , 1997 . 
finance Minister Peter Medgyessy , introducing the 1997 darft budget to the press last week , said that Hungary would fulfil the obligations . 
he said on Saturday that Hungary would take import figures and competitiveness into account when deciding about the pace of abolishing the surcharge . 
&quot; With the rate ( of cuts ) and the pace , we have to take into account that economic growth goes along with import growth , and we need gradualness ( in reducing the surcharge ) to keep up competitiveness , &quot; he told the daily Nepszabadsag .
