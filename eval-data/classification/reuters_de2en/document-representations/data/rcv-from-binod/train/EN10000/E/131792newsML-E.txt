British retail sales are expected to have slowed in September but would not disguise the fact the trend in consumer spending is firmly upwards , economists said . 
a Reuter poll of economists produced a consensus forecast that sales will fall 0.1 percent in September , leaving them 3.9 percent higher year-on-year . 
but given that sales shot up by 1.0 percent in August and anecdotal evidence suggests consumers are spending freely again in October , there is no question of a prolonged slowdown , economists said . 
&quot; It is becoming increasingly clear that the long-awaited pick-up in retail fortunes has arrived , &quot; said Philip Uglow , economist at Union plc . 
but as the Confederation of British Industry &apos;s distributive trades survey for September showed retail sales grew at a slower pace than in August , as did the British Retail Consortium &apos;s sales monitor , there could be a temporary hiatus , he said . 
the BRC survey showed retail sales up 5.2 percent year-on-year in September , compared with growth of 6.9 percent in August . 
&quot; Both imply a small fall in official sales in September , &quot; Uglow said . 
David Philpotts , UK economist at Schroders , noted that weekly sales figures from stores and supermarkets group John Lewis Partnership , had also waned a little in September . 
&quot; We look for a small monthly decline but this will not negate the upward trend , &quot; he said , adding that John Lewis and weekly M0 money supply figures so far in October suggested sales have picked up again . 
Michael Saunders , UK economist at Salomon Brothers , said rocketing clothing and footwear prices in September were likely to have forced sales volumes lower in that sector . 
retail price figures , released earlier this month , showed clothing and footwear prices leapt by 5.2 percent last month , the biggest jump since records began in 1947 . 
&quot; There are several signs that retail sales slipped back in September , &quot; Saunders said , highlighting evidence from the CBI , BRC and John Lewis . 
&quot; Even with a modest dip in spending in September , however , the trend in third-quarter retail sales is likely to remain reasonably buoyant . 
he forecast a 0.3 percent fall in September sales , more extreme than the market consensus , but said even that would leave third quarter sales 0.9 percent higher than in the second quarter .
