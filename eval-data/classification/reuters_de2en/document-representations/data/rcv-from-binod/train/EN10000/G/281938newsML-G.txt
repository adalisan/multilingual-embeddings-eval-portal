Peruvian Marxist guerrillas released a further two hostages at 5 p.m. ( 2200 GMT ) from the besieged Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence in Lima , witnesses said . 
the two men walked out apparently in good health , accompanied by Red Cross officials . 
red Cross chief representative Michel Minnig identified the two men as Honduran ambassador Jose Eduardo Martell Mejia and Argentine consul general Juan Ibanez . 
both men were dressed in suits and carried plastic bags with personal belongings . 
they hugged Red Cross officials , and the immaculate-looking Ibanez , wearing a necktie , waved at waiting reporters . 
the pair were driven away in a police car , leaving 81 hostages inside the building . 
the release was immediately followed by the entrance into the residence of Catholic bishop Juan Luis Cipriani , who has acted as an observer in negotiations between the rebels and the government .
