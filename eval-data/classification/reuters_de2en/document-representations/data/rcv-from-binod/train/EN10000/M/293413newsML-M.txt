Brazil &apos;s real dropped 0.16 percent to close at 1.0418 per greenback in speculative trade on the commercial foreign exchange market , dealers said . 
players speculated on dollar outflows througout the day and over a lowering of the real-dollar mini-band in coming days . 
the market was also concerned about talk of a possible $ 1 billion trade deficit in January . 
the Central Bank lowered the mini-band 0.1 percent on Monday to between 1.0400 and 1.0450 reais per dollar and some players were expecting another 0.1 percent decline before the end of the week . 
this expectation led banks to cover short positions by buying dollars . 
by late afternoon , there were no signs of dollar outflows , with preliminary figures for commercial and financial foreign exchange contracts showing a Wednesday surplus of $ 150 million . 
but dealers believed net dollar flows could show a deficit after all transactions are registered at the end of the day . 
in the interbank foreign exchange floating rate market , the real ended flat at 1.0457 per dollar . 
in the illegal parallel market , the real fell 0.89 percent to close at 1.135 real per greenback due to a reduction in the supply of dollars , traders said .
