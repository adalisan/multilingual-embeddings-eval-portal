one phone call after his dramatic fall at last year &apos;s Atlanta Olympics gave Hicham el Guerrouj the strength to carry on . 
Moroccan el Guerrouj , who will start favourite in Wednesday &apos;s 1,500 metres finals at the world championships , was in a state of shock after crashing to the track in the Atlanta 1,500 final . 
&quot; A few days later , King Hassan called him to tell him that it was not the end of the world and that the Moroccan people viewed him as the winner of the race , &quot; Moroccan team coach Aziz Daouda said on Tuesday . 
EL Guerrouj added : &quot; A new el Guerrouj was born after that phone call . 
it made me forget what had happened and from that day , I just trained very hard to become a world champion . 
the Moroccan fell after tripping over Noureddine Morceli &apos;s foot while making a move to the front . 
Morceli went on to add the Olympic title to his three world golds . 
&quot; We viewed the video over and over again and it was an accident , &quot; said Daouda , &quot; Morceli didn &apos;t intend to make him fall . 
EL Guerrouj soon regained his composure , remaining undefeated in the 1,500 for the remainder of the season and beating Morceli in the Grand Prix final in Milan in September . 
after that win , he returned to Morocco to prepare in the luxurious national training camp in Rabat , housed in what was once a four-star hotel with wooded trails and a stadium track near by . 
then the indoor season came , allowing el Guerrouj to set world records in both the mile and 1,500 . 
the latter was the most impressive as el Guerrouj clocked three minutes 31.18 seconds , breaking Morceli &apos;s previous mark by almost three seconds . 
EL Guerrouj looked just as awesome at the start of this year &apos;s outdoor season , clocking the three fastest times including a year &apos;s best of 3 : 29.30 last month in Stockholm . 
&quot; Hicham is ready , &quot; said his personal coach , Abdelkader Kada . 
&quot; Not only has he the ability to win the title but I think he can become one of the greatest middle distance runners of all time . 
even the fact that compatriots Driss Maazouzi and Salah El Gazzi failed to qualify for the final did not dent el Guerrouj &apos;s confidence . 
&quot; It &apos;s a pity but I can manage on my own , &quot; he said . 
&quot; If there &apos;s no pushing like in Atlanta , if it &apos;s a regular race , I should be all right .
