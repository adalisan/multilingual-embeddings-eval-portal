Polish central bank president Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz warned that excessive credit growth in the next two months could trigger a rise in interest rates , the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper said on Saturday . 
&quot; If in July and August banks extend too many loans it may become necessary to raise interest rates , &quot; the paper quoted Gronkiewicz-Waltz as saying at a seminar in the central city of Lodz . 
the National Bank of Poland has long voiced concern over rapid credit expansion and booming domestic demand and the resulting widening trade and current account deficits . 
in order to tighten its grip on money supply the central bank has kept its official Lombard and discount rates , now at 25 percent and 22 percent respectively , unchanged since July last year despite a steady fall in inflation . 
twice this year the NBP has also increased obligatory reserve requirements for banks to contain monetary expansion . 
earlier this month Gronkiewicz-Waltz told Reuters in an interview the bank expected no move on rates in the near term , with a rate rise likely to provoke unwanted foreign capital inflows and a rate cut made impossible by credit expansion . 
Wyborcza quoted Gronkiewicz-Waltz as predicting year-on-year inflation to fall to 13 percent at the end of this year from 14.6 percent in May and 18.5 percent at the end of 1996 . 
the government recently cut its official 1997 inflation target to 12 percent from earlier 13 percent because of a better than expected performance in the first half of the year . 
credit to the non-financial sector grew by 13.3 percent in the first five months of this year , while the current account deficit in the first four months reached $ 2.27 billion , almost $ 1 billion more than in the whole of 1996 .
