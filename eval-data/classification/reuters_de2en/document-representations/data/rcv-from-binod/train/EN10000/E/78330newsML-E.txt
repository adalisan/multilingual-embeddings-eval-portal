the Brazilian government on Thursday signed a deal to refinance 8.6 billion reais in debt held by the state of Minas Gerais , a spokesman for the state government in Belo Horizonte said . 
the spokesman said the deal allowed for Minas Gerais to swap a large part of its total net 11 billion reais in debt for 30-year federal government securities paying just 6.0 percent a year in interest . 
in return , the state must carry out a fiscal adjustment programme and transfer assets that can be privatised worth 20 percent of the refinancing deal to Brasilia . 
the Minas Gerais renegotiation follows last week &apos;s signing of a deal with Rio Grande do Sul to refinance 6.0 billion reais of the southern state &apos;s debt . 
it is expected to be followed by accords with Rio de Janeiro and Mato Grosso do Sul , seen involving 5.0 billion reais and 2.2 billion reais , respectively . 
at least 12 of Brazil &apos;s states are thought to be virtually bankrupt , unable to pay interest on federal loans . 
the total net debt of the states and municipalities stood at 83.99 billion reais in July , up from 81.926 billion reais in June .
