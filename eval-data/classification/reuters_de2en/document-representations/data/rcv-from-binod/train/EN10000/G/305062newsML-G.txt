sponsors have made Martina Hingis a multi-millionaire at 16 , putting the Swiss teenager under growing pressure to become world number one . 
Italian sportswear company Sergio Tacchini has agreed to spend at least $ 7.5 million on the Swiss player , betting that she will one day do as her vanquished opponents predict and topple Steffi Graf from the top of women &apos;s tennis . 
&quot; She starts to feel the pressure now , &quot; the company &apos;s head of sponsorship , Leo Bassi , admitted on Tuesday after announcing the five-year deal , which could bring Hingis millions of dollars more in ranking and tournament bonuses . 
&quot; She was too young only 18 months ago to feel everything . 
I still don &apos;t think she realises how much money she has , because she has no time to spend it , &quot; Bassi said . 
Hingis was burying German Barbara Rittner &apos;s hopes of an Australian Open second-round berth when the deal was announced and she merely shrugged when reporters later asked how it felt to be so rich at her age . 
you just play your tennis , &quot; she said , a little embarrassed . 
Hingis leaves the deal-making to her mother and coach , Melanie , and concentrates on matters on the court where she is , according to her peers , developing into a champion . 
&quot; She &apos;s had an incredible year . 
especially in the last few months , she seemed not afraid of playing the top players and not afraid of winning tournaments , &quot; said 21-times Grand Slam champion Graf before launching her own Australian Open campaign . 
&quot; She &apos;s definitely one of the few players who will always make life difficult , &quot; said Graf , who lost to the sometimes temperamental Hingis at last year &apos;s Italian Open . 
Hingis also notched up a victory last November over world number two Monica Seles in Oakland , becoming the youngest ever tennis player , man or woman , to earn $ 1 million in prize money at the tender age of 16 years , one month and 10 days . 
&quot; Martina is tennis , &quot; said Bassi . 
&quot; When people talk about tennis , they talk about Hingis . 
they don &apos;t talk about ( Pete ) Sampras or ( Andre ) Agassi , they talk about Hingis . 
she &apos;s the next generation , going towards 2000 .... &quot; 
&quot; Who knows ? 
maybe ( Graf ) can play one or two more years but apart from Martina we don &apos;t see any other names . 
at the moment , the best investment in tennis is Martina Hingis . 
under the contract , Hingis receives an annual retainer of $ 1.5 million for five years and stands to earn up to a total of $ 12 million over that time with performance bonuses if she reaches number one , Bassi said . 
for now , corporate pressures do not appear to weigh on the world number four , who spends her days off from the Australian Open roller-blading , horse-riding and going shopping with a fraction of the wealth accumulating in her bank account . 
asked on Tuesday if she felt pressure to perform , Hingis said : &quot; Not at all ... It &apos;s a great feeling to be out there and for people to be enjoying you playing great tennis . 
Hingis believes she will not follow in the footsteps of former teenaged prodigy Jennifer Capriati , who left the tour in 1994 complaining of burn-out and whose Grand Slam comeback ended in tears here on Tuesday . 
with some $ 10 million riding on Hingis over the next five years , Bassi has to share that belief . 
&quot; It &apos;s not possible . 
no way at all . 
it will never happen .
