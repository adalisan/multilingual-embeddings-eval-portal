the foreign minister of Sierra Leone &apos;s military junta resurfaced in the capital Freetown on Saturday and dismissed speculation about his defection . 
a United Nations official in Guinea and governent sources in Freetown said this month that Bangura had defected while attending peace talks in Ivory Coast . 
he had led the junta delegation at negotiations with West African foreign ministers on ending a crisis caused by the May 25 military coup in Sierra Leone . 
official sources in Freetown said he had either remained in Ivory Coast or gone on to Ethiopia . 
&quot; I was carrying on what is my style , and that is quiet diplomacy , &quot; Bangura told a BBC interviewer , declining to elaborate on his mission or where it took him . 
but described his diplomacy as &quot; quite successful &quot; , adding : &quot; And now we are looking for a next step . 
the coup has been condemned by the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity , who have demanded the restoration of elected president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah , exiled in Guinea . 
the Economic Comunity of West African States imposed a sea , air and land blockade of Sierra Leone and its forces , led by Nigeria , have clashed repeatedly with junta soldiers and former rebels who rallied to the coup . 
the talks broke down on July 30 when junta leader Johnny Paul Koroma said the military would retain power until 2001 .
