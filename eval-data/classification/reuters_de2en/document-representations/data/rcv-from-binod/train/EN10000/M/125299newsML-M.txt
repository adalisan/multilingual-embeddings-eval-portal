Thai finance and securities group Krungthai Thanakit plc said on Thursday a major downturn in the Thai stock market was painful now but could be beneficial in the longer term . 
&quot; It may be a bitter pill to swallow but it might just be a blessing in disguise and a lesson to the financial community about being too complacent , &quot; KTT president Phirasilp Subhapholsiri told Reuters . 
since a 1996 year high of 1415.04 in February , the Thai stock index has shed nearly 500 points , or 35 percent of its value , to close Wednesday at 916.83 . 
the decline has intensified this month as foreign funds underweighted Thai blue chip stocks . 
Phirasilp said the market would only recover when there was a sustained bout of combined foreign and domestic buying . 
he said : &quot; The years of clapping with one hand and making a sound are long gone . 
before domestic and foreign investors could rock the market , now they have to rock together , or clap with both hands . 
at the moment the foreigners are looking into the eyes of domestic investors and don &apos;t know what to think . 
with a Thai general election set for 17 November he said political factors were likely to play as great a part in the market as economic fundamentals . 
&quot; It could be very cheap looking at it . 
you might feel the market has reached the bottom but you have to take other factors , especially politics , into account .
