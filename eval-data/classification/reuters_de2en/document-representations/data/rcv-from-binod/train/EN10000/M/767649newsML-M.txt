Taiwan &apos;s central bank said on Wednesday it would issue T $ 3 billion in seven-day negotiable certificates of deposit later in the day . 
bids would close at 11.15 local time ( 0315 GMT ) , a central bank official said . 
the central bank gave no indication that it would expand the issue later in the day , as it did for the first time on Friday in a bid to check a stubborn rise in short-term interest rates . 
the new issue is seen as compensating for the maturation on Wednesday of T $ 3 billion in NCDs , dealers said . 
Taiwan &apos;s money rates closed higher on Tuesday amid tightening liquidity due to a booming stock market and depreciating Taiwan dollar . 
dealers said big turnover in the bourse was intensifying fund flows from the banking system , while the Taiwan dollar &apos;s tumble below T $ 28 to the U.S. dollar sparked concerns the central bank may intervene to support the currency . 
the rate finished at T $ 28.17 , its lowest in more than eight years .
