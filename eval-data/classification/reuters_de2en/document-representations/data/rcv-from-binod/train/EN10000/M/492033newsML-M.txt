CME live cattle futures were expected to open steady to 0.150 cent per lb higher while calls on feeder cattle futures ranged mixed , from 0.200 cent higher to 0.200 lower , livestock analysts said . 
although expectations abound that cash beef prices are close to bottoming , lower boxed beef values again late Friday were viewed as a selling factor . 
carryover of part of the showlist was also considered a selling factor , analysts said . 
bulls have been looking for beef prices to rebound as the grilling season gets under way , but weather conditions were not that favorable over the past weekend , they said . 
feeder cattle futures calls ranged mixed with some analysts looking for carryover strength linked to another gain in the latest CME feeder cattle index . 
poor calving weather should also be supportive to deferred contracts . 
but others cited expected weakness in live cattle futures and calls for higher corn futures which may pressure the market , analysts said . 
the latest CME feeder cattle index was quoted up $ 0.30 at $ 70.81 per cwt , the highest level in over two years , since March 1 , 1995 .
