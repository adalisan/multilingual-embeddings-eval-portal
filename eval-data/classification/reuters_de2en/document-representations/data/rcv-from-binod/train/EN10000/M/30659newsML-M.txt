new Zealand share prices largely ignored weakness in bond and bill markets to close stronger on Tuesday after a light session . 
the NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 6.37 points higher at 2,223.09 , off its low of 2,216.55 , on turnover worth just NZ $ 36 million . 
talk of the day centred on Air New Zealand and there was considerable jostling in the stock before the company &apos;s impending rights issue . 
Campbell Johnstone at Hendry Hay McIntosh said analysts and brokers were attempting to work out the arbitrage opportunities on the rights in terms of what level to buy the A shares and the B shares . 
the government said on Monday it had allowed the foreign ownership of Air NZ , through the &quot; B &quot; shares , to increase to 49 percent from the current 35 . 
brokers said that once the rights issue is complete , the two shares should approach parity as the liquidity in each becomes casino and hotel group Sky City fell three cents to NZ $ 6.92 after a reporting a maiden net profit of NZ $ 15.5 million for the five months to June . 
the result was in line with expectations and slightly above Sky &apos;s own forecast of NZ $ 15.0 million . 
Johnstone said that those who thought patronage at the casino would drop off were proven wrong . 
&quot; It &apos;s pretty much a fixed-cost business and they are really generating and building revenues , &quot; he said .
