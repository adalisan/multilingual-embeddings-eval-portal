Welshman Ian Woosnam won his fourth title of the season to take over from Scot Colin Montgomerie at the top of the European Order of Merit after rain washed out the last round of the German Open on Sunday . 
Woosnam was one of six players still to tee off on a day interrupted three times for thunderstorms and torrential rain when tournament director Andy McFee cancelled the fourth round and reduced the tournament to a 54-hole event . 
it left Woosnam , who has already won the Johnnie Walker classic in Singapore , the Heineken classic in Australia and the Scottish Open , on 20-under-par 193 , six shots clear of Germany &apos;s Thomas Gogele , Spaniard Fernando Roca , Sweden &apos;s Robert Karlsson and Englishman Iain Pyman . 
Montgomerie did not compete here because his father is ill . 
Woosnam said he was disappointed with the outcome because he had been hoping to shoot 28 under par overall and set a PGA European Tour record . 
&quot; It was a bit disappointing that I didn &apos;t have a chance to go for the record and it &apos;s disappointing for guys who shot good scores earlier today whose rounds have been scrapped , &quot; he said . 
new Zealander Frank Nobilo and Scotland &apos;s Andrew Coltart both shot 63 , eight under par , to move up to joint second place , but both dropped back to joint 53rd after McFee &apos;s decision . 
&quot; Andy tried to let it go on as long as possible . 
he tried his hardest to play 72 holes and it was impossible . 
&quot; Now my target is to be on top at the end of the year , so I will go out next week and try to make the gap a little bigger .
