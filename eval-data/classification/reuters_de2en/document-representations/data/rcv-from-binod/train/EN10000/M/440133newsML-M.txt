blue chips edged lower in lacklustre trade at the Bombay Stock Exchange ( BSE ) on Thursday as lack of buying support weighed on the market , dealers said . 
&quot; The markets have been pretty dull . 
Essentialy , there is only trading activity , &quot; said Vetri Subramaniam , equity trader at institutional brokerage SSKI Securities Pvt Ltd . 
the BSE &apos;s benchmark 30-share index drifted in a narrow band , ending 11.99 points lower at a provisional 3,750.38 , off the intra-day high of 3,780.16 . 
&quot; There seems to be some sort of consolidation-phase taking place , &quot; said Subramaniam . 
the Bombay index rallied nearly 16 percent to hit an eight-month high of 4,029.56 last week , as participants welcomed a market-friendly budget announced by the government . 
the proposals in the 1997 / 98 ( April-March ) budget unveiled on February 28 included a cut in corporate and personal income tax rates , raised foreign portfolio limit in domestic firms and allowed companies to buy back their shares . 
but , profit-booking at higher levels capped the post-budget gains , dealers said . 
&quot; Foreign funds and local institutions sold pivotals when the market was at the 4,000 level , &quot; said Neeraj Batra , president at Hinduja Finance . 
Batra was confident about investment buying stepping in at lower levels . 
&quot; A reaction of about 100-150 points , to the 3,600 levels will see fresh buying coming in , &quot; he said . 
shares of Castrol India surged 25.25 rupees , or 5.16 percent to close at 515.0 at the Bombay bourse with a sharp rise seen in trading volumes . 
about 496,094 shares were traded . 
dealers did not attribute any particular factor behind the price surge despite some foreign fund buying in the stock . 
the National Stock Exchange 50-stock index ended 9.15 points , or 0.85 percent , down at a provisional 1,065.05 .
