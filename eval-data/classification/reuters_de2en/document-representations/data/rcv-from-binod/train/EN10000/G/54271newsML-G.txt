Bahrain said on Sunday it had agreed to host United States military planes on the island but it was not clear whether the move was linked to the Iraqi crisis . 
the state Gulf News Agency ( GNA ) quoted an official as saying Bahrain had &quot; agreed to host a number of U.S. military planes on its territory &quot; . 
Washington has moved up additional warplanes to the Gulf including radar-evading stealth fighter-bombers now in Kuwait and B-52 bombers at the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia for possible military action against Iraq . 
GNA said Bahrain &apos;s acceptance of U.S. warplanes on the island was in the framework of a defence cooperation pact with the United States . 
it gave no further details . 
officials said U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry , who earlier arrived in Kuwait from Saudi Arabia , was due in Bahrain on Sunday and would speak at a news conference . 
Bahrain is the administrative headquarters for the U.S. Navy &apos;s Fifth Fleet which operates an aircraft carrier battle group and other warships in the tense oil-rich region . 
Bahrain was host to U.S. warplanes for about three months from last October when the carrier USS Independence left the Gulf and was replaced by the Nimitz . 
the carrier Carl Vinson is currently in the northern Gulf .
