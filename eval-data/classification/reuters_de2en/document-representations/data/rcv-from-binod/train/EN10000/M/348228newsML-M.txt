Dutch shares closed narrowly mixed on Friday after an erratic session which saw prices gain at the outset on a strong Wall Street showing overnight only to dip and then rally on after US fourth quarter GDP data . 
the AEX share index closed 0.59 points up at 675.68 , but only after diving to 669.81 just after the GDP announcement and then gaining ground as analysts examined the data . 
prices had been drifting from the morning peak of 677.94 as talk circulated the market about a billion-guilder option play related either to selling of index calls or buying of index puts , triggering index futures selling as a hedge . 
&quot; We &apos;ve been hearing stories all day about a deal worth something like a billion guilders going through the option market , &quot; said a dealer . 
&quot; The talk was that the counter parties were hedging the deal by selling futures . 
dealers said the market wobbled a little on the US GDP figures , dipping before it became clear that inflation was lower than expected and reduced the chances of a US rate hike . 
&quot; The ( implicit price ) deflator showed inflation was under control and that &apos;s why you saw the market come up in the end , &quot; a dealer said . 
the deflator came in at 1.4 percent year on year , against an anticipated 1.8 percent . 
dealers expressed disappointment that the market did not respond to the 83-point gain overnight on Wall Street , which came on the heels of Wednesday &apos;s 85-point rise , saying institutions had steered clear of the market once again . 
&quot; It &apos;s not a healthy market right now , &quot; said one . 
&quot; If you see the index it &apos;s been moving up and down by fairly large amounts . 
there &apos;s already a lot of uncertainty around and if you see markets move like this it really doesn &apos;t inspire confidence . 
some believe a correction down to 650 followed by buying could be due , while others think the upcoming corporate results season could push the AEX back up to the 686 record high . 
Philips closed a guilder higher at 74.00 , rising as the market got wind of a research note published by Goldman Sachs starting Philips as a market performer . 
earlier Philips said it was transferring multimedia interests into Intergrames of France and raising its 13.2 percent stake to an unspecified minority holding . 
Hoogovens added 3.10 guilders for a two-day gain of 4.50 guilders to 75.70 on talk of an upgrading by a major broker . 
elsewhere among the leaders Royal Dutch was up 2.80 guilders to 322.00 while Unilever fell 1.40 guilders to 304.60 .
