the Russian parliament &apos;s lower house voted almost unanimously on Friday to ratify a union treaty with the neigbouring state of Belarus . 
a total of 363 deputies in the State Duma voted for the treaty , formalising a loose union between the two Slav states . 
only two voted against . 
the treaty was signed last month by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and hardline Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko . 
&quot; The presented documents assume the most rational form of integration , allowing our two peoples to move towards each other , &quot; Deputy Prime Minister Valery Serov told deputies . 
he said the treaty was the fruit of compromise between many political forces in the two former Soviet republics . 
the deal was a watered-down version of the original draft , amended last month after liberals in the Russian government warned the original could give Lukashenko too much power and damage Russia &apos;s interests . 
the lower house of the Belarussian parliament , created after a controversial referendum last November , unanimously backed the integration deal with Russia late last month . 
the document now has to be approved by the upper chambers of both parliaments . 
Belarussian opposition activists refuse to recognise the new parliament and are fiercely opposed to the integration deal , which they say is a sell-out of Belarussian interests . 
but most Russians and Belarussians , nostalgic for the Soviet Union which collapsed in 1991 , support integration moves between their two states . 
Serov said the treaty had potential to be expanded , so the two countries could hold a referendum after two or four years on a closer merger .
