Syrian Vice-President Abdel-Halim Khaddam returned home from Tehran on Monday and Syrian officials said he was satisfied with the outcome of his talks with Iranian leaders . 
an official who accompanied Khaddam during his visit quoted Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as telling the Syrian vice-president during talks on Monday that Iran was &quot; keen to preserve its strategic and firm ties with Syria &quot; . 
Khaddam &apos;s visit followed harsh criticism by Iran &apos;s media of Syria &apos;s approval of a decision by Arab ministers backing the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) in its dispute with Iran over ownership of three islands in the Gulf . 
in a strongly worded statement after a meeting in Cairo on December 29 , the Damascus Declaration states -- Syria , Egypt and the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- demanded that Iran withdraw from the islands in favour of the UAE . 
in Tehran , Iranian radio quoted Rafsanjani as telling Khaddam : &quot; Regional countries should avoid non-essential problems and mobilise all their capabilities against the sinister policies of those ( Israel ) who occupy Qods ( Jerusalem ) and their global backers . 
Syrian officials said khaddam , who was accompanied by Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara and other senior officials , expressed satisfaction over the outcome of his talks in Iran . 
they said that Khaddam gave Rafsanjani a message from President Hafez al-Assad dealing with regional developments , the Arab-Israeli conflict and issues of mutual concern . 
diplomats said Khaddam &apos;s talks also dealt with developments in south Lebanon where pro-Iranian Hizbollah ( Party of God ) guerrillas fight against Israeli occupation troops . 
Khaddam co-chaired with his Iranian counterpart Hassan Habibi meetings of the higher Syrian-Iranian commission which coordinates cooperation between the two states . 
Syria backed Iran during its 1980-1988 war with Iraq and the two states have maintained close ties since then .
