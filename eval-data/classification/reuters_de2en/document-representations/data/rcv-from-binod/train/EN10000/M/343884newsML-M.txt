upside on SIMEX Euroyen futures was capped on Thursday despite a sharp drop in the Nikkei share average and the yen &apos;s slight recovery against the dollar . 
&quot; It &apos;s very hard to squeeze any more upside out of the short end , especially on the front two contracts , &quot; said a European bank dealer , noting that the Bank of Japan was not expected to raise interest rates in the first half . 
he said the market was pricing in a 25 basis point hike by about the third quarter , capping the upside for September and December Euroyen . 
&quot; But the downside is also limited because nobody expects a big rate hike . 
so there &apos;s nothing to do , &quot; he added . 
&quot; There &apos;s just some bottom-picking between the December and March ( 1998 ) . 
whenever the spread narrows , we look to buy them , &quot; said a trader with a European futures house . 
he added that players were switching between the September and December contracts depending on whether economic data and the prevailing environment indicated a rate hike by the third or fourth quarters . 
December was at 99.20 against 99.18 . 
both contracts were confined to a three-tick range and traded a combined total of 9,595 lots . 
March Japanese government bond futures ended up 0.30 ticks to 126.30 on 201 lots . 
the Nikkei share average lost 471.26 points to end at 17,864.04 on Thursday . 
Eurodollar futures edged up a notch in thin trade ahead of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s testimony before the Senate Finance Committee from 1500 GMT . 
dealers said the speech would be closely watched for hints about the inflation outlook before the Fed &apos;s policy-making meeting next week . 
&quot; If Greenspan doesn &apos;t say anything new , there &apos;s a possibility that everybody could cover their shorts , &quot; said the bank dealer , noting that Eurodollars had shown a bearish bias recently . 
September was flat at 94.03 .
