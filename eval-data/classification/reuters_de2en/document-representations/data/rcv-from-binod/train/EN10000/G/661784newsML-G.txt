British mine clearance expert Christopher Howes is alive and being held 20 km ( 12 miles ) east of the Khmer Rouge stronghold of Anlong Veng , a senior Cambodian military official said . 
&quot; Christopher Howes is still alive . 
he is being detained by a Division 801 commander named Soroeun who supports Pol Pot , &quot; deputy chief of general staff Nhiek Bun Chhay said . 
Howes was kidnapped by rebels in March 1996 . 
the commander was part of a group of some 250 to 300 fighters holed up in rough jungle terrain with reviled Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot , he said . 
Pol Pot is said to be on the run after killing his own defence chief and 11 of his family members . 
Pol Pot , architect of the 1975-1979 &quot; killing fields &quot; regime , was holding at least three top officials of his guerrilla movement hostage , Nhiek Bun Chhay said . 
about 1,000 troops from five divisions have broken with Pol Pot and are surrounding him , he said , adding that division 801 was the only division still loyal to Pol Pot . 
Christopher Howes and his Cambodian translator , Houn Hourth , were abducted on March 26 last year while conducting mine clearance operations in the northwest province of Siem Reap . 
authorities have said they were then taken to Anlong Veng , though the Khmer Rouge has consistently denied involvement in the attack .
