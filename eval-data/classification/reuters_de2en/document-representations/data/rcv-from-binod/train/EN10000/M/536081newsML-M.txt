1400 GMT -- Norwegian bond yields were virtually unchanged but trade was picking up with investors showing interest in the long end , dealers said . 
falling interest rates were seen as a contributing factor . 
the crown continued to firm steadily after depreciating rapidly last week . 
Norway &apos;s central bank said it sold 549 million crowns between Wednesday and Friday last week . 
the bank said that to date this year it had sold a net 38.872 billion crowns . 
the bank announced in February it would resume purchases of foreign currency in order to manage the state &apos;s Petroleum Fund , which is where the government budget surplus is placed . 
it had stopped selling crowns in January after massive intervention on the foreign exchange market failed to halt a surge in the petrocurrency . 
at 1400 GMT , the crown had firmed to 4.1085 against the mark from 4.1140 at the same time on Wednesday . 
the crown was quoted at 100.70 against the inverse ECU index , a European basket of currencies , a bit stronger than the 101.77 reading on Wednesday .
