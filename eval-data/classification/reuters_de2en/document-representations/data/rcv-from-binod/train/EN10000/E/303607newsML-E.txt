British factory and raw materials prices were subdued in December , the Office for National Statistics said Monday , suggesting inflation pressures remain weak . 
the statistics office said oprices reflecting the cost of goods leaving factory gates were up 0.5 percent in December from November , giving a year-on-year increase of 1.7 percent . 
however , the seasonally adjusted underlying rate was a modest 0.1 percent , giving an annual increase of 0.8 percent , the lowest annual increase in core output prices in 30 years . 
the costs of raw materials and fuel fell a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent in December and were down 5.9 percent from a year earlier . 
&quot; Overall , these data provide further confirmation that pipeline inflation pressures remain extremely weak , &quot; said Jonathan Loynes , an economist at HSBC Markets . 
&quot; coupled with last week &apos;s softer than expected data on manufacturing output and Christmas retail sales , the figures ease the pressure for a rise in interest rates after Wednesday &apos;s monetary meeting . 
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke , the finance minister , meets central bank Governor Eddie George Wednesday for their monthly meeting on monetary policy . 
the Bank has been pressing for a rise in official interest rates from 6.0 percent because it believes inflationary pressures are mounting . 
but the Conservative government , which faces a general election by May at the latest , would prefer to avoid raising rates because this would mean costlier home loans for millions of Britons .
