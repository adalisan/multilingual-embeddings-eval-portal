the dollar closed barely changed here , capped by U.S. asset market weakness after stronger-than-expected retail sales data reignited interest rate rise fever . 
retail sales rose 0.8 percent in February , against average expectations for a 0.6 percent rise . 
January sales data was revised sharply upwards to an increase of 1.5 percent , compared with 0.6 percent previously . 
&quot; These data greatly increase the likelihood of first quarter GDP of four percent and as such , must be seen as increasing the likelihood of a Fed tightening , &quot; said Jeremy Hawkins , senior economic advisor at Bank of America in London . 
in addition to firm consumer demand , weekly jobless claims unexpectedly fell 5,000 to 307,000 . 
however , ex-auto sales , retail sales were below expectations . 
expectations that Friday &apos;s February producer price data will show benign inflation pressure also helped to cap the dollar . 
&quot; Today &apos;s data prompted a bit of a short-squeeze on the dollar but it &apos;s quite likely to stay rangebound if some of the strength of today &apos;s data will be offset by a mild PPI tomorrow , &quot; said a trader at a Swiss bank here . 
at 1620 GMT the dollar was at 1.7010 / 20 marks and 122.65 / 75 yen against 1.7002 / 12 and 122.55 / 65 in late European trading on Wednesday . 
despite the recent pullback the dollar outlook remains positive , given favourable yield differentials with Japan and Germany , analysts said . 
the mark and Swiss franc were firm on their crosses , which also helped to cap the dollar . 
but traders said Swiss franc strength was related more to an adjustment of capital flows rather than any fresh view of Swiss interest rates or the economy . 
paring of high-yield positions tends to lift the currencies in which they were funded . 
the Swiss franc , with the lowest rates in Europe , had been a favourite funding vehicle for those high-yield trades . 
comments by Swiss National Bank economist Georg Rich who said the franc &apos;s exchange rate was acceptable , also supported the franc &apos;s current rally , traders said . 
the Swiss franc rose to 85.76 / 79 against the mark at the close from 86.14 / 15 in late Europe on Thursday . 
dollar / Swiss was at 1.4585 / 95 against 1.4646 / 56 .
