Charlene Barshefsky is known as a tough negotiator who has gone to the brink of trade wars with Japan and China to secure agreements . 
the 47-year old acting U.S. Trade Representative was nominated on Friday by President Bill Clinton to assume that role on a permanent basis . 
Barskefsky was deputy to her predecessor , Mickey Kantor , for three years before she replaced him in April , when he left the trade office to head the Commerce Department . 
in nominating Barshefsky , Clinton described her as &quot; tough and determined . 
Barshefsky was not in Washington to personally hear those words , but in Asia doing just that -- striking hard bargains to open markets for U.S. products including a deal at a meeting of trade ministers in Singapore to eliminate tariffs on computer technology . 
another highlight of her tenure as acting head of trade office was the conclusion earlier this year of an agreement with China on intellectual property rights . 
although Barshefsky is widely admired for her negotiating skills , she lacks the political ties to Clinton that Kantor enjoyed and is said to be uncomfortable lobbying the political operatives at the White House . 
&quot; She is easily the most qualified , most knowledgeable person on trade law ever nominated to this post , &quot; said Gary Hufbauer , senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics . 
&quot; She &apos;s done very well . 
I don &apos;t think anybody could have done any better than she did in this ambiguous position ( of acting Trade Representative ) , &quot; he added . 
but Barshefsky could face tough questioning from the Senate , which must confirm her nomination . 
under a 1995 law , anyone who previously represented a foreign government in a trade dispute with the United States is prohibited from occupying the Trade Representative &apos;s post . 
while at the Washington law firm of Steptoe and Johnson , Barshefsky represented the Canadian lumber industry in a dispute with the United States . 
&quot; By the letter of the law it could be a problem , &quot; said analyst Thea Lee of the Economic Policy Institute think tank . 
but the White House has worked hard behind the scenes to smooth over the issue , and Lee said it was unlikely to disqualify Barshefsky because of her popularity with both Democrats and Republicans . 
Barshefsky holds a bachelor &apos;s degree from the University of Wisconsin and a law degree from Catholic University . 
she lives in Washington with her husband and two daughters .
