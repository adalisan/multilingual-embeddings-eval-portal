Bangladesh said a deadline for repatriating 7,000 Burmese refugees who refuse to leave fearing persecution at home expired on Friday . 
the repatriation process came to a halt on July 21 after violence by refugees refusing to return home left about 20 people injured , including six policemen . 
&quot; We have missed the August 15 deadline set by Rangoon for repatriating 7,000 refugees cleared by Burmese immigration , &quot; one government official said . 
the restive inmates in the Nayapara refugee camp , housing more than 12,000 refugees known as Rohingyas , have also refused food rations provided by Bangladesh . 
some 8,000 Rohingyas living in a second camp at Kutupalong are taking rations although they also demand to stay in Bangladesh indefinitely alleging military persecution at home . 
the refugees claimed some 25 young and elderly inmates at Nayapara had died since July 21 due to starvation and lack of medical care . 
the reported deaths could not be independently confirmed . 
&quot; We are still at square one , &quot; one official told Reuters in Chittagong on Friday . 
&quot; They ( refugees ) still refused to budge . 
the Nayapara refugees put up signboards at the camp gate highlighting their plight and protesting alleged &quot; forcible repatriation &quot; from Bangladesh , witnesses said . 
Bangladeshi officials said Burma had been expected to clear the remaining 21,000 refugees if the 7,000 had been sent back by the deadline . 
&quot; Now we will request them ( Burma ) to extend the deadline but we don &apos;t know what would be the outcome , &quot; one official said . 
all but 21,000 of 250,000 Rohingyas who fled from west Burma &apos;s Arakan state had been repatriated by April . 
but the process stopped after the Rohingyas and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) complained of forcible deportation . 
Bangladesh denied the allegations and said most of the Rohingyas were economic refugees .
