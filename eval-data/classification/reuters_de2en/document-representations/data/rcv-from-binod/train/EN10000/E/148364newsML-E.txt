Israeli exporters voiced disappointment at the 0.3 percentage point cut in interest rates announced on Monday and called for immediate measures to further lower rates and depreciate the shekel . 
&quot; The Bank of Israel &apos;s measure was a step in the wrong direction , &quot; said Amir Hayek , director-general of the Israel Export Institute . 
the Bank of Israel lowered its key lending rate for November to an annualised 15.2 percent . 
the shekel strengthened on news of the slight interest rate cut , rising to 3.25 shekels to the dollar from 3.28 . 
exporters said interest rates were still too high , which had led to an overvalued shekel . 
Amir Makov , chairman of the export institute , said exporters had been hurt by the shekel &apos;s exchange rate over the past three years . 
&quot; This ( the rate cut ) was a big disappointment for exporters , &quot; Makov said . 
while government ministers have hinted at a broad economic programme that would include interest rate cuts accompanied by fiscal tightening , Makov said : 
&quot; We can &apos;t wait for a comprehensive package . 
we need monetary action now . 
we need monetary steps to lower interest rates and correct the foreign exchange rate without waiting for fiscal steps .
