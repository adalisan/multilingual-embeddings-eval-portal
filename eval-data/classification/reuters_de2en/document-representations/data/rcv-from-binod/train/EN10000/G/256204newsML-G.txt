France was under intense pressure on Friday to lift its threat of a veto against Kofi Annan of Ghana in the contest for U.N. secretary-general after he obtained the backing of all other Security Council members in an unofficial poll . 
on Thursday the vote of 14-1 in the unofficial poll showed Annan , undersecretary-general in charge of U.N. peacekeeping , enjoyed the same degree of support obtained by his boss , Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , in a formal council vote on Nov . 19 . 
the Egyptian diplomat was the only candidate then but was vetoed by the United States . 
Boutros-Ghali later suspended his candidacy and four other African hopefuls , including Annan , entered the race . 
the council &apos;s five permanent members -- the United States , Russia , Britain , China and France -- all have veto power . 
Annan has led on all seven rounds of informal balloting since Tuesday but also ran into a veto each time by France . 
Paris backed the Sorbonne-educated Boutros-Ghali and is angry at the United States for vetoing him . 
Washington insists the United Nations needs new leadership to carry out reforms and has threatened to veto Boutros-Ghali again if he re-enters the contest . 
with even Egypt &apos;s U.N. envoy , a council member , voting for Annan on the latest ballot , France was being pressed to line up with its other council colleagues . 
some diplomats said events might now move swiftly , as often happens at the United Nations after earlier procrastination . 
under this scenario , the council could hold another unofficial ballot and then move quickly to a formal vote . 
if Annan obtained unanimous support in the unofficial poll , the council would wish to make the result official as soon as possible , providing a nominee for endorsement by the 185-nation General Assembly . 
the Assembly is scheduled to adjourn next on Tuesday but could reconvene any time to appoint a successor to Boutros-Ghali , whose five-year term expires on Dec . 31 . 
if France continues to oppose Annan , some council members might still wish to proceed to a formal vote to test Paris &apos;s nerve when it came to casting an actual veto . 
most diplomats have largely discounted the three African candidates trailing Annan . 
his closest rival is Amara Essy , the foreign minister of the Ivory Coast and the 1994-95 U.N. General Assembly president . 
he received seven votes on Thursday , with two permanent members opposing him , the United States and Britain . 
the two other candidates , who have consistently fallen far short of the minimum of nine votes needed , are Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah , a former foreign minister of Mauritania and former U.N. envoy for Burundi ; and Hamid Algabid , a former prime minister of Niger and currently secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference . 
if Annan should still be blocked and no other credible African candidate appears , the council &apos;s next step could be to open the contest to candidates from other regions . 
Africa has been given priority up to now on grounds that if Boutros-Ghali is denied the second term usually accorded a secretary-general , he should be succeeded by another African . 
but opening the race to candidates from other continents would anger African members , who account for nearly a third of the U.N. membership . 
and , according to Annan &apos;s supporters , much of the anger would be directed at France .
