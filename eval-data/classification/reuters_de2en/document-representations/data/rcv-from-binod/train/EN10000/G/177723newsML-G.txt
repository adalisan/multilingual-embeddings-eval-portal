U.S. ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale said on Friday that he would soon retire from his post , ending a three-year tenure during which he played a key role in settling trade feuds and repairing frayed security ties . 
&quot; With the American presidential election behind us , I have advised the secretary of state that now seems to be an appropriate time to end my tour of duty in Japan , &quot; Mondale said in a statement issued by the U.S. embassy in Tokyo . 
&quot; As I prepare to depart Japan , I am encouraged by the strength and vitality of the U.S.-Japan relationship -- the most important on earth , &quot; he added . 
&quot; By working together , we greatly enhance the chances for prosperity , freedom and peace . 
the relationship is solid and productive . 
the world could not have better news . 
Mondale , a former vice president appointed to his post in 1993 , was an active player in the many trade disputes which jarred two-way ties during his term . 
among the most bitter feuds was one over car trade that took the two nations to the brink of a trade war in 1994 . 
he also helped to repair security ties frayed by the end of the Cold War era and jolted by resentment of the huge U.S. military presence on Japan &apos;s southern island of Okinawa after the 1995 rape of a Japanese schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen there . 
while keeping up the heat on Tokyo to open its markets wider , Mondale also helped the two allies find ways out of their trade friction impasses . 
&quot; Mondale was viewed as a skillful statesman , and widely respected , &quot; said John Neuffer , a political analyst at Mitsui Marine Research Institute . 
&quot; The Japanese were happy that he was here during these rather tense times , &quot; Neuffer said . 
&quot; He brought an elevated stature with him . 
people knew that he could pick up the phone and talk to Washington himself , which elevated his clout here . 
Mondale , 68 , was a senator from Minnesota for 12 years before he was elected vice president in 1976 with president Jimmy Carter . 
he and Carter were defeated in 1980 . 
in 1984 , Mondale ran as the Democratic presidential candidate and lost to president Ronald Reagan . 
Mondale said when he took his new job that his top goals were to help cut Japan &apos;s huge trade surplus with the United States and maintain the bilateral security agreement . 
helped largely by a strong yen , Tokyo &apos;s trade surplus with Washington has indeed fallen . 
in the six months from April to September , the surplus dropped about 24 percent to 1.56 trillion yen ( $ 13.9 billion ) . 
after a rocky period last year during which Okinawan anger over the huge U.S. military presence on their island flared , U.S.-Japan security ties also appear on firmer footing . 
at a summit in April , Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed that the two nations would draft a set of new military cooperation guidelines under the 1960 U.S.-Japan Security Treaty . 
they also unveiled a plan to cut back on U.S. military bases on Okinawa , although details remain to be worked out . 
Mondale -- on past occasions rumoured to be a candidate to replace Secretary of State Warren Christopher -- will return with his wife Joan to his native Minnesota in mid-December . 
he plans to resume the practice of law in Minneapolis . 
Kyodo news agency , quoting political analysts and sources in Washington , said possible candidates to succeed Mondale as envoy included former House of Representatives Speaker Thomas Foley , former Senator Richard Lugar and retiring Senator Sam Nunn .
