NWE high sulphur cracked fuel oil was firmer on Thursday in line with crude but the market remained well supplied with transatlantic barrels and inventories in the Ara region are high , traders said . 
high sulphur barges traded at $ 98 early , then were sold down to $ 95.50 and $ 96 fob Ara . 
February swaps rose to $ 99 but the physical market remained below these levels . 
two , and possibly three large Venezuelan cargoes were expected to arrive in the Ara region in the next couple of weeks , adding to stocks which are already up on week-ago and year-ago levels . 
high sulphur cargoes were firmer , with few signs interest from U.K. utilities . 
but these players were heard not ready to pay above $ 95 CIF NWE , while offers had risen to around $ 99 . 
low sulphur fuel oil was firmer too . 
two Scandinavian cargoes were available for mid to late February , while another large piece was thought to be on offer from the U.K. 
but buying was poor , after the sale of a U.K.-origin cargo to an end user at around $ 110.50 CIF U.K. A Scandinavian player was heard to have sold a 45,000 tonne vacuum gas oil cargo , loading in the early February , to a transatlantic buyer on Wednesday .
