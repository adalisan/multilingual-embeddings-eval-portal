Israel coach Shlomo Scharf said he is placing all his faith in striker Ronnen Harazi in the World Cup qualifier against Bulgaria on Wednesday . 
Harazi , out of international action for almost a year due to injury , is seen as Israel &apos;s only trustworthy marksman having scored 19 goals in 36 appearances for the national team . 
Bulgaria will host Israel in the group five match which could go a long way towards deciding who qualifies for the finals in France . 
Russia top the group with 14 points from six games with Wednesday &apos;s protagonists second and third . 
Israel , bidding to qualify for the finals for only the second time , have 13 points from seven games with Bulgaria a point back but with two games in hand . 
Scharf , a man who usually keeps his cards close to his chest until the last moment , announced well in advance of Wednesday &apos;s match that Harazi will be his most important player . 
Israel must win in order to have any chance of qualifying for the World Cup finals in France next year . 
Harazi , who has suffered a series of injuries , joined Salamanca , newly-promoted to the Spanish first division , on a three-year contract worth $ 1 million earlier this year . 
Scharf has omitted midfielder Itzik Zohar , who is reported to be on the verge of signing for English premier league club Crystal Palace . 
Scharf said he had left Zohar out of the squad , which leaves for Sofia on Sunday , because the player chose to travel to London to discuss his contract with Crystal Palace instead of joining the squad at day training camp in Tel Aviv . 
&quot; He didn &apos;t even bother to tell me of his plans , and in any case , he is not ready for the match , &quot; he said . 
defensive midfielder Yossi Abuksis of Betar Jerusalem has been drafted in Zohar &apos;s place , as has another Betar player , Alon Harazi ( no relation to Ronnen ) . 
other notable omissions from the squad are West Ham &apos;s Eyal Berkovic who is suspended after picking up a second yellow card in Israel &apos;s last match in the group , a 2-0 loss away to Russia , and Ronnie Rosenthal , who joined Watford earlier this week after a long spell on the bench with Tottenham Hotspur .
