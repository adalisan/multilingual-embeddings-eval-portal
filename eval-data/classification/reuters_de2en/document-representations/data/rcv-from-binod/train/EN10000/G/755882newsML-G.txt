a newly cloned version of hepatitis C virus will help researchers learn more about the disease that kills some 8,000 Americans each year , a U.S. government scientist said on Thursday . 
the cloned virus will &quot; enable scientists to better understand the factors and mechanisms that determine whether virus is cleared from the body or produces a chronic infection , &quot; Dr. Tony Fauci , director of the National Institute of allergy and infections Diseases ( NIAID ) said in a statement . 
in the United States , hepatitis C is most common among people who have used intravenous drugs and is transmitted through contact with infected blood , although there have been cases of sexual transmission .
