shares in Bre-X Minerals Ltd traded heavily on Wednesday as investors anxiously awaited a key report on the controversial Busang gold discovery . 
Bre-X was off 0.29 at 3.51 in midday turnover of 5.3 million shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange . 
speculation over what the Busang report might say pushed the stock higher on Tuesday . 
&quot; Everybody is reading a lot into the rumors . 
but really they are just rumors right now , &quot; a Canadian mining analyst said . 
Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd is still expected to deliver its findings to Bre-X either on Thursday or Friday . 
Bre-X has said the results would be released publicly before North American financial markets opened on Monday . 
Strathcona President Graham Farquharson said on Tuesday it was unlikely that his company &apos;s findings had been leaked . 
an Indonesian newspaper reported on Tuesday that leaked results of Strathcona &apos;s drill tests showed &quot; cheerful &quot; grades of gold . 
&quot; I still haven &apos;t seen the results myself -- the assays are still under way . 
so I have to doubt the claim , &quot; Farquharson said in report published in the Calgary Sun newspaper on Wednesday . 
&quot; To the best of my knowledge there &apos;ve been no leaks , &quot; Farquharson said . 
Strathcona said last week it would maintain tight security over the assaying of its core samples at laboratories in Canada , Indonesia and Australia . 
only one or two persons in management at each laboratory would have access to the final assays and the results would not be reported until all the lab work was finished . 
Rumors have swirled around Busang since the century &apos;s biggest gold find was cast into doubt on March 26 when partner Freeport-McMoRan copper and Gold Inc said its preliminary tests found &quot; insignificant &quot; amounts of gold . 
panic selling of Bre-X shares lopped almost C $ 3 billion or 80 percent from the company &apos;s stock market value last month .
