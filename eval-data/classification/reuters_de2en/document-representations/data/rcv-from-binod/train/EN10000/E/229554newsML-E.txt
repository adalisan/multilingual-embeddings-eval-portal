a tax reform commission headed by Finance Minister Theo Waigel plans to recommend a two percentage point rise in the value-added tax as part of its plan to simplify Germany &apos;s tax system , commission sources said . 
planned reductions in tax rates could depress government revenues by about 90 billion marks , but the government aims to claw back about 30 billion marks of that by raising VAT and another 30 billion by eliminating deductions and loopholes , the sources said after a closed weekend meeting of the commission . 
the commission is also considering reducing the corporate tax on retained earnings to 40 percent from 45 percent , and cutting the top rate on commercial income to 42 percent from 47 percent , but it would limit write-offs for depreciation and reserves , the Handelsblatt newspaper reported . 
the commission is scheduled to submit its proposals to Chancellor Helmut Kohl &apos;s cabinet on December 11 , but details have not yet been finalised . 
differences of opinion remain on how best to tax profits from the sale of assets such as stocks and real estate , the sources said . 
the top income tax rate will be cut to 35 or 40 percent from the current 53 percent , and the low rate to about 20 percent . 
Waigel said over the weekend the bulk of the proposals could not be implemented until 1999 for administrative reasons , but the government is under pressure to act sooner . 
main points of the draft proposal , as reported by Handelsblatt , are as follows : 
-- Basic deduction for employed persons to be reduced to 1,000 marks or 1,200 marks from the current 2,000 marks a year . 
-- commuting deduction to apply to all , not just those who drive their own cars , but at much lower rate of about 0.20 marks per kilometer , compared with current 0.70 marks . 
-- Unemployment benefit and other non-salary compensation to be fully subject to tax , though personal income-tax deduction would mean such income remains largely tax-free except in cases of taxpayers with other supplemental income . 
-- Tax exemptions for Sunday , holiday and night pay to be eliminated . 
-- Most tax exemptions for legal settlements and other extraordinary income to be eliminated . 
-- Most special depreciation allowances to be eliminated . 
-- East German special depreciation allowance to expire at end-1998 . 
-- Construction depreciation to be eliminated . 
-- Special exemption for owner-occupied homes to be retained . 
-- depreciation for movable assets to be reduced from the current 30 percent , possibly to 20 percent . 
-- Reduced leeway for additions to corporate reserves . 
-- Reduced tax exemptions for farming . 
-- exemptions for church tax and charitable donations to be retained . 
-- Capital losses , for example on rental properties , may still be deductible against other taxable revenues . 
-- Tax on interest income to be reformed , at lowest possible rate , which may also apply to life insurance benefits . 
-- deduction for savings to be reduced .
