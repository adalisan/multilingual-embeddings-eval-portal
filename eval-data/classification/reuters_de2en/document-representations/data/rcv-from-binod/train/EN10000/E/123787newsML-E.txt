Chile &apos;s Public Works Minister Ricardo Lagos said his government was seeking $ 4.5 billion in private investment in infrastructure over the next four years to complement public efforts . 
the Chilean government plans to modernize roads , airports and ports through a combination of public and private funds , Lagos said . 
&quot; Private money is essential but private money is not going to replace public money , &quot; he said , explaining that the state would retain a role in providing infrastructure in rural areas and along less-travelled routes . 
&quot; The public effort will continue but in addition now we are getting private money , &quot; he said . 
the government plans $ 6.0 billion in public insfrastructure investment over the next four year , he said . 
Lagos also said the Chilean government , which rejected bids for the sale of the electric utility Colbun , would probably need to clarify the situation of water rights involved with the utility to generate investor interest .
