Australia &apos;s top Treasury official on Monday painted an upbeat picture of the country &apos;s economic outlook , with accelerating growth , falling unemployment , and inflation under control . 
Treasury secretary Ted Evans told a parliamentary committee Treasury &apos;s inflation forecasts -- already low -- were conservative and inflation had fallen further than expected . 
Evans said economic growth would be stronger than last year and that official forecasts for low inflation were on the conservative side . 
Evans &apos; comments indicated a more bullish outlook than the Treasury &apos;s projections in the May 13 budget for the 1997 / 98 year to June 30 . 
asked why the Treasury had failed to project lower than expected inflation , Evans said : &quot; ... we were conservative in forecasting inflation . 
we didn &apos;t expect that it would come down quite as much . 
Treasury , in official budget papers for the 1997 / 98 year , forecast consumer price index ( CPI ) inflation of 1.25 percent in 1996 / 97 , falling to 1.0 percent in 1997 / 98 . 
but official data released last month showed CPI inflation of just 0.3 percent in 1996 / 97 . 
Evans also told the committee hearing on government finances that official data due out in two weeks would show economic growth accelerating in the June quarter from the corresponding quarter in 1996 . 
&quot; ... it does appear that the June quarter , like the March quarter , was also stronger than what was happening in calendar 1996 , &quot; he said . 
gross domestic product grew 0.1 percent in the June quarter last year , for an annual rate of 4.5 percent . 
annual growth was 2.4 percent in the March quarter this year . 
the government has forecast growth of 3.75 percent in fiscal 1997 / 98 , but Reserve Bank governor Ian Macfarlane said last week the economy could safely grow at least 4.5 percent annually over the next few years without triggering an inflation blowout . 
Evans said the main downside risk to growth projections was the farm industry , troubled by drought and falling commodity prices . 
&quot; We &apos;ve forecast four percent growth in the non-farm sector , which is the bulk of the economy and we &apos;ve got no change to that ... so we don &apos;t see any significant downside there beyind the uncertainties that always surround forecasts , &quot; Evans said . 
&quot; So the main development has been weather , and hence the farm sector . 
the weakening of the Australian dollar over the past few months had also consolidated the non-farm sector growth forecasts , he said . 
Evans said he expected unemployment to improve after being stuck around 8.5 percent for the past two years , possibly dipping below eight percent in 1998 . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see any reason why unemployment can &apos;t continue to fall below the around eight percent that we &apos;re forecasting for mid-next year , &quot; he said .
