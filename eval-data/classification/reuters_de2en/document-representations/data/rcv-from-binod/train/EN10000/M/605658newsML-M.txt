CME lumber futures drifted down from early gains and finished mixed in light trade . 
initial local short covering lacked followthrough and futures drifted down the remainder of the day on scattered commission house and commercial selling . 
expectations that demand for lumber would improve around the holiday failed to materialize as cash markets remained slow , they said . 
cash sources cited continued larger offerings of wood at generally lower prices . 
lumber closed off $ 1.60 per tbf to up $ 2.00 with July up $ 0.10 at $ 393.90 and September off $ 1.40 at $ 382.00 per tbf .
