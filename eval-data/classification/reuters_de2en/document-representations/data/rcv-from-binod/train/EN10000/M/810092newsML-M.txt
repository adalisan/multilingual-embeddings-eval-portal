figures in brackets compare against previous trading day &apos;s close 
new Zealand bank bill yields closed higher on Tuesday following a fresh slide in the New Zealand dollar . 
the kiwi had a topsy-turvy day trading , ending at US $ 0.6390 / 97 after trading a 0.6380-0.6428 range . 
the bill market was struggling to keep the Monetary Conditions Index within acceptable bounds following the Reserve Bank &apos;s warning on Monday and has been largely reduced to currency watching . 
it closed 100 below the bank &apos;s desired level for the quarter . 
a foreign exchange dealer said the kiwi market appeared to have gotten itself short after being positioned the opposite way on Monday and a slight bid tone at the close . 
&quot; It &apos;s bounced back and the market is now short . 
bond dealers were a little puzzled about why the long end was sold so strongly . 
the 11 / 06 bonds ended nine basis points higher at 7.15 percent . 
one dealer said there was hedging of fixed mortgages which accounted for some of the weakness . 
but he said it was a &quot; skinny and skittery market &quot; . 
another dealer said Real Estate figures showed there was still some inflation pressure coming through in the Auckland housing market . 
the Reserve Bank &apos;s Financial Markets manager David Archer was reported to have told a weekend conference that the bank was still concerned about Auckland house prices . 
a bond dealer said New Zealand &apos;s spreads to Australia had widened significantly . 
even a $ 100 million eurokiwi overnight appeared to have no positive impact . 
&quot; It was a poor performance , &quot; he said .
