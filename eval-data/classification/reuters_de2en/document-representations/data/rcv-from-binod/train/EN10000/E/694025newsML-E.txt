the Hong Kong government said on Friday its accounts for the financial year ended March 31 , 1997 , showed a surplus of HK $ 25.7 billion . 
total fiscal reserves amounted to HK $ 173.6 billion as of March 31 , it said in a statement . 
revenue was HK $ 6.1 billion higher and expenditure HK $ 4.5 billion lower than anticipated at the time of the revised estimate , it said . 
the government said in March it expected the 1996 / 97 surplus to be HK $ 15.1 billion , itself an upward revision of the original HK $ 1.6 billion estimate made last year . 
a government spokesman said the higher-than-expected revenue arose largely from receipts in Stamp Duty , reflecting the exceptionally high level of activity in both the stock and property markets during the financial year &apos;s final quarter . 
&quot; The average monthly receipts from Stamp Duty in the final quarter were more than 60 percent higher than those recorded in the first nine months of the year , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The underspending of two percent was spread across a wide range of items , &quot; he added .
