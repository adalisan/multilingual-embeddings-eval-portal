Australian Industrial Relations Minister Peter Reith on Monday warned against complacency on inflation and wages growth , despite recent encouraging signs . 
&quot; The latest inflation and average weekly earnings figures from the bureau of statistics are certainly encouraging and should be welcomed , although there remain no grounds for complacency on the inflation and wages front , &quot; Reith said . 
&quot; In particular , the enterprise bargaining data are yet to show any substantive sign of easing in wage outcomes from agreements , &quot; he said in a speech . 
official figures on enterprise bargaining -- private wage deals between workers and employers -- show an annual increase of 6.5 percent for the March quarter . 
new figures are expected next week . 
Australia &apos;s consumer price index inflation was 2.1 percent in the September quarter . 
treasurer Peter Costello said last week official interest rates could be cut further if wages growth and inflation could be restrained . 
the Reserve Bank cut official rates to 6.5 percent from 7.0 percent last week , the second cut since another 0.5 percentage point reduction in July . 
&quot; The overriding objectives of the government &apos;s economic policy are to improve Australia &apos;s living standards and to reduce Australia &apos;s totally unacceptable level of unemployment , particularly youth unemployment , which currently stands at an appalling 28 percent , &quot; Reith said in the speech prepared for delivery at the conference . 
the speech , delivered later , made no reference to inflation or wages .
