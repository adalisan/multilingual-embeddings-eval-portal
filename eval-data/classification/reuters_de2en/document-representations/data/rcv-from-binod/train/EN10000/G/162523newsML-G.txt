Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole arrived on Sunday in California , after a night of cross-country campaigning , to make his last attempt to capture the biggest electoral prize . 
in the midst of a final campaign marathon lasting until Election Day on Tuesday , Dole addressed night campaign rallies in Sioux Falls , South Dakota ; Grand junction , Colorado , and Las Vegas before making a pre-dawn landing in San Diego . 
&quot; We &apos;re going to go around the clock , &quot; Dole told a cheering crowd in the ballroom of the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas . 
&quot; We can feel the momentum building and it &apos;s building all across America . 
the final weekend of the campaign was billed as a &quot; non-stop &quot; 96-hour marathon across the country . 
but Dole managed to work in a six-hour break on Sunday in the California beach community of La Jolla to nap and clean up . 
dole &apos;s press secretary Nelson Warfield called the hotel stop &quot; basically a hygiene break . 
in the middle of his heroic national marathon , Bob Dole took a break to clean up with a shower and a shave , &quot; he said . 
&quot; As filthy as Bill Clinton &apos;s campaign has been , he might as well consider cleaning up too . 
dole and his wife Elizabeth then went to the First United Methodist Church in the Mission Valley section of San Diego . 
California , with 54 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency , is the largest prize of the contest and has been steadily pursued by Dole . 
but Dole continues to trail Clinton , who has made the state one of his top political priorities throughout his presidency . 
the Dole campaign touted , as an indication that victory in the state was in sight , a new poll by Lawrence Research of 400 voters showing Dole trailing Clinton by five percentage points in California . 
the margin of error was five points . 
California is the 12th state in Dole &apos;s campaign-ending marathon that began on Friday . 
dole , an underdog despite some gains in recent polls , is seeking to beat President Bill Clinton with a last-ditch burst of campaigning and a focus on allegations of ethical lapses in the Clinton administration . 
&quot; There have been a lot of ethical questions raised by the White House in the last two or three weeks , maybe the past three or four years , &quot; Dole said in Las Vegas . 
although Dole &apos;s voice at times showed signs of strain , he continued to campaign enthusiastically despite the hectic , sleep-depriving schedule . 
in between nighttime stops , Dole chatted with reporters on his campaign plane , and called his staff in Washington , at about 3 : 20 a.m. Eastern time ( 0820 GMT ) , to provide a word of encouragement as they , too , worked around the clock . 
&quot; You &apos;re young , you can handle it all right , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We &apos;re having a great time . 
we &apos;ve only got about 56 more hours to go . 
after California , Dole was to head on Monday to Arizona , New Mexico , Texas , Louisiana , Tennessee and Iowa . 
dole said he intends to finish his campaign on Tuesday in Independence , Missouri , the hometown of Harry Truman , who came from behind to win the 1948 presidential race . 
he will then cast his vote in his hometown of Russell , Kansas .
