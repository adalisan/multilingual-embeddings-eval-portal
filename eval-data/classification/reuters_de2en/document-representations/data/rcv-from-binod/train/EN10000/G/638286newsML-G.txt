India &apos;s year-on-year exports fell sharply in April government figures revealed , but analysts attributed the decline largely to temporary factors , including an 11-day truck strike . 
the Commerce Ministry reported on Wednesday that exports fell by 10.1 percent in April to $ 2.52 billion from $ 2.81 billion in the same month last year . 
the government said the truck owners &apos; strike had hobbled exports in April , the first month of the financial year . 
a strong rupee and confusion over changes in the government &apos;s trade policy also hampered foreign sales , analysts said . 
&quot; It is worrying but it will not be the trend , &quot; Bidisha Ganguly , an economist with securities firm W.I. 
Carr , told Reuters . 
&quot; The truckers &apos; strike definitely had a influence on the drop . 
about 2.2 million truck owners , protesting against a proposed service tax and higher insurance premiums , went on strike in early April , bringing trade to a virtual halt . 
exporters complained at the time that the strike delayed about $ 1 billion worth of exports , which are crucial to the growth of the Indian economy . 
&quot; The transporters &apos; strike which lasted more than a week is believed to have impacted adversely on export movements and shipments during April , &quot; the government said in a statement . 
it said exports of gems , jewellery and leather goods had yet to reach &quot; the expected momentum &quot; . 
&quot; The strengthening of the rupee against the dollar is also affecting exports , &quot; Ganguly said . 
exporters have also complained that the rupee , which has been trading in the range of 35.75-35.90 per U.S. dollar for the past nine months , is overvalued and affecting their competitiveness . 
the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has had to intervene regularly to stop the rupee from appreciating as foreign investors buy rupees with dollars . 
finance Minister P. Chidambaram , who said in mid-May he was against a stronger rupee because exporters would complain , told a news conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday that the rupee would be defended against speculators . 
&quot; We must liberalise trade . 
we must encourage more imports of capitalised goods , &quot; Chidambaram said . 
&quot; If industry picks up , then imports will pick up . 
imports in April stood at $ 3.03 billion , up 1.7 percent from $ 2.98 billion in the same month last year . 
oil imports dropped 12.2 percent in April to $ 677.95 million , down from $ 772.35 million in April 1996 . 
&quot; Clearly , there has been some management of oil imports . 
also , international oil prices have come down , &quot; Charan Wadhwa , an analyst at the Centre for Policy Research , told Reuters . 
non-oil imports in April grew 6.62 percent to $ 2.35 billion against $ 2.21 billion in the same month last year . 
&quot; This does show some recovery in industrial production , &quot; Wadhwa said . 
industrial output grew 7.5 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 / 97 ( April-March ) compared with an 11.7 percent rise in the corresponding period in the previous year .
