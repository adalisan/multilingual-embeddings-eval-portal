the Bangladesh government and Shanti Bahini tribal rebels fighting for self-rule in the Chittagong Hill Tracts will hold their first meeting in Dhaka on Saturday , with hopes for a peaceful settlement running high . 
&quot; We are expecting good progress in the peace talks , &quot; one official , who declined to be identified , said on Friday . 
&quot; That the Shanti Bahini has agreed to send its leaders to Dhaka for a dialogue itself is an encouraging sign . 
the ice has started melting and we expect a quick end to the 23-year-old insurgency , &quot; he said . 
previous meetings between the two sides have taken place in the hill town of Khagrachhari . 
the Shanti Bahini ( Peace Force ) has fought a bush war for autonomy in the 5,500 sq miles ( 14,200 sq km ) of Hill Tracts , bordering India and Burma , since 1973 . 
they also want 300,000 Bengali-speaking settlers expelled from the area . 
officials say more than 8,500 rebels , soldiers and civilians have been killed in the insurgency , which has forced some 50,000 tribespeople to seek refuge in the northeast Indian state of Tripura . 
official sources said on Friday that the government , at the request of the rebels , was keeping the meeting venue a secret . 
&quot; They ( rebels ) want their leaders heavily protected . 
we have to listen to their security propositions , &quot; one said . 
Jyotirindra Budhipriya Larma , head of the Shanti Bahini &apos;s political wing , will head the five or 10-member rebel team at the talks . 
Abul Hasanat Abdullah , a senior official in the ruling Awami League , will lead the government side , by officials told reporters . 
the rebel team will fly to Dhaka by military helicopter from Dudukchhari , a Hill Tracts village near the Indian border . 
they would fly back to Dudukchhari after the talks , one official said , without indicating how long the meeting might last . 
&quot; It may be a one-day affair or spread over several days . 
it all depends on the progress of the talks . 
sources close to the meeting said on Friday Bangladesh might accept the Shanti Bahini &apos;s demand for a gradual withdrawal of government troops from the Hill Tracts , but not the demand to expel settlers . 
&quot; We will try to convince ( the rebels ) that they would be given full social and cultural rights , but they must live together with Bengalis moved into the Hill Tracts under government plans , &quot; one source said . 
&quot; The rebels should also promise to stop using guns , scaring away tribespeople and trying to provoke anti-government sentiment . 
the sources noted that suspected Shanti Bahini gunmen had killed two prominent tribal peace promoters , Subinoy Chakma and Adi Shankar Khisa , in the past month in attacks that political analysts said were an attempt to derail the peace talks .
