U.S. municipal bond prices were pegged from flat to slightly higher in early trade on Friday , aided by slight gains achieved by Treasury bonds , but dealings were subdued ahead of the weekend . 
&quot; It &apos;s nothing to brag about but it &apos;s a little bit better , &quot; a trader said . 
a few high-profile bonds , like the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority &apos;s mid-week sale of $ 383 million of bonds , were slightly firmer in the secondary market , up one basis point in 2017 , for example . 
however , Fridays often are quiet in tax-exempt markets and today was not expected to be an exception , as there were none if any bid-wanted lists being advertized . 
&quot; It &apos;s painfully inactive , and will probably remain so the rest of the day , &quot; another trader said . 
the market had only a fairly light series of economic reports to look ahead to next week , with the release of the Federal Budget expected on April 21 , March import and export prices on April 22 , and help wanted advertizements on April 24 . 
Treasury traders said hopes of a federal budget accord were helping to prop up prices . 
next week &apos;s supply of new issues was expected to total around $ 3.2 billion--almost $ 1 billion above this week--according to preliminary estimates compiled by the Reuters Municipal Bond Information Group . 
there were 63 competitive sales , which totaled around $ 578.3 million , with the largest a nearly $ 44 million General Obligation ( GO ) bond sale by Norfolk , Virginia , on April 23 . 
one day earlier , Evanston , Illinois , was scheduled to sell almost $ 36 million of GO bonds , while Oshkosh , Wisconsin , was slated to offer just under $ 32 million of revenue bonds . 
negotiated offerings added up to $ 2.6 billion , divided among 26 issues . 
leading the list was a $ 920 million sale by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , followed by a $ 543 million offering by the Municipal Assistance Corp of New York , and a $ 500 million sale of GOS for Chicago &apos;s schools . 
in debt futures , June Treasury bonds rose eight ticks to 108-3 / 32 , while June municipal bonds rose six ticks to 112-26 / 32 . 
in the secondary market , Texas State Turnpike Authority Dallas North Thruway revenues of January 2025 , which pay a five percent coupon , were bid at 5.85 percent , net , unchanged . 
and Sikeston , Missouri , Electricity Revenue Refundings of June 2022 , which pay a five percent coupon , were offered at 5.82 basis percent , net , down one basis point .
