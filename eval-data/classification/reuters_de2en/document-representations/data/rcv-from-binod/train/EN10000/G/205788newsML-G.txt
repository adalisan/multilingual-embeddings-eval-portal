if oddsmakers were to look into a crystal ball for a favourite for the Olympic women &apos;s giant slalom in 2002 , Italy &apos;s Sabina Panzanini would be a logical candidate . 
after winning a World Cup in that event Thursday , her confidence on the course that will be used in the Salt Lake City Winter Games knows no bounds . 
Panzanini , 24 , has raced here twice . 
she was runnerup in 1994 and now , on a day when 50-degree farenheit ( 10 C ) temperatures made snow condiditons difficult , she claimed first place . 
Panzanini &apos;s victory , fashioned chiefly with a strong first run , came with a total time of 2 : 38.50 . 
Austrian veteran Anita Wachter was second in 2 : 39.12 and Katja Seizinger of Germany third in 2 : 39.31 . 
Spela Pretnar of Slovenia took fourth and Martina Ertl of Germany fifth , reflecting the general good fortune of early starters in the second run . 
Seizinger , the defending World Cup overall champion , used the result to maintain her lead in her title defence after two giant slalom races . 
Seizinger has a 160-100 lead over Panzanini . 
&quot; I would love to be here in 2002 if my form is still good , &quot; Panzanini said . 
&quot; Obviously , this is the course for me . 
Panzanini , whose only other victory came two years ago on a similarly difficult tract at alta Badia , Italy , primarily used for men &apos;s races , made it plain she prefers a challenge . 
&quot; Too often our races are on straight courses without difficult turns . 
I prefer demanding turns , to be aggressive and fight my way through . 
on a day when softening snow added to the challenge , Panzanini &apos;s Italian teammate Deborah Compagnoni , reigning World Champion , was a casualty of the first run , as was the World silver medalist , Karin Roten of Switzerland . 
&quot; If Deborah did not go off course , I believe she would have won the race . 
she is the strongest in the world at this event . 
Panzanini also mentioned the overall strength of the Italian team , perhaps a result of a new coach , Georgio D &apos;Urbano , formerly trainer of Alberto Tomba . 
&quot; This proves we have good training and are ready for the season , &quot; Panzanini said of a result that placed three Italians in the top nine . 
with a first and third in the first two giant slalom races , Seizinger might argue that she now is dominant in a discipline that she considers only her third best behind downhhill and super G. Instead , she says she is having too much fun to be overly concerned about anything . 
now I have won all the championships and all the titles . 
no one can ever say I did not win this or that . 
while Seizinger seems almost diffident in defence of her overall title , such is not the case with Wachter , who has struggled since she won in 1993 . 
the Park City programme continues Friday with a men &apos;s giant slalom . 
women &apos;s slalom on Saturday and men &apos;s slalom Sunday complete the programme .
