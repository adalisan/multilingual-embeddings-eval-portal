the United States said on Monday it strongly regretted Albania &apos;s imposition of emergency measures and a vote by the Balkan country &apos;s parliament to re-elect President Sali Berisha . 
Albania &apos;s beleaguered government issued orders to shoot armed rioters on sight , imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew and curbed press freedoms on Monday in an effort to smother violent unrest sweeping Europe &apos;s poorest country . 
&quot; We strongly regret the measures taken by the parliament and government today to , in effect , introduce a state of emergency and to introduce censorship of the Albanian press , &quot; said State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns . 
&quot; We &apos;re very concerned that the state of emergency declared by the parliament today is being used to stifle legitimate free expression , &quot; Burns told a news briefing . 
burns also sharply criticised the election of Berisha on Monday to a second five-year term . 
&quot; We regret very much that today , under these difficult circumstances , the Albanian parliament went forward with the re-election of President Berisha , &quot; he said . 
&quot; This step is likely to increase polarisation rather than facilitate a solution . 
the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe also issued a statement criticising developments in Albania and calling upon Berisha to &quot; adhere strictly to the rule of law . 
&quot; Doing otherwise will lead to gross violations of human rights , damage Albania &apos;s prospects for democratic and free market reform , and cost Albania vital international support , with lasting negative consequences for Albania and its people , &quot; Commission Chairman Sen. Alfonse D &apos;Amato and Co-Chairman Representative Christopher Smith said . 
weeks of unrest in Albania sparked by the collapse of pyramid investment schemes climaxed at the weekend when at least 12 people were killed after crowds in several southern towns raided weapons depots and went on a rampage of burning and looting . 
calling it a &quot; critical moment &quot; in Albania , Burns said Washington was deeply concerned by the deteriorating situation and had urged Berisha , his government and all political leaders to work together to resolve the crisis . 
U.S. ambassador Marisa Lino had tried to bring the government and opposition together to discuss their problems , &quot; but to no avail , &quot; he said . 
Washington originally supported Berisha , who took power in the formerly Stalinist state in 1992 . 
but it became disillusioned with him after parliamentary elections last year that were widely criticised for fraud . 
U.S. government radio broadcasts to the country were cut off on Sunday , the Voice of America said in a statement , adding that it responded by stepping up its medium wave ( AM ) broadcasts to the crisis-ridden Balkan nation . 
its broadcasts through local FM stations in the capital Tirana and four other cities were stopped by the Albanian government .
