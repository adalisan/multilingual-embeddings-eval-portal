Sri Lanka &apos;s separatist Tamil rebels on Tuesday accused the U.N. refugee agency of turning a blind eye to Tamil refugees , swollen in number by a recent military offensive . 
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) said in a statement faxed to Reuters that staff of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) had done little to stop the refugee flow . 
the LTTE , fighting for a homeland for minority Tamils in this predominantly Sinhalese Indian Ocean island , claimed the government was blocking passage of relief , even temporary shelter , to families made homeless by the offensive . 
&quot; Despite this , the UNHCR has not yet made any meaningful steps to press Sri Lanka into easing its embargo to refugee areas . 
the inactivity of the UNHCR over the past two years has been astounding , &quot; the statement added . 
UNHCR &apos;s representative in Colombo , Peter Meijer , declined to comment on the rebels &apos; accusation . 
he said he had not seen their statement . 
the rebel statement said the offensive , completed last week after the military captured a key highway linking two northern towns , had created more than 17,500 refugees . 
&quot; Operation ( codenamed ) Edibala proceeded with large-scale shelling of surrounding villages causing the flight of thousands of families to refugee camps , &quot; the statement said . 
government troops , on the year &apos;s biggest offensive against the rebels , captured the highway linking Vavuniya , a government stronghold 220 km ( 140 miles ) northeast of Colombo , with Mannar , an army-controlled coastal town 240 km ( 150 miles ) north of the capital . 
Meijer said about 10,000 people had fled their homes ahead of the army advance and were at a relief centre at Madhu , 40 km ( 25 miles ) west of Vavuniya . 
&quot; This centre already had about 7,000 displaced persons from earlier offensives . 
so there are about 17,000 displaced people there at the moment , &quot; Meijer said . 
&quot; I understand there is enough food for the people at the camp . 
everything at the moment is under control , &quot; he said . 
the camp also had enough medicine , Guillermo Bertoletti of the French aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres ( MSF ) told the independent Island newspaper . 
a Defence Ministry spokesman said there were no large-scale firefights in the offensive and hence no reason for civilians to flee . 
the ministry said only five rebels were killed in the offensive , which was launched in two phases . 
there were no civilian or army casualties reported . 
the government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war , now in its 14th year . 
the LTTE says the toll is higher with the majority of the victims being Tamils .
