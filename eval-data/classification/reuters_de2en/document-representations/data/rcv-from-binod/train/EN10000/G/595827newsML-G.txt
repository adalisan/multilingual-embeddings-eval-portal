Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt predicted on Monday there would be a reservation system as early as next year to get into the country &apos;s national parks , to combat overcrowding . 
&quot; In the next two , three , four years we &apos;re going to need to implement a reservation system , &quot; Babbitt said in an interview from Yosemite National Park on NBC &apos;s &quot; Today &quot; show . 
&quot; Because otherwise you drive all the way up here and you find it &apos;s closed ( due to overcrowding ) . 
that makes no sense . 
so I would say next year this time it &apos;s pretty likely there &apos;ll be a reservation system . 
an estimated four million people annually visit California &apos;s Yosemite , which was closed 11 times in 1995 because of overcrowding . 
but Babbitt said the problem was not too many people but too many cars , and he said he would like to see a mass transit system as one way of alleviating the congestion . 
&quot; The problem &apos;s not too many people . 
the problem &apos;s too many cars . 
the plan for Yosemite specifically is to see if we can &apos;t rebuild this park in a way that encourages most of those four million people to get out of their cars ... and ride on buses , &quot; Babbitt said . 
&quot; They &apos;ll have a much better experience and we &apos;ll be able to have more people and not have to shut the place down . 
this park , on the Fourth of July and Memorial Day , can look and sound like Times Square . 
it &apos;s a mess .
