the dollar was easier against the yen at midday Tokyo on Tuesday on selling interest from U.S. funds , but was steady on the mark in directionless trade . 
traders said they were focusing on the announcement of the Bundesbank &apos;s money market operation later in the day as a means to figure out its intention on currency and monetary policies , although many see Buba adopting fixed interest rates . 
dealers said adopting variable rates could raise speculation the Bundesbank would raise money rates to prevent the mark from weakening further and keep inflation in check . 
but a senior trader at a European bank said guiding money rates higher would be inconsistent with policies that the Buba has taken . 
a higher German rate and the reversal of a weak mark trend would wreck the single European currency , he said . 
&quot; If Buba adopts variable rates , that could send the dollar sharply down by two pfennigs , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But careful watch is also needed because there is a chance that it may lower money rates through variable rates , &quot; he added . 
the Bundesbank is expected to make an announcement sometime after 0700 GMT on whether it will adopt fixed or variable rates in its weekly money market operation . 
if the Buba decides to float money market rates , the rate will be announced on Wednesday . 
before adjourning in July for its four-week summer recess , the Bundesbank fanned speculation that it might allow its fixed repo rate to float to stem the mark &apos;s steady decline . 
dealers said the dollar &apos;s topside was capped at around 1.8680 marks during the morning trade due to talk of selling interest by German corporations and European central banks . 
the dollar rose against the yen in early trade partly on relief that the U.S. financial markets had stabilised after Friday &apos;s losses . 
Stop-loss dollar buying at around 116.30 yen also helped firm the dollar . 
although further stop-loss sales orders were seen in place at around 116.50 yen , U.S. funds sold dollars and pushed it back below 116 yen , dealers said . 
there is also talk that a major New York-based hedge fund is placing offers at around 116.30 yen . 
&quot; The Japanese are still intent on buying dollars on dips , but overseas players are trying to sell on rises , &quot; said a bank dealer . 
Japanese operators , including trust banks , life insurers and importers bought an estimated three billion dollars on Monday in Tokyo , said the bank trader . 
some traders expect further bids by Japanese operators to support the dollar at around 115.50 yen , he added . 
the dollar closed at 116.10 / 15 yen and 1.8625 / 35 marks in New York on Monday .
