Ireland &apos;s finance minister Charlie McCreevy on Thursday welcomed an economic review of the Irish economy which forecast economic growth at 7.4 percent in 1997 and inflation at a moderate two percent on average . 
in an annual economic review and outlook , published on Thursday , the Department of Finance forecast gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth at 7.4 percent and gross national product ( GNP ) at 6.5 percent in 1997 . 
&quot; The projected maintenance of low inflation , the lower General Government Deficit now emerging , the further rise of 50,000 in employment forecast ... are particularly welcome , &quot; Finance Minister McCreevy said in a statement . 
he said the low inflation and general government deficit figures were &quot; especially important in the run-up to ( European ) economic and monetary union &quot; . 
the review expected employment to show an increase of more than 50,000 jobs in 1997 , while average unemployment was seen falling by 10,000 . 
consumer demand was expected to remain buoyant and consumer spending was expected to increase by 6.2 percent in 1997 . 
the review expected Ireland &apos;s general government deficit to undershoot its January Budget target , coming at around 0.7 percent of GDP , based on end-June Exchequer Returns . 
fixed investment was projected to grow strongly in 1997 , supported by high levels of business confidence , EU receipts , and continued low interest rates . 
exports were expected to strengthen in response to a recovery in export markets and increased capacity , particularly in the high technology sectors . 
the review said the current account of the balance of payments was expected to remain in surplus but warned that budget policy must not further add to inflationary pressures .
