prison authorities cancelled Colombian cocaine king Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela &apos;s hospital check-up this weekend after receiving a tip he was planning to escape , national TV reported on Sunday . 
the NTC news programme said a letter had been sent to the chief prosecutor &apos;s office , warning of the break-out bid being plotted by the jailed No . 
2 leader of the once-mighty Cali drug cartel and some of his former henchmen who are still on the run from justice . 
a spokesman at the prosecutor &apos;s office on Sunday was unable to confirm whether a letter had been received and if it had been forwarded to the National Prisons Institute ( INPEC ) . 
Miguel Rodriguez , like his imprisoned brother Gilberto , the former cartel chieftain , suffers from heart problems and undergoes regular examinations at one of Bogota &apos;s top hospitals . 
the latest hospital visit had been scheduled for Saturday , NTC said . 
the brothers were sentenced to jail terms 10 days ago that will in practice see them walk free in five years . 
an anonoymous judge slashed potential maximum sentences of 24 years after the drug lords admitted their role in heading a vast criminal empire , whose tentacles stretched across the globe , for more than 20 years . 
the terms caused uproar in Colombia and the United States . 
the chief prosecutor &apos;s office has appealed the sentences and evidence is emerging that the brothers admitted only a small part of their total criminal enterprise -- which could lead to a fresh trial and stiffer sentences for the undeclared crimes .
