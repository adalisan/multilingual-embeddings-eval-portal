the Hungarian stock market fell kicked off trading in the week with an over three percent fall , moving in the same direction as other markets in Europe . 
&quot; The market dropped in line with international trends , &quot; said Laszlo Baranyai of Daewoo Securities . 
&quot; I think the fall has not reached its end yet , &quot; he added . 
analysts said fears about the short-term global outlook , Hungary &apos;s current market valuation and the recent mixed batch of first half corporate earnings have shown a negative direction to the market . 
&quot; The market is inevitably being dragged down by Wall Street and general fears about the developed markets , &quot; Nigel Rendell , Emerging Markets strategist at HSBC James Capel in London said earlier . 
on Monday , the few stocks that bucked the bearish trend included Inter-Europa Bank , which added 1,000 forints to 52,000 , agricultural trading company Agrimpex which gained 2,500 forints to 23,500 , and machinery firm Mezogep , which edged up 80 to 4,400 . 
among the losers were pharmaceuticals Egis which dropped 750 forints to 10,250 and oil company MOL which fell 120 forints to end at 4,390 .
