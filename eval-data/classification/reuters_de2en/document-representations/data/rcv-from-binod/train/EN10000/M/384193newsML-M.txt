the mark shot up 10 lire as the Italian currency was plagued by continued worries about whether it would be able to join Europe &apos;s single currency in the first round . 
the lira &apos;s fall came after Belgian newspaper De Financieel Economische Tijd quoted Verplaetse as saying that EMU would best start without Italy as the country would not be able to meet EMU criteria . 
Verplaestse later denied his comments referred to Italy . 
all the same , the mark rose around one percent to 996.10 lire from the day &apos;s low of 985.65 . 
it was at 987.00 / 50 in late European trade on Monday . 
&quot; When we broke the 994 level , people started to see it ( the lira ) going over 1000 , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; The market &apos;s very nervous . 
the mark was buoyed against other currencies as the dollar shied away from the key 1.70 mark level . 
&quot; People are a bit nervous above 1.70 . 
people long up there are worried the Bundesbank could call a halt to it , &quot; said Pat Magill , head of the corporate desk at Daiwa Europe here . 
&quot; If they come in the market it could come down pretty quickly . 
the mark was further helped by heavy selling of sterling on receding expectations of a rate hike in Britain in the near future . 
dollar / mark slid to 1.6892 / 99 by 1633 GMT from its session high of 1.7050 and its late Monday level of 1.6988 / 93 , while sterling / mark fell to 2.7048 / 57 from an intraday high of 2.7535 and its Monday level of 2.7446 / 56 . 
mark / Paris was in a tight trading range , solid at 3.3760 / 64 compared with late Monday &apos;s 3.3734 / 44 . 
traders said the lira was further damaged by remarks from Italy &apos;s Communist Refoundation leader Fausto Bertinotti that he was totally opposed to a &quot; corrective mini-budget &quot; later this year , proposed by Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi . 
the mark &apos;s rise against the lira was briefly halted in early afternoon Europe by rumours that the Bank of Italy was asking prices around the ERM central rate of 990 lire per mark .
