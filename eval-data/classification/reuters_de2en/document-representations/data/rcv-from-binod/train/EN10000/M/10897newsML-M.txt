IPE gas oil closed unchanged on Friday , putting in a strong performance against Brent , which slipped on heavy U.S. selling and news that Mexico &apos;s crude export ports reopened after a two-day closure . 
Sept gas oil closed at $ 191.00 a tonne , leaving the Sept / Oct backwardation unchanged at 75 cents . 
OCT Brent had shed 10 cents to trade at $ 20.62 a barrel by 1638 GMT , having touched a low of $ 20.56 . 
the Oct Brent / gas oil crack spread widened to $ 4.75 a barrel . 
traders said Brent was tracking NYMEX crude which had lost the support of heating oil futures . 
U.S. brokers were seen selling crude in favour of heating oil , but U.S. products were weaker nevertheless . 
&quot; Products are not holding up well in the States , &quot; said one IPE floor broker . 
&quot; Heat is the strongest and that &apos;s still negative . 
Mexico &apos;s three crude export ports on the Gulf of Mexico , Cayo Arcas , Pajaritos and Dos Bocas reopened on Friday after a two-day closure because of the threat posed by Hurricane Dolly . 
the ports export an estimated 1.5 million barrels of crude daily .
