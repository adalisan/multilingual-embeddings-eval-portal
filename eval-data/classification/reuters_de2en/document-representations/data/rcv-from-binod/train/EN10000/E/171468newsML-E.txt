a year-on-year rise in Japan &apos;s trade surplus for the first 20 days of October was only a reaction to last year &apos;s rapid decline in exports , a Ministry of Finance official said on Wednesday . 
the ministry announced earlier that Japan &apos;s customs-cleared trade surplus for the first 20 days of October surged 22.1 percent from the same period a year earlier to 231.15 billion yen , the first such rise since August 1995 . 
&quot; The actual trade balance is close to the recent trend , &quot; the MOF official said , adding that the first year-on-year rise in 14 months was a reaction to the trade balance of October 1995 , when the trade surplus for the first 20 days of that month showed a hefty year-on-year decline of 57.6 percent . 
the MOF official also said it was difficult to forecast the trade balance for the entire month based only on the figures for the first 20 days . 
&quot; There are cases when the figures are skewed for the first half of the month due to various reasons , such as late shipments , &quot; the official said .
