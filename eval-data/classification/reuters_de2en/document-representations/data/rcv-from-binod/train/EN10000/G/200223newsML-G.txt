Austrian President Thomas Klestil , readmitted to hospital with a pulmonary embolism , is battling a chronic lung inflammation that could restrict his future activities , a top U.S. doctor said on Tuesday . 
baffled Austrian physicians called in Thomas Medsger , an expert in connective tissue disease from the University of Philadelphia , after Klestil struggled for breath during a television interview last Thursday . 
he was speaking in public for the first time since mid-September when he spent several days hooked up to an artificial respirator . 
&quot; It is too early to say whether the president will be able to return to all his official duties ... but I am optimistic , &quot; Medsger told Austrian radio . 
&quot; Many patients return to virtually normal physical activity after a bout of connective tissue disease , regardless of whether that inflammation affects the joints , the lungs , kidneys or some other location , &quot; he said . 
Medsger added that there was no evidence that Klestil &apos;s organs were affected by the disease , which is evident in his joints and lungs . 
he said the embolism , or blood clot on the lung which can be potentially fatal , was not linked with the long-standing inflammation . 
doctors at Vienna general hospital , where Klestil is being treated , did not set a date for his release . 
Klestil became president in 1992 and helped restore Austria &apos;s image abroad after his predecessor Kurt Waldheim &apos;s period in office was overshadowed by his Nazi past . 
Klestil briefly passed his responsibilities to Chancellor Franz Vranitzky in September after falling unconscious for three days , but he officially resumed his duties when he was released from hospital two weeks later .
