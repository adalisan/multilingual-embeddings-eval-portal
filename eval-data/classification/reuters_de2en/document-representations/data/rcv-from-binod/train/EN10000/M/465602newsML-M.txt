the IPE natural gas futures market saw a busier day on Tuesday as a total of 180 lots traded in 13 separate deals and prices were up across the board . 
of the total , 50 lots were done in June and 45 in September . 
&quot; There &apos;s talk of a June / Sep spread on the physical , so 95 lots are reflected in that , &quot; said a futures broker . 
&quot; There are not a lot of players in the market but volumes are improving , &quot; he added . 
there was some surprise that prices were up across the board , with many still predicting a gentle drift downwards , especially in the summer . 
&quot; In a more liquid market we might have tested 9.30 or 9.20 ( pence a therm ) , &quot; said a broker , referring to the April contract . 
April only traded once , a 5 lot deal at 9.55 pence . 
apart from the June and September contracts , activity centred on next winter , with 45 lots traded in January and 35 in February . 
January saw the biggest price rise , of 0.23 pence a therm to trade for the last time at 15.995 . 
but the market was bid and offered stronger in most periods , with closing bids as high as or higher than the previous day &apos;s settlement price in seven of the 12 monthly contracts .
