Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus quickly rejected a minister &apos;s suggestion on Friday that the current cabinet should resign and a new one be formed from the same coalition parties . 
the government has been facing growing public distrust as economic growth , the cornerstone of its policies , has slowed since the beginning of this year . 
industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy was quoted by a spokesman as saying : &quot; The resolution of the current situation could be the resignation of the cabinet and the creation of a new one within the current coalition . 
the spokesman for his party , the neo-liberal Civic Democratic Alliance , said the remarks represented &quot; at this point &quot; Dlouhy &apos;s private view , but added the party would debate the minister &apos;s idea soon . 
Klaus , whose Civic Democratic Party ( ODS ) is the senior partner in the three-party coalition , slapped down his minister &apos;s idea . 
&quot; If Dlouhy made a decision concerning himself ... he should not pass it to others , &quot; CTK news agency quoted him as saying . 
a worsening foreign trade balance , rapid erosion of the exchange rate of the crown and a rash of financial scandals has led to a loss of confidence from both Czech public and foreign investors . 
Dlouhy has said he is considering leaving the cabinet by the end of this year and other members of the cabinet have said the government could be restructured later this summer . 
Dlouhy and Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik of ODS have been under heavy fire for failing to regulate financial markets , keep the state budget in balance and curb the trade gap . 
opinion polls have shown a steady decline of confidence in the government , and a large drop in the ratings of the ODS , triggering debate within the party on replacing its leaders .
