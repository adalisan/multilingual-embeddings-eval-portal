Tuesday evening &apos;s weekly oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) is expected to show steady to minor increase in gasoline stock as an anticipated decline in demand will be offset somewhat by a fall in imports . 
a consensus of trader estimates anticipated a one million barrel build in gasoline stocks , while the estimate ranged from a decline of one million barrels to an increase of 2.5 million barrels . 
&quot; Given supplies are so low , gasoline is bound to be the focus of the report , &quot; said Jim Ritterbusch , trader with Sweeney Oil in Chicago of the data which reflects the week ended May 9 . 
last week &apos;s data which reflected the week ended May 2 said gasoline stocks were off 13.2 million barrels versus a year ago just three weeks before the U.S. Memorial Day weekend which is a popular driving period . 
implied demand for gasoline in last week &apos;s data was an all-time record 8.7 million barrels per day ( bpd ) . 
&quot; apparent gasoline demand was just too high last week , so we are bound to have some sort of correction in stocks to the upside this week , &quot; Ritterbusch said . 
the three week implied gasoline demand average stood at 8.4 million bpd , and William Brown , president of W.H. 
Brown &amp; Co in New York , noted it would almost be unheard of to get such strong implied demand four weeks in a row so early in the gasoline driving season . 
but , John saucer , analyst with Smith Barney in Houston , noted : &quot; Everyone expects gasoline demand to be lower , that &apos;s no surprise , but we are also going to have lower imports . 
gasoline imports were up 346,000 bpd last week . 
Ritterbusch noted the decrease in gasoline stocks , which has yielded the strong implied demand figures , have been fueled by liquidation of winter gasoline inventory to make room for summer grade . 
moreover , refiners have been moving stocks to their retail operations , draining primary stocks , dealers said . 
crude stocks were seen rising by 750,000 barrels with estimates ranging from up one to 2.5 million barrels . 
imports were expected to ease somewhat as Asian refineries absorb West Afrian crude now that the refineries are out of turnaround . 
as it stands , traders said crude imports are being readily absorbed in the U.S. , restraining a build in crude stocks , as refineries pump out gasoline to meet anticipated peak demand this summer . 
still , refinery runs were expected to decrease by a half percentage point after rising one percentage point in the May 2 week . 
expectations would still leave runs at a high 94 percent .
