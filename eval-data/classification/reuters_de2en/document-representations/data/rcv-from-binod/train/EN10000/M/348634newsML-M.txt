contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mostly down on Friday with most institutions unwilling to trade in the last session before the Chinese Lunar New Year , traders said . 
total turnover fell to 2.69 million lots from 2.75 million lots . 
one lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills . 
the most active three-day contract fell sharply to 3.98 percent from 37.4 percent on Thursday , probably due to the appraoch of the long annual holiday , one trader said . 
&quot; The holiday mood dominated the market , resulting in dull trade today , &quot; said another trader . 
&quot; The absence of new issues and listings on the A share markets also helped today &apos;s dive , &quot; he added . 
the repo rates were likely to go up after the two-week holiday as trading on the market by state-owned banks has been banned , traders said . 
contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mostly up with institutional support for better sentiment in the last session before the holiday , traders said .
