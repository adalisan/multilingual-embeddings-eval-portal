Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy vowed on Tuesday that Ottawa would do what it could to make sure Rwanda investigated the killing of a Canadian priest during Sunday mass . 
&quot; We have made a direct representation and we have received assurances that they will undertake an active investigation and prosecution , &quot; he told reporters after seeing the new U.N. secretary-general , Kofi Annan . 
&quot; We will continue to work actively with them to make sure that will happen , &quot; he said , adding that he intended to go to Africa in the spring &quot; to make our case known &quot; . 
Axworthy , who had met Annan previously while he was in charge of U.N. peacekeeping , also said he invited the secretary-general to visit Canada in the spring . 
father Guy Pinard , 61 , was gunned down as he was handing out communion at his parish church in Kampanga village , 12 miles ( 20 km ) north of the northwestern regional capital of Ruhengeri , Rwandan officials said . 
they speculated the killing was carried out by Hutus who returned late last year from Zaire or Tanzania and feared he would recognise and denounce them as killers during the three-month genocide of an estimated 800,000 people in 1994 . 
&quot; If there is to be a continued international presence then you have to provide some sense of confidence that people will not be randomly murdered like this , &quot; Axworthy said , referring to Pinard as well as four U.N. human rights workers killed in an ambush in Rwanda on Tuesday . 
&quot; Rwanda has been through traumatic times , &quot; the minister said . 
&quot; We are certainly not in any way letting this pass by . 
Pinard &apos;s death was first announced by Pope John Paul , who told pilgrims in St Peter &apos;s Square the Catholic priest had been &quot; barbarically assassinated &quot; while celebrating mass . 
he was from Trois Riveres in Quebec province and was a member of the White Fathers missionary order . 
on Tuesday , four U.N. human rights monitors -- a Briton , a Cambodian and two Rwandans -- were gunned down while visiting a commune in Karengera in the Cyangugu prefecture near the Zairean border . 
two weeks ago suspected Hutu militiamen killed three Spanish aid workers in the town of Ruhengeri and wounded an American in an attack on the compound where they lived .
