President Boris Yeltsin , in his first radio address to the Russian people since he fell ill with pneumonia , on Friday dismissed calls for constitutional changes to reduce his powers or oust him . 
the 66-year-old president , who is still recovering from the pneumonia that laid him low last month , spoke clearly but with a slightly croaky voice in the address , broadcast just before parliament debated a non-binding resolution on his health . 
deputies in the State Duma lower house approved a motion asking Yeltsin &apos;s doctors to report in writing by March 1 , but failed to muster support for a resolution asking him to quit . 
the Kremlin has indicated in the past that it sees no need to present a written report on Yeltsin &apos;s health . 
but only 208 deputies voted for a resolution from communist Viktor Ilyukhin that Yeltsin should quit because he was too ill to govern -- not enough to allow the resolution to be passed . 
&quot; We are told every day ... that Yeltsin &apos;s health is satisfactory , &quot; Ilyukhin told deputies . 
&quot; It is really satisfactory , for a pensioner , but not for the leader of the state . 
Yeltsin effectively does not rule the state . 
the country is dying , in a state of deepest crisis ... &quot; 
Yeltsin , who is slowly returning to the Kremlin after his illness , has tried to make his mark on Russia &apos;s political scene , but has looked stiff and Gaunt in television appearances . 
he said on Friday that constitutional changes should not be rushed . 
&quot; Amendments and additions can be made to ( the constitution ) but you should not rush this . 
it must be a natural process , &quot; Yeltsin said in a six-minute address . 
&quot; The constitution is the pivot of the new Russian statehood ... It is premature today to subject the new structure of the Russian state , as it is being built , to a test of its durability . 
it is more than that -- it is foolhardy . 
Yeltsin has had at least two heart attacks , he had heart surgery last November and spent 12 days in hospital with pneumonia last month . 
one of his doctors said on Wednesday he still needed at least 10 more days to recover fully . 
Yeltsin &apos;s poor health has increased concern about the nature of the constitution , drawn up to suit his demands for a dominant role and approved in a nationwide referendum in 1993 . 
Yeltsin had set aside the old constitution in September 1993 by exceeding his authority and dissolving the sitting parliament . 
when opponents used the legislature &apos;s White House headquarters to launch an armed uprising , Yeltsin used troops to crush resistance . 
the armed forces which so hesitantly backed Yeltsin in that month now face crisis . 
a non-government research organisation said on Friday the army faced a collapse that could lead to civil war or a military coup . 
&quot; The army has long ceased to be a guarantee against external threats , &quot; said a statement by the Council for Foreign and Defence Policy , published in the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta . 
&quot; The present state of the Russian army can be described only as a catastrophe ... which is growing into a national catastrophe . 
recent proposals for constitutional changes include allowing Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to serve as president until the end of Yeltsin &apos;s scheduled term if the president dies in office , reducing the president &apos;s powers , setting up a state council to govern or having the next president chosen by parliament . 
Yeltsin touched in his speech on two other major problems already dogging his four-year second term . 
he implicitly urged Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov , who was inaugurated in the rebel region on Wednesday , to concentrate on ensuring peace rather than pushing for secession -- an issue which prompted a nearly two-year conflict with Russian troops . 
he said Russia would work with Maskhadov and Chechnya , but added : &quot; There can be no one-sided decisions in our relations . 
&quot; I am counting on the head of the republic ... to direct all his efforts towards Chechnya &apos;s social and economic revival , strengthening inter-ethnic peace and accord , and unconditional defence of human rights and freedoms , irrespective of ethnic origin or religion . 
there simply is no other path . 
Yeltsin renewed pledges that the government would finally meet its obligations to pay all pensions . 
anger over its failure to pay them has caused widespread anger . 
Yeltsin did not mention a deepening row with NATO over the Western alliance &apos;s eastward expansion plans , opposed by Moscow , or a hostage crisis in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan , where rebels have seized Western and Russian hostages . 
but Interfax news agency quoted the presidential press service as saying Yeltsin was &quot; extremely alarmed &quot; at the situation and had urged Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov to &quot; do his utmost &quot; to free the captives .
