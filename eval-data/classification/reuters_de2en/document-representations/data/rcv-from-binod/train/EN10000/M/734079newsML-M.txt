three months copper is expected to probe the downside towards support at $ 2,250 and $ 2,230 a tonne , but a hefty backwardation should underpin the market , analysts and traders said on Wednesday . 
aluminium was soggy and should also test lower levels , they added . 
three month prices formed a bearish outside day on the charts on Tuesday , closing near their lows at $ 2,278 after touching a high of $ 2,337 , indicating further downside moves . 
support was pegged at $ 2,250 , the lows of July 10 and 11 , and $ 2,230 , the low of July 9 . 
in addition , the 200-day moving average at $ 2,261 should also help slow any move lower . 
but the cash / threes backwardation was still above $ 200 per tonne and should keep prices from spiralling out of control . 
it was slightly narrower early on Wednesday , indicated at $ 225 / $ 240 , compared to $ 240 / 50 at Tuesday &apos;s close . 
&quot; Look for further initial weakness , but with the spread remaining firm around $ 240 back , copper remains vulnerable to upside spikes , &quot; said analyst Martin Squires of broker Rudolf Wolff . 
resistance would be seen at the psychological $ 2,300 mark , then around $ 2,315 / 18 , at $ 2,337 , Tuesday &apos;s peak , and at $ 2,365 , the top of a gap . 
&quot; On the upside , a close above $ 2,302 is needed to relieve downward pressure and target $ 2,335 , &quot; said Harry creates , chartist with broker AMT . 
the market would explore lower levels after shedding $ 21 on Tuesday but support should kick in at the lower levels . 
&quot; A sloppy close indicates a test of the $ 1,555 / 60 area , &quot; said broker Brandeis in a commentary . 
&quot; reasonable scale-down buying should be seen at these levels , however , and unless there is a breach of support at $ 1,540 , the market is expected to remain in its recent range , &quot; Brandeis added . 
other analysts pegged support at $ 1,542- $ 1,545 based on the lows of April 14 , June 25 and July 9 , and at the February 11 low of $ 1,534 . 
on the upside , resistance would be seen around $ 1,585 , the top of the recent range before Tuesday &apos;s spike higher . 
at 0745 GMT three months aluminium was quoted at $ 1,551 / 54 , down $ 13 from Tuesday &apos;s late close .
