the Tanzanian army on Sunday drove an estimated 200,000 refugees from the largest refugee camp in Tanzania and herded them along the road to the nearby Rusomo border crossing into Rwanda . 
the Rwandan Hutu refugees told reporters soldiers entered Benaco camp around noon ( 0900 GMT ) and forced them out using sticks and batons . 
&quot; I didn &apos;t want to go but the soldiers said we must -- so what else could we do ? 
&quot; Jean-Marie Nundanutsa said . 
earlier , thousands of refugees who had bedded down in the open overnight , some cooking frugal meals over wood fires , resumed their trek towards Rusomo at dawn . 
they crossed in a steady stream , estimated by witnesses at 1,000 an hour . 
in hot sun , the refugees drove cattle , pushed cars and wheeled bicycles loaded with their possessions along the 17-km ( 10-mile ) road from Benaco camp to Rusomo . 
from Rusomo , an unbroken mass of refugees stretched back as far as the eye could see . 
officials at the remote border post west of Lake Victoria said about 9,000 refugees had crossed over during Saturday night . 
the border post , normally closed at night , remained open to allow the flow of refugees , the second major mass repatriation into Rwanda in five weeks , to continue . 
the exodus followed talks between camp leaders in Benaco and officials of the Tanzanian government , which says it wants all 540,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees in Tanzania out by December 31 . 
aid workers said most of the refugees arriving at the border on Sunday morning had come from camps south of Benaco . 
they had been shepherded past the Benaco camp by Tanzanian security forces , who told them to keep moving towards the border . 
&quot; Many people are walking in the right direction , &quot; said Anne Willem Bijleveld of the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR . 
Bijleveld said soldiers walked with refugees but &quot; in a humane manner &quot; and even assisted the needy . 
before the first column reached the border on Saturday , witnesses said hundreds of thousands were streaming towards Rusomo from as far away as Nyakahura , about 100 km ( 65 miles ) to the southeast . 
on the Rwandan side of the border , aid agencies set up water points , health posts and biscuit distribution sites along a 100-km ( 65-mile ) route from the frontier , and Rwandan president Pasteur Bizimungu visited the area to welcome the returning refugees , witnesses said . 
about 200,000 of the refugees originally came from villages within 30 km ( 18 miles ) of the Rusomo crossing and were expected to walk back to their former homes . 
U.N. aid officials said they believed a rush away from the border by hundreds of thousands of refugees on Thursday broke the grip of the Hutu intimidators who had ordered the refugees not to try to return to Rwanda . 
troops and police turned back refugees who had earlier headed inland into Tanzania from their camps , telling them instead to walk towards the Rwanda border . 
it was unclear whether any action was being taken by Tanzanian security forces to restrain the Hutu militiamen and former Rwandan troops , who fear to return because of involvement in the genocide of up to a million people in Rwanda in 1994 . 
in addition to more than 500,000 Rwandan refugees , there were 112,000 Burundian refugees in Tanzania . 
the latest migration was the second mass return of Rwandan refugees . 
more than 500,000 left Zaire in four days from November 15 after a rebellion by Zairean Tutsis broke the Hutu intimidators &apos; hold . 
the United Nations has ordered 350 Canadian servicemen and women , the basis of a multinational force destined for eastern Zaire , to pull out and return home from their bases in Uganda and Rwanda . 
the force , formed in mid-November , was rejected by the Zairean rebels who now control a large slice of eastern Zaire . 
it was unable to help Rwandan refugees in Zaire and also failed to win the support of other nations . 
African leaders including South Africa &apos;s President Nelson Mandela are due to meet in Nairobi on Monday to discuss efforts to control conflict in Zaire and the Great Lakes region of Central Africa .
