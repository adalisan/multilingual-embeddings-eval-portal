Sweden &apos;s central bank , the Riksbank , on Thursday said inflation was in line with forecasts made in June for an annual rate of inflation of about one percent in 1997 and two percent in 1998 . 
&quot; Developments do seem to be broadly in line with the assessment in the latest inflation report , &quot; the Riksbank said in a statement . 
the June quarterly inflation report said the underlying rate of inflation in 1997 and 1998 was estimated to be between 1.5-2.0 percent . 
Riksbank deputy governor Lars Heikensten said the situation appeared to be in line with this report . 
&quot; It &apos;s still too early for a detailed evalutions of all the information of importance for inflation in Sweden that has flowed in during the summer , &quot; Heikensten said . 
he said a positive feature was the stable situation in international demand . 
activity in Europe was turning upwards and the U.S. economy remained strong . 
&quot; There is also the prospect of persistently subdued inflation in the world around us , &quot; he said . 
Heikensten said activity in the Swedish economy picked up in the second quarter after a weak start to 1997 . 
domestic demand appeared to be recovering . 
households had increased their purchases of durable goods , consumers were becoming more optimistic , and investment was turning upwards . 
both export and imports were rising strongly . 
&quot; The Swedish economy still has unutilised resources . 
this is an important reason why we can have relatively good growth that is compatible with low inflation , &quot; Heikensten said . 
he said business sector productivity was rising in a way that was favourable to inflation . 
since June . 
the crown &apos;s exchange rate in terms of the Trade Currency weighted index has appreciared a couple of percent . 
preliminary figures show the rate of wage increases has slowed since the summer of 1996 . 
the bank &apos;s next inflation report will be published on September 23 .
