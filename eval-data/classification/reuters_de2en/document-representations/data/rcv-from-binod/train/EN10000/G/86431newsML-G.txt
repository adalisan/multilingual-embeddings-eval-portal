a Labour government would work with outside investors on capital projects for the health service but is against letting the private sector run NHS hospitals , health spokesman Chris Smith said on Monday . 
in the text of a speech prepared for the opening session of Labour &apos;s annual conference , Smith said it made financial sense to involve the private sector in partnerships to design and build new hospitals . 
&quot; But Labour is totally opposed to the use of the Private Finance Initiative to privatise the operation of our hospitals in the way the Tories have planned , &quot; Smith said . 
pledging that Labour would never accept what he called the Conservatives &apos; privatising agenda for the health service , Smith said a Labour government would bring the assets of all the trusts and health authorities back into the ownership of the National Health Service . 
Smith said Labour would ban tobacco advertising and restore a national framework for pay levels in the health service . 
he also reaffirmed Labour &apos;s plan to replace the competitive internal market for health care by a system of GP commissioning . 
this would bring together the GPs , health authority and hospitals of an area to decide patterns of care and treatment . 
labour has promised as one of its five core manifesto pledges to cut the cost of NHS bureaucracy by 100 million stg and to use the money to reduce patient waiting lists by 100,000 . 
fleshing out that proposal , Smith said Labour would direct the savings into those parts of the service where cutting down on waiting times could probably do the most good . 
specifically , he promised that a Labour government would end all waiting lists for surgery to tackle cancer . 
&quot; Labour will ensure , as we implement our pledge , that no one diagnosed as requiring surgey for cancer will have to wait . 
at all , &quot; he said .
