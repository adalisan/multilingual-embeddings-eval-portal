U.N. special envoy for Western Sahara James Baker started a fact-finding mission on Wednesday in Morocco on the disputed territory which has eluded solution for over two decades and undermined regional cooperation . 
the former U.S. Secretary of State &apos;s visit follows threats last month of renewed war by the Polisario Front , which seeks independence in the Western Sahara . 
his appointment as special envoy to U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan also reflected United Nations frustration over lack of progress in resolving an issue which has soured relations between Algeria and Morocco . 
Baker told reporters at Rabat airport : &quot; The U.N. Secretary- general has asked me to come here as his personal envoy to make a fresh assessment of the situation ... during this trip I will be primarily listening to all parties ... I am here to listen . 
Rabat controls most of the territory and says it is part of Morocco , a claim underpinned in November 1975 when King Hassan launched a &quot; Green March &quot; and 350,000 unarmed Moroccans crossed into the then Spanish colony . 
days later Spain agreed to transfer the administration to Morocco and Mauritania . 
there are no reliable figures for the numbers killed since the Polisario took up arms 1976 in a conflict ended by a U.N.- brokered ceasefire in September 1991 . 
this is monitored by a U.N. force known as Minurso , whose numbers have been reduced to some 230 military observers and support personnel . 
while its peacekeeping role is seen as a success , its cost drains U.N. resources and U.N. efforts to hold a referendum to let the Sahrawis choose between integration in Morocco or independence have got nowhere . 
the ballot should have been held in January 1992 but has been stalled by rows over who should be allowed to vote . 
the dispute has fuelled regional tension . 
Algeria has long backed the Polisario Front , angering Morocco and undermining attempts at North African unity in the Arab Maghreb Union set up in 1989 to try to create a vibrant trading block . 
the two countries , along with Mauritania , Libya and Tunis , are members of the bloc . 
diplomatic sources say that Baker , whose diplomacy helped convene the Madrid peace conference on the Middle East , will need all his persuasive powers to resolve the issue . 
Moroccan and Polisario front representatives met late last year for direct talks , attended by Crown Prince Sidi Mohammed , in the Moroccan capital . 
diplomats say the talks failed to overcome differences . 
appointed by Annan last month , Baker is to meet King Hassan and hold talks with Interior Minister Driss Basri in Morocco before going to Algiers , Tindouf , and Mauritania . 
Baker does not expect to produce immediate initiatives , saying he will listen and then report back to Annan . 
he added that he would return to the region later but gave no date . 
Polisario , whose main camp is just inside Algeria in Tindouf , has welcomed Baker &apos;s appointment , and described his trip as an important &quot; diplomatic event for the peaceful resolution of the conflict &quot; . 
last month the Security Council expressed disappointment at the lack of progress in organising the referendum and warned that any breach of the ceasefire &quot; could seriously threaten regional stability &quot; .
