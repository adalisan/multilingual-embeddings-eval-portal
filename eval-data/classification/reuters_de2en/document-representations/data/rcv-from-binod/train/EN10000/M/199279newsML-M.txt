the mark ended little changed in European trading with the lira staging a roller-coaster session during the day and erasing early gains in late trade . 
the Italian unit was buoyed early in Europe amid speculation of an imminent entry to the European exchange rate mechanism and was helped higher after Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said talks about ERM re-entry could start anytime from now . 
&quot; With the approval of the budget in the lower house , I believe talks about the re-entry of the lira to the ERM can start , &quot; Prodi said at a news conference in Rome . 
the lower house of parliament passed the budget last weekend . 
Prodi met with Italian unions today and they effectively endorsed his 1997 budget too . 
Union leaders said the Euro tax , which is aimed at meeting European monetary union budgetary criteria next year , was satisfactory . 
Chris Turner , currency strategist at BZW , said the lira &apos;s ERM re-entry should not be too far off and believed the lira would rejoin at a rate between 1000 and 1010 per mark . 
at 1515 GMT , the lira was trading at 1007.30 / 7.65 per mark , compared with 1007.50 / 7.85 at yesterday &apos;s close and an intraday high at 1006.15 . 
elsewhere , the mark ended mixed on other cross rates , a little higher against the French franc and a little lower against the Spanish peseta , for example . 
its perfromance against the dollar is crucial , however , analysts said . 
today , it hovered just above 1.50 per dollar . 
overnight , Bundesbank council member Ernst Welteke cleared up confusion about remarks which weakened the dollar on Monday and he reiterated the central bank view that they preferred a stable , stronger dollar . 
&quot; The Welteke correction will prove mildly dollar supportive in a market that is busily winding down for the year-end , &quot; said Joe Prendergast , foreign exchange strategist at Merrill Lynch . 
that support for the dollar is important as funds still look to take profits on European convergence trades , he said . 
the dollar was little moved later by news of a bigger-than- expected 5.1 percent drop in U.S. housing starts . 
credit markets rallied in both the U.S. and Europe , however . 
the release of October German M3 figures later this week , and the IFO business climate survey on Wednesday are awaited for further clues to the strength of the German economy and the immediate outlook for interest rates there . 
Klaus Baader , strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell , said October German M3 is likely to be pushed up by the recent flotation of Deutsche Telekom flotation as investors took money from savings accounts and moved them to sight deposits . 
but , &quot; this is well expected and should have little effect on the mark , &quot; said Baader . 
he put the annualised growth rate at 8.50-to-8.75 percent and &quot; not more than nine percent . 
at 15 : 15 the mark was trading at 1.5022 / 27 , compared with 1.5003 / 08 at yesterday &apos;s close . 
Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said Monday the Telekom flotation was unlikely to have adverse effect on M3 . 
last week , chief economist Otmar Issing said it may have a short-term effect but would not cause the Bundesbank to &quot; rip out its hair . 
the French franc weakened slightly mid- morning but firmed again in afternoon trade to 3.3821 / 26 at 1535 GMT , compared with 3.3813 / 17 at yesterday &apos;s close . 
French President Jacques Chirac dismissed rumours on Tuesday that a cabinet reshuffle was imminent .
