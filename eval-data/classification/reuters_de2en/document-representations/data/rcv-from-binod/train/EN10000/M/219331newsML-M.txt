U.S. treasuries ended mostly higher on Wednesday after a shortened trading session featuring a mixed bag of economic data , some technically motivated selling , and pre-holiday position squaring . 
it will be closed on Thursday for thanksgiving Day and trading hours will be abbreviated again on Friday when the market will close at 1400 est . 
on Wednesday , the market opened higher , erased its gains at mid-morning , and firmed up again in late trade . 
&quot; A lot of the selling ( in the middle of the session ) was technically based , &quot; said Lee Youngdahl , analyst at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co . &quot; The market needed weak economic data to go much higher and it didn &apos;t get them . 
&quot; Flows were pretty light all day , &quot; said Matthew Alexy , CS First Boston chief markets stragegist . 
&quot; The market was waiting for friendly ( economic ) numbers to get things juiced up and they never really got them . 
early in the trading session , the government reported its revisions to third-quarter GDP ( Gross Domestic Product ) data and the latest weekly figures on jobless claims . 
new jobless claims stayed steady at 342,000 in the latest week . 
James Glassman , vice president and economist at Chase Securities Inc . , said that while the stream of new claims for unemployment benefits remained steady , continued claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to drop . 
&quot; To me , that confirms that the Labor market is still very healthy , &quot; said Glassman . 
the next batch of data the market got was more negative for the bond market . 
strong economic signals are generally dismaying to bond investors who fear that strong growth will spur inflation that will eat away at the worthy of their fixed-income investment . 
the government reported that durable goods orders rose a slightly 0.1 percent in October . 
&quot; durable goods orders without ( the volatile transportation component were ) very strong , &quot; said Youngdahl . 
also , contrary to expectations , the October Chicago Purchasing Managers index rose -- to 57.6 from 56.9 . 
&quot; durable goods and the Chicago PMI certainly didn &apos;t help the cause , &quot; said Alexy . 
William Hornbarger , fixed-income strategist at A.G. Edwards &amp; sons Inc . , said the durable goods orders report and the Chicago purchasing managers index provided &quot; an excuse &quot; to take some profits . 
&quot; Bonds have gotten very comfortable around the levels where they are right now and people were willing to take some profits and square positions before going into the long holiday weekend , &quot; Hornbarger said . 
three- , six- and year-bill rates finished unchanged at 5.02 percent , 5.06 percent and 5.13 percent on Wednesday . 
two-year notes also ended unchanged at 99-30 / 32 , yielding 5.66 percent . 
five-year notes rose 1 / 32 to 99-27 / 32 , yielding 5.91 percent .
