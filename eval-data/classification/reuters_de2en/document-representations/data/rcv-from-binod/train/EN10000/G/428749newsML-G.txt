Italy airlifted 33 people from the troubled Albanian port of Vlore on Saturday but said it was refusing asylum requests from refugees fleeing unrest in the Balkan state and would send them back . 
&quot; Although we understand their fear of being caught up in the disorder in the south ... the government does not consider that the public order situation in the rest of the country presents conditions of emergency or other risks for personal safety , &quot; the interior and foreign ministries said in a joint statement . 
Italy has stepped up security along its coast , just 40 miles across the Adriatic from southern Albania , amid fears that armed insurrection there would spark a mass exodus of refugees . 
tens of thousands of Albanians crossed to Italy in rusting freighters in 1991 after 45 years of Stalinist rule crumbled in Europe &apos;s poorest country . 
thousands more follow every year in illegal immigration rackets . 
&quot; We &apos;re not slamming the door , but the situation has to be regulated , &quot; said one diplomatic source , noting that southern Italy already had big illegal immigrant and jobless problems . 
&quot; We want to discourage refugees . 
obviously if children come across we &apos;re not going to throw them in the sea , &quot; he said . 
preparations for the repatriations were expected to begin soon . 
several boatloads of Albanian refugees have already arrived in Italy and two Albanian pilots also flew their MiG-15 jet into a military airbase this week requesting political asylum . 
the statement said the Italian government &quot; noted with preoccupation continual arrivals ... of Albanian citizens largely coming from Vlore and nearby regions &quot; . 
it said refugees without legal entry papers would be sent back to Durres , a port near Tirana , and then on to the capital . 
Italy was prepared to set up a centre in Durres , possibly staffed by Italian humanitarian agency and government officials , to assist the repatriation effort , it said . 
Albanian rebels tightened their grip on the south of the country , which they now mostly control from Vlore to the Greek border , seizing the government stronghold of Gjirokaster on Saturday in a humiliating defeat for President Sali Berisha . 
anti-government protests began after the collapse in January of get-rich-quick investment schemes leaving tens of thousands penniless . 
Albanians blame Berisha for allowing the schemes to flourish and rebels have vowed not to give up until he quits . 
Italy said it was studying sending urgent supplies and humanitarian aid to the south of Albania , in agreement with the Albanian authorities via the Red Cross . 
the decision to refuse asylum seekers came after Italy &apos;s second military rescue mission of the week . 
navy helicopters swooped into Vlore and brought 12 Italians and 21 Albanians -- either relations of the Italians , Albanians who had previously been resident in Italy or who had helped the Italian community in Vlore -- safely back to Brindisi . 
thirty five people were airlifted similarly on Monday . 
seventy Albanians crossed from Vlore on Friday but Italy failed in attempts to repatriate some of them when the Albanians refused to board a waiting ferry and asked for political asylum .
