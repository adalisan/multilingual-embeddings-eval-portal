Jordan &apos;s King Hussein will visit Israel on Sunday to pay condolences to the families of seven schoolgirls killed by one of his soldiers , a government spokesman said on Saturday . 
the king expressed shame and shock after the attack , which came against a backdrop of worsening Jordanian-Israeli relations over Israeli settlement plans in Arab East Jerusalem . 
&quot; The king spoke by telephone with Prime Minister ( Benjamin ) Netanyahu yesterday afternoon , &quot; the spokesman said . 
&quot; The two agreed that the king will arrive on Sunday and will visit the families of the girls killed in Naharayim , &quot; he said . 
Jordanian army driver Sergeant Ahmed Mousa Mustafa al-Daqamsa emptied the clip of his rifle on Thursday at the girls on a school trip to a strip of Jordanian land south of the Sea of Galilee leased to Israel under a 1994 peace treaty . 
he was arrested . 
Jordan has launched an inquiry into his motives .
