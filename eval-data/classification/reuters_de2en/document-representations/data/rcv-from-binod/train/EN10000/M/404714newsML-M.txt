German shares ended Wednesday in positive territory , recovering quickly from a brief sharp slide after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan raised the chilling prospect of an interest rate rise . 
the previously sagging dollar jumped more that a pfennig on Greenspan &apos;s comments , helping the German share market to quickly recoup its losses . 
the IBIS DAX index , which tracks electronic trade in Germany &apos;s 30 blue chip stocks , ended up 11.68 points at 3,245.02 points , having dropped to a low of 3,216.94 points immediately after Greenspan &apos;s comments . 
in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony , Greenspan said he did not rule out a pre-emptive tightening of monetary policy , saying that he saw an upside risk on inflation . 
dealers said the market had been prepared for almost any eventuality with regard to the Greenspan speech , and many said they did not expect the remarks to have a lasting effect . 
&quot; We might have a two-day blip , a bit of a delay , but then we &apos;ll be back on our way ( up ) , &quot; said one bullish trader . 
&quot; With so many analysts upgrading their estimates on German companies , and we haven &apos;t even counted in the tax reform fully yet , there &apos;s still some room to go , &quot; he said . 
the outperformer of the day was pharmaceutical company Schering , which surged to a new all-time high of 155 marks and ended post-bourse trade with gains of 4.2 percent at 152.30 marks .
