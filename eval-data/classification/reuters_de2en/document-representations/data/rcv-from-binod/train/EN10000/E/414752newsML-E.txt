domestic demand in Israel as measured by retail sales showed renewed growth in the last two months of 1996 , but most other indicators pointed to a slower economy , the Central Bureau of Statistics said on Monday . 
based on value-added tax receipts , the bureau said , retail sales grew at an annualised rate of two to three percent in November and December 1996 , after virtually no growth in the previous eight months . 
sales of organised retail chains , which account for about a quarter of total retail sales , rose at an annualised rate of nine percent in December 1996 and January 1997 , after seven to eight percent in the previous five months . 
industrial production rose at an annualised rate of five percent in December 1996 , up from four percent rate in October-November , the bureau said . 
imports of industrial inputs were almost unchanged in January after falling relatively sharply since second-quarter 1996 . 
imports of capital goods fell at an annualised rate of 18 percent -- the same rate at which they have been falling since April 1996 . 
exports of industrial products , not counting diamonds and exports to the Palestinian areas , rose at an annualised rate of seven percent in January , slower than the 10-15 percent rate in the second half of 1996 . 
overall merchandise export growth , not counting diamonds , rose at an annualised rate of six percent in January , down from 9-10 percent in September-December 1996 , the bureau said . 
the jobless rate rose to an average of seven percent in the fourth quarter from 6.6 percent in the third . 
the bureau said consumer prices rose at an annualised rate of nine percent rate in January -- unchanged from December but slightly higher than July-November . 
&quot; In spite of this , the decline in the rise of consumer prices , discounting housing and produce prices , continued , with this index rising seven percent compared with eight percent in October-December and 9-10 percent in July-September , &quot; the bureau said .
