NWE naphtha swap values dipped slightly earlier on Thursday before regaining nearly all of the lost ground by late trading , the fluctuations almost entirely put down by traders to modest crude futures movements . 
two stand-alone swap trades were heard done during the afternoon at $ 186 for August and $ 184.75 for September , levels which were seen as market values by late afternoon , with October seen in parity with September . 
brokers also referred to naphtha / mogas August spread talk in the $ 9- $ 10 range during the day as an August / September spread trade was rumoured at $ 1 . 
dealers described the naphtha market as stable to slightly firm in both the Med and NWE . 
&quot; There are not many cargoes on offer but not many buyers either , &quot; a trader commented , but said &quot; it &apos;s harder to buy than sell .
