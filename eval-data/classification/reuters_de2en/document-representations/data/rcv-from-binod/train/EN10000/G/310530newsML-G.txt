Sudanese Vice President al-Zubeir Mohammad Saleh arrived in Cairo unexpectedly on Wednesday as his country mobilised for conflict against advancing rebels . 
Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri met Major-General Saleh at the airport and they left together , airport sources said . 
one official said Saleh went to the offices of President Hosni Mubarak . 
but presidency sources said Mubarak had no appointments on Wednesday morning and the press was not invited . 
Saleh is the most senior Sudanese to visit Egypt since President Omar Hassan al-Bashir came in July for an Arab summit . 
relations have been extremely bad for years , especially since Egypt said Sudan helped the Egyptian Islamists who tried to kill Mubarak in Addis Ababa in 1995 . 
Sudan denies this . 
two of Sudan &apos;s neighbours , Eritrea and Uganda , have broken relations with Khartoum but Egypt has refused to follow suit , arguing that this would damage the Sudanese people . 
Cairo also has an uneasy relationship with some of the opposition groups fighting the Khartoum government . 
for fear of the implications for the Nile waters , it does not want southern Sudan to secede . 
historically it has never been happy with the Mahdist movement , the largest element in the northern opposition to the Islamist government . 
Mahdist leader and former prime minister Sadeq al-Mahdi , who is now in Cairo , said this month that he did not expect Egypt to provide any military support for opposition forces . 
&quot; In the past the relationship with Egypt was marred by ambiguity and a lack of clarity of vision , &quot; Mahdi said in an interview with the Arabic newspaper al-Hayat this week . 
&quot; Now the situation is clear and the meetings at the popular and executive levels have been fruitful , exceeding expectations , &quot; added Mahdi , who saw Mubarak on January 2 . 
opposition spokesman Farouq Abu Eissa , commenting on Saleh &apos;s visit on Wednesday , said : &quot; They ( the Sudanese ) government are in a panic . 
it &apos;s clear they are isolated . 
the rebels say they are advancing in two areas , in Blue Nile province along the Ethiopian border and around the town of Kassala close to the Eritrean border . 
Sudan says Ethiopian forces are attacking but both Ethiopia and the rebels deny this .
