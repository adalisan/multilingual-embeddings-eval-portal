Australian shares finished at their highs for the session on Monday as relieved investors went on the hunt for bargains after the Dow on Friday halted its recent sharp pull-back . 
the key share market barometer , the All Ordinaries index , closed 19.8 points up at 2,336.3 , its session high . 
investors bid stocks up across the board with cyclical sectors , transport and building materials , amongst the most sought after on the day . 
&quot; The big factor today was relief , &quot; a dealer from a Brisbane-based brokerage said . 
&quot; The talk on Friday was of an extended fall for the Wall Street market . 
it didn &apos;t happen and now investors are much more confident of the traditional rise to Christmas , &quot; he said . 
the dealer said fundamental factors like commodity prices had little influence on investors &apos; buying decisions . 
&quot; It was all sentiment today -- I wouldn &apos;t call it a strong bull market but good turnover and the strong debut of Infrastructure Trust ( Group of Australia ) certainly indicates the return of higher confidence levels , &quot; the dealer said . 
although cyclical stocks found the cream of buyers &apos; cash , underpinning the market &apos;s rise was solid buying support for the major banks which were hardest hit by selling late last week . 
the strong debut of Infrastructure Trust Group of Australia ( ITA Group ) also bolstered sentiment as stags reaped up to a 40 percent premium from the tollway investor &apos;s stapled securities .
