Nicola Minali achieved his second stage victory of the Tour of Spain on Saturday -- catching fellow Italian Giovanni Lombardi at the line in yet another sprint finish . 
all eight stages have ended the same way , with five won by Italians . 
Fabio Baldato , also from Italy , remained overall leader with Frenchman Laurent Jalabert a provisional 21 seconds behind . 
Minali said he had been helped by an uncharacteristic break for the line made by home favourite Miguel Indurain . 
early in the 220 km haul from Marbella to Jerez several other big names , including three times winner Tony Rominger of Switzerland and Frenchman Armand de las Cuevas , had tried to steal away . 
a last-ditch attack by Italian Marco di Renzo was quickly neutralized two kilometres from home . 
with the Tour urgently needing a change of pace after more than a week of largely monotonous action outside the final moments of each stage , the riders tackle the 162 km ninth section between Jerez and Cordoba on Sunday . 
Russian Dmitry Konyshev was fined and handed a time penalty by Tour organisers after an incident in which American climbing specialist Bobby Julich fell . 
race officials concluded that Konyshev had behaved incorrectly and was responsible for the crash . 
he was penalised 20 seconds in the overall standings and fined 60,000 pesetas ( $ 480 ) .
