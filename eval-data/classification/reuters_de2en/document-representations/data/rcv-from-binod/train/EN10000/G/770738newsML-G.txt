an Alaska judge late Wednesday issued an injunction temporarily blocking a new law banning so-called &quot; partial-birth &quot; abortions on the eve of its effective date . 
&quot; Our privacy rights are essential , and government cannot take them from us without very strong reasons in support of more important rights , &quot; Alaska Superior Court Judge John Reese said in a hearing on a motion filed by abortion-rights advocates . 
&quot; The rules and the procedures of the Constitution are alive , clear and constant parts of our lives . 
criminal laws cannot be vague . 
it is fundamentally , constitutionally unfair if they are , &quot; Reese said . 
opponents of the state abortion restriction hailed Reese &apos;s order . 
&quot; I &apos;m very pleased , &quot; said Stephen Williams , attorney for Planned Parenthood of Alaska , the Alaska Civil Liberties Union and a group of doctors and abortion-rights groups , which sued last week to overturn the law . 
&quot; We did not want this statute , which infringes on women &apos;s privacy rights , their personal liberty and the rights of their doctors to provide proper medical care , to go into effect , &quot; he said . 
the law also violates the state constitution &apos;s due-process protections because it makes a felony out of an &quot; ill-defined &quot; procedure that lacks medical recognition , Williams argued . 
the Republican-controlled state legislature passed the ban on the late term abortion procedure in May , overriding a veto by Democratic Gov. 
Tony Knowles , saying it should be effective as of July 31 . 
Knowles and Alaska Attorney General Bruce Botelho have condemned it as a violation of the Alaska and U.S. Constitutions . 
but after the legislature enacted the ban over their objections , the state was legally obligated to defend it . 
Fairbanks District Attorney Harry Davis , who volunteered to take the case on behalf of the state Department of Law , told Reese by telephone the law was a legitimate measure to protect Alaskans against what he termed a &quot; barbaric &quot; procedure that involves partial extraction of a foetus . 
he also defended the law as supported by a vast majority of the public . 
but Reese rejected that as a justification . 
Williams said he and Davis will work on a schedule to determine future steps in the case . 
a law mandating that girls under 17 get their parents &apos; permission before obtaining an abortion was still scheduled to go into effect Thursday . 
planned Parenthood , the ACLU and other abortion-rights advocates had sued to overturn the law , also passed by the legislature over the governor &apos;s veto . 
the plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order , but the judge on that case was on vacation . 
a hearing was expected to be scheduled next week , said Theda Pittman , coordinator of the Alaska pro-choice Coalition .
