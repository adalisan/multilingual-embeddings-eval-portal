the won rose against the dollar in late trading on Wednesday , after follow-through buying in the U.S. unit failed to emerge as had been expected , traders said . 
the won ended at 828.80 after opening at 829.50 . 
it ranged between 828.70 and 830.30 . 
&quot; The market tried to rise earlier in the day , but felt that 830 was not a comfortable level for the dollar , &quot; said a Standard Chartered Bank dealer . 
&quot; As we approach the end of the month , supply and demand will start evening out , so players were reluctant to buy dollars . 
dealers said that expected buying of about $ 100 million by the Office of Supply did not materialise , sending sentiment toward the dollar down . 
they added that Thursday &apos;s trading trend would be set by the dollar &apos;s movement against the Japanese yen on world markets . 
the won / dollar range was expected to be around 828.50-829.50 . 
if the dollar rose above 112 yen , the won / dollar could test the 830 level again , they said . 
the central bank pegged Thursday &apos;s mid-rate at 829.50 , against 828.50 on Wednesday .
