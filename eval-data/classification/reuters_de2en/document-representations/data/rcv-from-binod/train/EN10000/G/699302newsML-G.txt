a paper to be submitted to Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders in talks next week will be largely a summary of remarks to be made by the U.N. special adviser for Cyprus , Diego Cordovez , a U.N. source said on Tuesday . 
playing down the significance of the paper , the source said the intention would be to assist the two leaders , Glafcos Clerides and Rauf Denktash , by listing Cordovez &apos;s main talking points . 
Denktash said earlier in Nicosia that he might not attend the talks if any document were placed on the table before he had been informed of its contents . 
the U.N. source , close to planning for the talks , said : &quot; Cordovez wants to launch the discussions . 
he wants to set out his thoughts and do that orally . 
his idea was then to help things along by giving the talking points in the form of an informal discussion paper . 
that and only that is the intention behind this paper . 
the source said the two sides should not attach too much importance to the paper , adding : &quot; It &apos;ll be a very informal paper , small p , not a Document , big D. &quot; 
the talks are due to begin July 9 at Troutbeck , a rural resort 90 miles ( 145 km ) north of New York city and continue until July 13 . 
Clerides is president of the internationally-recognised Greek Cypriot-led government in Nicosia , and Denktash heads a Turkish Cypriot state recognised only by Turkey . 
the purpose of this first face-to-face encounter in nearly three years between the two men would be to revive stalled negotiations on reuniting the divided island under a bi-communal , bi-zonal federation . 
Cyprus has been virtually partitioned since 1974 when troops from Turkey took over the north of the island after a coup in Nicosia engineered by the military junta then ruling Greece . 
the Greek and Turkish communities have been estranged since 1963 when a government in which both took part broke down , three years after independence from Britain . 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan is scheduled to address the opening session and then hand over to Cordovez , a former foreign minister of Ecuador . 
Cordovez is due in New York next Monday .
