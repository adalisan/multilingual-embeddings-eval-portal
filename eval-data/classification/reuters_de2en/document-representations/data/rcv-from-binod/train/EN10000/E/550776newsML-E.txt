Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Jack Guynn said on Wednesday a key issue for the Fed is whether the buoyant rate of U.S. economic growth results from higher productivity or indicates an accommodative monetary policy that may lead to higher inflation . 
&quot; We got the first official report on first-quarter GDP ( Gross Domestic Product ) growth just this morning and it confirmed the economy has been growing faster than most of us suspected , &quot; Guynn told the Rotary Club of New Orleans . 
Guynn said this leads him to think 1997 GDP growth may be above 1996 &apos;s 2.5-percent rate , though he expected a slowdown later this year and into 1998 . 
&quot; What is behind all that growth ? 
where is it coming from ? 
&quot; Guynn asked , adding the Fed sees consumer spending as the steam engine of the expansion -- but its main challenge as well . 
&quot; We have all seen the reports ... month after month , strong job growth , strong income growth , &quot; Guynn noted . 
&quot; The greatest risk going forward is on the upside , and the largest upside risk is in the area of consumer demand which accounts for about two-thirds of GDP , &quot; Guynn stressed .
