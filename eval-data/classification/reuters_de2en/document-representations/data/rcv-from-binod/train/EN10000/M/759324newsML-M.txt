trade on the South African bond market was hesitant on Monday as players awaited the release of key private sector credit extension and money supply data in the late afternoon . 
the yield on the benchmark R150 stock climbed back above the 14 percent figure to trade at 14.010 percent at 1400 GMT on Monday from 13.995 percent on Friday . 
&quot; If the ( M3 and credit ) figures are good , we &apos;ll see this market move even further ( southwards ) , &quot; a senior bond trader said . 
&quot; Much depends on foreign interest though because local buying has dissipated . 
most of the guys are very long , &quot; he said . 
if the numbers are in line with expectations , some dealers expect benchmark gilts to fall as low as 13.75 percent . 
positive numbers would reinforce renewed hopes that the Reserve Bank will cut interest rates by one percentage point in the next few weeks , dealers said . 
those hopes were underlined at the weekend by bullish statements by Reserve Bank deputy governor Chris de Swart that a decline in interest rates could soon be on the cards . 
a Reuters consensus poll of economists forecast money supply growth would rise 14.4 percent year-on-year compared with a preliminary 15.4 percent increase in May . 
the consensus forecast for credit extension was for a 15.19 percent year-on-year rise from May &apos;s 16.57 percent . 
intraday trade was uneventful , bond traders said , marked by local profit-taking . 
&quot; Things will definitely hot up tomorrow as the market digests the credit and M3 figures , &quot; one dealer said . 
in addition , consumer inflation and trade numbers are expected on Tuesday while gold and foreign exchange reserves are due on Friday . 
on the forex market the rand was knocked early by a large import order , managed to recover with then help of the Reserve Bank and exporters , but then succumbed again to importer dollar demand and rand sales out of London . 
at 1400 GMT the unit was changing hands at 4.5725 / 5755 to the dollar from a morning &apos;s weakest bid of 4.5750 -- a fresh six-month low -- and 4.5635 / 5665 at 1400 GMT on Friday . 
&quot; There were bits and pieces of exporter interest but lots of importers and ( rand ) selling out of London , &quot; said a senior forex trader . 
another noted that there was little scope for the currency to strenghten in the face of a rampant dollar and a bearish local close on Friday . 
&quot; It will weaken but we expect that 4.58 will still hold . 
in cross rate action , the rand was last stronger at 7.4770 / 4864 versus sterling from 7.5990 / 6085 as cable skidded against the mark in Europe . 
the local unit was still above 40 pfennigs against the mark and was last changing hands at 0.4035 / 4039 from 0.4027 / 4031 Thursday . 
against the yen , the rand was fetching 25.6999 / 7277 from a previous level of 25.4932 / 5318 . 
foreigners bought 569.69 million rands worth of South African bonds on Friday after buying 428.39 million on Thursday , the Bond Exchange said . 
bond Exchange turnover was at 7.23 billion rand on Friday from 53.4 billion rand on Thursday -- a settlement day . 
the South African Reserve Bank said the money market shortage fell to 7.345 billion rand on Saturday from 7.360 billion rand on Friday . 
on the money market , offered rates for three-month NCDs were steady at 15.55 percent , while the 90-day BA rate also lined up unchanged at 15.00 percent .
