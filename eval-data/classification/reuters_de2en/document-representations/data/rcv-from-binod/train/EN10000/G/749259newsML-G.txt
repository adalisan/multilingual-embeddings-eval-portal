NATO chief Javier Solana said on Wednesday the strategic benefits of NATO expansion were huge and that he believed ties with Russia would remain strong despite its opposition to enlargement . 
seeking to allay Russian jitters over expansion , Solana assured Moscow the alliance would listen closely to its objections . 
&quot; Russia cannot expect to love NATO &apos;s own separate decision-taking , but what Russia can expect is that NATO will listen to serious , legitimate points it makes , &quot; the NATO Secretary General told a conference at the State Department . 
&quot; Our desire to build a security architecture with Russia is a genuine one , &quot; he added . 
the 16-member military alliance invited the Czech Republic , Hungary and Poland to join NATO at a summit in Madrid earlier this month . 
NATO &apos;s current members also agreed to keep the door open to future applicants after the first wave is expected to enter in April 1999 . 
Moscow strongly opposes expanding NATO , particularly to the Baltic states , believing it will pose a military threat to Russia . 
Solana said he believed it was possible to have both enlargement and a good relationship with Russia . 
&quot; Only six months ago , many thought we would have to choose between NATO enlargement and Russia . 
we have now come to learn that we can have both , &quot; he said . 
he said the strategic benefits of enlargement should no longer be in doubt . 
they would give eastern democracies confidence in their future economic and political development and would also provide a cost-effective security system . 
&quot; The acceptance of new members should be seen as a gain rather than a burden , &quot; he said . 
earlier , Russia &apos;s envoy to the United States , Yuli Vorontsov , described NATO expansion as possibly the &quot; last mistake of this century . 
&quot; Don &apos;t continue the mistakes of the 20th century into the 21st century , &quot; he told delegates . 
&quot; Why do you want to move the military machine of NATO to our borders ? 
Vorontsov said his country was particularly concerned about the situation in the Baltic states . 
he stressed Russia was strongly against the positioning , for example , of any strategic weapons on Estonian soil . 
&quot; Our reaction will be very fierce , &quot; he warned . 
NATO has said it has no plans to station nuclear weapons on the territory of any new member . 
despite Russia &apos;s opposition to enlargement , Vorontsov said his country was looking forward to a positive relationship with the alliance . 
he said the first meeting of a NATO-Russia council on July 18 had gone well and rules and procedures were laid down for another meeting on Sept . 11 and one at a ministerial level on Sept . 22 . 
the council meetings emerged after Russia signed a Founding Act with NATO in May , establishing a new post-Cold War relationship with the alliance .
