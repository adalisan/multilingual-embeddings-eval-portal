Istanbul shares slumped in sharply lower volume on Tuesday as renewed political concerns and higher yield in the Treasury &apos;s bond auction annoyed the market , brokers said . 
the IMKB National-100 closed at 1,577 , down 74 points , or 4.48 percent from Monday when it eased 0.18 percent after last week &apos;s 10.34 percent surge prompted by privatisation hopes after the fading of political tension . 
trade volume plunged to 26.15 trillion lira ( $ 206.3 million ) from Monday &apos;s 40.73 trillion ( $ 321.5 million ) . 
the index had lost 3.09 percent in morning sales prompted by political worries which flared ahead of a National Security Council ( MGK ) meeting expected next week . 
&quot; The market focused on political events and the upcoming MGK meeting in the absence of moving expectations . 
the bond auction results also showed that the yields are on the rise , &quot; said Cem Baycan from Delta securities . 
the coalition government &apos;s Islamist wing opposes a plan to raise compulsory education to eight years from five as part of measures put forward at the military-dominated MGK &apos;s February 28 meeting to clamp down on rising Islamist activism . 
the yield in the Treasury &apos;s 399-day bond auction jumped to 114.71 percent from 106.77 percent in last week &apos;s 399-day bond sale . 
the Treasury alloted 344.5 trillion lira of a total 377.3 trillion lira demand . 
the results were in line with previous expectations that demand in the auction would be weak and the Treasury would be forced to accept higher yields to meet its 189.3 trillion lira redemption on Wednesday after using all of the central bank cash advances available for 1997 .
