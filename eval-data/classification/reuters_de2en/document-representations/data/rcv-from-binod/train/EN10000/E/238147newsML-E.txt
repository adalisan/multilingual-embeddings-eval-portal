the Bank of Lebanon &apos;s net foreign exchange reserves have topped $ 4 billion , a historic record , central bank governor Riad Salameh said on Thursday . 
&quot; These reserves have topped $ 4 billion if we exclude the banking sector &apos;s deposits ( with the Bank ) and if we exclude the gold ( reserves ) . 
this is the highest level in the history of the Bank of Lebanon , &quot; Salameh told as-Safir daily in an interview . 
net reserves were $ 2,858 million at the end of 1995 compared with $ 2,732 million at the end of 1994 , according to central bank figures . 
bi-weekly bank figures issued on Tuesday , showed that gross foreign exchange reserves , which include commercial banks deposits with the central bank , have risen to $ 5,767.45 million at the end of November from $ 5,566.03 million in mid-November . 
gold reserves were $ 3.499 billion at the end of September . 
Salameh said the rise in net reserves has encouraged the central bank to change its intervention mechanism on the Beirut foreign exchange market by shifting from a single mid-price quotation to a bid-offer system in recent months . 
dealers have said the change would stimulate interbank trading . 
the bank &apos;s practice of setting a single price for the past few years had idled Beirut foreign exchange dealers by making the market dependent on the central bank for buying and selling dollars . 
the Bank of Lebanon offered to buy dollars at 1,549 Lebanese pounds and to sell at 1,558 on Thursday . 
the dollar closed at 1,553.50 pounds .
