new Zealand share prices ended mostly firmer on Monday afer leading stock Telecom staged a partial comeback to close at NZ $ 6.70 , up 10 . 
the gain in Telecom outweighed a generally flat market , pushing the top 40 index 6.84 points higher to 2,308.37 on turnover worth NZ $ 47.8 million . 
telecom had traded a NZ $ 6.62-6.75 range on the day and topped the turnover list with 2.76 million shares , worth NZ $ 18.42 million , trading . 
telecom was left severely bruised by a 25 cent sell-off on Friday on concern that major offshore investment houses may be looking to trim their holdings . 
Phil Hardie Boys at BZW said he expected more volatility in Telecom while it tried to find a level . 
&quot; traditionally , when stocks have a big selloff like that they do tend to bounce around a little before they settle , &quot; he said . 
with it being a typically Monday &apos;s trade , Hardie Boys said the the next few days might see Telecom find a suitable level . 
looking ahead , there were first half results due from the Fletcher Challenge &quot; letter &quot; stocks on Wednesday . 
Fletcher Energy and Building are expected to stand out in terms of profitability , while FCL Paper and Forests are likely to take a hammering from depressed commodity markets . 
among Monday &apos;s major announcements , Independent Newspapers reported a slight gain in first half profit to NZ $ 26.19 million , up from $ 25.96 million . 
the publisher said it had yet to resolve issues over its proposed stake in pay TV operator Sky .
