implied volatilities for U.S. debt options fell Thursday following the final leg of the Treasury &apos;s three-part $ 38 billion quarterly refunding . 
Treasury sold $ 10 billion of 30-year bonds this afternoon , on top of its three- and 10-year note sales earlier this week . 
September bond options volatility declined to close at about 7.35 percent after the midday auction , down from 7.50 percent just prior to the bidding deadline , options brokers said . 
it opened at 7.55 percent , then dipped to 7.40 percent midmorning before rising into the auction , they noted . 
December Eurodollar volatility shed 0.5 percentage point to 8.8 percent , while March was steady at 11.0 percent . 
&quot; mainly it &apos;s just that we got through the auction and the exposure is gone , &quot; said one Eurodollar options analyst . 
he added that Eurodollar volatilities had been inflated earlier this week in reaction to Friday &apos;s sharp plunge in the underlying futures . 
bond traders said auction-related activity kept the pace of options trading fairly brisk throughout the day . 
around midsession , one dealer firm bought 2,000 September 114-00 / 115-00 bond put spreads . 
the same dealer also sold 3,000 September 94.25 Eurodollar straddles while purchasing 3,000 short-dated September 93.75 puts . 
earlier , a second dealer bought 2,500 September 115-00 / 116-00 bond call spreads , and a European banking firm sold 2,000 September 114-00 puts .
