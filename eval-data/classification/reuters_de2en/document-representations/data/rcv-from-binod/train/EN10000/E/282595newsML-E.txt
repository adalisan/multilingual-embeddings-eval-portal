Singapore &apos;s economy grew by a solid 6.5 percent in 1996 despite the impact of a global electronics slowdown in the second half of the year , Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said in a statement on Tuesday . 
strong manufacturing investment commitments , which reached a record of Singapore $ 8.1 billion during the year , should mean the republic has no difficulty making steady growth of five to seven percent next year , Goh said . 
in his New Year message to Singaporeans , Goh said inflation had remained low at around 1.3 percent while wages grew by 6.1 percent . 
&quot; Incomes increased faster than the cost of living as they have done for many years , &quot; Goh said . 
Singapore faces a general election on January 2 , where the rising cost of living has become one of the key issues . 
Singapore &apos;s 1996 growth was in line with official and market forecasts although at mid-year before the electronics slump the government had forecast growth of between 7.5 and 8.5 percent . 
the 1996 outcome also represents a slowdown from the 8.8 percent growth rate of 1995 and the double digit growth rates of the previous two years .
