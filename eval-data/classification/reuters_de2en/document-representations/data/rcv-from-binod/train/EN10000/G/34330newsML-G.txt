Russian President Boris Yeltsin has recorded a television interview to be shown later on Thursday in which he speaks about U.S. air raids on Iraq and the latest peace deal with Chechen rebels , Ria news agency said . 
Ria reported that Yeltsin said in the interview he intended to raise the issue of the U.S. air raids during his meeting with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , which is scheduled for Saturday at Yeltsin &apos;s country residence , where he is taking a holiday . 
the presidential press service said earlier on Thursday that Yeltsin backed his government in denouncing the raids . 
Yeltsin also spoke about the peace deal which his security chief Alexander Lebed signed with Chechen separatists last week . 
Yeltsin has not expressed an opinion on the deal yet . 
Yeltsin has stayed out of the public eye since late June and aides , who deny speculation of bad health , say the president needs a rest after an exhausting re-election campaign in which he won a second term in the Kremlin on July 3 .
