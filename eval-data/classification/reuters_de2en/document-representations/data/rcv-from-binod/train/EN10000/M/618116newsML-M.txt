dealers were looking for precious metals markets to consolidate on Tuesday after a quiet start to the week when the London and U.S. markets were closed for a holiday . 
gold was indicated at $ 343.80 / $ 343.30 , unchanged from Friday and barely moved from Monday &apos;s trading in Europe . 
early business was quiet and dealers forecast that it would hold narrowly around current prices . 
silver was also barely changed following its short-covering rally late on Friday and a quiet day on Monday . 
consolidation around $ 4.70 was expected , which would be about four-six cents below Friday &apos;s close . 
platinum and palladium were both steady , with the former forming a base either side of $ 390.00 and palladium at $ 171.00 / $ 172.00 .
