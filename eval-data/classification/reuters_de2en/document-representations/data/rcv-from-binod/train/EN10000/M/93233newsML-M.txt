the steep backwardation across the price curve in IPE gas oil futures will continue to support the market early in the fourth quarter after outright prices hit 5-1 / 2 year highs on Thursday , analysts and traders said . 
but their views were divided for deeper into winter after a rally of nearly $ 45 or 23 percent in the last month alone . 
how much the arrival of heating oil cargoes from North America can dent the backwardation in prices was also uncertain . 
&quot; Every time we don &apos;t build stocks in the U.S. , we won &apos;t build in Europe , &quot; said Bo Van Wijk , vice president in energy risk management at UBS in Zurich . 
&quot; The problem is if the U.S. is going to export product they &apos;re not going to build stocks . 
&quot; By exporting the oil they will import the potential problem , &quot; he said . 
this comes on top of a strategy by oil companies that one analyst referred to as kill -- keep inventories lean and low -- that raises demand for immediate supplies but widens the backwardation and discourages inventory building . 
the October 1 deadline for changing the sulphur content of diesel to 0.05 PCT has also contributed to tightness in the higher sulphur gas oil , analysts said . 
&quot; If we go into winter with a similar stock situation we could easily see $ 30- $ 40 backwardation a month , &quot; in the Jan / Feb , Feb / Mar and Mar / APR spreads , said Van Wijk . 
with the October expiring next Thursday , the Oct / Nov backwardation was trading near $ 13.00 late Thursday . 
the nearby-to-second-month spread ballooned to roughly $ 23.50 in March and then narrowed to minus $ 3 in May . 
OCT gas oil was $ 3.25 higher at $ 246.50 a tonne after rising to $ 247 , the highest since prices hit $ 352 in February 1991 . 
Charles Gray , analyst at prudential Bache , said a next target was $ 248.25 , roughly a 50 percent retracement of the Gulf war high at $ 363 to a post-Gulf War low in 1994 near $ 133.75 . 
consumer stocks in Germany , which accounts for about one-third of European demand , were about 62 percent of capacity at the end of August , eight percent below normal , Van Wijk said . 
he also said that stocks rarely build more than one percentage point from end-August to end-October , so the prospects are bleak for inventories to catch up there . 
&quot; inevitably , the avalanche of material that is coming into Europe has to take the edge off people &apos;s needs and once that happens we &apos;re not going to see the same intensity , &quot; said Mari Buglass , senior European oil analyst at Smith Barney in London . 
&quot; After we get through the first half of October it will be difficult for gas oil to sustain the ferocity of the upward move , &quot; she added , while acknowledging that prices were still vulnerable to further gains ahead of October &apos;s expiry . 
total middle distillate stocks in Europe at the end of August were 286.3 million barrels , down from 312.1 million a year ago , according to Euroilstock data . 
Paul Horsnell , assistant director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies , said prices were more vulnerable to a price spike due to the low stock cover and steep backwardation . 
&quot; ( But ) I think it &apos;s far too early in early October to start seriously predicting what &apos;s going to happen in the late fourth quarter or first quarter , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s not clear what the Asian market is going to look like and we have to sort out the spec change .
