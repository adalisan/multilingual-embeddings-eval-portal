India , unsure how U.S. President Bill Clinton would react to New Delhi &apos;s global nuclear standoff during a second term in office , played down his re-election on Wednesday . 
but officials said the defeat of Republican Senator Larry Pressler in Tuesday &apos;s national polls gave them at least one reason to mourn the verdict . 
Pressler was regarded as a key ally because of his opposition to U.S. arms sales to New Delhi &apos;s archfoe Pakistan . 
&quot; Pressler &apos;s defeat will be felt seriously in India , &quot; a senior Indian diplomat told Reuters . 
&quot; As for President Clinton , we have to see how he approaches our ties in his second term . 
Indian officials said apart from the expected formal official greetings to Clinton , there was little that Indian leaders were expected to say on his victory . 
&quot; We &apos;ll have to take a positive view . 
India never took sides in any U.S. election , &quot; a foreign ministry official said . 
&quot; So we &apos;ll hope for the best . 
&quot; We have our problems with the U.S. , much of which arose during the run-up to the ( U.S. ) election . 
the new administration will get more time to look into that , &quot; said Rasheed Talib , an independent political analyst . 
state-run Doordarshan television reported Clinton &apos;s victory without comment . 
the news was the third main story , behind one on the framing of criminal cheating charges against former prime minister P.V. 
Narasimha Rao on Wednesday . 
in his first term Clinton pointedly declined to criticise India for alleged human rights abuses in Kashmir and for pursuing a nuclear weapons programme . 
but that did not deter Washington from keeping the pressure on New Delhi on both fronts . 
India , regarded as a threshold nuclear power , has refused to sign the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty or the recently introduced Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) , on both occasions against U.S. advice . 
U.S. diplomats have hailed the recent opening of the Indian economy under Rao &apos;s sweeping reforms as a key factor in their improving ties .
