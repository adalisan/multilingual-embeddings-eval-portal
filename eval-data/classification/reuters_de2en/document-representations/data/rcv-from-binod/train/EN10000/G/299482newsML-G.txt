the U.N. Security Council decided to vote on Friday on a resolution authorising 155 peacekeepers for Guatemala despite China &apos;s vow to veto the measure . 
U.N. officials announced that President Hisashi Owada of Japan would to call a meeting later on Friday although China said it would kill the measure because of Guatemala &apos;s ties to Taiwan , which Beijing considers a rebel province . 
Beijing has used its veto only twice in the Security Council since it unseated Taiwan and took its seat in 1971 . 
one was on August 25 , 1972 to block the membership of Bangladesh in the United Nations and the second was shortly afterwards , on September 10 , in connection with an amendment to a Middle East resolution . 
Chinese and Guatemalan envoys have been negotiating for the past month , with Guatemala having sent a letter on the issue which Chinese envoys said was unsatisfactory . 
Guatemala has diplomatic relations with Taiwan , which gives it considerable economic aid . 
the resolution , sponsored by the United States among others , would allow the U.N. military observers to go to Guatemala for three months as part of a U.N.-brokered peace plan signed on Dec . 29 in Guatemala City . 
Guatemala &apos;s ambassador to Washington , Pedro Lamport , told reporters : &quot; If China decides to veto , it is their decision and their responsibility to the world . 
we have been extremely flexible ( but ) We are not going to change our friendship with Taiwan .
