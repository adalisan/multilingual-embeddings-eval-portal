the Australian share market came near to setting a record closing high on Friday after major resource issues were buoyed by stronger metal prices . 
the key share market barometer , the All Ordinaries index , ended 13.3 points higher at 2,336.8 , just 3.8 points short of its record closing high of 2,340.6 . 
the December share price index contract ended 12 points up at 2,359 and at a 22.2 point premium to the underlying index . 
brokers said investors were encouraged by a rally in copper and aluminium prices on Thursday with rises by key blue chip resource groups BHP , CRA and WMC underpinning the market &apos;s gain . 
&quot; I think it was a fairly admirable performance from the market today given there were no positive leads from offshore equity markets , &quot; a dealer from a Brisbane-based brokerage said . 
the dealer said decent gains by most base metals on the London Metal Exchange was the principal factor behind the market &apos;s rise , particularly the price of copper which he said was starting to show signs of stability after a prolonged fall . 
&quot; BHP lost ground at the end of the day but its strength for most of the session gave the market a good deal of confidence , &quot; the dealer said . 
brokers said U.S. inflation and retail sales data due out later today could have a big impact on Wall Street which would likely set the direction of Australian shares early next week . 
the stock of food and beverage group Coca-Cola Amatil continued to run higher with dealers citing the company &apos;s alliance with Malaysian tycoon , Robert Kuok and a roadshow by senior executives as the main reasons for its outperformance . 
gold miner Plutonic Resources was another outstanding issue , the company &apos;s stock continuing to rise strongly after it announced a significant discovery at its Darlot gold mine in Western Australia .
