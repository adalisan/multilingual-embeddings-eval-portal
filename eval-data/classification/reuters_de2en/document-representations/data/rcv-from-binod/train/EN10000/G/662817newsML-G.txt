Ernie Els won a nerve-wracking war of attrition at Congressional Country Club on Sunday , leaving behind three battered rivals on the final holes to win his second U.S. Open championship . 
Els , Colin Montgomerie , Tom Lehman and Jeff Maggert waged an intense struggle for control of the championship . 
but in the end the smooth-swinging , easy-going South African emerged with a one-shot win to claim the silver trophy and $ 465,000 . 
&quot; It is always a war on the golf course , and this time I won , &quot; said the 27-year-old Els . 
&quot; It was great competition out there today . 
it was really tough . 
in a gruelling final 18 holes that saw four-way ties for the lead at three different stages , the broad-shouldered South African made five successive pressure-packed pars down the stretch , and one by one his challengers failed to keep pace . 
&quot; That must have made great viewing for the TV audience , &quot; said Montgomery afterwards . 
Els , who won the 1994 Open in a three-way playoff at Oakmont , survived the test with a one-under 69 for a winning total of four-under 276 on the longest course to stage a U.S. Open . 
Montgomerie , who has come agonizingly close to winning a first major championship several times , including losing in the playoff to Els in 1994 , finished second . 
the Briton dropped out of a tie with playing partner Els when he missed a five-foot putt at the 17th hole and made bogey . 
Lehman , who has led going into the final U.S. Open round three years in a row without a win to show for it , bogeyed 16 and 17 , where he fired at flags in search of birdies . 
&quot; I &apos;m bitterly disappointed I didn &apos;t pull it off , &quot; said reigning British Open champion Lehman , who began the round with a two-shot lead . 
he shot 73 to finish third at two under . 
they were the only players to better par for the championship . 
Maggert , also gunning for his first major victory , was tied for the lead after his 12th hole , but bogeyed 13 and dissolved at the end , making bogey / double bogey / bogey the last three holes to finish fourth at one over par . 
Montgomerie said he cried after the last hole . 
&quot; Having come close , so close , you do get emotional about the thing , &quot; said the 33-year-old Scot , who also lost in a playoff against Steve Elkington for the 1995 PGA Championship . 
Montgomerie tried to maintain his composure after squandering another great chance to win a major . 
&quot; If I keep knocking on the door enough , the door will one day open . 
but this major business is getting me down now , &quot; he admitted . 
&quot; Ernie was frightfully calm out there and that &apos;s what you need to win this tournament . 
his nature helps him in these situations . 
Els never rattled and time and again saved himself from trouble in the wild scramble . 
there was one four-way tie , two three-way ties and three different individual leaders during the front nine alone . 
two more times on the back nine all four players were knotted . 
Els joined the other three at four under par by chipping in for birdie at the 10th hole . 
two holes later he seized the lead with his birdie at 12 . 
he dropped back into another three-way tie for the lead with a bogey at the 13th , where he hit his approach into heavy rough behind the green and above the hole . 
Els tried to chip out but the ball only advanced about a foot , leaving him on the fringe . 
he took two putts , the first using the leading edge of his wedge , to get down . 
from there , Els played solid and safe as the other brilliant contenders began to fade . 
Lehman and Montgomerie both lost their last chances at the 17th . 
Montgomerie hit his approach to the hole far to the right and into some rough . 
he pitched out softly and ran the ball to within five feet , but missed the crucial putt for par . 
after bogeying 16 to fall one shot behind , Lehman decided to shoot for the flag at the 17th , where the pin was placed back and left , hard by the water . 
Lehman &apos;s approach landed two yards short of his target . 
it bounced on the bank in front of the green and rolled back into the water . 
&quot; I would give anything in the world for a Mulligan , &quot; said Lehman , using the casual golfer &apos;s term for a do-over . 
Els triumphed with a pair of pars at the end . 
he hit a brilliant approach at 17 that set up a par , and a safe tee shot to the middle of the par-3 green at 18 . 
he ran his first putt five feet past . 
but unlike Montgomerie , Els sank his critical five-footer in the heart of the cup for victory . 
&quot; It was one of the most difficult holes of my life , &quot; Els said of the 18th . 
&quot; The one ( par ) at 17 was really a great one . 
besides the battle over the final 18 holes , the foursome were among 21 players who had to return to Congressional at 7 a.m. ( 1100 GMT ) Sunday morning to complete the third round , interrupted Saturday by a thunderstorm . 
Els hauled himself into contention with birdies on three of the five holes he had to play in the early morning hours . 
the laid-back Els said his easy going demeanor did not mean he was immune to the pressure . 
&quot; Maybe my exterior outside is very calm , &quot; Els said . 
&quot; I think inside any player will tell you that you &apos;re pretty intense and tense . 
&quot; Winning the U.S. Open doesn &apos;t come easy , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Coming down the stretch it just gets tougher and tougher .
