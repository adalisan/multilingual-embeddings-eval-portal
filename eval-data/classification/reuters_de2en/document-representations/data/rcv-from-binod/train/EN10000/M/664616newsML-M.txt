Belgian government bonds ( OLOs ) and futures are holding steady on expectations that EU leaders will do their job and agree on a European jobs pact at their two-day Amsterdam summit without raising spending . 
&quot; Markets have discounted a compromise ... any further positive impact should be limited , &quot; an analyst said . 
but another said , &quot; Agreement in Amsterdam should help the long end . 
most traders , however , said any enthusiasm about an Amsterdam deal on jobs had been tempered by indications that France would not hold up ratification of the post-euro stability pact in the absence of outspoken EU commitments on job creation . 
&quot; Positions have already been taken up , &quot; a trader , noting Monday morning volume was meagre . 
&quot; The market is not nervous . 
&quot; 5.75 percent should be a selling point for OLOs , &quot; a trader , noting the paper had risen near two full points from the end of May , justifying some profit-taking . 
before investors would take action , however , they would want to see more U.S. data US-MCE to determine whether further support might come from treasuries . 
U.S. CPI and industrial output figures are due on Tuesday and are expected to confirm that U.S. interest rates will be on 
once the U.S. data are out of the way , the focus will swing back to European issues , an analyst said . 
&quot; Even if an agreement is reached ( in Amsterdam ) , uncertainty will remain over Germany &apos;s ability to reduce its budget deficit below three percent of GDP ... this would increase the chances of a weaker EMU as Germany will be unable to prevent other countries which do not meet the budget criterion from participating in the first wave , &quot; he said . 
however , only a major disagreement over the future of EMU would spark an outspoken sell-off in the core bond markets , he added . 
the chances of that happening were slim , making OLOs a &apos; hold &apos; for now .
