LIFFE cocoa futures were tightly mixed by the close on Thursday in routine switch activity by locals and trade with the market taking a breather after the recent rally . 
&quot; It is taking time off , &quot; said one trader . 
the funds which have built up large long positions were unlikely to initiate new buying unless prices move much higher , origins were well hedged and manufacturers stepped up coverage recently . 
&quot; This leaves the locals and the trade jobbing the market , &quot; he said . 
benchmark September rose to hit a high of 1,150 stg a tonne before finishing the day at 1,137 , the same as previous close . 
its intraday low was 1,135 . 
prices advanced early in the session but drifted back after failing to trigger key stops . 
&quot; It pulled back as nothing appeared on the upside , &quot; another said . 
December was just one stg down at 1,139 . 
technically , while the 1,100 stg level basis September remained intact , there was also scope for the market to blip higher to 1,172 , analysts said . 
the funds might renew their buying at above 1,172 and this would pave the way for a challenge at 1,200 . 
the downside was seen well supported with a lot of buyers waiting on the dips . 
&quot; There could be some ( downward ) corrective element but it could come back again , &quot; said one . 
in another story , Barry Callebaut , the company created through a merger between cocoa firms cacao Barry SA and Callebaut AG , has been approved by a Belgian appeals court . 
the decision will mean that Barry Callebaut will sell a portion of the rights , and the production of Belgium-based cacao Goemaere to Chocolaterie Jacques , it said .
