the director of the Nairobi-based U.N. Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) on Sunday announced a &quot; revitalisation action plan &quot; in response to international criticism of its performance and financial controls . 
Wally N &apos;Dow said in a press statement the plan to meet what he termed &quot; constructive criticism &quot; of Habitat &apos;s administrative and financial performance was aimed at more efficient fund-raising , tighter control of spending , and a more efficient and transparent financial reporting system . 
he said it provided for restructuring Habitat , which is responsible within the U.N. system for improvement of all aspects of housing , especially in the developing world . 
N &apos;Dow , said the plan stressed greater participation by Habitat staff and stronger training . 
he called it part of an overall U.N. reform process . 
N &apos;Dow had earlier rejected as &quot; incorrect in facts and judgement &quot; a scathing U.N. report that said Habitat urgently needed a financial and policy overhaul to survive . 
the report by the U.N. office of Internal Oversight Services led by Karl Paschke of Germany said Habitat had few financial controls , hired unneeded consultants , assigned staff to tasks they did not perform and functioned in a muddled organisational and policy structure . 
&quot; Allowing the current state of affairs to persist for any length of time into the future would be reprehensible . 
accordingly , the situation of Habitat is serious and should not be allowed to continue , &quot; the report said . 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan agreed with the findings , his spokesman Fred Eckhard said . 
a separate report commissioned by Uganda , South Africa , Denmark and the Netherlands into Habitat also spoke of problems in management , especially financial resources . 
the Habitat Centre was set up after the first U.N. conference on human settlements , in Vancouver , Canada , in 1976 .
