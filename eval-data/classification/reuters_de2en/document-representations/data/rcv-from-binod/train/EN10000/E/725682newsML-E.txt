Colombia &apos;s central government budget deficit is set to rise to about 5 percent of gross domestic product in 1998 , while the consolidated public sector fiscal deficit grows to 3 percent of GDP , a central bank director forecast Monday . 
Salomon Kalmanovitz , one of the bank &apos;s seven top officials , coupled his gloomy prediction with a call to the government to fight harder to balance the budget . 
last year the central government deficit was running at 4.1 percent of GDP while the consolidated public sector deficit , excluding privatizations , was about 2 percent of GDP . 
&quot; The government must cut the fiscal deficit by reining in all costs that don &apos;t boost production , &quot; Kalmanovitz told a forum entitled &quot; How to reactivate the Economy &quot; , hosted by the El Tiempo newspaper . 
&quot; The adjustment must be made over a three to four year period by financing the deficit with more domestic loans and less foreign credit , &quot; he added . 
Kalmanovitz &apos;s comments coincided with the latest report issued by investment analysts Santander Investment . 
it forecast central government deficit would grow to 5.4 percent of GDP in 1997 against the backdrop of declining tax revenues because of the on-going recession . 
it said the deficit would remain above 5 percent in 1998 . 
&quot; Given sluggish growth , we expect tax revenues as a percentage of GDP to fall . 
efforts to pare back spending have basically fallen on the investment budget , which should decline from 1996 levels while we expect current spending to continue well ahead of inflation , &quot; the report said . 
&quot; The deficit is also being exacerbated by the growing interest burden and we forecast a federal deficit of 5.4 percent of GDP this year , &quot; it concluded . 
in his speech to the forum , Kalmanovitz said his deficit forecast could even be superseded if the government did not cut its preliminary net foreign income estimates . 
Colombia is scheduled to take on $ 1.7 billion in new foreign debt this year , less than the $ 2.1 billion originally estimated , but the figure is set to rise to $ 2 billion in 1998 . 
at the same time , Kalmanovitz said total income from oil exports was likely to be about $ 4.5 billion in 1998 . 
he estimated the government would earn $ 1.5 billion from its on-going privatization program this year and a further $ 600 million next year just from the sale of state coal mining company Carbocol . 
&quot; It &apos;s very important for the government to take a hard look at foreign debt forecasts for next year and for all state entities to cut back their forecasts , &quot; he said .
