Israeli unlinked bonds and Makams closed sharply higher on Sunday after the release of a lower-than-expected January consumer price index ( CPI ) , traders said . 
indices : 
* Government bonds general : + 0.05 PCT to 103.03 
* CPI-linked government bonds : + 0.01 PCT to 103.01 
* Unlinked government bonds ( Gilon -- issued for four years ) : + 0.19 PCT to 102.90 
* Dollar-linked government bonds : -0.01 PCT to 103.40 
* Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills : + 0.12 PCT to 102.00 
volume was low at 115 million shekels with activity in unlinked bonds rising sharply to 58 million shekels . 
January CPI , released on Friday , rose 0.4 percent , compared with an 0.8 percent increase in December . 
the January index was slightly under estimates by government and private sector economists , who had forecast a rise of about 0.5 percent . 
&quot; Bonds rose broadly following the release of the lower-than-expected CPI but volume was relatively low , &quot; said Danniella Finn at Batucha Securities and Investments . 
&quot; We saw very heavy trading in CPI-linked bonds despite the fact that they were today in the shadow of unlinked bonds , &quot; said Gidi Halperin , investment manager at Meitav Investments and Securities . 
&quot; Trading opened with very strong demand for unlinked bonds and Makams , with demand for the Makam rising to 380 million shekels , &quot; Halperin said . 
&quot; In the end , total turnover was only 22 million shekels , which is relatively low . 
Unlinked bonds and Makams rose sharply because investors are now predicting that the Bank of Israel will lower its base rate by 0.3 percentage points to 14.1 percent , Finn added . 
Dollar-linked bonds closed almost unchanged on low volume . 
note : Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year . 
the Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity .
