South Africa &apos;s money market shortage dipped fractionally on Monday but reamined above the nine billion rand mark at 9.110 billion , the Reserve Bank said on Tuesday . 
the shortage stood at 9.191 billion on Saturday . 
the high shortage , reflecting a liquidity squeeze in the wake of the latest sell-off in the rand and South African assets , has fuelled fears of a hike in interest rates . 
short-term rates , which were marked up sharply on Monday , are already more than discounting a one percentage point increase in the key Bank rate , currently 16 percent . 
on Tuesday , commercial banks held their three-month NCD rates steady at between 16.90 and 17.10 percent , while the 90-day BA rate was unchanged at 16.25 to 16.45 percent . 
money market traders said pressure on liquidity would continue until around the end of January as Christmas spending was likely to exacerbate the situation .
