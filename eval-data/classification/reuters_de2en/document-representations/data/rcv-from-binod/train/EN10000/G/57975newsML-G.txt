Bosnia &apos;s Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic is poised to emerge as head of the new collective presidency on Wednesday after the internationally-supervised , post-war election , but hardline Serbs are indicating they will find this hard to swallow . 
the fledgling Balkan state , anxious to learn who will lead it after more than three years of war , will have to wait until later on Wednesday for the final results of vote counting in the pivotal poll . 
early returns showed voters had hoisted wartime Serb and Croat hardliners back into power with large majorities alongside Izetbegovic in the inter-ethnic presidency . 
but the 70-year-old Moslem leader looked almost certain to head the three-member executive by winning the most votes over the leading Serb and Croat candidates . 
this means , under the Dayton peace agreement , that he will chair the joint presidency , and represent it abroad . 
the presidency must govern by consensus . 
by late on Tuesday , Izetbegovic led the two men with whom he will share the leadership -- Momcilo Krajisnik of the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Croat candidate Kresimir Zubak . 
both are nationalists who established unbeatable leads over their more moderate rivals . 
despite Krajisnik &apos;s reputation as a hard-line separatist , Western diplomats and Bosnian Serb sources said they expected him to cooperate in a new power-sharing arrangement designed to reintegrate Bosnia after 43 months of war . 
but Serbs living in the hardliners &apos; stronghold of Pale just east of Sarajevo declared they would never accept a Moslem as their leader . 
&quot; He ( Izetbegovic ) will never be my president , &quot; said 62- year-old Milan , a Pale market seller with a grim expression . 
&quot; After all , we fought this war against Moslems . 
now we cannot allow ourselves to be dominated by one &quot; . 
others in the market blamed Krajisnik &apos;s main challenger , Mladen Ivanic , who snatched almost a third of the Serb votes , for weakening the war-time parliamentary speaker &apos;s position . 
diplomats said Ivanic &apos;s strong showing was a backlash against Serb ultra-nationalists who tore Bosnia apart and got rich in war while most compatriots sank into penury . 
but one 80-year-old woman shopping amongst the street vendors described Ivanic and his supporters as traitors . 
&quot; To hell with democracy if we must have a Moslem for our president , &quot; she exclaimed . 
&quot; We have to blame this so-called opposition here ... that Ivanic character , and my guess is that he &apos;s an evil thrown among us to make us weaker . 
he stole the votes from Krajisnik . 
&quot; Krajisnik and only Krajisnik is our president , &quot; she said . 
Jelena Nikic , 33 , agreed : &quot; The West always finds a way to plant a seed of hatred among Serbs ... Izetbegovic &apos;s presidency would bring only misfortune to the Serbs . 
still , there &apos;s always a way - another war ! 
Izetbegovic &apos;s SDA party , though Moslem nationalist in tone , professes support for restoring a tolerant multi-ethnic Bosnia . 
despite apparent resistance to the idea from hardline Serbs , Bosnia &apos;s outgoing Moslem-led republic government was confident U.S. pressure on the Serbs would ensure joint government got off the ground . 
the United States said it would work with Bosnia &apos;s election victors over the next month or so , to set up joint governing bodies and then decide whether NATO forces should remain . 
a 53,000-strong NATO-led force separated and demobilised Bosnia &apos;s factional armies early this year in a key pre-election step mandated by the Dayton treaty . 
a team of OSCE-affiliated international observers has pronounced the elections free of serious irregularities in a preliminary report expected to lead to certification of the vote by Frowick later this month .
