Kurdish militia leader Jalal Talabani arrived in Turkey for talks with a U.S. mediator on Tuesday on ending infighting in northern Iraq that has hurt Washington &apos;s anti-Baghdad efforts . 
diplomatic sources said U.S. peace envoy Robert Pelletreau would try to convince Talabani to accept a ceasefire proposal that was also put to rival Iraqi Kurd chieftain Massoud Barzani . 
&quot; ( Talabani ) arrived in Istanbul from Tehran last night , &quot; said Shazad Saib , Turkey representative of Talabani &apos;s Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) . 
Washington , which has kept Iraqi President Saddam Hussein out of north Iraq for most of the last five years , fears Baghdad or Tehran might fill a power vacuum caused by the Kurdish feud . 
Pelletreau laid out the ceasefire plan at a meeting with Barzani in the Turkish border town of Silopi on Monday . 
&quot; ( Barzani ) was positive on the ceasefire . 
very positive , &quot; a source close to the talks told Reuters . 
but the U.S. bid has yet to produce a let up in fighting . 
neither side has gained a clear advantage in the latest clashes which broke out 10 days ago . 
Turkish officials said Talabani would meet Turkey &apos;s Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller around 4 p.m. ( 1600 GMT ) and then hold talks with Pelletreau . 
the PUK on Monday halted a push by Barzani &apos;s fighters on Talabani &apos;s stronghold Sulaimaniya , near the Iranian border . 
witnesses said forces loyal to Talabani retook the town of Ranya and repelled a KDP assault on the strategic Dukan Dam . 
&quot; PUK forces are continuing their victorious counter-attack against Barzani mercenaries , &quot; the group said in a statement . 
it said the PUK had also taken the towns of Sangasar and Zharawa . 
Kurdish fighting in August gave Saddam the chance to flex his muscles in the north , under nominal protection of a U.S.-led allied air force since after the end of the 1991 Gulf War . 
Barzani called in support from Iraqi armoured troops to overwhelm Talabani &apos;s forces in Arbil , the region &apos;s capital . 
the United States launched missiles at military targets in south Iraq in reprisal but still lost much of its aid , intelligence and military capability in the north . 
Barzani has since threatened to call on Iraqi help again if the fighting does not go his way . 
Pelletreau cautioned against any more Iraqi involvement and warned neighbouring Iran to stay out of the Kurds &apos; fight . 
&quot; The United States would regard that as a negative development that could have very negative consequences , &quot; he said after meeting Barzani on Monday . 
the KDP accuses Talabani of receiving men and munitions from Tehran , raising the spectre of a Iran-Iraq conflict . 
Talabani and Tehran deny military cooperation .
