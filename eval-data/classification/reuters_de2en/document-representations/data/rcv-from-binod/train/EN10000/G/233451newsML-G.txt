former Barcelona coach Johan Cruyff has decided not to press slander charges against club president Jose Luis Nunez , who attacked him in a news conference the day after the Dutchman &apos;s dismissal last May . 
Nunez alleged Cruyff had favoured his son Jordi ahead of other squad members and forced players back into action when they were injured . 
Cruyff and Barcelona are still engaged in a separate legal dispute over wages .
