the Sri Lankan rupee was depressed against the dollar in early Wednesday trade as banks used cheap call money to buy the greenback , dealers said . 
at 0445 GMT the rupee was at its opening level of 58.72 to the dollar . 
&quot; speculators are making use of low call money rates to build dollar positions , &quot; said a Union Bank dealer . 
&quot; It is not import covering demand that is keeping the dollar at current levels , because banks already have enough of the currency to meet commercial demand . 
the Central Bank left the dollar-rupee exchange rate unchanged . 
buying and selling prices remained at 58.3506 and 59.5294 . 
overnight call money was at its opening level of 10 percent , after falling to 9.75 in early trade . 
dealers say banks will continue to build dollar positions if call money rates stay around present levels . 
&quot; With the dollar expected to firm overseas , it is a good level at which to build positions , &quot; said a Standard Chartered Bank dealer .
