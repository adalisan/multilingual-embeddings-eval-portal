edgy French soldiers moved onto the streets of Brazzaville , where fighting continued for a sixth day on Tuesday , to escort foreign nationals to the relative sanctuary of the French embassy for evacuation . 
convoys of civilian vehicles , driven by French , Lebanese and other expatriate volunteers , were protected by armoured cars as they moved to different parts of the city centre where foreigners were living . 
bloody street fighting between soldiers and militiamen loyal to President Pascal Lissouba and a political militia loyal to ex-president Denis Sassou Nguesso has ebbed and flowed through the city centre since Thursday . 
for several days the French have been venturing to different parts of the capital to rescue foreigners trapped by fighting . 
French embassy officials said between 700 and 800 foreigners were flown out of Brazzaville on Monday in Transall military transport planes to the Gabon capital Libreville . 
they said over 1,000 French citizens could still be in the Brazzaville area . 
a column of smoke rose near to the tower housing the offices of French oil company Elf Aquitaine , and the sound of heavy firing could be heard coming from there . 
almost 200 people were gathered on the French embassy lawn , while outside soldiers , including Foreign Legionnaires and marines , kept a close eye on skirmishing which at one stage erupted near the front gates of the embassy compound . 
&quot; I &apos;m just so relieved to be here in the embassy , &quot; said one Canadian woman who was beaten up by Congolese troops who spotted her trying to film them from her flat . 
some seemed more concerned about the dogs they had brought out than themselves . 
every time the sound of a shell landing outside reached the embassy one Russian couple threw themselves on their dachsund dogs to protect them . 
&quot; For us personally this has been a thousand times worse than when we were brought out of Rwanda in 1994 , &quot; said Leen Jakobs , a Belgian woman . 
from the embassy compound the foreigners will be taken to the airport , where the reinforced French contingent is based , and those who want to will be flown out to Libreville .
