the seven-year issue is non-callable , and was launched at 400 basis points over the underlying U.S. treasuries . 
the issuer is rated Ba3 by Moody &apos;s Investors Service and bb by Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s . 
while the Tjiwi Kimia deal attracted interest , bankers said they were looking forward to see the reception given to U.S. dollar deals by Indonesian state banks in coming months . 
in other news , bankers said Indonesian state banks might liven up the market . 
they had their borrowing allocations approved , but were coming to market in the wake of negative reports by Moody &apos;s Investors Service about the Indonesian state banking sector . 
one banker said the Indonesian state bank borrowings would be interesting , given Moody &apos;s report that it was revising its rating outlook for Indonesian state banks &apos; outlook to uncertain from stable . 
the change was made pending decisions on planned mergers in the Indonesian state bank sector , Moody &apos;s said . 
the state banks would also be putting a &quot; toe into the water &quot; in being the first de facto sovereign issues from Indonesia since the Indonesian rupiah came under speculative selling attack and was effectively devalued , bankers said . 
the first issues would show the pricing that the market expected post-devaluation . 
PT Bank Persero Negaro Indonesia is in the market with an innovative two-branch US $ 70 million borrowing for its Singapore and Hong Kong branches . 
bankers said the all-in at the top level was just under 50 basis points . 
news that Thailand was ready to talk with the International Monetary Fund was a welcome fillip to debt investors , who have seen several Thai bank deals either repriced or pulled entirely in recent weeks . 
&quot; I expect Thailand to be on a continuous growth path and to recover trust from the financial markets as it moves towards reaching agreement on such a programme , &quot; Japan &apos;s finance minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said . 
in principle , should Thailand request help , Japan would consider it seriously , he added . 
but despite good news about Thailand , dealers said investors were still skittish about Asian currencies . 
&quot; Today was a good example of how nervous people still are , &quot; said one dealer in Singapore . 
&quot; All the regionals followed the baht up this morning , but then some corporates said &apos; oh look , cheap dollars and everything came back .
