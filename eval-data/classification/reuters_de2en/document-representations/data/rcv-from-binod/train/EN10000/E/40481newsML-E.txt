Czech real industrial output in 
July grew by 15.6 percent compared with the same month in 1995 , 
but with three extra working days , the Czech Statistical Bureau 
said on Monday . 
that compares with a real , inflation adjusted , rise of just 
1.8 percent in June , a result which was skewed due to having 
two fewer working days than in the same month in 1995 . 
the bureau said last week that the extra days in July 
accounted for about 7.9 percentage points of the year-on-year 
increase . 
for the first seven months in 1996 , real industrial 
production has risen 9.1 percent , year-on-year , and real wages 
were up 8.2 percent . 
it said average nominal monthly wages grew 19.7 percent in 
July , year-on-year , compared with a 13.3 percent in June , with 
real wages 9.4 percent higher than the same month in 1995 . 
the average nominal industrial wage in July was 9,633 
crowns compared with 9,636 in June . 
the wage results sample companies with 100 or more 
employees while output results include estimates of smaller 
firms as well .
