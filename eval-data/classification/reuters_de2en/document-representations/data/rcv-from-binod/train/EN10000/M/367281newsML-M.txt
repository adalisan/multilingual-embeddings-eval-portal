Irish bonds continued to edge forward across the curve in thin late trade on Monday as the market awaited supply data both at home and from the U.S. , dealers said . 
&quot; It has been very quiet . 
supply is the focus for the rest of the week , &quot; one dealer said . 
at home , Tuesday sees Ireland &apos;s National Treasury Management Agency ( NTMA ) announce the amount and maturity of stock to be auctioned on February 18 . 
international investors will focus more on supply and less on data this week as the U.S. quarterly refunding , starting on Tuesday , is set to overshadow European and U.S. figures due later , analysts said . 
the U.S. Treasury surprised markets on Wednesday when it announced it will issue three , 10 and 30-year bonds worth a total of $ 39.75 billion dollars at the quarterly auctions , after Wall Street anticipated issues worth $ 37.5 billion . 
the auctions , scheduled for Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday , will see the issue of $ 17.75 billion dollars of three-year notes , $ 12.0 billion of 10-year notes and $ 10.0 billion of 30-year bonds respectively . 
by 1545 GMT , the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 had risen 25 pence from Friday &apos;s close at 103.30 to yield 5.66 percent while the key benchmark eight percent bond due 2006 had gained 17 pence from the close at 110.62 to yield 6.47 PCT . 
dealers said Irish bonds were trading 138 basis points over German bunds in the five-year area and 90 basis points over bunds in the 10-year area , compared with 152 basis points and 88 basis points respectively at the opening .
