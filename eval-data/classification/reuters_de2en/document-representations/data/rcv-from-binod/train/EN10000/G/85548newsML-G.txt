Afghanistan &apos;s Taleban Islamic militia on Monday asked the forces of northern warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum to allow its fighters passage into the north , but the demand was rejected , a Taleban commander said . 
a United Nations official visiting the area urged the Taleban to go to Dostum &apos;s people in friendship rather than war after the general &apos;s forces advanced to about three km ( two miles ) from those of Taleban , reporters visting the area said . 
it was not immediately clear whether the Taleban , who conquered the capital Kabul on Friday , wanted the passage through the famous Salang Highway to attack some northern provinces still held by forces loyal to ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani or wanted to capture Dostum &apos;s territory . 
Dostum has so far stayed away from the fighting between Taleban and the former Kabul government , which he also opposed . 
in recent months , Rabbani has been trying to strike an alliance with Dostum while Taleban also said after taking Kabul that it wanted to settle important matters with him through talks . 
Dostum &apos;s forces advanced several km ( miles ) south of the Salang tunnel on Monday as the Taleban asked for the passage , witnesses said . 
villagers in the area packed goods on trucks and buses and left northwards fearing a confrontation between the two forces . 
a Taleban commander , Mullah Ghulam Mohammad , told reporters the Taleban had asked Dostum &apos;s forces to make way for them , but the request had been rejected . 
&quot; We told them to let the Taleban cross because Dostum does not represent the north , &quot; he said .
