* Thai baht eases in offshore markets , forwards take sharp left on unsubstantiated rumour Thailand may soon lift controls on baht trading . 
* Malaysian ringgit falls on news of trade deficit and fading fears central bank will impose controls similar to Thailand &apos;s . 
* Indonesian rupiah firms as market braces for possible liquidity tightening after weekly tax payments . 
* Singapore dollar sluggish as even activity in ringgit / sing cross slows . 
the Thai baht slid in offshore markets on Friday on rumours Thailand may soon lift controls plugging the supply of baht funds to offshore parties and ending the two-tier baht market that has been in place since mid-May . 
&quot; There &apos;s been buying of dollar / baht on market talk there will be a neutralisation of the two-tier market . 
it could just be market talk . 
some U.S. funds seem to be spreading the rumours , &quot; a European bank dealer in Singapore said . 
Bank of Thailand ( Bot ) officials were not immediately available for comment . 
the baht was quoted at 24.500 / 24.700 to the dollar in the offshore market at 0430 GMT against 24.100 / 24.200 late on Thursday . 
it was at 25.800 / 25.810 in the domestic market , near the Bot &apos;s mid-rate of 25.79 . 
dealers said forwards had also moved sharply left in offshore markets , with the one-month swap premium at 75 / 90 satangs against 110 / 130 late on Thursday . 
&quot; Today , because of all these rumours , people are not willing to be caught short of dollar / baht . 
there &apos;s also a lot of giving interest in the forwards , &quot; the Singapore dealer said . 
he said reports the Bot was planning to revamp its forex system along the same lines as Singapore , which keeps a tight rein on trading of its currency , had not surprised the market . 
&quot; Some of the big players have been expecting this because Thailand is basically running out of ideas . 
Singapore &apos;s policy seems to work well ; when a currency is not tradeable , the chances of it being attacked are minimal , &quot; he said . 
Bot assistant governor Siri Ganjarerndee said on Thusday Thailand would use Singapore &apos;s forex regime as a model in developing its new exchange rate system . 
Siri said Singapore had succeeded in becoming a regional financial hub while controlling offshore supply of its currency . 
the Malaysian ringgit fell as players positioned themselves for the release of negative trade data . 
players also covered their short dollar positions as fears the Malaysian central bank would impose capital controls like those of Thailand faded . 
offshore players had sold dollar / ringgit aggressively on the rumours on Thursday after Bank Negara called for a meeting on Friday with chief executive officers of some banks . 
but banking sources said the meeting was to discuss routine foreign exchange activities . 
Malaysia &apos;s announcement of a 2.1 billion ringgit deficit in April against a surplus of 1.75 billion in March caused a brief spike in dollar / ringgit , but the upside was limited as the market was already long dollars , dealers said . 
&quot; There was buying ( of the dollar ) by U.S. funds from before lunch . 
it &apos;ll probably be a sell-on-the-fact scenario , &quot; the Singapore dealer said . 
he said dollar / ringgit was likely to remain confined between U.S. fund buying interest above 2.5080 and KL corporate sales around 2.5180 . 
the Indonesian rupiah firmed as players kept an eye on the liquidity outlook ahead of weekly tax payments due later in the day . 
dealers said the relatively ample supply in early trading softened short-dated swaps and helped longer-term swaps to ease . 
spot rupiah strengthened through the 2,427.0 resistance level to touch 2,426.25 briefly , before coming off to 2,427.0 / 29.0 at 0430 GMT . 
it opened at 2,426.75 / 27.75 . 
a U.S. bank dealer said some offshore players took profit on their forward positions but there was still a preference for remaining long on a possible spillover from rumours of swap restrictions in other centres .
