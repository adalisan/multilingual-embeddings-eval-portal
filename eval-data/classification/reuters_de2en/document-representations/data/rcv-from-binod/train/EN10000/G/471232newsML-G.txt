e-mail may threaten the business of other nations &apos; mail services but the Internet will probably never dent one of the world &apos;s smallest and most efficient post offices . 
as long as tourists come to Rome , and , barring a miracle to improve the efficiency of the snail &apos;s-paced Italian mail , the Vatican always will be able to boast what Romans and foreigners call &quot; the little post office that works &quot; . 
the Vatican Post Office , with only four offices and 70 employees , thrives by concentrating on old-fashioned efficiency over automation . 
mail sorting machines ? 
not here . 
electronic address scanners ? 
you &apos;ve got to be kidding . 
&quot; We don &apos;t have any really sophisticated machines , says Pope John Paul &apos;s Postmaster , Father Angelo Cordischi . 
that is an understatement . 
the most advanced technology in the main mail room of its tiny headquarters is a 30-year-old mechanical franking machine . 
even that is dusted off and oiled only during the peak tourist seasons to process postcards . 
&quot; sophisticated machines are very expensive for a small operation like ours and we really don &apos;t need them to be successful , &quot; Cordischi said in his office . 
his formal title -- The Inspector of the posts and Telegraphs of Vatican City State -- is longer than many of the messages on postcards his staff send speeding around the world . 
Cordischi says the Vatican post office works well precisely because its attention to detail has remained a priority and he is confident that it will be successful in the future . 
&quot; We are not threatened as much as everyone else by electronic communications . 
tourists will always want to buy Vatican stamps and send postcards , &quot; he said . 
the sorting room of the Vatican Post Office seems like the set of an old movie . 
the only thing missing is men with green eyeshades and sleeve protectors . 
departing or arriving mail is strewn on a large steel table and put by hand into rows and rows of decades-old pigeonholes that have taken on the sweet aroma of aged wood . 
the post office , which every year sends out 10 million pieces of mail and receives about half that amount , is cherished by Rome residents seeking more reliability and speed than that offered by Italy , on the other side of the &quot; border &quot; . 
&quot; The secret is simply that we are small and we are able to send our mail out every day and choose the quickest path , &quot; said Cordischi , 61 , a member of the Don Orione religious order . 
the Vatican post office traces its origins to the 14th century , when the Papal bureaucracy developed a system of horseback couriers to deliver official correspondence throughout the Papal States and Europe . 
today , a tiny , sovereign city-state of 108 acres ( 40 hectares ) , the Vatican has forged commercial deals with airlines to get its mail out . 
&quot; There is no mixing with the Italian post system for overseas mail and mail sent to Italian addresses enters the Italian system as close to the final destination as possible , &quot; Cordischi said . 
mail destined for North America , for example , is divided before it leaves the Vatican into neat bundles labelled New York City , New York State , Texas , Montreal , California and so on . 
it leaves the Vatican every night for Rome airport and is put on the first flightt to the closest regional destination . 
only then does it enter the local system . 
even mail that goes to Italy is sent directly by train to cities throughout the country , rather than entering the Italian system just beyond the Vatican &apos;s portals in Rome . 
&quot; We can &apos;t compete in volume but we can compete in quality precisely because we are a small operation , &quot; Cordischi said . 
mail is collected and delivered inside Vatican City three times a day -- compared to only once in Rome . 
there are some 30 blue mail boxes inside Vatican City and the Roman Catholic Church &apos;s extra-territorial buildings in Rome . 
two Vatican post offices are in St Peter &apos;s Square and another is in the Vatican museums . 
the fourth , the headquarters , is just inside a Vatican gate and is not open to tourists . 
Cordischi doesn &apos;t like to talk about money , saying the post office &quot; more or less breaks even &quot; . 
Italy &apos;s mail system , by contrast , is usually in the red and there is talk about privatising it . 
the Italian post is also subject to strikes , considered heritical at the Vatican . 
during the peak summer season and at holiday times like Christmas and Easter , the Italian post office cashes in on crowds and moves a mobile unit to the edge of St Peter &apos;s Square . 
&quot; We can &apos;t stop them from doing it . 
it &apos;s on Italian soil and we don &apos;t consider it competition that can really hurt us , &quot; Cordischi said . 
about 100 letters a day arrive at the Vatican post office addressed to Pope John Paul . 
the missives usually ask for his prayers or help to resolve a personal matter . 
to reach the world &apos;s Roman Catholic leader , even people who have access to the worldwide web have to use the Vatican Post Office . 
although the world is on the threshold of the third millennium and the Vatican has its own web site , you still can &apos;t e-mail the Pope directly . 
he still prefers pen and paper .
