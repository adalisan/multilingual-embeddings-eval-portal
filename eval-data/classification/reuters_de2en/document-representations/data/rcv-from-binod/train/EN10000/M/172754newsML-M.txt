Japanese government bond ( JGB ) and Euroyen futures fell sharply on Thursday after comments by a senior official at Japan &apos;s Ministry of Finance triggered fears of a possible rise in Japanese interest rates . 
Eisuke Sakakibara told a Japanese newspaper the U.S. dollar &apos;s recent rise may be over . 
then , in comments to Reuters , he added fuel to the fire by saying Japan &apos;s economy was stronger than the market thought . 
the remarks helped bring the dollar down to a low of 111.69 yen in late trade from 113.80 at the start of the Asian day . 
&quot; Euroyen and JGBs have fallen based on fears of rate rises , &quot; said a Singapore-based futures trader . 
&quot; A rate rise is seen possible either to contain stronger than expected economic growth , and possible inflation , or to support the yen . 
the dealer said the large falls showed a degree of panic selling by investors who had been caught long by the recent uninterrupted upswing in Japanese financial futures . 
by 1115 GMT , the lead June Euroyen contract was down nine ticks at 99.14 against its IMM close at 99.22 on very active volume of more than 39,000 lots . 
it earlier hit a low of 99.12 . 
JGB futures were even weaker , plunging 1.31 at one point to a low of 124.45 before recovering to end at 124.75 , down 1.01 . 
volume was active at 1,545 lots . 
dealers said the sharp fall was unlikely to be matched by an equally dramatic rally . 
&quot; It will probably take a day or two before buyers are ready to come back in , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; Unless there are some fresh comments , it will probably steady tomorrow . 
&quot; As far as JGBs are concerned , they are now at more realistic levels and ought to attract buyers . 
but it is hard to get anyone to buy them after what has happened today , &quot; he added . 
Eurodollar futures were only slightly weaker with dealers blaming profit-taking by the holders of long positions after the expected reelection of Bill Clinton as U.S. president on Tuesday . 
many of the sellers were U.S.-based , they said . 
these small-scale losses were likely to be recovered soon . 
&quot; If the rally in the U.S. ( stock market ) continues on the back of the election , I think Eurodollars could return to their highs , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; But most of the good news is built into the market now . 
the most active March 1997 Eurodollar contract closed at 94.44 , against its IMM close at 94.46 .
