Poland &apos;s current account gap , a dark spot in an otherwise healthy emerging economy , grew 10-fold in the first four months of this year and analysts said reversing this trend may take until 1998 at the earliest . 
&quot; The trend of a widening trade gap can only be reversed in 1998 at the earliest , &quot; said Krzysztof Bledowski , chief analyst at Woodcommerz in Warsaw . 
in the first months of 1997 the C / A deficit continued to expand quickly despite tight monetary measures taken to cool domestic demand , as import growth remained rampant while exports stalled along with Germany &apos;s slow economic recovery . 
&quot; Poland &apos;s trade gap could swell to about five percent of the gross domestic product in 1997 and even more in 1998 unless very tight monetary and fiscal policies are applied , &quot; said Krzysztof Rybinski , chief analyst at ING Bank in Warsaw . 
on Wednesday the National Bank of Poland figures showed the current account deficit at $ 2.27 billion in the January-April period , up from a $ 226 million gap in the same period of 1996 . 
analysts said that semi-annual debt interest payments by the Polish government contributed some $ 400 million to the country &apos;s $ 742 million C / A deficit in April . 
Poland &apos;s trade gap doubled to $ 4 billion in the first four months of 1997 , as exports increased eight percent compared to a 28 percent jump in imports . 
unofficial cross-border trade inflows , which in the past helped to balance Poland &apos;s external position , slipped by 29 percent to $ 1.75 billion mainly as a result of a strong zloty agains the German mark . 
analysts said exports would at most increase by about 10 percent in 1997 , not enough to reverse the troublesome trend of a growing current account deficit until 1998 at the earliest . 
they said the bleak trade deficit picture could brighten next year or in 1999 as the $ 10 billion worth of foreign direct investments made in Poland revamped the country &apos;s exports . 
&quot; Poland &apos;s economic growth attracts foreign capital , which is one of the reasons why Poland can avoid the crisis that the Czech Republic had earlier this year , &quot; said Julia Shvets , analyst at IDEA in London . 
the Czech Republic now finds itself in a deep rut with a falling currency and virtually no economic growth after it was forced into austere monetary measures as a result of a current account deficit , which reached 8.6 percent of GDP last year . 
analysts saw little room for a reduction in Polish interest rates or a cut in the zloty &apos;s devaluation constant until around the turn of the year as Polish authorities concentrate on keeping the current account from reaching critical levels . 
&quot; Inflation seems under control , which may allow the central bank to keep the zloty soft and rates high for most of this year , &quot; WoodCommerz &apos;s Blendowski said . 
industrial output is expected to remain strong despite high interest rates as improving productivity and investment keep production increasing in line with growing domestic demand . 
&quot; Industrial output will grow some 10 percent in the first half of the year , while investment has increased 24 percent in the first four months , so from the supply side the economy is in good shape , &quot; said Tadeusz Chroscicki , head analyst at the government &apos;s Centre for Strategic Studies ( CSS ) .
