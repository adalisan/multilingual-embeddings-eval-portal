Indonesian palm olein prices continued to fall in late trading on Wednesday on sustained weak demand , traders said . 
they said palm olein was quoted at 1,400-05 rupiah / kg in Jakarta , down from 1,410-15 rupiah at the opening , but offers were also heard at 1,395 rupiah . 
crude palm oil was last done at 1,241 rupiah / kg at a tender in Medan on Tuesday . 
&quot; Prices are continuing to fall , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; buying interest is very thin and sellers are cutting prices in a bid to attract buyers , who are waiting for further falls . 
traders said the steady fall in domestic palm olein prices was also linked to comparatively lower soyoil values , which led China to default on some 50,000 tonnes of palm oil this week . 
a Shanghai trader involved in the deal said China would replace the Malaysian palm oil , mostly for April delivery , with cheaper soyoil from South America . 
Malaysian palm oil prices fell sharply in late trading on Tuesday when the market got wind of the default . 
Indonesian traders said they were not surprised by news of the default as China had defaulted in the past . 
they said the move underlined the risks in doing business with China .
