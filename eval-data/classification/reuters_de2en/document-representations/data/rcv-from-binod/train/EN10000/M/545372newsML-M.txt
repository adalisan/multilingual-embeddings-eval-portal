Taiwan share prices were higher , but off from early highs , in late Monday trade as financials performed strongly to support the gains , brokers said . 
with 60 minutes left , the index was up 40.08 points or 0.46 percent at 8,701.80 . 
foods and plastics also rose , but electronics , the recent gainers , fell on profit-taking . 
&quot; Players try to buy financials to keep the upswing as recent bellwether electronics ( stocks ) turn weak , &quot; said HSBC James Capel analyst Alex Chen . 
&quot; But whether financials can become another bellwether sector or not remains to be seen , &quot; Chen said .
