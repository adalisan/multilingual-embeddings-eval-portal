the crew of space shuttle Columbia arrived at Florida &apos;s Kennedy Space Centre on Monday as countdown clocks began ticking toward Thursday &apos;s blastoff . 
&quot; Everything is coming together for a Thursday launch and we are just really looking forward to it , &quot; shuttle commander Jim Halsell said after arriving in Florida . 
the weather forecast for Thursday &apos;s blastoff looked favourable , shuttle meteorologist Ed Priselac said . 
he gave the shuttle an 80 percent chance of getting off the launch pad . 
Halsell and fellow astronauts Susan Still , Janice Voss , Don Thomas , Roger Crouch and Greg Linteris flew to Florida from their training base in Houston in T-38 training jets . 
the seventh crew member , Mike Gernhardt , was recovering from a stomach bug and arrived later in another aircraft . 
NASA spokeswoman Eileen Hawley said he was expected to make a full recovery before Thursday &apos;s launch . 
still , a 35-year-old Naval aviator , was to become only the second woman to occupy the shuttle &apos;s co-pilot &apos;s seat . 
Crouch and Linteris are guest scientists who specialise in microgravity research . 
NASA officials said there were no technical problems facing the launch team . 
the crew will be divided into two shifts to work around the clock in a European-built laboratory module , mounted in the shuttle &apos;s cargo bay . 
during the 16-day mission the astronauts are to light dozens of fires inside a protective enclosure for combustion research , grow protein crystals and manufacture new materials .
