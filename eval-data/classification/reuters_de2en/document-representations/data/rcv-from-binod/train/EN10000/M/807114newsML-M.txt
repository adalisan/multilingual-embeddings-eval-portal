Robusta coffee futures are still looking vulnerable after last week &apos;s losses and technical analysts said on Monday the benchmark November could well breach the psychological $ 1,500 suppport . 
traders called the market to open $ 47 down on numbers but added in practice , it could do $ 20- $ 30 lower . 
new York arabica coffee futures ended sharply lower on Friday as locals and speculators sold in anticipation of a build up in U.S. warehouse inventories during July . 
after the market had closed , the Green Coffee Association ( GCA ) of New York &apos;s monthly data showed a 219,000-bag increase in stocks against most expectations of 50,000 to 150,000 . 
on the charts , the London November contract could take out the important $ 1,500 support , said Elli Gifford , an independent technical analyst . 
the contract broke the previous key $ 1,600 support last week . 
next key support was pegged at $ 1,385 . 
upside potential remained limited , although the initial goal was seen at just above $ 1,540 . 
but Gifford said substantial resistance was at $ 1,640 , the peak seen early last week . 
broker GNI said the GCA news could create a sell off in New York at the start of this week , particularly as the U.S. technicals were now following the London lead and turning negative . 
&quot; However London has been predominantly sold off on the back of the slump in the Indonesian rupiah as the currency has floated , &quot; it said in a commentary on Monday . 
in other news , Vietnam &apos;s next coffee crop is expected to be a bumper one with yields of robusta and arabica reaching as much as 350,000 tonnes , according to the head of the Vietnam Coffee Corporation ( Vinacafe ) . 
TRAN Khai was quoted by the English-language Vietnam News on Saturday as saying the 1997 / 98 crop would be Vietnam &apos;s biggest so far .
