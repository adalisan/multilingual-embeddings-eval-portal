overnight guilders were unmoved on Thursday in a quiet market , with dealers confident the new special advances pact due to be announced at 1500 GMT would not involve a change in rates . 
Germany &apos;s Bundesbank said earlier it did not plan a news conference after its fortnightly council meeting , bolstering analysts &apos; views it will not adjust key interest rates . 
call rates were unchanged at 2.93 percent bid , although other prices eased slightly due to better-than-expected German February unemployment figures released earlier , dealers said . 
as a result long-term rates had held steady , they said . 
dealers said the finance ministry &apos;s agent had lifted the price of its DTC programmes due April , May and December 1997 to 3.05 , 3.05 and 3.16 percent respectively . 
the guilder was quoting at 112.51 per 100 marks , down a touch on Wednesday &apos;s 112.50 fixing .
