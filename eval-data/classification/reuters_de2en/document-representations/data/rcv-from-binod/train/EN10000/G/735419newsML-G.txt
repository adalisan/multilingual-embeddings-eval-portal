Bosnian Serb leaders issued a fresh protest on Thursday against a NATO swoop on indicted war criminals as the United States vowed to stick to the tougher approach to bring fugitives to justice . 
Serb leaders refused to attend a meeting of Bosnia &apos;s inter-ethnic central government in Sarajevo because they alleged that NATO could no longer be trusted to provide for the safety of their aides . 
the boycott was the latest protest from the hardline nationalist Serb leaders , who accuse NATO of overstepping its peacekeeping mandate by pouncing on two Serbs wanted for war crimes last week , shooting dead one and arresting the other . 
the boycott accompanied a wave of low-level violence targeting international monitors and NATO troops in apparent retaliation for the arrest operation . 
none of the incidents caused injuries . 
the United States envoy to Bosnia , Robert Gelbard , made clear that Washington would not back down from the more aggressive stance towards suspects wanted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in the Netherlands . 
&quot; If local authorities refuse to abide by their obligation to arrest indicted war criminals , we will continue to look for other ways to secure their capture , &quot; Gelbard said in written testimony for the U.S. Senate . 
Boro Bosic , the Serb co-prime minister , said the raid conducted by the NATO-led Stabilisation Force ( SFOR ) had &quot; seriously undermined &quot; the work of the post-war central government . 
&quot; Extreme insecurity is the last thing we expected from SFOR which is supposed to make us feel safe , &quot; Bosic was quoted as saying by Serb media . 
he said he feared for the safety of his staff in Sarajevo because NATO had acted on sealed , or secret , indictments last Thursday . 
SFOR was &quot; continuing a manhunt against innocent men which is based on alleged sealed lists , &quot; Bosic said . 
Western peace mediators dismissed the boycott as &quot; political game-playing &quot; and said the safety of Serb representatives was guaranteed by NATO troops deployed in Sarajevo , which lies inside Moslem-Croat federation territory . 
three hand grenades were lobbed at a car park in a British base in the Serb-controlled town of Banja Luka on Wednesday night , the fourth explosion in four days in apparent retaliation for the arrest operation . 
British soldiers fired warning shots and detained four suspects who were later turned over to local police . 
previous small-scale explosives detonated near the offices of international monitors in Serb territory . 
SFOR officers said privately no serious threat was posed by the explosions which caused no casualties . 
they said the incidents were a long way from the violence associated with terror campaigns in the Middle East or Northern Ireland . 
SFOR has received anonymous threats since the British special forces operation against the two Serb suspects last Thursday in Prijedor , near Banja Luka . 
both suspects were charged by the tribunal for leading a brutal &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; campaign against Moslems and Croats in the Prijedor region . 
although NATO said there was no orchestrated retaliation campaign , Balkan analysts said Serb nationalists were trying to test the political determination of Western powers just as they did during the 1992-95 Bosnian war . 
the Serbs , playing on Western reluctance to risk casualties , were hoping to force the West to back off plans to go after indicted war criminals , such as former Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic .
