when the announcement came over the public address system of a suburban-bound commuter train leaving Chicago Tuesday evening , few riders crinkled their newspapers or looked up from open books . 
&quot; Attention Cubs fans , &quot; the conductor said . 
&quot; It &apos;s 11 . 
hardly a magic number . 
few even asked , 11 what ? 
the Chicgo Cubs had lost their 11th consecutive game of the young baseball season , dropping to 0-11 to break the modern-day National League record for futility , as the Chicago Tribune described the dubious mark earlier in the day . 
the 10-7 loss to the Colorado Rockies was another footnote in baseball records for a team that has not won a national title in 89 years yet still -- at least when the sun rose Tuesday -- draws a loyal following among a hard core of fans who may prefer scorn to scoring . 
it was bad news during a chilly Chicago spring for school children facing inevitable class trips in bumpy yellow buses to wind-swept Wrigley Field where the hot chocolate is often warmer than the action . 
the Tribune , whose parent company owns the team , published a 12-step guide Tuesday to those aspiring to become a long-suffering Cubs fan . 
among those to blame , it suggested in Lesson No.4 , might the the Tribune Co. itself and anyone else who had a hand in letting ace pitcher Greg Maddux go . 
Maddux won three consecutive CY Young Awards as the National League &apos;s best pitcher for the Atlanta braves -- after winning his first with the Cubs , lest anyone suggest the Cubs didn &apos;t realise what they were losing . 
&quot; We &apos;re a lot better ball club than this , &quot; the Cubs Brian McRae told one evening television newscast . 
&quot; We ain &apos;t gonna lose another one , &quot; promised another player . 
if not , there are other records to conquor . 
the 1963 Cubs lost 103 games over the course of the season , finishing 41-1 / 2 games out of first place . 
and then there was the 1988 American League Baltimore Orioles . 
they lost their first 21 games that season , so the Cubs still have 11 losses to go before they can claim the major league mark for most miserable start .
