NYMEX electricity futures shrugged off sharply higher spot cash prices to settle lower in line with weaker natural gas futures , trade sources said Wednesday . 
&quot; I think the futures were reluctant to push in either direction with the gas storage report coming out , &quot; said one trader . 
a report late in the day of a slightly smaller-than-expected draw in natgas inventories put further downward pressure on natural gas prices just before the market close . 
nevertheless , the trader noted that the full impact of recent frigid weather in the Northwest and other parts of the U.S. may not show up in storage data until next week &apos;s report . 
market sources do not expect recent next-day California-Oregon and Mid-Columbia spot power prices of above $ 50 per megawatt hour ( MWh ) to hold , but said NYMEX futures are likely to react to the sharp run-up before expiration of the January contract later this month . 
January 1997 California-Oregon border ( COB ) futures ended down 25 cents at $ 27.00 per MWh , while the February contract was 19 cents lower at $ 20.31 . 
January Palo Verde closed down 50 cents at $ 27.75 , while February was unchanged at $ 21.00 and other PV contracts were down 5 to 25 cents .
