U.S. stock index futures finished higher with March Standard and Poor &apos;s 500 near session highs amid afternoon shortcovering . 
traders noted strength in technology issues and said resilience in the face of Treasury bond losses earlier in the day also helped fuel the recovery . 
&quot; It &apos;s a little bit of a rally after the market has been down for so long , &quot; one S &amp; P 500 futures floor source said . 
he attributed the late buying to short-covering and said activity was light . 
the upmove gained speed after T-bond futures closed . 
a heavy T-bond tone amid strong U.S. data had weighed on March S &amp; Ps earlier in the day , but March managed to shake off that pressure and drift higher . 
in the afternoon rally , March reached 796.30 , just shy of Friday &apos;s high of 797.80 . 
the February U.S. National Association of Purchasing Management index and January construction spending kept a temporary early lid on T-bonds and S &amp; Ps . 
January construction spending rose 0.4 percent and December spending was revised to down 0.9 PCT from down 0.7 percent . 
NAPM &apos;s February index was 53.1 , above the 52.9 forecast and the 52.0 reading in January . 
traders noted a dose of caution in the market ahead of remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday and key employment data on Friday . 
Greenspan will deliver the second leg of his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on Wednesday , this time to the House Banking Committee . 
some traders said they expected few fireworks from his remarks since his prepared text has already been heard . 
others said any mention of the high level of U.S. stocks in the question and answer portion of his testimony could pressure stocks again . 
Greenspan said last Wednesday that he could not rule out a pre-emptive credit tightening , and said caution was due in U.S. stocks as the market &apos;s rise might not be sustainable . 
his comments on the stock market were similar to last December &apos;s &quot; irrational exuberance &quot; statement , traders noted . 
on Monday &apos;s late rise , traders said mild buy-stops were triggered above 795.00 . 
&quot; But there was nothing that sent people scrambling , &quot; a trader said . 
he said early resilience was tied to the idea that Friday &apos;s sell-off after T-bonds closed was too reactionary and March S &amp; Ps needed to correct upward .
