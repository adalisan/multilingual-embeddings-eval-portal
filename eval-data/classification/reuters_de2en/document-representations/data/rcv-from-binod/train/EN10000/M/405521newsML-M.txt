Kuwait Petroleum Corp ( KPC ) is likely to set the new term naphtha price at $ 13.50 per tonne over the mean of Middle Eastern quotes as some buyers are believed to have unofficially accepted the price , traders said on Wednesday . 
once some players accept that , it &apos;s difficult for anybody else not to accept that as well , &quot; one naphtha dealer said . 
the new price compares with the current premium of $ 6.50 for the one-year term that started a year ago , and of $ 7.90 for August 1996-July 1997 . 
traders attribute the sharp rise in premiums to Asia &apos;s growing appetite for naphtha as petrochemical feedstock . 
most buyers in the term price talks , which started on February 17 in Singapore , are expected to accept the offer price by the end of this week or early next , they said . 
term lifters in the negotiations , mainly trading houses , refiners and petrochemical firms from Japan and South Korea , are expected to buy about two million tonnes of full-range naphtha from Kuwait during the term year .
