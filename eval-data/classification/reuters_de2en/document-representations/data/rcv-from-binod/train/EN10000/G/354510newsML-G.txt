two homemade bombs believed to have been set by opponents of a toxic waste dump exploded at the homes of local officials in the southern Spanish town of Nerva , its mayor Jose Villalba said on Monday . 
no one was hurt in the attacks , which damaged Villalba &apos;s house and that of Nerva councillor Juan Antonio Marquez . 
Villalba accused the Andalusian governor &apos;s office in Seville of not taking any action to end the &quot; wave of violence &quot; which he said had hit the town since a local group started opposition to the dump &apos;s construction a year ago . 
&quot; These are terrorist acts , &quot; Villalba told journalists . 
&quot; There must follow a firm line of action to investigate , clarify , and then put it in the hands of the courts , &quot; he said . 
&quot; That must be done immediately ; one cannot keep a people , as they are being kept , at the mercy of a violent minority . 
he attributed various acts of violence to the group including the burning of equipment , attacks on town councillors &apos; cars , grafitti and a fire at his father-in-law &apos;s house . 
a spokeswoman for the opposition group , which holds daily protests at the dump &apos;s construction site , told Spanish television that it was not involved in planting the bombs . 
&quot; That had nothing to do with us . 
we were tucked in bed at the time , &quot; she said .
