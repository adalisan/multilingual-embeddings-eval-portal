NWE gas oil cargoes were little changed on Wednesday but Rotterdam barges eased a shade on poor demand . 
premiums for cargoes above the IPE firmed 75 cents a tonne offsetting a similar drop in the underlying futures . 
dealers said firmer premiums reflected reduced Russian loadings from Ventspils and better demand for EN590 diesel grade . 
&quot; Russian is a little bit tight and EN590 was well bid around $ 6 ( above the IPE ) today , &quot; said a trader . 
cargoes of 0.2 percent sulphur DIN product , which excludes Russian , talked $ 1.75 a tonne above September IPE for delivery into Hamburg while Russian was $ 1.25 over . 
in Rotterdam barges asked 75 cents above the IPE for heating oil and $ 4 over for EN590 . 
in Antwerp the same products asked 25 cents and $ 4.25 over respectively . 
&quot; barges premiums have suffered a bit . 
absolute prices are just too high for end users at the moment , &quot; said a trader . 
some dealers expect prices to stay tight in the short term but ease for early September deliveries . 
buyers said French inland demand had picked up in recent days and saw only one cargo available for delivery by 25 August .
