strict laws and frequent use of the death penalty are failing to deter Asian drug traffickers because the potential profits from their illicit trade are so huge , United Nations experts said on Friday . 
&quot; The margin of profit is so large that these traffickers go to any kind of trouble and take so much risk , even the risk of losing their lives , &quot; said Abdul Latif , Asia-Pacific regional chief of the U.N. Drug Control Programme ( UNDCP ) . 
Latif spoke after the conclusion Friday of a five-day gathering of about 150 drug enforcement officials from 50 countries aimed at improving cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking in Asia . 
Iran , for example , routinely executes large numbers of traffickers but the trade continues to thrive , he said . 
Asian nations such as Malaysia , Singapore and the Philippines impose death sentences for possession of even small amounts of illegal drugs . 
the UNDCP estimates that the Asian heroin trade alone amounts to $ 63 billion every year . 
Asia accounts for more than half the world &apos;s total output of heroin , which is derived from the opium poppy . 
Asian countries , led by Laos , Burma , Afghanistan and Pakistan , produce about 4,700 tonnes of opium every year . 
it takes 10 tonnes of opium to produce one tonne of heroin . 
Asian addicts consume about 125 tonnes of the region &apos;s total annual heroin output and another 200 tonnes are exported to North America and Europe . 
the rest is confiscated by authorities . 
UNDCP secretary Paulsen Bailey said the drug menace spans the globe . 
&quot; This is a problem which cuts across all borders today ... regardless of the type of social structure that we are looking at , &quot; he said . 
the problem is also growing due to the fast-paced lifestyle spawned by Asia &apos;s economic growth and the immense power of drug syndicates , UNDCP law enforcement adviser Richard Dickins said . 
&quot; The organisations in this part of the world are large , powerful and have an awful lot of influence . 
they are structured as criminal organisations with tentacles that spread through different parts of the world , &quot; Dickins added . 
Conference participants called on governments to introduce more laws on such issues as money laundering to deprive drug traffickers of ways of financing their trade .
