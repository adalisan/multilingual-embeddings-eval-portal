Mexican stocks were seen opening mixed to higher on Thursday . 
some traders saw profit-taking after sharp gains notched up by market heavyweight Telmex on Wednesday , while others saw stocks bolstered by expected upside on Wall Street . 
&quot; Some profit-taking on Telmex would be healthy , and that could weigh the market down , but the overall outlook is good and Wall Street is buoyant again , &quot; one desk trader said . 
dealers expected the peso to open firm on lower U.S. long bond yields and capital inflow to the Mexican financial markets . 
nonetheless , traders said 48-hour contracts could weaken on pre-weekend swaps and added that peso strength in general could be curbed by banks choosing to exercise dollar puts options with the central bank . 
yields on U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds were up 6 / 32 to yield 7.08 percent 
dealers predicted a trading range of 7.8775 / 7.8950 per dollar for the benchmark 48-hour peso . 
Pre-open bids stood at 7.8850 / 7.8875 per dollar , compared to Wednesday &apos;s close of 7.8830 / 7.8880 . 
overnight rates on Cetes were seen opening down from Wednesday &apos;s high close of 25.50 percent on expected peso firmness . 
dealers noted the market was still susceptible to speculation by big players holding most liquidity that gives them the arm-twisting option to jack up rates .
