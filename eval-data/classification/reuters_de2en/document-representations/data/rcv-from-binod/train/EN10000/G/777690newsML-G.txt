the private secretary of an Indonesian writer went on trial on Tuesday , charged with spreading hatred against President Suharto by helping his employer with a highly critical book , the Antara news agency said . 
Buyung Rachmat Buchori Nasution , 34 , was arrested last March soon after the book &quot; New Era , New Leadership -- ( Soe ) Badio rejects the Engineering by the New Order Regime &quot; was published by Soebadio Sastrosatomo , a former chairman of the now defunct Indonesian Socialist Party ( PSI ) . 
Sastrosatomo , 78 , has been questioned by authorities about the 50-page book , which was published in January and sold widely before it was banned on March 4 by the Attorney-General , who said it could provoke unrest and create a negative view of the government . 
but he was never charged . 
Antara quoted prosecutor Uri Hasan Basri as saying in his opening statement to the South Jakarta State Court that Nasution had intentionally spread hatred against the president by helping type and publish as many as 10,000 copies of the book . 
it quoted the prosecutor as saying one of the offending sentences from the book was : &quot; The neo-colonial system which was built by Suharto has caused the people suffering and as a result , gaps have occurred everywhere and caused various riots . 
human rights lawyers have described the case as unusual because Nasution did not write the book . 
the authorities have not said why they have not charged Sastrosatomo , a former legislator in the parliamentary period before Suharto &apos;s 30-year , so-called New Order government . 
the PSI was one of the many political parties that flourished during Indonesia &apos;s brief period of parliamentary democracy in the 1950s . 
in the 1970s , most non-government parties were forced to merge into three authorised parties , the ruling Golkar , the Moslem-oriented United Development Party ( PPP ) and the now fractured Christian-Nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party ( PDI ) .
