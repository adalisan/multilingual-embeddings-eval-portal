LIFFE September BTPs are expected to see a near term pull back to gather strength before pushing towards the historic high at 132.38 and beyond , technical analysts said . 
the market has risen almost three points in the last three days and a slight pull back would help it to gather momentum , they said . 
&quot; After three days of rallying the contract could weaken a bit , &quot; said a technical analyst at an Italian bank in London . 
&quot; Important resistance was broken at 131.90 , 132.00 but it looks like the market is retracing a bit for some profit taking . 
in early trade the contract pushed up to a new contract high at 132.09 . 
&quot; The main target is 132.38 , which is the historic high , &quot; the Italian bank analyst said . 
&quot; A failure there could take us down to around 131.00 , 130.90 but while we are above this area the market is positive . 
on continuation charts the all time high at 132.38 was set on January 23 . 
&quot; A bit of a retracement would be helpful for the contract in order to gain some momentum , &quot; he said . 
the analyst said a postive triangle formation was developing on daily charts , setting a medium term upside objective of around 133.10 . 
Daniele Castelnuovo , analyst at Banca Euromobiliare in Milan , also expected to see some retracement in the near term . 
he said the three-day rise , known as three advancing soldiers in Japanese candlestick terms , would signal resistance during this session . 
&quot; They will temporarily stop their march towards the target of around 133.00 to 134.00 , &quot; he said . 
September Eurolira futures were at 93.41 , down 0.01 .
