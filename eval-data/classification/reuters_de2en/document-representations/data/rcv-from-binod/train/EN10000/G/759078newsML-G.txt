labour Prime Minister Tony Blair has chosen a former Conservative sports minister to head a British soccer taskforce to revolutionise the sport , a government source said on Monday . 
David Mellor , who resigned in 1992 after a much-publicised affair with an actress and allegations over accepting a free holiday , will head the team to look at ways of getting a better deal for soccer fans . 
&quot; No one will be surprised when Mellor &apos;s name is announced , &quot; the source said . 
the 48-year-old sports-mad Chelsea supporter hosts a popular soccer phone-in programme on BBC radio and even allegedly wore his Chelsea shirt during intimate moments with Antonia de Sancha , his former mistress . 
the pudgy bespectacled politician , who was responsible until his resignation for sports and culture , lost his seat in Labour &apos;s May 1 general election victory . 
a spokesman for the Department of Culture , Media and Sport said the Mellor appointment &quot; was speculation &quot; at the moment but the government was hoping to make an announcement in the next few days . 
&quot; Whoever ( it is ) needs to be seen as credible . 
it has to be someone who has a knowledge of the game and has been in a position to appeal to the people who organise the game and supporters , &quot; he added . 
the taskforce will be charged with implementing what is being touted as one of the biggest shakeups in the history of the game . 
&quot; Mellor &apos;s controversial appointment will cause amazement . 
but he is a passionate fan -- seen as the man to push through sweeping reforms , &quot; The Mirror paper said . 
the taskforce will try to eliminate racism in the sport and encourage minorities to participate and support the game . 
it will also look at improving access for disabled supporters , altering ticketing and pricing policies to make matches more affordable and encouraging players to act as role models and get involved in community activities . 
&quot; I want to get a greater say for the ( soccer ) supporters and get more openness between those running the clubs and the fans , &quot; said Sports Minister Tony Banks .
