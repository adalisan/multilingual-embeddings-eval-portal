the Australian dollar remained soft in thin morning trade , finding only little relief in the fact the Reserve Bank stayed silent at its 9.30 am operation , the usual window of opportunity for a change in interest rates . 
there had been speculation the bank might ease policy today following the regular monthly meeting of its board on Tuesday , although most analysts had considered a cut unlikely . 
they cautioned a move was still possible this month if data on employment for April out on Thursday were much weaker than expected . 
the currency had slipped away Tuesday as investors were discouraged by its repeatedly failure to clear US $ 0.7860 resistance and decided to take a defensive stance just in case the RBA did surprise on rates . 
Seperate rallies in the yen , mark and sterling also undermined the dollar on the crosses and saw it lose 0.4 point on its trade weighted index to 60.3 . 
traders said the lack of a meaningful bounce on the RBA inactivity boded ill for the currency and they looked for a test of US $ 0.7755 support near term .
