Western Europe &apos;s economy should brighten considerably in the first half of next year , while U.S. grows more slowly , Germany &apos;s IFO institute found in a poll of international economists it published on Tuesday . 
Favorable currency rates and strong demand from Latin American and Asian markets should spur western European countries to grow 3.2 percent on average in 1997 , IFO said . 
in the U.S. , the 450 economists polled worldwide by IFO saw 2.25 percent growth in gross domestic product in 1997 , with inflation and unemployment remaining low . 
&quot; While dynamic development in the U.S. could ease somewhat , the upswing in Western Europe should take hold more quickly , &quot; IFO said . 
in Europe , Ireland and Norway could lead the rebound with high growth rates , followed by Britain and Denmark . 
Germany would see slight improvement , with difficult conditions enduring in France and Switzerland , IFO said . 
economists were less optimistic on Central and Eastern Europe , where emerging economies have grown rapidly in recent years . 
&quot; Above all , the Czech Republic is not figured to grow at a high rate in the next six months , &quot; IFO reported . 
U.S. growth should moderate from its pace in 1996 , although the economists saw little reason for concern . 
&quot; A recession is not around the corner , and the Federal Reserve will not allow the economy to overheat , &quot; the institute wrote , predicting &quot; low unemployment and low inflation , the best of both worlds -- at least for now .
