the New Zealand dollar ended an uneventful day on Friday with its head just above 69 cents . 
dealers predict it will remain in a US $ 0.6880-0.6930 band over the weekend and early next week as the market prepares for the Reserve Bank &apos;s crucial June 27 Monetary Policy Statement . 
the Trade-Weighted Index finished at 67.83 , little changed from its opening . 
dealers said the market was characterised by offshore buying and local selling . 
foreign interest is still a hangover from recent eurokiwis while locals sold into the TWI following its overnight rise . 
&quot; The local market still thinks there is a good chance of an easing in the MPS and are happy to go short at 0.6890 , &quot; said an Auckland dealer . 
the Food Price Index fell 0.8 percent in May and that lack of inflationary pressure is seen giving further room for the Reserve Bank to ease .
