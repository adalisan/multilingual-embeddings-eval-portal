zinc and aluminium went from strength to strength for most of Wednesday &apos;s London Metal Exchange ( LME ) midday trading session , before paring gains during the kerb . 
but copper sank decidedly lower after momentarily regaining the $ 2,300 level , as nearby tightness proceeded to unwind and LME stocks showed another healthy rise . 
the star of the complex is clearly zinc , which ploughed ahead to fresh seven year highs of $ 1,557 during the early part of the kerb , boosted in part by good consumer buying for 1998 , traders said . 
&quot; There &apos;s also been both shortcovering and borrowing out of the Far East , &quot; a trader added . 
but the market is very overbought , traders said , prompting prices to come off the highs by the end of the session to a $ 2 firmer $ 1,546 . 
zinc &apos;s cash / threes went from level to a peak of $ 12 / $ 14 backwardation , reflecting tightness concentrated initially in September , before easing back to $ 8 / $ 10 . 
copper displayed none of zinc &apos;s spark , ending $ 13 lower at $ 2,287 after failing to hold above $ 2,300 during a brief upside blip during the kerb . 
the cash / threes backwardation contracted steadily to $ 65 / $ 75 by the end of the kerb from $ 80 / $ 85 early in the morning and around $ 100 late on Tuesday . 
&quot; Tomorrow / next day &quot; traded up to $ 15 but finished the first ring at $ 8 , compared to $ 24 earlier this week . 
&quot; The market is still extremely nervous about the direction of the backwardation , and volumes were tiny out there . 
it went up on nothing and came back down on nothing , &quot; a trader said . 
as the nearby tightness , which sent cash / threes backwardation to $ 270 last week , eased , and metal sucked in by the previously high back flooded into LME warehouses , the market &apos;s temptation to stage a sell-off was growing , traders said . 
LME stocks rose by 72,625 tonnes in July , surpassing the psychological 200,000 tonne mark on Wednesday . 
but aluminium , trading at two-month highs , managed to hold onto a good chunk of early gains notched up after hurdling $ 1,620 resistance . 
it was $ 13 firmer at $ 1,628 . 
technically aluminium was looking better if it could hold these levels , as a previous &quot; double top &quot; resistance just under current levels should now provide support . 
the other metals were unchanged to slightly firmer in slow seasonal trading . 
lead was stable at $ 645 after trading in a tiny range , while tin was just $ 10 firmer at $ 5,380 . 
nickel edged up $ 25 to $ 6,790 but its price range was also tiny . 
Alloy , taking heart from primary , was indicated firmer at $ 1,457 / 1,460 versus $ 1,448 / 53 .
