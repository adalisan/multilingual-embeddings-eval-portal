Hong Kong &apos;s most senior official on Friday urged demonstrators challenging Japan &apos;s control of a small group of islands in the East China Sea not to jeopardise the territory &apos;s relations with Tokyo . 
ending a week-long visit to Australia , Chief Secretary Anson Chan said she was saddened by the death of Hong Kong activist David Chan during a protest action in waters around the islands , but she urged calm in the aftermath of the tragedy . 
&quot; I understand the depth of feeling but I hope that views will be expressed in a calm manner without affecting the relationship between ourselves and Japan , &quot; she said . 
her remarks from Melbourne were broadcast on Hong Kong radio . 
thousands of Hong Kong people are expected to join a candlelight vigil in a central city park on Sunday night to commemorate Chan &apos;s death . 
the Chief Secretary , second-in-command to Hong Kong &apos;s colonial Governor Chris Patten , said the dispute over the islands , referred to in Chinese as the Diaoyus and in Japanese as the Senkakus , needed to be settled peacefully . 
activist David Chan , leader of 18 protesters who were aboard the ship Kien Hwa 2 , drowned on Thursday after leaping into stormy seas in defiance of a blockade of the disputed islands by Japanese coastguard vessels . 
his death was the first in almost two months of protests by Chinese communities in Hong Kong , China , Taiwan and Macau since Japanese rightwingers built a lighthouse and raised Japanese flags on the islands .
