the European Union and Mexico signed on Thursday a mutual recognition accord for their leading spirit drinks , which is expected to boost bilateral trade in whisky , cognac , tequila and other spirits . 
the deal means Mexico cannot market home grown versions of Scotch whisky and French champagne under the names of their European rivals . 
similarly , European drinks manufacturers are forbidden from producing the traditional Mexican spirits tequila and mezcal , which currently account for 83 percent of Mexico &apos;s spirits exports . 
European spirits also account for 83 percent of the $ 270 million Mexican market , three quarters of that accounted for by whisky , brandy and cognac . 
these sales amount to only two percent of the EU &apos;s $ 1.32 billion spirits export market but after sales to Mexico plummeted by nearly 50 percent in 1995 and only made a 16 percent recovery in 1996 , EU manufacturers are anxious to ensure their products are not pushed out by imitations . 
Mexico is also keen to increase its spirits sales to the EU , which imports only a sixth of what it exports to Mexico . 
Mexican spirits make up only 12 percent of the EU market , where consumers have traditionally preferred their own spirits to more exotic beverages like tequila . 
but with its exports growing by an annual 13 percent over recent years , to reach over $ 198 million in 1996 , Mexico is confident there is great potential for boosting sales in Europe beyond the current $ 23 million level .
