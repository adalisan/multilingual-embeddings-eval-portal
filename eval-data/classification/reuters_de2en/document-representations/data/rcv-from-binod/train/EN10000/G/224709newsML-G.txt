recalled batsman Greg Blewett brought up his half century during the final session of play to steer Australia out of trouble on the first day of the second test against West Indies on Friday . 
Blewett , brought back into the side to replace the injured Steve Waugh , was 52 not out as Australia recovered from a poor start to be 208 for five . 
Blewett and first test hero Ian Healy had built a partnership of 77 after Australia lost Michael Bevan in the first over after tea . 
Healy was on 36 . 
Australia had earlier been 94 for four . 
West Indies captain Courtney Walsh took the new ball immediately after the first 80 overs .
