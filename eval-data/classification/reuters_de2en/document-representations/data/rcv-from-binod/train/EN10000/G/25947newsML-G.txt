former South Korean president chun Doo Hwan on Saturday appealed against his death sentence handed down on Monday , ending days of speculation about whether he was prepared to go meekly to the gallows . 
chun was convicted of leading a 1979 coup and then ordering troops to crush resistance by pro-democracy activists in the southern city of Kwangju in a 1980 massacre . 
his successor , Roh Tae-woo , also appealed against his 22-1 / 2 year jail term for playing a secondary role in the coup and Kwangju killings . 
both men were further convicted of amassing vast fortunes by soliciting bribes from business tycoons . 
&quot; I decided to appeal because it is the duty of former presidents to reveal the truth , &quot; chun was quoted by his lawyer , chun Sang-suk , as saying , according to a report by the domestic Yonhap news agency . 
chun and Roh had seven days to challenge the court &apos;s verdicts , but media reports at one point quoted chun &apos;s lawyers as saying he may not bother . 
the appeals could drag on for up to eight months if the two former generals fight all the way to the Supreme Court . 
but many Koreans believe that regardless of the result , current President Kim Young-sam is likely to pardon chun and Roh before he steps down at the end of next year . 
the one-time military academy classmates have defended their grab for power as being necessary to restore order and avert possible North Korean military action following the assassination of president Park Chung-hee . 
more than a score of former presidential aides and former generals were sentenced with chun and Roh along with nine leading businessmen convicted of offering bribes .
