Pol Pot still poses a threat to Cambodia &apos;s political stability , even if news that the notorious Khmer Rouge strongman has surrendered turns out to be true . 
political analysts say his capitulation to his former comrades on Wednesday , if confirmed , was likely to add to the already strained ties between Cambodia &apos;s rival premiers . 
Khmer Rouge radio , apparently under the control of a guerrilla faction that broke with Pol Pot earlier this month , reported on Wednesday that he had turned himself in to them . 
the radio gave no details as to his whereabouts and some senior government officials were cautious about the report &apos;s validity . 
Cambodian co-Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen have for months been locked in a bitter feud over power sharing in their coalition with both men striving to bolster their strength in the run-up to elections next year . 
the Khmer Rouge , responsible for the death of more than one milion people during their 1975-79 &quot; killing fields &quot; rule , has been decimated by by government offensives , defections and splits since boycotting a 1993 election . 
as the rebels lost military might , they have gained political muscle as the two feuding premiers have vied to win the guerrillas over to their respective ranks . 
Ranariddh wants to pardon those rebel leaders seen as less tarnished and forge a political alliance with them to strengthen his position . 
Hun Sen is keen to head off any deal that helps his rival , the analysts said . 
with Pol Pot apparently on the ropes , the way would be clear for Ranariddh to strike a deal with the more acceptable Khmer Rouge leadership which could spark a showdown with Hun Sen , they said . 
&quot; This news won &apos;t help the situation down here , &quot; said a foreign political analyst in Phnom Penh . 
&quot; That &apos;s what &apos;s worrisome . 
&quot; This may be the end of the Khmer Rouge &apos;s military but the beginning of its politics , &quot; said another political analyst . 
Hun Sen said on Wednesday that Ranariddh had to decide whether he would work with his coalition partner or side with the Khmer Rouge . 
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why my partner in the coalition government went to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge , &quot; he told reporters . 
&quot; This is the betrayal which cannot be accepted , &quot; he said . 
Ranariddh said last week the Khmer Rouge had split and most of Pol Pot &apos;s supporters had turned against him . 
Pol Pot was on the run in jungle in the north of the country with a small core of loyalists , he said . 
that report sparked a further deterioration in ties between Ranariddh and Hun Sen and on Tuesday night security men from the their rival political parties clashed on the streets of the capital , leaving two of Ranariddh &apos;s men dead . 
the analysts also said that with relations between the two premiers near breaking point , the Khmer Rouge could exploit the situation to their advantage . 
&quot; The Khmer Rouge could be the ones who profit , &quot; said an Asian diplomat . 
the rebels were skillful at exploiting differences in the coalition to win concessions , he added .
