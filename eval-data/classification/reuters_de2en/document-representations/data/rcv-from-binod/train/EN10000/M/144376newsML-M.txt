options on Italian government bonds , one of the fastest rising markets this year , were a shade softer as implied volatility levels eased in typical pre-weekend trade on Friday , dealers said . 
but the explosive nature of the Italian market would deter players from going short of gamma , especially after some in the market were hit hard by sharp volatility rises earlier in the year when they had sold out-of-the-money calls . 
put spreads on December BTP contracts have been popular recently as buyers expect BTP futures to cool off after their stellar gains earlier . 
but call spreads on March were well bid . 
&quot; Over the last few days most of the trades were put spreads on December and call spreads on March pretty far out of the money , &quot; said a dealer at an Italian bank in Milan . 
the expectation , he said , was that the underlying market could take a bit of knock on nervousness about the Italian budget process , at least until it is approved . 
&quot; They see a possible drop of one to two points , &quot; he said , adding that the buyers would probably rather buy the puts and hold onto their underlying investments rather than book their profits on BTP futures and get out altogether . 
volatility on December options on December futures was trading around 8.28 percent , but traders said it was likely to ease off to around 8.20 percent by the end of the day as dealers offload volatility to avoid weekend time decay . 
on March contracts , volatility was around 7.72 / 75 percent but traders said it would probably come off to around 7.70 by the close on Friday . 
&quot; On Monday we should see Vol picking up a bit , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; People would prefer to stay long rather than short in terms of gamma . 
being short in this market can be dangerous . 
gamma measures the rate of change between delta and the underlying market . 
Delta itself gauges the rate of change in options prices and the underlying market . 
being long or short of gamma is essentially being long or short of volatility . 
the Milan dealer said in the past many in the market suffered a double blow when , having sold out-of-the-money calls while volatility was down around five percent , the market shot higher and volatility also jumped up over eight percent . 
&quot; They probably thought that usually when the market goes up volatility comes off , &quot; he said . 
a cash bond options trader at another Italian bank in Milan said the Bank of Italy &apos;s interest rate cut earlier this week left the door open for another cut later in the year , but he said the options market would be quiet in the meantime . 
he added , &quot; A lot of people are looking to sell puts because they have been squeezed and they have no paper . 
if we see the market collapse again , we will see a lot of damage ( to those who took that position ) . 
two month price volatility on 10-year Italian bonds was around 8.9 percent , he said , down from around 10 percent in recent weeks .
