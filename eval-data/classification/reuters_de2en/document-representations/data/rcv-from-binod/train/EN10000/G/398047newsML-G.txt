the stunning news that scientists had cloned a sheep plunged medical ethicists head-long into a disturbing debate on Monday about duplicating human beings that many experts thought they could postpone indefinitely . 
&quot; ethicists have been asking &apos; what if &apos; for years . 
but the scientists always said , &apos; Don &apos;t worry about it , &apos; &quot; Dianne Barthels , associate director of the University of Minnesota Centre for biomedical Ethics , said on Monday . 
&quot; We thought this wasn &apos;t possible and that we didn &apos;t have to worry about it for a while , &quot; she said . 
&quot; Then it happened . 
President Bill Clinton on Monday called on his national bioethics advisory panel to review the legal and ethical implications and report back in 90 days . 
in the United States it is illegal to use federal research money for most human embryo research , but there are scant restrictions on privately-funded science . 
the biotechnology industry has called for a clear legal ban on human cloning . 
this past weekend , Ian Wilmut of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh reported that he had used the cell of an adult sheep to create a baby clone . 
the technology is still clumsy and too imperfect for widespread use , and Wilmut has stressed he intends it to be used on animals , not people . 
the possibilities are vast , ranging from saving endangered species , to cloning cows that can yield huge amounts of milk , to developing a crop of identical mice that can speed up the search for cancer treatments . 
&quot; Notice that these things all involve animals -- and they involve recognised social goods , &quot; said Glenn McGee , an ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of a new book called &quot; perfect Baby . 
McGee said it is too soon to know if the sheep technique could actually produce human babies . 
&quot; But for the sake of argument , if you could do this with people , we shouldn &apos;t , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I think , frankly , we need a national commission on genetics and the family , which will study the whole range of these new opportunities parents have to engineer their children . 
we &apos;re in the process of moving from an era of parents having babies to an era where they make babies , &quot; he said . 
some scientists believe the technique could work on humans -- and that it is just a matter of time before someone tries it , whether in an attempt to recreate a dead loved one , or in an act of ego and hubris to reproduce or perpetuate themselves . 
but even in that case , someone who may be physically identical to another person would still be born in a different time , and face different environmental , cultural and historical experiences . 
&quot; To people who have been following this field , the sheep cloning was not a total surprise , &quot; said Ed Berger , a biologist and ethicist at Dartmouth College . 
&quot; scientifically , technologically , we sort of knew it was going to happen eventually . 
the scientific roots go back to experiments with frogs and toads in the 1970s , but the accompanying moral and ethical questions got postponed partly , in Berger &apos;s view , because they were just too hard and too scary . 
&quot; They never took place , we never said , what are the serious ethical arguments against it . 
and we have to have that debate now , &quot; he said . 
&quot; If it &apos;s unnatural , weird and maybe offensive to do this with sheep , it &apos;s orders of magnitude weirder to do it with humans , &quot; Berger said . 
nevertheless , he expects it to happen . 
&quot; You &apos;d have to be a fool not to be astonished by this , you are filled with awe of the achievement of these scientists , &quot; said Eric Parens , at the prestigious Hastings Centre on medical ethics . 
&quot; But we do need to learn to step back . 
one ought to start worrying about what it is that we value about each other . 
it seems to me that we make a mistake if what we value most are the sorts of traits that are encoded in our genome . 
this way of thinking contributes to misconceptions about what it means to be a human being , &quot; he said .
