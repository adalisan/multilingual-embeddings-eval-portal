Greek shares settled with mild 0.33 percent gains after narrow trade on low volume with the benchmark index settling at 909.03 . 
market watchers expected a subdued market this week . 
&quot; Part of the reason for the volume drop is that short selling is not taking place as easily as before . 
stocks will be subdued and trade between 890-920 points this week until blue chips attract buying interest and lead the market higher , &quot; said fund manager Michalis Elefteriou . 
&quot; The market &apos;s fundamentals are attractive and valuations are low . 
but there isn &apos;t enough volume by medium-term buyers to countervail short-term profit takers . 
blue chips will be the preferred plays in the short term , &quot; he said .
