the Cahners Business Confidence Index ( CBCI ) rose 1.1 points to 67.5 in May from 66.4 in April , Cahners Economics said . 
despite the up-and-down shifts in the index over the past five months , the CBCI has remained solidly above its 12-month moving average in every month of this year , a Cahners report said . 
&quot; This suggests that the business community sees a better economic environment for 1997 than they did for 1996 , &quot; the report said . 
the employment component showed the healthiest gains , rising 3.2 points to 70.6 . 
both the production and plans to increase marketing spending components rose over two points , to 77.8 and 67.1 , respectively . 
the research and development measure posted the greatest loss , down 2.1 points to 63.9 , while the product introduction component fell 1.3 points to 70.8 . 
Cahners said the rebound in business confidence is largely attributable to the equipment and electronics manufacturing industries , Cahners said . 
with strong gains in May , &quot; these two industries now top the list with indices of 69.1 and 68.3 , respectively , &quot; Cahners said .
