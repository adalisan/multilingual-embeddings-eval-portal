but the market appears to have discounted a greater degree of monetary policy easing by the central bank than is warranted . 
indeed , the extent of the slowdown has been softer than elsewhere in the region , primarily because of Indonesia &apos;s low exposure to the high value added end of the electronics sector . 
the trade cycle has held up much better than in many other countries in the region , on account of decent volume growth and a favourable terms of trade effect from higher oil prices . 
however , the recent trade data suggests that the underlying increase in the trade surplus is beginning to peak . 
the deceleration in money growth has been slow , with M2 still hovering at around 26 percent and credit growth at around 19.8 percent in 1996 , in excess of the government &apos;s original target for 16 percent and 17 percent growth respectively . 
the government has announced growth targets of 17 percent and 18 percent respectively for M2 and credit for 1997 , which suggests that the bias in monetary policy remain tight . 
however , heavy capital inflows in recent weeks have pushed down interbank rates at the short end . 
indeed , the hefty gains in the stock market since November now seems to have been driven primarily by excess liquidity . 
the stock of SBIs outstanding , which gives an indication of the central bank &apos;s intervention activities , is now at levels not seen since the capital inflows surge of 1993-94 . 
we cannot imagine the central bank being too happy with this state of affairs ; after all , the idea behind the IDR intervention band widening policy is to get Bi away from sterilising on the scale of 1993-94 . 
the FY97 draft budget was positively received by the market . 
the government painted a relatively sanguine picture of the public and external accounts going forward . 
the current account deficit is projected to stabilise at around four percent of GDP and the external debt ratio to decline modestly from 31.7 percent in F96 to 31.2 percent in F97 . 
the assumption of an average $ 16.50 per barrel oil price is conservative , and means that the government is likely to overshoot its revenue projections . 
the government is also likely to reaffirm its fiscal rectitude by using the expected surplus to accelerate its foreign debt repayments . 
by keeping a lid on its revenue projections , the Ministry of Finance relieves the pressure from spending demands from other parts of the public sector . 
Bank Indonesia will probably tolerate a modest degree of relaxation in monetry policy conditions , but it still prefers to keep a tight policy stance overall . 
growth in monetary and credit aggregates -- while falling -- are still too high , which suggests the need for continued monetary restraint . 
sterilisation has been stepped up but not to a sufficient degree to prevent an increase in excess liquidity in the system . 
with talk of interest rate cuts of up to 200 bps being bandied about , we think the market has become over-optimistic about the degree of monetary relaxation that Bank Indonesia can afford in the near-medium term . 
headline inflation rates have continued to fall , as have credit growth and growth in the broader monetary aggregates . 
yet the headline numbers overstate the degree of improvement in the underlying inflation situation , and Bi &apos;s monetary and credit growth targets continue to be overshot . 
interest rate declines in the interbank market are being driven by burgeoning capital inflows rather than a central bank moving into outright easing mode . 
in fact , the huge increase in Bank Indonesia &apos;s sterilisation operation recently suggest that the monetary authorities are trying to slow down the pace of interest rate decline . 
with spot IDR currently trading a bit further off of the dollar-rupiah intervention band in recent times , and the central bank apparently under some pressure to sterilise money market liquidity , IDR band-widening is likely to re-emerge as a theme in the foreign exchange market . 
the JCI &apos;s strong performance in the past three months ( + 14 percent ) was on the back of falling interest rates . 
per on 12-month forward earnings now trades at 16.4x compared to its five-year average of 17.5x. 
while we are confident that rates will remian benign in the short term , the stocks are approaching our target prices . 
we remain overweight . 
the main economic indicators do not suggest any major imbalances in the economy at present . 
at a macro level , the strength of external demand remains a key risk . 
the recent trade data suggest that the best of the underlying improvement in the trade account may be over , but even so , this is not to suggest that the trade picture has suddenly turned bad . 
the current account deficit is expected to widen again this year but will remain well below four percent of GDP -- a mild deterioration over recent years &apos; performances but still respectable when compared with other countries in the region . 
more importantly , for an economy growing at 7-8 percent a year in real terms , a sub-four percent current account deficit-GDP ratio is perceived by market participants to be sustainable . 
a potential risk for equity participants is whether the central bank in increasingly concerned with excess liquidity in the system . 
we had previuosly noted that the rise in the equity market in recent months appears to be liquidity-driven , and this can quickly come to an end if Bank Indonesia is compelled to shut off the liquidity tap . 
another relaxation of the intervention band is still on the cards , but we understand from recent visits to the central bank that decisions to widen the band can often originate and be approved within the same day . 
if our information is correct , then this means that the authorities do not have a pre-set or pre-meditated agenda in terms of band-widening policy . 
the implication is that it would be extremely difficult for market participants to correctly time band widening moves . 
our analysis suggests that risk-averse market participants should continue to emphasise yield as the key attraction in IDR rather than punt on spot rupiah appreciation ( via the timing of a band widening ) . 
market participants have become bullish about the prospect for significantly lower interest rates on the back of falling headline inflation numbers , and a modest decline in monetary aggregate growth in recent months . 
however , suggestions that money market interest rates declines seen in recent months will be further extended by another 100-200 BP , or will be reflected in Bi intervention rates and bank lending rates will certainly not be validated by the bank in the foreseeable future . 
we discuss why below . 
it is true that the profile of headline inflation has improved markedly . 
indeed , the government reported a 1.03 percent monthly increase in inflation for January , which translates into a YoY rise of 2.16 percent . 
considering the increase in seasonal demand in the early part of the year associated with the Islamic new year celebrations , this was a subdued inflation outcome . 
for comparison , January 1996 saw a monthly rise in inflation of over two percent . 
however , if food items are stripped out of the index , the underlying rate of inflation is very much higher than suggested by the headline rate . 
on our annual basis , underlying inflation is probably closer to eight percent compared with the headline rate of around six percent published by the Indonesian authorities . 
food and related items make up around 50 percent of the official CPI basket , and there also exists a set of administered and non-administered prices . 
interestingly , movements of inflation in administered prices and non-administered prices appear to offset each other . 
in the latter part of 1995 non-administered price inflation ( on a year-on-year basis ) rose sharply , while at the same time inflation in administered prices moderated just as sharply . 
the net result was only modest upward pressure on the overall rate of inflation during the period . 
consequently , what we have seen in recent months is a modest downward trend in the year-on-year headline inflation rate . 
the asymmetric movements in administered and non-administered prices in recent quarters suggest that the improvement in headline inflation performance has been driven -- to a non-trivial extent -- by non-market forces . 
the central bank will therefore be cautious about validating market expectations for a significant easing in the full structure of interest rates anytime soon . 
Bank Indonesia has tolerated a modest easing of interbank interest rates in recent weeks , but it would be a mistake to conclude from this that the central bank is about to shift into outright easing mode . 
the behaviour of monetary and growth aggregates in recent quarters also lend support to our view that while Bank Indonesia may tolerate a modest degree of relaxation in monetary policy conditions , the stance of policy will remain tight . 
base money growth has stabilised through 1996 , but still has topped out at historically high levels . 
we also note that Bank Indonesia informed commercial banks that they were &quot; expected &quot; to expand their loan portfolios in line with the central bank &apos;s monetary and credit growth targets . 
the communication carried a much stronger note of instruction than the previous &quot; guidance lines &quot; used by Bank Indonesia . 
however , nine months later , the official data show that Bank Indonesia &apos;s M2 and credit growth targets for 1996 have been overshot . 
although it has been coming down in recent months , M2 grew 26 percent in 1996 compared with the official target for 16 percent growth . 
the official target of 17 percent growth in M2 this year suggests that the bias of monetary policy will remain tight . 
credit growth grew 19.8 percent last year , apparently overshooting the official 17 percent target by only a modest margin . 
however , the reality is that if bank lending extended by certain state banks are excluded , then the data will show significantly higher credit growth rates . 
this suggests that credit demand in the private sector remains robust -- another argument against a premature or excessive easing in Bank Indonesia &apos;s policy settings . 
although we believe the market may have become too optimistic on the prospect for significantly lower interest rates in Indonesia soon , the headline economic data do not point to any major imbalances in the exonomy at the present . 
overheating risks remain , but much of the overheating pressures have moderated . 
our chief worry in the near-medium term is whether the market has adequately priced in event risk . 
market participants have taken a relatively sanguine view of potential political risk after the government effectively suppressed the July 1996 riots in Jakarta and subsequently marginalised Megawati from the political scene . 
however , the fact that this issue is not being more widely discussed by market participants may be unsettling . 
therefore Bank Indonesia will want to build up foreign reserves in coming months as a precautionary measure . 
interestingly , the stock of SBIs outstanding appears to have risen again rather sharply -- to perhaps as high as Rp22 trillion for the latest reporting period in February . 
this is a quantum jump from just under Rp13 trillion in October , just four months ago . 
we think so . 
this is consistent with our suggestion that : 
1 ) the overall monetary policy stance needs to remain tight , and 
2 ) the authorities are pricing in event risk to a greater extent than market participants are currently doing . 
the most recently available reserves data at the time of writing is for the month of October , with the average level of reserves in the five months to October standing at just under $ 21 billion . 
clearly , if forthcoming reserves data do show a meaningful increase , then it corroborates our suggestion that Bank Indonesia has been building up a buffer against heightened event risk . 
however , this is not without cost to the central Bank . 
the rate Bank Indonesia is paying out on 30-day SBI paper is comparable to what it had to pay out during the 1993-94 episode of surging capital inflows into the economy . 
( indeed , rupiah-USD rate differentials now are quite similar to 1993-94 levels ) . 
one key reason behind the IDR intevention band widening policy in recent quarters was to get the pressure off the central bank to sterilise ; we cannot imagine bank Indonesia being too happy about recent developments , therefore .
