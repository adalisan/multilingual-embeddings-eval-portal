rescue workers looking for a U.S. warplane that mysteriously disappeared from a training mission 18 days ago spotted on Sunday what appeared to be several pieces of metal that could be part of a plane &apos;s wreckage , an Air Force spokesman said . 
two helicoptors were dispatched to a sheer side of New York mountain near Vail , Colorado for further checks , Lt. Keith Shephard said . 
however , because of poor weather it was not known when ground troops could be sent in even if rescue workes believe the metal to be part of the wreckage of the A-10 thunderbolt that disappeared April 2 , the spokesman said . 
the plane disappeared during a routine training mission . 
air Force officials have been at a loss to explain why Capt. 
Craig button , 32 , left the mission and apparently veered northeast into Colorado , some 850 miles ( 1,350 km ) from where the training exercise had been taking place . 
defence officials said the plane , carrying four 500-pound ( 225-kg ) conventional Mark 82 bombs , disappeared from the rear of a three-plane formation after leaving Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near Tuscon , Arizona .
