it &apos;s not easy to upstage Frankie Dettori but watch this space . 
it may be hard to believe but , within a week or so of Dettori riding all seven winners at Ascot , the spotlight has moved on to another young lion . 
enter , on the Longchamp stage , Olivier Peslier , like Dettori young and ambitious -- and riding out of his skin . 
Peslier , French champion jockey apparent , and his partner Helissio turned in the performance of their lives thus far to win Sunday &apos;s Prix de l &apos;Arc de Triomphe . 
it was an astonishing piece of theatre which immediately invited comparisons with the great triumphs of Ribot in 1956 and Sea Bird nine years later . 
that august pair won by six lengths but Helissio could have stretched seven or eight lengths clear had Peslier chosen not to rise out of the saddle to accept the plaudits . 
&quot; I had also lost my cap and I thought maybe they were letting me win or there had been a false start . 
but there was no mistake as Helissio left a highly talented field , including four classic winners , struggling in his slipstream . 
the next act for Helissio has still to be determined -- Japan may beckon -- but for Peslier it is clear : the French jockeys &apos; title and an ever-increasing worldwide presence . 
even before Sunday he possessed , at 23 , an impressive international portfolio with victories in the Irish Derby , Royal Ascot &apos;s coronation stakes , Italy &apos;s Gran criterium and a group two race in Japan . 
it adds up to a hectic lifestyle which on one recent weekend took him in four days from France to England , back to France then on to Ireland before returning to Longchamp to ride Helissio in his Arc preparatory race . 
victory in Sunday &apos;s event was all the sweeter for Peslier since it helped erase the disappointment of 12 months earlier when , partnering Freedom cry , he finished a close up second to Dettori on Lammtarra . 
this year , while Helissio sprinted away , Dettori , on classic Cliche , trailed in last , his partner racing over a distance short of his best . 
but Dettori will be back . 
both men have an exuberance about them which has caught the imagination . 
while Peslier has still to copy Dettori &apos;s flying dismount , he is an engaging character who , for releasing energy , indulges in paintballing , a mock fight in which participants in combat gear use paint as ammunition . 
Dettori &apos;s feat at Ascot lifted him from star to superstar status . 
no jockey has ever won seven races in succession at one meeting and to do it at such a highly competitive meeting bordered on the miraculous . 
it was in fact a 25,000-1 miracle which still has bookmakers licking their wounds . 
but the young Italian is not one to let the turf grow under his feet . 
he landed a group one victory at Newmarket last week and then on Saturday &apos;s Longchamp card won both the group two races for trainer John Gosden and owner Sheikh Mohammed . 
it would have been a treble but for Moonax , a difficult customer , throwing away his chance in the group one Prix du Cadran with a violent swerve in the last 300 metres . 
Moonax is likely to be back at Longchamp for the French St Leger , the last classic of the season . 
Dettori will be looking for compensation but watch out for that man Peslier .
