Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral of India was quoted on Tuesday as saying that new surface to surface missiles would be deployed along the nation &apos;s border only when the need arises but there was no danger at present . 
press Trust of India ( PTI ) quoted Gujral as saying the Prithvi missiles would be deployed &quot; as and when there is a threat . 
at present there is no danger along the border . 
earlier this month Gujral denied newspaper reports from the United States that India had deployed some Prithvi missiles near Jullundur in Punjab state near the border with Pakistan . 
defence analysts say the Prithvi -- with a 250-km ( 150-mile ) range -- is a worthy deterrent against India &apos;s regional rival Pakistan which is believed able to assemble nuclear weapons quickly . 
&quot; Indian foreign policy is independent and it has never tolerated outside interference , &quot; PTI quoted Gujral as saying when asked if the Prithvis were not being deployed following pressure from some Western countries . 
India will introduce the medium-range surface-to-air Akash missile to its air force in 1998 , PTI quoted defence scientists working on the project as saying . 
PTI quoted the scientists as saying that the ground support system of Akash had been fully developed and would be ready for induction by next year . 
India has sucessfully tested both the Prithvi and the Akash missiles .
