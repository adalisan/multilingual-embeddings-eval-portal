the Polish zloty edged upward against the currency basket in slow trade on Tuesday and dealers said the market &apos;s light pro-zloty sentiment may push the local unit into battle with the central bank later today . 
dealers said the central bank was likely to stage currency buying intervention if the zloty strayed too far above its enforced resistance level of 1.5 percent from the parity rate . 
&quot; Right now trade is light and guided mainly by dollar / mark moves ... but the zloty may quietly creep into intervention territory later today , &quot; said Adam Roeske , forex dealer at Bank Gdanski SA . 
at 0900 GMT the zloty was at 1.53 / 1.50 percent from parity , slightly stronger that 1.51 / 1.44 percent at opening . 
it was at 3.2180 / 90 to the dollar , flat from opening &apos;s 3.2175 / 00 and at 1.8802 / 10 to the mark , up from 1.8815 / 30 . 
the central bank chief Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz said late on Monday that she was not unhappy about the zloty &apos;s one percent weakening since late May , sparked by the Czech crown &apos;s fall , but did not comment on future movements of the zloty . 
Gronkiewicz-Waltz also reenforced market expectiations by saying that a change in interest rates was unlikely in the near-term as credit growth remained problematic , dealers said . 
one-day rates on the money market held steady around 22.3 percent as the market remained balanced , dealers said . 
overnight rates were at 22.15 / 22.40 percent against opening &apos;s 22.15 / 22.35 percent and tomorrow / next rates were at 22.20 / 22.50 percent against 22.20 / 22.50 percent .
