U.S. West Coast crude prices continued yesterday &apos;s decline in early Friday discussion , tracking a drop in West Texas Intermediate , as local spot trade faded ahead of the weekend , traders said . 
buyers were sidelined after three deals tightened the discount for Alaska North Slope ( ANS ) crude this week . 
&quot; It &apos;s a surprising amount , &quot; a dealer said , adding he thought fewer deals would be done with several local refiners going into turnaround during January . 
Alyeska , operator of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System , said Thursday a loaded ship weighing more than 150,000 dead-weight tonnes could not leave Alaska &apos;s Port of Valdez , until high winds abated . 
&quot; We &apos;re still making our delivery windows , &quot; said a trader for a key Alaskan producer . 
a cargo of San Joaquin Valley heavy crude was bought earlier this week at 15 cents below postings , and traders saw the next deal getting done around 25 under , with supply ample as refineries head into turnaround season .
