Belgian bonds moved higher with Bunds in thin trading on Thursday , reversing the previous session &apos;s weakness and given a boost by Germany &apos;s March IFO business climate index which was lower than forecast . 
but with an absence of major U.S. ecnonimc data for the next few days plus a monthly auction coming up next Monday , OLOs were expected to remain range bound in the short term . 
&quot; There are no buyers because yields are too low and no sellers either , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; buyers will only be interested when the ( 10-year ) yield gets up to 6.10 percent . 
this was just below Wednesday &apos;s close at 5.96 percent , and the spread over Germany remained steady at 12 basis points . 
dealers said there was so far little interest being expressed for the new January 2000 OLO to be auction on Monday . 
the current 10-year benchmark will also be on offer . 
&quot; People were interested in having a new five-year OLO at par because the current one is too expensive . 
but we could eventually see some switching into the new OLO from short term paper , &quot; one added .
