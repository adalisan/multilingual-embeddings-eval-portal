Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s warning on Wednesday that U.S. short-term interest rates may head higher to keep inflation in check boosted the dollar to a firmer close , currency experts said . 
during his semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins address , Greenspan was decidedly optimistic about prospects for economic growth , but he repeated twice that the Fed may need to hike rates . 
&quot; He was upbeat on the growth prospects for the U.S. economy and warned that the risks were for higher rates rather than lower rates , &quot; said Foreign Exchange analytics currency analyst Keith Woodfin . 
&quot; That bodes well for the dollar . 
Greenspan also reiterated an earlier warning against excessive gains in the stock market . 
the last time the Fed tightened credit was on February 1 , 1995 , when the central bank raised the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to six percent to contain inflation . 
U.S. interest rates have remained well above those in Japan and Germany , a factor that has already enhanced the dollar &apos;s appeal compared to the currencies of those countries . 
initially , the dollar slid as Greenspan &apos;s remarks sent stock and bond prices tumbling , but the dollar rebounded . 
traders said the rally picked up steam as previously set orders to buy dollars were triggered . 
on Wednesday , the dollar surged nearly two pfennigs to 1.6938 marks and more than one yen to 122.63 yen . 
profit-taking emerged as the dollar neared its highs for the day , causing the currency to retreat , traders said . 
the dollar closed at 1.6905 / 10 marks and 122.16 / 26 yen , up from 1.6745 / 50 marks and 121.17 / 27 yen at the open . 
the Dow Jones industrial stock average was off more than 120 points earlier in the day and closed down 55 points at 6983.18 . 
the next meeting of Fed policy makers is on March 25 , with subsequent meetings on May 20 and July 2 . 
experts doubted the Fed would hike rates in March , but some predicted the central bank might tighten monetary policy later in the year . 
indeed , Greenspan said Fed policy makers have taken care not to act prematurely , despite having indicated since last July they are considering raising official interest rates . 
&quot; I think March 25 is too early , &quot; said Doug Lee , an assistant vice president of foreign exchange at Sakura Bank Ltd . 
&quot; I would think by mid-year we should see a preemptive rate hike by the Fed , Lee said . 
&quot; As we head towards that , the dollar should benefit . 
despite the dollar &apos;s impressive gains on Wednesday , some currency experts doubted the dollar would continue higher in Asian trade . 
&quot; People rode it up and made some money , and just don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be able to continue or extend these gains over the rest of the day or even overnight , &quot; said Richard Vullo , a vice president at Hypobank . 
in other trade , the dollar closed at 1.4790 / 00 Swiss francs , up from 1.4622 / 32 francs at the open . 
sterling slid to $ 1.6330 / 40 from $ 1.6385 / 90 . 
the Australian dollar ended at $ 0.7765 / 70 , up from $ 0.7750 / 55 at the open .
