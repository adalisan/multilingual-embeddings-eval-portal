although the arbitrage to the U.S. remains open for high sulphur cargoes , no transatlantic trade was heard done and low sulphur material was still well offered . 
high sulphur barges traded early in the morning at $ 119 for December delivery and later at $ 118 . 
around midday barges were offered at $ 120 , but there were no takers . 
November material found buyers at $ 117 and $ 118 . 
high sulphur cargoes were steady hovering around $ 112-114 fob NWE level , with end-user buyers still reluctant to take product at these levels . 
low sulphur product was looking better supplied despite the thinning seen last week when 250,000 tonnes was taken out of the market . 
at least five suppliers had December material amounting to around 160,000 tonnes . 
dealers said they expected most cargoes to find their way into the Mediterranean . 
&quot; That was just a top up and the price was above the market , &quot; said one trader . 
dealers said wet prices were a touch above paper which traded on Wednesday at $ 131 first half December .
