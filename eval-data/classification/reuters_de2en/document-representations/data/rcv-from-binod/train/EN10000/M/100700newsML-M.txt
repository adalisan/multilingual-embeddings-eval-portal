Israeli bonds were stable on Monday after rising in the last few weeks , but traders said they fear there will be a correction soon . 
indices : 
* Government bonds general : -0.0 to 167.49 
* Dollar-linked government bonds : -0.2 PCT to 164.02 
* Unlinked government bonds ( Gilon - issued for four years ) : + 0.1 PCT to 165.42 
* Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills : 0.0 to 157.55 
&quot; A correction has to happen , &quot; said Roy Meir of Simodan portfolio managers . 
&quot; There were demands for long-term CPI-linked bonds today while people were selling short-term CPI-linked bonds . 
people are exchanging short term bonds for long term ones because they expect a cut in interest rates in the short term . 
&quot; Prices in the CPI-linked bonds have been on the rise lately because there is not enough supply of these bonds . 
it appears the government is not raising the money it needs to finance its budget deficit and provident funds have stopped selling bonds , which causes a rise in prices . 
Meir said there are two differing expectations in the market . 
one that inflation will rise , the other that interest rates are set to fall . 
&quot; Expectations for a rise in inflation are causing long-term CPI-linked bond prices to rise but at the same time expectations for a cut in interest rates in the short term are causing demand for unlinked bonds to remain high , &quot; Meir said . 
&quot; There is a worry in the market that the rises in the CPI-linked bonds will stop and a wave of profit taking is expected , &quot; said a trader . 
note : Provident funds , long-term savings funds with tax benefits , had been dumping bonds to meet massive public redemptions . 
Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year . 
the Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity .
