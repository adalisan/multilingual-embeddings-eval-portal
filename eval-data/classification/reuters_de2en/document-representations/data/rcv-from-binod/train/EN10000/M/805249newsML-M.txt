government securities dealers forecast a slight rise in OFZ bond prices . 
&quot; During the month left before massive OFZ sales due to an early repayment of the series 24007 bond , OFZs have a chance to rise a bit , &quot; Aljba-Alliance Bank dealer Mikhail Vasilyev said . 
on September 10 , the Finance Ministry plans to repay early up to 3.61 trillion roubles on series 24007 OFZ bond and will offer large amounts of new bonds to replace them . 
dealers said OFZ bonds prices had fallen low enough to become attractive to buy , but the excess of paper already held by investors , who fear a further price fall and are unwilling to sell , prevented them from rising . 
on the foreign exchange market , overnight credit rates opened at 13-16 percent , but rouble demand from a big bank pushed the rates to 19-21 percent , a Mezhkombank dealer said , forecasting a further growth of the rouble . 
he said the demand was connected to rouble purchases after privatisation auctions and even an inflow of fresh funds from the government securities market did not help .
