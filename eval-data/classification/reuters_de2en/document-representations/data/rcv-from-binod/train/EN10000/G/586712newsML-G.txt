Federal prosecutors said Thursday they would seek the death penalty for Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski if he is convicted . 
in court papers filed in U.S. District Court in Sacramento , prosecutors said that &quot; a sentence of death is justified and ... the United States will seek the death penalty &quot; if Kaczynski is convicted . 
Kaczynski , a 54-year-old former mathematics professor , is accused of being the shadowy Unabomber , who killed three people and injured 23 during an anti-technology bombing campaign between 1978 and 1995 . 
Kaczynski has been charged in Sacramento with four bomb attacks between 1985 and 1995 that killed timber industry lobbyist Gilbert Murray and computer store owner Hugh Scrutton and injured two prominent scientists . 
in the four-page filing , prosecutors said they would seek the death penalty if Kaczynski is convicted of any of the capital offenses relating to Murray &apos;s death . 
they said the death penalty was justified because Kaczynski &quot; intentionally killed the victim &quot; and &quot; intentionally inflicted serious bodily injury that resulted in the death of the victim . 
&quot; Kaczynski , who was arrested in Montana in April last year , has pleaded not guilty to the Sacramento charges . 
his trial is due to start in November .
