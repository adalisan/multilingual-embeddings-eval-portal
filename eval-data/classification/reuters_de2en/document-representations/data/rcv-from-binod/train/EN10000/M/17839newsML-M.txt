Simex Nikkei futures ended little changed on Tuesday after moving within narrow ranges , said dealers . 
Nikkei futures edged up in the morning but gave back most of their gains in the afternoon session . 
&quot; It was quite a boring day with the Nikkei moving within a 200-point range , &quot; said a dealer with an Asian futures firm . 
&quot; Much of the activity was by scalpers . 
I don &apos;t think there is much real institutional interest out there . 
September Nikkei settled at 20,945 against its previous close of 20,920 . 
volume was 17,855 contracts . 
December ended at 20,970 against a previous of 20,945 on volume of 7,860 contracts . 
dealers said market participants continued to roll over their contracts from September to December .
