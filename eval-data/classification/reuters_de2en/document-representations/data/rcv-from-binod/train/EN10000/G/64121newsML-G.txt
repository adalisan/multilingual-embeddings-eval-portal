Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa rejected opposition accusations during a censure debate on Thursday that had amassed land during his tenure and was guilty of plagiarism while writing his master &apos;s thesis . 
&quot; My family and I own not more than 1,200 RAI ( about 500 hectares ) . 
he had been accused by the opposition of amassing thousands of hectares of land . 
the no-confidence motion against Barharn , which opened on Wednesday , is set to last until Friday . 
the opposition has also accused Barharn of mismanaging Thailand &apos;s economy , charges he has previously denied but not yet responded to during the debate . 
Banharn &apos;s six-party coalition has been in power for 14 months . 
his coalition controls 209 of the 391 seats in parliament . 
political analysts say Banharn would survive the no-confidence vote unless some coalition partners were swayed by the accusations and abandoned him . 
Banharn also told parliament that Ramkamhaeng University , which awarded him the masters degree in law , had repeatedly confirmed it accepted his work . 
&quot; Under a standard practice for writing theses , the papers can be similar in general but their summaries must be unique , &quot; he said during the televised debate . 
earlier , MP Surin Pitsuwan of the main opposition Democrat Party , had accused Banharn of plagiarism , lacking ethics and copying a thesis on the same subject written by a government minister Pokin Polakul . 
&quot; Everything is the same as in the research of your advisor ( Pokin ) . 
the only thing that is different is the cover which carries the name Banharn on it , &quot; he said . 
the opposition also raised doubts about Banharn &apos;s nationality on Thursday . 
an opposition MP claimed , waving documents , that the premier &apos;s father emigrated from China to Thailand in 1937 , while Banharn &apos;s birth certificate indicated he was born in his hometown of Suphan Buri in 1932 . 
Thai law states that only Thai citizens can stand for elections to parliament or be prime minister of the country . 
Banharn has yet to respond in parliament but said earlier this year when similar questions were raised that registration officials may have filled in the documents incorrectly . 
the Thai stock market and baht were firmer despite the accusations made against Banharn . 
the stock index closed up 9.83 points at 1047.86 while the baht firmed against a weakening U.S. dollar to 25.361-25.364 in late Thursday trade from 25.365-25.368 in the morning . 
Banharn &apos;s administration has been hurt by an economic slowdown , sluggish export growth , a battered stock market that sank last week to near three-year-lows and a run on the baht by offshore investors after devaluation rumours .
