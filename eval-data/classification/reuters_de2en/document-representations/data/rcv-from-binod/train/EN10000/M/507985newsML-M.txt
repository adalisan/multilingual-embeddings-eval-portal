Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka vowed Monday to act decisively against &quot; excessive &quot; movements in the currency market but sidestepped the question of what exchange rate would trigger a response . 
&quot; The recent movements of the yen ( against the dollar ) have clearly been overdone , and I am concerned about it , &quot; Mitsuzuka told a news conference . 
&quot; ( Monetary authorities ) will act decisively at an appropriate time against such excessive moves in the foreign exchange market , &quot; he added . 
Mitsuzuka said market intervention was naturally one option to deal with excessive currency movements . 
but he denied that he had told fellow cabinet members last week that 127-128 yen to the dollar was the level at which action was required , and refused to be drawn on what rate would prompt the Bank of Japan to step in to prop up its currency . 
media reports on Saturday said Mitsuzuka had told other cabinet ministers on Friday that Japan must act if the dollar rises to 127-128 yen . 
&quot; Neither I nor other cabinet ministers have made any specific references to intervention levels , &quot; Mitsuzuka said . 
foreign exchange markets grew wary about possible Japanese central bank intervention to support the anaemic yen last Thursday , when Mitsuzuka said recent moves were excessive . 
traders say they expect the Bank of Japan to sell dollars and buy yen if the U.S. currency rises again , but they add that other central banks , including the U.S. Federal Reserve , are not likely to act in concert with Tokyo . 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Thursday that he shared Japan &apos;s concern about the yen &apos;s recent fall , but also reiterated that a strong dollar was in U.S. interests -- comments traders took to mean Washington would be happy to see Japan intervene alone but was reluctant to use its own money . 
asked Monday if he expected the United States and other Group of Seven partners to intervene with Japan , Mitsuzuka simply said that Japan was in close contact with U.S. authorities . 
Bank of Japan Governor Yasuo Matsushita also told a group of business leaders Monday that recent currency movements were &quot; somewhat too rapid &quot; and that the central bank would keep watch on the trend . 
Japanese finance officials are worried that the yen &apos;s latest slide will fan economic friction with Washington , although some trade officials admit that for now at least , the yen &apos;s weakness helps the economy more than it hurts . 
Mitsuzuka , however , reiterated another of his recent refrains , insisting that Japan had no intention of exporting its way out of domestic economic woes -- a reference to U.S. worries that Tokyo &apos;s current account surplus will surge again due to exports made more price-competitive by the yen &apos;s fall . 
&quot; Japan will not use exports as the price locomotive for growth , &quot; Mitsuzuka said . 
&quot; Instead , the country is carrying out balanced management of economic policies that emphasises achieving sustainable growth led by private-sector demand . 
the dollar , which last week went above 127 yen for the first time in 56 months , was trading at around 126.42 yen Monday afternoon in Tokyo . 
in early U.S. trading , the dollar was unchanged at 1.7215 German marks and nearly flat at 126.18 yen .
