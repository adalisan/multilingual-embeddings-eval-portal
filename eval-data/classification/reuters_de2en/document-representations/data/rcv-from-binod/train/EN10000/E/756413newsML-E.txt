Zambian President Frederick Chiluba on Friday forecast that annual inflation in his southern African nation would fall to single digits by next year , compared with 35 percent now . 
Chiluba told a news conference at the end of a three-day state visit to the Indian ocean islands that sweeping western-backed economic reforms had rejuvenated his country &apos;s once dying economy . 
Chiluba , a former trade unionist who ousted veteran African politician Kenneth Kaunda in pluralist elections in 1991 , said a tough dose of medicine had managed to reverse inflation from 300 percent in 1992 to 200 percent in 1993 and an impressive 35 percent at present . 
&quot; We have struggled hard to come down to a 2-digit rate , &quot; Chiluba said . 
he added : &quot; We inherited social , economic and financial problems which were results of misguided policies and mismanagement of the economy by the previous government over 27 years . 
Kaunda , who led Zambia to independence from British rule in 1964 , presided over a central command socialist economic system and nationalised the copper mines -- Zambia &apos;s mainstay . 
but Chiluba has since embarked on one of Africa &apos;s most sweeping privatisation programmes that has seen state-owned conglomerates privatised or completely liquidated . 
&quot; I am implementing one of the most far reaching and successful privatisation programmes on the continent , &quot; he told the news conference . 
he forecast economic growth would rebound to 5.5 percent by the end of this year from negative figures at present . 
Chiluba said his visit to Mauritius centred on wooing investment and creating Mauritian-type opportunities in Zambia , particularly for agriculture . 
he also encouraged Mauritian business concerns to invest in Zambia &apos;s copper mines , which are due to be privatised later this year . 
the giant Zambia Consolidated copper Mines ( ZCCM ) is the country &apos;s biggest foreign exchange earner with annual copper output in its best years of more than 400,000 tonnes .
