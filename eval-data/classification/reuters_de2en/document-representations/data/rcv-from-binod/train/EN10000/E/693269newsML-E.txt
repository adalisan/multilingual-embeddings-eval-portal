stronger foreign trade pushed the economy ahead at an even faster clip than previously thought in the first quarter this year , the Commerce Department said on Friday . 
the department revised its estimate of growth in gross domestic product up fractionally to a booming 5.9 percent annual rate in the three months from January through March from the 5.8 percent rate it published a month ago . 
it was the most robust economic performance in more than nine years , since GDP expanded at a 6 percent rate in the final three months of 1987 , and far exceeded the 3.8 percent rate of expansion recorded in last year &apos;s final quarter . 
growth has since slowed substantially as consumers have trimmed their spending , which fuels two-thirds of national economic activity . 
most analysts anticipate GDP growth at only around 2 percent to 2.5 percent in the second quarter . 
GDP measures the value of all goods and services produced by workers and capital within the nation &apos;s borders . 
commerce initially estimated it grew at a 5.6 percent rate , then boosted that to 5.8 percent and finally to 5.9 percent . 
an estimate of second-quarter performance will not be available for another month . 
the GDP report is one of the final pieces of economic information available before the Federal Reserve &apos;s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets next Tuesday and Wednesday to plot interest-rate strategy . 
the Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged amid evidence the economy &apos;s growth pace has slowed on its own during the second quarter and therefore does not need stiffer interest rates to restrain it . 
the revised GDP figures showed that trade was less of a drag on the economy in the first quarter than previously estimated , mainly because imports grew at a lower rate of $ 44.7 billion instead of $ 51.6 billion as estimated a month ago . 
that more than offset slightly weaker production for inventories . 
businesses increased their stocks of goods at a $ 48.6 billion annual rate during the first quarter rather than the more robust $ 51.4 billion estimated a month ago . 
production for inventories boosts overall GDP in the period in which it happens , so the revised lower total subtracts from the pace of expansion . 
personal consumption spending also was not quite as brisk as thought . 
instead of growing at a $ 66.2 billion annual rate , as estimated a month ago , it went up at a $ 65.5 billion pace . 
there was little or no sign of price pressures . 
the GDP report &apos;s implicit price deflator advanced at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter , the same as previously estimated . 
the fixed-weights measure of price changes rose a smaller 2.7 percent instead of 2.8 percent as previously estimated . 
businesses made bountiful profits amid the surging economic conditions , as profits from current production fattened at an annual rate of $ 42.4 billion in the first quarter to $ 712.5 billion . 
the department said it was the strongest pickup in profitability for any three months in more than a decade , since a $ 49.2-billion rate of growth in the third quarter of 1985 .
