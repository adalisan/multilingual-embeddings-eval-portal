an Ohio woman said to be suffering from an illness that drives people to harm others in order to attract attention has been convicted of killing three of her four babies . 
Ramona Douglas , 31 , was found guilty by a judge on Monday in Cuyahoga County Common pleas Court after she pleaded no contest to aggravated murder charges in the 1988 , 1991 and 1994 deaths . 
Douglas , who could face 60 years to life in prison , will be sentenced next March . 
it was the first time Munchausen Syndrome by proxy was admissible as a motive in a murder case in Ohio , assistant Cuyahoga County prosecutor melody White told Reuters . 
&quot; The label is applied to parents who either cause or fabricate some type of illness in their children to get attention or sympathy from the medical community for themselves . 
they use their kids to fulfil their own need for attention . 
White said all three babies died of suffocation -- Elizabeth in 1988 at seven weeks , Cameron in 1991 at six weeks and Shannon in 1994 at nine weeks . 
Douglas denied in court that she killed her children and , in televised comments , warned mothers to have evidence to protect themselves if their children get sick and die . 
White said Douglas had claimed two children died of illness and the other was killed by an unknown intruder . 
her attorneys could not be reached for comment immediately . 
a fourth child , Josiah , has been in foster care since his birth in January , when the prosecution &apos;s case against Douglas was already under way , White said .
