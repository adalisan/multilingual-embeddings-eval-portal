Brazil will have a record trade deficit of about $ 5.2 billion in 1996 , more than double the target set at the start of the year , the Jornal do Brasil newspaper said on Saturday . 
it said December trade figures were expected to increase the deficit by $ 1.5 billion , the largest monthly shortfall of the year , exceeding the $ 1.31 billion deficit of October . 
in November the deficit was a much smaller $ 853,000 . 
&quot; From here on , we will have monthly deficits in the order of $ 800 million to $ 1 billion . 
this pattern ... is only likely to change in two years &apos; time when exports increase , &quot; Helio Mauro franca , director of the foreign trade policy department of the Industry and Commerce Ministry , told the newspaper . 
the estimated year-end result did not surprise economists given the recent rise in imports and a drop in exports . 
&quot; One month they said it was because of petroleum imports , then it was because of a delay in loading at the port of Santos . 
soon they will be saying that it was the fault of panetone , &quot; Affonso Celso Pastore , a former Central Bank chief , told the newspaper . 
Panetone is a special bread traditionally eaten by Brazilians over the Christmas period . 
Pastore said Brazil &apos;s trade deficit could grow in 1997 to between $ 8.2 and $ 12.6 billion if the government did not change its economic policy .
