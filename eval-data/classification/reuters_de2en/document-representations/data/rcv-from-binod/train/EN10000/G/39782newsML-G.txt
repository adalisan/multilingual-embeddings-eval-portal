while mere mortals make do with clothes , Buddha must be clad in gold , according to a Chinese saying . 
visitors to the Shaoshan Mao family restaurant in Beijing could hardly miss the life-size bust of Mao Zedong sprayed with gold paint on an altar adorned with artificial flowers facing the front door . 
twenty years after his death , the Great helmsman , who in 1958 launched the catastrophic Great leap Forward campaign that starved 28 million people to death in a man-made famine , is still revered by millions in China as god or demi-god . 
many of us bow ( before the statue ) every day , &quot; Li Jun , manager of the Mao restaurant , said in an interview . 
until a recent ban by Beijing authorities to curb superstition , the restaurant would cook Mao &apos;s favourite dishes every day and offer them as sacrificial food before the statue , flanked by candles and littered with small change offerings . 
despite unleashing the 1966-76 ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution that plunged China into turmoil , Mao is still respectfully referred to by millions in China simply as &quot; chairman &quot; of the Communist Party . 
Mao fever subsided in the first few years after his death on September 9 , 1976 , but has revived in recent years . 
pictures of Mao still are thought by many to ward off evil spirits . 
they hang from the rear view mirrors of many vehicles as an amulet against accidents and adorn the walls of many homes . 
farmers in Jingbian county in the northern province of Shaanxi spent 100,000 yuan ( $ 12,000 ) of their own money to build a temple to Mao . 
the average income of Jingbian county residents was 650 yuan ( $ 78 ) each in 1995 . 
a huge portrait of Mao gazes over Tiananmen Square in central Beijing , where Mao declared the founding of the republic on October 1 , 1949 . 
long queues are a frequent sight outside the mausoleum , where Mao &apos;s embalmed body lies in a crystal coffin . 
an average of one million people flock to Shaoshan village in the central Chinese province of Hunan each year for a glimpse of the place where he was born . 
&quot; Personally , I &apos;m a worshipper of Mao Zedong , &quot; said Chen Zhenxing , a historian at a private think-tank . 
&quot; I ... think he &apos;s a leader of the people , speaks for the people and does things for the people , &quot; Chen told Reuters . 
to many , Mao symbolises a golden age of Chinese communism , a period of idealism and crime-free streets in the years after Mao &apos;s ragtag Red Army defeated Chiang Kai-shek &apos;s corrupt Nationalists and swept to power in 1949 . 
superstition and other centuries-old scourges were also virtually eliminated . 
but Mao was not infallible . 
Mao presided over three decades of social chaos and ruled with a combination of personality cult and political terror . 
during the Cultural Revolution , schools were closed and radical Red Guards went on a rampage , destroying temples , Buddhist statues and works of arts , and trashing anything that smacked of tradition . 
thousands of people were hounded to death in rounds of &quot; class struggle &quot; that Mao said would cleanse China of &quot; rightists &quot; and &quot; counter-revolutionaries . 
&quot; The ordinary Chinese think Mao Zedong committed a lot of mistakes , especially during the Cultural Revolution when he brought China to the brink of collapse , &quot; said Xu Youyu , of the philosophy institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences . 
&quot; But with the gap between the rich and the poor widening in recent years , the people are seeking social justice ... and Mao stood for justice , &quot; Xu said . 
the official assessment of Mao is that he committed &quot; mistakes &quot; in his later life but that these are outweighed by his &quot; contributions &quot; in leading the revolution to success . 
Mao &apos;s death gave rise to market reforms , which after almost two decades have eroded communist puritanism and debunked almost all of what Mao stood for . 
in China &apos;s rush to get rich , many businessmen -- who would have been purged and struggled against during the Cultural Revolution -- have cashed in on Mao &apos;s legacy . 
more than 40 Mao restaurants have mushroomed across Beijing , something that would have made the chairman -- a devoted Marxist -- turn in his grave . 
the Shaoshan Mao family restaurant boasts cooks from Mao &apos;s birthplace , and the waitresses speak with Mao &apos;s unmistakable Hunan accent . 
pop music singing the praises of Mao blares from loudspeakers . 
Chinese calligraphy of poems by Mao and blown-up black and white historical pictures of him hang from the walls . 
little red books containing quotable quotes by Mao are on display in a glass encasement . 
customers are given souvenir lapel pins bearing his profile . 
the restaurant &apos;s best seller is Mao &apos;s favourite dish -- pork braised in brown sauce with either garlic or chestnuts . 
Mao was said to have once said : &quot; ( Give me ) a bowl of braised pork a day and ( I ) will defeat Chiang Kai-shek in three years . 
he became depressed after learning of the famine created by his Great leap Forward campaign , in which he urged farmers to abandon their fields to make steel in their backyards . 
Mao then reportedly abstained from his favourite dish for years , apparently to atone for his blunder .
