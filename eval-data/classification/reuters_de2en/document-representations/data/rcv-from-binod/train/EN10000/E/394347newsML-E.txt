the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority selected Bear , Stearns &amp; Co , Merrill Lynch &amp; Co and John Nuveen &amp; Co on Friday to lead the agency &apos;s housing bond issues over the next three years . 
Fritz RUF , the authority &apos;s executive director , said that Bear Stearns and Merrill will rotate as senior manager for single-family loan program issues , while Nuveen will head multi-family loan program issues . 
Robert W. Baird &amp; Co and Nuveen will also serve as co-managers on single-family deals , RUF added . 
RUF estimated that the agency would be selling $ 300 million to $ 400 million of single-family loan program bonds and $ 100 million to $ 150 million of multi-family loan program bonds this year . 
most of the firms selected by the authority &apos;s board had worked on authority issues over the last few years along with Goldman Sachs &amp; Co , which was not selected for a permanent slot on upcoming bond issues , he said . 
&quot; The proposals for the most part were very good , &quot; RUF said . 
&quot; It wasn &apos;t easy for us . 
the board also gave RUF the power to select other co-managers and selling group members for future bond issues with the stipulation that one of the firms must be minority-owned .
