Russia &apos;s troubled space station Mir on Wednesday undocked from its Progress supply ship to make room for a relief crew to arrive on Thursday , an official at Mission Control said . 
the Progress T-35 delivered oxygen , food , water and tools to Mir on July 7 after the space station collided with a previous supply ship on June 25 in the worst accident in its history . 
the Progress will orbit the Earth until August 15 when the departure of the current crew will allow it to redock with Mir . 
&quot; The undocking took place on schedule , &quot; a Mission Control spokesman told Reuters shortly after the 1145 GMT operation . 
the seven-metre ( 23-feet ) long , 7,200 kilo ( 15,800 pound ) Progress T-35 is now mostly filled with garbage . 
space officials said undocking the Progress would create a parking space for cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyov and flight engineer Pavel Vinogradov , who blasted off from Earth on Tuesday and are expected to arrive in their Soyuz TM-26 capsule at Mir on Thursday shortly after 1700 GMT . 
Solovyov and Vinogradov will carry out repairs crucial to the future of the 11-year-old space station , which has problems with its oxygen system and has been working on only partial power since the June 25 collision . 
the two Russian cosmonauts currently on board Mir , Vasily Tsibliyev and Alexander Lazutkin , will return to Earth on August 14 after half a year in orbit . 
officials will attempt the August 15 redocking of Progress in automatic rather than the manual pilot used in the disastrous June 25 docking .
