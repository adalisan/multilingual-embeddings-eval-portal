Danish share prices showed little movement in Friday &apos;s opening trade and dealers expected sparse business in a session sandwiched between Thursday &apos;s Ascension Day holiday and the weekend . 
&quot; All the indications are for a very quiet day , &quot; a dealer said . 
one of the few top-20 shares moving was SAS , which was up 1.90 crowns to 68.00 . 
the carrier &apos;s share plunged 3.90 crowns on Wednesday , after it surprised the market with first-quarter losses .
