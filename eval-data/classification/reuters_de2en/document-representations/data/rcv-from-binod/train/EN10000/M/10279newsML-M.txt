Zimbabwe shares rose to a record high on Friday because of lower interest rates and improved inflation prospects , traders said . 
the market ignored a continuing strike by thousands of civil servants and the key 57-share index rose 95.85 points , or 1.7 percent , to close at a record 5,675.17 . 
&quot; The market was bullish in keeping with expectations in an environment where inflation and interest rates are coming down , &quot; one broker said . 
a market official and share analysts forecast the market will rise further in the next few months as interest rates fall following a central bank cut in a key lending rate . 
the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe ( RBZ ) said on Thursday it had lowered its rediscount rate to 27.5 percent from 29.5 percent with effect from Tuesday , citing a fall in annual inflation . 
it last brought down the rate in November 1994 when it eased it to 29.5 percent from 30 percent but had since maintained a tight monetary policy to fight resurgent annual inflation -- pegged at 22 percent in July from 28 percent in January . 
&quot; It &apos;s welcome news for the stock market and will have a softening effect on lending rates which will be a boost for stocks as people will more likely move funds from the money market to shares , &quot; Richard Chitumba , an investment expert with share market analysts Dataworld , told Reuters . 
the good news on interest rates was offset by a continuing strike by civil servants pressing for wage rises of between 30 and 60 percent . 
representatives of thousands of strikers , emboldened by strong public support , said on Friday they would remain on the streets despite government threats to sack them . 
but the share market focused on interest rates . 
Zimbabwe Stock Exchange chief executive Anthony Barfoot said there was already &quot; a lot of activity &quot; and share prices were high . 
&quot; It ( the RBZ cut ) is likely to push the value of the shares higher because companies should be able to make better profits , &quot; he said . 
the key industrial index , which has been rising steadily this week on foreign buying , ended Thursday 7.77 points up at 5,579.32 . 
stock and money market analyst and columnist Charles Gurney said with falling interest rates , any double digit dividend yield should be able to offer value . 
he said the gap between the rediscount and market rates had become &quot; glaringly large &quot; and had limited a recent slide to the lower 20s in short-term trading rates on the money market . 
&quot; counters that are highly geared yet able to exploit the resurgence in economic growth will benefit from the interest rate cuts , &quot; said Nigel Chanakira , another share market analyst . 
Zimbabwean industrialists have been complaining that punitive borrowing rates of over 30 percent were frustrating expansion plans and eroding profit margins . 
on Thursday , the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries ( CZI ) said the rate cut would bolster the country &apos;s fragile economic recovery from a drought which depressed growth in 1995 .
