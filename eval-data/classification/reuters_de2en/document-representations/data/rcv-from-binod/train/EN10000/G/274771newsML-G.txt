a cathedral in northern Argentina has had to remove a nativity scene in which the holy family were represented with the features of Andean Indians after protests from local society women and threats of arson . 
the nativity scene presented a life-size baby Jesus , Mary and Joseph modelled in styrofoam with the same dark faces as many of the local inhabitants of the city of salta . 
but the Clarin newspaper reported that a group of 15 women from local wealthy families wrote to Catholic authorities demanding the scene be taken out of salta Cathedral , where it was first shown in 1993 . 
it was removed and installed in a shopping mall after anonymous telephoned threats of arson . 
while most Argentines are of European descent , there are a significant number of native Indians , particularly in the country &apos;s sparsely populated and impoverished north .
