the Bundesbank said on Thursday its council left the German discount and Lombard rates unchanged after its regular meeting . 
the German discount rate remains at 2.50 percent and the Lombard emergency financing rate at 4.50 percent . 
the central bank &apos;s main money market rate , the repo , was also held at three percent . 
all 10 economists polled in a Reuter survey said the central bank had no need to change interest rates at present since there was no new convincing evidence that warranted a move in one direction or the other . 
a rate increase too soon would choke off what has been an unspectacular recovery this year while Bundesbank officials keep insisting that rates at their current historic lows do not stand in the way of an upturn , economists said . 
Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen said on Wednesday he would not rule out another reduction in Bundesbank interest rates in the present economic cycle but added that he did not see one .
