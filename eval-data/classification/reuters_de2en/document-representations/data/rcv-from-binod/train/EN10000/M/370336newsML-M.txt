precious metal markets firmed on Tuesday afternoon although profit-taking soon swept them from intraday highs . 
even gold came off its recent low struck earlier on Tuesday and was fixed in the afternoon at $ 339.40 per ounce . 
this was against an earlier $ 338.85 which was a fresh low from April 22 , 1993 . 
but the sector generally showed its vulnerability when the funds took their profits from recent gains by palladium and to a lesser degree silver . 
these metals had had the role of providing a relatively cheap entry to the sector for speculators over the past few days , dealers said . 
&quot; Silver had proved it could resist weakness in gold which made its upside look attractive and palladium was rising on the Russian issue . 
the funds like these kind of markets , &quot; one said . 
Russia , the major exporter , and Japan which is its principal customer , have yet to begin discussing their 1997 supply contract which has led consumers and , latterly , speculators to enter the free market . 
but palladium &apos;s rise of around nine dollars in the past four trading days tempted the speculators to cash in their gains on Tuesday . 
palladium was indicated at $ 131.50 / $ 132.50 shortly after the 1500 GMT gold fixes which was down from a day &apos;s high of $ 135.75 / $ 136.75 and a close on Monday of $ 135.25 / $ 136.25 . 
gold was pressured under good volume selling earlier , which some dealers said was either from a central bank or a major producer . 
at the same time borrowing rates climbed . 
&quot; With the amount of shorts in the market you would expect them to be higher than they are unless the shorts , for example are covered in the OTC ( over the counter ) market , &quot; an analyst said . 
others opined the one-month rate reflected gold being borrowed to be sold on behalf of a producer or a central bank . 
platinum was also off its day &apos;s high at $ 353.20 / $ 354.20 and down 30 cents from the close .

&quot; Gold &apos;s floor seems to have held for the moment against some good selling earlier which may be encouraging a bit of short covering , &quot; a dealer said .
