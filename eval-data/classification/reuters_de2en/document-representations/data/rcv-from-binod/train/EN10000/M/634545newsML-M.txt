India &apos;s Delhi Stock Exchange ( DSE ) plans to start a 90-minute evening trading session , a senior official of the exchange said on Tuesday . 
&quot; The government &apos;s policy decisions many times come late in the day , as do company results . 
why not open trading and let markets reflect these announcements immediately , &quot; S.S. Sodhi , chief executive officer , DSE , told Reuters . 
DSE plans to implement the second session of trading in the next several months , Sodhi said . 
Sodhi said that the evening session would increase trading volumes by between 20 percent to 25 percent . 
&quot; Many deals happen on the kerb , as there is no exchange open in the evenings . 
the more kerb deals we bring into the exchange , the better it is for the exchange , &quot; he said . 
at present , the trading volume of the DSE is in the region of 2.5 billion rupees to 3.0 billion rupees a day . 
Sodhi says that tradng volumes have steadily climbed since the introductio of online trading in March 1996 . 
&quot; What holds us back from reaching the seven billion rupee volumes of the Bombay Stock Exchange is that we don &apos;t have institutional buying in Delhi , &quot; he said . 
&quot; So we have to develop other USPs to attract investors to DSE . 
apart from plans for the evening session , which would be the first time for an Indian stock exchange , Sodhi said that DSE was also in the process of setting up a stock clearing corporation . 
a clearing corporation is a body that guarantees a trade , and makes payments to brokers selling if need be . 
this leads to an increase in the trading volume due to higher liquidity . 
&quot; The DSE Clearing Corporation Ltd will have a corpus of over one billion rupees , and should be operational by the end of the year , &quot; Sodhi said .
