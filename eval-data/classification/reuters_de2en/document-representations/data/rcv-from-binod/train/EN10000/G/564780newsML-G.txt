after more than 30 years in the &quot; little bit of country and a little bit of rock and roll &quot; business , Marie Osmond has moved on from child star to mother of five , theatre performer and savvy business woman . 
but she still exudes the wholesome goodness that was her trademark when she entered show business . 
&quot; I have lived an amazing life ... worked with just about everybody you can imagine , but there are not a lot of people who &apos;ve bridged the gap between child star and adult , &quot; Osmond said in an interview with Reuters . 
on tour to promote her performance as Maria in &quot; The Sound of Music &quot; , to be staged this year in Singapore , Thailand and Hong Kong , Osmond is planning to publish her autobiography in a couple of years &apos; time . 
over 30 years ago , Andy Williams hoisted up a pint-sized , dark haired toddler on to his lap in front of his weekly television show &apos;s millions of viewers and introduced her as &quot; the youngest Osmond Brother &quot; . 
the only daughter in the famous musical Mormon family from Utah did not follow six of her brothers into pop and rock . 
instead she made country music history at 13 by hitting the number one chart position with a debut record , &quot; Paper Roses &quot; . 
at 14 , she became the youngest person to co-host a weekly television variety series when she joined her brother on &quot; The Donny and Marie Show &quot; . 
after gaining a world-wide audience with the show &apos;s five-year run , Osmond headed for the quieter pastures of country music &apos;s Mecca , Nashville , to record hit country songs . 
but that did not stop her from marrying childhood sweetheart and basketball star Steve Craig in 1982 , a rocky relationship that ended in divorce three years later . 
&quot; There were just a lot of things about my life that were difficult ... 
having grown up in a family of nine children that still congregates at least once a year , Osmond married again in 1986 , this time to music producer and composer Brian Blosil . 
Osmond is now the mother of five children , whose ages range from four months to 14 years . 
she said she would encourage her children to follow in her show business tracks if they want to . 
she described proudly how her eldest son , Stephen , her only child from her first marriage , successfully auditioned for a role in the U.S. tour of &quot; The Sound of Music &quot; without anyone knowing he was her son . 
&quot; I feel very fortunate that I have been able to travel with them ( her children ) , continue working and growing myself , &quot; she said . 
&quot; My husband is supportive ... we really have a wonderful life , we have been very blessed . 
God has been good to me . 
she said her children were the inspiration for her autobiography . 
&quot; I just started doing it really for my children so they know their mother &apos;s life , &quot; said Osmond . 
&quot; My whole life has been hard , but I choose to be the kind of person that likes to see the glass half full , rather than half empty , &quot; she said . 
five years ago , Osmond discovered a love for sculpting porcelain doll figures , turning her passion into an award winning , $ 70 million collector doll business . 
before showing off her dolls for the cameras , one modelled on her mother as a baby and one of herself -- Baby Marie -- with her trademark beauty spot just by her right eye , Osmond quickly adjusts and preens the doll &apos;s hair . 
on a more serious side , Osmond is fiercely proud of co-founding the Children &apos;s Miracle Network , one of the largest fund raising charities in the world , raising well over $ 1 billion since 1983 for free health care for children . 
so can fans expect Osmond to reveal deep dark secrets in her autobiography ?
