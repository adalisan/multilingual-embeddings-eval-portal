the Hong Kong government said on Friday total exports rose by two percent in value terms to HK $ 314 billion in the first quarter of 1997 over a year earlier . 
&quot; As there was a modest decline in export prices , the increase in real terms was about four percent , only slightly below the five percent growth in the fourth quarter of 1996 , &quot; the government said in its First Quarter Economic Report 1997 . 
within this total , re-exports rose by four percent in value terms over a year earlier to HK $ 269.0 billion in the first quarter of 1997 . 
after discounting price changes , the growth rate in real terms was about five percent . 
this followed an eight percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1996 . 
domestic exports fell by six percent in value terms over a year earlier to HK $ 45 billion in the first quarter of 1997 . 
&quot; The decrease in real terms was about four percent , much less significant than the decline of 10 percent and seven percent in the preceding two quarters , &quot; the government said . 
the value of imports rose by four percent over a year earlier to HK $ 362 billion in the first quarter of 1997 . 
after netting out price changes , the increase in real terms was about six percent , the same as in the fourth quarter of 1996 . 
the government reported a visible trade deficit of HK $ 48.2 billion , equivalent to 13.3 percent of the value of imports in the first quarter of 1997 . 
corresponding figures in the first quarter of 1996 were HK $ 39.8 billion and 11.5 percent .
