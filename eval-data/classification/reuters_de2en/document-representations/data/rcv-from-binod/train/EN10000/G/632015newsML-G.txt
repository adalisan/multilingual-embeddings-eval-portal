Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan called for snap elections to resolve a row between his Islamist-led coalition and Turkey &apos;s secularist generals , but the way forward was not immediately clear . 
no date was set for polling and there were no guarantees that a complicated handover of power would not go awry and give the opposition a chance to set up its own secularist government . 
Erbakan , the first Islamist to head the government of modern Turkey , committed himself to stepping down in favour of coalition ally Tansu Ciller , a secular conservative , within a month as part of a deal to go for early elections . 
&quot; The election can be held in a short time by updating the electoral roll . 
I don &apos;t think there will be a need for a long process , &quot; he said . 
Erbakan must first give his resignation to President Suleyman Demirel , a veteran of the volatile political scene in Turkey , a secular state with an overwhelmingly Moslem population . 
according to political tradition , Demirel , an avowed secularist , should nominate the party leader with the most members of parliament to produce a feasible cabinet list . 
Erbakan , whose Islam-based Welfare Party has 159 deputies , is likely to get the task and choose a cabinet with Ciller as prime minister to steer the country into elections . 
but in practice any government headed by Ciller , whose reputation has been damaged by corruption allegations , would face a major obstacle in trying to survive a vote of confidence within days of taking over . 
the present coalition government , battered by anti-Islamist defections , lost its absolute majority last week and now has 275 deputies in the 550-seat chamber . 
Ciller should be sure of the Welfare Party votes but a current effort to recruit seven far-right deputies to her side could easily be cancelled out by further defections to the opposition from her True Path Party . 
similarly , an election law to fix the poll date could run into trouble in the national assembly without the support of the opposition . 
many deputies from all parties are reluctant to see fresh polls in case they lose their parliamentary privileges . 
it was also unclear which parties might profit fron elections . 
the Welfare Party is widely believed to have increased its share of the vote since it polled 21 percent in general elections at the end of 1995 , but few reliable opinion polls have been published recently . 
press reports say Erbakan wants a quick poll but Ciller , a U.S.-trained economist , is holding out for a date next year . 
elections would not normally be due until the year 2000 . 
the Welfare Party itself stands accused of threatening Turkey &apos;s secular system and could be closed down if it loses the case in the constitutional courts in about six months time . 
the case was part of an assault on the Islamists by the secularist elite . 
the army , which has staged three coups since 1960 , declared last month that its struggle against Islamists was a matter of &quot; life or death &quot; for Turkey , a member of NATO .
