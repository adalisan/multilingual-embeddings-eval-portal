France said on Wednesday it welcomed word from Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko that his ambassador to Paris , accused of running over and killing two boys in southern France , would soon return here to stand trial . 
&quot; We are pleased by President Mobutu &apos;s decision , which will enable justice to go forward , &quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said . 
&quot; We all want justice to be done , &quot; Rummelhardt added reporters at the ministry &apos;s daily news briefing . 
Mobutu , who has been convalescing at his Roquebrune Cap-Martin retreat on the French Riviera after treatment for prostate cancer , disclosed on Tuesday that Ambassador France Ramazani Baya had been relieved of his functions . 
France has vowed to bring Baya to justice after he was accused of driving through a pedestrian crossing in the Riviera city of Menton at more than twice the legal speed limit in late November , hitting and killing Raphael Lenoir , 13 , and Ronald Lehartel , 12 . 
Baya initially agreed to submit to French justice but was then recalled to Zaire . 
he left the country after taking advantage of his diplomatic immunity . 
Mobutu , who is a close ally of France in Africa , told reporters on Tuesday that Baya would be back in France before the end of the week .
