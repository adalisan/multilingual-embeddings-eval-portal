the key September 10-year Japanese government bond futures contract was higher by midday on Wednesday due to the yen &apos;s surge against the dollar , traders said . 
&quot; Banks that had been paying fixed interest rates earlier are all on the receiving side now , &quot; the trader said . 
the Bank of Japan &apos;s money market operation this morning was more accommodative than the market expected , and was another factor leading to the rise in JGBs , the city bank trader said . 
the September stood at 123.47 by midday , up sharply from Tuesday &apos;s close of 123.14 . 
turnover was 21,626 contracts . 
traders said weak fundamentals , and speculation that the BOJ &apos;s key &quot; tankan &quot; survey of corporate sentiment due on June 25 will also come out weaker than expected , was triggering buying of JGBs and falls in interest rates . 
&quot; There is a view that the yen &apos;s recent surge against the dollar will have a negative impact on firms &apos; outlook for the economy in the tankan , &quot; the city bank trader said . 
some market players are buying JGBs based on a view that JGBs will strengthen after the release of the tankan , a trader at a city bank &apos;s securities unit said . 
&quot; Some trust banks were detected buying cash JGBs . 
the medium-term sector was particularly strong , &quot; the trader said . 
traders said medium-term JGBs , and in particular , the 133rd 10-year issue due to mature in September 2000 , had been strong since Tuesday . 
the 133rd is the cheapest-to-deliver JGB for the September five-year JGB futures contract , and there was speculation that some players may be trying to corner the market , they said . 
aggressive buying of the 175th and 176th 10-year JGBs , which have about seven to eight years left until maturity , was also detected on Tuesday , the city bank trader said . 
the 175th and 176th issues are the cheapest-to-deliver JGBs for the December 10-year JGB futures contract . 
the spread between the September and the December 10-year JGB futures contracts decreased on Tuesday , and although this may be due to the market &apos;s growing pessimism about the outlook for the economy toward the year-end , the shrinkage in spread may also have been related to the buying of the 175th and 176th JGBs , the city bank trader said . 
although weak fundamentals are likely to cause near-term firmness in JGBs , the upside may be capped by the launch of about 300 billion to 400 billion yen worth of corporate straight bonds expected this week and next , a trader at another city bank &apos;s securities unit said . 
Mitsubishi Estate Co Ltd launched a total of 30 billion yen worth of straight bonds on Wednesday . 
firms such as Anritsu Corp and Nihon cement Co Ltd are expected to follow suit later this week , and Fujitsu Ltd is expected to launch 100 billion yen worth of straight bonds next week , the trader said .
