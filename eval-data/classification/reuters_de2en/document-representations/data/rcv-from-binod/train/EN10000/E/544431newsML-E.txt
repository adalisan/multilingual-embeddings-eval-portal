a South Asian trade organisation said on Monday it would support sub-regional co-operation between member states of the seven-nation South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) . 
SAARC , launched in 1985 with India , Pakistan , Bangladesh , Sri Landka , Nepal , Maldives and Nepal as members , plans to form a regional free-trade zone by the year 2005 . 
two rounds of talks under the South Asian preferential Trade Agreement signed in 1995 have already been held with member states exchanging tariff concessions on 2,459 items . 
however , earlier in April , senior diplomats from Bangladesh , India , Nepal and Bhutan agreed on a new trade group for closer economic cooperation while SAARC remained largely ineffective because of rivalry between India and Pakistan . 
the new Growth Quadrangle group was originally planned as a SAARC sub-group but developed separately after opposition from Pakistan , which said the group will undermine SAARC . 
&quot; We as businessmen feel it is unnatural to oppose any commercial advantage that two or more than two nations can benefit from by cooperating at any level , &quot; said Rehman , who represents Bangladesh in the SCCI . 
but he said the issue would be discussed at the SAARC summit due to be held in the Maldivian capital male on May 12-14 . 
&quot; Either Pakistan will be convinced or other states will be convinced by Pakistan , &quot; Rehman said , adding : &quot; We will abide by the decision of the summit .
