there are six days to go before the British colony reverts to China . 
these are highlights of comments in the Hong Kong press . 
the views expressed are those of the newspapers quoted and do not represent an editorial viewpoint of Reuters . 
-- economic times said the decision on the salary and benefits of post-handover leader Tung Chee-hwa was reasonable , but should not be taken as a long-term arrangement for all future chief executives . 
it said because Tung was a successful businessman , he did not care much about his income , which will be HK $ 330,000 ( US $ 42,600 ) per month . 
but a salary lower than that received by top private company employees would not be fair to his successors who might not be as well off . 
-- Wen Wei PO said some foreign publications had published rumours about Tung &apos;s failure to cooperate with top civil servants , but they would not hinder a peaceful handover or the implementation of the &quot; one country , two systems &quot; policy . 
it said Hong Kong civil servants have tried their best to ensure a smooth handover and shown great patriotic feelings . 
the presence of Chinese President Jiang Zemin and British Prime Minister Tony Blair at the handover ceremony should be an opportunity for putting aside past differences and forging a new relationship .
