September saw most commodity prices , with the notable exception of oil , suffer steady erosion as a result of weak end-user demand and dwindling speculative interest as other markets like equities and bonds boomed . 
gold was the latest to suffer , dropping on Monday to its lowest London fixing for a year at $ 379 an ounce . 
gold began September at $ 387 . 
by contrast , benchmark North Sea crude oil futures are at their strongest since the 1991 Gulf War . 
they rose above $ 23.50 per barrel during Monday on renewed Middle East tension and brisk demand for heating fuel to replenish low stocks . 
Exetnding a rally , they have put on some $ 3 over September as a whole . 
industrial metals had been expected to strengthen during the month , too , after the usual northern summer holiday lull in activity . 
but traders say that end-user demand has failed to live up to expectations . 
aluminium traded on Monday on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) at its lowest for 2-1 / 4 years around $ 1,380 per tonne . 
that compared with $ 1,515 at the beginning of September . 
grain prices earlier this year had more than matched the rally in crude oil . 
in March , after drought depressed world stocks to the lowest since the 1970s , the nearby Chicago Board of Trade wheat contract &quot; spiked &quot; to a record $ 7.50 per bushel . 
predictions of bigger crops this year later took the heat out of the rally and in September these were fulfilled as news of bumper European and Chinese harvests was reported . 
CBOT wheat began September at almost $ 4.50 and was ending the month below $ 4.30 . 
coffee prices also declined and were hit by a new speculative sell-off on Monday on a view that Brazil has a good crop and producer nations do not intend new measures to curb supply . 
London robusta type coffee futures fell below $ 1,490 per tonne from $ 1,634 at the close on September 2 . 
cocoa bucked the trend in a rally ahead of the opening of the cocoa season in the Ivory Coast , the biggest exporter . 
London cocoa futures closed Monday at 987 sterling per tonne after 971 at the start of September .
