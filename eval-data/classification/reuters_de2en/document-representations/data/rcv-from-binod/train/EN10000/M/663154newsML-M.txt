Komercni Banka , the most heavily weighted banking issue on the bourse , led the PX50 index into the doldrums in exceptionally quiet trading on Monday . 
the PX50 was unchanged on 506.0 . 
Komercni fell 21 crowns to 2,009 but despite being the second most actively traded share during continuous trading chalked up just 1.2 million crowns in turnover . 
dealers said Komercni was mainly the victim of worries about the Czech economy although they conceded that the bank &apos;s position as the biggest commercial bank made it relatively more exposed to the downturn in the business cycle than other banks . 
&quot; I think that the major focus is on the economy than on the bank itself , &quot; said Lubomir Vystavel of ING Barings . 
Vystavel added that the absence of SPT Telecom and CEZ , by far the two most heaviliy capitalised Cech shares , had probably had a knock-on effect in terms of interest for Komercni and the market as a whole . 
the ownership deadline for dividend payouts to Komercni shareholders is June 25 . 
Komercni will pay a 101 crown gross dividend . 
overall , turnover plunged to 408 million crowns .
