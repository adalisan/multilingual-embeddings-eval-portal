striker Phil Masinga ended a short international retirement with a call-up to the South African squad for the World Cup qualifier against Zaire on April 27 , officials announced on Tuesday . 
Masinga , who plays for Salernitana in Italy &apos;s second division , has led his country &apos;s scoring since the return to international football five years ago . 
but he quit the international game in January after he had been subjected to repeated abuse from home fans after a series of sub-standard performances . 
the former Leeds United player has now changed his mind and has been drafted into the team by a grateful coach Clive Barker , under intense pressure after South Africa &apos;s surprise 2-0 defeat by the Congo two weeks ago . 
Masinga &apos;s lanky frame and ability to unsettle opposition defences was sorely missed in South Africa &apos;s defeat in Pointe noire , which sees the country trailing the Congo by three points in group three of the African qualifiers . 
Barker has kept faith with the 19 squad members who travelled to Congo and also added midfielder Thomas Madigage and third-choice goalkeeper Brian Baloyi , the only uncapped player . 
the match has been switched to Lome , Togo because of the civil war in Zaire . 
South African officials were first told that the game would take place in Pointe noire , Congo but FIFA later changed their decision after strong protests . 
South Africa have accused Congo of severe intimidation and harassment during their trip there and have sent a protest letter to the world governing body .
