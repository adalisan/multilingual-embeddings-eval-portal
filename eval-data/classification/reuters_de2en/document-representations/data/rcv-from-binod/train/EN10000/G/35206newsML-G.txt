a staff shakeup hit the top echelon of Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole &apos;s struggling campaign against President Bill Clinton on Thursday , just two months before the Nov . 5 election . 
two veteran media advisers to Dole , Don Sipple and Mike Murphy , have resigned in the campaign reshuffle , Dole spokesman Nelson Warfield said during a campaign stop here . 
the men had worked for Dole for months but had done little to help move him up in opinion polls which show Dole lagging by some 15 to 20 percentage points in national polls . 
Warfield said the campaign had decided to take greater control of its television advertising operation , adding that the two men had decided to leave as a result . 
&quot; A strategic decision was made to bring the ad group ... more directly into the overall campaign structure under Scott Reed , &quot; Warfield said , referring to the Dole campaign manager . 
&quot; When we made this organisational decision they decided to go a different path and that &apos;s fine , &quot; the spokesman added . 
&quot; We part as friends . 
Sipple , who crafted the biographical video of Dole broadcast at last month &apos;s Republican national convention , was brought on to the campaign in February after the Republican &apos;s defeat in the New Hampshire primary . 
Murphy , generally viewed as an expert at negative campaigning , joined the campaign in June and had been a top operative for former Tennessee Gov. 
Lamar Alexander , one of Dole &apos;s unsuccessful challengers for the Republican presidential nomination . 
the Clinton campaign jumped on the resignations with claims that Dole &apos;s problems were in his policies . 
&quot; The biggest problem with the Dole campaign is not in the packaging , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s deputy campaign manager Ann Lewis . 
&quot; It is the policies . 
staff shakeups are not going to help it . 
campaigning with Clinton in Tampa , Fla . , Clinton campaign press secretary Joe Lockhart said &quot; Clearly from watching the campaign , they are in conflict on which way to go , what message to pursue . 
I think it was inevitable that here would be another shakeup . 
Sipple and Murphy were operating a company called New Century Media , which Dole oficials said had been a free-standing operation but was now being integrated into the campaign . 
both could have stayed with the campaign if they wanted to , Dole spokeswoman Christina Martin said in Washington . 
the men will be replaced by a new advertising team , including media consultants Alex Castellanos and Greg Stevens . 
the departures dramatised the Dole campaign &apos;s woes as it tries to catch up with Clinton as the election fast approaches . 
their leaving overshadowed Dole &apos;s campaign appearances in Ohio , where he is wrapping up a four-day campaign swing through the Midwest . 
dole brought his programme of tax cuts to a private , religious school in Dayton , Ohio on Thursday morning and was scheduled to hold a rally in Akron in the afternoon before flying back to Washington .
