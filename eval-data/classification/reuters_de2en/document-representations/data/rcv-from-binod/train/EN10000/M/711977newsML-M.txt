summer demand from North Asia should continue to support Asia &apos;s heavy sweet crudes which are used for direct burning , traders said on Monday . 
premiums for Minas and Duri crudes are rising strongly , spurred by Japanese utility demand . 
but other crudes are expected to see limited upside potential during this week , although at the same time prices might have reached a floor after touching historically low levels , they said . 
Oman crude was last done at a discount to Dubai for August -- the first time Oman has traded below Dubai , traders said . 
the official monthly Oman MPM price is set at a premium to Dubai . 
spot Oman normally trades at a differential to the MPM , or at a premium to Dubai spot quotes . 
Oman buyers , such as Exxon , Caltex and refiners in China and South Korea have already bought a large volume of Brent-related priced crudes for August , cutting their requirements for August Oman . 
air conditioning demand in North Asia is pushing heavy sweet crude values higher in Asia , extending a rising trend of the last few weeks . 
an end-July parcel of Minas was done last week at ICP + 48 cents per barrel , the highest level in several weeks . 
the crude had been trading around + 25 cents . 
an August Duri crude was done into Japan at ICP + $ 1.00 , a further reflection of the firmer tone of the market . 
prices were expected to stay strong this week , traders said . 
Middle East crudes remained weak , but could at least have found a floor for now . 
this has dragged down August Oman prices from Dubai + 25 cents per barrel earlier in the month , to the latest deal done at a discount to Dubai . 
last week , Oman cut its official retroactive term price for June by $ 1.50 per barrel from May to $ 17.75 , which narrowed Oman &apos;s premium over Dubai by 23 cents per barrel to 47 cents . 
but this has done little to support the crude and traders said a bigger price reduction was needed to have any impact on the Oman market . 
but almost all the Oman cargoes for August have now been committed , which should stabilise prices , they said . 
levels of Abu Dhabi crudes were also expected to steady this week as August trading was almost finished . 
high stocks of middle distillates in Japan have led the lighter Abu Dhabi and Qatari grades to trade at deep discounts to official prices for August . 
on the Asian light crudes , movements of cargoes out of the Asian region would provide some support to the bearish market , traders said . 
one million barrels of light Malaysian Tapis crude , which were scheduled to be loaded in July , were moving into the U.S. Gulf Coast , they said . 
naturally declining production of light Papua New Guinea Kutubu crude was also likely to cut the number of cargoes available for August from four to three . 
but prices were only expected to move up marginally and not likely to strengthen drastically , as there were still more than adequate supplies to meet Asian refiners &apos; demand for the light grades . 
in June and July , refinery maintenance shutdown in Indonesia and Australia kept Asia &apos;s light sweet crude market depressed , with Cossack traded at over $ 1.00 discount under the APPI , the lowest level done for the crude this year .
