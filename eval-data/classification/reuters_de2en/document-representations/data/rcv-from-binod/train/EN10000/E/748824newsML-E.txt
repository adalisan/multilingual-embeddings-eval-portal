unemployment figures in Hungary , Poland and Slovakia suggest falling jobless rates but the Czech Republic will remain an exception , J.P. Morgan analysts said in a new report . 
&quot; Data suggest that the big jump in unemployment attending the early years of transition , up to the peaks recorded in 1994 , are these days being - gradually - unwound in Hungary , Poland and Slovakia , &quot; they said in the weekly &quot; Data Watch : Central Europe . 
J.P. Morgan analysed unemployment figures in the four states and said the contrasting economic fortunes of the countries have shown up strikingly in their unemployment rates over the past 12 months . 
&quot; The divergence between Poland and the Czech Republic is especially noteworthy , &quot; they said . 
&quot; In Poland , strong activity has steadily trimmed the jobless rate - to 11.6 percent this past June from over 14.3 percent one year earlier . 
&quot; In the Czech Republic , by contrast , slowing output growth along with declining corporate profitability has led to a persistent climb in the number of unemployed , albeit from low levels by regional standards , &quot; they said . 
Czech jobless levels stayed around three percent throughout most of the period before heading upwards in recent months . 
developments in Hungary were less pronounced , with the jobless rate falling to 10.3 percent in June from 11.3 percent a year ago , as the output recovery has been modestly improving the jobless figures since the start of 1997 , they said . 
the analysts said that not only the levels of employment and unemployment changed but there have also been significant shifts in the structure of employment . 
in industry , employment fell in all four countries from 1992 to 1996 . 
in agriculture , employment also fell in all but Poland , where employment in the sector rose to 26.8 percent in 1996 from 25.8 percent in 1992 . 
in services , employment rose to 52.3 percent from 46.6 percent in the Czech Republic , to 59.1 percent from 53.6 percent in Hungary , to 55.5 percent from 48.9 percent in Slovakia , and edged up to 42.6 percent from 41.5 percent in Poland . 
&quot; This shift to employment in the tertiary sector is a clear manifestation of how the transition economies are coming to look increasingly like their western neighbours , &quot; J.P. Morgan &apos;s analysts concluded .
