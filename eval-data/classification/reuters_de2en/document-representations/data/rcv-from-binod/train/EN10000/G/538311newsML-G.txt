the Redskins re-signed Darrell Green on Friday , ensuring that the six-time Pro bowl cornerback will play his entire National Football League career with Washington . 
terms of the new contract for the 14-year vetern , who was an unrestricted free agent , were not disclosed . 
Green , 37 , was a first-round draft pick in 1983 . 
he is the Redskins &apos; all-time leader in interceptions with 43 , including three in 1996 . 
&quot; He is simply one of the greatest players in the franchise &apos;s history and he will finish his career as a Washington Redskin , &quot; Redskins general manager Charley Casserly said . 
&quot; He is the heart and soul of the Washington Redskins . 
Green , who in his prime was considered the fastest player in the NFL , has played in 202 games , fourth on the team &apos;s all-time list . 
&quot; It &apos;s hard to put in words how I &apos;m feeling right now , &quot; Green said . 
&quot; This is the only place I wanted to be and the Redskins , in no uncrertain terms , expressed that they wanted me to finish my career as a Redskin . 
Green returns to a Washington secondary that has added free agents CRIS Dishman and Jesse Campbell this offseason .
