Madeleine Albright , on her first trip to Germany as U.S. secretary of state , will play down spats over Scientology and Iran to focus on the main issue facing the two allies -- winning Russian approval for NATO &apos;s expansion . 
Albright , on the second stop on her 11-day maiden tour as Washington &apos;s first female foreign minister , will home in on NATO in talks on Monday with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel , her spokesman said . 
even small differences of approach , such as Bonn &apos;s openness to a French idea for top-level talks with Russia , will be secondary to the main goal of preparing for NATO &apos;s Madrid conference in July , said spokesman Nicholas Burns said . 
the conference proposes to invite former Warsaw Pact states to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and Burns said : &quot; We are focussed on the road to Madrid . 
he was speaking in Bonn after Albright arrived from talks with Italian leaders in Rome , the first stop on a tour that will also take her to Paris , Brussels , London , Moscow , Seoul , Tokyo and Beijing . 
Germany , as a key European Union and NATO member with good relations with Russia , would play an important part in helping to formulate a Western position palatable to Moscow , he said . 
&quot; President ( Bill ) Clinton sees in Chancellor Kohl his major partner in terms of what the West can do to help improve our relations with Russia , &quot; Burns said . 
&quot; President Clinton really relies on Chancellor Kohl &apos;s judgement on this issue and relies on the good relationship that Chancellor Kohl has developed with ( Russian ) President ( Boris ) Yeltsin . 
Russia fiercly opposes NATO &apos;s expansion , regarding its plan to take in such states as Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic as a dangerous threat to its security . 
Albright said on Saturday she would unveil new details of NATO &apos;s proposals for European security when she met Russian leaders later in the week . 
burns said she would also discuss Bosnia and U.S.-European Union relations with German leaders during her morning talks , after which she will go on to Paris for a meeting with French President Jacques Chirac . 
one dispute grabbing the headlines in Germany -- the State Department &apos;s criticism of the government &apos;s disapproving stand on the Church of Scientology -- might not even come up . 
&quot; I don &apos;t expect Secretary Albright is going to raise that issue , &quot; Burns said , adding that Washington would continue talking with Bonn in private about the controversial group . 
Kinkel said in a newspaper interview that German courts had determined Scientology was a business rather than a church and he would repeat this to Albright if the issue arose . 
burns said Washington also disagreed with its European allies over their &quot; critical dialogue &quot; with Iran and trade with Libya , both states which the United States says sponsor terrorism . 
Albright made no headway on these issues in Rome and Burns gave no indication that he expected anything more than an exchange of known views on them in Bonn .
