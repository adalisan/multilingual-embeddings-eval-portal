the Bundesbank said on Thursday that it expected German inflation to remain below two percent for the next two years , with high unemployment seen minimising domestic risks to this forecast . 
in its January monthly report , the German central bank said this expectation formed the basis for its decision to lower the assumption for &quot; unavoidable inflation &quot; which fed into its decision on this year &apos;s money supply growth target . 
the Bundesbank traditionally uses three basic estimates -- unavoidable inflation , production potential and the slowdown in velocity of circulation of money -- as the basis for setting its annual target for its main policy indicator . 
production potential assesses the room for growth in the economy , while the velocity figure is a measure of how intensively funds are used in the economy . 
a slowdown in the velocity means , roughly speaking , that the economy has to be provided with more funds to stimulate an equivalent amount of economic growth . 
when it set its 1997 target in December , the Bundesbank deviated from its usual practice of setting unavoidable inflation at two percent , instead setting a range of 1-1 / 2 to two percent for this figure . 
in its report , the Bundesbank said this reflected the fact that inflation looked likely to stay below this level for some time to come . 
&quot; One year ago , the Bundesbank said the reduction of the mid-term price estimate would be conditional on the fact that the inflation rate could lodge itself below the two percent level long-term , &quot; the Bundesbank said . 
&quot; For a variety of reasons such a scenario seems entirely realistic for the next two years , throughout the remaining period of existence of the mark , &quot; it added . 
citing the reasons which supported this view , the Bundesbank said there appeared to be no sign of inflation in the general provision of funds to the economy . 
furthermore , globalisation of markets and the resultant high level of competition left a much smaller margin for price increases , it said . 
authorities in general had become more inflation-conscious , while domestic price tensions were likely to remain low due to the high level of unemployment , which was likely to keep a lid on wage increases . 
there were also no expectations of notable administrative price rises -- such as through indirect taxation . 
the Bundesbank said the expectations of low inflation for some time to come were reflected in the current low capital market interest rates . 
the average yield on German public paper fell to an all-time record low of 4.99 percent on Wednesday . 
data released on Wednesday showed that German inflation averaged just 1.5 percent in 1996 . 
meanwhile unemployment , now at 4.1 million , is seen remaining high in 1997 .
