the dollar closed lower in Europe , weakened by profit-taking after its brief rise above 1.72 marks last week , and covering of mark shorts , traders said . 
against the backdrop of a firmer mark the dollar slipped close to the 1.70 mark level after erosion of support at 1.7050 triggered stop-loss selling . 
&quot; We have seen somewhat of a recovery in the mark in the past few days and that is continuing gently , &quot; said Paul Crowhurst , a trader at Bank of Boston in London . 
&quot; The dollar is still consolidating because it had come a long way quite quickly but the retracement is not very large . 
at 1547 GMT the dollar was at 1.7022 / 27 marks and 121.62 / 67 yen , down from 1.7192 / 97 and 121.94 / 99 in late Europe on Friday . 
dollar / yen weakened in line with dollar / mark but a rise in the mark / yen cross supported the U.S. unit against the yen . 
the mark was at 71.40 / 44 , up from 70.93 / 96 . 
unwinding of long dollar positions after last Friday &apos;s non-farm payrolls capped the dollar &apos;s rise , traders said . 
the 10-year yield spread between U.S. and German bonds , a leading indicator of dollar / mark &apos;s direction , dropped back below 100 after expanding to over 115 last week , reflecting a change in interest rate expectations .
