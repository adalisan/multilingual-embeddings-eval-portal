the three surviving Beatles have ruled out a reunion and decided not to release any more singles . 
the decision was announced after the release of &quot; anthology III &quot; , the third album of rare archive material covering the career of the world &apos;s most famous pop group . 
to mark the first two anthologies , Paul McCartney , George Harison and Ringo Starr released two new songs remixed with the voice and backing of John Lennon , who was murdered outside his New York apartment in 1980 . 
the first two anthology albums have sold 12 million copies . 
the three surviving Beatles vetoed moves to release a soulful version of their song &quot; Helter Skelter &quot; as a single . 
former Beatles press officer Derek Taylor told reporters at the album launch on Tuesday : &quot; There is no more . 
the Beatles needed what the Americans call closure , and this is it . 
&quot; There will certainly never be a Beatles reunion on stage , that is for sure .
