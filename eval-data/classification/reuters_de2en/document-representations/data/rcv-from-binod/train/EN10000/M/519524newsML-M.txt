CSCE cocoa futures rose on Friday following an unexpectedly strong showing on the U.S. first quarter cocoa grind , traders said . 
the grind figures - which measure how much cocoa is processed by U.S. manufacturers and is considered a good barometer of consumption -- rose by a whopping 20.74 percent compared with the same year-ago period , to 95,435 tonnes . 
the figures , which came in at more than double most analysts &apos; estimates , fueld an early speculative rally , driving the nearby months up more than $ 20 a tonne at one point . 
but the market was unable to challenge key resistance overhead , and buying momentum rapidly fizzled . 
analysts said today &apos;s U.S. numbers , while initially viewed as positive , were not enough by themselves to sustain buying interest . 
&quot; It was certainly above expectations , &quot; Corey Bell , an analyst for Dean Witter in Chicago , said of the U.S. cocoa grind . 
&quot; But ( the outlook ) is still relatively negative due to lower than expected grind data from the U.K. , the Netherlands and Germany . 
&quot; It looks like a better than expected ( Ivorian ) crop , and that will likely put a cap on any rally near-term , &quot; he added . 
July cocoa rose $ 12 a tonne on the day , to close at $ 1,463 , having traded from $ 1,461 to $ 1,473 . 
spot May futures gained $ 19 , to $ 1,437 . 
technically , July &apos;s next upside objective was seen at $ 1,480 , while $ 1,433 was seen as key support level .
