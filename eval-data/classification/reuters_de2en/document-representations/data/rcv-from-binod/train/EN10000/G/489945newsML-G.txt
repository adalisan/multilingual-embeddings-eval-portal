European Union foreign ministers said on Sunday they hoped to make progress on key issues of reform before a mid-June Amsterdam summit . 
the Dutch EU presidency summoned ministers to this coastal resort in an effort to inject fresh energy into the year-old inter-governmental conference ( IGC ) , fearing it has been overshadowed by the run-up to monetary union and by attention given to trouble-spots like Albania . 
&quot; This special conclave is aimed at keeping the reform process on track , &quot; a Dutch foreign ministry spokesman said . 
&quot; We &apos;re moving towards the end of negotiations ( in Amsterdam ) , &quot; German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told reporters on his arrival . 
Ministers , who last met two weeks ago in Rome to celebrate the bloc &apos;s 40th birthday , are to focus on reviewing the Union &apos;s institutions which , many fear , could grind to a halt as the bloc expands eastwards over the next 10 years . 
in an attempt to streamline policy-making , ministers will look at ways to trim the size of the executive European Commission and extend the scope of qualified majority voting . 
Ministers will look again at plans to integrate the Western European Union ( WEU ) , the bloc &apos;s fledgling defence club , into the EU , effectively creating a collective security policy . 
but the bloc &apos;s four neutral states , plus Britain , are unlikely to embrace a Franco-German-led plan for a phased move to a common defence policy . 
we resist it , &quot; British junior foreign minister David Davis told reporters . 
Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen said she hoped there would be some progress on foreign and security policy , but anticipated work on other issues could only be stepped up once British elections were out of the way on May 1 . 
with growing worker unrest across Europe and the biggest jobless figures in Germany since Hitler &apos;s rise to power , the EU wants to win the hearts of its 18 million unemployed by enshrining the goal of job creation in a revamped treaty . 
the Dutch face a tight schedule to broker a revised Maastricht Treaty . 
if the IGC review is not completed by the June summit , accession talks with those wanting to join the bloc will be delayed and will risk becoming mired in crucial decisions on economic and monetary union ( EMU ) and French and German elections next year . 
Ministers are also likely to discuss the thorny issue of whether to stand together in condemning China &apos;s record on human rights . 
Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo last week wrote a stinging letter to his EU colleagues suggesting some were applying double standards on human rights . 
his missive was sparked by France &apos;s refusal to back a joint European resolution condemning China at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva . 
the 53-member Commission , in which developing countries have an overall majority , has rebuffed EU-U.S. efforts to censure China for the past six years . 
France , with the tacit backing of Germany , Spain and Italy , argues that dialogue with China is better than confrontation . 
van Mierlo warned that this internal breaking of ranks was a serious setback for prospects of a common EU foreign policy and damaged the bloc &apos;s credibility on the world stage . 
China has accused the West of using the Human Rights Commission to attack developing countries .
