Bangkok &apos;s criminal court on Friday ordered a warrant for the arrest of the Australian-born daughter of a Hong Kong-based businessman after she failed to appear to face drug-trafficking charges . 
Lisa Marie Smith , 20 , who carries Australian and British passports , was arrested at Bangkok airport on February 13 after she was found with four kilograms ( 8.8 pounds ) of a substance police originally thought was opium but later said was cannabis and 565 amphetamine tablets . 
Smith , the Melbourne-born daughter of Terry Smith , chief of insurance giant National Mutual Asia , was released on 1.5 million baht bail ( US $ 59,500 ) in June , becoming the first foreigner facing drug charges to be released on bail . 
her lawyer was not immediately available for comment . 
soon after her arrest , Smith told reporters she had been tricked into carrying the drugs to Tokyo by Pakistani drinking friends . 
but she said she would plead guilty . 
Smith became the second Australian to evade Thai justice this week . 
Daniel Westlake , 46 , from Victoria made the first successful jailbreak from Klongprem prison in the northern outskirts of Bangkok on Sunday night . 
he , too , was facing drug charges .
