the Federal Communications Commission proposed Monday to allow phone companies -- without FCC approval -- to expand into new geographic areas they are otherwise eligible to serve . 
under the proposal , which implements last year &apos;s telecommunications law , carriers no longer would need approval before building , buying , operating or transmitting services over an extension of any line of communication . 
under existing law , carriers must get FCC certificaiton that the extension was consistent with the public convenience and necessity . 
the new FCC plan distinguishes between &quot; extensions &quot; and &quot; new &quot; lines and tentatively concludes that &quot; new &quot; lines will continue to require FCC approval .
