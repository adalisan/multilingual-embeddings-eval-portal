the president of Brazil &apos;s federal bank Banco do Brasil has announced the creation of two new insurance companies in partnership with insurance firms Sul America Seguros and Seguros Alianca da Bahia . 
the new companies Brasilveiculos Companhia de Seguros and Companhia de Seguros Alianca do Brasil will operate in the domestic market , as well as in other countries , especially the member states of the Mercosur customs union . 
Paulo Cesar Ximenes said the two companies were expected to rank among Brazil &apos;s top five insurance firms in the next 10 years , with 1997 turnover estimated at 279 million reais ( $ 270.9 million ) for Brasilveiculos and at 420 million reais ( $ 407.8 million ) for Alianca do Brasil . 
Brasilveiculos , with capital of 72 million reais ( $ 69.9 million ) , will specialize in car insurance , while Alianca do Brasil , with capital of 140 million reais ( $ 135.9 million ) , will offer a variety of insurance products including life insurance . 
Brasilveiculos is a joint venture of Banco do Brasil &apos;s wholly-owned subsidiary BB-Banco de Investimento SA with Brazil &apos;s largest insurers Sul America Seguros . 
Alianca do Brasil is formed by Banco do Brasil &apos;s insurance arm Brasilseg Seguradora do Brasil SA and Seguros Alianca da Bahia . 
Ximenes said it was decided to create two companies given that Seguros Alianca da Bahia had no interest in offering car insurance products , which represent only a small part of its insurance portfolio . 
Banco do Brasil holds 40 percent of the ordinary shares and 100 percent of the preference shares in each of the insurance companies , while Sul America Seguros and Seguros Alianca da Bahia control 60 percent of the ordinary shares each . 
the share capital of each of the two new insurance companies has been divided equally into ordinary and preference shares . 
Brasilveiculos and Alianca do Brasil will start operating early next year .
