Asia &apos;s light crude market is expected to dig deeper into its bearish rut this week , feeling the pressure from falling gas oil prices and reduced refinery rates , traders said on Monday . 
tighter spot supplies caused by maintenance works at Australia &apos;s 80,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) Cossack and 70,000-bpd Griffin crude fields are expected to do little to raise prices , unless product prices improve enough to give refinery margins a boost , traders said . 
a seller was expected to have difficulties disposing of an early August Kutubu cargo at current price levels , because of thin interest . 
many Asian refiners are undergoing maintenance shutdowns , reducing the demand for crude . 
shell Australia was scheduled to start a two-week maintenance shutdown of the 74,000 bpd crude distillation unit ( CDU ) at its 115,000 bpd Geelong refinery over the weekend . 
Indonesia &apos;s 200,000-bpd Balikpapan refinery started a full maintenance shutdown last week , lasting a month , while Australian Petroleum ( Ampol ) was planning to shutdown a 40,000-bpd CDU at its 95,000-bpd Lytton refinery for three weeks from the middle of August . 
but even refiners not planning shutdowns prefer not to run at full capacity , discouraged by the weak product prices , traders said . 
&quot; refiners who are planning to have maintenance shutdowns would normally run at maximum capacity prior to the shutdown . 
but I don &apos;t think anyone here is running at full capacity , &quot; said a refiner in Australia . 
in Singapore , Shell expected average output from its 59,000 tonnes per day ( tpd ) Pulau Bukom refinery to be reduced by more than 10 percent in July . 
Esso Singapore is said to be running at reduced rates . 
as a result of general lacklustre demand , Tapis crude , Asia &apos;s benchmark light grade , has touched year low levels , falling to $ 19.00 per barrel , compared to more than $ 27.00 in January . 
for spot trading , August Tapis has traded at its APPI quotes + 2 cents per barrel -- the lowest in more than a year and reflective of the bearish tone . 
but with gasoil prices under $ 20.00 , traders said that outright crude prices must fall further to boost refinery margins and stimulate buying interest from Asian refiners . 
to further aggravate the weak demand , South Korean refiners are increasingly using West African crudes instead of regional grades to meet their baseload supply of low sulphur crudes . 
despite a wider Brent / Dubai spread , which limited the West African crude buying from most Asian refiners , Yukong , Ssangyong and LG Caltex in Korea have bought August loading cargoes and are still looking for more , market sources said . 
the last surge of West African crude buying into Asia was in early June , when a narrowing of the Brent / Dubai spread to 50 cents , spurred demand from China , Japan , South Korea , and Indonesia . 
on Monday , the August Brent / Dubai spread was quoted at around $ 1.15 . 
but the practicality of buying a 1.8mn barrel very large crude carrier ( VLCC ) of West African crude , compared to several 500,000 barrel cargoes of Asian grades is attractive to the refiners . 
&quot; If we bought three cargoes of Tapis or Australian crude at one time , the price of these grades will immediately go up , making it difficult to buy more , &quot; said a refiner in South Korea . 
but in the midst of the bearish crude market , heavy sweet Asian grades , used mainly for power generation in North Asia , are expected to remain firm over the next week , finding continued support from Japanese utility buying . 
heavy sweet Minas crude traded at ICP + 70 cents per barrel for August last week , the highest premiums seen this year . 
heavy Duri crude was also sold at a year high premium of ICP + 1.28 for August .
