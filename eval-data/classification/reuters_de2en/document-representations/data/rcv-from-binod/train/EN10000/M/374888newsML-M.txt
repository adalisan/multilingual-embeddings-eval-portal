NWE naphtha prices ended modestly lower on Thursday after the tightness in the prompt cargo market lightened , at least temporarily . 
&quot; It &apos;s just a bit of a correction down but it is not over by any means , &quot; said one source , referring to the feverish prompt buying that has blown naphtha prices out sharply versus crude oil and other products . 
Feb swaps ended down $ 5.50 a $ 221 / $ 222 a tonne . 
March swaps , which were seen as more dependent on the crude market , fell $ 2.50 to $ 213 / $ 214 , sources said . 
one trader who was a bidder for pipeline spec material at $ 228 CIF appeared to back away after another trader become an aggressive seller , near $ 226 CIF , sources said . 
earlier , an end-user bought a 10,000 tonne Russian Dow quality cargo at $ 219 CIF Ara , sources said .
