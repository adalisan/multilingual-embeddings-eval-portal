CSCE world sugar prices ended lower Thursday , hit by speculative and arbitrage selling as well as price fixing by producers at the highs , trading sources said . 
the market drifted in negative territory throughout the entire day , slowly working its way lower as operators took profits on the raws &apos; recent run-up . 
producers were keen sellers toward 10.65 cents a lb , while scale-down buying by processors provided support near 10.60 cents . 
arbitrage selling against the London market also figured in New York &apos;s weakness today , spurred the recent steep decline on the whites &apos; March / March premium , dealers said . 
benchmark New York March closed down 0.09 at 10.59 after trading from 10.57 to 10.68 . 
Second-position May fell 0.05 cent to 10.65 , while the outer months eased 0.04 . 
an estimated 9,014 lots changed hands on the day . 
with little physical offtake to buoy the market , traders said raws could be gearing up for a test of recent lows . 
today &apos;s high of 10.68 cents matched Wednesday &apos;s peak , creating a bearish double top on the charts , they pointed out . 
&quot; The market is starting to give the impresssion that the consolidation may be over , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; If we can &apos;t get back to Tuesday &apos;s high of 10.71 cents , it &apos;s going to work it &apos;s way back down again . 
March sugar would need to hold above the crucial 10.50-cent mark or risk facing a heavy bout of stop-loss selling , he said .
