U.S. stock index futures surged to sharp gains in brisk early pit trading , hoisted higher by a rally in U.S. debt futures after weaker than expected economic data . 
standard &amp; Poor &apos;s ( S &amp; P ) 500 futures posted a small loss in Globex trading until treasuries surged more than a full point after the first-quarter U.S. employment cost index rose 0.6 percent versus expectations for a 0.9-percent increase . 
March U.S. durable goods orders fell three percent , their biggest drop since August 1996 and versus forecasts for no change in the volatile measure . 
the market already was perched at lofty levels when the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence in April slipped to 116.8 against forecasts for 118.4 . 
&quot; technically , they look great , &quot; said a floor broker . 
&quot; The market has done okay recently . 
all we needed was a little boost ... we got that from bonds . 
the rally within the first five minutes lifted the Dow 30 Industrials more then 50 points higher and triggered the New York Stock Exchange &apos;s curb on index arbitrage program trades . 
fair value Tuesday stood at about 3.60 points premium . 
if the curb were lifted , arbitrage buy programs would be expected at 4.20 points over cash and sell programs at 2.60 points premium . 
on pullbacks , intraday support stood at about 785.20 , last Thursday &apos;s high , and again near 778.50-90 , the broker added .
