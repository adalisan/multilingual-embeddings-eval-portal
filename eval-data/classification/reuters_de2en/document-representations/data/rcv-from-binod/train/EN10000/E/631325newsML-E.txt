Q1 97 0.8 PCT 3.4 PCT 2.8 PCT 
at market prices 629.50 624.21 0.8 
final domestic demand 639.63 629.45 1.6 
a Reuters survey of economists had forecast a 1.0 percent rise in the first quarter after the 0.7 percent rise in the previous quarter . 
in the fourth quarter of 1996 , GDP rose 0.7 percent from the third quarter or an annualized rate of 2.9 percent . 
statistics Canada said the economy maintained its momentum in the quarter , with the 0.8 percent gain led by domestic demand . 
the agency said healthy gains were recorded in business investment in plant and equipment , up 4.8 percent , consumer spending , which rose 1.3 percent in real terms , and investment in housing . 
exports rebounded from their fall in the fourth quarter , rising 6.3 percent , but imports increased sharply too , up 6.7 percent . 
the quarterly rate of inflation for Canadian-made goods and services , as measured by the chain price index , was 0.5 percent , up from 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996 . 
government spending continued to decline in the quarter , as current spending on goods and services was flat and investment spending dropped . 
overall government spending , which includes interest payments and transfers , fell 0.4 percent while revenues grew 1.3 percent , StatsCan said . 
the government was in a net lending position at a surplus of C $ 496 million , in sharp contrast to the deficit of C $ 23.8 billion in the first quarter of 1996 . 
consumer spending surged in the quarter , with strong demand for all types of consumer goods and services , especially big ticket items . 
household borrowing remained high . 
personal income was unchanged in the quarter , StatsCan said . 
higher Labor income , up 0.7 percent , and unincorporated business income , up 0.9 percent , were offset by further declines in investment income and transfers from government as well as higher income tax collections . 
the agency said the ratio of personal saving to disposable income is now around two percent , a ratio comparable with that of the early 1960s when interest and inflation rates were similarly low .
