U.S. treasuries erased early gains and slipped lower by midday on Thursday as players took some profits before Friday &apos;s release of the influential monthly U.S. employment report . 
the 6-3 / 4 percent 30-year Treasury bond , up more than a quarter of a point in early trade , was down 5 / 32 to 98-22 / 32 , yielding 6.85 percent at midday . 
the two-year Treasury note was down 1 / 32 to 100 even , its yield finding support at six percent . 
&quot; There &apos;s just some profit-taking , some position-squaring ahead of tomorrow &apos;s employment report , &quot; said Kevin Flanagan , first vice president and money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc . &quot; We &apos;ve had a nice run-up over the last couple of trading sessions and even though sentiment is still buoyant ... the market was very overbought . 
&quot; Increasingly it looked like the market was going into the payroll number having discounted a 170,000-ish figure , &quot; said Josh stiles , senior bond strategist at I.D.E.A. 
&quot; With prices at the high end of their ranges , there was some concern that it would take an even weaker number ( than 170,000 ) to move the market higher , &quot; stiles said . 
&quot; Therefore , people are taking some money off the table in advance . 
technical factors also played into the market &apos;s late morning about-face . 
two-year notes and 30-year bonds , for example , finished above key resistance levels on Thursday . 
the 30-year bond yield ended below 6.85 percent and the two-year note yield closed beneath six percent . 
in addition , the December T-bond contract came within one tick of its 200-day moving average of 110-27 . 
&quot; The high tick today was 110-26 and we haven &apos;t been able to trade above that level , &quot; said stiles . 
&quot; It &apos;s a logical resistance point . 
new economic data was neutral to constructive for the market . 
new jobless claims stayed steady at 340,000 in the latest week , meeting economists &apos; expectations . 
and August factory orders fell 1.9 percent , steeper than the 1.2 percent drop economists had forecast . 
nonetheless , the market began trimming its gains after the factory orders report . 
stiles said there was concern that following the payrolls number on Friday , &quot; there may be too many longs in the market to be able to go higher if job growth is in the 170,000 to 175,000 area , that it would take something substantially weaker to really bring in new money . 
in early afternoon trade , three-month , six-month and year-bill rates were each up two basis points to 4.92 percent , 5.11 percent , and 5.31 percent , respectively . 
five-year notes were down 3 / 32 to 100-2 / 32 , yielding 6.36 percent . 
ten-year notes were down 2 / 32 to 102-25 / 32 , yielding 6.61 percent .
