concerned about the increasing globalization of the securities market and the loss of Israeli companies to U.S. and other foreign stock exchanges , Tel Aviv Stock Exchange officials Wednesday outlined measures aimed at fighting back . 
&quot; The most depressing figure of 1996 is ... that not one of the 80 Israeli companies that listed in New York in recent years asked to be registered also on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange ( TASE ) , &quot; its managing director , Saul Bronfeld , told a news conference . 
&quot; If the New York market is interesting in attracting foreign companies to list there , it must be in our interest that Israeli companies that floated first overseas also register for trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange ( TASE ) , &quot; TASE Chairman Yair Orgler said . 
Bronfeld warned , however , that dual listing presented regulatory problems . 
in the meantime , one of the key ways of luring Israeli companies traded overseas as well as increasing foreign investment Orgler said , would be the introduction of continuous trading . 
continuous trading , which is scheduled to begin in early March , would serve to increase liquidity , Orgler said . 
he said the TASE was also hoping to introduce remote trading from overseas , although he added that there were problems getting regulatory approval . 
other measures include further development of the Maof futures market . 
the TASE is also seeking to harmonise its regulations with overseas practices , Orgler said . 
in 1996 , the exchange reduced the time major shareholders in newly floated companies had to hold on to their shares to 18 months from 28 and eased registration of holding companies . 
Orgler said the exchange was still seeking to ease requirements for new listings and was hoping to ease membership requirements for foreigners . 
in addition , the TASE begins trading Thursday in &quot; whole &quot; shares , which is common practice in most exchanges around the world , rather than as a percentage of shares &apos; par value , Orgler said . 
Orgler warned that globalization , especially the phenomenon of dual stock exchange listings , remote access to exchanges and the development of new Nasdaq-like markets , presented a competitive threat to the TASE .
