Prime minister &apos;s questions , the noisy twice-weekly knockabout that to television viewers around the world is the essence of Britain &apos;s parliament , will never be the same again . 
new Prime Minister Tony Blair &apos;s Labour government said on Friday it intended to replace the 15-minute sessions held every Tuesday and Thursday with a single 30-minute question period on Wednesday . 
officials said Blair , elected by a landslide a week ago , had become even more convinced during the election campaign that voters were fed up with what had degenerated into an unedifying slanging match between the leaders of the two main parties . 
&quot; He believes this will produce far more effective scrutiny of the prime minister , &quot; one government official said . 
but Conservatives , now in opposition after 18 years in power , reacted angrily at what they saw as an attempt by Blair to give himself an easier ride . 
former prime minister John Major , who had toyed himself with reforming the question-and-answer session , said that it was sensible to consider improvements but that Blair should have consulted first with parliament . 
&quot; It is true that PMQs is a burden to any prime minister . 
but that is the point of it . 
it makes the prime minister directly accountable to parliament . 
the size of the government &apos;s majority in the House at present makes that accountability more important and not less , &quot; Major said in a statement . 
Blair , who has set a cracking pace since taking office , informed Major and Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown of the changes but did not consult them , officials said . 
Prime ministers down the ages have quailed before the gladiatorial confrontations , which , often dramatic and sometimes farcical , provide some of the best theatre in London . 
but Blair &apos;s lieutenants denied that the prime minister , who has already been criticised for a vaguely presidential style of leadership , wanted to turn question time into a safe podium for himself . 
&quot; I think it is a very bold and a very brave move by Tony Blair ... 
I think it will result in the legislature having a more serious possibility of cross-questioning the prime minister in a way we have never seen before , &quot; Trade Secretary Margaret Beckett told ITN television .
