President Mobutu Sese Seko might have resigned in favour of an all-party transitional authority on Thursday if Zairean peace talks scheduled for Wednesday had gone ahead , South African state radio said . 
the radio said it had obtained a copy of President Nelson Mandela &apos;s two-page proposal for an agreement which said Mobutu would step down within 24 hours of signing it . 
the meeting at which Mandela was to offer his proposal to Mobutu and rebel leader Laurent Kabila were cancelled after Kabila , citing security concerns , refused to join the other two aboard a South African ship in Congo . 
State radio said the document proposed a 10-point agreement calling for Zaire to be run by a transitional authority comprising representatives of all parties in proportions agreed to by Mobutu and Kabila until elections are held . 
the proposal said immediate measures would be taken to end the seven-month-old civil war before work was to start to set up the transitional authority , according to state radio . 
&quot; Another point states that Mobutu will vacate his post within 24 hours of signing the document . 
&quot; He will play no future role in government structures , but his safety and that of his family will be guaranteed . 
he will also be given the courtesy and dignity usually afforded to a former head of state , &quot; the radio said . 
Mandela &apos;s spokesman , Parks Mankahlana , told Reuters earlier that Mandela had drafted a two-page proposal for submission to the Wednesday meeting that never happened . 
he said Kabila was expected in Cape Town on Thursday for further discussions with Mandela , who remained hopeful of a negotiated peace based on his proposal . 
government and diplomatic sources said the division of power within the transitional authority between followers of Mobutu and of Kabila was a current sticking point . 
an initial proposal for a 60-40 split in Kabila &apos;s favour had been scrapped , partly as a result of French government objections , they said . 
&quot; If he ( Kabila ) had gone to the ship , a process of transition would have started this morning . 
this process ( the Mandela document ) would be a lot shorter than the military option , &quot; a government source said .
