trading volume at Japan &apos;s nine commodity futures exchanges totalled 7,109,107 lots in May , up 23.6 percent from the same month a year ago and 15.9 percent higher compared to April , an industry group said on Tuesday . 
turnover in May was hauled up by a sharp rise in trade of precious metal and soybean futures , the figures by the Japan Federation of commodity Exchanges showed . 
trade in rubber futures continued to decline . 
&quot; volatile prices of platinum group metals ( PGM ) caused by the expected resumption of Russian PGM exports to Japan , combined with the erratic currency market , fuelled animated speculative interest in precious metals , &quot; an analyst at a commodity broker said . 
&quot; soybean futures were also supported by the volatile Chicago market , while trade in rubber futures thinned due to a lack of fresh incentives , &quot; the analyst said .
