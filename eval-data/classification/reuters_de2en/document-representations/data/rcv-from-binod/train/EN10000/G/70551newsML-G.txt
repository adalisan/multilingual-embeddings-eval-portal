Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole warmed up on Monday for the upcoming presidential debates by attacking President Bill Clinton as a liberal who trusts only the government . 
for the second day running , Dole attacked his front-running rival as someone who would propose massive new programmes such as national health care and changes in the Republican-crafted welfare reform law if he is re-elected . 
&quot; President Clinton came to town a liberal , &quot; Dole told a rally in Springfield , a Washington suburb . 
&quot; He &apos;s still a liberal . 
the only thing that stopped him in his tracks was ( the people ) electing a Republican Congress in 1994 . 
at the rally for him and local and state Republicans including Sen. John Warner , Dole plugged for Republican candidates . 
Party members are worried that a poor Dole showing against Clinton could bring down fellow Republicans in Congress in the Nov . 5 election . 
dole , who lags in double digits behind Clinton in most polls , brushed aside his underdog status with a quip . 
he got an enthusiastic response from several hundred party members , housewives and workers at the rally in an Interstate Van Lines warehouse . 
he delivered his economic stump speech for tax cuts and less regulation . 
then , wearing a hidden microphone and answering questions like a talk show host , Dole answered questions in what he characterised as a &quot; kind of a warmup to the debates . 
he did not mention Reform Party candidate Ross Perot , who attacked him on Sunday for seeking to keep Perot out of the debates with Clinton and who filed a lawsuit on Monday to keep the debates from occurring without him . 
dole and Clinton are scheduled to debate Oct . 6 in Hartford , Connecticut , with a single moderator asking questions and again on Oct . 16 in San Diego , where the format will be a town meeting with questions from the audience . 
the questions asked of Dole on Monday came from Republican supporters in the audience , mostly small business people who argued against regulations and government mandates . 
he moved around facing the questioners as he would at a town meeting-type debate . 
to one questioner who wanted to know the difference between Clinton and Dole , the Republican responded that it came down to one word : &quot; trust . 
&quot; I trust the people ; Bill Clinton trusts the government , &quot; Dole said . 
nationally , Clinton leads Dole by double-digit margins in most polls . 
the latest CNN / USA Today / Gallup tracking poll showed Clinton 19 percentage points ahead of Dole , 53 percent to 34 percent , with Perot trailing at 6 percent . 
in this Southern state , however , the presidential race is neck-and-neck with Dole ahead by a whisker , 44 to 43 percent , according to a Mason-Dixon poll last week . 
the margin of error in that poll was 3.5 percent . 
in Virginia four years ago , then-President George Bush defeated Clinton .
