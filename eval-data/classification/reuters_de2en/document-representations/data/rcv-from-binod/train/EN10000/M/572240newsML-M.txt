Singapore gasoline prices held steady with most traders holding out for better prices while naphtha inched higher on crude support , traders said on Friday . 
a seller was heard to be offering a 15,000 tonne cargo of 90-octane supplies for May loading at $ 206- $ 209 per tonne c + f China . 
but bids from China were too low , at $ 200- $ 205 per tonne , majors said . 
&quot; There are no buyers , we have surplus supplies , &quot; said one trader . 
traders accessed the naphtha / mogas spread at $ 4.00 per barrel . 
Naphtha players were mostly distracted by Saudi Aramco term naphtha negotiations scheduled to start Monday . 
discussions would last until Thursday with 13 companies taking turns to meet with Saudi officials . 
Saudi Aramco is expected to offer 2.9 million tonnes of light naphtha from Ras Tanura and 1.3 million tonnes of full range naphtha - 800,00 tonnes from Jubail and 500,000 tonnes from Rabigh . 
the term cargoes are for lifting between July and December . 
Saudi Aramco has set a target premium of $ 17.00 per tonne while Japanese buyers are mostly holding out at $ 14- $ 15 per tonne premium . 
in the spot cash market , prices were bouyed by crude gains but support was seen as artificial as ample supplies continue to plague the market , traders said . 
Singapore &apos;s June naphtha rose marginally to $ 21.00 / $ 21.20 up from Thursday &apos;s $ 20.75 / $ 20.85 per barrel .
