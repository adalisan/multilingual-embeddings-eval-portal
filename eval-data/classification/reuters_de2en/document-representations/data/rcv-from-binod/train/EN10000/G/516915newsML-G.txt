seven Bosnian Moslems accused of murder went on trial in a Serb court on Thursday amid international protests that the case was a &quot; travesty of justice . 
the seven men , accused of murder and possession of illegal weapons , have been denied the right to choose their own defence lawyers despite appeals from human rights agencies and Western diplomats . 
&quot; Our judgment is that this whole process ... presents a fundamental denial of the defendants &apos; right to a fair trial , to have proper counsel , &quot; Michael Steiner , deputy to the international High Representative to Bosnia , told reporters . 
the justice ministry in Bosnia &apos;s Serb republic initially agreed to allow the defendants to be represented by lawyers from the Moslem-Croat federation , Steiner said . 
but the ministry later reneged on its promise and told the court in the eastern town of Zvornik that lawyers from the federation could only act as &quot; assistants . 
at Thursday &apos;s proceedings , lawyers from the federation asked the judge to adjourn the case until the issue was resolved . 
but the judge rejected the request and the federation lawyers walked out , a Reuters journalist reported . 
human rights agencies and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) have issued protests to Bosnian Serb authorities over the case . 
denying defendants the right to choose their lawyers was a clear violation of the European Convention on Human Rights , which applies to Bosnia &apos;s post-war constitution , Steiner said . 
the office of the High Representative would insist on reversing the decision , he said . 
&quot; Otherwise as I said , this trial can only be seen as a travesty of justice . 
the seven men surrendered last year to NATO troops in Serb-controlled territory near the former Moslem enclave of Srebrenica . 
NATO handed the men over to Serb authorities who later said the men confessed to murdering four Serb woodcutters in the surrounding hills . 
U.N. police monitors said the confessions were obtained under duress and that the men had been beaten badly . 
the Bosnian Serbs alleged the men were &quot; terrorists &quot; . 
but Bosnian federation authorities allege the men had been hiding in the hills since Srebrenica fell last July . 
up to 8,000 Moslem men are believed to have been executed or ambushed as they fled the enclave after the Bosnian Serb army overran the U.N.-designated &quot; safe area &quot; . 
a 1995 peace treaty split Bosnia into two autonomous territories , a Serb republic and a Moslem-Croat federation , which are supposed to be governed by an inter-ethnic central government .
