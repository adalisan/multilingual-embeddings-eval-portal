short-term interbank rates eased slightly in line with the sharp drop in the overnight rate on Wednesday , dealers said on Thursday . 
they said one-week interbank rate eased to 7.20 / 30 percent from 7.50 / 60 on Wednesday , while two-week and three-week fell to 7.30 / 40 against 7.40 / 50 . 
one-month money was steady at 7.30 / 35 percent , while two-month to six-months were unchanged at 7.35 / 40 percent . 
dealers said some unexpected inflows to some large local banks on Wednesday had triggered the fall in the overnight rate and the trend carried over to other interbank rates . 
&quot; The central bank seems to have returned some funds it had borrowed directly , &quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank . 
dealers explained that the funds returned by Bank Negara , could be funds it borrowed directly from select banks as part of its open market operations . 
no confirmation was available from Bank Negara , which does not comment on its money market operations . 
&quot; It seems like a temporary mismatch . 
and the amount does not seem very large , it was just the timing , &quot; one dealer said . 
he said the market would remain tight for the next one month until the festival season ends in the middle of February . 
the dealers said banks were hoarding cash in their vaults to allow depositors to withdraw for the twin celebrations of EID al-Fitr and Chinese Lunar New Year festivals in mid-February .
