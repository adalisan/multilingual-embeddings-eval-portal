shares hit new highs with domestic buying being the main motor . 
traders said that the 1.72 percent gain in the PSI20 index to a record close at 7,900.39 reflected the absence of sellers in a market with money to invest . 
* futures moved in line with the cash market , with the July contract ending 129 higher at 7,865 . 
* Traders felt that the buying momentum should be maintained on Tuesday even if some players feared that the market had risen too much too quickly . 
&quot; It is difficult to say what will happen tomorrow . 
anything could happen but there is no doubt the market closed with buyers predominant , &quot; said one trader . 
* The market had begun strongly , moving against the generally indifferent international trend , and had later been given an additional boost by Wall Street which brought some non-residents looking for shares as other European bourses also improved . 
* The banks were again to the fore -- helped traders said by an update on the sector by Salomon Brothers -- but cement group Cimpor and Inparsa also performed strongly .
