a small bomb exploded in front of a paramilitary police station in the southern Corsican town of Sainte-Marie Sicche early on Monday , smashing a doorway and breaking windows but causing no injuries , police said . 
no one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast , but it appeared to be part of a continuing low-level campaign by separatist guerrillas seeking greater autonomy from mainland France for their Mediterranean island home . 
despite a government vow to crack down on the militant nationalists , bombs have exploded on the holiday island virtually every night since the outlawed Corsican National Liberation Front ( FLNC ) historic wing called off a shaky truce in mid-August .
