Turkish shares jumped eight percent in heavy trading on Thursday , reclaiming much of the territory lost earlier this week on hopes that a row between the military and the Islamist-led government had been put to rest . 
the IMKB National-100 index rose 8.02 percent , or 110 points , to end the day at 1,482 , off a high of 1,502 . 
the main Istanbul index plummeted 14.9 percent in the previous three days . 
trading volume surged to 38.96 trillion lira ( $ 313 million ) from Wednesday &apos;s 15.20 trillion in a return of market confidence precipitated by a conciliatory gesture from Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan to the armed forces , dealers said . 
they said he calmed a six-day dispute with the National Security Council ( NSC ) by signing its weekend statement aimed at quelling a rise in Islamist activism since Erbakan &apos;s coalition with pro-Western conservative leader Tansu Ciller came to power . 
&quot; All markets reacted positively to Erbakan &apos;s signing of the NSC document . 
share prices had become very low , so the news prompted heavy buying , particulary in companies with good 1996 profits , &quot; Vakifbank &apos;s Gursel Yildiz said . 
dealers said some profit-taking in the afternoon slightly eroded sharp gains early in the morning session and one broker said the 1,500 index level would provide strong resistance in the near term . 
the bond market was also buoyed by the news and bond yields fell seven to eight percentage points to 100-102 percent , erasing part of a 15 percentage point rise since Monday morning . 
the lira weakened further on underlying dollar strength to 124,320 from a close of 124,070 on Wednesday . 
domestic investors were dominating the shares market , which tumbled earlier in the week on fears the military warning would jeopardise both the future of the government and its bold plans for the economy , dealers said . 
&quot; The movement has been driven mainly by the domestic market , which realised it was oversold as there were not many changes in the economic situation , &quot; said Can Akcay , chief trader for institutional sales at leading Istanbul brokerage Global Securities . 
newly found market faith in the government &apos;s ability to accelerate a sluggish privatisation programme and bring some stability to public finances had this year added 65 percent to the lira value of Istanbul shares by Friday &apos;s close . 
the eight-month old government &apos;s aim of balancing the 1997 budget includes a target of $ 5 billion in sell-off revenues . 
however , higher-than-expected February inflation of just under 80 percent announced this week disappointed some hopes about the speed of progress in strengthening the economy , dealers said . 
the risk of a further slide in shares on renewed political uncertainty hung over the market despite expectations that the military-Islamist row was defused . 
&quot; We have to wait and see what happens . 
an hour is a long time in Turkish politics , &quot; Global &apos;s Akcay said . 
newspapers said on Thursday the government planned to ask parliament to debate the security council statement . 
Haldun Sertel of Can Securities said the buying spree might be only a short-term reaction to the earlier sell-off and said there was a risk of selling by foreign investors on concern about the situation in Turkey . 
&quot; The foreigners could move to sell at any moment . 
the European Union &apos;s negative thoughts about Turkey are going to exert an influence over the market in the time to come , &quot; Sertel said . 
leading European Union politicians spoke out this week against Turkey &apos;s membership of the European grouping .
