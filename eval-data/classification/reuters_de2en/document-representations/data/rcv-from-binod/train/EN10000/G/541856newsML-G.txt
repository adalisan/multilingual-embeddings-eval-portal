arc de Triomphe winner Helissio 
made a great start to his campaign as a four-year-old with a 
spectacular six lengths win in the Group One Prix Ganay at 
Longchamp on Sunday . 
Europe &apos;s champion racehorse of 1996 , ridden by Olivier 
Peslier , left Le Destin , the mount of Thierry Gillet , trailing . 
arc runner-up Pilsudski , with Michael Kinane aboard , was a 
further 1-1 / 2 lengths back in third place in the eight-runner 
field . 
Helissio , oozing class , tracked Pilsudski &apos;s pacemaker Trojan 
sea before taking up the running about 600 metres from home . 
from then on Helissio simply toyed with his rivals , with 
Peslier barely having to move a muscle for an effortless win in 
the 10-1 / 2 furlongs ( 2.1 km ) race . 
Helissio &apos;s next objective will be the Group One coronation 
Cup at Epsom in June , with the long range target being a repeat 
of his Arc win in the autumn . 
winning trainer , Elie Lellouche , said : &quot; Helissio has 
wintered well and I beleive that he is a better horse than last 
year . 
Kinane said : &quot; Our horse looked well in the run up to the 
race , but this is the second time he has demolished us . 
of the other British runners , Strategic Choice finished 
fifth , and Last Second seventh .
