new York City on Wednesday said that it plans to sell approximately $ 625 million of new money general obligation bonds during the week of December 16 , a maneuver that will give it additional room under the ceiling that restricts how much debt it can sell . 
the negotiated deal , which will be senior-managed by Lehman Brothers , means the city will not run out of borrowing authority until late in the 1997 fiscal year , said a city official , who declined to be named . 
new York City &apos;s fiscal year ends on June 30 , and earlier this week , city officials had estimated that it would hit the debt ceiling in a couple of months . 
the Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York , which was set up in the 1980s to rescue New York City from a financial crisis , for technical reasons could not cancel $ 625 million of the city bonds that it holds , but instead needed to exchange them for cash , the city official said . 
&quot; The net effect is to cancel the old bonds , &quot; he explained . 
new York City plans to ask the state legislature to approve its plans to set up a new infrastructure authority to issue debt for education and transportation projects as way of sidestepping the debt ceiling .
