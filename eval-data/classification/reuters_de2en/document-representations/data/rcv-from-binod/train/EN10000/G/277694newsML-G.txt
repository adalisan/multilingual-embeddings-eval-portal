Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic said on Friday an OSCE delegation had delivered a &quot; balanced &quot; report on disputed local elections but had confused some facts when it visited Belgrade last weekend . 
he was speaking after the report by a delegation from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe backed opposition claims that the authorities cheated it out of victories in the November 17 polls . 
neither Milutinovic nor the state media mentioned the recommendation of former Spanish prime minister Felipe Gonzales , who headed the mission , that the election results should be restored . 
Milutinovic told the official Tanjug news agency the most important feature of the report was that it called for dialogue &quot; within the framework of the system &quot; and &quot; discussion between the authorities and the opposition in parliament . 
the opposition Zajedno coalition has boycotted parliament over the dispute and has refused to negotiate until its election victories , annulled by the courts , are confirmed . 
&quot; I think it was a fairly good , constructive and balanced report , &quot; Milutinovic said . 
&quot; We accept the suggestions as well- intentioned and constructive because they urged that everything should be considered within the institutions of our system . 
Gonzalez earlier urged Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to install &quot; real democracy &quot; and respect the opposition victories . 
Milosevic invited the mission to Belgrade after the allegations of electoral fraud sparked weeks of opposition street protests in the Serbian capital . 
Gonzalez said in the report he concluded that the anti-Milosevic Zajedno coalition fairly won the local polls in 13 key disputed provincial centres as well as in Belgrade &apos;s municipalities . 
he told a Geneva news conference that the reasons given by Serbian courts for annulling the opposition victories were based on arguments &quot; that no democratic country could have accepted . 
in a clear bid to establish its neutral credentials , the report said there was no question that Milosevic &apos;s own alliance won an overall majority of votes in the elections and triumphed in all but the contested areas . 
Tanjug , seizing on this , quoting Gonzales as &quot; confirming the elections were held in the most regular manner allowing the voice of the majority of people to be heard . 
Milutinovic said the OSCE mission had confused several facts , including the number of disputed districts , but the mix-up was understandable &quot; because naturaly the delegation could not go through everything in 24 hours . 
&quot; But what is important is the joint list of the Socialist Party , JUL ( Yugoslav Left ) and New Democracy won the majority of votes in all other municipalities , &quot; he said . 
he said the authorities would pass the report to Serbia &apos;s electoral institutions for review , a move which political analysts said could bury it for weeks .
