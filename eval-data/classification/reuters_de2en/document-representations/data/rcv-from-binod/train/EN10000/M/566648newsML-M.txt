U.S. cash crude prices popped higher Wednesday morning on supportive inventory data released Tuesday night by the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) . 
API numbers showed a surprising draw for gasoline stocks , a measure that was severely doubted by some market players . 
&quot; You &apos;ll see the numbers fade . 
there is no way the basic addition adds up for such a draw , and for implied demand for gasoline over 8 million barrels , &quot; said a Texas cash trader . 
API data actually showed implied demand of 8.7 million barrels per day for the week ended May 2 . 
early buying brought June West Texas Intermediate / Cushing 15-20 cents higher to $ 19.80-90 a barrel . 
trades were seen for Light Louisiana sweet / St. 
James at 6 cts and 8 cts over the WTI / Cushing , around 6-8 cts firmer than late Tuesday talk . 
sweet grades continued to firm on the lack of North Sea supply charted for U.S. Gulf Coast delivery in the near-term . 
traders noted that a U.S. refiner was offering Nigerian brass River into the U.S. Gulf for June 5 dates at June WTI plus 5 cts , on a delivered basis . 
Midland / WTI talked at a 32-28 cts discount to the marker , while Heavy Louisiana sweet / Empire sold 35 cts cheaper than benchmark . 
West Texas sour / Midland sold at a slightly stronger $ 1.55 discount to the marker , moving in a shade from Tuesday &apos;s levels at minus $ 1.60 . 
Eugene Island was also sold this morning , done at WTI / Cushing - $ 1.40 , again around 5 cts firmer than Tuesday .
