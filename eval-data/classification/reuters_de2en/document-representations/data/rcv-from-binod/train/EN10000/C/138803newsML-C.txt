Ciba and Sandoz , which are merging to become pharmaceuticals giant Novartis , both reported nine-month results on Tuesday . 
completion of the merger is pending U.S. Federal Trade Commission approval . 
&quot; We continue to emphatically recommend the Novartis shares as a buy , &quot; UBS analysts Birgit Kulhoff and Michael Hoehn wrote in a study released Wednesday . 
UBS also noted that both concerns expected a higher net profit for 1996 aside from the restructuring costs associated with the merger . 
&quot; While Sandoz turnover numbers were completely in line with our expectations , Ciba sales , especially in the pharmaceuticals sector , seemed at first glance to be below our forecasts , &quot; the analysts wrote . 
but although Ciba &apos;s numbers in the pharmaceuticals division showed a drop of three percent in the third quarter alone , which was &quot; massively &quot; below UBS expectations , the decline might partly reflect a shift taking place , in which sales seen in years past in the third quarter were likely to be delayed , UBS wrote . 
one factor weighing on Ciba &apos;s sales was generic substitution for its Voltaren and Lopreso products . 
UBS also blamed the drop in Ciba &apos;s U.S. sales on a change in the concern &apos;s pricing strategy . 
in the past , Ciba had announced price increases in advance , leading customers to stock up on its products before higher prices took effect . 
this typically boosted sales in the third quarter . 
but this year Ciba raised prices without announcing the move first . 
as a result , third quarter 1996 saw no strong buying by customers in advance of any price increase . 
the negative impact on its sales is expected to last through the fourth quarter . 
&quot; But in the first quarter 1997 this change should be quite positive , as the reductions in ( customers &apos; ) stocks seen in years past ( in the first quarter ) should not take place , &quot; UBS wrote . 
Ciba reported on Tuesday that group sales for the first nine months totaled 16.262 billion Swiss francs , up 2.0 percent . 
Sandoz group sales in the first nine months rose eight percent , excluding divestitures , to 11.275 billion francs .
