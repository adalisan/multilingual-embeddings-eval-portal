the Mexican peso reversed earlier strength to closed mixed on Wednesday on fears the U.S. Congress would vote to decertify Mexico as a drugs war ally , tarders said . 
&quot; Rumors ( the U.S. Congress ) will revoke certification for Mexico triggered jitters ... that caught local dealeres short on dollars , &quot; a trader said . 
the benchmark 48-hour peso closed 0.1 of a centavo firmer 7.9670 / 7.9700 per dollar , while its 24-hour stablemate ended 0.1 of a centavo weaker at 7.9630 / 7.9660 per dollar . 
same-day peso contracts earlier closed 1.7 centavos firmer at 7.9490 / 7.9540 per dollar . 
the 48-hour peso opened 150 centavos firmer at 7.9525 / 7.9560 per dollar , in response to sharp falls in primary rates the night before . 
benchmark contracts weakened to 7.9696 / 7.9730 per dollar at one stage before recovering to close virtually flat following news that President Bill Clinton said he was prepared to veto some provisions if a decertification bill were to be passed . 
&quot; The market will continue to suffer bumps and starts as long as this certification process continues , &quot; another trader said . 
&quot; At least ( the peso ) did not slip to eight per dollar again . 
traders said the peso had also zigzagged in the wake of fluctuating U.S. long bond yields . 
yields on the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond stood at 6.87 percent when the foreign exchange markets closed in Mexico , up from 6.85 percent in late trade on Tuesday . 
dealers said they awaited the effect on the U.S. bond market of U.S. retail sales data on Friday . 
&quot; These figures are important as we expect them to hit the ( U.S. ) long bond , which would make the peso slide , &quot; a dealer said .
