five people died when a mob burned nine churches , four Christian schools and a Convent in the Indonesian town of Situbondo , officials on Friday . 
State Secretary Murdiono later confirmed 2,000-3,000 people had rioted in the incident and said security had been restored in the East Java town after Thursday &apos;s disturbance . 
the incident briefly rattled foreign exchange markets in late trading on Friday after it was made public . 
&quot; It was reported that five people died . 
the security officials have recovered the situation and it is under control , &quot; Murdiono said , adding 120 people had been arrested . 
&quot; Those involved have been arrested and will be treated according to the law . 
the government regrets what happened and we hope it will not happen again , &quot; he said . 
a policeman told Reuters by telephone from Situbondo on Java island 800 km ( 500 miles ) east of the capital Jakarta that nine churches had been burnt . 
&quot; The five died inside a church , &quot; he said before the phone was cut off . 
Murdiono told reporters in Jakarta that five people had died on Thursday in Situbondo when a violent crowd attacked a number of shops and religious buildings . 
the police said the crowd also destroyed a court building and cars and caused other damage during the violence around 1 p.m. on Thursday . 
Indonesia &apos;s nearly 200 million population on the archipelago of 17,500 islands is more than 85 percent Moslem , but the state ideology preaches religious tolerance and recognises the five main religions . 
Situbondo is about 160 km ( 100 miles ) east of Indonesia &apos;s second city , Surabaya , where a number of attacks on churches were reported in June . 
the reason for these attacks was not clear . 
the policeman said it was not yet known what had caused the Situbondo riot or whether it had been organised . 
a number of people had been detained and investigations were continuing , he added . 
a Surabaya-based journalist who went to Situbondo said the riot apparently broke out after a hearing in the court into a case of alleged blasphemy against Islam . 
Murdiono confirmed the incident started at the trial of a Moslem he named as Mohammad Saleh but gave no further details . 
the journalist said several thousand people outside the court during the third hearing into the case called for the accused to be sentenced immediately or handed over to the crowd . 
he said another church was burnt in the neighbouring town of Panarukan . 
a hall being used by Roman Catholics as a church in a village in east Jakarta was burned down in mid-September . 
Catholics in the area attributed the attack to religious antagonism towards their presence . 
a spokeswoman for the Religious Affairs department said they were waiting for a report on the incident from their regional office before commenting . 
money market dealers said Indonesia &apos;s rupiah was rattled briefly against the dollar in slow late trading on Friday on news of the casualties in the religious disturbance . 
dealers said the reaction was short-lived and the market had stabilised for now , but swap premiums had risen .
