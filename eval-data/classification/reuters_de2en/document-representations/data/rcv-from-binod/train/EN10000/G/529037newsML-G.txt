Defense Secretary William Cohen said on Monday there was no concrete evidence linking Iran or any other country to the fatal truck bombing of a U.S. military housing complex in Saudi Arabia last year . 
&quot; The evidence concerning the Khobar Towers bombing thus far is fragmentary , incomplete and very circumstantial , &quot; Cohen told reporters . 
&quot; We do not have any concrete evidence of any country being directly linked to the bombing . 
Cohen &apos;s comment was the most definitive in a series of statements by Clinton administration officials that Iran has not been positively linked to the bombing last June 25 that killed 19 U.S. servicemen . 
State Department officials told the Senate last week the United States will respond appropriately against any country found to be involved in the bombing but they would not say what the response might be . 
the Washington Post quoted U.S. and Saudi officials this month as saying a senior Iranian intelligence officer , Brig. 
Gen. Ahmad Sherifi , met two years before the bombing with Hani Abd Rahim Sayegh , a Saudi Shiite arrested in Canada last month and accused of participating in the bombing . 
it quoted the officials as saying the evidence appeared to show a conclusive Iran link although a U.S. official said it would not be conclusive enough for a criminal prosecution . 
more evidence is to be gathered and it would be premature and speculative to try and lay the responsibility at the feet of any country or any particular group .
