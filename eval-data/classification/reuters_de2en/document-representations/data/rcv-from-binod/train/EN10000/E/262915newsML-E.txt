China no longer cares about whether it joins the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) , the official China Daily on Tuesday quoted a senior customs official as saying . 
&quot; Accession or not , China has become indifferent and doesn &apos;t care any more , &quot; the newspaper quoted Wu Jiahuang , director general of the tariffs department of China &apos;s General Administration of Customs , as saying . 
China &apos;s past bid for entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) and current attempts to join the WTO that succeeded it as the leading global trade organisation were like a &quot; sunken boat &quot; and an &quot; ailing tree &quot; , Wu said . 
China &apos;s senior leadership had concluded that negotiations with WTO members on the terms of its entry were politically tainted , the newspaper quoted him as saying . 
&quot; In their anxiety to carve out markets in China , chief WTO member countries have ignored China &apos;s rightful reasons to protect its national industries , &quot; he said . 
Beijing is seeking to join the WTO on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries , but some members -- with the United States most vocal among them -- have argued that China &apos;s economy is too large and powerful to be given such treatment .
