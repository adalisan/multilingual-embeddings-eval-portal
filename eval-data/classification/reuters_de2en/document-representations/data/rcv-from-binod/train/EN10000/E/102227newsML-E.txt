Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Tuesday year-on-year inflation should fall to around 10 percent next year from a likely 18-19 percent in 1996 and 130 percent in 1995 . 
Chernomyrdin , viewed by Western investors as the best guarantor of continued Russian economic reform , told the Federation Council upper house of parliament that monthly inflation would be under one percent for the rest of this year . 
consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in September after a seasonally influenced fall of 0.2 percent in August . 
&quot; We are sticking to some basic indicators in the budget and real inflation should not exceed 10 percent , &quot; Chernomyrdin said . 
the lower house of parliament is due to debate the budget on Friday . 
deputies are expected to consider a series of laws on Wednesday which will provide the legal framework needed for some of the revenue-raising measures . 
Chernomyrdin said Russia &apos;s key budget task was to raise revenues , because there was no way to cut spending further . 
but the government would use non-inflationary means to close the budget gap . 
&quot; There is no use asking us to switch on the printing presses , &quot; Chernomyrdin said . 
&quot; Doing so would only bring short-term relief -- for a week , for a month -- but in the long run it will only make things worse .
