Mexican stocks sharply extended their initial gains to a new intraday record in early trade on Monday . 
dealers said stocks were in heavy demand due to investor relief that Sunday &apos;s mid-term elections had taken place in relative calm despite the ruling party suffering its worst setback since 1929 . 
the leading IPC share index was up 49.88 points , or 1.07 percent , at 4,694.48 . 
&quot; buyers have stepped in now , after a slow start . 
stocks have opened across the board , they &apos;re in demand after the elections , &quot; a desk trader said . 
Mexicans voted on Sunday for a new lower house of Congress , a quarter of the Senate , six state governors and , for the first time , a mayor of Mexico City . 
previously , that post had been filled by a presidential nominee . 
preliminary results showed President Ernesto Zedillo &apos;s Institutional Revolutionary Party ( pri ) had lost overall control of the lower house for the first time since 1929 . 
analysts stressed the relative lack of allegations of fraud , that have often marred elections in the past , were almost as important as the results themselves . 
dealers said market heavyweight Telfonos de Mxico ( Telmex ) was leading the rally , riding the coattails of its ADRs , which had risen sharply in tandem with strong gains on Wall Street . 
&quot; Telmex is driving the market . 
it &apos;s also up in New York , and has been bolstered by a stronger peso , &quot; a trader said . 
Telmex was up 20 centavos to 20.10 pesos . 
Telmex ADRs were up 15 / 16 to 50-11 / 16 in New York . 
benchmark 48-hour peso contracts were trading 4.3 centavos stronger at 7.9010 / 7.9040 per dollar . 
dealers said one of the few early casualties was financial firm Banacci , which had fallen 40 centavos to 19.10 pesos on a stock downgrade . 
trading volume had improved from a slow open to 34.7 million shares . 
on the broad market , gainers far outnumbered sliders by 56 to five of a total 81 stocks that had changed hands .
