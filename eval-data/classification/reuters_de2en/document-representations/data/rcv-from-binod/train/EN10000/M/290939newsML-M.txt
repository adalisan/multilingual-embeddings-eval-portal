Thailand &apos;s capital market on Tuesday welcomed a plan for the first domestic government bond in several years , saying it will create a needed benchmark for the secondary market and cheaper funds for state enterprises . 
&quot; It is a very good move . 
we would really like to see it happen soon , &quot; said Somjin Sornpaisarn , deputy general manager of the Bond Dealers &apos; Club . 
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan told Reuters on Monday the government plans to issue government bonds for the first time in 10 years sometime this year . 
the aim of the issue is to create a benchmark for the debt market . 
because the government has no fiscal deficit that needs to be financed , the proceeds from bond issues will be used to re-lend to state enterprises for projects . 
&quot; The scheme will benefit the country on two fronts . 
it will definitely help develop the secondary market , which needs quality and actively-traded bonds as a benchmark , &quot; Somjin said . 
&quot; Moreover , since it is cheaper to raise funds through government bonds , the state enterprises will enjoy cheaper funds , &quot; he said . 
the idea of issuing government bonds even though Thailand is not running a deficit was initally proposed by the previous administration . 
but the scheme was delayed due to the recent change in government . 
Amnuay said he would propose amended legislation by the end of January that would allow the government to issue bonds even though it did not face a budget deficit . 
if approved by the cabinet , the draft has to go before parliament before it can become law . 
although state enterprises and the central banks currently issue bonds , the issues have done little to help establish a benchmark or standards for the market . 
most of the bonds were used by financial institutions for reserve obligations , which they have to meet on the seventh and 22nd of every month , and therefore were not actively traded . 
the reserve required by the central bank is seven percent of deposit , comprising at least two percent of cash at the central bank , no more than 2.5 percent of cash at the commercial bank with the remainder in interest-bearing instruments . 
&quot; So , the prices of these bonds barely reflects the condition of the money market because of the special value of bonds to this limited circle of players , &quot; said Chao Kengchon of Thai Farmers Research . 
&quot; The move would help the secondary market if the government bond is issued with regularity , &quot; he said . 
currently the market used mostly debentures of major companies with good ratings and liquidity as a benchmark , he added . 
the idea of raising funds through goverment bonds to re-lend to state agencies was once attacked by the opposition as potentially harmful to the state enterprises &apos; financial discipline . 
the critics said state enterprises should not have easy access to cheap funds unless they worked hard to earn a good rating . 
but Somjin of the Bond Dealers &apos; Club said there was a solution . 
&quot; The government can lend the money to the state enterprises based on their rating , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The cost for lower-rated agencies , for example , could be higher than those with better ratings but lower than what ( it ) would cost them normally if they issue their own bond .
