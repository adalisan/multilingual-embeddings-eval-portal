the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) on Friday defended the humanitarian agency &apos;s role during World War Two and said new allegations of Nazi infiltration were a matter for historians . 
Cornelio Sommaruga also said he did not expect the Geneva-based institution to be harmed by the charges in U.S. documents , adding that it was judged by its current work in many conflicts worldwide . 
in an interview with Reuters , Sommaruga said he was &quot; very much surprised &quot; by news reports on the previously secret U.S. intelligence documents alleging the agency was used and &quot; probably controlled &quot; at its highest levels by German intelligence during the war . 
documents of the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) , the wartime forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency , allege that ICRC employees worked as agents conveying military information to Berlin . 
they also allege Red Cross pouches were used to ferry German assets into Switzerland and the group itself was used to smuggle German agents across European borders . 
Sommaruga said : &quot; We were very much surprised by the articles that have been published ... Certainly , if there were errors , it is good that they are clarified . 
but it is important that the ICRC contributes to getting clarity , to shed as much light as possible on what happened 50 years ago . 
but he said he wished to defend the staff of the ICRC at that time who were committed to helping the victims of war . 
&quot; Let us not forget that the ICRC visited millions of prisoners of war . 
let us not forget that 11,000 visits were made to camps . 
let us not forget that 143 million messages were transmitted between prisoners of war and their families . 
Sommaruga said the agency has opened its own archives to the public from the wartime period and that it had asked an independent historian to study issues related to &quot; certain delegates &quot; ( staff ) during World War Two . 
an ICRC spokesman said on Thursday that the agency had been informed earlier about an alleged pro-Nazi employee in Turkey and had asked an independent historian to investigate . 
the employee was accused of using the ICRC pouch to transfer funds . 
&quot; He did in fact misuse the ICRC diplomatic pouch to transfer funds , but we don &apos;t know what these funds were , whether they were Jewish funds , &quot; the spokesman , Kim Gordon-Bates , said . 
Sommaruga said that the mainly-Swiss ICRC enjoyed &quot; good contacts &quot; with the U.S. authorities and New York Republican Senator Alfonse D &apos;Amato , who heads a Senate Banking Committee investigating missing Jewish funds . 
last year , the ICRC , which coordinates relief to civilians in wartime and enforces Geneva Conventions governing treatment of prisoners and civilians , acknowledged for the first time its &quot; moral failure &quot; during the war . 
the acknowledgement , made by Sommaruga , referred to the ICRC &apos;s failure to denounce atrocities against Jews and other minorities in Hitler &apos;s concentration camps . 
the OSS documents , marked &quot; Washington office items not previously released &quot; , were recently found in the U.S. National Archives by World Jewish Congress researchers trying to trace assets of Holocaust victims . 
copies of several documents were made available to Reuters .
