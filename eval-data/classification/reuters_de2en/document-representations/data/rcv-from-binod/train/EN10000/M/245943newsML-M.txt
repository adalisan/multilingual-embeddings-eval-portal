the Bulgarian Lev inched up to 515-520 per dollar at the close from 530-535 morning levels as foreign currency supply slightly topped demand in the absence of large dollar buyers , dealers said . 
&quot; The market was very calm and trade was thin because no large final clients bid for dollars , &quot; a bank dealer said . 
the lack of dollar demand near 550 levs in the morning indicated the market considered the Lev undervalued and trade consolidated between 515-530 just before midday in volumes between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 , another dealer said . 
foreign currency supply edged up in the afternoon but demand lagged behind because the exchange rate of the offers was still deemed too high by market makers and small clients , dealers said . 
Prime Minister Zhan Videnov on Monday said banks holding long dollar positions risked losing money under a planned currency board regime because it would be introduced in conjunction with a higher level for the Lev than current ones . 
Videnov said he hoped parliament could vote on introduction of the currency board regime on January 2 . 
increased dollar demand from large fuel and energy importers , amid excessively low supply , pressured the Lev to 515-530 at the close on Monday from around 362-364 a week earlier .
