daily wholesale electricity prices in the northeastern U.S. Wednesday were mostly steady from Tuesday &apos;s levels ahead of a cold front expected to arrive late Thursday . 
&quot; It hasn &apos;t changed much ... They know the cold weather is coming , &quot; said a New York electricity trader , when asked about today &apos;s market activity . 
the northeast corner of the country is experiencing a break of mild weather with day readings in the 30-40 degree Fahrenheit range . 
the predicted cold system will likely push temperatures five to 10 degrees down toward winter norms through this weekend . 
the ongoing outage of the 965 megawatt ( MW ) Indian Point 3 nuclear plant also provided support for day-ahead prices , said market sources . 
the New York Power Authority shut the Indian Point , N.Y. , generating unit Saturday to repair its feedwater heaters . 
peak , non-firm electricity prices ( including transmission costs ) for Thursday delivery in the eastern New York Power pool ( NYPP ) held at $ 25.00- $ 26.50 a megawatt hour ( MWh ) . 
prices of eastern NYPP electricity for peak delivery next week were assessed at $ 26.50- $ 29.50 . 
in western NYPP , peak , non-firm power for Thursday was assessed at $ 22.00- $ 24.00 , up from Tuesday &apos;s $ 21.00- $ 23.00 for delivery today . 
higher import demand today from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland ( PJM ) Interconnect region pushed up spot peak power prices in western New York , traders said . 
in the New England Power pool ( NEPOOL ) , peak , non-firm electricity for Thursday delivery at Northeast Utilities &apos; ( NU ) border was quoted in a wider range at $ 30.00- $ 34.00 , compared with $ 30.00- $ 32.00 Tuesday . 
swing natural gas prices in the Northeast stayed flat against Tuesday &apos;s levels . 
spot gas values at the New York City gate were pegged at $ 3.35- $ 3.50 per million British thermal units , nearly unchanged from Tuesday &apos;s $ 3.25- $ 3.50 .
