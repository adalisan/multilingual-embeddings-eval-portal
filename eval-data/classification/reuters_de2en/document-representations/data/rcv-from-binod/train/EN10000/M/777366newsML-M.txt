the won closed higher on Monday , reflecting abundant dollar positions in the market , but dealers said the strength of the local currency was limited on fears of central bank &apos;s interventions . 
&quot; The market was lethargic , trapped in a tight range , &quot; said a foreign bank dealer . 
&quot; Nobody wants to risk the dollar &apos;s upside with ample dollars in the market . 
dealers said the won &apos;s rise was also limited as many hoped the central bank would step in to give a boost in the market . 
the won ended at 888.90 , compared with Friday &apos;s close of 889.30 . 
after opening at 889.00 , the won fell to the day &apos;s low of 889.10 on short-covering and rose to a high of 888.60 on abundant dollars . 
dealers said dollar &apos;s strength against the yen in Tokyo had no direct impact in the won / dollar market . 
&quot; With no specific market impetus , the dollar will fall slightly further and move around the 888 level , &quot; the foreign bank dealer said . 
Tuesday &apos;s mid-rate was expected to be fixed at 888.80 against 889.30 today .
