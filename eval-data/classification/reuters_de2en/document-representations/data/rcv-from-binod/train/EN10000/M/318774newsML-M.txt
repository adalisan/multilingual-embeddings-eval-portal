stocks ended at new highs Monday on more upbeat earnings from high technology companies , but the market was nervous ahead of testimony Tuesday by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on the economy . 
the Dow Jones industrial average ended up 10.77 points at 6,843.87 , surpassing Friday &apos;s record of 6,833.10 . 
in the broader market , advances led declines 1,242 to 1,239 on moderate volume of 440 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
the technology-laced Nasdaq composite index rose 15.23 points to 1,364.28 , a new high . 
Microsoft Corp. , which reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results after Friday &apos;s close , jumped 3-5 / 8 to 90-3 / 4 . 
&quot; The market looked at Microsoft &apos;s numbers and said the underlying fundamentals in technology are still intact , &quot; said Arnie Owen , director of equities at Kaufman Brothers . 
&quot; Technology is still the driver . 
elsewhere , the session was a fairly cautious affair , in part because the bond market was closed for the Martin Luther King Jr holiday . 
also looming was Fed Reserve Chief Greenspan &apos;s testimony Tuesday before the Senate . 
wall Street always carefully scrutinises Greenspan &apos;s comments for any clue about Fed monetary policy , a persistent source of tension for markets . 
with the outcome of the Fed &apos;s next policy meeting in early February still a matter of debate , what Greenspan says about the economy and the stock market &apos;s surge is drawing even sharper attention . 
&quot; If he &apos;s really planning a tightening I think there will be a hint to the Senate tomorrow , &quot; said Edgar Peters , chief investment strategist at PanAgora Asset Management Inc . 
most economists expect no change in interest rates at the meeting on Feb . 4 and 5 of the Federal Open Market Committee . 
but some see sufficient cause in recent employment and other data for the central bank to issue a pre-emptive strike against incipient inflation . 
absent a signal on the interest rate front , corporate earnings will likely continue to dominate investor attention . 
among the companies due to report on Tuesday are International Business machines Corp. and banking giants Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. 
Bank stocks were among the most actively traded issues after Banc One Corp. agreed to a stock swap deal to acquire First USA Inc . , a leading credit card issuer . 
first USA soared 8-7 / 8 to 45-5 / 8 on the news , while Banc One slipped 3-1 / 2 to 41-5 / 8 . 
the Banc One deal sparked interest in other leading card issuers . 
among the strongest were MBNA Corp. , up 2-3 / 8 to 33-1 / 2 , Capital One Financial Corp. , up 4-7 / 8 to 38-3 / 8 , and Advanta Corp. , up 5-9 / 16 to 48-11 / 16 . 
target Therapeutics Inc. surged 10-1 / 4 to 57 on speculation that the company would be acquired by Boston Scientific Corp. A deal was confirmed after the close of trading . 
Boston Scientific , which will pay 1.07 shares for each Target share , fell 4-5 / 8 to 66-7 / 8 ahead of the announcement .
