braving an Arabian sandstorm , a Bangladeshi cyclone and Russian bureacracy , a British grandmother landed on Tuesday on her way to becoming the first woman to fly round the world in a helicopter . 
&quot; We &apos;re here on time and on schedule , &quot; a beaming Jennifer Murray said after stepping from her fire-engine-red chopper at the Torrance airport in suburban Los Angeles . 
&quot; But we still have another three-and-a-half weeks to go to get back to London , &quot; said the whirlybird granny . 
Murray , 56 , is a mother of three , with two grandchildren , has lived for 30 years in Hong Kong . 
she left England on May 10 with co-pilot Quentin Smith in an attempt to become the first woman to fly a helicopter around the world . 
on the latest leg , the pair flew 400 miles ( 700 km ) down the California coast on Tuesday from Oakland . 
but in the ten weeks before , they had flown their tiny Robinson R-44 across Europe , through the Middle East and India to southeast Asia , up into Russia and across the Bering Strait to Alaska . 
Murray , who has less than three years flying experience , said the potentially most dangerous leg was still ahead . 
after crossing the United States , she and Smith will head up Canada &apos;s eastern seaboard before crossing 480 miles ( nearly 800 km ) of sea from Newfoundland to Greenland . 
their flight plan calls for maximum water crossings of five hours . 
although the pair share the flying duties , Murray said of her 32-year-old flying companiion : &quot; He is a champion pilot and if there are any problems , he will take over . 
Oxford-born Smith , who first flew as a child with his pilot father and has more than 4,000 hours of flying experience , joked : &quot; I am really just tagging along for the ride . 
asked by reporters about the flight so far , Murray said they had been fortunate to avoid &quot; fairly major difficulties . 
&quot; There was an enormous sandstorm that closed the airport in Jeddah ( Saudi Arabia ) , but we were lucky to miss it . 
&quot; Then there were two cyclones in Bangladesh that also closed the airports , but we came in between them , &quot; she said . 
&quot; We &apos;ve really had a charmed cycle of weather . 
the biggest difficulty had been man-made , she said . 
&quot; The people are very warm and friendly in Russia but the rules ( for flying ) are very tight . 
it can take five hours ( of bureaucracy ) to get through one airport . 
their chopper , which was built by the Robinson helicopter Co . , in Torrance , was modified , with two of the seats being removed to accomodate a 50-gallon supplementary fuel tank . 
asked how often they stopped for fuel , Murray said : &quot; When we need some , but basically every 5-1 / 2 hours . 
&quot; As for toilet breaks , the answer was simple : &quot; Sometimes it becomes a strain , but we can land , &quot; she said . 
sharing a cockpit with just one other person for more than 10 weeks might be difficult , but Murray said &quot; we are still smiling and still good friends . 
&quot; We don &apos;t really have any boredom and Q ( sic ) has a good line in jokes . 
if all goes well , they will make the trip in just under 100 days and raise some $ 800,000 for the Save the Children charity . 
among the sponsors of her trip are Murray &apos;s husband Simon , who is chairman of Deutsche Bank Asia Pacific .
