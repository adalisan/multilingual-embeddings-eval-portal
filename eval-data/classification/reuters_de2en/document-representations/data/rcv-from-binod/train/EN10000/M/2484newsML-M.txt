new York , Aug 20 - The dollar rose against the Japanese yen Tuesday after a sharp drop in the nation &apos;s trade deficit overshadowed fleeting disappointment that the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged . 
the Commerce Department reported the United States trade gap shrank 23 percent in June as imports of merchandise and petroleum fell sharply . 
while the trade shortfall with Japan rose 3.6 percent in June , the second-quarter deficit of $ 10.5 billion with Japan was the smallest quarterly deficit in five years . 
the trend helped the dollar by decreasing the amount of dollars foreign exporters will need to sell for their local currencies . 
&quot; It was a good trade number , &quot; said Greg Pearman , chief foreign exchange dealer at Credit Commerciale de France in New York . 
&quot; There was definitely one huge buyer today who right after the ( trade ) number bought a lot of dollars for yen . 
after the release of the trade figures , the dollar climbed above 108 yen , where it stayed for the rest of the New York session . 
the Fed &apos;s decision to hold interest rates steady only pressured the dollar temporarily in the afternoon because most traders had expected no change in monetary policy anyway . 
&quot; It &apos;s a fractional disappointment , basically , &quot; said Chris Turner , a currency strategist at the I.D.E.A. 
Inc. consulting firm . 
&quot; We saw recently a survey of 37 primary ( currency ) dealers in the U.S. ( and ) not one of them were going for a Fed rate hike today . 
in late New York trading , the dollar settled at 108.35 yen , up from 107.80 yen late on Monday . 
the dollar rose slightly to 1.4883 German marks from 1.4880 marks . 
the dollar strengthened slightly against the yen in Asia after Eisuke Sakakibara , director-general of Japan &apos;s Ministry of Finance International Finance Bureau said in an interview with the Nikkei Finance Daily newspaper that even if the dollar rises above 110 yen , there is only a small chance of such a rise having an adverse effect on the Japanese economy . 
Sakakibara has been dubbed &quot; Mr. 
yen &quot; by the currency market because he is seen as the key person behind a rise in the dollar back up above 100 yen last year from its record low of 79.75 yen in April 1995 . 
the British pound rose to $ 1.5480 from $ 1.5455 late on Monday . 
the dollar ended little changed at 1.2070 Swiss francs .
