Austrian far-right leader Joerg Haider said Chancellor Franz Vranitzky , who resigned on Saturday , had ruined the Social Democratic Party and the time had come for him to go . 
&quot; Every politician has his time , &quot; Haider told Austrian state television shortly after Vranitzky announced his resignation after almost 11 years in power . 
&quot; It &apos;s always been clear that the only question was which one of us two could hold out for longer . 
my prophecy that I would still work for Austria while he would long be gone has come true , &quot; Haider said . 
Vranitzky , whose Social Democrats rule in coalition with the conservative People &apos;s Party , has ruled out any chance of a partnership with the far right . 
despite rumours to the contrary , People &apos;s Party leader Wolfgang Schuessel has also said he would not join a coalition with Haider . 
asked whether the political face of Austria would change with Vranitzky &apos;s resignation , Haider said the old two-party system had already begun to crumble . 
&quot; The political reality is a different one ( now ) . 
we already have numerous contacts not just with the People &apos;s Party but also ( with ) the Social Democrats , &quot; he said . 
but Vranitzky , speaking to reporters after announcing his withdrawal from the political scene , reiterated his party remained strictly opposed to any future cooperation with Haider , his most bitter political foe . 
both men took over the leadership of their parties within months of each other in 1986 . 
&quot; I have presented a strategy paper three weeks ago in which I drew a clear demarcation line against the Freedom Party . 
anybody who takes over responsibility in the Social Democratic Party is bound by that , &quot; he said . 
Haider repeated his goal to become Austrian chancellor before the turn of the century . 
&quot; Today &apos;s events were one more important step in that direction , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It has become clear to millions of Austrians not only that I managed to hold out longer , but also that I earned political trust while Vranitzky is leaving behind a heap of rubble in his Social Democratic Party . 
his nationalist Freedom Party , boasting the largest parliamentary representation of any European far-right group , scored its biggest victory in last year &apos;s European Parliament elections , when it came almost even with the Social Democrats . 
the outcome was the worst result for the Social Democrats in their history , coming just 60,000 votes behind Haider &apos;s party and losing a swathe of their traditional working class support to the far right .
