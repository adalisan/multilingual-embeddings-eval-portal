UK natural gas prices firmed across the board on Wednesday , traders and brokers said , but the market was less busy than in many recent days . 
&quot; It &apos;s been very quiet , &quot; said a trader . 
&quot; Basically the reason it &apos;s firmed is that offers are thin on the ground because of lack of interest . 
markets have been volatile in the last few days , with prices falling early on Tuesday before rising slightly in the afternoon , and then continuing the rise throughout the day on Wednesday . 
the busiest period was the prompt market , with trade thought boosted by a flexibility mechanism purchase during the day . 
one seller who sold within day gas at St Fergus at 12.00 pence a therm speculated that a planned shutdown on the sage system from 0500 GMT on Wednesday for three weeks may have had an influence on the flexibility mechanism &apos;s need to buy . 
there was also good interest on the day ahead market at rising prices as the day wore on . 
one seller reported doing a deal at 11.40 pence a therm in the morning , but trade was done as high as 11.90 pence later . 
and there was also some interest seen for weekend gas . 
further out , the only confirmed trade was done for periods of a year , with deals seen in both the gas year from October and the year from April 1998 . 
there were rumours that trade was done in the third quarter at 11.05 pence a therm , and in June at both 11.15 pence and 11.20 pence , but this was not confirmed . 
cold weather kept gas consumption relatively high . 
Transco announced on Wednesday that the forecast for Thursday is 10.1 Celsius , down from a seasonal normal 13.6 Celsius . 
temperatures have got steadily lower over the week . 
as a result demand is forecast at 194 mcm , or 45 percent of peak day demand . 
trade was done in June , March , April and May , with June trading and settling at 11.20 pence a therm , up 0.25 pence . 
although only four trades were done , it was still seen as encouraging for the future of the contract given that it was untraded for long periods last week .
