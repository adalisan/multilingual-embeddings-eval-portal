Zaire has stepped up a campaign against neighbours Rwanda and Burundi and relief agencies , accusing them of promoting or aiding armed Tutsi infiltrators on destabilisation missions to its volatile eastern refugee zone . 
government spokesman Oscar Lugendo said on state television on Saturday that Rwanda had sent the Tutsi infiltrators , whom he described as members of the Banyamulenge ethnic group , some of whose members have lived in eastern Zaire for generations . 
human rights watchdog Amnesty International accused Zairean troops and officials of atrocities against Banyamulenge civilians in eastern Zaire over the past month and said officials and politicians had incited violence against them . 
Lugendo warned relief agencies that they would be banned if they did not limit themselves to aid work . 
&quot; Given all the violations noted on the part of certain humanitarian agencies , Zaire will systematically identify all humanitarian NGOs and evaluate all their activities , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Zaire draws the attention of all humanitarian organisations operating in North and South Kivu to the fact that their involvement in acts contrary to their mission will cause the government to end their activities , &quot; Lugendo added . 
he confirmed that the activities of the International Organisation for Migration ( IOM ) had been suspended . 
&quot; The IOM , which has gone beyond the framework envisaged in the cooperation accords it signed with Zaire , has been banned until further notice from operating on Zairean territory , &quot; he said 
volatile eastern Zaire is host to over a million Hutus who fled Rwanda in 1994 fearing reprisals after the massacre by Hutu hardliners of hundreds of thousands of minority Tutsis and the civil war victory of Tutsi-led rebels . 
Lugendo said Zairean troops killed three Rwandan soldiers and captured five at Kiringye in Uvira region on August 31 . 
he said Tutsis from Rwanda &apos;s army who had infiltrated South Kivu were Banyamulenge . 
&quot; These elements are commanded in their infiltration operations by other Banyamulenge , former officers in the Zairean army , who went to Rwanda after the victory of the ( Tutsi-led ) Patriotic Front in 1994 , &quot; he added . 
Amnesty acknowledged that the Zairean government had a right to take action against armed Tutsis in the region bordering Burundi but said that an entire ethnic group could not be held responsible for alleged violence by some of its members . 
&quot; There is no justification for this calculated abuse of human rights -- including unlawful killings , disappearances , severe beatings and deportation or refoulement to another country , &quot; it added in a statement issued in London . 
Lugendo put the number of infiltrators at 600 . 
&quot; Vehicles apparently belonging notably to humanitarian organisations provided their transport at Cyangugu in Rwanda and in Burundi &apos;s Cibitoke province , &quot; he said . 
State radio , quoting members of parliament from North and South Kivu , said : &quot; All non-governmental organisations creating problems in the east of the country should be banned . 
the U.N. has rejected allegations that its relief staff , some of whom were beaten up by Zairean soldiers , have helped armed groups and plans to send an envoy to Kinshasa . 
Rwanda and Burundi , which is ruled by a Tutsi-dominated army , have denied any links with infiltrators .
