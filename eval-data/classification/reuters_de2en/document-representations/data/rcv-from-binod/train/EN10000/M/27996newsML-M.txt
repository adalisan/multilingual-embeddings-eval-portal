Mexico will be at the epicentre of emerging markets activity this week but investors will be searching for clues from key U.S. employment figures , due out on Friday , to future U.S. monetary policy . 
&quot; The key issue will be the U.S. employment report on Friday and its effect on the longbond , &quot; said one London-based analyst . 
markets will be cautious ahead of August employment figures after signs of a strong pickup in U.S. economic growth last week stoked speculation of a rise in U.S. interest rates . 
&quot; The market has had a good has had a good run . 
it makes you wonder if things can continue , &quot; West Merchant Bank economic adviser Peter West said . 
Mexico will be a key focus as investors digest President Ernesto Zedillo &apos;s upbeat address to the nation , delivered on Sunday , and monitor the impact of a resurgence of leftwing guerrilla violence . 
&quot; The rally in Mexico will lead the rest of Latin American ( Bradys ) up , &quot; said Jerome Booth , ANZ Grindlays head of emerging markets research . 
in his speech , Zedillo declared Mexico &apos;s economic crisis was over , though he warned that it would be a long time before ordinary Mexicans felt the benefit in their living standards . 
investors said enthusiasm for Mexico should continue on the back of robust second-quarter GDP growth of 7.2 percent . 
&quot; The GDP growth was above expectations , indicating a general recovery and the end of the recession , &quot; said Booth . 
despite the rosy economic outlook , markets - wary over the strength of the Mexican peso - will remain cautious on mounting leftwing guerrilla violence . 
but because of Mexico &apos;s constructive economic and political outlook , investors are unlikely to panic , said analysts . 
&quot; It &apos;s just noise . 
the political situation is stable . 
and the economic programme is working , &quot; said ANZ economist Jerome Booth . 
over 12 were killed in Mexico following surprise leftists guerrilla attacks , the worst in over two years , last week . 
the attacks , which appeared closely coordinated , marked the most serious fighting in Mexico since the Zapatista rebellion erupted in the southeastern state of Chiapas in January 1994 . 
in Argentina , markets will await consumer wholesale prices on Tuesday but debt prices should remain underpinned by improving economic sentiment . 
markets will also follow the progress of fiscal reforms , aimed at reversing the widening budget deficit which hit $ 2.5 billion by mid-year , through Congress . 
the government has said the deficit would have swelled to $ 6.6 billion by year-end without the measures , expected to be approved by Congress in early October . 
and do think there will be more cooperation from Congress , &quot; said Booth . 
Russia will also bask in the spotlight this week but debt prices could remain under pressure on concerns over President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s health . 
investors said a visit to Russia by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will place the spotlight firmly back on Yeltsin &apos;s health . 
investor confidence in Venezuela , hit after setbacks to the privatisation programme last week , will remain an issue . 
but some investors recommend buying on the dips if Venezuelan Bradys and stocks take a dive . 
&quot; If there is profittaking , one ought to buy on weakness , &quot; said West Merchant Bank &apos;s West . 
&quot; The ecomomic situation is for an improving outlook from a weak base . 
the economy is at the bottom of the cycle and we should see a recovery in activity next year , &quot; he added . 
the International Finance Corporation index on Latin America was down 0.6 percent at 524.72 from the previous Friday . 
Asia was up 0.1 percent on the week at 251.47 , and Europe , Middle East and Africa was quoted up 2.8 percent on the week at 137.26 .
