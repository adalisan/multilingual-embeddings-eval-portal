French shares stormed to another record closing high on Tuesday , boosted by rich liquidity and a robust dollar , and analysts said the Paris bourse looked set to advance further , at least in the short term . 
the blue-chip CAC-40 stock index closed up 85.78 points or three percent at 2,944.04 points on turnover of 11.1 billion francs , eclipsing other strong European markets . 
the sturdy U.S. currency has supported recent sessions , holding out prospects of cheaper exports , a buoyant Wall Street and reinvestment of dividend payouts . 
but the main boost , traders said , has come from expectations the bourse will benefit from a 91-billion-franc wall of cash the government is due to return to investors on July 16 when the so-called Balladur bond expires . 
the 1993 bond was issued by conservative former prime minister Edouard Balladur to fund an economic recovery plan . 
the stock market is expected to siphon off a big chunk of it as investors seek tax shelters for their funds . 
&quot; Traders will be worried about being short the market and being in a bear squeeze and that &apos;s what we may be in the grips of for the next couple of weeks , &quot; said JP Morgan analyst Gary Dugan . 
worries that the election victory of the Socialists last month would hit share prices so far have failed to materialise . 
in fact , since the June 1 vote , the Bourse has gained around 13 percent and is up some 26 percent on the year . 
&quot; They &apos;ve given encouraging signs they won &apos;t be too hard on investors . 
they &apos;re not like &apos; New Labour &apos; under Tony Blair but they don &apos;t seem as bad as their programme seemed , &quot; one trader said . 
analysts are reluctant to give year-end targets , the bourse having long zipped past most objectives of around 2,450 . 
but one said the next big goal the market was looking at was 3,200 . 
analysts say there are a number of bullish factors , such as expectations corporate profits will be strong this year and next , thanks to an expected recovery in the economy . 
analysts are revising overall corporate earnings estimates higher -- the first time this has happened in nearly a decade . 
Dollar-earnings stocks are considered good plays , such as tyre maker Michelin or beauty products firm L &apos;Oreal . 
financial companies -- banks and insurers -- also have potential . 
&quot; They have a bit of recovering to do , &quot; said one analyst . 
analysts in the main believe the rise is sustainable -- especially in what is expected to be a tight fiscal and low interest rate climate over the next couple of years . 
&quot; Paris not flying alone . 
these are buoyant global markets . 
valuations are stretched everywhere but you could argue less so in Paris , &quot; said one analyst . 
&quot; Because the U.S. market is looking so strong , I can only see the markets going ahead , &quot; said a trader . 
all of this supposes the Socialists do not spoil the party . 
there are some clouds on the horizon amid talk the government may exploit improving corporate fortunes by slapping higher capital gains taxes on firms as part of measures to lower the public deficit and qualify for European monetary union .
