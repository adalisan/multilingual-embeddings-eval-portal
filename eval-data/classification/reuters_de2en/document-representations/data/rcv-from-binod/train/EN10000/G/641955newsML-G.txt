Algerian President Liamine Zeroual crafted the conditions for Thursday &apos;s parliamentary election , seeing it as laying the ground for a democracy that leaves most power with the head of state and ensures Islamic fundamentalists cannot take over . 
a former general , Zeroual was well aware that the military , which dominated the oil-and-gas producing nation for more than 30 years , would not accept &quot; cohabitation &quot; with Islamists who threatened the secular-though-Moslem republic and who they blamed for conflict in which tens of thousands have died . 
Zeroual comes across in public as a man with little charisma but apparently infinite patience to cajole and persuade others to back him , or find themselves swept from the political mainstream . 
appointed to power in January 1994 , he showed the line he planned to take over the bloodshed -- a carrot-and-stick approach to the militants . 
&quot; The army has on many occasions given proof of its goodwill and absolute openness to search for solutions that may lead the country out of the current political crisis , &quot; he said . 
but he warned : &quot; The retreat of the army from political life does not mean it will stand with its arms crossed in the face of the dangerous excesses that have threatened and continue to threaten the future of the country . 
Zeroual , 56 next month , sent troops to crush armed rebels while he tried twice to negotiate with detained leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) to end the crisis through talks . 
his attempts ended in failure . 
since then , the FIS , thwarted from taking power when the authorities in 1992 cancelled the last general election , has been totally excluded from any hint of negotiation . 
Zeroual put himself up in November 1995 in Algeria &apos;s first multi-candidate presidential election , and gained more than 60 percent of the votes . 
born on July 3 , 1941 , in eastern Batna area from which many of Algeria &apos;s military leaders have come , Zeroual fought as an officer in the independence war against France , joining up , according to his supporters , at the age of 16 . 
in 1965 , three years after independence , he went to the Soviet Union for military training and was then posted to head an artillery unit at Sidi Bel Abbes , in west Algeria . 
promoted to artillery captain in 1974 , he was sent for special training at a French military college . 
promoted to major in 1975 he took command of the military combat school in Batna before moving to Cherchell military academy , as a lieutenant-colonel . 
in the 1980s , he commanded three of Algeria &apos;s military regions -- the army &apos;s key operational posts -- before becoming land forces chief in 1988 . 
he resigned from the military in 1989 after a dispute with then-president Chadli Benjedid and became ambassador to Romania before being recalled and named defence minister in July 1993 . 
married with three children , Zeroual showed his confidence ahead of the election by attending the Organisation of African Unity summit in Harare , returning only on Wednesday .
