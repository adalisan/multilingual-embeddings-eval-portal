Germany &apos;s banking association ( BdB ) said on Thursday the Bundesbank &apos;s decision to set a two-year corridor for money supply growth would reduce monetary policy risks ahead of the launch of the single European currency . 
&quot; The setting of a two-year target underpins the long-term orientation of monetary policy , &quot; the BdB said in a statement . 
the Bundesbank tightened its M3 monetary supply target to 3.5-6.5 percent from four to seven percent this year , leaving open the final setting of a goal for 1998 until the end of next year .
