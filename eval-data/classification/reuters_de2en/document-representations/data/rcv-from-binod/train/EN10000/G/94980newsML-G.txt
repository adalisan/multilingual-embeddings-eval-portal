German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Thursday the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) should work with NATO and the European Union to bolster future security in Europe . 
Kinkel , speaking to the OSCE &apos;s Vienna-based permanent council on the sixth anniversary of German unification , said the body should use its summit in Lisbon in December to show it was ready to play its part in an integrated European security structure for the 21st century . 
&quot; It ( the summit ) must send a signal that the OSCE is willing and able to make a considerable independent contribution to the European security architecture , &quot; he told ambassadors from the forum &apos;s 53 member nations . 
the OSCE includes most of Europe , the United States and Canada . 
Kinkel said the OSCE , the only pan-European Atlantic institution , was vital to European security , but the relationships between other organisations , such as NATO , had to be clarified . 
&quot; What is required is a practical burden-sharing arrangement , rather than a system of hierarchy between NATO , the OSCE and the European Union , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Our goal is greater cooperation in the whole of Europe , without omitting any issue or any country , &quot; he added . 
on a visit to Vienna two weeks ago , Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Moscow wanted the OSCE to play a greater role in Europe , warning that NATO &apos;s planned expansion eastwards could reinforce old lines of division across the continent . 
Primakov said the OSCE was uniquely positioned to be strengthened into Europe &apos;s main security body . 
Klinkel paid tribute to the work of the OSCE , which he said had passed its hardest test in supervising Bosnia &apos;s first postwar elections on September 14 . 
&quot; The Bosnian elections organised by the OSCE are not yet a guarantee of real peace but they represent a decisive milestone in the peace process , &quot; he said . 
but Klinkel cautioned the OSCE not to rest on its laurels . 
decision-making needed to be simplified and the organisation &apos;s rules , which are currently only politically binding , needed to be enshrined in international law to become more effective , he said .
