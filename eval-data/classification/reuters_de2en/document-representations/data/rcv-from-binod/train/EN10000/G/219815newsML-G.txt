Russia said on Wednesday it had finished building the first module , which will form the core of the international space station Alpha , a year to the day before the module &apos;s planned launch date . 
Sergei Shayevich , a senior official at the Khrunichev Space Centre where the module is being built , said the centre had begun ground tests on the so-called functional cargo block ( FGB ) , which will form the core of the orbital station . 
&quot; We have finished assembly on time , &quot; Shayevich told a news conference . 
by 1998 three Alpha modules are due to be in orbit . 
the space station is due for completion by early next century . 
in August 1995 , Khrunichev and Boeing Co signed a $ 190 million contract to develop , build and conduct ground tests of the FGB , which will be launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on November 27 next year . 
&quot; I think we will continue cooperation with Boeing under the Alpha project , &quot; Shayevich said , but did not give more details . 
he also said assembly of a three-stage proton rocket to lift the 20-tonne FGB into orbit was two months ahead of schedule . 
the FGB will carry equipment to provide energy for the $ 30 billion Alpha station , the world &apos;s first orbiting international laboratory . 
it will be equipped with special adaptors to allow U.S. space shuttles , Russian manned and unmanned craft and modules built by other partners in the project to dock with it . 
the United States , the European Space Agency , Canada , Italy and Japan are also involved in the Alpha project , under which the space station is due to be completed early next century . 
the Alpha orbital station will replace Russia &apos;s Mir station which has been in orbit for 10 years and is nearing the end of its useful life . 
earlier this year , space agency head Yuri Koptev said participation in the Alpha project would allow Russia to keep its space industry going and develop space research . 
he said Russia could not afford to build and launch a replacement for Mir on its own . 
&quot; The Alpha must work in orbit for 15 years , &quot; Shayevich said , adding that the FGB will also be used to store scientific equipment and six tonnes of rocket fuel . 
Vernon Steele , Boeing technical liaison manager , said the FGB assembly had gone well . 
&quot; We hope the module will be safe and comfortable for Alpha &apos;s crew , &quot; he said . 
Shayevich also said that Khrunichev was assembling an FGB mock-up for crew training . 
in October , the first crew due to visit Alpha began several months of training in the Star City space centre near Moscow . 
U.S. astronaut William shepherd and two Russian cosmonauts -- Anatoly Solovyov and Sergei Krikalyov -- are scheduled to begin a 165-day flight aboard the partially-built Alpha station in May 1998 . 
by then , three Alpha modules are due to be in orbit . 
the space station is due for completion by early next century . 
Russia &apos;s space programme suffered an embarrassing loss earlier this month when its unmanned Mars-96 probe crashed into the sea off Chile a day after liftoff . 
the probe took off two years late due to a lack of state funds .
