following are comments from U.S. experts after the Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.2 percent in March compared to a revised 1.5-percent increase in February . 
experts in a Reuters poll had expected a 0.6-percent rise in overall sales . 
Ayers was speaking on Reuters Financial Television . 
Inc : &quot; Retail sales saw a strong upward revision to February &apos;s number , from 0.8 to 1.5 percent . 
so overall , it is a bit stronger than expected . 
&quot; I think it confirms that consumer spending was strong in the first quarter . 
it may encourage some perceptions that consumer spending will slow in the second quarter . 
there is some possiblility that spending will slow , but this data confirms a strong first quarter . 
again with this month &apos;s report , it looks like consumer spending is on track for about 4.5 percent growth in first quarter . 
&quot; This reconfirms that the consumer is in very good shape given the solid underlying fundamentals for the economy . 
the March number was a little below expectations on overall sales , although excluding autos , which is what feeds directly into GDP , everything was in line with expectations . 
the March data ex-autos was very strong , and we think , the auto component which came out down 0.6 and dragged down the overall is probably going to be revised up next month . 
&quot; So on net we &apos;re probably looking at some revisions to ( the GDP accounts . 
) Whereas before , we were looking for a five percent ( consumption ) quarter at least , now we &apos;re looking for a 5.5 percent to 5.6 percent consumption quarter at least . 
you have a sitution where the February numbers almost doubled in size . 
total goes to 1.5 ( percent ) from 0.8 ( percent ) . 
and you have the ex auto number going to 0.9 ( percent ) from 0.5 ( percent ) . 
this is going to bias the GDP numbers up quite a bit .
