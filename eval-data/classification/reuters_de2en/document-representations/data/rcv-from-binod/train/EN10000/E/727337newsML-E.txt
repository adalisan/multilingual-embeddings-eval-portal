Greece is considering reducing corporate tax rates in an attempt to attract more foreign and European investment and capital , said deputy Finance Minister George Drys . 
&quot; The government is seriously considering reducing ( current ) tax brackets for companies , &quot; Drys told Sunday paper &apos; To Vima &apos; . 
Greece , along with Germany and Denmark , has the highest corporate tax rates in the European Union and that must change , he said . 
&quot; Given the evolving and continuously increasing competition between the member-states of the European Union to lure capital and investments , Greece will have to adjust its taxation system to the present-day demands of the market , to avoid adverse effects on its economy , &quot; Drys said .
