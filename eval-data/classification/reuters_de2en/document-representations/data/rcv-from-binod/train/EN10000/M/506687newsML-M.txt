Israeli shares closed higher on Monday in quiet trading amid profit-taking , traders said . 
the benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares rose 0.75 percent , or 1.91 points , to 255.36 on all-share turnover of 97 million shekels against 92 million shekels on Sunday . 
the Maof 25 blue chip index closed 0.75 percent higher at 264.96 . 
&quot; The session opened with nice gains and the market rose 1.1 percent , but towards the end of the trading day investors started taking profits and the market weakened , &quot; said Yossi Weidelfeld at Eyal Securities . 
&quot; The market is stable and looks good . 
the offering of Israel Discount Bank is very encouraging and is a clear indicator of a recovery of the primary market , &quot; said Michael Politzer at the Central Securities Corp. 
the second tranche to the public of the Israel Discount Bank offering took place on Monday . 
the market closed before the government announced the final result of the offering . 
but traders said it was successful . 
the government held the institutional tranche of the 17 percent offering in the first week of April . 
Israel Discount Bank , the second most active share , lost 1.25 percent to 343 agorot on turnover of 5.8 million shekels . 
&quot; A recovery of the primary market will eventually lead also to an improvement in the secondary market , &quot; Politzer added . 
Weidelfeld said that there is much uncertainty in the market and its impossible to say where it is going . 
&quot; During the last week the Maof has been moving between 260 and 265 points . 
today it tested the 265 level but it failed to breakthrough . 
if the market rises above 265 it can even reach 290 , if not it might fall to 240 , &quot; Weidelfeld added . 
Super-Sol gained 0.5 percent to 973 agorot . 
Carnegie Emerging Markets initiated coverage of Super-Sol with a buy recommendation saying the shares were a good value in comparison with other emerging market food retailers . 
Koor Industries , the most active share , fell 0.25 percent to 29,974 agorot on volume of 6.3 million shekels . 
the company announced to the Tel Aviv bourse on Monday that its wholly owned subsidiary Telrad Holdings Ltd , decided to purchase $ 5 million worth of Koor shares . 
the purchases will be made both on and off the floor and will take into account the share price and state of the economy , the notice to the bourse said . 
the shares will be held for at least three months . 
Bank Hapoalim , the third active share , gained 1.0 percent to 720 on volume of 5.1 million shekels .
