the commander of NATO forces in Europe said on Monday that land mines and the military potential of factional police forces in Bosnia were key concerns for international peacekeepers there . 
&quot; I think it ( mine clearing ) has not moved as quickly as we would like , &quot; U.S. Army Gen. George Joulwan told reporters . 
&quot; Every week in Bosnia , civilians are being maimed or killed by mines . 
the supreme allied commander of forces in Europe ( SACEUR ) said clearing thousands of mines sown during the civil war was the responsibility of Serbs , Moslems and Croats and the effort should be increased as a NATO-led peacekeeping force of more than 31,000 begins a new 18-month mission there . 
&quot; The issue of mines in Yugoslavia is going to be with us for a long time to come &quot; Joulwan said at a breakfast with reporters and added this was an example of the international problem of dealing with so-called &quot; dumb mines . 
the four-star general , based in Belgium in a dual role of NATO &apos;S SACEUR and of U.S. forces in Europe , also expressed concern over the potential for violence involving police forces in Bosnia . 
these police units , which the New York Times has reported may be stockpiling mortars and other weapons , are sometimes commanded by Serbs , Moslems or Croats loyal to their own factions rather than to all citizens . 
&quot; I share your concern on the size and armaments of some of the former warring fractions &apos; police forces , &quot; Joulwan said in response to a question . 
he noted that the police forces were being overseen by an unarmed contingent of fewer than 2,000 international police officers sponsored by the United Nations . 
&quot; I would like to see an increased role and mandate for them , &quot; said Joulwan of the international monitors . 
at the same time , he said , local police forces in Bosnia must be trained to efficiently handle routine law enforcement functions so that peacekeeping troops were not faced with such tasks . 
the United States is providing 8,500 troops as part of the new international peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Joulwan said the American soldiers would be rotated every six months , from about April .
