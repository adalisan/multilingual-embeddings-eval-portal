in a newly declassified report , congressional investigators have charged that the Pentagon exaggerated the success of the F-117A stealth fighter and other high-tech U.S. arms in the 1991 Gulf War . 
the report , released by the Congressional General Accounting Office on Monday , said the F-117A and other &quot; smart &quot; arms such as the Tomahawk cruise missiles were very effective , but that actual accuracy rates did not match claims by the military and arms makers after the war . 
the radar-avoiding attack jets , laser-guided bombs and cruise missiles were used by U.S. forces against targets in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq during the Gulf War . 
none of the stealth fighters was lost to Iraqi fire . 
&quot; The F-117A bomb hit rate ranged between 41 and 60 percent , which is considered to be highly effective , but is still less than the 80 percent hit rate reported after the war , &quot; according to the report by Congress &apos; investigative arm . 
it also said early claims of 98 per cent effectiveness for computer chip-guided Tomahawks was exaggerated and &quot; the claim by the Defence Department and contractors of one-target , one-bomb capability for laser-guided munitions was not demonstrated in the air campaign . 
the unclassified version of the GAO report was first released by the New York Times last summer . 
the Pentagon conceded in a letter released with the report that there were &quot; shortcomings &quot; in smart weapons and in the military &apos;s combat strike assessment capabilities . 
&quot; The Defence Department is well along in its programme to correct these shortcomings , &quot; it added .
