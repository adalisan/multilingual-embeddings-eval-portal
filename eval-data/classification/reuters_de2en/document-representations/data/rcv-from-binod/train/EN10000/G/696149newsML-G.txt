Chinese President Jiang Zemin arrived in Hong Kong on Monday to take back the territory from Britain as the last governor left his colonial seat of power with tears , handshakes and the mournful skirl of bagpipes . 
Jiang , the first Chinese head of state to set foot on Hong Kong soil , flew in aboard a special flight accompanied by other leaders , including Premier Li Peng and Zhuo Lin , the widow of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping . 
schoolchildren waving plastic flowers and red five-star flags of China clapped and cheered as he walked down red-carpeted stairs from the aircraft in a tropical downpour . 
he was met by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and incoming Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa , a shipping magnate chosen by Beijing to run the city of 6.4 million people 
at the stroke of midnight ( 1600 GMT ) , Jiang was to receive the Crown Colony from Queen Elizabeth &apos;s heir , Prince Charles , ending an imperial reign of 156 years . 
half an hour before Jiang &apos;s Air China flight touched down , departing colonial Governor Chris Patten was swept from Government House in a black Rolls Royce to the strains of &quot; Auld Lang Syne &quot; . 
Patten , 53 , choked back tears , and his wife and three daughters were red-eyed , as a police bugler played the Last Post and the Union Jack was lowered and wrapped up for him to take away . 
Beijing has promised to maintain freedoms in Hong Kong , and on Monday a Chinese army general offered soothing words for the territory while People &apos;s Liberation Army troops mustered at the border , ready to move in at dawn on Tuesday . 
in the final hours of British rule , Britain and China began patching up a row over democratic reforms introduced by Hong Kong &apos;s 28th and last governor , who Beijing has condemned as a &quot; whore &quot; , a &quot; sinner &quot; and a &quot; villain &quot; . 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair , joining a host of world figures gathered for handover pageantry , was mobbed at a glittering shopping arcade by Chinese crowds shouting , &quot; Tony , we love you &quot; . 
&quot; Mr Tung has made it quite clear that elections will be introduced and that is a step forward , &quot; he told reporters . 
he described the handover as &quot; difficult &quot; and &quot; momentous &quot; , and said : &quot; What is important is to look forward and to make sure Hong Kong becomes a bridge , not a barrier , between Britain and China . 
Tung , 60 , a billionaire whose Chinese name means &quot; build China &quot; , has promised popular elections for a new legislature next May . 
the democratically-elected Legislative Council will be replaced by a Beijing-picked Provisional Legislature just hours after midnight and several of the territory &apos;s most popular politicians will be out of a job . 
Blair said he was eager to build a strong and stable relationship with China -- but said Beijing must keep its freedom promises . 
&quot; What is absolutely essential is that there are two pillars , foundations of our relationship for the future . 
the first is adherence to the joint declaration , the agreement between Britain and China that guarantees the future prosperity and freedom of Hong Kong , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Second is our desire to build a strong and stable relationship with China for the future , which is both in the interests of the people of Hong Kong as well as the people of the United Kingdom . 
thousands of Chinese troops massed at the border before marching in to assert Beijing &apos;s sovereignty over a territory seized by Britain in the 19th century opium Wars . 
an advance party of 500 was arriving later on Monday to help prepare the way for a massive second wave of 4,000 , accompanied by armour , ships and helicopters , at break of the first day of Chinese rule . 
&quot; You must love the people of Hong Kong ... and with your actual deeds win the support and love of the Hong Kong people , &quot; China &apos;s top army officer , General Liu Huaqing , told the People &apos;s Liberation Army in Shenzhen , a few minutes from the colonial frontier . 
he reminded the soldiers that Hong Kong would enjoy autonomy under the unique &quot; one country , two systems &quot; formula designed to help the embrace of communist China and rampantly capitalist Hong Kong for the next 50 years . 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Monday expressed confidence that Hong Kong could maintain its place as a freewheeling economic powerhouse if China stuck to the terms of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration which settled the colony &apos;s fate . 
both ministers repeated concerns at the swift and blunt projection of Chinese military power . 
Hong Kong democrats still have nightmares over the PLA &apos;s crushing of democratic dissent in Beijing &apos;s Tiananmen Square in 1989 . 
veteran democrat Martin Lee told reporters on Monday it was not the timing of the garrisoning of Hong Kong that grated but the manner of it . 
&quot; It should be much more low key , instead of invading Hong Kong , &quot; he said . 
under pouring rain -- and with a stiff upper lip -- Britain staged a farewell ceremony to its last major outpost of empire on the Victoria Harbour waterfront .
