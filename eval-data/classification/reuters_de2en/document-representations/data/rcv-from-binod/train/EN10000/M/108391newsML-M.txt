Shortcovering by funds lifted CSCE world sugar futures from below unchanged to close just under session peaks , possibly setting the stage for higher prices Friday , dealers said . 
Most-active March contract climbed from a low of 10.69 cents a lb , where sell stops have been cited , to settle near the day &apos;s high of 10.89 cents . 
but firm resistance was cited at 10.94 , and prices are expected to remain within their current trading range amid a dearth of market-moving news . 
&quot; No on expects this market to come roaring back to 11.20 any time soon , &quot; a dealer said . 
he noted producer selling at each tick up and called today &apos;s move a short covering technical rally . 
but volume was strong at an estimated 19,228 lots . 
March ended 0.10 firmer at 10.88 , having ranged from 10.89 to 10.69 . 
the back months finished 0.11 to 0.05 higher . 
the March / May spread , which closed even Wednesday , settled at 0.04 . 
open interest in the March contract rose 385 lots to 85,678 lots . 
in fundamental news , Romania said 1996 sugar output , expected to exceed 280,000 tonnes , will fall short of demand , raising the likelihood for raw sugar imports . 
a floor source cited talk that Russia bought more than 100,000 tonnes of sugar , but market sources were unable to verify the rumor . 
&quot; I can &apos;t confirm it but it is possible , &quot; said Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes . 
she said prices are low enough to encourage buying but it is still early in the season for Russia to purchase sugar . 
&quot; The time of year makes me a little skeptical , &quot; she said .
