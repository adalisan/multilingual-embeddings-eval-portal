Hungary &apos;s inflation is likely to reverse an 18-month decline in the June-August period but will drop further in the longer term , boosting real wages and consumption , independent think-tank GKI said on Thursday . 
&quot; We see inflation rising in June , July and August , and to approach or reach 19 percent in August , &quot; GKI Chairman and CEO Andras Vertes told a conference of businessmen organised by the organisation Prosperity Group . 
year-on-year inflation ran at 17.7 percent in May , but it was likely to rise due mainly to an expected rise in the price of seasonal food and partly to July energy price rises , Vertes said . 
but from September or October the year-on-year index is forecast to fall again and go down to 18 percent by December , bringing average inflation to 18.5 percent , down from 23.6 percent in 1996 , he added . 
with these inflation levels and a projected 24 percent increase in net wages , real wages are likely to go up by about five percent this year , he said , adding that GKI saw household consumption rising by three percent restoring 1995 levels . 
mainly the market of durable goods will benefit from the recovery of household spending as their average price is likely to rise by only 10 percent this year due to reductions in customs duties in imports , Vertes said . 
GKI sees Hungary &apos;s gross domestic product ( GDP ) rising by three percent in 1997 and 4.5 percent in 1998 , while inflation would decline to average 14 percent by the end of 1998 . 
along with economic growth , the foreign trade deficit will probably rise to slightly above $ 3 billion this year from $ 2.7 billion in 1996 and the current account deficit to $ 2 billion from $ 1.7 billion , he said . 
however , a dynamic inflow of foreign direct investment will help the country to cut its net foreign debt by some $ 1 billion this year , Vertes said . 
Hungary &apos;s net foreign debt was $ 12.9 billion in 1996 . 
&quot; If this trend continues for two or three years , the economy will simply grow out of the problem of debt , &quot; Vertes said . 
GKI forecasts a heavy inflow of foreign investments continue and shares on the Budapest Stock Exchange to offer a real yield of 20 to 30 percent in dollar terms by the end of 1998 , Vertes said .
