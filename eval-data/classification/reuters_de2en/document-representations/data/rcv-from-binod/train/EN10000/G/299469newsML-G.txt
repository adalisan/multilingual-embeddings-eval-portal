Switzerland &apos;s biggest coalition party on Friday joined Jewish demands that the cabinet denounce Economics Minister Jean-Pascal Delamuraz , who described calls for Swiss restitution to Holocaust victims as blackmail . 
the Social Democrats , one of four parties in the centre-left coalition that has ruled since 1959 , said the Federal Council must distance itself from Delamuraz &apos;s remarks , made last month at he ended his one-year term in the rotating Swiss presidency . 
the cabinet refused to rebuke Delamuraz this week for the comments that outraged Israeli politicians and world Jewish groups , prompting them to renew threats of a boycott against Swiss banks . 
&quot; These comments are not only an unbearable insult to victims of the Holocaust . 
they also insult Switzerland and the Swiss people at the same time , &quot; the Social Democrats wrote in a statement from party headquarters . 
&quot; The Swiss Social Democrats therefore demand that the cabinet quickly and fully distance itself from the remarks of minister Delamuraz , &quot; it added . 
a prominent banker said any boycott would have serious consequences for Swiss financial institutions , who have denied Jewish allegations they are still sitting on billions of dollars in unclaimed funds and stonewalling victims &apos; relatives . 
&quot; Threats of a boycott are very uncomfortable for us . 
and if a boycott were to come about , de facto or de jure , then it would be serious , without a doubt , &quot; Swiss Bank Corp chief executive Marcel Ospel told the Finanz und Wirtschaft newspaper . 
the interview was released ahead of publication on Saturday . 
&quot; But in judging the situation , there are three reactions that give me reason for confidence , &quot; Ospel added , citing opposition to any boycott from the Swiss Jewish Federation , U.S. 
Berne politicians have said it would be extremely unusual for the cabinet to chastise Delamuraz considering Switzerland &apos;s political culture , which emphasises consensus over confrontation as a way of holding the multi-ethnic country together . 
it was also unlikely because of a perception in Berne that Delamuraz &apos;s views were shared by a lot of ordinary Swiss , many of whose letters to newspapers have scorned Jewish restitution efforts as a way of extorting money from wealthy Switzerland . 
groups led by the World Jewish Congress ( WJC ) say Swiss banks and government profited cynically from the Holocaust by sitting on accounts left ownerless by Jewish victims and by buying stolen gold from Nazi Germany during World War Two . 
while the Social Democrats &apos; intervention adds to pressure on the cabinet , the seven ministers -- two from the SP and the others from three conservative parties -- are basically autonomous and do not have to follow party appeals .
