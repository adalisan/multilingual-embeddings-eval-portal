Polish shares on Friday extended Thursday &apos;s fall and analysts saw more losses on Monday before the start of Bank Handlowy &apos;s large public offering and possible nervousness over the Czech currency crisis . 
the pricing of Handlowy &apos;s public offering , seen worth a total of $ 1 billion , is due later on Friday , while the zloty fell almost two percent on Thursday before easing on Friday . 
&quot; I think some domestic players sold shares thinking foreign investors would and that maybe the Czech situation where a falling ( currency ) leads to falling stocks could happen here , &quot; said Pawel Tarnowski of Raiffeisen Capital and Investment . 
the main market &apos;s all-share WIG index fell 1.6 percent to 16,179.0 points and turnover fell 11.5 percent to 140.3 million zlotys ( $ 43.8 million ) on all three markets . 
losers led gainers by 88 to five with eight stocks flat . 
analysts put support at 15,500 points . 
they said the session &apos;s biggest loser , builder Espebepe , fell 9.8 percent in profit taking on the back of this week &apos;s surge after creditors last Friday accepted the company &apos;s version of a debt-relief deal . 
selling of the stock after price fixing was strong enough for players to have their sell offers reduced .
