the following is a breakdown of the tax package to be debated by the lower house of Argentina &apos;s Congress Wednesday , after changes negotiated by the Chamber of Deputies and the Peronist government : 
* 46 percent increase in tax on diesel . 
* 12 percent increase in gasoline tax . 
* 28.6 percent rise in tax on natural gas . 
( the Deputies &apos; Budget Committee removed an article making fuel tax hikes non-shareable with provinces , leaving it to the Senate to vote on Economy Minister Roque Fernandez &apos;s request for this revenue to go exclusively to central government . 
* 10 percent tax increase on diesel vehicles . 
* increase in income tax for companies , to 33 percent from 30 percent , and for wage-earners on more than $ 10,000 a month , to 35 percent from 30 percent . 
* An increase in the share of personal wealth tax going to the provinces , to 56 percent from 10 percent . 
* authorization for a $ 4.0 billion increase in government indebtedness for this year . 
from the original tax package presented August 21 , with which Fernandez hoped to cut $ 1.6 billion off the budget gap , the deputies removed at the committee stage extensions of value added tax and a rise in women &apos;s retirement age to 65 from 60 . 
one proposal from Peronist deputies to double personal wealth tax to 1.0 percent was also dropped . 
it is still unclear whether the Deputies will include an article in Fernandez &apos;s original bill which reduces exporters &apos; reimbursements to 10 percent , with a 10 percent ceiling .
