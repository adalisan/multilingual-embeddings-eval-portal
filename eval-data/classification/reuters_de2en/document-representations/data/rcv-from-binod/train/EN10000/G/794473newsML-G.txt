wild forest fires blazed along Italy &apos;s picturesque Amalfi coast on Tuesday and police said they temporarily closed part of the winding cliffside road after flames caused rock falls . 
firefighters on land and in helicopters worked all morning to douse flames which broke out overnight in the forested hills above the coast leading to the popular seaside resort of Amalfi on the southwestern coast . 
the flames spread and toppled large rocks onto the highway , forcing police to close a 15-km ( nine-mile ) section between Amalfi and Salerno for two hours ahead of a busy long public holiday weekend when millions of people were expected to head for the sea . 
a spokesman for the fire service said the flames had been brought under control by early afternoon and the road re-opened . 
authorities said fires had broken out intermittently in the scenic Amalfi area in the last few days but had so far not caused significant damage . 
the thickly forested region is prone to fires during southern Italy &apos;s hot , dry summers .
