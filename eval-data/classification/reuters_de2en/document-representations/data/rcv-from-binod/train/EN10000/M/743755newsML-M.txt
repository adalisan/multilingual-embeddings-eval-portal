the Israeli shekel rose against the dollar on Monday for the fourth consecutive session in quiet trading as fears of an interest rate fall eased , dealers said . 
&quot; Activity was relatively low toady and the shekel continued to rise , &quot; said Zahi Elias at Bank Leumi . 
&quot; The strengthening of the shekel started last Wednesday following the higher-than-expected consumer price index ( CPI ) , &quot; he said . 
the June CPI , released last Tuesday , rose 1.1 percent , well above expectations , and has heightened fears of an interest rate hike later this month . 
&quot; One thing is clear . 
the central bank will not lower the rate on Thursday , &quot; Elias said . 
since the release of the CPI the shekel gained 1.2 percent against the U.S. currency . 
Olivier Hakoune at Union Bank said that the shekel is expected to test the 3.5 level . 
&quot; During the last few weeks the shekel was stuck between 3.5 to 3.6 shekels per dollar . 
it tried to break the 3.6 level but did not succeed . 
now the question is when will it try to break 3.5 . 
Hakoune added that on Monday the shekel found support at 3.515 shekels per dollar . 
Elias added that dollar buyers are sitting on the fence waiting to see where the market is going . 
&quot; Until recently the buyers were very active and the sellers were waiting , now it is exactly the opposite . 
the representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.5240 shekels compared with 3.5320 on Friday . 
the basket , composed of the dollar , mark , pound sterling , French franc and yen , was fixed at 3.7981 against 3.8066 on Friday . 
on the crosses , the shekel traded against the yen at 3.0424 shekels per 100 yen compared with 3.0540 on Friday , and against the mark at 1.9651 shekels compared with 1.9695 on Friday . 
in late afternoon , the dollar was trading at 3.5230 shekels .
