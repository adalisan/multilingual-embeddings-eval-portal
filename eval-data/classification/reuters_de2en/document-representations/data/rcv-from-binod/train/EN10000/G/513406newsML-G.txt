U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Wednesday gave the clearest sign yet that North Korea was on the verge of accepting a proposal that would launch landmark Korean peninsula peace talks . 
&quot; We expect that we in fact might have some good news about the North Koreans &apos; acceptance of four-party talks that deal with the Korean peninsula , &quot; she said in Grand Rapids , Michigan , where she gave a speech at the rededication of the President Gerald R. Ford Museum . 
her spokesman Nicholas Burns earlier in Washington had fuelled optimism that Pyongyang &apos;s Stalinist regime , struggling with a devastating famine threat , was about to enter peace talks with its archrival , the more prosperous democratic South . 
&quot; We &apos;re encouraged by the early progress that has been made , &quot; Burns said after delegations from the two Koreas and the United States held two hours of morning talks at a New York hotel . 
the teams broke for lunch , then resumed deliberations in the afternoon . 
burns said he expected statements from all three participants when talks end on Wednesday . 
another U.S. official said while this was the goal &quot; there &apos;s a chance that it won &apos;t &quot; happen until Friday . 
U.S. officials have been optimistic Pyongyang would respond positively to Washington &apos;s year-old joint proposal with South Korea for four-party peace talks that would finally close the books on the 1950-53 Korean War by replacing the fraying armistice with a peace treaty . 
China would also participate . 
&quot; We hope very much that as a result of these talks North Korea will decide to agree with the four-party proposal , &quot; Burns told reporters in Washington . 
he based his assessment on a telephone conversation with the chief U.S. negotiator , Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Charles Kartman , during the lunch break . 
&quot; The talks are ... going well . 
we &apos;re certainly encouraged by the first few hours of the talks and we hope very much for a positive result from these discussions , &quot; Burns said . 
North Korea was upbeat as the meeting began . 
&quot; I think we will come out with good results , &quot; Kim Gye Gwan , Pyongyang &apos;s delegation chief , told his South Korean counterpart during a picture-taking session with journalists . 
Seoul &apos;s chief negotiator , Song Young Shik , was also in a jovial mood , laughing , engaging in chit-chat with Kim and talking about how he hoped the meeting would reflect the warm spring day that enveloped New York . 
North and South Korean delegation leaders , smiling broadly , joined in a three-way handshake with Kartman . 
asked by reporters how he thought the meeting would go , Song held up his crossed fingers , a sign of his hopefulness . 
South Korean officials said the morning session involved Pyongyang making a &quot; presentation . 
it was thought North Korea might make a final pitch for more food aid to compensate for two years of shortages due to flooding that the United States , as well as humanitarian groups , agreed are devastating and worsening . 
if Pyongyang agreed , the landmark peace talks would not begin until June or July . 
the goal was to defuse tensions on the heavily armed and volatile divided Korean peninsula . 
on the eve of the meeting , Washington announced $ 15 million in additional food aid to feed children in North Korea . 
it said the new donation , bringing total U.S. food aid to Pyongyang to $ 33.4 million since late 1995 , was made because the North &apos;s food shortages would reach a critical stage this spring . 
the new aid came on top of $ 10 million pledged by Washington in February and responded to a U.N. World Food programme appeal for $ 95.5 million .
