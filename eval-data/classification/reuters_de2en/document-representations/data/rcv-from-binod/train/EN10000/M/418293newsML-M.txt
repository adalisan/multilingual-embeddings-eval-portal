Dutch shares climbed sharply on Tuesday to close at a record high , boosted by the continuing surge in the dollar , a fresh spate of encouraging Dutch company results and positive comments from Fed chairman Alan Greenspan on sustainable low-inflation U.S. growth . 
&quot; The dollar is very strong again today and therefore this market is doing extremely well , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; Volume hasn &apos;t been that high ... it &apos;s more a question that people don &apos;t want to sell when they think the market has higher to go . 
the AEX closed 17.14 points , or 2.33 percent , up at a record 753.40 , beating the previous 750.51 peak set on February 26 . 
&quot; On top of the dollar rise we &apos;ve had good results today from Hunter Douglas and Stork , &quot; he said , adding hopes were high that companies yet to report this week -- such as Ahold -- would continue the stream of good corporate news . 
dealers said the market could well be set to push back above the 755.73 AEX intra-day high , also reached on February 26 . 
&quot; The old high is very much within reach , &quot; said another dealer . 
&quot; With the market at these levels we &apos;re reaching a point when the options traders are beginning to buy in the cash market because they &apos;re betting on a lower AEX , &quot; he said . 
&quot; If they leave it much longer they are going to get squeezed harder . 
some dealers sounded a warning against the speed of the AEX &apos;s advance which has seen over a dozen records fall during its 100-point plus rise from 648 since the end of last year . 
&quot; When you look at sentiment in this market it &apos;s extremely strong , but when you look at the valuation it &apos;s too high , &quot; said one dealer , adding that bullish sentiment could still prove stronger than a cold evaluation of underlying worth . 
&quot; My feeling is that sentiment is going to win out . 
we &apos;re going to see a new high in the short term , &quot; he said . 
chart analysts are split on this week &apos;s direction in the AEX although most pencil in heavy resistance at the old high .
