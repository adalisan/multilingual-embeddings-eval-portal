the latest opinion poll in France &apos;s parliamentary election campaign , published on Monday , gave the centre-right coalition a narrow majority of seats and found more than one-third of voters could change their minds . 
the BVA poll for France 2 television and Europe 1 radio said that if the May 25-June 1 election were held now , the ruling RPR-UDF coalition would win 296 of the 555 seats in metropolitan France , the Socialists 238 , the Communists 18 , the ecologists two and the extreme-right National Front one . 
the poll , taken on Friday , Saturday and Sunday with a sample of 1,030 registered voters , gave the following voting intentions on the first round : UDF-RPR 39 percent , Socialist party and other left 28 percent , National Front 14 percent , Communists 10 percent , ecologists seven percent and extreme left two percent . 
seventeen percent of those who said they were certain to vote did not express a voting intention . 
of those who did , 38 percent said they could still change their minds . 
BVA said its first projection since President Jacques Chirac dissolved parliament last Monday showed that the race was still wide open . 
a single percentage point variation in voting intention for the major parties or the National Front could radically change the outcome , it said .
