Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy met Turkey &apos;s main opposition leader Mesut Yilmaz on Wednesday , the second day of a trip to Moslem but secular Turkey , Anatolian news agency said . 
it said Levy had breakfast with motherland Party ( ANAP ) head Yilmaz at a five-star hotel in the capital . 
levy was due to fly to Istanbul for talks with Turkish business leaders later in the day . 
Turkey &apos;s Islamist prime minister , Necmettin Erbakan , told Levy frankly on Tuesday that improved relations depended on Israel giving up its claim to the whole of Jerusalem and handing occupied land over to the Palestinians . 
&quot; It is natural , as with all other countries , that developing our relations with Israel is part of our programme , &quot; he told reporters with Levy sitting by his side . 
&quot; In this connection , Israel also has large responsibilities . 
... Above all it must always recognise that Jerusalem is a sacred city for all peoples ... for Moslems as well as for Christians and Jews , &quot; Erbakan said . 
he said Israel must also halt construction of new Jewish settlements in and around Jerusalem and withdraw from the occupied lands , in line with U.N. resolutions . 
Israel says Jerusalem is its eternal and united capital . 
levy struck a more optimistic note than Erbakan . 
&quot; Another step has been taken in relations between the two countries , &quot; he said . 
levy made clear he hoped to smooth relations with Erbakan and his Islam-based Welfare Party in a bid for political ties more in line with the warm military relations and growing commercial links the two countries already enjoy .
