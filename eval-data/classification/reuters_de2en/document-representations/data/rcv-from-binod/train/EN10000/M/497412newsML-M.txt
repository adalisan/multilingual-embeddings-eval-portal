trading on the Colombo Stock Exchange ( CSE ) will become fully automated next month , a senior exchange official said on Wednesday . 
&quot; We hope to have fully screen-based trading in May which will make us a fully automated stock exchange , &quot; Isuru Tillakawardana , assistant general manager of the exchange told Reuters . 
brokers will initially trade through computer terminals on the floor and an electronic data wall will display market information . 
&quot; Within three to four months floor trading will cease to exist on a regular basis , and only be used as a back up if there is a wide area network failure , &quot; Lalin Paranavitana , Manager of Data Processing said . 
back office settlement operations were automated earlier by putting in place a central depository system .
