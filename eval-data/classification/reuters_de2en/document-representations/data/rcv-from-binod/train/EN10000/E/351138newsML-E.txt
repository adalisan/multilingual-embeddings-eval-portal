the Philippine Senate approved on Monday the 1997 national budget of 433.8 billion pesos after a compromise was reached last week to break a month-long impasse . 
the House of Representatives approved the same measure last week after both houses agreed to cut their countrywide development fund entitlements which are used to fund projects in their constituencies . 
last December , the opposition-dominated Senate cut the House-approved budget of 474.9 billion pesos by about 82.6 billion pesos because it feared the administration-backed Lower House may use the funds for early campaigning ahead of the 1998 presidential and congressional elections .
