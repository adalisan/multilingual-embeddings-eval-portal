NATO will not offer Russia a formal treaty governing cooperation between the alliance and Moscow , NATO general secretary Javier Solana was quoted as saying on Wednesday . 
in an interview with Germany &apos;s Die Zeit weekly newspaper , Solana said he was also opposed to Russia joining NATO . 
&quot; The NATO alliance does not believe a treaty would be the best way to solve the problems that have to be resolved , &quot; Solana said , according to an advance text of the interview released on Wednesday . 
asked about Russia joining NATO , Solana said : &quot; It is not yet the right time for that . 
Solana said he hoped that NATO could reach an agreement with Moscow on NATO &apos;s enlargement plans before its summit in July in Madrid . 
but he said the world would not come to an end if an agreement were not achieved . 
&quot; We would like to reach an agreement that would put relations between NATO and Russia on a lasting foundation , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Russia should understand that we will do our best . 
but if an agreement can &apos;t be reached in time , we will postpone it and have to adapt to that .
