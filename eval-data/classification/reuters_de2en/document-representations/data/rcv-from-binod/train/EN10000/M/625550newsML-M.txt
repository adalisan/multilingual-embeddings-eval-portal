wall Street stocks stood modestly lower in late afternoon on Friday , holding to tight ranges after recouping the majority of their early-session losses . 
the Dow industrials were off about 14 points at 7316 and the Nasdaq composite was down 10 points at 1393 . 
volatility and volume both appeared to dwindle in the late stages of the session , although some analysts thought stocks might encounter at least one more wave of selling after Intel Corp &apos;s early morning warning regarding its second quarter results . 
&quot; It wouldn &apos;t surprise me to see a little more sloppy activity , &quot; said Greg NIE , technical analyst at EVEREN Securities . 
&quot; I &apos;m somewhat skeptical that all the nervous selling has been taken care of .
