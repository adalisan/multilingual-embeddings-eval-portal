one of the big problems about being all things to all men is that some men ( and women ) occasionally get fractious about you being friends with anybody else . 
&quot; Being friends with &quot; one party or another is often inferred to mean there is hostility towards a third party , fallaciously on the mistaken grounds that &quot; My enemy &apos;s enemy must be my friend , and my enemy &apos;s friend must be my enemy . 
such is the problem now confronting the South African government in its foreign relations with the two Chinas . 
South Africa would like to have diplomatic relations with both Beijing and Taipei . 
Taipei and Pretoria already have formal diplomatic links - in fact , it is often said that South Africa is the single most important country which formally recognises Taiwan . 
this strips the usual inscrutable facade from the diplomatic mandarins in Beijing , who will not tolerate diplomatic links between any of the PRC &apos;s formal friends and Taipei . 
South Africa &apos;s foreign policy , such as it is , is to be on the best possible relations with as many countries as will accept its friendship . 
this has caused some nervousness , even in the corridors of power in Washington , when friends which Pretoria currently wishes to keep include the likes of Cuba , Libya and Iran . 
what makes the two Chinas situation even more unique in South Africa &apos;s experience is the fact that both of them seem quite happy to sit down and make economically tangible bids for Pretoria &apos;s recognition . 
Five-hundred factories plus senior and middle management personnel , to be located near Potchefstroom in the southern section of the mineral rich ( but not much else ) North West province was the opening bid from the PRC . 
the Taiwanese have put a petro-chemical plant on the table , and now South Africa &apos;s policy-makers have to make their choice ... or do they ? 
although it is neither the birthplace , nor the craddle of a modern democratic free-enterprise economy , Taiwan does retain some strong elements of an economy that is not centrally controlled . 
the Taiwanese government can do what it likes , but it cannot guarantee that its private sector will put up $ 750 million in plant and equipment in South Africa without any prospects of a commercial return . 
the PRC can , its government heading up not only a largely centrally controlled economy , but one which is the largest in the world when compared to other giants by means of purchasing power parity , rather than the conventional market dollar approach . 
not surprisingly , then , that the opening bid from the PRC is somewhat fatter in monetary value than that of Taiwan . 
but , while the economic bait has certainly been cast , neither side has been scandalous enough to point to either its own or the other side &apos;s offer as being anything more than possible plans which would need to be firmed up in the future . 
it has been noticeable that ever since the PRC Potch project was suggested , Taiwanese businessman have quietly been carrying on behaving fairly typically as could be expected in the early stages of such a project . 
to all intents and purposes , the Taiwanese are behaving as if this was a normal business deal , totally independent of any developments on the diplomatic level . 
who knows , it might just be that . 
it has been pointed out by analysts that , once Hong Kong is re-incorporated into mainland China , the level of South African trade with each of the two Chinas will be in the same order of magnitude . 
one of the major requirements for the South African government &apos;s growth plan is a rise in the rate of non-mineral exports at 10 percent per annum in real terms . 
South Africans should not imagine that the PRC is a king-size backward country eagerly waiting to buy overpriced manufactured goods . 
after all , the country is a nuclear power . 
policy-makers in South Africa would also want to look at both sides of the coin concerning both the pieces of diplomatic bait , if that is what the petro-chemical plant and factories turn out to be . 
if they are intended to manufacture for the South African market ( the petrochemical plant seems less likely to be inwardly orientated than the 500 factories ) , they could end up being more of a problem than they are worth . 
perhaps the best thing for decision makers in South African political circles to do would be to dust off their copies of Machiavelli to inspire their ability to do the truly diplomatic thing , which is to play both ends against each other , without getting caught in the middle . 
why not ? 
economic diplomacy is certainly not over-endowed with altruism . 
once again , who can tell for certain that there is not an iron fist within the silken glove ?
