Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel said in remarks published on Thursday he was troubled by what he called a growing fanaticism in Israel and throughout the world . 
Wiesel , a human rights activist and survivor of two World War Two Nazi concentration camps , said the trend went beyond the 1995 murder of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by a religious Jew and the 1994 massacre of 29 Arabs by a Jewish settler . 
&quot; I am very troubled by the fanaticism which is growing throughout the world and here as well , &quot; he told the Haaretz newspaper in an interview . 
&quot; I &apos;m not just talking about Yigal Amir and Baruch Goldstein who represent the murderous trend of fanaticism . 
you feel it in the language as well , &quot; Wiesel said , referring to Rabin &apos;s killer and the gunman who carried out the Hebron mosque massacre . 
he said he was shocked this week when ultra-religious Jews , protesting against the opening of a street in their Jerusalem neighbourhood on the Sabbath , threw stones at police standing at attention during a memorial siren for Israel &apos;s war dead . 
&quot; You really have to lose all humane sensitivity and respect to do something like that , &quot; Wiesel said .
