Madagascar at the weekend marked the 50th anniversary of the 1947 rising against French colonisation in which more than 90,000 died . 
the anniversary was marked throughout the Indian Ocean island republic . 
in Antananarivo , President Didier Ratsiraka led the ceremonies on Saturday at the national mausoleum . 
the ceremony had special significance at Moramanga , a small town 110 km ( 70 miles ) west of Antananarivo , where the rebellion started in March 1947 . 
about 4,000 survivors of the revolt attended . 
researchers are pressing France to open up its archives on the 1947 rising , which have so far remained secret . 
France established a protectorate in Madagascar in 1885 , and the island became a French colony in 1896 . 
it became an independent republic in June 1960 .
