Irish bond prices were marked up in moderate trade on Thursday but slipped back slightly later in the session as nerves crept into the market . 
&quot; We &apos;ve seen a very bullish performance in Irish bonds today , &quot; a dealer said . 
but traders said talk of a strong British M4 money supply figure , due for release on Friday , and a stronger than expected Philadelphia Federal Reserve survey , dragged the market back off highs later in the day . 
Irish yields to German Bunds narrowed to 143 basis points over in the five-year bond and to 87 basis points over in the 10 year . 
&quot; The Irish market has outperformed Germany today by about three basis points in the 10 year and about five basis points in the short end , &quot; a dealer said . 
traders said the short end was supported by the punt &apos;s slight weakening against the mark , which had the effect of pushing down money market rates . 
dealers also reported foreign interest early in the session , which pushed prices up . 
Irish pound revaluation rumours continue to keep investors interested in the Irish market , they added .
