defence Minister Turhan Tayan said on Thursday that Turkey would use all possible means to halt the planned deployment in Cyprus of Russian anti-aircraft missiles . 
&quot; We are strongly against these missiles going to the island . 
we will use all our capabilities to prevent it , &quot; Anatolian news agency quoted Tayan as saying . 
&quot; They will be used when the time is right in the necessary manner and proportion , &quot; the agency quoted him as saying while visiting an aviation factory . 
Turkey has accused the Cypriot government of trying to change the balance of forces on the divided island with a deal announced last weekend to buy the Russian S-300 missiles that could neutralise Turkish air superiority . 
the Cypriot government says the rockets are defensive . 
&quot; Defence minister Tayan gave the example of the U.S. &apos; blockade &apos; on Cuba when Russia tried to found bases there in the past , &quot; Anatolian said in an apparent reference to the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 . 
&quot; Those who play with fire have to take the responsibilities for their actions , &quot; Tayan said . 
Cyprus earlier dismissed a warning on Wednesday by Tayan that Turkey could attack the island if it needed to protect the Turkish Cypriot community in the north of the island . 
&quot; These threats from Turkey are nothing new , &quot; said government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides . 
&quot; We have heard such threats before . 
Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 in response to a Greek Cypriot coup inspired by the military then ruling Athens . 
around 30,000 troops are based in north Cyprus , declared a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in 1983 and recognised only by Ankara . 
the Greek Cypriot administration in the south is internationally recognised as the island &apos;s only government . 
the United States is to send an envoy to the island at the weekend to try to reduce tensions between Greeks and Turks . 
Washington has criticised Cyprus , saying the missile purchase would introduce a destabilising new military element and complicate peace moves . 
Britain &apos;s deputy high commissioner to Cyprus expressed his concern at a meeting with the foreign minister on Thursday , a British spokesman said .
