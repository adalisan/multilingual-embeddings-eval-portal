the Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) on Thursday forecast the Thai economy would continue to slow in the next few years but said the country &apos;s economic fundamentals were sound . 
Thailand &apos;s gross domestic product ( GDP ) was projected to expand by an average of 6.3 percent in 1997 and 1998 against 6.7 percent growth last year and 8.7 percent in 1995 , the Manila-based ADB said in its annual report . 
the report said it expected the battered Thai manufacturing sector , weakened by stagnating exports and rising labour costs , to recover from mid-1997 . 
&quot; In comparison with the recent past , the performance of the Thai economy will remain moderate in the coming years ... ( but ) although the pace of growth is slowing , economic fundamentals are widely perceived to be sound , &quot; it said . 
&quot; To revive export expansion , it will be necessary to shift industrial production from resource-based , labour-intensive activities ... to high value-added activities which can absorb higher wages ... &quot; 
the ADB said exports , which registered zero growth in 1996 , should rise 4.5 percent this year and eight percent in 1998 on expectations of stronger world demand . 
it said with tight monetary and fiscal policy , Thailand would likely manage to cool inflation to about five percent in 1997 and 4.8 percent in 1998 from 5.9 percent last year . 
the ADB report said the country &apos;s current account deficit would also ease to about 7.3 percent of gross national product in both 1997 and 1998 against about 8.1 percent in 1996 . 
the bank said sharp hikes in Thai wages during an economic boom between 1987 and 1995 were to blame for Thailand &apos;s difficulty now with adjusting to the economic slowdown 
&quot; Wage hikes in recent years have taken minimum wages in Thailand to at least four to five times higher than those of its regional competitors -- China , Indonesia and Vietnam . 
it said Thailand &apos;s total external debt nearly doubled over a four-year period to $ 68 billion in 1995 from $ 36 billion in 1991 , a large portion of which was contributed by the private sector . 
the Bank of Thailand , or central bank , has said total foreign debt rose to over $ 90 billion by early 1997 .
