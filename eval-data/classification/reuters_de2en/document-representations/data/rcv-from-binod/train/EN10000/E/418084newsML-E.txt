new York Gov. 
George Pataki said Tuesday a pact to extend a 12.5 percent surcharge on New York City &apos;s personal income tax has yet to be finalized because the Assembly has at least one objection . 
&quot; We have an agreement on the language of legislation . 
there is a question that the Assembly has about the Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU ) , which the city would sign , so that the legislation is ready to go if the MOU can be agreed upon , &quot; Pataki told reporters in Albany at a news conference . 
the governor did not elaborate about the issues raised by the Assembly , which he called minor , and predicted the measure , which the legislature failed to agree on last December , would be approved . 
I don &apos;t know if they can be resolved today , but it &apos;s possible , &quot; he added . 
spokesmen for the Assembly Speaker and the New York City mayor were not immediately available to comment . 
however , a city source , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said that the Assembly , which sought a commitment on how the April police class would be deployed and had wished to impose some reporting requiements , had reached an understanding with the Giuliani Administration . 
&quot; That was it . 
it was resolved , &quot; said the city source . 
the New York City Council has approved a bill to extend the surcharge , which expired at year-end , but Albany also must enact a matching bill . 
city officials have estimated the tax would produce $ 406 million during fiscal 1998 .
