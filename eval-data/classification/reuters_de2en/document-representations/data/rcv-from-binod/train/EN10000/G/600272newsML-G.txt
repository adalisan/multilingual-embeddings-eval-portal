Taiwan &apos;s foreign ministry confirmed on Tuesday foreign minister John Chang quietly left Taiwan late on Monday on a trip abroad . 
&quot; Minister Chang is out of the country . 
we will give more details of his visit in a few days , &quot; Chang &apos;s office told Reuters by telephone . 
the office declined to confirm media reports that Chang was on his way to Europe . 
Chang &apos;s visit is sure to trigger angry protest from Taiwan &apos;s arch rival , China , which has viewed the island as a renegade province since a civil war split them in 1949 . 
the trip came just one day after the island severed ties with the Bahamas after learning the Caribbean nation was preparing to secure ties with Beijing . 
the China Times said Chang likely will visit Brussels first and then other European countries during a visit that will last more than 10 days . 
the United Daily News said Chang might also visit unidentified African nations . 
now that ties with the Bahamas have been severed , Taiwan has diplomatic links with only 30 states , most of them small , poor and heavily dependent on Taipei &apos;s financial largesse . 
the number soon will fall to 29 , as top ally South Africa has said it would switch ties in 1997 .
