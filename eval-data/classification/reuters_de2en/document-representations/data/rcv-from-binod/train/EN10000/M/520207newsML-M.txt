milling wheat and maize future prices continued to surge on the Budapest commodity Exchange ( BCE ) on Friday , powered by rises on international markets and uncertainties over bad weather , traders said . 
&quot; The milling wheat followed international prices , &quot; said Robert Vajo of Termin broker . 
&quot; International markets are rising due to crop uncertainties caused by the changeable spring weather , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The weather is also too dry in Hungary . 
all the milling wheat futures traded on Friday rose by at least the 400 forint daily limit . 
the market focused on October and December milling wheat futures , which were allowed by trading rules to rise freely after three days of limit-up increase . 
the two maturities , which both gained 1,300 forints , accounted for 930 contracts out of the total 1,376 traded on the BCE on Friday . 
October milling wheat finished at 26,000 forints , while the December maturity ended at 27,000 . 
traders said the bullish sentiment in milling wheat futures trading &quot; infected &quot; the maize futures market , which was also affected by the dry and cold weather which was not favourable for sowing . 
&quot; Still there are surplus maize stocks ( in Hungary ) , &quot; Vajo said . 
&quot; But how large the sowing area and the yields will be this year , that is still uncertain . 
may maize finished at 19,300 forints , up 250 , while July rose the 400 forint limit , closing at 18,800 forints . 
traders said Hungarian grains prices were likely to continue to follow international markets , where they expected high volatility in the next few weeks due to changing weather conditions and yield forecasts .
