the International Spice Group plans to launch a pepper futures exchange , the first of its kind for spices , to better control the global pepper market , an official of the group said on Tuesday . 
the exchange , to be set up in January in Cochin in southern India , will help hedge options for traders of pepper , the most widely used spice , said Fazli Husain , senior commodity marketing officer of the U.N.-backed International Trade Centre . 
Husain , an advisor for the Spice Group , told Reuters that the new exchange would make the international pepper market less volatile . 
Husain said black pepper , which amounts to about 30 percent of all spices traded in the world , determines the value of the global spice market , which was around $ 2 billion last year . 
&quot; In the early part of this decade when the price of pepper was low , the spice market was less than $ 1.5 billion . 
the market is at today &apos;s high levels because of high pepper prices , &quot; he said . 
India is the world &apos;s biggest spice exporter , having sold one quarter of the 450,000 tonnes of spices sold in the international market last year , he said . 
Husain is among some 40 overseas delegates from 20 countries who are taking part in a symposium in Colombo this week to work out ways to boost spice exports . 
the group , set up in the late 1970s and supported by the Commonwealth Secretariat and the International Trade Centre , plans to assist spice producing countries to achieve sustainable growth as its priority , officials said . 
with the exception of Brazil , the most important spice producing nations are in Asia , with India , Indonesia , Malaysia , Thailand and Vietnam being the most prolific producers and exporters . 
the United States , the world &apos;s largest market for spices , imported 262,743 tonnes worth $ 445.3 million in 1995 . 
European Union countries jointly imported 195,801 tonnes worth $ 444.4 million last year , spice officals said . 
Husain said the main concern for the importing countries was the commodities &apos; quality . 
&quot; Not one exporting country can claim at this stage they are giving a clean and quality product , &quot; he said . 
a majority of complaints were regarding pesticide residue in spices , arising from a developing countries &apos; farming practice of using too much pesticide to maximise production , he said . 
&quot; We &apos;re imparting knowledge on using quality control from start to finish . 
to get producers to use less pesticide , to start using cleaning machines and to lab-test samples . 
he said producers had to pay attention to these factors if they wanted to carve a bigger slice of a growing spice market . 
&quot; It is a growth market , &quot; Husain said . 
&quot; For as long as people continue to appreciate food , there will be a growing demand for spices . 
among the principal spices traded globally today are pepper , paprika , cinnamon , cloves , ginger , tumeric and nutmeg .
