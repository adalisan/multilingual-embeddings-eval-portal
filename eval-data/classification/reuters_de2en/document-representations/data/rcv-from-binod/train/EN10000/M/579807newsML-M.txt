Indian call money ended Tuesday at 8.0 percent , off the day &apos;s high of 8.5 percent and dealers said they expected rates to ease further in the coming days . 
they said call money was likely to ease on inflows into the banking system through interest payments on government securities and redemption of maturing stocks . 
&quot; Over the next two weeks , we should see around 10-15 billion rupees coming into the system from interest payments and redemptions , &quot; said a dealer at a state-run bank . 
&quot; The notified amounts at recent treasury bill auctions has come down from 5.0 billion rupees at the March 14 auction , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Each auction thereafter has been for less than 5.0 billion . 
so each week we should see some net inflow into banks from the bills which fall due for payment , &quot; the dealer said . 
dealers said prices of government securities were largely steady in moderate trade , with some stocks losing towards close . 
they said market attention was focussed in stocks with maturities up to 2002 . 
&quot; Towards the close of the day some primary dealers offloaded the 12.69 percent 2002 stock and it fell to 100.16 rupees from 100.25 yesterday , &quot; said a dealer . 
&quot; This also affected other stocks and the 13.50 percent 1997 stock fell to 101.88 from 101.92 earlier in the day and 101.95 yesterday , &quot; he said . 
among other active stocks , the 13.40 percent 1999 traded at 104.50 rupees against Monday &apos;s 104.49 , the 13.80 percent 2002 rose to 105.65 from 105.60 while the 13.85 percemt 2001 rose to 104.85 from 104.70 .
