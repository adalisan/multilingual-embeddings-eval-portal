Colombia &apos;s peso closed 1.10 higher at 994.15 in active trading on the country &apos;s interbank market . 
dealers said the peso slipped to an intraday low of 995.90 in early trade on solid demand for dollars from importers and small businesses seeking to make payments abroad . 
but banks sold dollars later in the day on speculation that the peso will trend upward next week , pushing the peso back up to a session high of 993.30 . 
dealers reported 378 trades for a total of $ 164.9 million .
