following is a selection of reactions to UK data showing January output prices up 0.2 % m / m and 1.5 % y / y , input prices down s / a 0.5 % m / m and down 6.2 % y / y : 
&quot; I &apos;m sure Kenneth Clarke is singing in his bath on these numbers , very good indeed . 
across the board these are very impressive figures and they indicate that inflation pressures coming through from the factory-gate side of the economy are extrarodinarily modest at the moment . 
&quot; A 0.2 percent increase in output prices , for this time of year given list price increases and so on , is very low and the annual rate reflects that . 
input prices also better than we anticipated . 
&quot; It &apos;s very hard to find anything negative to say about these data . 
they continue to show a very good story -- falling input prices , 30-year low or whatever it was on output prices . 
there can be no excuse for retailers to raise prices on these sort of figures . 
also , of course , we are seeing the beneficial effect of sterling . 
that will be holding down retail price inflation directly as well through competition from imported goods . 
so it &apos;s a very good inflation story . 
&quot; The UK PPIs give more power to the Chancellor &apos;s elbow and clearly support his decision not to tighten last week . 
the ongoing weakness of core factory gate prices not only bodes well for the RPI &apos;s medium-term profile but -- to the extent that the 0.1 PCT January fall probably reflects strong competitiveness factors -- it also boosts chances of a soft RPIX on Thursday . 
Clarke will feel more than able to take on all comers -- Bank of England or Treasury -- calling for higher rates after these data . 
should be very well received by short sterling and gilts and should do little harm to the pound ... &quot; 
&quot; ... with few in the market now expecting a pre-election tightening . 
one word of warning , however -- the big risk to UK inflation is the labour market and wages . 
non-labour costs are clearly not an issue at the moment , but risks are high that the rapid pace at which unemployment is falling forces up wages . 
if this happens , it will be virtually impossible to keep inflation in check without a rate hike . 
this makes Wednesday &apos;s labour market report almost more important than the RPIs themselves .
