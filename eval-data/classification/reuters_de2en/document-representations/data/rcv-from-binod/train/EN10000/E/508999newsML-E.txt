Bulgaria &apos;s consumer price inflation accelerated to 2,040.5 percent in March year on year from 1,839 percent in February and from 26.4 percent in March 1996 , a National Statistics Institute ( NSI ) official said . 
yr / yr PCT change + 2,040.5 + 1,839.0 + 26.4 
mth / mth PCT change + 12.3 + 242.7 + 1.7 
cumulative since Jan 1 + 452.3 + 391.9 + 6.0 
&quot; Year on year inflation was 2,040.5 percent for March . 
it could have accelerated much faster if month on month inflation has not slowed down considerably mainly due to the Lev rise , &quot; the NSI official said . 
month on month inflation slowed to 12.3 percent in March from 242.7 percent in February as the caretaker cabinet , in office for two months now , has stabilised the Lev from 2,900-2,800 per dollar in mid-February to around 1,800-1,600 in March . 
the Lev traded near 1,500 per dollar on Tuesday on the domestic interbank market . 
the NSI official said month on month inflation was expected to slow down further in April as food prices , which have the largest weight in the CPI calculation have been declining . 
&quot; Prices of the 32 most traded foods fell about 2.4 percent in the first 10 days of April under preliminary estimates and they are expected to fall further or at least stabilise near the current levels this month , &quot; said the official . 
economists envisage a long-term stabilisation of the financial system once the new government and parliament are formed after April 19 elections and foreign funding starts flowing in . 
Bulgaria has agreed nearly $ 1.2 billion of credits with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the World Bank , the European Union and the G24 industrialised nations . 
under a memorandum of economic policies agreed with the IMF , annual inflation for this year was assumed at 769 percent and at 14 percent for next year . 
with the projected stabilisation of the Lev / dollar exchange rate and the adoption of a restrictive fixed exchange rate mechanism inflation was expected to decline to monthly rates below two percent by year-end , the memorandum said . 
under a $ 657 million credit package approved by the IMF board last week Bulgaria is to introduce the mechanism , called a currency board system , in June to restore confidence in its economy . 
the system would require levs in circulation to be matched by central bank foreign exchange reserves , severely curbing the financial powers of the government and the central bank and preventing the printing of money .
