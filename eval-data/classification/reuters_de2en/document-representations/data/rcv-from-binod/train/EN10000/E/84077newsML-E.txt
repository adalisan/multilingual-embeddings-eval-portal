Canada &apos;s Finance Minister Paul Martin on Sunday delivered an upbeat assessment of the prospects for the Canadian economy next year . 
Martin said Canada &apos;s economic recovery was solid , but it was too soon to cut taxes . 
&quot; The outlook for 1997 and beyond is bright , &apos; he told the International Monetary Fund &apos;s policy-making Interim Committee . 
&quot; Our progress toward deficit reduction and in keeping inflation low has translated into sharply lower interest rates . 
the IMF has forecast that Canada &apos;s economic growth will pick up to 3.2 percent next year from 1.4 percent in 1996 . 
&quot; Putting Canada &apos;s finances on a sound footing is the cornerstone of our approach , &quot; Martin said . 
&quot; Deficit reduction is not a priority only of the federal government , &quot; he added . 
&quot; Seven of Canada &apos;s 10 provincial governments achieved balanced budgets or surpluses in the most recent fiscal year . 
while some analysts have voiced concern that cutting budget deficits when growth is weak is counter-productive , Martin said many nations do not have the luxury of postponing those decisions because their finances are in such bad shape . 
&quot; Economic recovery is firmly anchored . 
there is no doubt that lower interest rates are the main reason , &quot; Martin told reporters during the IMF / World Bank annual meetings . 
Martin noted that the housing and manufacturing sectors had improved considerably along with competitiveness . 
&quot; But now is not the time for broad-based tax cuts , &quot; he added .
