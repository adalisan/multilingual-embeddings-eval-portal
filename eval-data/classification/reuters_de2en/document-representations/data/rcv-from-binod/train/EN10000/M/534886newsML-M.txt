wheat prices turned volatile on Thursday , diving on rain forecasts in Europe and the U.S. but rebounding on news the European Union was putting a brake on exports by imposing taxes . 
copper prices spiked higher in London amid falling stocks , a supply squeeze and labour unrest , but came off the day &apos;s highs in the afternoon . 
elsewhere in commodity markets , coffee prices staggered lower after firming slightly in early London trade , while cocoa strengthened within a fairly tight range . 
oil markets were steady and largely rangebound . 
wheat prices slipped on forecasts for rainfall in portions of England &apos;s and France &apos;s wheat region after a prolonged dry spell in much of Europe and outlooks for cool and wet weather in the U.S. Great Plains . 
but they bounced back when the EU announced it was slapping export taxes on soft wheat grain and flour . 
Chicago Board of Trade wheat futures for May slid to $ 4.20 a bushel but around midday local time were at $ 4.34 , up 1-3 / 4 cents . 
prices had surged last week as dry conditions in Europe and floods and freezing weather condition in some areas of the United States sparked supply fears . 
copper prices finished the day firm , though off the day &apos;s highs , on the London Metal Exchange . 
nearly a year after the Sumitomo copper scandal sent shockwaves through the metals markets prices continue to soar despite predictions of a supply surplus this year . 
large players such as U.S investment banks or European merchants are said to be keeping a tight grip on the market in an operation linked to leftover positions from Sumitomo &apos;s fallen star trader Yasuo Hamanaka . 
&quot; This is a technically based squeeze , &quot; said analyst Angus Macmillan of broker Billiton . 
&quot; It &apos;s the aftershocks of the Hamanaka earthquake to some extent that are still being felt in the market . 
labour unrest also served to underline near-term supply concerns , after a small group of workers voted on Wednesday to continue with a strike at Chile &apos;s Escondida copper mine , the world &apos;s largest . 
meanwhile the management of Phelps dodge mine in the United States gave a final wage offer to miners who have been working without a contract for 10 months and workers at Cominco Ltd &apos;s Quebrada Blanca copper mine in Chile were set to reject a pay offer this weekend . 
copper for three months delivery ended barely changed at $ 2,268 per tonne , having failed to break above $ 2,400 earlier in the day . 
coffee prices were mostly weaker after a healthy start in thin volume in both London and New York . 
news the government in Colombia , the world &apos;s second largest coffee producer , on Thursday ordered truckers to end a five-day strike was seen as weighing on the market . 
coffee futures of the robusta type for May delivery in London closed were $ 28 lower at $ 1,605 a tonne , while July arabica futures in New York were down 1.90 cents per lb at 191.50 cents at midday . 
cocoa futures were slightly firmer on the day , supported by continuing worries that Ivorian shippers were having difficulty meeting their commitments . 
world oil prices were steady at higher levels , but remained rangebound for much of the day on lack of any fundamental news . 
benchmark North Sea Brent blend crude oil for June pushed back up to hold above the $ 18 a barrel level , trading around at around $ 18.16 in London &apos;s afternoon . 
gold stayed within the narrow price band it has occupied for nearly two weeks as the market continued to look for stimulation . 
gold prices hovered either side of the $ 341 per ounce mark throughout the day .
