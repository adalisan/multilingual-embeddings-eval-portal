the China commodity futures Exchange in the southern province of Hainan said on Tuesday that it will raise its margin requirement on the key September 1997 rubber contract to 10 percent as of August 22 . 
the current margin requirement is 6.5 percent , traders said . 
the measure is aimed at controlling market risk , an exchange statement said . 
traders said risk had risen sharply following a short squeeze on the August contract where more than 140,000 tonnes were left for physical delivery . 
the August contract has already expired and deliveries began on Monday .
