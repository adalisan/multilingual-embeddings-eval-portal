Nigeria &apos;s military government is using a carrot-and-stick appraoch in talks with a Commonwealth team seeking to nudge the country towards democracy and respect for human rights , sources at the talks said on Wednesday . 
the government on Tuesday freed three political activists held without a charge for nearly a year while blasting leading Commonwealth members Britain and Canada for their &quot; anti-Nigeria stance . 
&quot; It is a classic carrot-and-stick approach , freedom for dissidents to appease us and attack on some of our members , &quot; said a senior member of the mission who asked not to be named . 
&quot; The Commonwealth is already split over Nigeria and it is obvious that the aim of the Nigerians is to maintain this split into the next summit , &quot; he added . 
the next summit of the 53-member club of Britain and its former colonies is due to be held in Edinburgh , Scotland next year and Nigeria will be high on the agenda . 
Africa &apos;s most populous nation is treated as a pariah for alleged human rights abuses and last year &apos;s hanging of nine minority rights activists including writer Ken Saro-Wiwa , which caused its suspension from the Commonwealth . 
the eight-member Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group ( CMAG ) was then set up to pressure Nigeria to restore civil rule and respect human rights in line with the Commonwealth &apos;s Harare declaration on good governance . 
Nigeria says the two-day Abuja meeting , which will end on Wednesday , is a continuation of contacts with the Commonwealth which Nigeria hopes will lead to its readmission to the Commonwealth . 
during a meeting with CMAG ministers on Tuesday , Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi launched a blistering attack on Canada for pulling out of the CMAG visit , accusing it of trying to destabilise Nigeria . 
&quot; We have overwhelming evidence that both at home in Canada and as well as here in Nigeria , Canada is providing substantial financial assistance to agencies and individuals working for the destabilisation of our country , &quot; Ikimi told the opening session . 
Canada pulled out of the meeting at the last minute in protest against the non-issuance of visas to two officials it said were to provide security to its delegation . 
but Ikimi said &quot; Canada tried to bring in armed soldiers as part of its delegation to this CMAG under the guise that they are diplomats . 
Canada has been pushing hard for the Commonwealth to take tough action against Abuja on human rights and democracy . 
Ikimi also attacked Britain , saying remarks by British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind in a London television programme that Nigeria could be expelled from the Commonwealth , were provocative . 
the CMAG ministers met military ruler General Sani Abacha late on Tuesday . 
&quot; Although it was a courtesy call , the meeting went quite well , &quot; Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge told Reuters , adding : &quot; We are progressing well , no hitches yet . 
Tuesday &apos;s release of the three activists still leaves a number of government opponents in detention , including Moshood Abiola , the presumed winner of a 1993 presidential election whose annulment plunged Nigeria into political turmoil . 
Nigeria wants its suspension to be lifted , a decision that can only be taken by the Commonwealth summit on recommendation of CMAG , which is made up of foreign ministers of Zimbabwe , Ghana , New Zealand , Jamaica , Britain , South Africa , Malaysia and Canada . 
the CMAG ministers were being briefed on Wednesday by the electoral and the body implementing Abacha &apos;s programme to restore democracy in 1998 , a period considered too long by his critics as well as the Commonwealth .
