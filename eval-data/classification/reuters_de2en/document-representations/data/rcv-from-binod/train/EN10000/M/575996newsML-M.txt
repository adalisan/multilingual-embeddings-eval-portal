earlier this year , market analysts joked that stock investment had become Taiwan &apos;s national sport with a dazzling year-long rally showing no signs of stopping and the index bounding to new highs almost daily . 
Monday &apos;s big politically-inspired selloff rudely reminded investors that all sports have losers , slashing 3.72 percent from the index in a tumble that saw reliable support evaporate . 
it was the biggest single-day fall since January 1996 . 
&quot; Those who said it was not a dream for the index to hit 9,000 points all keep their mouths shut now , &quot; said Oliver Fang , an analyst of National Securities . 
&quot; Even if it &apos;s not a dream , it &apos;s not likely to happen anytime this year , &quot; Fang added . 
Taiwan &apos;s stock market has been one of the world &apos;s best performing markets over the past 12 months , rising 25 percent in 1997 alone before an alarming islandwide outbreak of hog-farm epidemic sent the index back below 8,000 points in late March . 
but the market quickly returned to its winning ways , moving to its highest levels in seven years and weathering a brief late-April correction . 
on Monday , the rules of the game appeared to have changed . 
the weighted index plunged 307.55 points or 3.72 percent , most of it in the final hour of trade , to close at 7,966.64 . 
the tremor rumbled through the foreign exchange market . 
despite the greenback &apos;s weakness overseas , the Taiwan dollar plunged to end at T $ 27.759 on Monday against Saturday &apos;s T $ 27.660 close as funds that were pulled out of the stock market flowed out of the market to better-performing overseas markets . 
analysts said the stock slump indicated the market was heading for a medium-term correction , with downside support seen at around 7,500 points . 
experts said deeply unsettled domestic politics , rather than economic jitters , were to blame for the market &apos;s downturn as recent data show the island &apos;s economic outlook to be sound . 
a Reuters poll of economists projects year-on-year growth of 6.48 percent for Taiwan &apos;s gross domestic product in the first quarter of 1997 , above the state &apos;s own most-recent forecast . 
&quot; The domestic political situation is quite uncertain at the moment , so the stock market is too , &quot; said Amy Huang , a market economist at Nomura Securities . 
premier LIEN Chan , facing intense criticism over the government &apos;s failure to check a spate of violent crimes , was scheduled to announce a partial cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday . 
local media have leaked a list of relatively modest cabinet changes -- to mixed public and investor reaction . 
adding uncertainty was opposition lawmakers &apos; plan to demand on Tuesday that President Lee Teng-hui undertake a more sweeping cabinet reshuffle and sack Premier LIEN , who Lee has been grooming as his successor , brokers said . 
&quot; The ( stock ) freefall shows collapsing investor confidence , &quot; said foremost Investment Service analyst Wang Jieh . 
civic groups planned mass street demonstrations on Sunday in a new show of mounting public discontent . 
some 50,000 people marched in Taipei on May 4 to denounce a perceived worsening of social order after the kidnap and murder of a celebrity &apos;s teenage daughter , the latest in a string of horrific -- and still unsolved -- crimes to hit the island . 
national &apos;s Fang said : &quot; Political uncertainties always have a great impact on the stock market because they are beyond control of ordinary people . 
&quot; The future is still very uncertain .
