MCN Investment has agreed to invest an undisclosed amount for PanEnergy &apos;s 18.1 percent equity interest in the partnership . 
MCV , the nation &apos;s largest cogeneration facility , can produce up to 1,370 megawatts ( MW ) of electricity and 1.35 million pounds per hour of process steam for industrial use . 
&quot; It is an operating facility that will contribute immediately to our earnings , &quot; he said in a statement . 
when PanEnergy and Duke Power complete a proposed $ 7.7 billion merger , the MCV partnership will exceed the percentage ownership by electric utilities allowed by federal law under which MCV operates . 
&quot; Although we are disappointed that the company will no longer be a partner in MCV , PanEnergy will continue to pursue ownership and control of those categories of power generation where electric utility ownership limitations do not apply , &quot; said Paula Rosput , president of PanEnergy Power Services Inc . 
MCV sells electricity to Consumers Energy Co and Dow Chemical Co under long-term contracts . 
closing of the purchase agreement is expected by May 30 and is subject to certain regulatory approvals .
