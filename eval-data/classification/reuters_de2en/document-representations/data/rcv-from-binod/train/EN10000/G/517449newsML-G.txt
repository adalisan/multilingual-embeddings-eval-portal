House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich announced on Thursday he will pay a $ 300,000 ethics penalty with a loan from 1996 Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole . 
Gingrich &apos;s move to escape a dilemma -- how to pay a heavy financial penalty out of pocket -- produced the odd-couple spectacle of one U.S. political celebrity riding to the rescue of another with whom he has often had rocky relations . 
Republicans stood and applauded the speaker as he explained in a House speech during his address to the House that &quot; as a person of limited means I have arranged to borrow the money from Bob Dole , a close personal friend . 
Gingrich , who often clashed with the more centrist Dole when Dole was Senate majority leader , promised he would &quot; personally pay ( the loan ) back &quot; -- to a man whom , as many in his audience could easily recall , he once called the &quot; tax collector for the welfare state . 
the arrangement in any case stunned political Washington and drew fire from some Democrats as an unseemly bargain . 
it was not clear if Gingrich had succeeded in resolving a nagging problem that has diminished his formidable political influence and clouded his political future . 
the House voted 395-28 in January to reprimand him for using tax-exempt funds to promote political goals and misleading House investigators . 
he was the first speaker ever to receive such a punishment and he afterwards adopted a lower public profile , although he has been on the rebound lately . 
Gingrich agreed last January to repay $ 300,000 in taxpayer costs expended by House investigators in his case . 
under the agreement with Dole , Gingrich will pay 10 percent a year interest on the loan , compounded . 
the loan would be due and payable within eight years , collectible only from Gingrich and could not be forgiven , a statement said . 
in his House speech , Gingrich asserted he could have legally used campaign funds or a defence trust fund to pay the ethics penalty or could have sued the lawyers who he said had misled him into what he calls a technical ethics violation . 
but he said he and his wife , Marianne , &quot; came to the conclusion ... that I have a moral obligation to pay the $ 300,000 out of personal funds , that any other choice would simply be seen as one more politician shirking his duty . 
&quot; Therefore , as a person of limited means , I have arranged to borrow the money from Bob Dole , a close personal friend ... and I will personally pay it . 
the taxpayers will be fully reimbursed ... 
this is my duty as speaker and I will do it . 
Gingrich &apos;s press secretary Christina Martin said the idea of the loan came from Dole . 
in a statement , Dole applauded Gingrich &apos;s decision , saying he had &quot; yet again shown himself to be a man of integrity &quot; and had set an example of accountability and ethics . 
&quot; I consider this not only an opportunity to help a friend but a long-term investment in the party , &quot; he said . 
ironically , Dole and Gingrich -- men of different political generations and philosophies -- were seen as anything but close friends when Gingrich became speaker in 1995 and Dole was Republican leader in the Senate . 
the two mended fences . 
but Dole has told supporters he felt his 1996 presidential campaign against President Bill Clinton was doomed in large part because Democrats succeeded in linking him in the public mind with Gingrich , a widely unpopular leader considered by many a political extremist . 
since his defeat last November Dole has remained in the public eye , often appearing in television commercials . 
tax records show he and his wife Elizabeth are multimillionaires . 
Gingrich has said he will retire in 2002 and presumably could then make much more money to help repay his loan . 
his salary as speaker is $ 171,500 . 
he is also earning royalties from his book &quot; To renew America . 
Typifying adverse Democratic reaction to the Dole loan was Representative George Miller of California , who charged that Dole was effectively a &quot; lobbyist &quot; for the tobacco industry during the presidential campaign . 
&quot; This is a sad day for the House of Representatives when the tobacco industry is paying the legal fines , &quot; Miller said . 
representative David Bonior of Michigan claimed the loan itself should spark another ethics investigation . 
&quot; Is this a sweetheart deal for Newt Gingrich or is this a deal any American could have ? 
&quot; Bonior asked . 
but Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle said he saw nothing improper in Gingrich &apos;s acceptance of the loan . 
&quot; I think Speaker Gingrich handled this matter by and large in a manner most people will find reasonably acceptable , &quot; he said .
