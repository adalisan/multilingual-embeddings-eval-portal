June notionnel futures on MATIF were starting to flag on Thursday and a dip towards support at 129.40 was likely , technical analysts said . 
&quot; sell on rallies should be the word for today , &quot; Christian Bado , senior technical analyst at Ferrier Lullin in Geneva . 
&quot; It will try a dip on the downside toward 129.40 . 
Bado said the contract has completed a five-wave structure according to Elliott Wave theory and would now reverse . 
the a wave would take it to 129.40 and the b wave back up for a small bounce to 129.80 resistance . 
the c wave would complete the correction at 129.00 , he said . 
that level was also near the bottom of the recent range at 129.02 on June 4 . 
Bado said a move above 129.80 should trigger stop losses towards 130.10 . 
daily charts show the peak of the recent range at 130.14 on May 21 . 
Marc de la Croix , broker at staff in Paris , said the market was quiet in early trade and support at 129.46,50 should hold firm . 
&quot; We think we should go back to this level and rebound toward 129.84,86 , &quot; he said . 
September Pibor were quoted at 96.44 at 0752 GMT , up two basis points from Wednesday . 
technical analysts at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell at London said the contract would meet resistance at 96.49 . 
a break through there would find a stronger barrier at 96.54 from a down trendline drawn off the January highs . 
&quot; This is expected to be remain the dominant structure for one-to-two weeks , &quot; they said in a research note . 
&quot; Look for another test lower in that time to 96.33 and to a deeper retracement at 96.30 .
