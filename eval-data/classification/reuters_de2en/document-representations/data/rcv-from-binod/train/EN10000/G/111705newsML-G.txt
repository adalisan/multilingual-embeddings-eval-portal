a United Nations report released on Friday warned of looming disaster in the eastern Zaire province of North Kivu from mounting ethnic conflict it said was partly due to incitement by Zairean officials . 
the report , by Chilean human rights investigator Robert Garreto , was issued as the world body &apos;s refugee agency UNHCR said some 50-60 people were killed in an attack by unidentified men on a village in the area on Wednesday . 
Garreto &apos;s report , which followed a visit in July to refugee camps in Rwanda near the border with Zaire , said it was vital for the outside world to be aware of what was happening in Kivu , home to some three million people . 
he said international organisations working in the region -- already wracked by conflicts and civil strife in Rwanda and Burundi -- were working &quot; to stave off the cruellest consequences of a disaster already in the making . 
the report , the Chilean lawyer &apos;s third on the rights situation in the country since 1994 , said the &quot; state of Zaire &quot; had been both directly involved in human rights violations as well as inciting people to commit them 
it listed a series of incidents in which hundreds and perhaps thousands had died in attacks on peoples who had moved into Kivu over the last 100 years . 
known collectively as Banyarwanda , they make up about half of the region &apos;s population and include many Tutsis , the tribe that was subjected to genocide by the majority Hutus in Rwanda in 1994 but which now controls the government in Kigali . 
Garreto , whose request to visit the country in July was turned down by the Zairean authorities , is heading for Kinshasa to continue his investigations next week , U.N. officials said . 
his report said that , since over a million Rwandan Hutus fled into Kivu after their government was ousted by the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Army in the wake of the genocide , the overall ethnic situation in Kivu had become explosive . 
Hutus of the Interahamwe militia among the refugees , often with the connivance of Zairean troops , had begun to try to drive out the Tutsis , most of them in Zaire for decades . 
sharing the blame with the state , the report added , were the Zairean &quot; political class .... which has fomented xenophobic nationalist sentiment , &quot; some ethnic leaders and even some Zairean human rights groups &quot; which have chosen to foster racial hatred and ethnic cleansing rather than defending the oppressed . 
the report suggested Zaire &apos;s Minister of Higher Education , Sekimonyo Wa Magango , himself a Hutu , and Minister of Social Affairs desire Lumbulumbu had incited tribes seen as native to Zaire to expel Tutsis and other Banyarwanda groups . 
on a visit to North Kivu in late March , it said , &quot; they were unanimously understood to be advocating ethnic cleansing .... 
&quot; The Zairean armed forces have clearly sided with the Interahamwe and Hutu militias in the fighting ..... There are even reports that Interahamwe militias pay soldiers to take part , or at least to protect them during attacks , &quot; the report declared . 
Garreto said the world community had ignored the conflict in Northern Kivu , as well as similar problems developing in the south of the province &quot; reluctant perhaps to have its conscience pricked against after the horrors of Rwanda and Burundi . 
apart from the 1994 genocide in Rwanda , in which up to a million Tutsi and moderate Hutus died , tens of thousands of Tutsi and Hutu have died in three decades of conflict in neighbouring Burundi .
