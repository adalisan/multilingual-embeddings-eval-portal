revelations from an inquiry into the decapitation of a child for witchcraft purposes are tearing apart the eastern Nigerian town of Owerri . 
a commission charged with looking into the murder is searching for evidence among 40 buildings destroyed in the riots which followed the discovery of the headless body . 
old poverty is pitted against new wealth , Pentecostal churches against the Roman Catholics and many families against the authorities they say did not act quickly enough to stop the kidnapping and murder of their children . 
&quot; For now , the disappearances have stopped , but the criminals have only scattered and the children have been taken for ritual murder or sold into slave labour , &quot; said hospital doctor Darlington Amamasi . 
Amamasi &apos;s son Obinna would be 10 years old now -- if he was still alive . 
he was abducted in April 1995 and has not been seen since , despite the fact that his father paid a ransom of $ 5,000 to the kidnappers . 
nobody gives an exact figure for the number of children who disappeared , but about Ikechukwu Okoronkwo there is no doubt . 
the head of the 11-year-old groundnut hawker was found by police in September in the possession of a worker at a flashy hotel . 
exhumation of the body triggered two days of rioting in which all those who , like the hotel &apos;s owner , flaunted new wealth were targeted and their property burned . 
the windows of offices and supermarkets belonging to the suspects were smashed . 
smears of ash stretch up from the doors of what had been the town &apos;s grandest buildings . 
&quot; People saw that a few years ago a new class of people arrived in town living ostentatiously -- we call them &apos; 419 &apos; , &quot; said Modestus Unalaka , correspondent of The Champion newspaper . 
the &quot; 419 &quot; is the section of the Nigerian criminal code dealing with a particular type of fraud , but is now used in Owerri to describe anyone who appears to have got their money through unorthodox means . 
&quot; The newcomers could offer high rents and pay prices . 
they carried on like small gods , they could live their lives more cheaply , get their women more cheaply , &quot; said Unalaka . 
the &quot; new faces &quot; were not really new . 
they came from Owerri but had made their money from other parts of Nigeria or overseas . 
&quot; Last year , there were a lot of kidnappings , but it could not be proved that the big men were involved . 
this time the discovery of the corpse at the hotel was all the people needed to mete out their own justice , &quot; Unalaka said . 
parts of ritually killed people are said to be used in witchcraft by people trying to win power and influence . 
rioters accused some churches of playing a part in both the murders and the riots , generating religious strife as an added source of tension . 
the rioters said they had found two human skulls and a pot containing pepper soup in the Pentecostal Overcomers Church . 
the claims were debunked , but the Pentecostal Federation of Nigeria has accused Roman Catholics of whipping up youths to stamp out the growing influence of Pentecostal churches among largely Roman Catholic people . 
the Roman Catholic Church denies the accusations . 
father Christopher Ejizu , at the archdiocese of neighbouring Onitsha town , said : &quot; The riots in Owerri were a social phenomenon and not a religious one . 
they were about people &apos;s anger at others getting rich too quickly . 
it is not the job of the commission to put the accused on trial , which is what many in Owerri are now hoping for . 
but some of those accused by the mob have already left the area and nobody expects them to return quickly . 
&quot; The departure of these people has big implications . 
even if they pushed up rents , they were also big spenders . 
and if the people have driven them off , they will also have to live without their money , &quot; said Unalaka .
