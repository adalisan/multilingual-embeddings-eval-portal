Germany coach Berti Vogts has sent a letter to his players berating them for poor performances since they won the European championship last year . 
criticism of the national side has grown louder during their World Cup qualifying campaign during which Germany have looked unimpressive and drawn three of their six games . 
&quot; Every national team player has received a letter . 
it says that I &apos;m totally dissatisfied with the performances after the European championships , &quot; Vogts told Sunday &apos;s Welt am Sonntag newspaper . 
Vogts also warned his side would struggle to qualify for the World Cup and to make any impression on the tournament if players did not make enough effort in pre-season training . 
he also took a swipe at the huge salaries players now earn and the effect it has on their will to win . 
&quot; The national coach has the most difficult job . 
he has to tell 20 millionaires what to do . 
and anyone who earns that much money believes he does everything right , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I used to try to explain to every player why he wasn &apos;t playing . 
I don &apos;t do that any more because there &apos;s no point , &quot; the former Borussia Moenchengaldbach stalwart said . 
&quot; They believe their so-called friends more than they believe the coach . 
Germany lie second in their World Cup qualifying group , two points behind Ukraine . 
but Vogts &apos;s team still have an excellent chance of winning the group as their opponents have failed to take advantage of their poor performances . 
the group leaders have played two games more than Germany and third-placed Portugal are three points behind . 
Vogts hinted he would like to move to foreign pastures when his time as national team coach ends . 
&quot; Maybe I &apos;ll take on a completely new challenge -- why not abroad ? 
&quot; he said . 
&quot; In the 1970s Moenchengladbach refused to let me go to Ajax . 
I could have played in the best club side in the world . 
the feeling that I missed out on something is still there .
