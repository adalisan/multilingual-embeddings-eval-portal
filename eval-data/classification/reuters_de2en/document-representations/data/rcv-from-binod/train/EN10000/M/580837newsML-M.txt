Manila flour mills are expected to resume buying this week after prices slid overnight on the USDA &apos;s report of higher carryover wheat stocks for 1996-1997 , local flour executives and grains traders said on Tuesday . 
&quot; This is a welcome development . 
expect us to jump into the market , &quot; an executive in a local mill told Reuters . 
Philippine flour mills sent tender invitations for 90,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat last week . 
only one mill bought 7,500 tonnes of soft wheat because the other mills received offers higher than expected , a senior trader said . 
&quot; Get ready for another round of tenders from other mills which have yet to buy their requirements for June , &quot; said another trader . 
but not all commodities traders in Manila were happy about the fall of U.S. wheat , corn , soyoil , soybean and soymeal prices overnight due to better-than-expected 1996-1997 carryover stocks . 
Philippine vegetable oil traders said the collapse of soybean and soymeal prices would further depress coconut oil prices . 
&quot; This is more bad news for coconut oil , coming at a time of rising copra supplies from the Philippines , &quot; said a senior trader in one of the country &apos;s largest coconut mills . 
prospects of better Philippine coconut harvests in the second half of the year pulled down copra prices to nine pesos per kg from 10.50 the previous weeek . 
crude coconut oil also dipped to 16 pesos per kg from the previous 17.30 . 
the drop in domestic prices of copra and coconut oil will spill over in international markets , traders said . 
coconut Oil refiners Association president Jesus Arranza said recently he expected Philippine coconut oil exports to rise between 1.2 and 1.3 million tonnes this year against 813,157 tonnes in 1996 . 
corn , soymeal and soybean buyers are expected to remain in the sidelines even with lower U.S. prices , traders said . 
&quot; We had made orders for our soybean requirement up to June this year , &quot; said an executive in a Philippine firm . 
&quot; For futures orders that we have made earlier , we can peg prices today . 
soymeal buyers said they have ample supplies while local hog and poultry farmers said they were still awaiting government &apos;s approval on their proposal to buy 300,000 tonnes of corn for animal feed .
