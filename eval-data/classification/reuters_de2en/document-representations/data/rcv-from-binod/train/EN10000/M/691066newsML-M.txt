investors in South Korean and Thai bonds should be wary , Union Bank of Switzerland said on Thursday , citing currency concerns and problems in the Thai bank sector and more problems for South Korea &apos;s conglomerates . 
&quot; At current levels , certain bonds look very cheap , &quot; said Steve Williams , UBS head of fixed income research and new issues . 
&quot; Yet we would highlight the likelihood of continued spread volatility in response to ongoing structural adjustments in either country , &quot; he said in a statement . 
he said there were &quot; currency concerns &quot; in Thailand , and &quot; the potential for conditions in the country &apos;s finance sector to get worse &quot; . 
&quot; For Korea , the probability that more chaebols ( conglomerates ) will encounter difficulties is high , and this is likely to put further pressure on the country &apos;s banks , &quot; Williams said . 
but he said prospects for the Korean convertible market were more promising , thanks to a weakening of the won against the yen , helping Korean exporters and sparking a stockmarket rally . 
UBS continued to recommend an overweight position in China and Hong Kong bonds , he said . 
it also maintained an overweight position on Malaysian credits &quot; given their stability and greater resilience to the negative sentiment which affected Asian and emerging markets worldwide earlier this year &quot; , Williams said .
