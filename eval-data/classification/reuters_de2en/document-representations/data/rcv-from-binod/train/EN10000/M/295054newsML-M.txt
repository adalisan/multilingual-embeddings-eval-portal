&quot; LME copper was up sharply last night despite sharp rises in the stockpiles data , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; Shanghai investors are wondering if there will be some big positive news . 
&quot; The heavy volume indicated that copper is likely to rise further in the next few days , &quot; he added .

&quot; copper rose sharply but open interest did not rise , which was an expression of the concerns many investors have , &quot; a second trader said .
