California teenager Troy Dumais , the diver some are calling the next Greg Louganis , won his second national title Friday night at the USA Senior National diving Championships . 
Dumais , 17 , of Ventura , California , defended his 1-metre springboard title , a non-Olympic event . 
he qualified for the September 10-14 World Cup championships in Mexico City and world aquatic championships in Perth , Australia , in January . 
Dumais topped a 29-diver field , pared down to six for the final round . 
he totaled 399.33 points for six dives . 
five out of six of his dives had a degree of difficulty of 3.0 and higher . 
last week , Dumais broke the national record for most junior titles ( 16 ) at the junior national championships . 
Dumais narrowly missed making the 1996 U.S. Olympic team , finishing third on 3-metres at the Olympic trials . 
several coaches have compared Dumais to the great Louganis for his strength and artistry on the boards . 
Louganis won four Olympic gold and one silver medals in three Olympics ( 1976 , 1984 , 1988 ) before retiring in 1988 . 
&quot; It is flattering to be compared to Greg Louganis , he is the greatest of all time , &quot; Dumais said . 
&quot; But I would rather be known for myself and my own dives and not be compared to any other diver . 
the seven-day World Cup and world championship qualifying meet continues through Sunday . 
it is only the second major diving meet in the United States since the Summer Olympics in Atlanta .
