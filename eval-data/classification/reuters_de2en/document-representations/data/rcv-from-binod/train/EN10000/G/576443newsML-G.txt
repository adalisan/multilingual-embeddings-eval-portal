a French prosecutor asked a court on Monday to scrap prison sentences levelled against two rap singers for lyrics savaging the police and to impose fines instead . 
singers Bruno Lopez , also known as Kool Shen , and Didier Morville , called Joey Star , each received six-month jail terms , three of them suspended and a six-month performing ban when first tried in November . 
they remained free pending the outcome of their appeal . 
both are members of the NTM rap group popular among some youths , especially in deprived outer suburbs of main cites , but targeted by conservative politicians and police unions . 
NTM stands for &quot; Nique Ta mere &quot; ( Fuck Your Mother ) in street slang . 
the initial ruling had triggered fierce debate in France over censorship and respect for public officials . 
justice Minister Jacques Toubon had said soon after the judgment that the government would appeal against the sentences . 
the Aix-en-Provence prosecutor asked on Monday that a 50,000 franc ( $ 8,800 ) be levelled instead of the prison terms . 
police unions , who had hailed the initial judgment as a check on unbridled attacks on law enforcement authorities , had urged that the sentence be left unchanged . 
the court action had been launched by 26 policemen who were on crowd control duty at a concert featuring the band . 
they testified the group used the following lyrics during their performance : 
the police are the fascists and the murderers . 
it &apos;s those motherfuckers in blue and the courts who bust our balls all year round ... our enemies are the men in blue and we piss on them .
