Indonesian palm olein prices were weaker in late trading on Monday in line with a plunge in soyoil prices in Chicago following the release of bearish U.S. soybean production figures by the USDA , traders said . 
they said olein was around 1,380-90 rupiah / kg in Jakarta , compared with 1,390-95 rupiah at the opening . 
one player was heard offering small quantities at 1,370-75 rupiah . 
the decline comes in the wake of the release last Friday of a USDA report showing 1996 U.S. soybean production totalling 2.346 billion bushels , well above trade expections and a September USDA forecast for 2.270 billion . 
&quot; I had no choice but to cut prices , &quot; one trader with a major plantation house said . 
&quot; The USDA report and its impact on soyoil prices in Chicago is pushing down palm oil prices . 
the report triggered a sharp fall in Malaysian prices . 
traders said the already weak sentiment in the local market , where prices have been declining steadily the last three weeks , had been further dampened by the USDA report . 
&quot; I see a further downside in local prices , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; Some players have begun to sell aggresively and others are chasing these prices .
