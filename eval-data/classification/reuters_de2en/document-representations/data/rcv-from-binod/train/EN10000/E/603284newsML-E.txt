the U.S. Federal Reserve may raise its federal funds rate when the core rate of the U.S. consumer price index rises to 2.8 percent , said Wayne Angell , chief economist at Bear Stearns &amp; Co and a former U.S. Federal Reserve Governor . 
&quot; My guess would be that the timing of the next FF ( Fed funds ) rate increase will not be due to the employment cost index in the second quarter , &quot; he said . 
&quot; When we see a 2.8 percent core ( CPI ) , that probably would be the point in time at which we will see another FF rate increase , &quot; he added . 
when asked about recent volatile moves in the currency markets , Angell declined to comment on specific dollar / yen rates and suggested it was more of a problem of yen policy . 
he added that there could not be a stable dollar / yen rate until Japan &apos;s trade surplus proceeds toward zero . 
&quot; Certainly , Japan will miss out on world prosperity until it adopts policies that will lead to a stable dollar / yen rate , &quot; he said . 
he did not elaborate .
