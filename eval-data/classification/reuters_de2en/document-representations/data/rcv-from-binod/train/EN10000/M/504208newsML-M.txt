Hong Kong stocks finished on a strong note on Friday as hopes that the market had hit a short-term bottom spurred buying in the banking sector , while China-plays also benefited from keen interest . 
the Hang Seng Index closed on a gain of 157.90 points , or 1.28 percent , at 12,516.60 , bringing the week &apos;s gains to 312.01 points , or 2.56 percent . 
&quot; It seems like turnover is picking up so buying interest is also recovering , &quot; said Ben Kwong , director of research at Dharmala Securities . 
he said Hong Kong shares had been hovering at lower levels over recent sessions without meeting strong selling pressure and Wall Street share prices seemed to have stabilised after a recent decline . 
&quot; Investors have already discounted some of the concern about an interest rate hike so there is continued bargain-hunting at lower levels , &quot; said Kwong . 
analysts said banking shares had been oversold and were the main beneficiaries of bargain-hunting . 
China-related shares were also boosted . 
&quot; Over the last couple of weeks , people were concerned about rising interest rates in the U.S. but now inflation in China is coming down and investors are expecting China to lower interest rates , &quot; said Yamaichi International head of research Alex Tang . 
China &apos;s retail price inflation rose 1.7 percent in March following retail price inflation of 2.9 percent in February . 
an official at China &apos;s State Planning Commission Economic Research Institute said on Friday that China &apos;s benchmark retail price inflation could slow more quickly than expected in 1997 , to three to four percent for the year . 
the H-share index surged 29.88 points to 1,034.90 . 
China Light rose HK $ 0.80 to HK $ 35.30 following news that it had signed a Shenzhen power plant joint venture agreement with Exxon Corp.
