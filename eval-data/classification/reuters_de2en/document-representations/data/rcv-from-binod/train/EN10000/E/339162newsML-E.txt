Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Tuesday that the outlook for business investment has strengthened . 
Costello said the inflation outcome for 1996 / 97 to June 30 could be even better than the latest forecast , while he expected wages growth of 4.5 percent in 1996 / 97 . 
&quot; To the extent that recent inflation outcomes reflect a faster than usual rate of exchange rate pass-through into retail prices , inflation outcomes could be even better in 1996 / 97 but higher than forecast in 1997 / 98 , &quot; Costello said . 
in the government &apos;s mid-year budget reviewed released on Tuesday , the business investment forecast was revised upwards to 17 percent from 14 percent forecast in the August budget . 
in the review , Costello revised down the forecast for underlying inflation in the fiscal year to June 30 , 1997 , against the 2.75 percent projected in the August budget . 
the Treasury &apos;s underlying measure of inflation excludes items whose prices are highly volatile , exhibit marked seasonal patterns , or are largely effected by policy decisions . 
these items include meat , clothing , tobacco , alchohol , holiday travel and accomodation , fuel health services local government charges and education .
