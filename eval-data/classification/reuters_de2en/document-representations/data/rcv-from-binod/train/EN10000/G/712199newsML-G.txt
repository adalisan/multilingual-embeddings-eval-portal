the losing bidder for two new Hungarian commercial TV channels said on Monday it would challenge the Hungarian radio and television body &apos;s decision to award a concessions contract to Magyar RTL and MTM-SBS . 
but Orszagos Radio es Televizio Testulet ( ORTT ) , which announced the winners on June 30 , said on Monday the court challenge would not delay signing of the 10-year concession contracts with Luxembourg-based CLT &apos;s Magyar RTL and MTM-SBS . 
loser Irisz TV , a consortium led by U.S.-based Central Media Enterprises with Hungarian companies , Mediacom , Intercom and DDTV Kft , said it challenged the decision and asked a court to forbid the signing of the concession contracts . 
&quot; The ORTT seriously breached the regulations when assessing the bids and violated the tender procedures , &quot; Irisz TV said in a statement . 
the CLT-led consortium , Magyar RTL , is owned by a consortium of CLT-UFA , Raiffeisen Unicbank , UK Pearson group , publisher of the Financial Times , and Hungarian telecom company Matav . 
MTM-SBS is a consortium of the Hungarian-registered company MTM Kommunikacios RT , TeleMunchen and majority U.S.-owned company Scandinavian Broadcasting System . 
Magyar RTL offered 9 billion forints ( $ 47.9 million ) for the commercial channel it won , while MTM-SBS offered the set minimum of 8 billion forints for the other commercial channel . 
opposition parties delegate five of the eight-person board , two are delegated by the ruling parties and the president is neutral . 
during the second round , newspapers quoted an opposition member of the board talking about an expert &apos;s opinion that Irisz TV &apos;s business plan was not consistent with the higher price it offered . 
but a consortium of four independent companies had earlier assessed the tenders and said all four offers were consistent with the business plans . 
ORTT said at the time of the decision that one important factor in the decision was diversifying Hungary &apos;s future media scene . 
it said the verdict was unanimous aside from one abstention . 
the decision ended seven years of political wrangling that has left Hungary &apos;s media privatisation trailing other former communist countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic , which already have commercial national television stations .
