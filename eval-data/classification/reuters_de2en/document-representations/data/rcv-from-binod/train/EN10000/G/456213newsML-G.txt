a Cypriot thalassaemia sufferer on Thursday gave birth to triplets after fertility treatment in what her doctors said was the first case reported worldwide . 
Xenia Nicolaou Ioannou , 28 , gave birth at 29 weeks to two girls and a boy by Caesarian section at a hospital in the capital Nicosia on Thursday . 
&quot; This is the first time worldwide that a thalassaemic mother gives birth to triplets , &quot; said Gavriel Kalakoutis , Director of the obstetrics and Gynaecology Department at the Makarios III hospital . 
&quot; A pregnant woman with thalassaemia is in a very high risk group at catching various diseases and ailments , &quot; Kalakoutis added . 
the infants , a girl weighing 1 kg ( 2.20 pounds ) , a boy 1 kg and the second girl 680 grammes , are in incubators while the mother is in a good condition but is being watched closely , Kalakoutis said . 
the infants carry the thalassaemia stigma but do not have the major disease . 
Thalassaemia , also known as Cooley &apos;s anaemia , is a hereditary blood disease widespread in Mediterranean countries , Africa and Asia . 
the disease is caused by an abnormality in the protein part of blood &apos;s haemoglobin which causes disfunctions of the red blood cells , leading to anaemia . 
Thalassaemia sufferers need regular blood transfusions , though stigma carriers are usually symptom free .
