German shares closed at new record highs on Thursday , boosted by massive overnight Wall Street gains , firm DTB future contracts and the seemingly unshakeable resilience of the U.S. dollar . 
the DAX , which gauges trade in 30 blue-chip German stocks , ended at 3,229.48 points , up 13.34 points or 0.41 percent , having gone as high as 3,232.14 points over the session . 
&quot; If the futures market keeps up the advance , then we could see a rally like we did on Wednesday , &quot; said one trader , referring to post-bourse electronic trade which pushed the IBIS index up to a further record of 3,259.25 . 
the electronic index eventually closed up 1.43 percent at 3,256.86 as March DAX futures surged 48.0 points to 3,272.0 later in the day . 
the U.S. currency acted as support to German share values throughout the day , appearing comfortable at above its newly-discovered 1.680 mark level . 
because of the dollar strength , the market found support from export-sensitive shares , including carmakers such as Volkswagen AG , which ended floor trade up 15.50 marks at 818 . 
but some traders were nervous at the recent spell of heady gains , insisting the market was overbought and that a correction was overdue , especially if Wall Street hesitated . 
market attention had focused on electronics group Siemens AG , which ended up 30 pfennigs at 87.35 marks early on , off earlier highs of 87.60 marks . 
Siemens said on Thursday it has revised upward its outlook for sales and incoming orders for both the 1996 / 97 business year and also the 1997 / 98 business year . 
among other shares , utility group Viag AG initally fell after the Berliner Zeitung newspaper reported that the leaders of rival utility Veba AG and British Telecom were in secret talks about cooperation in the telecommunications industry . 
Viag and BT currently have a partnership but Veba is seeking a new partner after Britain &apos;s Cable and wireless pulled out of the alliance . 
Viag shares pared losses over the session and ended bourse trade down 3.50 marks at 709 marks .
