the sign outside the display in the primate section of Copenhagen Zoo is much like those of the surrounding Orang-utangs , baboons and Gibbons . 
a map of the world shows the animal &apos;s geographical distribution -- just about everywhere -- and key facts are noted : 
period of gestation : nine months 
number of young per birth : one 
reaches sexual maturity : 13-17 years of age 
weight 50-100 kg . 
lifespan : 75-85 years 
diet : omnivorous 
the name of the newest inmate of the primate house is given in Danish as Menneske , with its Latin , English and German equivalents -- Homo sapiens , Human Being , Mensch . 
in what it says is a unique exercise , Copenhagen Zoo has let local couple Henrik Lehmann and Malene Botoft move into a perspex-walled hut between the ruffed lemurs and the baboons where they will live under the public gaze until September 15 . 
Lehman , an acrobat by trade , says the object is to bring humans into contact with their simian roots . 
&quot; We love to look at apes . 
the most popular animal to look at the world over -- apart from the predators -- are apes because they remind us so much of people , &quot; he told Reuters over a beer in the couple &apos;s small but cosy air-conditioned enclosure . 
&quot; monkeys and gorillas have 98.5 percent of human chromosomes , only 1.5 percent separates us from the monkeys , so I thought , if we were to display people , not under ape conditions but the way we are , it would make people think . 
zoo information official Peter Vestergaard said that the Homo sapiens display was partly for fun but , like Lehmann , he hoped it could also encourage people to confront their origins . 
&quot; We are all primates . 
( Lehmann and Botoft ) are monkeys in a way but some people find that hard to accept . 
this is a way to maybe help people realise that , &quot; he said . 
the cash-strapped zoo was happy to go along with the idea as long as its potential exhibits could finance it themselves , so they spent three months wooing sponsors , eventually winning support from a multinational computer company , a local brewery , motorcycle dealers and a daily newspaper . 
on August 25 they moved in , doing much of the installation work themselves . 
Botoft &apos;s diary , published in the Danish daily Berlingske Tidende where she works as a secretary and motorcycle writer , describes the first hours as a zoo inmate . 
&quot; We were near fainting from exhaustion and I could hardly get up but I made a cup of coffee with warm milk , &quot; she wrote . 
&quot; I drank it on the sofa and ate a meatball with cheese while people looked at us . 
Henrik slept . 
Botoft noted that while adults hastened on to look at the real apes , seemingly uncomfortable at seeing humans on zoological display , children seemed to prefer looking at their own species . 
&quot; Children find it easier to observe us , they come close up and keep staring , &quot; she wrote . 
the neighbours , particularly the baboons , she found entertaining during the day but the lemurs next door became tiresome at night . 
&quot; There are only two of them but they make a noise as if they were at least 30 . 
exactly once every hour they mark their territory with uninhibited screaming , &quot; she said . 
the couple &apos;s nest boasts a combined kitchen-living room , an adjoining bedroom and a small workshop where Lehmann works at his passion -- restoring classic British motorcycles . 
it also boasts a sofa , chairs , bookshelves and other typical features of the human habitat ; fax , computer , television , stereo and telephone . 
toilet and washing facilities are in a nearby zoo building . 
throughout the day the human exhibits go about their business , cooking , cleaning , reading and listening to music , while specators peer through the perspex . 
the more intimate aspects of human behaviour are not on display : &quot; That &apos;s not interesting , &quot; Lehmann said . 
unlike their furry neighbours the couple are free to move around the zoo although one always remains in their quarters during opening hours . 
&quot; We can go out , the animals can &apos;t , that is our advantage , &quot; Lehmann said . 
guided groups of visitors come through the zoo after the six p.m. closing time but by 8.30 they are left with only the animals for company . 
unlike the other animals Lehman and Botoft have an e-mail address and a postbox ; Homo sapiens , Henrik and Malene , zoological gardens , Soendre Fasanvej 79 , 2000 Copenhagen F , Denmark , and are keen to hear what others think of their project .
