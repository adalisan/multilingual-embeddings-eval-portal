Japanese buyers are likely to hold back purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans after covering between about 70 to 80 percent of their April / June requirements by the end of last week , traders said on Monday . 
their lead will be followed by major East Asian buyers in South Korea , the Philippines and Taiwan , especially after a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) supply-demand report last week sparked a jump in Chicago futures prices . 
&quot; We may slow imports of U.S. corn this week as firming freight rates prompted Japanese traders to buy corn at a quicker pace last week , &quot; one Tokyo-based trader said . 
a slight rise in premiums for U.S. corn may also make buyers cautious , he added . 
U.S. corn premiums edged up on Monday to about 97 U.S. cents a bushel over the CBOT May contract compared with about 95 cents last week . 
freight rates from the U.S. Gulf to Japan rose last week to US $ 26.50 a tonne for nearby shipment from the previous week &apos;s $ 24.50 a tonne . 
rates firmed on steady demand for vessels to ship steel and coal , shipping sources said . 
&quot; We are watching for the possibility that freight rates ( may ease ) to around $ 25 , as we expect export demand for U.S. corn to slow in the next few weeks , &quot; one trader said . 
Japanese importers are currently buying U.S. soybeans for April shipment and premiums were quoted at about 117 U.S. cents a bushel over the CBOT March position , traders said . 
in South Korea , most corn buyers are likely to hold back purchases while the bullish trend continues , but could revive orders for up to 112,000 tonnes if prices soften , with some of the grain likely to be sourced from China , they said . 
the buyers are also looking at the possible purchase of some 100,000 tonnes of corn from Argentina as their favoured shipment period coincides with the country &apos;s export season . 
South Korea could take up more corn from China in small cargoes if Beijing approves of further exports in the second half of this year . 
&quot; If China offers corn again with an attractive price like in January , we are willing to buy more , &quot; a trader with Cheiljedang Corp said . 
another trader said South Korean trading house Daewoo Corp could become a major buyer of Chinese corn as Daewoo is a significant supplier in the domestic market . 
South Korean edible oil producers are expected to buy about 70,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans over the next few days despite the recent surge in Chicago futures prices , traders said . 
Sam Yang Foods Co Ltd , one of South Korea &apos;s major soybean processors , bought 15,000 tonnes of soybeans last Friday . 
Shindongbang Corp and Cheiljedang Corp plan to buy a total of 70,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans this week , officials with the two companies said . 
a trader with a Seoul-based foreign grain trading house said the freight rate from the U.S. Pacific Northwest to South Korea remained firm at $ 14 a tonne , while the rate from the U.S. Gulf also remained unchanged at $ 24 a tonne . 
in the Philippines , the government is checking Asian prices ahead of its planned import of up to 650,000 tonnes of rice to beef up local stocks , traders said . 
but Manila-based buyers of other grains and oilseed are seen sitting out of the market because they find current prices too high , the traders added . 
in Taiwan , buyers are also expected to stay on the sidelines although the Kaohsiung division of the breakfast soybean Procurement Association may retender for one 54,000-tonne shipment of U.S. soybeans it passed on last week . 
the Taiwan flour Mills Association will also tender for one 26,000-tonne shipment of U.S. wheat on Wednesday . 
local traders said most buyers had already purchased enough grain before the February 7 Chinese lunar New Year holiday to take a wait-and-see attitude on prices . 
U.S. Pacific Northwest to Taiwan freight costs were quoted at about US $ 14.00 a tonne and from the Gulf of Mexico between US $ 22.50 and $ 23.50 a tonne , both for Panamax-sized March shipments .
