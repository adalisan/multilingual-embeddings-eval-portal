Portuguese state-owned airline TAP-Air Portugal said it made a first-half loss of 12.3 billion escudos , bigger than the 11.3 billion loss originally forecast in the company &apos;s restructuring plan . 
a spokesman confirmed a report in the daily Diario Economico which attributed the losses to a slump in the number of tourists visiting Portugal this summer . 
during the same period last year TAP posted losses of 14.9 billion escudos . 
the company said it was too early to revise down its forecast for the whole year since July passenger numbers pointed to an increase in business after a very poor June .
