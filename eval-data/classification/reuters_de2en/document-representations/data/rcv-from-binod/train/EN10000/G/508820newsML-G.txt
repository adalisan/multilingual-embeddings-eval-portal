President Nelson Mandela and his predecessor F.W. 
de Klerk , who shared a Nobel prize for bringing democracy to South Africa , on Tuesday warned that their country &apos;s post-apartheid unity was cracking . 
Mandela told parliament in a routine annual debate on his budget that South Africa &apos;s first democratic government had made great strides to improve the lives of the black majority . 
&quot; Yet we are burdened with the legacy of decades , indeed centuries of deliberate division , conflict and hostility . 
it would be a mighty error to imagine that three years could eradicate all trace of what kept us apart for so long . 
&quot; Today , in some ways , the old fault lines in our society are showing more sharply , &quot; he said . 
de Klerk , who freed Mandela from political imprisonment in February 1990 and four years later surrendered power to his African National Congress , appeared to agree . 
&quot; Reconciliation , cooperation and nation building have become central themes of your presidency . 
unfortunately ... objective analysis shows that we are slipping downwards , that we are beginning to lose out , &quot; he said . 
Mandela said he was aware that Afrikaners -- who dominated the final 50 years of white rule -- felt they were being singled out by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission ( TRC ) , which is probing human rights abuses under apartheid . 
but he said that when torturers and killers were called to account it was as individuals and not as Afrikaners . 
&quot; Afrikaners are an inextricable part of our rainbow nation . 
&quot; There is no place for any sense that any racial , ethnic , linguistic , religious or other group is collectively in the dock ... 
it is not in the nature of the Afrikaner as such to be brutal to others . 
&quot; All of us , as a nation that has newly found itself , share in the shame at the capacity of human beings ... to be inhumane to other human beings , &quot; he said . 
former policemen and soldiers , claiming they were doing what their leaders expected of them , have given wrenching testimony of torture , assassination and sexual abuse in the name of apartheid . 
Mandela , who marks his third anniversary as South Africa &apos;s first democratically elected leader on May 10 , has made forgiveness and reconciliation the hallmark of his rule . 
de Klerk , who shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with him , paid tribute to Mandela for his efforts to heal their divided nation , but warned that division was resurfacing . 
&quot; Some cultural and language groups are being threatened and believe that they are being deliberately disadvantaged . 
de Klerk highlighted the work of Archbisop Desmond Tutu &apos;s statutory truth commission . 
&quot; We must find a way to handle the conflict of the past that does not encourage polarisation . 
the current reckless efforts to demonise individuals , organisations and parties directly undermines the reconciliation efforts of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission , &quot; he said . 
de Klerk has repeatedly denied any knowledge of police and military units that tortured and killed anti-apartheid activists during the final decade of white rule . 
but leaders in Mandela &apos;s ANC insist that as president from 1989 to 1994 , de Klerk had to accept responsibility for their actions , which he should have known about . 
warning that &quot; the spirit of reconciliation has dimmed &quot; , de Klerk urged Mandela to renew his commitment to national unity .
