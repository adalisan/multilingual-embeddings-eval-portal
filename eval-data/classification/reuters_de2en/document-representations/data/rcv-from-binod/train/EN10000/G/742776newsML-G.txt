Israeli Foreign Minsiter David Levy said on Monday he would meet Palestinian President Yasser Arafat at a European Union meeting in Brussels on Tuesday . 
&quot; I &apos;ll meet him and we have things to talk about but there isn &apos;t some sort of expectation for the sake of which I &apos;m travelling all the way to Belgium , &quot; he told Israel &apos;s Channel Two news . 
levy met top PLO negotiator Nabil Shaath in Jerusalem on Sunday as part of a European bid to break a four-month-old stalemate in Middle East peacemaking . 
Shaath hailed what he called &quot; a real serious and sincere effort to break the impasse &quot; . 
Israeli-PLO talks , launched with a U.S.-backed interim accord in 1993 , have been stuck since Israel started building a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March , triggering Palestinian protests . 
Tuesday &apos;s meeting at the 15-member European Union &apos;s foreign ministers &apos; meeting will be the highest Israeli-PLO contact since Arafat and Levy met briefly at a Euro-Mediterranean conference in Malta in April in a highly publicised handshake that failed to achieve a breakthrough .
