two construction workers died on Sunday when they jumped off a blazing 36-storey building in central Bangkok and up to 30 were trapped on the top floor , Thai police said . 
police helicopters airlifted at least 40 people to safety and more were being pulled from the building where thick smoke billowed , witnesses said . 
another dozen workers used ropes to climb down from the middle of the smoke-filled building whose construction was nearly complete , they added . 
national Police Chief Pracha Promnok , who was at the scene to direct operations , told Reuters that thick smoke and heat from the blaze , which broke out on the six or seventh floor , was hampering rescue operations . 
&quot; Another 30 workers are trapped on the top floor of the building . 
our police helicopters are conducting rescue operations , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Strong winds and heat and thick smoke from the building are making the rescue job difficult , &quot; he added . 
but he said efforts would continue to rescue all the trapped workers . 
one of the police helicopters used in the rescue had to be withdrawn after one of its propellers broke . 
police said the helicopter had made an emergency landing in a field nearby and all four aboard were safe . 
witnesses saw step-ladders and safety braces being dropped to people waiting to be rescued on the top floor from helicopters which hovered just above the building . 
each helicopter was airlifting one person at a time . 
another 15 workers were injured in the fire , which broke out late in the morning in the building next to a hotel . 
more than 30 fire engines and hundreds of rescue workers and police were at the scene . 
Pracha said the cause of the fire was still not known , but it occurred as workers were laying carpets on the six or seventh floor of the building .
