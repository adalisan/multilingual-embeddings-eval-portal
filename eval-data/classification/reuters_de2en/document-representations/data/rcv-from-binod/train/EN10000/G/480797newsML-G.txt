Africa &apos;s large band of professional footballers are increasingly being caught in a dilemma of club over country as the qualifying campaign for next year &apos;s World Cup clashes with the end of the European season . 
there are more than 250 African footballers who play for first and second division clubs in Europe , from Russia in the east to Portugal in the west , and many of them have to juggle the demands of their employers with the dreams of their countrymen . 
all 20 of the African countries involved in World Cup qualifiers this weekend will be calling back players from Europe just days before vital matches in league and cup competition . 
a poignant example is South African fullback Sizwe Motaung , who will play for his country in a vital World Cup qualifier in the Congo on Sunday and then attempt to dash back to help his Spanish club Tenerife in their UEFA Cup semifinal , first leg match against Schalke O4 of Germany on Tuesday . 
Motaung says it was a tough choice to make and has probably cost him a hard-earned starting berth for the Spanish team which he joined in January . 
his dilemma is shared by countless African players , hard-pressed to keep their places in their club &apos;s first choice side in the wake of repeated travel back to Africa for national team duty . 
this year countries are competing for five World Cup berths in France next year as well as playing qualifying games for 14 places at the African Nations &apos; Cup finals in Burkina Faso next February . 
Bachirou Salou , the Togolese striker who plays in Germany &apos;s Bundesliga for mSv Duisburg , has already made a choice between the two competitions . 
&quot; I cannot afford to play in both the World Cup and Nations &apos; Cup qualifiers , so I &apos;ve decided to only go back and play in the Nations &apos; Cup games where we have a better chance of qualifying , &quot; he said . 
then there are players whose national team places are also at risk because of club demands . 
Egyptian defender Yasser Radwan , another African export to the Bundesliga , has risked losing his place in Egypt &apos;s team for Sunday &apos;s tie against Liberia in neutral Ghana because he has not been able to accede to new coach Mohammed El Gohari &apos;s demand that players join camp 14 days ahead of the game . 
the Confederation of African Football ( CAF ) said it had begun a process of trying to integrate its calendar with that of Europe so as to avoid many of the clashes . 
&quot; We already have several dates of our qualifiers which overlap with those of Europe when the clubs are not playing and the players are free to return home , &quot; said secretary-general Mustapha Fahmy . 
&quot; We hope in the future to regularise even more of these weekends . 
one proposal is for African countries to play their qualifiers in midweek as in Europe , Fahmy added . 
but for the moment African stars still have to tug between patriotism and their monthly pay cheques . 
&quot; It is really the toughest decision I &apos;ve ever had to make , &quot; said Motaung .
