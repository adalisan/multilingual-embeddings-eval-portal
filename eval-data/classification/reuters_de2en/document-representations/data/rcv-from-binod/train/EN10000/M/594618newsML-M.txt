Caracas stocks closed off in a slow session curbed by a liquidity squeeze and troubled by possibly accelerated exchange rate depreciation , traders said . 
&quot; There &apos;s been no liquidity , &quot; said one trader noting that the overnight interbank lending rate had bounced between 10 and 75 percent . 
&quot; There &apos;s also been some exchange rate pressure , with rumors of accelerated depreciation , and that has boosted dollar demand , &quot; he added . 
the Bolsa &apos;s 19-share index closed off 1.26 percent at 6,548.33 percent as 17 million shares traded , worth 3.6 billion bolivars ( $ 7.5 million ) . 
delays in approving electricity tariff increases also put off investors during the day &apos;s skittish trade , brokers said . 
steel company Sivensa led losers , closing off 2.66 percent at 155.75 bolivars as 25 stocks fell , seven rose and two closed flat . 
Merinvest &apos;s composite index , which includes telephone company CANTV , meanwhile fell 1.32 percent to 103.88 points .
