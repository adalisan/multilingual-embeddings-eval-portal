dollar bonds continued to be the favoured Euromarket currency , with three significant transactions launched on Monday . 
Japan-guaranteed Japan Finance Corp for Municipal Enterprises ( JFM ) issued a $ 400 million 10-year bond at 23 basis points over U.S. Treasury notes . 
bankers said the pricing was fair -- with a 10-year Asian Development Bank bond trading at 18 b.p. 
over -- but there was an overhang of supply in the sector . 
&quot; JFM is an attractive deal but some investors have been put off by the large amount of recent supply in 10 years , &quot; a trader at a European bank said . 
&quot; It won &apos;t start to perform for a few days , &quot; he said . 
an official at lead manager Merrill Lynch said despite the large quantity of 10-year paper around , JFM appealed because it was the only government-guaranteed borrower . 
&quot; It has been a long time since a Japan-guaranteed borrower has tapped the market , &quot; the official said . 
&quot; At 23 b.p. 
there has been a lot of interest from Asian investors in particular , with around 50 percent of the bonds placed there . 
Abbey National &apos;s $ 400 million three-year bond was favoured by traders over Hitachi Credit Corp &apos;s $ 200 million five-year bond , which was considered slightly too tight . 
on Tuesday , the Inter-American Development Bank ( IADB ) will issue a $ 500 million five-year bond . 
spread talk was seven basis points over U.S. Treasury notes . 
Dow Chemical could launch a $ 300 million five-year at 31 b.p. 
on Wednesday , Bank Nederlandse Gemeenten might bring a $ 750 million to $ 1.0 billion five-year bond at around 10 b.p. 
over . 
on Thursday , Russia &apos;s 10-year bond for at least $ 1.0 billion is expected to surface . 
spread talk was around 375 b.p. 
over .
