the Australian dollar posted its highest local close since the Reserve Bank cut interest rates last week and although a move to US $ 0.8000 was on the cards , traders said a thin market exaggerated the move upwards . 
while the unit poked its head above the US $ 0.7910 / 50 band that has contained it for the week , it had not made a serious attempt on the US $ 0.7970 level that capped it on Wednesday . 
it was the highest local close since December 10 , the day before the RBA surprised the markets with a 50 basis point reduction in the official cash rate to 6.00 percent . 
&quot; The market was very thin , and a little bit directionless , but obviously there was a bit of demand , &quot; one trader said . 
overseas interest could take the dollar higher , given that support at US $ 0.7910 held in trading on Thursday night and there were U.S. fund buyers seen in the market on Friday , they said . 
there had been demand on the yen cross , traders said , adding the local dollar was boosted by a U.S. dollar above 114 yen . 
on the crosses the Australian dollar ended at 90.89 / 99 yen and 1.2388 / 2400 marks , up from an opening 90.56 / 63 and 1.2370 / 82 and a close on Thursday of 89.99 / 09 and 122.85 / 95 . 
the overnight strength of the U.S. dollar had given the Australian dollar most of its gains , but traders said the fact the Aussie edged higher through the day , exceeding the US $ 0.7958 high seen in New York , was a positive sign for the unit , as were the gains on the crosses . 
on the trade weighted index the Australian dollar rose to 59.2 , its highest close since before the rate cut , up from 59.0 at the open and a previous close of 58.7 . 
traders said that next week was expected to be very quiet , with most books squared ahead of year end . 
there is no major data due until early January and the local foreign exchange market will be closed on Wednesday and Thursday for Christmas , so trade on the other days should be thin , they said .
