Shenzhen &apos;s B shares ended with sharp losses on Tuesday , badly hurt by a poor debut from Bengang Steel plates Co Ltd , which became the year &apos;s first stock to close its first day with losses , analysts said . 
the domestic currency A share index rose 3.92 points or 1.04 percent to 382.27 on a short-term rebound after hitting an intraday low of 361.32 . 
turnover in the A share market was 5.3 billion yuan against Monday &apos;s 4.8 billion . 
&quot; Bengang fell below the offer price because no one wanted to buy shares in China &apos;s lumbering steel sector , &quot; said Peter Ho , an analyst at PBI Securities . 
&quot; The fact that a share ended its debut at a loss indicates a very bearish mood , &quot; Ho said . 
&quot; The share rebounded late in the afternoon as its relatively low P / E generated bargain-hunting , &quot; an analyst at China Southern Securities said . 
the steel company in June completed an initial public offering of 400 million B shares , carrying an earnings multiple of 8.0 times based on fully diluted 1996 per-share net profit of 0.318 yuan under international accounting standards . 
many of China &apos;s state-controlled steel companies , saddled with debt and burdened with bloated workforces , are unable to compete in the marketplace . 
market confidence waned after Hong Kong &apos;s transition to Beijing rule failed to lift indices as expected , analysts said . 
Bengang &apos;s performance pulled other new shares down , with Shandong Chenming Paper Holdings Ltd shedding HK $ 0.37 to HK $ 6.42 on volume of 1.4 million shares . 
China Great Wall Computer Shenzhen was the best A share performer , ending 10 percent limit-up at 24.88 yuan .
