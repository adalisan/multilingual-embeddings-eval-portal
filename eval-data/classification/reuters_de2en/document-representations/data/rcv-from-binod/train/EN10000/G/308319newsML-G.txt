Russian President Boris Yeltsin is recovering from pneumonia but the Kremlin &apos;s top doctor has described his illness as treacherous and urged him to stay in hospital at least to the end of the week . 
the 65-year-old Kremlin leader , reported last Friday to be depressed at falling ill so soon after surviving heart surgery , also faced trouble from political opponents who are trying to kick him out of the Kremlin on health grounds . 
&quot; I should say that this is a fairly serious illness , which of course brings with it a whole range of possible complications , &quot; chief Kremlin doctor Sergei Mironov told a news conference on Wednesday . 
&quot; I think that he should stay in the Central Clinical Hospital ... until the end of this week . 
beyond that it will depend on the course of his illness , &quot; he said . 
he said Yeltsin had wanted to stay in hospital for three days after he was admitted late last Wednesday and though his condition had &quot; stabilised considerably &quot; he had been persuaded that he needed more time there . 
Yeltsin &apos;s opponents , citing the president &apos;s absences from work particularly since his quintuple heart bypass on November 5 , are seeking to carve a path through Russia &apos;s legal labyrinth to remove him from office on health grounds . 
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said his party , the biggest in parliament , would decide on Thursday whether to back moves to oust Yeltsin -- though they are unlikely to succeed . 
&quot; The president last year worked four months -- only during the election campaign -- and on the whole he didn &apos;t focus on government affairs but on promises , &quot; Zyuganov , who lost to Yeltsin in last July &apos;s presidential election , told reporters . 
&quot; For any citizen of the country it raises the question : &apos; Why isn &apos;t there any leadership in the country ? 
but Mironov , referring to Russian labour law which counts a period of sickness from the date when an invalid last worked , said Yeltsin had officially only been off work for a week . 
Yeltsin at first had been confined to bed but was now working on documents , he said . 
&quot; Sometimes he gets up at 3.30 , 4 o &apos;clock and works on documents and then three hours later he might sleep for another hour and a half . 
&quot; Of course we try to limit his workload because the illness he now has is quite treacherous , &quot; he said . 
one big complication such a patient could develop was waterlogging in the lungs , or pulmonary oedema , Mironov said . 
&quot; It was one of the reasons he was taken to hospital , because it is a very dangerous situation , especially with double pneumonia , &quot; he said , referring to inflammation in both lungs . 
the doctor also spoke of potential deterioration in the heart muscle due to the pneumonia , which had also been avoided . 
&quot; But of course the illness leaves its mark on all organs and systems and lung disease , of course , is close and linked to cardiac problems , &quot; he added . 
Russian debt prices slumped to their lowest for a month and traders said the market would remain volatile until more was known about Yeltsin &apos;s illness , which comes on top of heart problems which kept him from the Kremlin for six months . 
the threat from Yeltsin &apos;s opponents looked set to continue . 
Communist Viktor Ilyukhin , head of parliament &apos;s security committee , said he would press for a vote on Friday to force Yeltsin out , though experts said this would have no legal force . 
the constitution is vague on removing an ailing head of state , saying only that the president &quot; ceases his functions &quot; if his health is too weak , without specifying who would decide .
