is Michael Jackson , the self-styled &quot; King of Pop , &quot; now a Papa ? 
one Los Angeles television station reported that Jackson &apos;s wife told them she had a baby boy on Wednesday , but other news reports said the woman , Debbie Rowe , had been admitted to the famed Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre but had not yet given birth . 
spokesmen for the reclusive singer would not confirm Rowe was even at the hospital , but promised a statement shortly . 
in a call to KNBC , a woman identifying herself as Rowe , who Jackson married three months ago , said the baby was born after doctors had induced labour . 
&quot; Debbie Rowe called us just literally two minutes before we went on the air this afternoon ( 7 p.m. est ) to tell us &apos; yes indeed &apos; she had a little baby , a baby boy , &quot; KNBC anchor Chuck Henry said on the air . 
&quot; I asked her how the child was doing and she said &apos; he &apos;s doing fine and she &apos;s doing fine , &quot; &apos; said Henry . 
after doubts were raised about KNBC &apos;s report , the station &apos;s news director Bill Lord told Reuters : &quot; We believe the woman who called was Debbie Rowe . 
we believe what we reported is correct . 
security was tight around the hospital and a spokesman for Cedars-Sinai declined to even confirm the couple was there . 
recent reports had said Rowe , who married Jackson in Australia less than a year after his divorce from Lisa Marie Presley , would give birth at a clinic in Switzerland . 
her due date was mid-February . 
the couple married last November only 10 days after Jackson announced that Rowe , who worked for the star &apos;s dermatologist and nursed him while he was being treated for a rare skin disorder , was to give birth to his child . 
Jackson denied news reports that Rowe had been artificially inseminated and that he paid her $ 500,000 to carry his child . 
this is second time that Jackson -- known for a bizarre fantasy lifestyle surrounded by children , pet chimpanzees and other animals -- has been married in secret . 
when Lisa Marie , daughter of late rock &apos; n &apos; roll legend Elvis Presley , filed for divorce 20 months after they were married in the Dominican Republic , she cited &quot; irreconcilable differences .
