gold prices firmed by around 50 cents an ounce in early European trade on Tuesday on news that the U.S. had struck targets in southern Iraq . 
but prices were stabilising and room to rise was limited unless the conflict widened , dealers said . 
&quot; We are seeing buying from the Far East because of the U.S. strikes in Iraq , &quot; one dealer at a major Swiss bank said , noting the price had advanced to around $ 387.50 . 
&quot; If the conflict does not escalate , prices are not likely to gain much . 
but now we have to wait and see , &quot; he added . 
in Hong Kong , gold edged up slightly minutes after the U.S. launched the missile strikes , gold traders said . 
&quot; People are a little bit nervous , &quot; said Anderson Cheung , chief dealer at Swiss Bank Corporation , but he added that no major moves were expected . 
&quot; People remember 1991 , &quot; Cheung said , noting that the market &apos;s experience during the Gulf War -- when gold prices soared and then collapsed -- had tempered any extreme reaction . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see gold at $ 400 because of this , &quot; another dealer at a big Swiss bank said , noting several traders still remembered how they lost lots of money by going long in gold during the Gulf War . 
&quot; No one wants to be short and have to explain to management why you are short when the United States just attacked Iraq , &quot; he added . 
but he said many traders saw the assault in the context of the U.S. election campaign and were not overly concerned . 
traders said they were watching to see whether U.S. funds would pile into gold and trigger follow-on buying in Europe . 
the U.S. military on Tuesday launched cruise missile strikes against air defence targets in Iraq in retaliation for Iraqi military attackes against the Kurds , the Pentagon said . 
the news had little impact in other metals markets , although traders and analysts said they would watch for further developments . 
on the London Metal Exchange , copper eased by around $ 31 to $ 1,995 ahead of an expected increase in stocks in its warehouses . 
prices had raced sharply higher on Monday .
