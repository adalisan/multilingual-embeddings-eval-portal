President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo offered on Thursday to appoint a minister to work with international agencies on repatriating Rwandan refugees , U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said . 
Annan told a news conference that Kabila , who has renamed the former Zaire since taking power last month , had made the offer at a private meeting on the fringes of an Organisation of African Unity summit being held in Harare . 
&quot; He has agreed to do that , &quot; he said when asked whether it was true Kabila would appoint a contact minister in his administration to handle the refugee crisis , including helping to facilitate investigations of alleged human rights abuses . 
&quot; What is important here is that I have had a very useful discussion with him and he has realised the importance of the issue , the urgency of the issue and is going to cooperate on the treatment of the refugees , the assistance of the refugees and the investigation , &quot; he said . 
Annan discussed the refugee crisis in the Great Lakes district of central Africa with a number of OAU delegates including President Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda . 
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told reporters in New York that Kabila , who assumed power early last month after his rebel forces drove out former Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko , also asked for U.N. assistance for reconstruction . 
he said Annan agreed to help , but urged Kabila to broaden his transitional government , which does not include some popular opposition figures . 
the U.N. has clashed with Kabila over allegations that his Tutsi-dominated forces had massacred some refugees and was deliberately abusing others . 
the refugees are remnants of 1.1 million Hutus who fled Rwanda in 1994 to escape reprisals for the genocide of an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus . 
some 815,000 have returned home since last November , while 46,000 have been found and about 247,000 remain unaccounted for , according to UNHCR . 
Kabila &apos;s Information Minister Raphael Ghenda said in Kinshasa on Wednesday there was no evidence Rwandan Hutu refugees were being massacred in Congo as relief agencies have alleged . 
referring to a failed earlier bid to investigate allegations of massacres and abuse , Annan said in Harare : &quot; We are looking at a fresh start . 
addressing the opening session of the OAU summit on Monday , Annan asked Kabila directly to allow access to the weak and displaced for humanitarian agencies . 
&quot; It is necessary even now that the protection of human life , the full respect of human life , is given the highest priority and that the rule of law should quickly return to that country .
