Brazil &apos;s Chamber of Deputies approved two amendments to a civil service reform bill Wednesday but left amendments on sensitive points for another date , officials said . 
more than 100 amendments to the bill have been presented by opposition and government lawmakers . 
the government angered many members of the lower house earlier this week when it withdrew its support from a controversial amendment which would have exempted lawmakers from a proposed 10,800 reais ( $ 10,118 ) ceiling on pay and pension . 
the government supported the two amendments approved earlier . 
voting on the other proposals is due to resume next week .
