demand for at-the-money and upside copper call options emerged this week on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) both for nearby months and well into 1997 . 
business picked up slightly from the very low levels of recent weeks , but trade was still generally slow , options dealers said . 
&quot; We saw buying of copper calls for any month this year , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; But volumes have been nothing spectacular . 
&quot; There has been buying of nearby copper calls and further forward on the upside , &quot; said another . 
activity on nearby months centred on $ 2,000-a-tonne September call buying as market makers covered their exposure ahead of the September declaration on Wednesday . 
&quot; I would guess this is mostly cover against short Asian option positions in the market , &quot; said a trader . 
several options traders said they did not expect to see much underlying price volatility at declaration , despite market talk of an options-related price spike next Wednesday . 
people are long of these traded options against being short of the Asians , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; If you &apos;re sensible you would lock in your $ 2,000 cover today . 
there &apos;s not too much going on after that , &quot; another added . 
forward call buying was for $ 2,100 and $ 2,200 strikes during the first half of 1997 and into the third quarter . 
volatilities firmed across the board this week having fallen sharply since the highs in June . 
September was quoted at 22.5 percent volatility early on Friday from 20.5 a week ago . 
November traded up to 23.5 percent on Thursday from 22.5 percent last Friday . 
average 1997 was quoted at 20 / 22 percent volatility . 
several dealers said huge short option positions on the over-the-counter ( OTC ) market continued to overhang the copper futures market , helping to keep it in a very narrow range . 
big players , including banks , are said to be keeping the market in a tight range in order to protect their options exposure . 
&quot; There has been bank selling at the top of the range and bank buying at the bottom . 
this forces down option values and protects their exposure , &quot; said one trader . 
another said part of Sumitomo Corp &apos;s strategy in base metals was also to grant large tonnages of options , and this may still be having an impact on copper prices . 
&quot; I think Sumitomo shorts are still overhanging the market somewhat on the options market , &quot; he said . 
so far the strategy appears to be working , with nearby volatilities falling sharply in recent weeks as three month futures remained locked between $ 1,905 and $ 1,970 a tonne . 
aluminium options trade centred on selling of September options as prices stuck to a narrow band and further buying of average 1997 upside calls . 
traders said the 1997 options were on strikes at $ 1,700 , $ 1,800 and even $ 1,900 , and reflected people &apos;s bullish long-term outlook for the metal . 
volatilities were quoted at 18 to 18.50 percent for the average , well above nearby values . 
September was indicated around 12.5 percent volatility early on Friday against 13 percent a week ago . 
nickel , zinc , lead and tin option volatilities all eased on nearby months this week in slow conditions . 
both zinc and lead volatilities could go even lower soon . 
&quot; Everyone is long of zinc options and the market is just not moving . 
no-one wants them , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; The same thing could also happen on lead .
