the Beluga whale , the huge , white mammal with the enigmatic smile , is in danger of disappearing from the St. Lawrence River because of pollution . 
&quot; For us , it is without question a species on the road to disappearing , &quot; said Nathalie Boudreau , research assistant at the Groupe de Recherche et d &apos;Education sur les Mammiferes Marins ( GREMM ) , an independent research group . 
their numbers devastated by hunting , wanton slaughter and contamination of large areas of their habitat , only 500 Belugas still travel the lower third of the 1,200-mile ( 2,000 km ) St. Lawrence River , which stretches from Lake Erie to the Atlantic Ocean . 
a century ago , there were an estimated 5,000 in its frigid waters . 
now Boudreau and other researchers worry that although the Beluga population in the St. Lawrence stabilised in the 1980s it is no longer growing despite international efforts to protect the whale and clean up its polluted environment . 
&quot; What is not normal is that even though there are Beluga births each year , the population is not growing , &quot; she said . 
the great scourge of the St. Lawrence Belugas is pollution from industries and towns nestled along the great river . 
industries dump chemicals and toxins into the river , while many towns and villages , lacking sewage treatment facilities , use the St. Lawrence as a vast septic tank . 
the lower St. Lawrence takes in pollution from the Great Lakes , but Quebec cannot put all the blame on other Canadian provinces and its American neighbours . 
fully 80 percent of Quebec &apos;s 7.3 million population lives near the great river . 
researchers believe most of the Belugas suffer from cancers affecting intestines , stomach , uterus , blood vessels , brain or lungs . 
Belugas must also cope with weakened immune systems and fertility problems . 
suspected carcinogens and heavy metals are found in significant concentrations in their bodies , as are pesticides . 
&quot; The Beluga is a pollution indicator for the St. Lawrence . 
it accumulates heavy metals at the bottom of the river by eating shrimp , eels and fish , &quot; Boudreau said . 
last year , a team of officials from the World Wildlife Federation , Canada &apos;s department of Fisheries and Oceans and local ecologists established a plan to revive the Beluga population , but early results provide little hope that their numbers can be boosted in the St. Lawrence . 
the governments of Quebec and Canada are teaming up to create a National Sea Park near Tadoussac , about 140 miles ( 225 km ) northwest of Quebec City . 
in 1993 , Environment Canada created &quot; St. Lawrence-Vision 2000 , &quot; a development plan that would give Quebec residents better access to a cleaner river by 1998 . 
the plan targets polluters and calls for a gradual reduction of industrial waste dumped into the river . 
&quot; Toxic substances have diminished in the St. Lawrence and there has been a clear improvement in the quality of its water , &quot; Environment Canada spokesman Alain Petit said . 
&quot; As a result we think the Belugas are ingesting fewer contaminants . 
Beluga is the Russian word for &quot; white . 
&quot; An average Beluga whale weighs between 1,750 and 2,650 pounds ( 800-1,200 kg ) , measures 15 feet ( 4.5 metres ) and lives 30 years . 
most of the world &apos;s 55,000 Belugas are found in the waters around the Arctic Circle near Alaska , northern Canada , Scandinavia and Russia . 
Belugas have lived in the St. Lawrence for 12,000 years , attracted by its cold water . 
Whale-watching is both a boon and a bane for the St. Lawrence Beluga , known in local circles as the &quot; ambassador of Tadoussac . 
&quot; A village of 860 people founded in 1600 , Tadoussac is host to nearly 500,000 visitors each year . 
most come to see the whales , including the Blue whale and the sperm whale . 
they also delight in spotting friendly-looking Belugas , although Canadian law prohibits specific sightseeing of the species . 
while tourist interest helps motivate local residents to protect the whales , the proliferation of tourist boats in the area is further endangering the fragile Beluga population . 
Boudreau &apos;s research group wants a moratorium on cruises and boating in Tadoussac Bay and parts of the St. Lawrence , something Tadoussac &apos;s mayor , Thomas Mahe , does not oppose . 
we are having trouble in managing all this growth in tourism , &quot; Mahe said .
