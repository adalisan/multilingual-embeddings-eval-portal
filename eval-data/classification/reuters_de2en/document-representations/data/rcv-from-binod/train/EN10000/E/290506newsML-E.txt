Deputy Governor of the Bank of England Howard Davies said on Tuesday that UK rates would need to rise soon if the government is to meet its inflation target . 
&quot; It is no secret the Bank of England believes that interest rates will need to rise in the near future if we are to remain on course to meet the government &apos;s inflation target of 2.5 percent or less , &quot; he said in a speech prepared for delivery at the Oxford Farming Conference . 
but he said if the rise comes soon , it need only be modest . 
&quot; The rise needed now to give us a better than evens chance of remaining below 2.5 percent inflation next year is relatively modest . 
he added he did not see interest rates returning to levels seen in the 1980s or early 1990s . 
turning to European monetary union , Davies said if Britain decided to remain outside a single European currency it would not necessarily pose a threat to the UK &apos;s recent track record of lower inflation . 
&quot; There is no reason why , whether in or out of EMU , the future should be like the ( high inflation ) past , &quot; he said , noting that only in the past four years has Britain &apos;s inflation performance improved radically . 
prior to that , Britain had consistently suffered from more volatile inflation and exchanged rates than in most of continental Europe , he said . 
&quot; If we can continue to control our domestic inflation more tightly , then in future we can expect a more stable financial environment in general , with less exchange rate volatility , less volatility in interest rates .
