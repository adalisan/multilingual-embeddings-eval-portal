Taiwan share prices closed sharply higher on Thursday as investors cheered the government &apos;s decision not to raise the business income tax , brokers said . 
the weighted index , which gained steadily through much of the session , ended 73.34 points or 1.12 percent higher at 6,611.58 . 
the finance ministry said on Thursday it planned to keep the business income tax at 25 percent after a reform merging the island &apos;s personal income and business income taxes , abandoning a drive to set the combined rate at 35 percent . 
final approval of the tax level is due on October 11 . 
&quot; The news gave the market a definite boost , as most businesses had been against the tax rise , &quot; said Michael hung of Nikko Securities . 
&quot; But it remains to be seen how the the government decides to make up the lost tax revenue . 
the government had said it would suffer a reduction of up to T $ 26.8 billion in tax revenues due to the tax merger . 
the cement sector gained 2.31 percent on bargain-hunting . 
Polyester-making firms soared on widespread expectations of rising international demand , especially from China . 
brokers said some local buying was inspired by Wall Street &apos;s record high overnight close . 
&quot; The Wall Street high contributed to strengthening an overall sanguine atmosphere for the local market , &quot; said Lin Long-hsien of United Securities . 
brokers expect the index to trend higher in the near term . 
investors will watch closely the performance of individual firms as the October 31 deadline approaches for firms to release profit and sales totals for the first three quarters of 1996 . 
&quot; Now that the index has broken a resistance at 6,600 , it should have more upside momentum to grow , &quot; Nikko &apos;s hung said .
