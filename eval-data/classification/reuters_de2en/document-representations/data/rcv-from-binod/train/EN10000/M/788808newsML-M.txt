U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices were seen mostly steady with a firm tone , amid outlooks for light movement Friday , livestock dealers said . 
prices also could be underpinned by firm demand , with at least one major packer seen slaughtering again Saturday at two or three plants after cutting hours last week , they said . 
slaughter Saturday was estimated near 30,000 head versus 4,000 last Saturday and 20,000 a year ago , sources said . 
Marketings were seen lighter now that farmers have cuaght up with moving hogs not sold during last week &apos;s light sales , sources said . 
Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota hogs were seen steady , with a top of $ 57.00 at plants , they said . 
Illinois hogs also were seen steady , with a top of $ 56.00 at the plant , but could firm if demand is greater than expected , dealers said . 
&quot; The run was not as big as we thought today and could be light tomorrow ( Friday ) , &quot; one central Illinois hog buyer said . 
Indian / Ohio top prices for hogs delivered to the plant were expected steady at $ 57.00 .
