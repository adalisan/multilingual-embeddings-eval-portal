French bond futures drifted lower in a nervous session buffeted by the moves in the United States but found strong support at 128.12 , a level the contract touched several times during the day . 
the mood at the short end of the curve was more upbeat . 
PIBOR contracts started well , reacting to a Bank of France monetary policy council member &apos;s calls late on Tuesday for aggressive rate cuts , independently of German . 
traders said the move prompted some short covering before PIBOR contracts got another boost from people betting on positive statements on interest rates from President Chirac . 
&quot; People are positioning themselves for a punt , &quot; an analyst at a French bank said . 
&quot; I doubt anything &apos;s really going to happen but giving the political misgivings about interest rate policy why not at least be long of the short end ? 
he said PIBOR remained well supported by the fact interest rates would stay low whatever Chirac might say in a television interview at 1950 GMT this evening . 
&quot; You won &apos;t lose much , but there might be a surprise , &quot; he said . 
some said similar caution ahead of the broadcast was weighing slightly on the franc which moved as low as 3.3843 against the mark from 3.3788 late on Wednesday . 
however others said the franc weakness was more the result of people buying dollars for francs in an otherwise light market . 
one said concern about calls for a rail strike from Communist-led union CGT might be having an affect . 
the Chirac speech was not seen as having any lasting impact however . 
most said he would reaffirm the need to follow the current policies aimed at getting the country in shape for European monetary union . 
&quot; I think he &apos;ll underline his commitment to Europe and his commitment to internal security , &quot; Iain Lindsay , senior bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais said . 
&quot; He &apos;s unlikely to say revolutionary things in such an interview , &quot; Philippe Brossard , head of research at ABN AMRO in Paris , said . 
analysts said the French bond market remained tolerably well supported by domestic investors , which continued to lead to slight outperformance when other bond markets declined . 
the 10-year spread between French and German bond yields moved out to minus eight basis points from minus six on Wednesday , 
&quot; We still see the spread turning even more negative every time the markets move down , &quot; Brossard said . 
as expected the Bank of France left the intervention rate unchanged after its bi-weekly monetary policy council meeting . 
the Treasury sold 335 million Ecu of government bonds at auction with a total bid to cover ratio of 4.7 .
