Russian MinFin bonds rose on Thursday amid optimism about Russia &apos;s new Eurobond and Moscow &apos;s plans to close an agreement with the London Club of commercial creditors , dealers said . 
but they said the rise was muted by weaker U.S. treasuries . 
tranche June 19 June 18 
1999 maturity ( 3 ) 90.10-90.30 89.95-90.20 
2003 maturity ( 4 ) 66.80-67.00 66.40-66.65 
2008 maturity ( 5 ) 47.90-48.10 47.50-47.75 
2006 maturity ( 6 ) 53.90-54.10 53.65-53.90 
2011 maturity ( 7 ) 41.80-42.00 41.65-41.90 
&quot; The market is still strong , but we could see some profit-taking today , &quot; Eurobank dealer Olivier Coursault said . 
&quot; The Eurobond issue is long-awaited and could not push up prices at these levels . 
Russia raised $ 2.0 billion , twice the amount originally expected , in the international capital markets with the launch of a 10-year Eurobond . 
dealers said earlier MinFin prices had firmed briefly by 0.25-0.40 points after the news . 
dealers said Thursday &apos;s U.S. mixed statistics was another braking factor for MinFins . 
&quot; Figures on jobless claims were good for U.S. interest rates but there was some disappointment with the Philadelphia survey , &quot; Coursault said . 
the U.S. Labour Department said on Thursday that weekly jobless claims rose to 347,000 in the week ended June 14 . 
claims stood at 339,000 the week before . 
U.S. Stocks and bonds eased after the Philadelphia Federal Reserve &apos;s June business activity index came in at 25.2 , up from 1.6 in May . 
economists had expected a reading of 7.3 . 
MinFins , like other emerging debt , are sensitive to any news which would suggest a change in U.S. interest rates and consequently affect U.S. Treasury bond prices . 
dealers said news that Russia plans to close an agreement with the London Club of commercial bank creditors by August 15 , 1997 , was also widely anticipated and had little impact on prices . 
&quot; This kind of news could have been bullish if it had come out in the middle of July , &quot; Coursault said . 
&quot; But we are now in the period of position-squaring ahead of half-year and we can see some profit-taking for this reason .
