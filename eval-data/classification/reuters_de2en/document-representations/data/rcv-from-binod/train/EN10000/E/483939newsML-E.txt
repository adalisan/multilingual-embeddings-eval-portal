Bank of England Governor Eddie George admitted on Thursday that a rise in official interest rates would hurt British exporters but said the pace of domestic demand requires some monetary tightening . 
&quot; Such policy dilemmas do arise from time to time , &quot; George told the Foreign Bankers Association , gathered in Amsterdam . 
&quot; But you cannot reasonably expose the economy as a whole to inflationary risks in order to protect the tradable sectors . 
George said the appreciation of the pound -- up about 20 percent against the core European currencies in the last six months -- was a largely reversible influence . 
&quot; But while the abnormal strength of sterling persists , a firming of our monetary policy would clearly be unwelcome to UK exporters . 
&quot; As the pound rises , so do exporters &apos; prices . 
that has dampened demand abroad for British goods . 
base rates were edged up to six percent from 5.75 on October 30 last year . 
George has argued for a further increase in all of his monthly monetary meetings with Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke this year -- but to no avail . 
with national elections due on May 1 , a tightening can be ruled out at least for the next month or so . 
&quot; It is undeniably uncomfortable while the dilemma persists , because of the implications for the domestic / external balance of the economy , even though in aggregate the prospect of continuing steady growth with relatively low inflation remains , &quot; George said . 
he also signalled that the Bank of England was not obsessed with the government &apos;s 2.5 percent target for underlying inflation as long as price pressures remained subdued . 
underlying retail price inflation , excluding home loan payments , was 2.9 percent in the year to February . 
&quot; What we are seeking to achieve more fundamentally is to maintain monetary stability in the much broader sense of avoiding ... the emergence of imbalance between monetary demand in the economy and the supply-side capacity of that economy to meet that demand . 
turning to Europe , George repeated the Bank &apos;s line that forcing European economic and monetary union through on its January 1 , 1999 deadline was fraught with danger . 
but he stressed that Britain &apos;s reservations about EMU in no way reflected a desire to take a macro-economic soft option . 
Britain remains committed to monetary and fiscal sustainability as demanded by the Maastricht Treaty . 
and if Britain decides to stay out , it will be crucial to persevere with those economic disciplines , he said . 
&quot; What really puzzles me is why anyone should want to risk joining the euro area unless they were genuinely convinced that the economic risks had been minimised through sustainable convergence , &quot; George said . 
there must be no slippage of the single currency criteria , he said . 
&quot; My sympathies remain with those who emphasise the importance of sustainable convergence rather than the calendar . 
but given the political will for EMU to start on time , George said the &quot; prudent planning assumption &quot; was still that there would be no delay . 
George said there was no case for discriminating against countries who opted not to sign up for the single currency and saw no threat to London &apos;s pre-eminent position among Europe &apos;s financial centres . 
&quot; Provided we are prepared , as we will be , to quote , trade and settle in euro ... then I am convinced that broader markets in euro instruments will represent an opportunity rather than a threat to the City . 
&quot; I can understand the emotion that &quot; we don &apos;t want our currency to be actively traded in their market &apos; but I am bound to say it strikes me as outdated , flying in the face of financial globalisation .
