the United States on Wednesday condemned the murder of 93 civilians in Algeria by Moslem rebels as vicious and the work of &quot; genocidal terrorists . 
using some of the toughest language issued by the State Department on the issue of terrorist violence , spokesman Nicholas Burns refused to repeat the U.S. call for a dialogue between the fundamentalists and the government . 
&quot; It &apos;s very difficult to see how you can speak to cynical , brutal genocidal terrorists like these people , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s hard to remember a more vicious terrorist insurgency than this one , a more cynical group than these Islamic terrorists and they deserve special criticism and condemnation by the world community for these despicable acts , &quot; Burns said . 
&quot; They are not going after government targets or soldiers . 
they are going after innocent civilians in the villages ... the most brutal type of terrorism , &quot; he added . 
Algeria &apos;s government reported on Tuesday that Moslem rebels killed 93 people in an overnight raid on a village south of Algiers , leaving their bodies lying in blood after cutting their throats or hacking them to death with farm implements . 
the death toll , which included 43 women and girls , was the highest in a single attack on villagers in more than five years of conflict in which Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas have been fighting to try to topple the government .
