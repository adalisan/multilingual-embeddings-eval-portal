Hungary &apos;s Government Debt Management Agency ( AKK ) said it expects government securities yields to continue to decline , despite an interruption to the trend with a central bank interest rate hike in March . 
&quot; The market has stabilised and we expect the ( earlier ) trend to continue , &quot; AKK deputy director Maria Dunavolgyi told a news conference on Thursday . 
the National Bank of Hungary raised its six-month deposit rate by 0.25 to 21 percent in March to protect savings from an interest rate decline , which it regarded as too rapid . 
following the rate hike , an auction of 40 billion forints worth of three-year government bonds was more than 90 percent undersubscribed , with buyers seeking yields higher than offered . 
the rate hike also led to a fall in demand for government bonds and strengthened interest in buying discount Treasury bills , which have up to one year maturity . 
after failure of the three-year bond auction , AKK increased its six-month and 12-month Treasury bill offeringsand hopes to make up the delay in government security sales by the mid-June at latest , officials said . 
AKK deputy director Laszlo Borbely said most government bond auctions since the failed three-year bond auction have been oversubscribed and bids for a new bond auction for the same maturity on Thursday almost doubled the offered amount . 
AKK said its bond offering plans for the next few months were unlikely to change but the agency may offer fewer seven-year bonds as demand for them was low .
