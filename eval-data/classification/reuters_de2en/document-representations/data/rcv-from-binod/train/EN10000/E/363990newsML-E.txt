the Clinton administration said on Thursday that the nearly six-year-old U.S. economic expansion could continue for some time . 
in its fiscal 1998 budget proposal , the administration argued that the economy has a lot going for it , notably that inflation is under control , employment is on the rise , interest rates are trending down and monetary and fiscal policy is prudent . 
the current expansion , which began in April 1991 , is already the third longest this century . 
if it continues through December 1998 , it will become the century &apos;s longest peacetime upswing . 
if it lasts 14 months more than that , it would surpass the record 106-month exapnsion of the 1960 &apos;s . 
&quot; This expansion certainly has the potential to enter the record books , &quot; the administration said . 
it added that it believes that the full employment rate for the U.S. economy is now well below the six percent rate that many economists had pegged it just a few years ago . 
in its budget , the administration said it assumes that the full employment rate -- or the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment ( NAIRU ) -- is 5.5 percent .
