the dollar , riding high on world foreign exchange markets , is expected to drop back versus the mark and yen as market focus switches to fundamentals , a Reuters survey showed on Tuesday . 
by mid-1997 the dollar is expected to fall to 117.72 yen and 1.6463 marks , the mean of 16 forecasts collected on Tuesday showed . 
by end-1997 the dollar is seen trading at 113.80 yen and 1.6167 marks . 
this compares with the dollar &apos;s levels in Europe on Tuesday at a 47-month high versus the yen at around 120.75 and a 31-month high of around 1.6565 against the mark . 
&quot; We expect to see a slowdown in the U.S. later this year . 
stronger growth in Europe should underpin the mark and potentially German rates are headed higher , &quot; said Adam Chester , bond strategist at Yamaichi . 
&quot; We don &apos;t think the Bank of Japan would want to see dollar / yen go decisively through 120 . 
intervention is emerging at these levels to push the dollar lower &quot; . 
the decline in the dollar against the yen is expected to be gradual but steady , according to the Reuters poll . 
by end-March , the dollar is expected to fall below 120 yen to 118.88 and by end-September , it is forecast to reach 116.00 . 
&quot; We &apos;re coming up to March for the Japanese year-end . 
the yen will strengthen a little as repatriation comes through , &quot; said David Hurd , a corporate dealer at Svenska Handelsbanken . 
&quot; I &apos;m also not expecting any more liberalisation of the economy and this will push the yen up later this year &quot; . 
against the mark , the dollar &apos;s decline is expected to be slower . 
by the end of the first quarter of 1997 it is forecast at 1.6466 and by the end of the third quarter it is likely to fall to 1.6393 marks , the forecasts showed . 
Jeremy Hawkins , chief economist Europe at Bank of America , expects dollar / yen to rise to 125 before falling off to 112 by the end of this year . 
&quot; The weakness in the Nikkei and the ongoing softness in the economy means that low interest rates are here for a while &quot; . 
fiscal and monetary policies in the United States , Japan and Germany are other reasons given for the dollar &apos;s reversal . 
&quot; In the second quarter of 1997 , we are probably entering a period of monetary tightening in the United States , &quot; said Philip Shaw , economist at UBS . 
&quot; The main problem is the tight labour market and the Federal Reserve wanting to cool the pace of activity in the economy . 
they will also want to keep a lid on inflationary pressures &quot; . 
over the last two years , after the dollar fell below 80 in April 1995 to a post-war low against the yen , Japan &apos;s trade surplus with the United States has been declining . 
but many economists now believe that trend is about to reverse and the trade friction that is expected to follow will help the dollar to fall back against the yen . 
on a longer-term scale , Peter Von Maydell believes the mark has another couple of years to go through a multi-year correction against the dollar . 
he forecasts the dollar at 1.7500 marks from end-March to end-December . 
&quot; After unification , fiscal policy was loosened and monetary policy tightened . 
it is the other way round now because they have to deal with their structural budget deficit . 
the policy mix will remain as it is for a couple of years .
