foreign direct investment in the former communist world topped $ 46 billion at mid-1996 , up 60 percent from a year earlier , with countries that are reforming faster getting the lion &apos;s share , a U.N. report said on Tuesday . 
Hungary ranked number one in foreign direct investment in transitional economies with a cumulative $ 13.9 billion , followed by Poland with $ 9.1 billion , the report by the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) said . 
the ECE , a specialised United Nations agency for economic cooperation in Europe , said Hungary now accounted for 30 percent of total foreign direct investments in the ex-communist world , followed by Poland with a 17 percent share . 
Russia came the third with a 13 percent share , beating the Czech republic into fourth place with 12 percent . 
overall , Hungary , the Czech Republic , Poland , the Slovak Republic and Slovenia received nearly 70 percent of the total . 
although tiny by Western standards , the per capita share of foreign direct investment in transitional economies more than doubled to $ 135 at the start of 1996 from $ 60 at the start of 1994 , the ECE said . 
this is way below some $ 1,800 in per capita foreign direct investment in the United States but is more than Brazil &apos;s $ 130 and around $ 110 in China , it said . 
at the bottom of the league , per capita foreign investment was just $ 17 in Ukraine and $ 20 in Moldova . 
in the former Soviet Union , Russia led foreign direct investments with $ 6.6 billion as of 1996 , said the report . 
in contrast , Moldova and Belarus had received just $ 104 million and $ 350 million , respectively . 
Western Europe accounted for the bulk of foreign direct investment in the former Soviet Union , with a share of 80 percent in Belarus , up to 70 in Russia and up to 60 in Estonia , Ukraine and Latvia but only 17 percent in oil-rich Kazakhstan . 
in Kazakhstan , U.S. investors led the way with a share of 66 percent worth $ 1.8 billion in direct investments at the start of 1996 , mainly in the oil industry . 
Kazakhstan , a landlocked country stretching from the Chinese border to the east to the Urals in the west , more than doubled the volume of foreign direct investments to $ 3.24 billion in mid-1996 , compared with in early 1994 , the report said . 
the republic now had more than 800 foreign investors , compared with only 14 in 1992 , and the number was growing by several hundred every year . 
more than 27,000 Kazakhs now worked for foreign companies or joint ventures , compared with around 6,400 in early 1993 , the report added .
