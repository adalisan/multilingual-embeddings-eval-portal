trading in the Singapore rubber market was quiet on Monday except for a solitary deal for RSS3 rubber in the ring session , dealers said . 
&quot; Somebody was closing their position and hit the spot July contract for 100 tonnes . 
that was the only piece of business this morning . 
there was nothing else done , &quot; a dealer said . 
dealers said the market was looking for leads going into the afternoon session in otherwise slow trading conditions . 
prices were indicated at lower levels as a result of easier prices in Japan , the traders said . 
the key November contract in Tokyo shed 1.2 yen to reach 132.0 in the morning session . 
&quot; The major consumers are not in the market so far , but I wouldn &apos;t be surprised if they &apos;re checking prices to see if an opportunity will present itself , &quot; a dealer said . 
at 0445 GMT , August RSS3 was indicated at 111.50 U.S. cents a kg from last Friday &apos;s settlement of 112.50 cents . 
August RSS1 was indicated at 160.00 Singapore cents ( US $ 1.12 ) a kg from 161.25 cents . 
July TSR20 was indicated at 147.50-149.50 Singapore cents ( US $ 1.03- $ 1.05 ) a kg from 149.50 cents .
