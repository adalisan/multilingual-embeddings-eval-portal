leading Russian shares changed little on Monday in lethargic trading on weak Western support , traders said . 
the Russian Trading System index of 23 shares slipped by 1.15 percent to 295.61 on $ 18.56 million in total market volume . 
&quot; The market is very soft without Western support , &quot; said UFG trader Maxim Perlin . 
&quot; If there is demand it is unable to change the situation . 
the market is now moved by two major factors : expectations of big Western orders and corporate news , which only cause purely technical changes . 
traders said the results of Mosenergo power utility announced at today &apos;s shareholders &apos; meeting were positive for the market , but had little impact . 
Mosenergo shareholders &apos; meeting decided to consider increasing authorised capital in the future but not in the next two to three months . 
the meeting approved a 50 rouble dividend for 1996 , unchanged from 1995 . 
the approved net profit to Russian cash accounting standards was 2.8 trillion roubles afer 2.4 trillion in 1995 . 
the company said it hoped to get a Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s rating for its $ 150 million Eurobond issue in May . 
Mosenergo fell to $ 1.255 from $ 1.293 at Friday &apos;s closing and national power utility UES dropped to $ 0.2162 from $ 0.2215 . 
Perlin said he did not expect the market to move strongly in the near future . 
&quot; I think prices are quite stable and no correction will be seen , &quot; he said . 
Bank Menatep securities &apos; department head Sergei Kosynkin said there was some demand in most volatile shares , like Mosenergo , UES and LUKOIL and attributed it to Western speculative demand after mid-day price falls . 
&quot; But they are still busy with their Dow Jones , that &apos;s why the orders are very small , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Although I do not rule out that tomorrow the market will be a bit more active , we are not accustomed to keeping the market at the same level without any volume . 
LUKOIL was $ 13.30 after $ 13.35 .
