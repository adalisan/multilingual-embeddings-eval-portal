euro high sulphur fuel oil barges had a softer start of the week on crude dipping , lack of demand and more cargoes reported entering the market , traders said . 
high sulphur barges traded once at $ 94.50 fob Rotterdam early in the day , down from Friday &apos;s highest deal at $ 95 , and later offers went down to $ 94 while bids were up to 75 cents lower . 
&quot; barges are lower . 
there &apos;s a few more cargoes around , crude came off about 30 cents and there &apos;s lack of demand . 
all bearish factors , &quot; one trader said . 
at least two traders were reported to be bringing in a few cargoes of mostly Russian cracked fuel into the barge market . 
on the cargo market , Russian was said unchanged to a little weaker at two means + $ 1 / $ 1.5 , just a touch lower than straight-run , of which several cargoes are still unsold . 
a utility was still on the market chasing any low priced cargoes , cutting further its bid to about $ 86 / $ 87 from $ 89 CIF a tonne last week -- prices deemed far below the market by several traders . 
one percent continued quiet with little talk heard in the market as a major buyer did not come back as expected to sniff around for September barrels and sellers were said holding off to sell later at higher prices with a strong contango between swaps and prompt cargoes . 
only one major was heard offering a cargo and some traders said low sulphur cargoes were steady at $ 94 / $ 96 fob with September swaps at $ 98 / $ 99 . 
low sulphur fuel barges were very quiet but notionally assessed steady at $ 97 / $ 98 a tonne , or up to $ 3 above high sulphur barges . 
&quot; This market is as dead as a duck . 
even if I offer at the lower number , $ 97 , there &apos;s still not buying , &quot; a trader with a major said .
