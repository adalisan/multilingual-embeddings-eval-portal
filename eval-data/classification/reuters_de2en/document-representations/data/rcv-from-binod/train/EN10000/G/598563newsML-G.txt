the government has firmed up a package to tackle the swelling oil pool deficit . 
the strategy paper would include hiking the prices of diesel , liquid petroleum gas ( LPG ) and kerosene , and a phased dismantling of the administered price mechanism ( APM ) . 
prices of petrol were left untouched . 
the strategy was endorsed by the prime minister . 
it was suggested that prices of high speed diesel and LPG should be hiked by 15 percent each , while kerosene prices should be increased by 20 percent . 
the proposed price hike , if implemented , would reduce the oil pool deficit by about 55 billion rupees . 
the finance minister is upset over the poor recovery of non-performing assets ( NPAs ) by banks and has called a review meeting to tackle the problem of past dues . 
a large chunk of this is owed by corporates and businessmen . 
the minister is also keen to streamline the largely ineffective debt recovery tribunals , which were set up in 1993 to help banks recover past dues . 
finance ministry officials said the meeting would be attended by the presiding officers of the debt recovery tribunals located in each banking zone . 
legislative changes were also likely to be considered . 
the Reserve Bank of India has amended the rules for investments of residuary non-banking finance companies ( RNBCs ) .

RNBCs with a positive net worth could invest 20 percent of their deposits according to their discretion . 
besides , all RNBCs would have to ensure that the debt instruments of companies in which they invested had a minimum credit rating of AA . 
the issue , constituting 22 percent of the company &apos;s 5.4 billion rupee equity , was placed with six to seven funds including the government of Singapore Investment Authority , peregrine Direct Investment and AIG Investment . 
change in investor perception to the ADR was attributed to the restructuring of the BPLCH business keeping in mind investor preferences and incentives announced in the budget . 
the high courts of Allahabad and Gwalior upheld the government notification on direct-to-home broadcasting ( DTH ) services . 
the ruling was expected to set a precedent in similar cases filed in several courts all over the country , including Delhi and Bombay . 
while upholding the December 19 , 1996 notification , the courts dismissed cases challenging it . 
the notification had virtually banned DTH as it made possession of apparatus capable of receiving Ku-band signals in the range of 4,800 MHz and above , illegal .

top blue-chip companies are preparing to take advantage of the external commercial borrowings ( ECB ) guidelines announced in April and raise $ 100 million in dollar debt for 10 years without any end-use restrictions .

legal circles expect the proposed act to restrict itself to delineating foreign exchange transactions on the capital account , leaving the money laundering bill to empower investigating agencies to tackle white collar crime .
