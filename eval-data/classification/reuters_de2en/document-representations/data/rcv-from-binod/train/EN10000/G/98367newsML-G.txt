Roberto Alomar , strongly castigated for spitting on an umpire last week , hit a home run in the 12th inning to lift the Baltimore Orioles to a 4-3 win over the Cleveland Indians and to the League Championship Series . 
the Orioles will play the New York Yankees , who beat the Texas Rangers 6-4 on Saturday , in a series for the American League pennant , beginning on Tuesday in New York . 
the Yankees came back from a 4-0 deficit to beat the Rangers 3-1 and to reach the League Championship Series in 15 years . 
Bernie Williams hit home runs from both sides of the plate for the Yankees and Cecil Fielder tied the game with a single . 
&quot; This is really great to come in here and win two games because after losing last year we came in with a great attitude , &quot; Williams said . 
Alomar , who also had the game-winning Homer when the Orioles clinched the Al wild-card berth last Saturday , blasted closer Jose Mesa &apos;s 1-1 pitch over the right-centre field fence . 
six Cleveland pitchers combined to strike out 23 batters , including nine in a row from the fifth to the eighth innings . 
Alomar has been the focal point of the playoffs since spitting on umpire John Hirschbeck last Friday at Toronto . 
the umpires wanted him suspended for the series , but he will serve a suspension at the beginning of next season . 
&quot; I &apos;ve been going through a lot of tough times , &quot; Alomar said . 
&quot; I &apos;m real happy to come here and help my team win . 
I went up there just to get a hit ( in the 12th ) . 
&quot; Robby is a great player and an emotional player , &quot; said Orioles manager Davey Johnson . 
&quot; He &apos;s been sensitive to what happened in Toronto and it has hurt him a great deal . 
yet when we needed the big hits , he got it . 
to be great you have to concentrate at a higher level . 
for Robby , the tougher it gets , his focus gets keener . 
Mesa ( 0-1 ) , who was beginning his fourth inning of relief , was also victimised by Alomar in the ninth in an attempt to save a 3-2 lead . 
with two men on , Alomar lined a single to left-centre to force extra innings . 
Cleveland &apos;s Omar Vizquel , who had an RBI single , said of the loss : &quot; It felt like someone stepping on your heart . 
Armando Benitez ( 2-0 ) , who allowed Albert belle &apos;s go-ahead grand slam in the seventh inning of Game Three , had four strikeouts over two scoreless innings of relief . 
Randy Myers worked a perfect 12th for his second save as Baltimore became the first team in the series to win on the road . 
new York again received an outstanding effort from its bullpen , which was finally scored upon but shut down Texas over the final six innings , allowing just one hit . 
David weathers pitched three scoreless innings . 
Mariano Rivera worked the seventh and eighth and John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his second save in as many games . 
new York was able to overcome yet another Homer by Juan Gonzalez , who went deep for the fifth time in the series . 
Williams , who homered and drove in the tying run in Game Three win on Friday , tied the game at 4-4 in the fifth with a one-out Homer to right field off Roger Pavlik . 
in the ninth , Williams switched to the right side of the plate and blasted a one-out Homer to left field off Mike Stanton , giving the Yankees an insurance run . 
new York pushed across the go-ahead run in the seventh . 
TIM Raines singled to shallow left off Pavlik and was sacrificed to second by Wade Boggs . 
Tino Martinez hit a grounder that was smothered by first baseman Will Clark , who was unable to make the play at first as Raines advanced to third . 
Fielder grounded a single to left to score Raines . 
the Yankees managed just one hit in the first three innings off Bobby Witt and fell behind 4-0 before scoring three times in the fourth . 
an ineffective performance by starter and former Ranger Kenny Rogers did not prove costly as manager Joe Torre lifted the left-hander after just two innings . 
Juan Gonzalez homered in his fourth straight post-season game , tying the major league record set by Jeffrey Leonard of San Francisco in 1987 . 
Gonzalez &apos; home run was the first run allowed by the Yankee bullpen in the series . 
his five homers in a series tied the major-league mark shared by Ken Griffey Junior of Seattle ( 1995 ) and Reggie Jackson of the Yankees ( 1977 ) .
