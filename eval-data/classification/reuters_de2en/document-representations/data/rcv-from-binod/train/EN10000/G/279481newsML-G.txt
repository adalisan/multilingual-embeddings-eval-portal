the United States said its diplomats seeking an apology from North Korea over a submarine incident held &quot; serious and useful &quot; talks with Pyongyang envoys , and media reports on Sunday said an apology was imminent . 
South Korean and Japanese media said North Korea may apologise as early as Sunday over the incursion of a submarine carrying 26 heavily-armed agents into the South in September . 
U.S. and North Korean diplomats have been meeting in New York to try to patch up a furious row over the incident that has escalated military tensions on the Korean peninsula and threatened a key nuclear accord . 
South Korea has demanded a &quot; clear apology &quot; as the price for resuming aid shipments and other contacts with the North . 
Japan &apos;s Kyodo news agency quoted diplomatic sources as saying North Korea and the United States had agreed on a final text of an apology , which would be broadcast over Radio Pyongyang on Sunday . 
South Korea had agreed to return the remains of North Korean agents killed by South Korean troops during a massive manhunt , Kyodo said in a despatch from Seoul . 
twenty four of the infiltrators were shot and killed , one was captured alive and one is still on the loose . 
State department spokeswoman Phyllis Young said she could not confirm reports that Pyongyang would soon comply with South Korean demands for an apology . 
&quot; The talks were serious and useful , &quot; she said , without giving any details of the substance of the talks on Friday . 
more meetings were probable , she added . 
previous working-level meetings took place on Saturday and on Monday . 
on Saturday South Korea &apos;s foreign ministry said it had details of the North Korean apology and expected the affair would be wrapped up within a day . 
South Korea &apos;s Yonhap Television News reported on Sunday that an apology may be delivered on Sunday &quot; at the earliest &quot; . 
it gave no source for its report . 
Yonhap quoted unnamed South Korean officials as saying Seoul would not return the submarine or the captured North Korean , as Pyongyang has demanded . 
South Korean President Kim Young-sam condenmed the intrusion as a &quot; military provocation &quot; that violated a truce that ended the 1950-53 Korean War . 
he froze all contacts with the North and warned of &quot; all-out war &quot; . 
the South also suspended the implementation of a 1994 agreement between Washington and Pyongyang under which it will supply nuclear reactors to the North . 
under the accord , Pyongyang froze its nuclear arms programme . 
North Korea is on the verge of famine because of devastating floods and economic mismanagement and desperately needs to put the submarine crisis behind it so it can get further food aid from the United States . 
resolving the crisis would also clear the way for progress on four-party talks proposed by the United States and South Korea with the North and China on a lasting peace to replace the Korean armistice . 
it would allow further discussion on opening a U.S. diplomatic liaison office in Pyongyang , which has been bogged down over technical details . 
the North Korean side in the New York talks is led by Li Hyong Chol , director of American affairs in Pyongyang &apos;s Foreign Ministry . 
mark Minton , director of the State Department &apos;s office of Korean affairs , leads the U.S. side .
