Armenia must make corrections to its economic course after recent problems with reform , the head of the International Monetary Fund delegation to the country , Thanos Satsambas , said on Monday . 
&quot; We have found certain digressions from the programme we had approved and we are trying to find ways to put it back on track in January or February , &quot; he told a news conference . 
&quot; This time it is not a crisis , &quot; he added , referring to the reform process . 
&quot; But things have to be returned to their normal shape . 
he said government plans to allow inflation to climb to an annual 14 percent in 1997 after this year &apos;s approximately 10 percent were not acceptable to the IMF . 
&quot; We cannot agree to this level of inflation for 1997 . 
if it is possible to have a 10-percent inflation this year , it is not advisable to set it higher for 1997 , &quot; Satsambas said . 
inflation quickened to 2.4 percent in November from an average of two percent in September and October , and Satsambas said December inflation appeared to be quickening even faster . 
he said the system of commercial banks had to be re-shaped , allowing mergers and closures of weaker banks . 
Satsambas said Armenia had not met a number of economic targets . 
government expenditures had not decreased as planned in 1996 , while income was not meeting agreed-upon targets and central bank credits to the government had exceeded planned levels , he said . 
that put pressure on the national currency and reduced the central bank &apos;s reserves , he added . 
the mission last time visited Armenia in August and it was happy with the course of economic reform in the country . 
Armenia is among the few former Soviet republics where the economy showed signs of steady growth over the past several years . 
industrial output rose by 1.5 percent over the first nine months of the year , and Gross Domestic Product rose 4.5 percent .
