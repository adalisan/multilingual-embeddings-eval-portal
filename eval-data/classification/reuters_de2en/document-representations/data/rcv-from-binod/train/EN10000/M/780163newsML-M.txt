Germany &apos;s DAX index rose around 1.33 percent in a quiet bourse session on Tuesday , as a stable close on Wall Street overnight took some of the pressure off the German equity market . 
the rise of the dollar , looking increasingly rampant after the Bundesbank refrained from springing a surprise change in interest rate policy , also comforted the increasingly jittery market . 
&quot; We are not going through the roof today , but we are also not going to go through the floor . 
movements of 100 points in either direction in the current environment are really nothing special , &quot; a Frankfurt trader said . 
the DAX index of 30 German blue-chips was up 56.27 points at 4,353.21 , recouping some of Monday &apos;s losses , while the September DAX future was also stronger , up 45.5 points at 4,371 . 
&quot; It is very quiet and we could go either way today , but I think that in the next few days we will see the consolidation take hold properly , which is very healthy for the market at the moment , &quot; she said . 
the main news of the morning was the decision by the powerful Bundesbank to leave monetary policy on hold for the time being . 
the central bank called for bids for securities repurchase funds at an unchanged interest rate of three percent . 
there had been speculation that it could engineer higher money-market rates by calling for a variable-rate tender alongside the expected fixed-rate tender . 
this speculation had driven the dollar nearly 1.5 pfennigs down from its peaks against the mark overnight , but the Bundesbank &apos;s &quot; no-change &quot; announcement soon set the dollar back on its upwards march . 
early in bourse trade the dollar had again penetrated the 1.87-mark level . 
export stocks profited from the dollar advance , as has been the theme for many weeks now . 
chemical group Hoechst AG was up 2.5 percent at 85.65 marks , while drugs group Schering AG was up around two percent at 204.60 marks .
