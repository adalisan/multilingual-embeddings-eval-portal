the Indonesian rupiah rose above the central bank ceiling against the dollar in slow late trading on Tuesday after the bank raised its fixing rate , dealers said . 
they said the central bank appeared to have absorbed some dollars from the market after it raised its intervention rate by one point to 2,321 / 2,513 and the conversion rate also by one point to 2,321 / 2,369 on Tuesday . 
they said local operators who had collected dollars in the morning below the 2,321.0 level could now unload to the central bank until the last squaring time at 0900 GMT . 
&quot; It wasn &apos;t a surprise . 
it has been widely anticipated . 
we are now just trying to cash out some of the gains , &quot; one said . 
dealers said the amount of dollars absorbed by the central bank appeared to be relatively small because trading was slow . 
however , one local bank dealer speculated that the amount could add up to some $ 70 to $ 100 million . 
&quot; You can see swap premiums had declined generally after the fixing because people are anticipating additional rupiah supply on Thursday , &quot; the dealer said . 
&quot; sentiment on the rupiah remains strong , &quot; he said . 
spot rupiah was quoted at 2,320.80 / 21.10 at 0910 GMT , compared with an opening of 2,320.5 / 21.5 . 
tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,320.1 / 20.4 and 2,319.3 / 19.8 , respectively . 
economists said earlier the central bank would have no problem in supporting the dollar if it did touch its floor rate because it could neutralise additional monetary supply through short-term securities ( SBIs ) . 
they said outstanding SBIs were much lower now compared to last year &apos;s level and M2 money supply aggregates had fallen . 
one Japanese bank dealer said liquidity in the money market might begin to ease on Wednesday as indicated by declines in overnight money to 12.0 / 13.0 percent from 15.0 / 16.0 percent . 
he said Bank Indonesia had also offered overnight central bank certificates ( SBIs ) at 10.0 percent this afternoon . 
&quot; It might be the begin of a turnaround . 
swap rates were seen declining across the board , &quot; the local bank dealer said . 
overnight swap was at 0.75 / 0.80 and Tom / next at 0.70 / 0.78 . 
one-month swap fell to 18.50 / 19.25 from 19.5 / 20.0 , two to 35.0 / 36.0 from 35.75 / 36.75 , three to 52.5 / 54.0 from 53.5 / 55.0 and six to 102.25 / 103.00 from 103.75 / 105.00 points .
