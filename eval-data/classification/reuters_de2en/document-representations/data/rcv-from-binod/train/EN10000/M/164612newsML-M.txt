Jordanian shares fell for a seventh consecutive trading day on Monday in the quietest business since January as investors shunned Amman &apos;s becalmed bourse . 
the Amman Financial Market 60-share index fell 0.13 percent to 147.74 points after shares worth a paltry 202,000 dinars ( $ 285,000 ) changed hands . 
&quot; There &apos;s no outside interest . 
all the business today was between floor traders , &quot; said one broker . 
only six companies registered a turnover of more than 10,000 dinars . 
Arab Bank Group , which accounts for one third of capitalisation on the exchange , led the way with 24,000 dinars worth of trade . 
it fell 0.50 dinars to 246.50 dinars . 
falling shares outnumbered risers by 19 to seven . 
twelve shares traded but closed unchanged . 
&quot; In spite of the attractive prices of many stocks to buy , local institutional investors are still cautious of getting heavily involved in the market , &quot; financial group Pearl Consulting said in a market report . 
brokers said there was little chance this week of a reverse in the declining trend . 
only General Investment bucked the trend , rising five percent for the third day in a row to close at 3.34 dinars . 
but brokers said the rarely traded stock was being pushed higher by low-volume transactions between major shareholders . 
the official AFM index has been little changed since early October , trading between 146.5 and 149 points . 
fears over stalled Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and neighbouring Iraq &apos;s continued absence from international oil markets have combined with domestic pessimism to cramp bourse activity .
