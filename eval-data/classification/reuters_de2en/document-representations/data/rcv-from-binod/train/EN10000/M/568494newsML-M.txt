CSCE coffee futures ended mostly higher in moderate dealings on Thursday , bolstered by speculative buying amid news of a strike by portworkers at Brazil &apos;s key port of Santos , trading sources said . 
benchmark July jumped 5.50 cents per lb on the day , to 216.90 cents , after ranging between 219.20 and 209.50 . 
the back months closed 0.50 to 3.15 higher . 
spot May was the only contract to suffer losses on Thursday , as operators liquidated positions or rolled them forward ahead of the spot month &apos;s expiry on May 19 . 
may dropped 5.65 cents , to 240.00 cents , shrinking the May / July switch to 23.10 cents from 34.25 cents at the close on Wednesday . 
the July / September switch , however , widened to 22.40 cents from 20.05 cents . 
dealers said news of the Santos portworkers strike , which only affected public terminals , sparked enough buying to trigger technical buy-stops above 213.50 cents basis July . 
Santos is Brazil &apos;s key coffee loading port , accounting for just under one million bags of the 1.2 million bags covered so far by bills of lading for April shipment . 
&quot; It &apos;s positive , &quot; said Smith Barney analyst Walt Spilka . 
&quot; Santos exports coffee , and anything that interferes with exports is going to be supportive . 
the work stoppage , protesting delayed payment of portworkers &apos; full April salary , will continue until the workers recieve written confirmation the port authority has paid the remaining salary , a union official said Thursday . 
the remaining payment , about 35 percent of the total April salary , is expected to be deposited today or Friday . 
additionally , Spilka said the coffee market continued to garner support from dwindling stockpiles of exchange certified coffee . 
the CSCE reported late Wednesday that U.S. certified coffee stocks fell by 3,000 60-kg bags , to 24,699 bags as of May 6 . 
the stock decline came on the heels of a 13,999-bag drop the previous day . 
after Thursday &apos;s close , however , the CSCE reported certified coffee stocks increased by 750 bags , to 25,419 bags as of May 7 . 
there were 17,743 bags of coffee pending grading , the exchange said . 
if more coffee shows up at the exchange for certification and the Brazilian strike is resolved quickly , some traders said July may try to test key technical support at 209.00 cents . 
after 209.00 cents , July &apos;s next downside target would be near 203.00 cents . 
but despite the modest stock build , other traders noted inventories remain extremely low . 
they said continued supply worries , combined with the start of the Brazilian winter , should underpin prices . 
volume reached an estimated 7,623 lots on the day .
