foreign Minister David Levy said on Sunday that Israel was prepared to move quickly on peace with the Palestinians but action must be reciprocal . 
he was speaking after talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher , who has urged Israel to take &quot; concrete steps &quot; to keep up the momentum of this week &apos;s meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat . 
&quot; The question of reciprocity is fundamental , &quot; Levy told a news conference . 
&quot; We will go as quickly as it takes to ensure success and to ensure reciprocal agreements , &quot; added Levy , who reiterated Israel &apos;s insistence that Arafat &quot; do everything in his power to combat terrorism &quot; . 
Christopher and Levy met at the U.S. ambassador &apos;s residence in London ahead of talks in Washington on Monday between Netanyahu and President Bill Clinton . 
Christopher , who returns to Washington later on Sunday , will hold talks with Netanyahu on Monday morning and then attend the prime minister &apos;s meeting with Clinton at the White House later . 
U.S. officials said Levy , who has a prickly relationship with Netanyahu , was not coming to Washington . 
the Secretary , addressing the joint news conference with Levy , said that in addition to trying to keep the Israeli-Palestinian peace process moving forward , the United States was continuing to work to restart Israel-Syria negotiations that broke down in May . 
&quot; Both Israel and Syria have indicated a desire to resume discussions , &quot; he said . 
Washington was working to find an &quot; appropriate &quot; basis , Christopher said . 
but State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns later said : &quot; I cannot point to any recent progress in that area . 
in an interview on Saturday with reporters accompanying him on a five-day trip to Europe , Christopher pressed Israel for new &quot; concrete steps &quot; to advance Mideast peace after the Netanyahu- Arafat meeting on Wednesday on the Gaza-Israel border . 
the Americans see the meeting as a psychological breakthrough that should provide momentum for further action . 
in particular , Christopher said he would press for &quot; substantial easing &quot; of Israel &apos;s closure of borders with the West Bank and Gaza , a move that has imposed severe hardship on Palestinians by curtailing trade and access to jobs . 
burns indicated , however , that Christopher softened this message , telling Levy that Israel should be congratulated for opening the border to 50,000 Palestinian workers , up from 32,000 , and the process should continue . 
pressed on Sunday on what more Israel could do , Christopher said redeploying troops in Hebron , as promised in peace accords with the Palestinians , was &quot; an important step to be taken . 
he also reiterated the U.S. view that Arafat &apos;s commitment to fight terrorism was essential . 
Christopher stressed that a steering committee established by Netanyahu and Arafat would address further steps . 
he also announced that joint U.S.-Israel working group on terrorism would hold its first meeting in Washington on November 25 and 26 . 
it was one result of the U.S.-initiated summit on terrorism at Sharm el-Sheikh , Egypt , held last March to forge an international front after a series of attacks against Israel . 
the right-wing Likud Party of Netanyahu and Levy had opposed Israel &apos;s peacemaking with Palestinians during campaigning for elections last May but Levy said that despite this , the government has made a &quot; determined decision &quot; to pursue peace . 
the two ministers also said they discussed Iraq and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty which Israel has agreed to sign .
