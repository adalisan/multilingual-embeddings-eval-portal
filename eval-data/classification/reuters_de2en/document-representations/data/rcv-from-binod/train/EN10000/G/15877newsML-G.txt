the two parties in the ruling leftist coalition are unlikely to agree on a planned cabinet reshuffle at their meeting on Wednesday , a senior official of the larger Democratic Left Alliance ( SLD ) said . 
&quot; More meetings will be needed to reach a compromise , &quot; Leszek Miller , the cabinet Chief-of-Staff and a leader of the ex-communist SLD party , said on Tuesday . 
he said that the SLD and the smaller Polish Peasant Party ( PSL ) would discuss at the meeting whether the reshuffle , linked with a coming reform of ministries , should involve dismissing the current government and appointing a new one . 
&quot; Negotiations on appointments in ministries will probably come later , &quot; Miller told Reuters . 
the PSL wants the entire current cabinet dismissed and a new one sworn in during implementation of the reform and analysts say the party hopes in this way to increase its role in the government . 
the SLD says the minister should be replaced gradually by its Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz .
