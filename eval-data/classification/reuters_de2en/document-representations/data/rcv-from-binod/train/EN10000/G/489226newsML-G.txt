gunmen barred Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino from visiting a town north of Tirana on Saturday in a fresh challenge to authority as Albania prepares for the arrival of a multinational Italian-led force . 
a government spokesman said armed men barred Fino &apos;s route at Bushat 100 km ( 60 miles ) north of Tirana and turned back his convoy of cars . 
Fino was meeting cabinet ministers to discuss the incident . 
&quot; The first conclusion is that this ugly event has been orchestrated by anti-government forces , which oppose its national reconciliation stand , &quot; the spokesman said . 
Fino , a 34-year-old Socialist from southern Albania , had been driving north with several other cabinet ministers towards the town of Shkoder when they were turned back . 
the Albanian news agency ATA said the government representative in Shkoder , on hearing of the incident , reaffirmed the region &apos;s support for the unity government appointed on March 11 . 
much of southern Albania is in rebel hands after protests at the collapse of popular savings systems spilled over into insurrection last month . 
until now , the north has in theory been under government control . 
Italy is planning to lead a multinational force of 6,000 troops to protect aid deliveries to Albanians , but has said it will not be ready to launch the operation until April 14 .
