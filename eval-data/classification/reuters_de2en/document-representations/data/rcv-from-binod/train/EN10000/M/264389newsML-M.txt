NYCE frozen concentrated orange juice futures closed weaker , with the most-active March contract hitting a fresh life-of-contract low for the second consecutive day . 
the May contract also fell to a new low of 95.90 cents . 
analysts said the fundamental and technical outlooks point to lower prices , but no firm support exists in the market . 
a cold front that is not likely to damage the Florida crop sparked a selloff earlier in the week , while slack demand adds constant pressure to prices with adequate supplies forecast . 
Celeste Georgakis , vice president with Dean Witter , said that until prices are lowered at the consumer level , the market will have difficulty turning around . 
fruit prices are also high , she said . 
on the technical front , the market remains in a downtrend with prices not yet oversold . 
dealers said prices could bounce slighty ahead of the holiday &apos;s as players square books , but they don &apos;t expect a significant move higher unless a freeze moves into Florida . 
March closed down 1.50 cents at 92.35 cents a pound , traded 94.50 to 92.25 , a contract low . 
spot January went out 1.55 lower at 88.85 cents . 
volume was estimated at 3,500 lots .
