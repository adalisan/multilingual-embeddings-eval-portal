Turkish shares lost an average 1.47 percent Monday in a correction which had been expected following an 18.1 percent surge over the past seven days of consecutive record highs , brokers said . 
the IMKB National-100 closed at 1,136 , down 17 points from Friday &apos;s all-time high of 1,153 , but firmer from an afternoon low of 1,128 . 
in dollar terms , it eased to $ 1.02 from Friday &apos;s record high of $ 1.04 . 
trade volume plunged to 14.48 trillion lira from Friday &apos;s 25.47 trillion . 
&quot; A correction was awaited for today after last week &apos;s sharp rise . 
weekend developments , including renewed tension in Cyprus also boosted sales , &quot; said Hasan Soydan from Garanti investment bank . 
the latest row broke out late last week over Greek Cypriot plans to deploy anti-aircraft missiles on the divided island , followed by Turkish threats to retaliate with a military strike . 
brokers said a new challenge to privatisation also soured sentiment . 
KIGEM , a non-governmental body for the development of management in public firms , said on Saturday it would apply to an administrative court for the cancellation of the tender for the partial selloff of flat steel maker and bluechip Eregli . 
the tender for the block sale of a 30-40 percent state-held stake in Eregli is due to close on January 27 . 
the market has already been waiting for a decision by the constitutional court since it began debating in late November a challenge to the selloff law on Turk Telekom . 
the court has scheduled a meeting for January 21 to discuss the case . 
of the 239 shares traded , 127 declined , 72 advanced and 40 ended steady . 
Actives were led by Eregli , down 500 lira at 14,250 , Dogan Holding , up 250 lira at 2,950 and utility Aktas Elektrik , steady at 115,000 . 
together , they made up 13.9 percent of the total volume .
