heavy global supplies may continue to dominate a gloomy picture in LIFFE soft commodity futures this week while buyers await even lower prices , traders said . 
prices of coffee , cocoa and sugar retreated last week and , with the fundamental scenarios still bleak , they could probe new technical lows to inspire demand , analysts said . 
Robusta was likely to stay in a range , underpinned by roasters at the lows and pressured by origins . 
&quot; We &apos;re going to see the same trend . 
Scale-up origin selling above $ 1,400 and scale-down roaster buying at $ 1,365 , &quot; said one trader . 
benchmark January ended at a flat $ 1,394 a tonne Friday . 
London coffee has kept its distance from stubborn physical tightness in the U.S. where exchange-certified stocks plunged to historic lows , buoying the nearby December switch . 
traders said European roasters were relatively comfortable . 
funds , currently short , could run back for cover if prices made an upside break , but a rally was set to encounter a spate of producer selling from active Far Eastern and African origins . 
the November / January spread , which rose to $ 140 last week before dropping to $ 80 , could stay under pressure , traders said . 
cocoa traders were disillusioned by the failure to sustain technically-neutral levels after a corrective move faltered at 968 stg on March last week , reversing to seven-month lows . 
&quot; The market will remain under pressure , &quot; said one trader . 
March could see new lows after a test of the sensitive 945 stg following Friday &apos;s finish near the day &apos;s lows at 949 stg . 
the main hindrance was stubbornly low-key industry buying , unlikely to speed up unless prices showed signs of bottoming . 
players would closely monitor robust sterling which fuelled origin selling last week as it broke new highs . 
news on Ivorian arrivals would also feature high on the market &apos;s agenda . 
the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit saw further price retrenchment in cocoa , saying stocks were higher than expected despite strong consumption growth in 1996 . 
analysts also stayed bearish on London white sugar futures , which took a pounding last week to end at $ 308.20 for December . 
&quot; We &apos;re in a bear run and it doesn &apos;t look as if we &apos;re going to break out of it for the time being , &quot; one futures trader said . 
market sources said the heavy global supply scenario would probably continue to pressure prices , unless the lower levels sparked interest to buy quality cargoes at cheaper prices . 
&quot; Without any significant offtake on the horizon the market could continue to slip , &quot; said brokers Merrill Lynch in a report . 
this week sees the deadline for bids in Syria &apos;s tender to buy 13,000 tonnes of whites and 13,000 tonnes of raws for November / December shipment . 
results are expected on November 6 . 
chart analysts maintained their bearish tone but said some correction could be expected from heavily oversold levels . 
&quot; The RSI ( relative Strength Indicator ) is so oversold that some form of correction to the upside or at the very least a consolidation is due , &quot; said Darren Gurner , an analyst at Sucden .
