villagers in the central Indian hamlets of tamer and Bita on Friday recalled the horror of their world collapsing around them as they waited in summer heat for relief aid . 
authorities said 38 people were killed and thousands made homeless in an earthquake that struck Madhya Pradesh state in the heart of the subcontinent on Thursday , measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale . 
&quot; The authorities are yet to give us the relief material including food , &quot; Bita village chief Gangaram Patel said . 
&quot; It was like a thunderstorm , and smoke billowed out of the soil , &quot; said Patel , who injured his head when a wooden pole supporting a roof fell on him . 
&quot; I rushed out of my house and saw cracks in the walls of the adjoining houses and could hear the roofs coming down in many others . 
bamboo poles used to support roofs jutted out from mounds of earth from broken walls that blocked the narrow alleys of Bita . 
in some places , tin roofs dangled loosely over wrecked houses . 
rescue teams set up camps for the homeless in Jabalpur , a city of 1.2 million people about 20 km ( 12 miles ) from the epicentre . 
Bita lies 10 km ( six miles ) east of the epicentre of the tremor . 
in tamer , adjoining Bita , farm labourer Lokram said the earthquake was like a bulldozer rampaging across the village . 
he folded his hands and looked at the sky , saying : &quot; We are lucky we were saved . 
but no relief has reached us yet and the debris has not been cleared by the authorities . 
&quot; Please ask the authorities to visit our village and provide us with some food and clothing , &quot; Lokram said . 
Gangaram said some 5,000 people were left homeless in the two villages . 
Lokram &apos;s 55-year-old brother , Tekram , said : &quot; We still fear to enter the house , the structure hangs delicately . 
it might collapse any time . 
Ajay Singh , a senior official in Jabalpur , said the tremor caused extensive damage to property but killed relatively few people despite its magnitude . 
the quake , which struck at dawn , levelled several villages near Jabalpur . 
but relatively few villagers died as they were either sleeping outside in the summer heat or were doing early morning chores outside their huts , officials and residents said . 
in Jabalpur &apos;s Victoria Hospital , survivors lay on blood-splattered beds . 
&quot; The earth shook like a see-saw and the roof fell on me , &quot; Ram Kali Bai , 60 , from Puranabasti village near Jabalpur , said from her hospital bed . 
geological Survey of India officials said experts from New Delhi would asses the chances of aftershocks in the region , part of the Narmada River basin that has been hit by five quakes of at least 6.0 on the Richter scale since 1927 . 
in September 1993 , about 10,000 people were killed in neighbouring Maharashtra state when an earthquake measuring 6.3 on the Richter scale struck the Latur-Osmanabad region .
