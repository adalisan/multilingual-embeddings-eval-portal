environmental groups on Monday said energy-producing countries were engineering a stalemate among poor nations in the runup to June &apos;s Earth Summit unless proper financing was forthcoming . 
but Mostafa Tolba , the Egyptian chairman of a preparatory conference , said he regarded the actions of Iran , Saudi Arabia and Nigeria as a negotiating ploy that was not shared by all Third World countries . 
&quot; We are quite used to that over the years , the tactical stands and the trial balloons , &quot; he told reporters . 
&quot; We are not panicking . 
the three countries are attempting to delete all reference in conference documents to reducing the consumption of fossil fuels , like oil , coal and natural gas , until financing for environmental projects are forthcoming . 
the issue is at the core of world environmental policies . 
government environmental experts this week end a three-week session to prepare pledges for the June 23-27 conference among world leaders that will assess programs five years after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro . 
Barbara bramble of the Worldlife Federation said she feared the current discussions would result in weaker language than had been negotiated at Rio , particularly on goals of phasing out government subsidies for fossil fuels . 
&quot; This is a well-calculated but risky strategy to challenge the North &apos;s failures on finance , &quot; said Felix Dodds , director of the United Kingdom committee on environment and development , a non-governmental group . 
fossil fuels are the main sources of polluting &quot; greenhouse gasses , &quot; blamed by key scientists for rising world temperatures that are affecting farms , forest , fisheries and a series of natural disasters . 
European Union nations hope that specific targets for reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide can be set among industrial countries before a meeting on the subject in Kyoto , Japan , in December . 
oil and mining corporations as well as energy-producing countries have been lobbying all over the world to prevent any decision on emission cuts , arguing that too many jobs are at stake . 
Dodds said that government aid to help poorer countries develop in an environmentally safe way had hardly materialized despite promises made at Rio . 
the issue plagued the Rio conference and threatens to do the same at its June follow up . 
&quot; Unless we find a deal of finance , our heads of state will be arriving and they will find that the whole situation is deadlocked , &quot; he said . 
bramble has proposed establishing inter-governmental forums on finance that matches the needs of different groups of countries so that all countries would not be required to attend numerous meeting all year around on the same subject . 
the aim is to exchange experiences and come up with concrete proposals that could target the limited international aid and finances in a more organized fashion . 
the proposal has received some encouragement from the United States , Russia and numerous eastern European nations but the European Union , which has a separate forum on such financing , still opposes it .
