a witness told a U.N. tribunal on Wednesday that a former Rwandan Hutu mayor , on trial for genocide and crimes against humanity , ordered the killing of three brothers from his commune . 
the witness said Jean Paul Akayesu had ordered the shooting of the brothers who had been hiding at the back of his house . 
the three were forced to lie flat on their stomachs and shot in the back of the head , he said . 
&quot; He said he knew them because they were from his commune and he told the people they would be shot , &quot; the witness , described only as &quot; Q &quot; told the court . 
the trial of Akayesu was adjourned last week after he complained of a headache . 
Akayesu has pleaded not guilty to charges of genocide and crimes against humanity involving massacres at Taba commune in central Rwanda where he was mayor in 1994 during the three- month mass slaughter . 
he is the first suspect to be tried before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and if convicted will face life imprisonment , the court &apos;s highest penalty . 
an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered in Rwanda mostly by Hutu troops , militiamen and mobs after the killing of Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana .
