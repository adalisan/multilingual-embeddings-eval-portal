crown Prince Hassan of Jordan has postponed a visit to Israel next month because he is too busy , a palace official said on Tuesday . 
he denied an Israeli press report that the trip had been put off because Jordan feared being seen as the only Arab country in close contact with the Jewish state . 
&quot; It &apos;s absolute nonsense . 
it &apos;s just overburdened schedules , &quot; the spokesman said . 
he said the visit was expected to go ahead later this year , but no new schedule had been fixed . 
the trip would be just the second public visit by Prince Hassan to Israel , after he attended last year &apos;s funeral in Jerusalem of slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , the spokesman said . 
Israel &apos;s Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper said on Tuesday Prince Hassan had postponed the visit , scheduled for October 6 , because Jordan did not want to be seen to be too close to Israel at a time when Middle East peace talks had hit a stalemate . 
Rabin signed a peace treaty in 1994 with Jordan , which of all of Israel &apos;s Arab peace partners has maintained the closest relations with the right-wing government of Benjamin Netanyahu since his election in May .
