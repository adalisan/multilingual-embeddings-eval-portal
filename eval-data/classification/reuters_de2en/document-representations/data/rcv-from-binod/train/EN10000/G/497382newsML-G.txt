Indian Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda , facing a crisis after the Congress party withdrew critical support to his coalition , was quoted on Wednesday as saying his alliance would not agree to a change in leadership . 
but he expressed hope that &quot; some positive &quot; solution would emerge from discussions between his United Front alliance and the Congress after the two parties agreed to hold talks . 
&quot; The United Front has already decided that there will be no change in leadership . 
this issue is not negotiable , &quot; DEVE Gowda was quoted by the Press Trust of India ( PTI ) as telling reporters . 
the ruling United Front invited Congress for formal talks on Wednesday ahead of a vote of confidence that the minority government is scheduled to face in parliament on Friday . 
the Congress party has said it is willing to support the United Front government if DEVE Gowda is replaced as the parliamentary leader of the centre-left alliance . 
the Congress offered support to the coalition last year to defeat a 12-day-old government formed by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) . 
the Congress accused DEVE Gowda of not containing &quot; communal forces , &quot; a reference to the BJP , the Congress party &apos;s arch-rival . 
PTI said Gowda described as &quot; a positive step &quot; a decision by the two groups to start talks to resolve differences .
