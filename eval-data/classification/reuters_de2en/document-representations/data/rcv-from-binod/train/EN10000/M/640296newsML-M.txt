NYMEX Henry hub natgas futures inched up slightly late Thursday in moderate activity , with prices holding recent technical ranges amid little reason to move far in either direction , market sources said . 
by 1405 EDT , July inched up 0.3 cent to $ 2.16 per million British thermal units after dipping to $ 2.105 early . 
August was 0.7 cent higher at $ 2.175 . 
most others were up too . 
&quot; There may be a slight bearish bias , but I don &apos;t see much movement near-term . 
there &apos;s good buying ( in July ) ahead of $ 2.08 and I don &apos;t see us getting through it , &quot; said a Midwest trader , adding the market seemed range-bound for now . 
with almost no extreme heat expected in the U.S. for the next week or more , most agreed there was little potential for a significant rally in the near term . 
but favorable summer-to-winter spreads this week should keep the pace of injections brisk and lend some support . 
traders said rumors of a problem at Henry hub , the NYMEX delivery point , helped stir early buying , but a spokesman from Sabine , the hub operator , said he was unaware of any problem . 
most agreed Wednesday &apos;s Aga data showing a 93 bcf weekly stock build was slightly bearish . 
for the same week last year , inventories gained 88 bcf . 
technical traders pegged minor support at $ 2.10 , with better buying likely at $ 2.08 . 
further support was seen at $ 2.05 and $ 2.00 . 
resistance was pegged at $ 2.17 , $ 2.21 , $ 2.25 , $ 2.37-2.38 and the contract high of $ 2.44 . 
in the cash , Gulf Coast prices slipped a penny or two to the low-teens . 
Midcon pipes were down a similar amount to the low- $ 2s .
