the Kenyan shilling maintained steady gains against the dollar on Thursday in an unmatched market , commercial bank dealers said . 
the Central Bank of Kenya posted a shilling mean rate of 54.55 against the dollar compared to 54.57 on Wednesday . 
against the pound , the shilling was posted at a mean rate of 88.58 from 88.82 on Wednesday . 
dealers said there were a lot of inflows coming in from coffee export sales and foreign investors looking to buy treasury bills . 
some dealers said despite some modest demand from a few corporate buyers , it was not enough to stem the shilling &apos;s appreciation against the dollar . 
&quot; With such little buying interest , the shilling will remain bullish , &quot; one dealer said . 
the money market was liquid with overnight rates quoted between 6-12 percent compared to 5-10 percent on Wednesday .
