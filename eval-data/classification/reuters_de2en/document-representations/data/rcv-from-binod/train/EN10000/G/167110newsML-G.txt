the dismissal of Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto &apos;s government could have important ramifications for Afghanistan &apos;s Taleban militia , now locked in war with a northern alliance , Afghan watchers said on Tuesday . 
they said despite Islamabad &apos;s regular denials of any support to any factions in Afghanistan &apos;s civil war , few people in Kabul doubted that Pakistani support for the Taleban was wide-ranging . 
&quot; politically and militarily , Bhutto &apos;s government has stood firmly beside the Taleban . 
the evidence is overwhelming , &quot; said one veteran Afghan watcher who asked not to be identified . 
&quot; What we are all going to be looking at now is whether the divisions within the Pakistani establishment over Afghan policy will come into the open now that Benazir has gone , &quot; he said . 
Pakistan has consistently denied that it provides military or other support to the Taleban , saying it has no favourites among Afghan factions , most of whom it helped during the struggle against Soviet occupation in the 1980s . 
President Farooq Leghari dismissed Bhutto in the early hours of Tuesday , dissolved the national assembly and called fresh elections , accusing her government of corruption and nepotism . 
dismissed with her was Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar , widely credited with playing a key role in the formation of the purist Islamic Taleban movement that emerged from religious schools in Pakistani refugee camps two years ago . 
since then they have swept to control of three-quarters of Afghanistan and their only real barrier to national power is a northern alliance of Uzbek leader Abdul Rashid Dostum and ousted government military chief Ahmad Shah Masood . 
they are fighting on two fronts , one just north of Kabul and the second in the far northwestern province of Badghis . 
Babar has tried to bring the two sides to peace talks , but his efforts appear to have made little progress . 
&quot; The problem with Babar as intermediary is that first he told Dostum he was speaking on behalf of the Taleban and second that Dostum knows very well that without Babar there would have been no Taleban , &quot; one Afghan watcher said . 
they said that Babar , along with the Pakistani intelligence outfit inter-services Intelligence ( ISI ) , helped organise the Taleban into a military body with money , arms and advice . 
such accusations have been made officially by several of Afghanistan &apos;s neighbours who also have their favourite factions in a country linking the Middle East , Central Asia and the Indian sub-continent and that has been at war for 17 years . 
witnesses say that in the past month since the Taleban drove Masood from Kabul , they have seen two convoys of Pakistani military trucks arrive in the Afghan capital . 
one was carrying Pakistani volunteers destined for the front lines and the other was carrying ammunition . 
large transport planes believed to be Pakistani arrive regularly at Kabul airport carrying war supplies , the witnesses said . 
Western reporters regularly meet Pakistani volunteers , mostly ethnic Pashtuns like the Taleban , on the front line . 
&quot; I &apos;m not sure that anyone has actually proved that Pakistani military officers are near the front lines helping to run the battles , &quot; said an Afghan watcher with a military background . 
&quot; But they are well organised and all the evidence suggests that they are getting intelligence and tactical support from the Pakistanis as well as logistics , &quot; he said . 
but the Afghan watchers said they were hearing of splits within the ISI on whether such extensive covert help to the Taleban was the right policy . 
&quot; We hear some people in ISI are saying the Taleban are not the solution and it will be interesting to see whether the political crisis in Pakistan strengthens that view , &quot; another Afghan watcher said . 
&quot; If it does and there is a move towards a genuine attempt to bring peace to Afghanistan , which would have to involve its other neighbours concerned , then that could be bad news for the Taleban .
