Chechens flocked to vote on Monday for a new president they hope will secure their independence from Moscow after two years of war which destroyed their economy and claimed tens of thousands of lives . 
polling stations closed two hours later than initially planned , at 10 p.m. ( 1900 GMT ) , to accommodate a strong turnout among the estimated 517,000 voters . 
at some polling stations people were still queuing in freezing temperatures to cast their ballot just before closing time -- a strong sign of the hopes the election has raised among a war-weary population hungry for order and stability . 
&quot; We need an end to chaos and these elections will put us on the road to a better life , &quot; said Musa Sagalayev , 45 , after casting his ballot at polling station number seven in the Chechen capital Grozny . 
Aslan Maskhadov , 45 , who led a few thousand guerrilla fighters to a stunning victory over the demoralised Russian army last August , is widely regarded as the frontrunner . 
Reuter reporters who questioned voters in various districts across the mountainous Moslem region said Maskhadov appeared to be well ahead in the race . 
he needs to clear the 50 percent barrier to avoid a run-off ballot in two weeks &apos; time . 
all the main contenders in the 13-man field vow to turn the de facto independence won in the war into sovereignty . 
they include acting president Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev and guerrilla leader Shamil Basayev , who is wanted in Russia for &quot; terrorism &quot; . 
President Boris Yeltsin , who admits sending troops to crush Chechen secession in 1994 was a mistake , agreed to elections as part of a face-saving peace . 
but the Kremlin opposes outright independence for fear of unsettling its southern frontier and fuelling other ethnic conflicts . 
patient queues built up at polling stations throughout a bright winter day , from snow-clad villages in the Caucasus mountains to Soviet-era collective farms on the plain , in Grozny and at special centres where many busloads of war refugees poured in from across the frontier . 
at Basayev &apos;s mountain stronghold of Vedeno , a centre of resistance throughout the war , one hobbling village elder in a shaggy sheepskin hat entered the polling station with the Moslem warcry &quot; Allahu Akbar ! 
&quot; ( God is greatest ) . 
over 100 foreign observers are in Chechnya to monitor an election for the first time . 
several observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) said they were impressed by the smoothness of the process . 
&quot; It is obvious that they want to show Russia and the whole world that they are capable of organising democratic elections , &quot; said one Scandinavian monitor . 
TIM Guldimann , who heads the OSCE mission , said the high turnout was &quot; a very positive sign &quot; . 
none of the observers had any trouble . 
Chechen officials had feared for their safety . 
journalists saw some minor infringements but there was little sign of intimidation of voters and remarkably few guns were in evidence for a region still awash with weaponry . 
in some places , camouflaged guerrilla fighters stacked Kalashnikovs in the corner while they went into the voting booth . 
but the good-humoured crowds were dominated by civilians -- women in headscarves , men in fur and sheepskin hats . 
casting his ballot at a old dairy collective farm 20 km ( 12 miles ) northwest of Grozny , Maskhadov predicted he would win 60 percent of the vote . 
he pledged to &quot; bring order &quot; to Chechnya as his first step and to develop normal ties with Russia . 
&quot; We need to develop normal ties so that we won &apos;t have to wage war any more , &quot; said the grey-haired former Soviet artillery colonel , dressed in a traditional lambswool hat . 
many voters said Maskhadov had the best chance of securing peace . 
Basayev , 32 , who made his name with a bloody raid on a Russian town in 1995 , forecast his own victory and said Russia would &quot; collapse &quot; if it did not accept Chechen independence . 
voting in Vedeno , he also said that , win or lose , he hoped for good relations with other separatist leaders . 
but he later accused Maskhadov of surrounding himself with &quot; criminals &quot; . 
Maskhadov has said he can prevent the Chechen fighters descending into Afghan-style anarchy . 
the first results may come overnight . 
some 850 candidates are also standing for 63 local assembly seats .
