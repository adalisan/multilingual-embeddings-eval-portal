with the pace of diplomacy quickening , NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana prepared on Saturday for a second round of talks with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on a new NATO-Russia relationship . 
the talks on a new charter or treaty to gain Moscow &apos;s backing for the alliance &apos;s plans to expand into former communist central and eastern Europe will take place in Brussels on Sunday . 
NATO , with Moscow &apos;s backing , has imposed a total news blackout on the meeting which authoritative sources say will take place over dinner at Solana &apos;s Brussels residence . 
the meeting , a follow-up to one last month , follows a week of intensive diplomacy which saw the U.S. Secretary of State , and the Italian and German foreign ministers in Moscow . 
on the surface , there has been no progress towards removing Moscow &apos;s determined opposition to enlargement -- an issue which unites Russia &apos;s entire political class . 
but behind Moscow &apos;s strident public rhetoric , alliance diplomats say there has been an acceptance they cannot stop some form of limited enlargement and are about to enter into a real dialogue on an overall NATO-Russia deal . 
NATO intends to invite new members into the alliance that won the Cold War at a summit in Madrid in July . 
at the same summit , they would like to endorse the new NATO-Russia charter . 
but the Western allies have made clear enlargement -- led by Poland , Hungary , and the Czech Republic -- will take place whatever happens . 
&quot; Not to enlarge is the do-nothing , achieve-nothing option . 
it is the option the alliance long ago rejected , &quot; Solana told a conference on European security in Brussels on Friday . 
after weeks of concessions by the allies , Solana -- who has been mandated to negotiate the deal -- is expected to move onto the offensive and push Primakov to detail what Russia can bring to any new relationship . 
&quot; When are they going to ratify START 2 ( a key arms control deal ) , what can they bring to an &apos; open skies &apos; deal , reciprocal consultation and military liaison ? 
he will push them on these , it is not one-way any more , &quot; said one senior diplomat . 
Alliance sources say Solana is also likely to tell Primakov NATO has no objections to an earlier special NATO-Russia summit to formalise the agreement if that is more to Moscow &apos;s liking . 
President Boris Yeltsin inisted in a 15-minute telephone conversation earlier this week with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel that any treaty or charter should be enshrined in a legally-binding document . 
Solana is expected to try and move the debate more on to the content rather than the form of any charter , arguing the document can be flexible and commit states politically without having to go before every country &apos;s parliament . 
&quot; The Helsinki Final Document was not legally binding , but no-one questioned its validity , &quot; said another senior diplomatic source . 
some NATO states , however , are prepared to take legal advice over whether there is some options between a &quot; treaty and a purely political document &quot; . 
Washington &apos;s new Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said talks this week in Rome , Paris , Bonn , Brussels , London and Moscow had brought no breakthrough , but said importaqnt progress had been made towards overcoming Russia &apos;s hostility . 
Primakov repeated Moscow &apos;s opposition but said he wanted to &quot; minimise complications &quot; if NATO &apos;s plan went ahead .
