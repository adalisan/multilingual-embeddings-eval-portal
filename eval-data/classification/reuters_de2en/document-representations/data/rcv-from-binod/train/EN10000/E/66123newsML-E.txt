U.S. and Japanese foreign ministers have agreed that their governments should work to resolve trade disputes over civil aviation and insurance , State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said . 
but there was no formal decisions about how to go about this during a one-hour meeting between Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda at the State Department on Wednesday , he told reporters . 
at a separate briefing , a Japanese spokesman said Ikeda urged the United States to resume talks to settle a dispute over civil aviation rights without any preconditions . 
burns said the trade part of the meeting lasted about 10 minutes . 
the two ministers &quot; talked about civil aviation , insurance , some of the issues that have been difficult in our relationship with Japan , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There were some specific messages passed on both civil aviation and on insurance ... about the inclination of both to try to work hard to resolve some of these trade issues , &quot; he said . 
but &quot; there were no agreements made ... This was not a negotiating session . 
negotiations on aviation rights and a 1952 agreement that Japan says favours the United States broke down last month . 
Washington , which would like an &quot; open skies &quot; accord with Japan , blamed Tokyo for blocking resolution of the dispute . 
the insurance discussion centred on a dispute over a 1994 trade agreement on insurance deregulation in Japan and negotiations taking place this week in Tokyo , Hashimoto said . 
the two ministers met in preparation for Thursday &apos;s meeting of the U.S.-Japan security consultative committee , which also includes U.S. and Japanese defence ministers .
