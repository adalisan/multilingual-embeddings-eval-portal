Governor Chris Patten lashed out at China on Tuesday over a Chinese leader &apos;s claim that Britain has no right to poke its nose into Hong Kong &apos;s affairs after London hands back the territory to Beijing . 
&quot; China makes several solemn commitments to the United Kingdom about how Hong Kong is going to be governed , about how Hong Kong is going to be developed over the 50 years after 1997 , &quot; Patten told reporters after a cabinet meeting . 
&quot; It is natural that Britain shall and will wish to monitor how those commitments are being kept and how the Joint Declaration is being implemented , &quot; he said . 
the British colony reverts to China at midnight on June 30 under a 1984 Sino-British treay , the Joint Declaration , which set out the framework of the sovereignty transfer . 
the freewheeling territory of 6.4 million has been promised a high degree of autonomy and the continuity of its capitalist way of life for a further 50 years . 
Chinese Premier Li Peng said last Friday that Britain should not interfere in Hong Kong after June 30 . 
Patten also criticised a report that the post-colonial government would drop the word &quot; Independent &quot; from the name of the territory &apos;s anti-corruption police , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC ) . 
&quot; It makes clear in the Basic Law that the ICAC should continue to be independent . 
I think if there are impressions that may not be the case , it is important to correct them speedily , &quot; he said . 
more than half of respondents in a recent survey said corruption would be more common among government officials after the July 1 handover .
