new York precious metals ended firmer Tuesday , relieved that the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged as it continued to fret about possible European central bank gold sales . 
after the New York market was closed , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl stepped into the fray over the country &apos;s plan to reevaluate Bundesbank gold by insisting there was no question of selling any of the central bank &apos;s reserves . 
profits creamed from reevaluation pay off debt inherited from the former East Germany , but would not go towards plugging budgetary gaps , Kohl said . 
but dealers were quick to throw cold water on Kohl &apos;s comments . 
it did not matter what the money was used for , the country was calling on hallowed gold reserves for financial help , they said . 
&quot; It &apos;s still just repricing . 
it will be interesting to see how the market reacts . 
gold certainly sighed with relief over interest rates and did not get sold , &quot; Greg Drury of Mitsui USA said . 
Bullion was quoted late afternoon at $ 342.70 / $ 343.20 . 
the dollar weakened further after the U.S. Fed announced no change in interest rates . 
nevertheless , gold is still trapped in a $ 340 to $ 343 an ounce band for spot bullion , with producers nervous at current levels , especially if the bond market rallies . 
some producer selling lay behind Monday &apos;s fall in gold , some dealers believed . 
COMEX silver followed gold all day , with the July contract ending flat at $ 4.713 an ounce , traded $ 4.73 to $ 4.68 . 
the white metals made strong gains as the markets mulled to continued concerns over Russian supplies . 
Boris Ossipov , president of Almaz USA Inc , told Reuters that Russia , a key producer , will finally begin its 1997 exports of platinum group metals from the end of this month or the beginning of June . 
&quot; We don &apos;t doubt they will start exporting metal . 
what we want to know is how much they will export - that &apos;s the crucial issue , &quot; a platinum dealer said . 
if only metal from production and not stockpiles , is shipped , it may still not be enough to avoid further price spikes , he added . 
palladium prices reached their highest since late 1989 . 
Russia supplies 66 percent of world palladium demand , with a chunk of this from stocks . 
NYMEX June palladium settled $ 3.75 firmer at $ 181.75 an ounce , just off the high off $ 181.90 . 
NYMEX July platinum went out $ 4.80 higher at $ 396.00 an ounce , traded $ 397.90 to $ 391.20 .
