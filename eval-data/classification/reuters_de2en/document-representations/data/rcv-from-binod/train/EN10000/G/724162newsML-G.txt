Juan Albert Viloca upset second seed Alex Corretja on Saturday to join Felix Manilla in an all-Spanish final to the Swiss Open . 
Viloca , who claimed his first victory over a top 10 player when he beat number nine Marcelo Rios in the second round , produced an even more impressive performance against fellow Spaniard world number six Corretja , fighting back to record a 3-6 7-6 6-4 win to earn a place in his first career final . 
Mantilla , the sixth seed , advanced to the final for the second consecutive year with a dominating 6-3 6-4 win over eighth seedWayne Ferreira of South Africa . 
no matter what the outcome of Sunday &apos;s final it will mark the sixth time time in seven years that a Spaniard has won the Swiss title . 
after easily winning the first set , Corretja , winner of two tournaments already this season and a finalist in two others , looked poised to finish off his compatriot when he went 5-4 up in the second and was serving for the match . 
but the 24-year-old Viloca , ranked a career high 67 , dug in and got the pivotal break he desperately needed , forcing the set to a tie-break which he won 7-5 . 
&quot; When Corretja was leading and serving for the match , I thought to myself it was going to be tough to comeback , &quot; said Viloca . 
&quot; When I won the second set he started to get tired . 
Viloca took control of the match when he broke Corretja and held serve to go 5-3 up in third . 
hampered by a nasty blister on the second finger of his right hand that required treatment after each of the last three games , Corretja never threatened a comeback as Viloca avenged an earlier defeat by him in his only other semifinal appearance , at Kitzbuehel a year ago . 
&quot; Near the end of the match at 5-3 I came to the net and tried to hit a volley and caught my finger in the grip , &quot; said Corretja . 
&quot; But that wasn &apos;t what decided the match . 
Corretja &apos;s appearance in the final comes as no surprise to Mantilla , who is looking for back-to-back tournament wins after beating French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten in the final in Bologna . 
&quot; We in the Spanish camp always knew he ( Viloca ) had a lot of potential , &quot; said Mantilla . 
&quot; It &apos;s going to be a tough match tomorrow .
