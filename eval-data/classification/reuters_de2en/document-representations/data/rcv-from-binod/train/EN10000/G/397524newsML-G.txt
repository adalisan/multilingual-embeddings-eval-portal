Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Monday marked his return to the helm of power after an illness with a warning that some of his ministers may have to go to help quell rising social strife . 
&quot; Maybe we need some changes , maybe we need some names , maybe we need some people to be changed in the government , &quot; he told Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin during a 50-minute meeting in the Kremlin . 
his remarks were broadcast on television . 
&quot; An opinion poll showed that most Russians were unhappy with the government , the premier and the president ... 
the main thing is that the government cannot cope with ( delayed ) pensions , wages and payments , &quot; said Yeltsin , looking determined and speaking very clearly . 
tell me who needs to be replaced and I will listen to your opinion , &quot; he told Chernomyrdin . 
but he added the main thing was to make government more efficient without racing into ill-considered decisions . 
Yeltsin &apos;s spokesman later said that the president &apos;s anger was not aimed at Chernomyrdin personally and denied rumours that the premier may be in line for sacking . 
&quot; There has been no word about sacking the prime minister , &quot; Interfax news agency quoted spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying . 
Yeltsin &apos;s criticism of the government was greeted cautiously by both liberal and conservative opponents though they clearly had different ministers in mind as those about to get the sack . 
&quot; replacement of some ministers could be the valve which will let go the people &apos;s tension and dissatisfaction , &quot; former Soviet prime minister Nikolai Ryzhkov told Ekho Moskvy radio . 
a vicious circle of non-payments between enterprises , delayed pensions and wages which the government blames on tax-dodging is a huge economic problem for Russia and has sparked strikes and labour protests . 
Yeltsin , who had heart surgery last November , appeared in public on Sunday for the first time since a bout of pneumonia last month in what was clearly intended as a demonstration of his readiness for the political fray . 
asked about attempts by the opposition-dominated parliament to remove him on health grounds , Yeltsin , 66 , growled : &quot; They should know I am a fighter and I remain a fighter . 
they shouldn &apos;t attack me too hard because I can hit back . 
Yeltsin did not elaborate and kept to the lexicon of politics . 
the communists , however , clearly took his words as a reference to 1993 when he set the constitution aside and ordered the Soviet-era parliament to dissolve , accusing deputies of stalling reforms . 
when they refused to obey and supporters staged a bloody rebellion in Moscow , Yeltsin brought tanks into the capital and battered the White House parliament building into submission . 
Viktor Ilyukhin , communist chairman of the security committee in the State Duma lower house , told reporters he was &quot; dispirited &quot; by Yeltsin &apos;s remarks . 
&quot; I am not surprised by his threat because this man has never recognised the constitution , &quot; said Ilyukhin , who is spearheading attempts to unseat Yeltsin for health reasons . 
Gennady Zyuganov , whose Communist Party holds sway in the parliament set up by Yeltsin with limited powers to replace the old legislature , told reporters : &quot; He should have chosen different words after such a serious illness and after what he has done to the country 
&quot; I do not think his threat is realistic and neither the army nor the people will support him , &quot; said Zyuganov , who lost to Yeltsin in July &apos;s presidential election and now wants the constitution amended to dilute presidential powers . 
but Yeltsin , meeting the newly elected head of the Constitutional Court on Monday , reiterated his opposition to any changes in the basic law .
