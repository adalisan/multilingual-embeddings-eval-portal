the New Zealand dollar is picked to fall further after it closed on its lows on Monday , dealers said . 
&quot; It &apos;s not got any strength . 
it &apos;s finishing on its lows and it looks like it could head a little lower overnight . 
it &apos;s still got no rallying ability , &quot; a Wellington bank dealer said . 
the Trade-Weighted Index fell 20 basis points to 64.69 . 
there was importer interest in the morning to sell the New Zealand dollar against the yen and mark . 
pressure was also exerted on the kiwi from a weak Australian dollar , which failed to rally despite the failure of an expected rate cut to materialise as yet . 
Macquarie Bank Chief Economist Bill Shields told Reuters Financial TV that he expects an upward correction in the New Zealand dollar . 
&quot; We think we &apos;ve seen close to the bottom and we would expect the New Zealand dollar to appreciate , one or two cents , over the next three to six months . 
he expects bill yields to rally to more realistic levels . 
&quot; We don &apos;t doubt that the economy may be very close to the bottom in New Zealand but we don &apos;t see a very rapid recovery . 
we see a drawn-out recovery over the next year or two . 
shields said the New Zealand dollar could revisit its lower levels if there was further uncertainty about the policy outlook . 
he expects the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to condone a further easing in monetary conditions in the next three and six months &quot; and probably much more than currently in prospect &quot; .
