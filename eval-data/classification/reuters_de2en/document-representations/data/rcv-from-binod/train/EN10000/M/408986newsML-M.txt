China &apos;s A and B share indices ended mixed in active trading on Thursday on improved sentiment , but profit-taking erased most of the morning &apos;s gains , brokers said . 
the B index rose 0.256 points or 0.38 percent to 66.987 on volume of 19.8 million shares worth $ 9.1 million . 
Shanghai &apos;s B share index rose after a securities official was quoted in the official media as saying he was confident of the development of the market . 
&quot; The news triggered active buying mainly from domestic investors , but overseas investors remained on the sidelines because most firms have yet to release their 1996 results , &quot; said one broker . 
&quot; profit-taking emerged late in the session , wiping out most of the early rises , &quot; another broker said . 
&quot; The index will consolidate around the current level unless some solid measures ( to develop the market ) are taken . 
textile maker Shanghai Haixin was the star on active buying , helped by expectations of an improvement in its 1996 results , rising $ 0.028 , or 6.36 percent , to $ 0.468 on volume of 1.4 million shares . 
blue-chip Shanghai refrigerator compressor traded the most on profit-taking after continued rises over the past few days , falling $ 0.012 , or 2.15 percent , to $ 0.546 on volume of 2.2 million shares . 
the index fell 6.799 points , or 0.63 percentm to 1,071.405 points on volume of 604.1 million shares worth 6.1 billion yuan . 
the SSE30 index lost 10.387 points or 0.37 percent to 2,801.236 points . 
United Hold was the biggest loser , falling 0.26 yuan , or 3.62 percent , to 6.92 yuan on volume of 844,276 million shares . 
Shenzhen &apos;s A-share index ended up on investors &apos; optimism over the market &apos;s medium-term outlook , but profit-taking pushed it off intraday highs , brokers said . 
the A-share index firmed 2.17 points , or 0.58 percent , to close at 379.57 after hitting a high of 384.90 on heavy turnover of 9.67 billion yuan , up from 7.40 billion yuan on Wednesday . 
&quot; optimism over the market &apos;s medium-term outlook fuelled buying , given the stability of China &apos;s economic environment , &quot; an analyst with a major Chinese brokerage said . 
&quot; But profit-taking emerged late in the session , pushing prices off intraday highs . 
brokers said they expected indices to rise next week after some corrections . 
on the Shenzhen B-share market , property concern China Vanke Co was the top gainer , rising HK $ 0.24 , or 3.97 percent , to HK $ 6.29 on volume of 321,600 shares . 
on the A-share market , refrigerator producer Shaanxi Changling advanced 0.33 yuan to 7.27 yuan on the day &apos;s heaviest volume of 27.18 million shares worth 198 million yuan . 
institutions bought the counter on anticipation of good 1996 results , brokers said .
