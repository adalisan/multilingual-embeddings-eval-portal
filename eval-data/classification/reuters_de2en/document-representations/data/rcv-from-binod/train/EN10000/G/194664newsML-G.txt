the party of Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus pulled ahead in Senate elections on Saturday but with turnout at just 35 percent , the real winner was apathy . 
in what was billed as a key test of Klaus &apos;s minority coalition government , candidates of his centre-right Civic Democratic Party ( ODS ) topped voting in 66 of the 71 constituencies declared by mid-evening . 
but most face a second round run-off on November 22-23 for the newly-created upper house , and analysts said the dismal turnout vindicated more the far-right Republicans , who boycotted the elections and told fellow Czechs to do likewise . 
nationwide figures were not available . 
but the Central Election Commission said turnout in 53 of the 81 constituencies had been just 34.27 percent . 
this was far lower than forecast and compared with 76.4 percent participation in lower house elections held in June . 
Klaus , the father of Czech economic reform , played down the voter apathy and played up the ODS performance following his electoral disaster last June , when strong Social Democrat gains stripped his three-party coalition of its lower house majority . 
&quot; From the results so far it is obvious that the citizens of this country understand that they want stability , &quot; he told reporters , alluding to the political stalemate which has stalled reform since the inconclusive lower house polls . 
&quot; These elections ... are an important test of the political feelings of people of this country about the ( June ) elections . 
in this respect they are giving an important signal , &quot; he said . 
under the Senate rules , candidates who fail to win over half the first round vote have to face the runner-up in a second round . 
most constituencies will be decided next weekend . 
but already it appears the Social Democrats of economist Milos Zeman have done badly , failing to come out on top in a single constituency . 
Zeman , whose party has been afflicted by squabbling , appeared to blame the low turnout for the poor result . 
but he added : &quot; I firmly believe that in the second round , participation will be markedly higher because then it is a choice between the two strongest candidates . 
in the end the Republicans led by doctor of philosophy Miroslav Sladek came out looking best without even running . 
Sladek hit a chord by denouncing the Senate as a waste of time and money . 
&quot; They had nowhere to dump the political zombies so they established the Senate , &quot; he told a recent rally . 
polls showed few Czechs understand the function of the Senate , which has little power compared with the lower Chamber of Deputies . 
with a few exceptions , most of the candidates are little known because Czech leaders all sit in the lower house . 
conventional wisdom has been that if ODS did well in the Senate , Klaus might provoke early lower house polls to regain the coalition &apos;s majority , although he denies that . 
but ODS is better at mobilising support than the Social Democrats when interest is low . 
&quot; If there is a low turnout , even if Klaus wins , I think that it would be very difficult for the ODS to know the real mood of the country , &quot; said Jiri Pehe , research director at the Open Media Research Institute ( OMRI ) .
