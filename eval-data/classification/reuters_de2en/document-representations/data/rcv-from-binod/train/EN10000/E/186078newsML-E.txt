bear Stearns economist David Malpass said he saw Brazil as a turnaround economy that would continue to move &quot; decidedly forward &quot; in 1997 if business , government and consumers behaved with self confidence . 
speaking to reporters , Malpass forecast Brazil would grow around five percent next year , with inflation hovering at a level between eight and nine percent . 
the average dollar-real parity would be of 1.07 reais and end the year at 1.10 reais , he said . 
&quot; We see the issues in 1997 in terms of self confidence , &quot; said Malpass , a former U.S. Bush administration Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Economic Affairs . 
&quot; So far consumers have shown confidence . 
1997 is the year when the government and business can build confidently on what has already been achieved . 
as the major obstacles to be overcome , Malpass pointed to the government &apos;s difficulty in closing a fiscal deficit and an overreliance on tariffs barriers to control a swelling trade deficit . 
&quot; ( Brazil ) doesn &apos;t have to balance its books . 
but it must show that it continues making progress , &quot; said Malpass refering to the operational fiscal deficit , which is forecast at 3.6 percent of GDP for 1996 . 
&quot; Fiscal progress is key . 
currently ( the situation ) is less than ideal , &quot; he said . 
Malpass said that without these problems , his forecast for Brazilian growth would have been seven percent for next year . 
contradicting most local analysts , Malpass said he was not overly concerned by Brazil &apos;s negative trade balance , which he said should reach $ 7 billion in 1997 , up from a forecast $ 3.5 billion this year . 
he said the rule of thumb was that the trade deficit in a fast-growing developing nation should be at least equivalent to foreign direct investment . 
Brazilian 1996 direct investment is forecast at $ 9 billion . 
&quot; The trade deficit should be bigger than FDI ( foreign direct investment ) ; otherwise , companies are using local resources to build economic development , &quot; said Malpass . 
he also shrugged off suggestions that an out of control trade deficit could trigger a Mexican-style currency crisis . 
interest rates are high and yet you still have growth , &quot; he said adding those were not signs the Brazilian economy was under threat . 
&quot; Brazil is a turnaround story that is still going decidedly forward , &quot; said Malpass .
