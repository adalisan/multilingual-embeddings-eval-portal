Thai rubber prices were steady to slightly higher this week despite thin demand as supplies dropped sharply , trade sources said on Friday . 
heavy rains in the south substantially cut supplies from around the area , they said , 
only about 62,961 kg of sheet rubber entered the market , a 83.5 percent drop from a week earlier , according to auction market sources . 
the Thai benchmark RSS3 for January shipment was quoted around $ 1.23-1.24 a kg fob Bangkok compared with $ 1.23 last week . 
STR20 for January shipment was quoted around $ 1.22- $ 1.23 on the same basis . 
traders said China and Japan entered the market this week but in moderate quantity . 
but many expected the prices to move with an upward bias next week . 
&quot; The tight supplies and news that Japan rubber stocks at end of November fell should help bouy the prices , &quot; said one hat Yai trader .
