U.S. ambassador Thomas Simons has praised the economic reform plans of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif &apos;s government , but said their success was not guaranteed . 
Simons said in a speech in Lahore on Monday that measures to spur growth and exports through tax and tariff cuts could &quot; carry the economy towards solid , self- reliant prosperity &quot; . 
&quot; But these same reforms represent a serious challenge to old economic and business habits , and the risks of failure are substantial , &quot; the ambassador cautioned . 
Sharif unveiled his reform package on March 28 , shortly after the International Monetary Fund halted a standby loan negotiated by a caretaker government before Sharif &apos;s Pakistan Muslim League swept to power in February 3 elections . 
the IMF , which stopped the loan when it became clear that Pakistan would not meet its fiscal targets , tentatively agreed to start talks on a new , medium-term loan later in the year . 
finance Minister Sartaj Aziz , seeking $ 2.26 billion from foreign donors for 1997 / 98 ( July-June ) , was to present his plans to an Aid-to-Pakistan consortium meeting in Paris on Tuesday . 
Simons said the United States , as Pakistan &apos;s biggest trade partner with two-way trade worth $ 2.4 billion in 1995 / 96 , had a keen interest in the success of Sharif &apos;s reform package . 
he said foreign direct investment in Pakistan had shown a positive trend , rising above $ 1 billion in 1995 / 96 , but this represented only a relatively low one percent share in total foreign direct investment in all developing countries . 
foreign investors , he suggested , had taken Sharif &apos;s success in the polls as signalling a period of political stability . 
&quot; The government can send additional signals to investors by reforming its economic structures , by improving domestic law and order , by moving aggressively on good governance and by investing seriously in Pakistan &apos;s own future , &quot; he added . 
Simons said the government should monitor imports closely to ensure that tariff cuts did not lead to an import surge . 
tax cuts should be matched by efforts to broaden the tax base . 
&quot; Success in implementing the tax proposals ... will also depend on efforts to restore good governance , the lack of which , as much as anything else , has hobbled Pakistan &apos;s efforts to transform its political and economic institutions . 
he said Sharif had given the private sector a chance to prove wrong those who believed it was &quot; too deeply embedded in a culture of tax evasion to respond to the prime minister &apos;s call &quot; . 
Simons argued that if Pakistan was to emulate the export-led growth of the Asian economic &quot; tigers &quot; it would have to provide good basic education and health care to create a skilled labour pool . 
&quot; If the children of Pakistan do not have books rather than bricks in their hands , in 10 years who will work in the industries Pakistan will need to be an Asian tiger ? 
&quot; If the children of Pakistan today sweat over looms instead of over math tests , who will pay the taxes on which tomorrow &apos;s governments of Pakistan will run ? 
&quot; the American envoy asked .
