President Franjo Tudjman &apos;s order last week to round up Croat nationalist gangsters was part of a plan to salvage his party &apos;s image , shift it towards the political centre and avert electoral defeat , analysts say . 
the criminals were widely resented for their distorting influence on Croatian politics and business . 
moderates in Tudjman &apos;s Croatian Democratic Union ( HDZ ) have replaced rightists , especially Herzegovinians , as slate-topping candidates in key regional elections next month , another sign of an apparent move away from radical nationalism . 
commentators said Tudjman hoped to siphon pivotal urban votes away from centrist opposition parties , entice them into coalitions with the HDZ to help it cling to power and secure his place in history as a pro-Europe moderniser . 
he has also co-opted opposition issues used to hammer HDZ credibility of late , promising to improve living standards and end abuses of power by offering big pension and pay increases and cracking down on corruption . 
a new poll on the April 13 communal elections shows the HDZ with just under 30 percent and the main two-party rival bloc at 35 percent . 
diplomats say Tudjman might even shuffle his government to include opposition leaders after presidential elections this summer which the charismatic elderly strongman , who is much more popular than his party , is widely tipped to win . 
&quot; Tudjman may be getting around to the idea , regardless of campaign-motivated vitriol against the opposition , that Croatia must reposition itself towards the centre to become prosperous and integrated in Europe , &quot; a senior Western diplomat said . 
&quot; He now faces certain defeat of his party on its own . 
he can only hope for relative majorities , so to stay in power he needs coalition partners -- another reason for approaching the centre , &quot; he added . 
other diplomats believe Tudjman , 74 , has been chastened by a recent bout with cancer and wants to improve Croatia &apos;s image in the West before he steps down . 
&quot; Tudjman may be concerned about how the history books will portray him . 
he has this historic vision about an independent , prosperous and well-respected Croatia , &quot; a Western envoy said . 
&quot; He cannot afford internationally to do the same thing as ( Serbian President Slobodan ) Milosevic -- simply annulling adverse election results , &quot; he said . 
domestic analyst Davor Gjenero said Tudjman &apos;s moves looked cosmetic . 
HDZ nationalists still controlled a big chunk of the state budget through their grip on the defence ministry and held two-thirds of the party &apos;s seats in parliament , he said . 
but diplomats said the arrest of Bosnian Croat mobsters who enjoyed close contacts to Croatian officialdom might have been the most important single step towards political moderation in Croatia since independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 . 
Herzegovinian gangs have terrorised Moslems in western Bosnia and virtually run a separatist Croat entity in the region , miring Croatia in Bosnia &apos;s intractable ethnic strife and tarnishing the HDZ in Western eyes . 
Herzegovinian Croats have wielded a disproportionate role in Croatian politics and big business , causing deep resentment among ordinary Croatians . 
defence Minister Gojko Susak , the second most powerful man in Croatia , is a Herzegovinian . 
but top Herzegovinians and other rightists are now missing from key election slates . 
in their place are centrists and technocrats who tend to back democratic reform , co-existence with minority Serbs and integration with the European Union .
