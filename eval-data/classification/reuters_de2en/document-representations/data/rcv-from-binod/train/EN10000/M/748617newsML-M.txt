the UK &apos;s FTSE 100 share index ended higher on Wednesday but towards the lowest levels of the day , after a dramatic climb on the back of Wall Street &apos;s latest record petered out towards the close . 
the leading index had climbed as high as 4,931.5 in early trade to notch up an 85 point gain . 
but by the close the FTSE stood a modest 27.8 points higher at 4,874.5 . 
&quot; Market makers were too quick to hike up prices this morning ... the volume didn &apos;t justify an 80 point gain , &quot; one dealer commented . 
&quot; We had a very good rally on the back of Wall Street but what is more interesting is that it didn &apos;t last .
