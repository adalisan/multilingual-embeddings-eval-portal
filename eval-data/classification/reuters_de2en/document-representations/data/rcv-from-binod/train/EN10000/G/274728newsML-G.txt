the International Red Cross said on Tuesday there were 106 hostages being held by Marxist guerrillas inside the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence instead of the 140 previously thought . 
the crisis began with the taking of more than 400 hostages at a diplomatic reception a week ago . 
&quot; There are 106 hostages on the official list , &quot; Red Cross official Jean-Pierre sharer told reporters outside the residence . 
&quot; There was a little confusion at first about how many hostages there were with the release ( on Sunday night ) of 225 persons , &quot; sharer added as he supervised efforts to re-establish a water supply to the ambassador &apos;s mansion . 
water , electricity and telephone lines to the residence have been cut off since the second day of the hostage crisis . 
Michel Minnig , the coordinator of Red Cross operations , said after the release of 225 men on Sunday night that about 140 remained inside but added that the figure could later be revised . 
officials said they have been trying to locate seven men who were released on Sunday night but were not checked off on Red Cross lists as they left the residence . 
at least two men were thought to have walked through police lines without boarding buses that took the majority of the freed men to a nearby police hospital for a medical checkup . 
sharer said the new figure of hostages was made after members of the organisation talked to everyone inside the residence . 
about 20 heavily-armed Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) rebels stormed a cocktail party at the ambassador &apos;s house Dec . 17 , taking hundreds of guests hostage . 
the rebels released all women and many of the young and elderly on the first night of the siege . 
subsequently , they released 38 men on Friday night and 225 more as a Christmas goodwill gesture on Sunday night . 
the MRTA guerrillas have said they will only release their remaining captives if the government frees about 400 of their jailed comrades . 
Peru &apos;s President Alberto Fujimori has rejected their demands and promised not to storm the building if the guerrillas put down their arms and freed all their hostages .
