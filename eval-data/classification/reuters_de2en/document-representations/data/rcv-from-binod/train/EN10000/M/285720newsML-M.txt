U.S. refiners seemed reluctant to take North Sea crude cargoes on offer Friday amid slim downstream margins , traders said . 
the spread between February West Texas Intermediate and North Sea Brent was around $ 1.50-55 a barrel late Friday , up around five cents from late Thursday , maintaining the open trans-Atlantic arbitrage . 
several Wall Street players are offering Brent cargoes for early February arrival to the Gulf Coast at February West Texas Intermediate minus 25 cents , trade sources said . 
&quot; It &apos;s got to be at least 40 cents ( under WTI ) to get our attention , &quot; one refiner said . 
the open arbitrage and slim margins , meanwhile , have taken a toll on other regional crudes , such as Colombia &apos;s Cusiana . 
British Petroleum sold a 550,000 barrel cargo of Cusiana to a Gulf Coast refiner for delivery January 23-24 at a premium of 10 cents to March WTI , traders said . 
before Christmas , Cusiana was fetching a premium of around 40 cents , traders said . 
BP has a second cargo on offer for January 31 to February 1 at around the same price , trade sources said . 
in other Latin American activity , Uruguay &apos;s state-owned oil company ANCAP bought asphaltic crude for delivery February 12-14 in a private spot transaction with Venezuela , trade sources said . 
ANCAP bought BCF-24 crude from Lagoven , a unit of state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela , they said . 
the cargo of around 500,000 barrels will load between January 30 and February 2 , they said . 
traders speculated that ANCAP paid around $ 5.00 a barrel under benchmark West Texas Intermediate for the cargo . 
Uruguay normally buys around one million barrels a year of such crude for asphalt , and has previously bought heavy Saudi and Iranian crudes , traders said . 
in the U.S. aftermarket , a series of partial February Brent cargoes changed hands at $ 24.18 and 24.20 a barrel , up nine to 11 cents from the IPE settlement . 
Intermonth spreads were also stronger . 
Feb / Mar Brent traded at 52 / 53 cents , up four to five cents from the London close .
