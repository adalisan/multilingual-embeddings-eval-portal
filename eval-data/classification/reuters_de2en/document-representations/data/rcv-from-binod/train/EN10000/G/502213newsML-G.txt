a Sudanese official charged in comments published on Friday that Eritrean forces had attacked areas in northeastern Sudan and were holding prisoners . 
the privately-owned Akhbar al-Youm newspaper quoted Mohamad Adam Hagoab , head of the transport and communications committee in the Sudanese parliament , as saying the attacks took place near the border with Eritrea . 
Khartoum &apos;s Islamist government has accused Eritrea , Ethiopia and Uganda of fighting alongside northern and southern rebels to overthrow President Omar Hassan al-Bashir . 
all three countries deny the charge . 
the rebel coalition under the command of Sudan People &apos;s Liberation Army ( SPLA ) leader John Garang has said it is behind the fighting in Sudan &apos;s northeast and southern areas . 
&quot; Eritrean forces continue to hold a big number of citizens in the mountain areas which fall between the border and the areas of Karora and Hibarna , &quot; Hagoab said . 
Garang said in a statement earlier this month that rebels had seized several northeastern districts in an offensive to cut the road between Khartoum and Sudan &apos;s main link to the outside world at Port Sudan on the Red Sea . 
Hagoab said : &quot; The Eritrean forces which attacked the eastern areas with limited backing from Garang &apos;s forces have undertaken the killing of some personalities in the area . 
first Vice President Lieutenant General al-Zubeir Mohammad Saleh ordered newly appointed state ministers and commissioners to spend next week &apos;s Moslem religious holiday EID al-Adha at the frontline to boost army morale . 
&quot; The state shall ask them to head for the frontlines and operation area to spend the EID holiday with the Mujahideen ( holy warriors ) and to stand with them in one bunker , &quot; Akbhar al-Youm quoted Saleh as saying .
