the total German government deficit , including federal , state and local debt , expanded in the 1996 second quarter to 23.5 billion marks from 16.5 billion marks a year earlier , the Bundesbank said . 
the German central bank said in its monthly report for September , published Thursday , that a slowdown in the development of tax inflows and the weak economy , coupled with changes in German tax laws , had helped lead to the deficit . 
the report said the Bundesbank projected the full-year total German government deficit could rise above the 110 billion marks in 1995 . 
at the federal level , the Bundesbank said the deficit during the second quarter doubled to 16.5 billion marks from almost eight billion marks in the year-ago period . 
inflows to the government fell by almost six percent while outflows rose 2.5 percent . 
the report said the inflow of tax revenues during the second quarter was 2.5 percent below year-ago levels . 
in particular , recent changes to tax laws for 1996 led to a drop of about 12 percent in wage tax inflows during the second quarter , including a drop of about 11 billion marks due to changes in laws relating to children . 
but the report said inflows from tax assessments on wages not paid on a monthly basis had risen . 
on a seven-month basis from January to July , the Bundesbank said tax revenue inflows fell 2.6 percent while expectations for the full year predict a drop of 1.4 percent .
