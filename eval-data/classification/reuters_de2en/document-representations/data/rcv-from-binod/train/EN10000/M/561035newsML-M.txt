European cotton consumers are seeking nearby raw material but origin offers are thinning ahead of 1997 / 98 new crops , a fortnightly market report from the Bremen Cotton Exchange said on Monday . 
but it noted some trade sales from local stocks . 
despite the tight nearby situation , buyers were not yet keen on 1997 / 98 contracts , mostly due to the strong dollar versus the mark . 
buyers were also inclined to await Latin American crops , which are now due to be shipped , while West African shipments were delayed . 
the Exchange circulated upland offers from Central Asia , West Africa , Israel and Syria for second quarter through 1997 and , in some cases , first half 1998 . 
it also reported longstaple sales in Central Asian , Sudanese , Israeli and U.S. Pima grades for a variety of 1997 and 1998 dates . 
cotton stocks as of April 30 totalled 41,504 bales , down from 126,250 a year and 45,980 bales a fortnight earlier .
