Switzerland &apos;s new ambassador to the United States said on Sunday it would take years for his country &apos;s image to recover after the recent furore over Swiss behaviour during World War Two . 
the envoy , Alfred Defago who had previously been Consul-General in New York , was speaking in an interview with the German-language newspaper Sonntagszeitung . 
&quot; previously , Switzerland &apos;s image ( in the United States ) was good with no problems , &quot; said Defago , whose predecessor Carlo Jagmetti stepped down after saying the country was faced with waging war against its U.S. and Jewish detractors . 
&quot; Now suddenly people are confronted with an unknown side of Switzerland , &quot; Defago added . 
&quot; For the media , it was of course interesting to put a spotlight on the dark side of the star pupil . 
&quot; It will take major efforts , outside of just the diplomatic channels , to restore Switzerland &apos;s image . 
this will not take months but rather several years at least , &quot; the Swiss diplomat declared . 
U.S. congressmen and Jewish leaders have accused Switzerland of holding on to funds deposited by German Jews who later died in Nazi camps as well as acting as a conduit for gold stolen by the Nazis from occupied countries during the war . 
Swiss economy minister and then rotating president Jean-Pascal Delamuraz caused a storm at the end of last year when he said the country was being blackmailed by world Jewish leaders into setting up a fund to compensate Holocaust victims . 
he later apologised and the Swiss government has moved to ensure creation of a credible fund . 
in New York last Friday , major participants in the row publicly declared an end to their confrontation as the United States offered its help in setting up the fund . 
a meeting between Jewish leaders and Swiss , Israeli and U.S. officials ended with participants hailing a new spirit of cooperation to resolve what has been called the last chapter of the Holocaust -- a battle over how to compensate victims . 
Jewish organisations had been considering calling for a boycott by Jews around the world of Swiss banks . 
&quot; Things are back on track after getting out of hand and emotional , &quot; World Jewish Congress President Edgar Bronfman said , at a news conference in which he was flanked by the chief U.S. and Swiss officials dealing with the issue . 
earlier , Switzerland &apos;s chief critic in the U.S. Senate , Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse D &apos;Amato , had declared himself satisfied a new page had been turned in Swiss-Jewish relations . 
d &apos;Amato , who for weeks had been accusing Swiss bankers of acting as Hitler &apos;s money-launderers , praised the new spirit of cooperation evident at the meeting , made possible by the creation of the fund . 
the Swiss government , which six weeks ago said it would never establish such a fund , announced earlier in the week that it would take over a private $ 71 million fund set up by the country &apos;s three biggest banks and work with the WJC and Swiss Jews to set up a mechanism for its &quot; timely distribution .
