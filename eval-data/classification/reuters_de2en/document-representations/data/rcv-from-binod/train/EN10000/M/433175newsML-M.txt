gas oil and jet fuel held firm as a Singapore trader continued its buying spree , traders said on Tuesday . 
after having bought about 1.2 million barrels of gas oil over the past two weeks , the trader bought another 500,000 barrels on Tuesday . 
it bought two cargoes at $ 27.80 a barrel and $ 26.65 for end-March and early April respectively from a European major and another cargo at $ 26.75 for April 6-10 liftings fob from another European major as planned . 
traders said some cargo movements have been seen from Hong Kong into southern China as inventory levels were starting to dip from their very high levels earlier in the year . 
they said some arbitrage cargoes coming to Asia from Europe and Russia were expected to arrive in Hong Kong to meet Chinese demand .

the trader also bought two jet fuel cargoes from the first European major at $ 28.60 and $ 27.50 , fob for end-March and April 6-10 liftings respectively . 
some traders said the buyer would cease their purchases by the end of this week , while others said it would continue into early next week . 
traders said Indonesia has not yet emerged to buy gas oil and jet fuel for April deliveries . 
they said Indonesia &apos;s projected demand would depend on whether or not they would be able to initiate their phased restart of the 125,000-barrel-per-day ( bpd ) Balongan refinery from March 15-17
