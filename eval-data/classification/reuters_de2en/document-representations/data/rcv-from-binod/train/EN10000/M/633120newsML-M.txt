White sugar futures held onto most of the gains notched up during the morning &apos;s fund-led buying spree as the nearby August contract motored higher and towards fresh upside targets . 
earlier , a renewed bout of fund buying pushed August over $ 330 a tonne , building on the rally seen in late activity on Monday . 
&quot; All the buying is coming into the August , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; If suddenly other people start coming out and buying sugar at these levels , then you have to say the levels are justified . 
by 1530 GMT all positions were firmer and hovering close to intraday highs . 
August stood up $ 2.20 at $ 330.00 having moved in a wide $ 3.20 ranges . 
October was up $ 2.00 at $ 320.50 and volume reached a hefty 3,598 lots , dominated by August . 
market sources cited a sprinkling of crossed and against actuals trades which boosted the total volume . 
the funds had been lured by August &apos;s good liquidity and strong technical picture , they said , noting that the rally had also pushed August into overbought territory -- opening up the possibility of a technical correction . 
analysts pegged August &apos;s next resistance points at $ 333.50 , followed by $ 341.00 . 
traders also mentioned a fair amount of Brazilian pricing in the London market , as well in New York . 
Russian physical demand is still a talking point but details of actual purchases have been scarce due to the small amounts of white sugar reported to be trickling into Baltic and Black Sea ports . 
&quot; If Russia keeps buying , the chances are August could still be fairly tight and a lot of the pricing that &apos;s been put in there may end up having to be put back , &quot; the trader said . 
trading in Paris was also dominated by August , which was up $ 2.40 at $ 329.00 . 
October was untraded and MATIF volume totalled 494 lots .
