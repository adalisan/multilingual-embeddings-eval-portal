the Istanbul gold exchange &apos;s futures market saw quiet trade on its first day on Friday , though dealers said they were pleased with the level of demand . 
if the depth of volume was not great , the spreads were in place and the market moved in parallel with international markets , &quot; said Vedat Guven of Toprakbank . 
a total of 43 contracts , all in dollar terms , were concluded in the market &apos;s first day , led by 22 contracts for September and 15 for December . 
&quot; Traders and investors in general preferred to wait and see because it was the first day . 
but there was strong interest from customers and the spreads fell to around 20 cents which was positive . 
most of the contracts were made by banks taking up positions , &quot; said one banker . 
September contracts last traded at $ 325.90 an ounce , with that of October at $ 327 and December at $ 327.20 . 
Kaan Aytogu , general secretary of the gold exchange said the initial trade was above the previous expectations . 
trading in lira- or dollar-based gold futures takes place between 1100 and 1600 local ( 0800-1300 GMT ) on the market . 
Aytogu said Kocbank , Turk Ekonomi Bank , Yapi Kredi Bank , Toprakbank and precious metals brokerage Kumova were the most active traders on the first day of trade . 
&quot; The low operation cost , high liquidity and short selling opportunity on the futures market will allow the jewellery sector as well as other domestic and foreign investors to hedge themselves against exchange and interest rate fluctuations in T-bill and share investments , &quot; Aytogu told Reuters . 
&quot; Our next target is to open a currency futures market , &quot; he added .
