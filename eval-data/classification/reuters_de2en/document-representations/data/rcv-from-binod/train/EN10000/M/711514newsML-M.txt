gold &apos;s extremely oversold position on a 14-day relative Strength Indicator and downside targets suggested by a February-June triangle indicate that the yellow metal &apos;s price slide could be stopped in the coming days , Belgian independent chartist Frank Boll said on Monday . 
&quot; Gold has fallen below an 11-year old support in the $ 325 to $ 340 area , that is extremely bearish . 
those who have gold better sell it , &quot; he told Reuters . 
but a first downside target at $ 320 had been reached and the next move could be sideways to upwards . 
he said the long-term trend remained negative . 
at 1430 GMT gold was at $ 318 per ounce after falling to as low as $ 314 , continuing a slide that started on June 27 . 
Boll said the February 12-June 26 triangle on the chart XAU = with a support base line at $ 340 and a falling hypotenuse with a $ 363 high on March 3 had indicated a first downside target at around $ 320 following the break of the support line on June 27 . 
this target is calculated by subtracting from the support line the same distance ( about $ 20 ) as between the top of the formation at $ 363 and the support at $ 340 . 
a break-out in the direction of the hypotenuse had a strong probability , he said . 
Boll said that in a large triangle formation like that , prospective demand below the $ 340 area is gradually weeded out as the formation progresses , while supply increases in line with the falling hypotenuse . 
he added that the possibility of a sideways to upwards correction to the fall since June 27 was supported by gold &apos;s extremely oversold position . 
the 14-day RSI on the daily chart now stands at 16.7 , well outside the normal 30-70 band . 
a previous low at 14 on January 6 was also followed by a sideways correction lasting several days . 
but this does not mean that the long-term slide is over . 
Boll said that on the weekly chart the 14-week RSI stood only at 26 , compared to a low of 12 in the February sell-off , indicating that the downtrend could go further . 
looking at the long-term trend , Boll said the chart picture was very bearish . 
a strong support line in the $ 330 area has been visited three times : in 1986 , 1993 and 1997 . 
he said it made little sense to find a long-term downside target , but added that as long as gold did not significantly move back to above $ 340 , the trend would remain downwards .
