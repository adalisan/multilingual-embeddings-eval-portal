Australian growth is likely to accelerate this year with a prudent monetary policy framework helping keep inflation subdued , Moody &apos;s Investors Service said in an indepth Analysis Report released on Tuesday . 
Moody &apos;s said the report did not represent a rating change , nor did it indicate that Australia had been put on watch for a potential rating change . 
rather , it said its purpose was to reflect an updated view of Australia &apos;s current position . 
on July 2 , Moody &apos;s said it changed Australia &apos;s ratings outlook to positive from stable . 
Australia has a current long term rating of Aa2 . 
the report said the main medium term challenge for Australia was to contain the growth of external debt , a front on which it said some positive developments were beginning to emerge . 
over the 1997 / 98 year to June 30 , Moody &apos;s said it expected a pickup in the pace of economic activity . 
housing , capital expenditure and non-residential construction were expected to be positive contributors to growth with some improvement in consumer spending expected over the second half of 1997 . 
net exports would remain a detraction on growth , despite a strengthening of conditions in external markets , although this detraction will not be as great as in 1996 / 97 , Moody &apos;s said . 
on the labour market , the slower pace of economic growth since 1995 had prevented the sustaining of significant employment gains , with restructuring in the public and private sector expected to continue to dampen employment prospects . 
&quot; Nonetheless , job vacancy and the anticipated pick-up in economic activity should lead to some job gains and a gradual decline in unemployment over the next 12 months , &quot; said the report , prepared in New York . 
one distinct characteristic of the current cycle that could help prolong the current expansion was the absence of strong inflationary pressures , Moody &apos;s said . 
with falling inflation from mid-1996 , and more subdued inflation expectations , the Reserve Bank of Australia had been able to chart a more accomodating policy stance which had seen official rates fall by 200 basis points to 5.50 percent . 
&quot; Supported by more moderate wage advances and the effects of global competition , inflation performance should remain favourable in 1997 / 98 , providing the Reserve Bank with the scope to maintain its pro-growth policy stance , &quot; the report said . 
the report also said the government expected to end 1996 / 97 with an underlying deficit of A $ 6.9 billion , or 1.3 percent of GDP , which although higher than the original target was still a &quot; considerable improvement &quot; over the A $ 10.3 billion deficit ( 2.1 percent of GDP ) in 1995 / 96 . 
Moody &apos;s said that although growth had a positive impact , much of this fiscal improvement represented aggressive saving measures in the 1996 budget . 
the report said this gain would be mainly due to economic growth and budgetary measures from the 1996 budget . 
Moody &apos;s said the main medium term challenge for Australia was containing the growth of external debt by avoiding undue reliance on foreign capital to finance investment activity . 
&quot; On that front , positive developments are beginning ot emerge with the introduction of a fiscal policy framework that is supportive of higher levels of national savings , &quot; it said . 
the current account deficit has averaged about four percent of GDP over the last two years , down from six percent in 1994 / 95 . 
Moody &apos;s expected the deficit to remain around four percent provided developing drought conditions are contained . 
&quot; Should a serious drought problem develop , reduced farm exports would likely result in a higher deficit but within the four to five percent band , &quot; the report said .
