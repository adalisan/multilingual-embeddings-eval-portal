the world price of copper seemed this week to have settled into a new slightly higher range after languishing below $ 2,000 per tonne since the Sumitomo Corp scandal in mid-June . 
but views were mixed on how far it might rally and on how long it could hold above that psychological threshold . 
copper tumbled in June from around $ 2,700 as Sumitomo of Japan fired its star trader , Yasuo Hamanaka , who had been defending a long position in the market . 
it alleged he ran up losses of $ 1.8 billion on unauthorised trades . 
Options-related selling on Wednesday knocked London Metal Exchange ( LME ) three-months copper briefly down to $ 1,990 . 
but it then met good buying and short covering and ended the London afternoon around $ 2,020 . 
in the short-term , resistance is now pegged at the recent 2-1 / 2 month high of $ 2,165 , followed by $ 2,200 , analysts said . 
but brokerage GNI Ltd said in a special report that the longer term prospect was less buoyant . 
rising copper production and the possibility that consumption growth forecasts will be too optimistic put the market on course for surpluses this year and next , it said . 
&quot; GNI believes that the world copper market will see a surplus of around 189,000 tonnes in 1996 , 150,000 tonnes of which will come in the second half of the year , &quot; GNI said . 
&quot; In 1997 , preliminary indications suggest that the surplus will rise to around 450,000 tonnes , &quot; it added . 
China remains the great unknown in the market place , after recent years of considerable activity with state reserve stockpile liquidation and re-purchase having become commonplace . 
&quot; At present , there is talk of both the sale of 150,000 tonnes and gossip about the possibility of a large stock drawdown in September , &quot; GNI said . 
however , the market should focus on stock movements on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) , as recent increases suggest an annualised rise of over 600,000 tonnes . 
&quot; If stocks continue to build at this rate it will offset any movements made by China &quot; . 
the new U.S. hostilities against Iraq continued to leave commodity markets outside the petroleum sector unmoved . 
gold lost $ 1.0 an ounce on disappointment that it had failed to rally , either because it no longer enjoyed its traditional &quot; safe haven &quot; role in time of tension , or because nobody was worried enough about the Middle East to feel they needed one . 
other commodity prices were also mostly flat . 
benchmark Chicago Board of Trade ( CBOT ) wheat futures were scarely changed on the day at around $ 4.50 a bushel . 
coffee eased but recovered on bargain-hunting . 
London cocoa ended firm after briefly sliding to six-month low .
