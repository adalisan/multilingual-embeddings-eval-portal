stocks rose Friday , led by a surge in transportation shares which finally showed signs of emerging from their summer-long malaise . 
in the broader market , advancing issues led declines 11 to eight on active volume of 332 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
the Dow Jones Transportation Index soared 31.68 points , or 1.53 percent , to 2,095.58 . 
the Nasdaq composite index gained 6.61 points to 1,218.70 . 
since the broad market sell-off in early July , several indices , most notably the Dow , have recouped their losses and pushed through to new record levels . 
however , as a group , the transports have largely failed to participate in the recovery . 
&quot; When you get further and further into a rally , you start to look at the laggards , &quot; said Gregory NIE , technical analyst at Everen Securities . 
&quot; One of the laggards has been the transport index . 
even as the transportation sector played catch-up , some broader indices hit new highs early Friday in a rally that analysts said seems to be picking up steam . 
the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s index of 500 stocks gained 3.07 to 686.07 after reaching a record 687.07 in earlier trade . 
&quot; The S &amp; P 100 is breaking out to the upside and that is a very bullish sign , &quot; said Scott Bleier , chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd . 
Bleier noted , however , that the S &amp; P 100 , like the Dow industrials , is comprised of the very large capitalisation stocks that have become investor favourites of late . 
&quot; We have seen some filtering down to small-cap names but this rally continues to be selective , &quot; Bleier said . 
the heavy trading volume generally would have been viewed as another bullish sign . 
but analysts attibuted much of the volume to the &quot; triple witching &quot; expiration of options and futures , which inflate volume levels and occasionally produce temporary price fluctuations . 
among individual issues , Hughes electronics Corp. jumped 3-3 / 8 to 61-1 / 8 after the company announced it would acquire satellite concern Panamsat Corp. for $ 30 per share . 
shares in PanAmSat were unchanged at 27-3 / 4 . 
Houston Exploration Co . , a natural gas exploration unit of Brooklyn Union Gas Co . , gained 1-1 / 2 to 17 on its first day of trading . 
shares in Brooklyn Union , which offered 7.1 million shares in the unit , rose 1 / 4 to 27-1 / 4 . 
America Online Inc. rose 2 to 35-1 / 8 . 
the shares have gained more than 8 since the company &apos;s NYSE debut on Monday .
