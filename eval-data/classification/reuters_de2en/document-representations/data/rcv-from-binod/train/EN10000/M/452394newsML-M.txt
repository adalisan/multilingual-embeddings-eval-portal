London &apos;s white sugar futures market perked up after its dismal start to Wednesday &apos;s session but although outright trades boosted turnover ranges still remained tight across the board . 
the whites market took its cue to move lower after light sell stops were triggered at 10.75 cents / lb basis the May raws contract , traders said . 
&quot; It &apos;s just following New York ... and the whites have gone down with it , &quot; said one trader , noting a mixed bag of players engaged in mostly outright dealings . 
the May arbitrage widened out to around $ 68.50 , with sellers said to be waiting in the wings at $ 69 and above . 
interest was noted in the further forward premiums but the rangebound levels were discouraging actual trades . 
at 1655 GMT May was up 10 cents at $ 306.40 and August down 20 cents at $ 305.00 . 
others were slightly lower . 
volume was dominated by the two front months and amounted to 829 lots , an improvement from the morning when turnover remained in single figures . 
in Paris volume stayed thin at 290 lots . 
may was down 40 cents lower at $ 305.50 and August down 80 cents at $ 304.50 .
