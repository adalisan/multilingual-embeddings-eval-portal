physical coffee trade has turned subdued on a summer lull in Europe and tight Asian and Central American supplies , and traders said activity would remain slow until August . 
they noted some U.S. and European industry demand for good quality arabica coffee but interest for nearby business was sporadic and at softer differentials . 
&quot; buyers are interested in what is not around , &quot; said one Swiss trader . 
Roasters were looking for dwindling offers from Central America for August / Sept shipment but but showed little interest for new-crop coffee , which would be available from October , in the hope that asking prices could come down further . 
&quot; They also want Ugandan but that coffee is facing a supply squeeze now , &quot; the Swiss trader said . 
for Asian coffee , the industry was seeking Sept / Oct Indonesian shipments which were hard to come by . 
nearby Indonesian supplies at the origin remained tight as shippers were willing to pay up to cover their immediate commitments . 
Indonesia &apos;s benchmark EK1 Grade 4 was traded at $ 80- $ 90 under London in the secondary market . 
&quot; For that money , you can &apos;t buy coffee at the origins , &quot; said one Dutch trader . 
&quot; Supply is so tight in Sumatra that people are trying to wash out contracts . 
there was not much excitement over the new-crop Vietnamese robusta coffee from December onwards even though Nov / Dec / Jan coffee was heard traded recently .
