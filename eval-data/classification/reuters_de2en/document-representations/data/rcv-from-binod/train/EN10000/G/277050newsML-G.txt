the head of the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) arrived in Cairo on Thursday to prepare for a weekend meeting of foreign ministers of six Gulf Arab states , Egypt and Syria . 
the representatives of the eight allies of the Damascus Declaration , formed after they united behind the U.S.-led 1991 offensive to drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait , will begin a two-day meeting in Cairo on Saturday . 
Jameel Hujilan told reporters that the meeting would cover matters of importance to all eight countries , including the Middle East peace process . 
the meeting is also expected to discuss the group &apos;s relations with Iraq and Iran . 
a Gulf official said on Wednesday the six GCC foreign ministers would hold a meeting on the sidelines of the Cairo talks to discuss a territorial dispute between Qatar and Bahrain . 
Egypt , Syria and the six members of the GCC -- Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , the United Arab Emirates , Qatar , Bahrain and Oman -- formed their Damascus Declaration alliance after the Gulf war . 
the group last met in Muscat in July . 
the Cairo consultations follow renewed Gulf Arab criticism of Iran and after Iraq &apos;s deal with the United Nations to export limited amounts of oil to pay for food and medicine . 
an annual GCC summit in Doha this month welcomed the Iraq-U.N. deal but accused Baghdad of ignoring U.N. resolutions from the 1990-91 Gulf crisis , mainly elimination of its weapons of mass destruction . 
it also called on Iran to leave three Gulf islands claimed by the UAE and criticised Tehran &apos;s military development programme and its deployment of surface-to-surface missiles .
