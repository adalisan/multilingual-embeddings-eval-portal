Boris Yeltsin &apos;s communist foes on Saturday branded the outcome of his summit meeting with Bill Clinton a &quot; capitulation &quot; for Russia but the Kremlin chief &apos;s allies said it signalled improved East-West cooperation . 
at their Helsinki summit on Friday the two presidents agreed to differ over NATO &apos;s expansion plans but vowed to press ahead with a charter defining a new relationship between Moscow and the Atlantic alliance . 
Yeltsin dropped a key Russian demand that the charter should be legally binding and promised to minimise differences over NATO expansion . 
Moscow still opposes NATO &apos;s plans to admit members from central and eastern Europe , saying they are a threat to its own security . 
&quot; The meeting was a capitulation by the current traitorous Russian regime before the United States and NATO , &quot; said the hardline communist daily Soviet Russia . 
it said the Kremlin &apos;s loud verbal offensive against NATO &apos;s plans in the run-up to the summit had been designed merely to placate Yeltsin &apos;s political opponents at home . 
the communist speaker of the State Duma ( lower house of parliament ) , Gennady Seleznyov , said NATO remained &quot; an instrument of the Cold War &quot; and decried the West &apos;s efforts to put the alliance at the centre of any new European security system . 
&quot; Plans to expand NATO to the east will inevitably lead to new lines of division in Europe and the revival of a pyschological climate of suspicion and hostility , &quot; he told Itar-Tass news agency . 
opposition to NATO expansion is one of the few issues on which most Russian politicians are able to agree and criticism was not confined to the communists and ultra-nationalists . 
former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev , architect of the political reforms that opened up his country to the West , said NATO &apos;s plans risked destroying the achievements of the post-Cold War era , TASS reported . 
the liberal Nezavisimaya daily said Russia would start forging closer ties with Asian countries like China and India , possibly leading to the creation of a new anti-Western bloc . 
Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky hinted at such a development on the eve of the Helsinki summit . 
Nevasimaya noted that Indian Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen were both due to visit Moscow next week . 
the pro-business Kommersant Daily said the outcome of the Helsinki summit was disappointing but saw some grounds for hope . 
&quot; The joint declarations ( on economic and military issues ) can be a good basis for developing cooperation , &quot; it said . 
Yeltsin and Clinton reached agreement on boosting economic ties , further cuts in nuclear weapons and steps to integrate Russia more fully into the world economy . 
Yuri Baturin , secretary of Russia &apos;s Defence Council , told Ekho Moskvy radio that Russia &apos;s interests had been fully defended at the summit . 
&quot; The Russian position was heard and conclusions were drawn from it that will point the way ahead , &quot; he said . 
regional leaders , many of them pro-Yeltsin , reacted calmly to the outcome of the summit , saying Russia needed to concentrate on more pressing domestic problems . 
&quot; I am not in raptures over the prospect of NATO expansion , though I do not see the bloc as our potential opponent , &quot; Interfax news agency quoted Alexei Lebed , head of government in Siberia &apos;s Khakasiya region . 
&quot; We should not exacerbate relations with the United States and countries joining NATO but try to smooth over contradictions and develop economic and political partnership , &quot; said Lebed , brother of former Russian security chief Alexander Lebed .
