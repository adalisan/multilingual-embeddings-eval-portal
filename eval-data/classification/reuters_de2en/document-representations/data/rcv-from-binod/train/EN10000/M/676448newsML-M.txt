rumours about possible bonus share issue ; company 
officials dismiss rumours 
blue chips at Bombay exchanges closed mixed-to-lower on Friday on a late bout of profit-taking , wiping out strong gains made in a blistering mid-session rally , traders said . 
&quot; The market was on a roller-coaster ride , &quot; said Ketan Jhaveri , chief dealer at Kotak Securities , the Indian affiliate of Goldman Sachs . 
&quot; The late correction halted the one-way run . 
huge sell-orders from local operators on the last day of the weekly end-account trade offset sharp gains . 
market outlook however remained firm , with participants terming the losses as a &quot; technical correction . 
Market-favourite reliance Industries continued its climb , with the stock closing at a new 52-week high of 360.0 , jumping 19.50 rupees or nearly six percent as foreign funds and local traders bought into the stock after a bonus meet announcement . 
the petrochemical major cheered stock markets on Thursday when it said it would consider a bonus equity share issue at its annual general meeting on June 26 . 
traders expect a bonus ratio of three shares for every five , the same as it gave 14 years ago . 
&quot; The bonus news has boosted sentiment , giving investors something to rejoice about after a long time , &quot; a dealer said 
market rumours of a bonus issue to be announced by truck maker Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Company ( TELCO ) made it a fancied stock on Friday . 
TELCO surged 30.75 rupees , or nearly seven percent , to a new 52-week high of 463.0 on bonus rumours , but ended lower at 451 rupees after the company denied the rumour . 
&quot; There &apos;s no truth in bonus issue rumours , &quot; one company official told Reuters . 
the National 100-share index closed 0.80 points down at a provisional 1,159.0 . 
the Bombay share ends the week one percent higher after rallying over eight percent in the last fortnight .
