tens of thousands of trades unionists and politicians headed for a grey , blustery Brussels on Sunday to vent their anger at high unemployment and the steady erosion of job security and social supports . 
unemployment , a seeping sore as the 15 European Union nations slash their budgets and raise taxes in the struggle to ready their economies for joining the bloc &apos;s single currency in 1999 , has become a uniting force . 
Belgium has been shaken by the shock announcement by French carmaker Renault two weeks ago that it would close its plant in Vilvoorde near Brussels with the loss of 3,100 jobs . 
the workers have occupied the factory and , together with their French colleagues who are also facing more than 2,700 job losses , have staged sporadic protests in Belgium and France . 
the closure news came on top of the bankruptcy in January of steelmaker Forges de Clabecq , threatening 1,800 jobs . 
police estimate that up to 100,000 people will attend the mass rally which is due to start at 1400 ( 1300 GMT ) with speeches by union leaders and politicians from all over Europe . 
&quot; The shock of Renault has really woken people to the problem , &quot; a union spokesman told Belgian radio on Sunday . 
unions said they expected thousands to come from France , with other delegations from Spain , Portugal , Germany , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Italy , Greece , Austria , Hungary , Slovenia and the Czech Republic . 
on Saturday Belgium &apos;s bishops added their voices to the clamour to give economic policies a more human dimension . 
&quot; The bishops of Belgium hope the march for jobs will make people think and react creatively , &quot; they said in a statement . 
&quot; There is a lack of adequate rules to make the economy more humane . 
some 500 bikers demonstrated their support at the Vilvoorde plant on Saturday , and newspapers reported that Renault show room sales in Belgium had fallen 40 percent since the news of the closure . 
police are hoping for a peaceful demonstration but are prepared for worse . 
more than 500 police and 1,000 gendarmes will be on the streets with medical teams on standby . 
unemployment in the 15-nation European Union is stuck at 10.8 percent of the workforce , with most governments apparently unable to tackle the looming social crisis . 
French Socialist Party chief Lionel Jospin will lead a delegation from national party headquarters and Communist party leader Robert Hue will take charge of his own group . 
but the issue is far wider than the bankruptcy of one company or the strategic decisions of another . 
the unions want consultations with employers on issues such as working hours , and for governments to cut the indirect tax costs of employment -- both of which were key elements in the EU &apos;s 1993 White Paper , Growth , Competitiveness and Employment . 
at the European level they want tax policies that encourage jobs rather than capital , a coherent social policy , moves to encourage economic growth instead of budget belt tightening . 
EU social affairs ministers who met in Rotterdam at the weekend said there should be a clear code of conduct for multinationals both opening and closing factories . 
but European governments have tied their own hands . 
with the decision day on who will be in the vanguard of nations joining the single currency now less than a year away , countries are tightening their belts in a bid to join the club . 
pundits say that such are the stakes that a failure to go ahead with the single currency , or even a delay , could prove fatal to the European Union itself .
