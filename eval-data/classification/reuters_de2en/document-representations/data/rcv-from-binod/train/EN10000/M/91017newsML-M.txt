world equity markets moved higher in September , continuing to rebound from the sharp correction in July that launched the quarter , Morgan Stanley Capital International said on Wednesday . 
the MSCI World Index of 22 developed market countries gained 3.8 percent during the month , compared with the 1.0 percent increase recorded in August . 
although the Europe , Australia , Far East Index advanced 2.5 percent , the index was still down 0.5 percent from the quarter as a whole . 
the Emerging Markets Free index gained 0.7 percent , finishing the quarter with a decline of 4.1 percent . 
Hong Kong , Italy , France and the U.S. were the strongest developed markets during September . 
the U.S. benefited from the low interest rates and continued signs of growth in the economy , while Hong Kong , where the currency is linked to the U.S. dollar , the Federal Reserve &apos;s decision to leave U.S interest rates unchanged improved the outlook for rates in Hong Kong . 
among the strongest performers at the third quarter were Finland , the U.K. and Sweden . 
in the U.K. , investors were attracted to equities by better than expected GDP growth , forecasts for higher corporate profits and strength in the British sterling . 
the decliners among developed market countries in September were Austria , Switzerland and New Zealand . 
Singapore , Japan and Austria on the other hand were among the 22 countries that put up a weak performance in the third quarter . 
in the emerging market countries , 14 equity markets rose while 12 declined in September . 
the strongest performers were Venezuela , Turkey and Argentina while India , the Czech Republic and Hungary were the weakest markets . 
in the quarterly assessment , Venezuela , Poland and Colombia were the strongest performers while Pakistan , India and Thailand were the weakest ones . 
as announced , the EMF index expanded to include the China Free , Hungary and Czech Republic indices . 
other changes include the addition of Taiwan to the index at a 50 percent weighting and the increase of the weighting for the Korea Index to 50 percent from 20 percent . 
the EMF returns for the quarter thus measures two months of returns from the previous EMF constituents and weighting and one month -- September -- from the new configuration .
