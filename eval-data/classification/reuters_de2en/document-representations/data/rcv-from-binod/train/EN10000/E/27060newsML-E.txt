total foreign investment in Romania in almost seven years since the country shed communist rule rose to $ 1.95 billion in mid-August , the National Statistics Board ( CNS ) said . 
a CNS report , quoting main foreign investment promoter Romanian Development Agency , said up to mid-August some $ 350 million had been pumped into the country this year , raising the total number of foreign investors to almost 52,000 from around 49,000 . 
it said Italy was the largest single investor with $ 204.5 million injected in almost seven years . 
Germany was second with $ 183.2 million , followed by South Korea with $ 159.1 million . 
the level of foreign investment in Romania remains low in comparison with other ex-communist Eastern and Central European countries . 
some local economists point to inadequate corporate laws and red tape and say foreign investors will stay away till the pace of privatisation picks up and restructuring of oversized industrial firms is well under way . 
others are more optimistic and say a mass selloff of 4,000 state enterprises will soon boost the total investment figure -- now about a fifth of that in neighbouring Hungary . 
a stock exchange , operational since last November , is also expected to help increase the foreign investment level .
