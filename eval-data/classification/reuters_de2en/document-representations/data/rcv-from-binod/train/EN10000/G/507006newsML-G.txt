Fred Goldman , the father of murder victim Ron Goldman , Monday endorsed a constitutional amendment to grant rights to crime victims and their families . 
&quot; I , like every other family member of a victim , knows what it &apos;s like to be a second class citizen in a court room , &quot; Goldman told a news conference at the Capitol that was part of National Crime Victims &apos; Rights Week . 
Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson , ex-wife of former football star O.J. 
Simpson , were murdered outside her home in Los Angeles on June 13 , 1994 . 
Simpson was charged with the murders but was found not guilty in a criminal trial in 1995 . 
but the jury in a civil suit brought by Fred Goldman and the parents of Nicole Simpson found Simpson responsible for the deaths in February and ordered him to pay $ 33 million in damages . 
Goldman and other supporters of the constitutional amendment said the Constitution provided 15 separate protections for defendents but none for victims . 
&quot; For those victims not to have equity in a court room is outrageous , &quot; he said . 
Goldman said he and his family were allowed to attend both trials but were warned by court officials not to show any emotion in the courtroom , while there were no such restrictions on Simpson or his family . 
constitutional rights for defendents include the right to a jury trial and an attorney , the right to confront witnesses and protection against self-incrimination . 
&quot; Under the Constitution defendents have all of the rights and victims have none , &quot; Sen. Jon Kyl , an Arizona Republican and one of the amendment &apos;s chief sponsors , said . 
the proposed amendment would give victims and their families the right to be told about and to be present at all court proceedings on their case , the right to be heard about the sentence , plea bargin or release of the defendent and the right to be told about an offender &apos;s release or escape . 
&quot; We are saying the victim should have these basic rights , &quot; Sen. Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat , said . 
she said in many states crime victims were not notified about key court proceedings in their cases . 
Marc Klaas , whose 11-year old daughter Polly was murdered , also endorsed the amendment , saying his court experience at the murder trial was &quot; absolutely agonizing . 
the amendment was introduced last year but never came to a vote in either the House or Senate . 
Feinstein and Kyl said they were seeking co-sponsors and hoped for action soon on the measure , which President Clinton backs . 
it needs a two-thirds majority in both chambers to be sent to the states for ratification . 
a hearing on the amendment is scheduled Wednesday in the Senate Judicary Committee . 
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde , R-Illinois , who also supports the measure , said he hoped to hold hearings in June .
