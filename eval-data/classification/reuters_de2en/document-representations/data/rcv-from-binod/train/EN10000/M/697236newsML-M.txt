Dutch shares closed one percent lower on Monday , backing away from an all-time high early in the session , after a batch of U.S. economic figures spooked Wall Street ahead of Fed policy meetings this week . 
&quot; The U.S. home sales and Chicago Purchasing Managers &apos; index showed stronger than expected U.S. economic activity and that &apos;s got people worried ahead of the FOMC meetings , &quot; a dealer said . 
wall Street dropped more than 70 points after figures , dragging the AEX down 8.90 points to close at 861.55 . 
the Dutch blue chip index had earlier touched a record 876.23 , beating the June 26 high of 875.61 , buoyed by a strong dollar . 
figures from the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago showed a strong 4.7 point rise in economic growth for June pointing to sharply higher production and strong new orders . 
a 7.1 percent rise in U.S. May home sales was also read as a sign of stronger than expected economic activity . 
&quot; It &apos;s come quite close to the FOMC meeting and it &apos;s just got people nervous , &quot; another dealer said . 
the two-day meeting could deliver a steer on the U.S. interest rate outlook , although analysts believe the FOMC is unlikely to signal a rise in U.S. rates . 
dealers said they anticipated a quiet Tuesday session ahead of the meetings . 
&quot; A lot of it could depend on what happens on Wall Street tonight . 
you never know , we could come in tomorrow and it &apos;s all seen as overdone and the Dow is up 50 points or it could be down 100 , we &apos;ll have to wait and see , &quot; said a dealer . 
technical analysts are fairly sanguine that the AEX rally , which has powered the index up nearly 35 percent so far in 1997 , can continue and that 900-910 is achievable near-term . 
&quot; As long as everybody is still hoping for the correction to buy there won &apos;t be one , &quot; it added , advising buying on weakness with a target of 910 on the AEX .
