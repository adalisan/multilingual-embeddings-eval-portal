the key December three-month Euroyen futures ended slightly lower on Friday , as the futures received support from the Bank of Japan &apos;s surprisingly accommodative money market operation . 
&quot; Euroyen futures began the day lower in line with falls in overseas markets , but recovered later due to a rise in Japanese government bonds and most importantly , the BOJ &apos;s accommodative money market operation , &quot; a city bank trader said . 
the BOJ injected a net 200 billion yen into the money market this morning , against a fund shortfall of 100 billion yen . 
the key overnight call rate fell to around 0.47 percent after the BOJ &apos;s operation , compared to a weighted average of 0.53 percent on Thursday . 
traders said the weighted average was likely to be 0.47 percent on Friday . 
the BOJ conducted an accommodative money market operation on Friday morning that was aimed at helping to lower the key overnight call rate , a BOJ official told Reuters . 
the BOJ official also said that the accommodative operation was within the commitments the bank announced in September 1995 . 
when the BOJ last cut its discount rate to 0.50 percent from one percent on September 8 , 1995 , the bank said it expected the key overnight call rate to move slightly below the discount rate on average , as it would make efforts to supply sufficient funds to the money market . 
traders said the BOJ would probably conduct a neutral money market operation on Monday .
