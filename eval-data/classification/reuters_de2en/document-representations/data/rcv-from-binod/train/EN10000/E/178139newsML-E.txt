France &apos;s opposition Socialist party plans to imitate the U.S. &quot; New Deal &quot; of the 1930s to revive France &apos;s flagging economy , party leader Lionel Jospin said on Saturday . 
at a meeting of the party &apos;s national council to define policies ahead of the next parliametary elections in 1998 , Jospin said Prime Minister Alain Juppe &apos;s centre-right coalition had failed and was collapsing because of internal dissent . 
&quot; We plan to break , like the New Deal did in its time , with the blindness and sterility of conservative policies which dominate the Western world and are threatening the European social model , &quot; Jospin said in a speech . 
U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt launched the New Deal in 1933 to help lift the United States out of the Depression in a plan that included massive spending on public works , loans to farmers and higher agriculture prices . 
a 15-page Socialist draft policy document foresees creation of 700,000 jobs for young people in two years and a law cutting the working week to 35 hours from 39 with no loss in wages . 
it also focuses on building housing and renewing decaying cities . 
Party spokesman Francois Hollande said the plans , due to be passed to grassroots members once approved by party leaders , would not upset fiscal rigour in France . 
&quot; We do not foresee any rise in the overall tax burden , &quot; he said . 
Jospin , whose party was routed at the last elections in 1993 amid rising unemployment and sleaze , savaged Juppe and President Jacques Chirac , who said this week he had no plans to change economic course and praised Juppe as lucid and courageous . 
&quot; Everything the government touches creates disorder or disputes . 
one has the impression of a power that is literally decomposing , &quot; Jospin said . 
Juppe &apos;s popularity has slumped as unemployment has hit record highs . 
the premier faces growing criticism from his fractious coalition over his drive to cut the state deficit in order to help France qualify for a planned European Union single currency by 1999 . 
the Socialists also favour the single currency .
