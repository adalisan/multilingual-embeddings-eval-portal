NYCE frozen concentrated orange juice ended firmer with the large 13-cent November premium over most-active January still intact as the market kept a close watch over the spot contract whose last trading day is on Friday . 
earlier some traders voiced concern about the high open interest in the spot November contract , but NYCE officials tried soothing some of the fears . 
November went out 0.30 cent firmer at 112.25 cents per pound . 
January settled 0.60 cent higher at 99.35 cents , traded 99.70 to 98.90 cents . 
volume was estimated at 1,750 lots compared to Wednesday &apos;s official 976 lots . 
traders said activity was thin because many players kept to the sidelines to watch how November &apos;s expiry resolved itself . 
analysts said the strong spot month helped pull up the forward months even though prices then were expected to be lower because of more availability of juice .
