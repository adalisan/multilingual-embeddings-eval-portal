the International amateur Athletic Federation ( IAAF ) on Tuesday withdrew its appeal against a civil court ruling in favour of German sprinter Katrin Krabbe , clearing the way for her to sue for damages over a doping ban . 
a Munich civil court ruled last March that the 1991 double world champion could sue the IAAF over a suspension in 1993 which proved to be illegal under German law . 
the retraction of the IAAF &apos;s appeal means that decision finally becomes legal . 
but the IAAF said they were not worried about the prospect of Krabbe pressing for damages . 
&quot; We are not afraid of a demand for damages from the former world sprint champion , &quot; said Istvan Gyulai , IAAF general secretary . 
legal experts say it is unlikely Krabbe would get anywhere near the one million marks she wants because most of her contracts had been terminated before the IAAF ban . 
Gyulai said the IAAF was so sure Krabbe could not win heavy damages that it had ruled out the prospect of an out-of-court settlement . 
&quot; All the experts we have spoken to said Katrin Krabbe could never prove her demand for damages . 
her reputation had already changed after the German athletics federation ( DLV ) ban , &quot; he said . 
Krabbe admitted taking the banned drug clenbuterol in 1992 , but the DLV and the IAAF were unable to impose the mandatory four-year ban because of a technical problem with the German federation &apos;s rulebook . 
Krabbe , who has married a lawyer and had a child since she was forced off the track , is not expected to run again . 
Gyulai said the federation was working on new rules .
