Japan &apos;s overall trade surplus fell sharply last month but the gap with the United States widened by more than 80 percent , the government said Wednesday in a report signalling a major shift in the trading pattern due to the weaker yen . 
the January trade figures , released by the Finance Ministry , also pointed to the possibility of renewed friction with the United States if the imbalance keeps growing . 
Japan &apos;s customs-cleared trade surplus fell a hefty 91.7 percent from a year earlier to 5.19 billion yen ( $ 41.8 million ) , declining for the 26th month in a row . 
but the Finance Ministry said the fall was exaggerated by seasonal factors . 
January trade figures are notoriously unpredictable because the length of the New Year holiday , including weekends , varies from year to year , affecting the number of business days . 
while the overall surplus plunged , the surplus with the United States rocketed 81.6 percent in January from a year earlier to 298.34 billion yen ( $ 2.40 billion ) . 
however , an almost correspondingly large trade deficit with China offset the huge surplus with the United States in the overall figures . 
economists said the recent fall in the yen was boosting Japanese exports , particularly to the United States , and held out the possibility of a flare-up in trade friction with Washington if the weak yen keeps squeezing U.S. exporters . 
&quot; Maybe more toward the end of the year you can see signs of that ( renewed friction ) but it &apos;s too early , &quot; said Peter Morgan , chief economist at James Capel Pacific . 
in January , overall exports to the United States jumped 27 percent to 1.06 trillion yen ( $ 8.5 billion ) yen , with shipments of cars soaring 78 percent . 
&quot; The bilateral surplus is the one that has responded most dramatically to exchange rates in the past , &quot; Morgan said . 
the weaker yen has made Japanese products more competitive overseas , while boosting the price of imports into Japan . 
after hitting a record high of 79.75 to the dollar in April 1995 , the yen has steadily trodden a downward path . 
the dollar was hovering around 124 yen in Tokyo on Wednesday . 
economists said the pace of decline in the seasonally unadjusted trade surplus has been slowing , and they expect the surplus to show a year-on-year increase in the months to come . 
some economic research institutions had expected the January surplus to more than double to about 150 billion yen ( $ 1.20 billion ) from 62.92 billion yen ( $ 507 million ) last year -- highlighting the transitional nature of the trade pattern . 
although the overall surplus continued to decline , seasonally adjusted figures showed an opposite trend , with the surplus growing more than 25 percent in January from December to 643.36 billion yen ( $ 5.18 billion ) . 
export volumes rose 12.6 percent in January , while import volumes increased 7.5 percent . 
&quot; We have seen the seasonally adjusted surplus pick up , and I think this will definitely continue this year , &quot; said Jason James , strategist at James Capel Pacific . 
the Finance Ministry official said the drop in the unadjusted January figure was due to sluggish productivity over the New Year . 
there is no change in the general trend of the surplus continuing to decline , &quot; the official said . 
but the official declined to comment on whether there was any change in the trade pattern with the United States .
