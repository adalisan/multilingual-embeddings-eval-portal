European bunker prices were mixed on Wednesday as Rotterdam again recovered from a weak start , dealers said . 
removing delivery costs , the bunker market was cheaper than the normally underlying barge market which again recovered after morning weakness . 
&quot; The sellers are still rather keen to shift product which has left bunkers below barges &quot; one supplier said . 
Hamburg prices strengthened as a number of sellers decided to hold off for possibly higher prices in February . 
Mediterranean prices were mixed , most of them readjusting in line with recent fluctuations at larger ports . 
Saudi Aramco slashed its fuel oil and gas oil bunker prices after two weeks of weakness on international markets . 
red Sea A-960 fuel oil fell by $ 19 to $ 105 a tonne and in the Gulf by $ 15 to $ 105 .
