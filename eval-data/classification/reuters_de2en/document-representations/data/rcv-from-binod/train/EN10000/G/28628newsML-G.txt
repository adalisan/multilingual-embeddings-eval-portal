pop singer Michael Jackson came to Prague on Tuesday to launch his first tour in two years as promoters erected a huge statue of the star on a hill over the city where a monument to Soviet boss Josef Stalin once stood . 
Jackson &apos;s three-month &quot; history &quot; tour through Europe , Africa and Asia kicks off on Saturday with a concert on Prague &apos;s Letna Plain where 130,000 are expected , but he arrived four days early to do some sightseeing in and around the Czech capital . 
after his jet sat for half an hour on the tarmac of Prague airport &apos;s VIP terminal , the flamboyant but reclusive Jackson emerged in a gold lame and red outfit under a white parasol blocking the bright sun . 
several hundred fans handpicked by promoters greeted the star , and he hugged several fans who presented gifts on the tarmac before Jackson &apos;s motorcade left . 
after waving at others lining the 15 km ( 10 mile ) route into the city from a gleaming Rolls Royce , Jackson and his police-escorted phalynx of luxury cars carrying his entourage drove through a screaming hotel welcoming party . 
thousands of fans amassed at the hotel on the river Vltava ( Moldau ) , climbing over each other for a glimpse of the star on his first tour since he was cleared of child molestation charges by a U.S. court because of lack of evidence . 
Pavel Klika , in his late teens from the southern Czech city of Tabor , played a human &quot; K &quot; in a seven-member group spelling out J-A-C-K-S-O-N for his arrival . 
&quot; I had to come here to see him to really beleive he was in the Czech Republic , even though I have a ticket to see him on Saturday -- I just couldn &apos;t wait , &quot; Klika said . 
the singer &apos;s penthouse suite Prague faces the hill where a 10-metre ( 33 foot ) water-filled statue of Jackson takes up the rock pedastal where Communists built a massive monument to Stalin which they later blew up up after his death in 1953 . 
despite complaints about the Jackson statue in some quarters , Prague City Hall finally approved its placement until the concert is completed on Saturday . 
two huge torches on either side of Jackson &apos;s statue were lit recalling the days when Stalin &apos;s Cult of personality kept two Olympic-style flames burning . 
the Prague stop , Jackson &apos;s first visit to the Czech capital in a long series of rock concerts since the fall of Communism here in 1989 , has so far avoided the controversy at other planned dates on his tour . 
in South Korea , civic and religious groups reacted bitterly to a decision to let Jackson play two concerts in Seoul in October , saying it was unbelievable that the government agreed to to make an &quot; amoral singer &quot; the teenagers &apos; idol . 
a planned stop in Casablanca was cancelled by Moroccan authorities , without explanation . 
a concert organiser said the government did not want 100,000 youths all in the same place .
