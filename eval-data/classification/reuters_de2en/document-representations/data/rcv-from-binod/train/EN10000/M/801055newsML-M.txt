Yen-based Tokyo precious metals futures except silver ended lower on Thursday , pressured by a firming of the yen against the dollar earlier in the day and lower spot prices after lacklustre trade due to Japan &apos;s Obon holidays , traders said . 
traders said Russia was selling some palladium in the spot market , contributing to a fall in platinum group metals ( PGMs ) . 
palladium futures ranged from 15 yen to 39 yen per gram lower , with benchmark June ending down 20 at 678 yen . 
platinum prices ranged from 20 yen to 36 yen per gram lower . 
benchmark June platinum was off 24 yen at 1,488 yen . 
&quot; I heard that Russia was offering relatively large amounts of palladium to sell in the spot Zurich market , which dented spot palladium prices , &quot; a trader at a trading house said . 
in PGM futures , trade-house selling pushed down prices although early losses were curbed by late short-covering . 
the traders said platinum group metals ( PGMs ) have been in a phase of a correction but added that they expect further price falls to be limited . 
good palladium demand and steady platinum demand in Japan mean the current tightness in the physical market is unlikely to ease in the near-term , they said . 
in gold futures , activity was mainly dominated by inter-month trade by trade houses with trade moving in line with the currency market , the traders said . 
gold futures ranged from seven yen to 10 yen per gram lower , with most-active benchmark June ending up 10 yen at 1,205 yen . 
spot gold was quoted at $ 327.00 / 50 per ounce at 0805 GMT , against $ 326.90 / 327.40 in New York on Wednesday . 
in the local bullion market , spot gold premiums remained low at around 30 U.S. cents per ounce over the world benchmark amid lacklustre gold demand in Japan .
