Argentine stocks closed higher Tuesday , cheered by the two-day rebound on Wall Street and the U.S. Federal Reserve &apos;s decision to keep rates steady . 
&quot; The market here is doing well , although it &apos;s still undermined by the volatility we saw even today on Wall Street , &quot; said Gabriel Ruiz at brokers Tavelli . 
the blue-chip MerVal index .MERV jumped 1.3 percent to 850.01 , recouping most of the losses incurred last week . 
&quot; If things calm down abroad the Bolsa might finally embark on a steady upward course , because local fundamentals remain very solid , &quot; Tavelli said . 
he also said the Argentine Bolsa had an edge over other emerging markets . 
&quot; It &apos;s lagging the main Latin American bourses as far as this year &apos;s gains are concerned , and of course there &apos;s turbulence in Asia , &quot; he said . 
traders noted even though the Bolsa got off to a late start ahead of the Fed &apos;s announcement on rates , floor volume remained healthy at 33.3 million pesos against 34.8 million Friday ( Monday was a holiday ) . 
over-the-counter turnover surged to 155.1 million pesos from 48.3 million Friday . 
&quot; Institutional investors are pretty active here and keeping the undertone firm , &quot; another dealer said . 
the broad market index inched up 0.2 percent , with winners outpacing losers 25 to 17 and 27 issues closing unchanged . 
top blue-chip gainers were steelmakers Siderca and Siderar , which rallied 4.6 percent and 3.8 percent , respectively , carmaker Sevel , up 4.5 percent , and textile and footwear firm Alpargatas , up 3.1 percent . 
MerVal losers were led by foods giant Molinos , cement stock Polledo and oil company Astra , off 3.4 percent , 2.4 percent and 2.2 percent , respectively .
