NYCE cotton futures settled lower weighed down by weather-related trade selling which touched off some sell stops , floor traders said . 
volume was heavy about 15,000 lots changed hands . 
the decline was sparked by news of beneficial rains falling over west Texas during the past 24 hours . 
rains fell across the west Texas cotton growing region which encompasses about three million acres , Texas A and M cotton specialist Carl Anderson said . 
&quot; They were very beneficial for the region especially on the dryland , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Lamesa , Texas , a major cotton growing area , had 1.34 inches of rain during the last 24 hours , &quot; weather Services Corp meteorologist Mike Palmerino said . 
the Delta was also expected to receive beneficial rain in the next 48 hours with moderate temperatures , &quot; he said . 
but Anderson said the market did not have much direction . 
&quot; It has been following a narrow channel between 74.50 and 75.50 cents , basis December , &quot; he said . 
trade selling led prices downward . 
&quot; We touched some sell stops at 74.70 cents , basis December and all the way down , &quot; a floor source said . 
most active December lost 1.00 cent at 74.40 cents a lb .
