Mexico &apos;s overnight Cetes rate closed up 50 basis points at 28.0 percent on Monday due to liquidity pressures and a lukewarm response from the peso to the new ACE economic pact , traders said . 
&quot; Rates did not fall as expected and , on the contrary , they wavered a lot , &quot; said one trader , referring to the expected outcome of the ACE . 
the Alliance for Economic Growth ( ACE ) , signed on Saturday , is the latest in a series of economic packages agreed between government , business and Labor leaders . 
among other things , the ACE provided for the minimum wage to rise by 17 percent in December , and for electricity and energy costs to increase by up to 22 percent . 
&quot; Also , liquidity was tight because of the forthcoming cut-off date for checking accounts ( held by banks with the central bank ) , &quot; the trader added . 
banks have to settle balances outstanding on checking accounts they hold with the central bank on Wednesday . 
other traders said that overnight rates , which had opened down , began to rise once more as the peso did not make a hoped-for substantial recovery . 
&quot; The peso was expected to recover by more than it actually did once the ACE was signed , so overnight rates stayed up , &quot; a trader said . 
the benchmark 48-hour peso closed 2.1 centavos firmer at 7.8975 / 7.9040 per dollar . 
overnight rates on bank paper meanwhile closed 15 basis points down at 29.95 percent . 
analysts and traders generally expected Banco de Mexico to assign the bellwether 28-day Cetes rate at Tuesday &apos;s auction some 50 basis points above last week &apos;s rate . 
total credit maturities for Tuesday were estimated at 6.398 billion pesos .
