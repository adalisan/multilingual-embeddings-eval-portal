oil prices recovered on Tuesday after the market shook off earlier jitters that followed remarks from an Iraqi oil official suggesting crude oil exports could resume next week . 
world benchmark crude oil Brent Blend for January delivery ended 13 higher at $ 23.75 a barrel . 
prices dipped earlier on news that Iraqi state-owned oil company SOMO had already signed contracts with some foreign companies to sell oil under the delayed partial oil sales agreement . 
Iraqi oil exports have been banned under a U.N. embargo imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 . 
but the last hurdle blocking a U.N. &quot; oil-for-food &quot; deal worth $ 2 billion over six months was cleared last week . 
OPEC Secretary-General Rilwanu Lukman said he was confident the oil market would absorb Iraqi crude and forecast there would be little impact on prices . 
&quot; The market is always nervous , &quot; Lukman told reporters in Vienna . 
&quot; It looks as though the market has largely discounted any impact from the re-introduction of Iraqi oil ... We are only talking about another 700,000 or so barrels per day , &quot; he said . 
an Iraqi oil official said on Tuesday the first Iraqi oil since the Gulf War could be shipped to world markets next week . 
&quot; No problem remains ... The story is over ... Loading is supposed to start next week , &quot; Taha Hmud Mosa , senior under-secretary at Iraq &apos;s oil ministry , told Reuters . 
Mosa said Iraq had signed &quot; initial contracts &quot; with 50 international firms for the oil sales , putting Iraqi crude on to world markets for the first time since the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi troops . 
&quot; We have deals with 50 firms from Europe , South East Asia and South America ... These are initial but binding international contracts . 
they do not include prices as prices have to be determined at the time of shipping , &quot; he said . 
Mosa said the deals could be completed &quot; in several days as the companies are ready waiting for the signal to start loading . 
on Monday the United nations said an inspection of oil metering equipment by Dutch firm Saybolt was the last step before the U.N. plan could start running . 
two experts from the firm arrived in Baghdad on Tuesday . 
meanwhile , traders of refined oil products said there was good demand in the West for winter heating fuels . 
stocks are at low levels and oil companies are scrambling to refill near empty storage tanks . 
&quot; The problem of working with low stocks is beginning to have an effect . 
buyers are having to pay big numbers when they need the oil , &quot; said one trader .
