third seed Michael Chang beat second seed Thomas muster of Austria 6-1 7-6 ( 7-1 ) Saturday to earn the chance to defend his Champions Cup title , against surprise finalist Bohdan Ulihrach . 
the unseeded and 43rd-ranked Czech posted a 6-3 6-2 victory over unseeded and 35th-ranked Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden . 
by virtue of his semifinal success Ulihrach should move into the top 30 in the rankings . 
Ulihrach has had a dream week . 
he ended Pete Sampras &apos;s 20-0 match winning streak in the second round here . 
but instead of being overwhelmed by his second career victory over the top-ranked Sampras , Ulihrach &apos;s continued his winning ways . 
&quot; You cannot look past his results this week , &quot; Chang said of Ulihrach , whom he has never played . 
&quot; Although Bohdan is not a top 10 guy at this particular time , he &apos;s had great results . 
muster and Chang came into the match with identical win-loss records this year of 15-2 . 
each had won one title in four tournaments played this year . 
each has won one Grand Slam , the French Open . 
prior to Saturday &apos;s match , muster had won five of their six encounters . 
but the normally tenacious muster had problems getting around the court , which put him at the mercy of Chang . 
&quot; That &apos;s because of bad footwork . 
&quot; I think a lot of times when you get into the long points or the grinding points , sometimes he was able to kind of wear me down a little bit . 
hopefully , each time I go out and play Thomas from here on out , I &apos;ll go out there with confidence and remember he &apos;s human . 
Chang whipped muster in the first set , taking service breaks in the fourth and sixth games . 
in the second set , muster seemed to be bouncing back to his old pugnacious self , but couldn &apos;t keep the momentum going for long . 
muster was unable to take the opportunity to go ahead 5-3 in the second set on two break points in that eighth game . 
the tiebreaker was all Chang &apos;s as muster sprayed unforced errors into the net or out of the court . 
the only point he won was the second when Chang double faulted . 
Ulihrach kept Bjorkman pinned to the baseline , preventing the Swede from playing his preferred serve-and-volley game . 
Bjorkman , who won their only previous encounter , made only three winners on his serve and one with a volley . 
&quot; I think he was not playing so well , &quot; Ulihrach said of Bjorkman . 
&quot; Maybe he was a little bit tired because he played last week and got to the semifinal .
