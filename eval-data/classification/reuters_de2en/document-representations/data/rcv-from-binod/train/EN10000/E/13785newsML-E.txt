the coming week is likely to be crucial in determining whether or not Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals bows to market pressures and hikes South Africa &apos;s Bank rate . 
market players will be looking to the governor for indications of what his next move will be when he addresses the central bank &apos;s annual general meeting in Pretoria on Tuesday . 
despite an apparent shift to more positive market sentiment on Friday , economists said the Bank remained under pressure to hike its key lending rate -- currently at 16 percent . 
&quot; Conditions at the moment are extremely poor , &quot; said Nico Czypionka , group economist at Standard Bank , citing the continuing liquidity squeeze on the money market where the daily shortage has held above eight billion rand since August 2 . 
&quot; If it is not quite as high as it would have been it is because the Reserve Bank has been ... putting liquidity into the market which is not something one can do on a sustainable basis , &quot; Czypionka said . 
some have suggested the shortage could have risen to as much as 14.5 billion rand by month-end , had it not been for Reserve Bank intervention . 
there have also been suggestions that the Bank has been manipulating the weekly Treasury Bill tender in a bid to relieve some of the pressure for a rate hike . 
on Friday , the Bank cut its offer at the weekly three-month Treasury Bill auction to 600 million rand from the customary 900 million rand . 
by reducing the offer , the Bank attracted more aggressive bids at higher prices , which translated to a lower discount rate . 
the rate fell to 16.09 percent from 16.19 the week before . 
high short-term interest rates continue to keep a tight grip on banks &apos; margins , although a unilateral prime rate hike without a lead from the Reserve Bank is unlikely given the political fallout banks faced when they moved on their own on May 17 . 
with hindsight , economists now believe that the reversal of that hike on June 25 was premature given the rand &apos;s near five percent slide slide against the dollar since then . 
&quot; The only thing that makes it less premature is the fact that the Reserve Bank reduced the second tier penal rate which eased some of the pressure , &quot; Dennis dykes , chief economist at Nedcor Group , said . 
the Bank cut its rate on second tier assets to 0.75 percentage points above Bank rate from 1.50 percent on June 25 . 
Czypionka still believes that , in the face of overwhelming market pressure , a Bank rate hike on its own would not be sufficient to swing the pervading negative sentiment . 
&quot; What we need is an interest rate increase and a package -- something concrete , &quot; he said . 
he said such a package should include an announcement on government sales of its holdings in companies such as Sasol and Iscor , further clarity on its deficit reduction programme and a harsh clampdown on crime -- the latter having been cited last week as a major deterrent to foreign investment in South Africa . 
a key test for Stals this week will be July money supply data , due from Wednesday . 
an increase in growth from last month would put more pressure on him to hike rates , economists said . 
a Reuters consensus poll of economists forecast money supply growth would rise 16.2 percent in July from 15.56 percent in June , while private sector credit demand was expected to come in at 18.4 percent from 18.6 percent . 
the conversion of government &apos;s R146 stock to a liquid asset as well as coupon payments on the R150 and R153 stocks should aid liquidity towards the month-end . 
but dykes added that the general feeling in the market was that if there had been no signs of an improvement in market conditions by end-August , pressure on Stals to hike would grow . 
Cees Bruggemans , group economist at First National Bank , said Stals was walking a tightrope given the cost of raising rates to the economy . 
&quot; If you get it wrong , it implies huge economic political liabilities . 
on the other hand not raising rates if in fact the conditions warrant it similarly has big penalties .
