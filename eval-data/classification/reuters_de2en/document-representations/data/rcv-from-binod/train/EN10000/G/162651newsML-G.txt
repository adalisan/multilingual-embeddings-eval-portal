a leading U.S. medical organisation on Monday released guidelines for the treatment of impotence , a condition that affects 10 to 20 million men in the United States alone . 
the American Urological Association &apos;s guidelines said vacuum constriction devices , drug injection therapy and penile prosthesis implants were safe and effective treatment options for impotence caused by physiological factors . 
the guidelines -- released at the World Meeting on impotence , an international research meeting in San Francisco -- were drawn up by a panel of experts who analysed results of treatments published in scientific literature . 
&quot; The three therapies recommended in these guidelines are all effective treatment options , each with specific advantages and disadvantages , which patients must be informed about and weigh before making a treatment decision , &quot; panel chairman Drogo Montague of the Cleveland Clinic said . 
the guidelines said venous and arterial surgery for impotent men with arteriosclerotic disease should be viewed as investigational therapies only , and their use limited to a research setting where long-term follow-up care was available . 
the natural plant substance yohimbine , frequently prescribed for impotence , did not appear to be an effective treatment , the guidelines said . 
the panel called for research to develop new , simple-to-use treatments for impotence with minimal side effects . 
&quot; The panel feels that such therapies probably will be oral or topical medications , &quot; said panel member James Barada of Albany , New York . 
the vacuum constriction device causes penile rigidity by means of a vacuum , then traps the blood in the penis with an elastic band or ring placed around the base of the penis . 
the panel said the devices were reliable and safe with no serious side effects when prescription devices were used properly . 
in penile injection therapy , vasoactive drugs are injected into the erection chambers of the penis , permitting an increase in blood flow . 
the panel said that with practice the injection procedure was easy and usually painless , although some men had discomfort following injection . 
the most serious complication was prolonged erection , it said . 
another was the possibility of scar tissue forming in the penis . 
a penile prosthesis is a plastic device surgically implanted inside the penis so that it can be made rigid . 
with a penile prosthesis , a patient can create an erection whenever he wants . 
once it is implanted , however , it is difficult for a patient to change his mind and choose a different treatment option , the panel said . 
the prostheses sometimes fail , requiring additional surgery , it said .
