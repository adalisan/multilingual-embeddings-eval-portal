Turkey &apos;s secularist military gave evidence on Thursday in support of a court case to close the Islam-based Welfare Party , the biggest party in parliament . 
Anatolian news agency said prosecutors had accepted as evidence military documents on the party of former prime minister Necmettin Erbakan and passed them on to the Constitutional Court . 
chief state prosecutor Vural Savas in May opened a case to close the Islamist party on the grounds that it was threatening Turkey &apos;s secular constitution . 
legal sources say the case is expected to last about six months . 
Erbakan , the country &apos;s first Islamist leader , earlier this year alarmed Turkey &apos;s establishment with a series of mainly symbolic challenges to its secular traditions . 
the clash between Welfare and the staunchly secular military led to Erbakan &apos;s resignation as prime minister last month . 
his government has been replaced by an anti-Islamist coalition led by conservative Mesut Yilmaz , which faces a vote of confidence on July 12 .
