thin domestic buying interest from Australia is keeping light Australian crudes under pressure . 
June supplies , which normally should have been committed by early May , are being offered still on the spot market . 
a cargo of end June North West shelf condensate is offered by an Australian refiner , with a partial cargo of Thevenard Island crude and an early June loading Kutubu also on offer . 
the recent low prices of heavy Asian crudes have prompted Australian refiners to run a heavier crude slate in the last two months , increasing their purchases of Minas and Bach Ho at the expense of lighter Asian grades . 
the bulk of June Bach Ho traded a fortnight ago is said to have gone into Australia . 
an Australian producer sold its end May cargo of North West shelf last week . 
details could not be confirmed , but was heard to have gone to a trader , heading for the U.S .. 
the same trader had been looking at Arun APPI + 0.50 for its end June North West shelf cargo , which was finally committed to a term buyer . 
a producer surprised the market , selling a first-half July Tapis cargo this week . 
the buyer and price was not revealed . 
buyers were not expected to emerge until later . 
the producer still has a June Tapis cargo available at Tapis APPI + 0.40 , in line with the last Tapis trade done , despite most traders &apos; assessment that the realistic market for Tapis is lower .
