the United States acknowledged on Tuesday it recently completed a study of Israeli settlement activity but refused to confirm a published report that the study found more than a quarter of settler homes were empty . 
&quot; I can &apos;t speak specifically about this report because it has not been made public but we have from time to time and just recently tried to establish a basis of information for ourselves and for the Congress on this issue and we &apos;ve done that , &quot; State Department Nicholas Burns told reporters . 
Israel &apos;s Haaretz daily said Washington , citing U.S. data showing a large number of homes lying vacant , believed any expansion of Jewish settlements was unnecessary . 
the report has caused controversy in Israel where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed it as groundless . 
at a news briefing , Burns confirmed that legislation under which the United States provided Israel with housing loan guarantees imposed a responsibility on Washington to monitor settlement activity , including such factors as construction and occupancy . 
burns said he did not believe the issue came up in U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross &apos; talks in the Middle East last week . 
later , a senior U.S. official who refused to speak on the record said : &quot; I &apos;m not sure about the full accuracy of this particular report in the Israeli press .
