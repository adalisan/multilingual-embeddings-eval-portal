China has succeeded in cloning a gene of the giant Panda , a breakthrough that could help to prevent some diseases among the endangered species , scientists said on Tuesday . 
scientists had successfully copied a Panda gene linked to nervous disorders , said a researcher at the Chengdu zoo in southwestern Sichuan province that cloned the gene in research with the biology department of the Sichuan United University . 
&quot; This is important ... this gene cloning technique marks a new level in research on pandas , &quot; the zoo researcher said . 
&quot; It also marks preparation for further study on cell cloning of pandas , which still seems remote at present , &quot; he said . 
the gene that had been cloned was known as BDNF , or Brain derived Neurotrophic Factor , he said . 
&quot; This is the first time in the world that anyone has successfully used this type of copying technique on pandas , &quot; the researcher said , while stressing that it was still far too early to clone the endangered animal . 
however , the achievement marked an important step toward saving the Panda , since diseases of the nervous system were a major cause of death among pandas , he said . 
epilepsy had killed about 10 pandas since the 1980s and the new technique could help to diagnose and cure such nervous system diseases , he said . 
&quot; This achievement sets a good foundation for the prevention of nervous system diseases among pandas and demonstrates that our country &apos;s Panda research has broken new ground in biology , &quot; the Xinhua news agency said . 
only about 1,000 giant pandas survive in their rugged China habitat and their low sex drive and poor reproductive ability are major factors in their march toward extinction , experts say .
