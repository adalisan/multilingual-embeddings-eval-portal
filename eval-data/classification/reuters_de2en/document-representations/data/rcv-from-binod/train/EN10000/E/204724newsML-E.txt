the Westpac-Melbourne leading index of economic activity , which indicates where activity will be in six to nine months time , fell 0.4 point or 0.3 percent in September , Westpac said on Wednesday . 
the coincident index , which provides a broad measure of current activity , fell by 3.9 points or 2.2 percent , while the leading Index of Inflation fell 0.1 of a percentage point to 4.5 percent . 
the six month smoothed annual growth rate fell 1.6 percent from 2.4 percent in August and has been stuck in a range of zero to 2.5 percent since the beginning of 1996 , Westpac said . 
&quot; While the Index stays in that range , it foreshadows economic activity will remain below the long-term trend ( 2.7 percent ) for the next six to nine months , &quot; said Bill Evans , Westpac &apos;s General Manager , Economics . 
&quot; This suggests the badly needed pick-up in economic activity cannot be expected before the second half of 1997 , &quot; he said . 
he also said that the sharp fall in the Coincident Index was of particular concern . 
this fall had been clearly signalled by the weakness in the leading Index in 1995 and 1996 , but the trend fall in the smoothed annual rate growth rate for the Index , indicates economic conditions are not improving . 
Westpac &apos;s view is the weakness in activity is the key concern for policy-makers given the risks of inflation have diminished substanially . 
&quot; The leading Index of Inflation fell again in September and continues to suggest further alleviation of inflationary pressures , &quot; Evans said . 
&quot; Combined with a stagnant leading index of activity and weakening coincident index , another cut in interest rates should be a high priority , &quot; he added .
