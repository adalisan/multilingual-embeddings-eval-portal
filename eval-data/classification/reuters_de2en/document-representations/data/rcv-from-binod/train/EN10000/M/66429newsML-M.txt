&quot; It &apos;s very orderly , &quot; Marty Kearney at PTI Securities in Chicago , said of the expiration of stock index options . 
&quot; It &apos;s kind of quiet . 
individual equity options and stock index futures also expire on Friday . 
Jay Shartsis , head of options trading at R.F. 
Lafferty &amp; Co in New York , said given the quiet trading , the OEX may close between the 660 and 665 strike prices . 
&quot; It &apos;s docile , &quot; Shartsis said . 
he added that a burst of volume at the opening , which was expiration-related , could be the highlight of the session . 
&quot; It &apos;s going to be a quiet closer , &quot; he said . 
the options expire at the close on Friday and settle on Saturday morning . 
on the OEX , the September options continued to be the most active , with the September 660 put trading more than 15,700 contracts and the 660 and 665 calls trading about 12,500 each .

the October 655 call traded more than 8,700 contracts , the 660 put traded 3,000 contracts and the 650 put traded 2,500 . 
the preliminary settlement price for September S &amp; Ps was seen at 684.70 , but that price could change as the settlement continues .
