around 75 Turks and Kurds were detained in the German city of Cologne on Thursday night to prevent a pitched battle between rival supporters of a Turkish and a Kurdish soccer team , police said on Friday . 
police said the two groups were armed with knives and baseball bats and had been hurling insults at each other and squaring up for a brawl after a local league match . 
most of the men were released overnight . 
police said the violence had its origin in fights that broke out on Wednesday as Turkish fans celebrated a victory over the Netherlands by their national side . 
Kurds make up about a fifth of Germany &apos;s population of more than two million Turks . 
German police attribute dozens of attacks on Turkish properties in the last few years to Kurds sympathising with militants in Turkey who are waging a guerrilla war for Kurdish secession .
