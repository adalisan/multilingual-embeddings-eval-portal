most IMM currency futures ended lower in quiet trade , under pressure from strong U.S. consumer confidence data and firm U.S. asset prices . 
traders said stable Treasury bonds and a rally in U.S. stocks after losses Monday lent a firm tone to the dollar and kept key currencies near session lows most of the day . 
U.S. June consumer confidence was a factor in the sound dollar tone . 
the Conference Board reported its confidence index at 129.6 , the highest since August 1969 . 
the forecast had been for a 126.3 reading . 
traders said they now await Japan &apos;s tankan report . 
the Bank of Japan &apos;s quarterly survey of corporate sentiment was seen as an important key to the BOJ &apos;s monetary policy and would be widely watched as a clue to the Japanese economy , traders said . 
&quot; We &apos;ve got the tankan tonight , and basically the consensus is for a flat report , &quot; one IMM currency analyst said . 
&quot; If it &apos;s positive at all at this point it &apos;ll be bearish for the dollar , &quot; he said . 
the dollar was firm all session , overcoming overnight worries that Japan might be tempted to sell U.S. treasuries for gold . 
Japanese Prime Minister Hashimoto &apos;s answer to a question Monday afternoon raised that concern , weighing on dollar / yen and U.S. stocks late Monday and overnight . 
later , however , Japan &apos;s Finance Ministry said Hashimoto &apos;s remarks had been misunderstood , and the dollar returned to positive ground . 
by Tuesday afternoon , most currencies languished near the bottom of the day &apos;s range . 
traders said action was thin , and noted no reaction to an as-expected Treasury two-year note auction or to the latest Redbook retail sales index , which rose 1.6 percent . 
&quot; They stayed in the ranges and the dollar stayed on the bid side , &quot; a currency futures trader said . 
another trader said mark / yen cross activity would likely remain the focus and reflect reaction to the tankan report . 
&quot; People are expecting a pretty poor report and that &apos;s what people are looking to , &quot; he said . 
at the close , September yen was up $ 0.000004 to $ 0.008805 , marks fell $ 0.0021 to $ 0.5831 , Swiss francs fell $ 0.0042 to $ 0.7011 , sterling fell $ 0.0058 to $ 1.6624 , Canadian dollars fell $ 0.0019 to $ 0.7228 and Mexican pesos were $ 0.000150 higher at $ 0.121600 .
