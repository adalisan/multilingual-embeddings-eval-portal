Argentina &apos;s foreign minister told the General Assembly on Monday that Britain and his country should begin discussing who holds sovereignty over the Falkland Islands , saying the two nations have built a constructive relationship on other issues . 
&quot; During the last six years , I have come to this forum to express the claims of the Argentine people and government in the dispute of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands , &quot; Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said , using the Spanish name of the islands over which the two countries went to war in 1982 . 
&quot; It is hard to understand that , while Argentina and the United Kingdom have overcome the sorrow and have left behind their mutual disagreements and distrusts to build up a constructive relationship , they have not been able , up to now , to fulfil the General Assembly resolutions and those of the ( U.N. ) decolonization Committee , and to progress through dialogue towards definitive solution to the dispute . 
while Britain and Argentina have reached agreement on such issues as fisheries and oil exploration , Britain declines to discuss its claim to sovereignty over the Falklands . 
Di Tella said the two countries should advance in their search for a peaceful solution to the dispute with the same spirit that encouraged their cooperation in the South Atlantic for the protection of its resources . 
he said the lack of direct links with the islands impeded human contacts , trade and tourism , among other possible exchanges , and hindered the economic and cultural development of the South Atlanic . 
saying Argentina was proud of its cultural diversity , he continued , &quot; Our constitution establishes the objective of recovering the Malvinas Islands and the full exercise of our sovereignty , and it ensures respect for its inhabitants &apos; lifestyle . 
the only thing lacking is the will to start a new phase . 
&quot; Argentina is firmly convinced that a new era should begin in the South Atlantic , as an area free from tensions -- a place where different cultures committed to humanistic ideals and with a common wish for progress and well-being are to meet . 
exercising his right of reply at the end of the day , British deputy U.N. representative Stephen Gomersall said he was glad the Argentine foreign minister referred to the increasing cooperation between their two countries and he hoped the progress achieved would be further developed . 
&quot; But my government does not accept the foreign minister &apos;s remarks about sovereignty , &quot; he added . 
&quot; We have no doubt about Britain &apos;s sovereignty over the Falkland Islands and the other British territories in the South Atlantic . 
&quot; In the Falkland Islands we must heed the wishes of the people , &quot; Gomersall said . 
many families traced their ancestry in the island back for five or six generations and the elected representatives of the islanders had reiterated their view that they did not want to be part of Argentina , he added .
