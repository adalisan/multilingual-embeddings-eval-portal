Indonesian cocoa prices were slightly lower on Wednesday from a week ago in line with falls in New York but sellers were still keen on doing business at current values , traders said . 
they said cocoa was quoted at 2,775-2,800 rupiah / kg in Ujung Pandang , capital of the key growing region of South Sulawesi , compared with 2,800-2,850 rupiah a week ago . 
one trader said the mid-crop harvest was gaining momentum , with exports from Ujung Pandang touching 13,000 tonnes in the first half of October . 
&quot; Exports in September were about 11,750 tonnes , &quot; the Ujung Pandang trader said . 
&quot; The mid-crop is looking very good , and my estimate of exports for October is 20,000 to 25,000 tonnes , &quot; he said . 
&quot; arrivals have been no less than 500 tonnes per day . 
another trader said farmers were keen to sell at current prices , but added they would likely hold back sales if prices fell below 2,750 rupiah / kg . 
&quot; Although prices are weaker from a week ago , farmers are still keen on selling . 
but they will begin to hold back if prices start going below 2,750 rupiah , &quot; the trader said . 
&quot; Farmers are keeping a close eye on terminal prices ( in New York ) and know when to sell and when to hold , &quot; he added . 
another trader said cocoa production in Sulawesi totalled 166,000 tonnes between January and September , and that it was expected to touch 210,000 by the end of the year . 
he said the on-going mid-crop harvest was at its peak currently and would last until the end of next month . 
&quot; Although the harvest is generally good , it is not going to be as big as last year because we are continuing to face problems due to the pod-borer pest , &quot; he said . 
he said farmers were expected to continue selling their crop at current prices . 
&quot; If they hold back because of lower prices , it will only be for a few days .
