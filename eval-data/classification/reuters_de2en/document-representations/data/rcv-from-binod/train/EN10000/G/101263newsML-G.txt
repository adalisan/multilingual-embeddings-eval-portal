Vietnam said on Monday it had put to death a man convicted of murder , marking the latest in a series of recent reported executions . 
the Lao Dong ( Labour ) newspaper said Pham Van Manh , born in 1972 , had attacked a colleague with a knife during an argument last year in a town near Hanoi . 
he then ran amok killing a passer-by , the report said . 
his execution took place on October 2 . 
executions in Vietnam are carried out by firing squad and normally go unreported . 
however , details of several have appeared in the country &apos;s state-controlled media in recent weeks .
