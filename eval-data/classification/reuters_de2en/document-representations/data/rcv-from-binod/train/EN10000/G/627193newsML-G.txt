Italy announced on Friday that it was replacing its controversial ambassador to Albania and said Prime Minister Romano Prodi would pay a one-day visit to the unstable Balkan country on Sunday . 
Manfredo Incisa di Camerana , a former ambassador to Mozambique , is to replace Paolo Foresti , who last week embarrassed the Italian government after allegations that he was biased in favour of Albania &apos;s embattled President Sali Berisha . 
the charges were made by an Albanian opposition newspaper which carried a purported transcript of a telephone conversation in which Foresti appears to offer to help broker a deal with the Albanian opposition in Berisha &apos;s favour . 
Foresti has called the transcript a fabrication but diplomatic sources said the controversy had accelerated the search for a successor . 
Prodi will reach Tirana on Sunday afternoon and hold talks with Berisha and Prime Minister Bashkim Fino , sources in Prodi &apos;s office said . 
he is then scheduled to visit the headquarters of an Italian-led multinational force , deployed in Albania to safeguard aid supplies , and to hold a news conference before returning to Rome . 
Italy , with strong trade ties to Albania and anxious to stem an influx of illegal immigrants from across the Adriatic , has played an active part in international efforts to halt the impoverished state &apos;s slide into anarchy . 
rioting and looting broke out in February and March when anger at the collapse of investment schemes snowballed into an uprising against Berisha in the south of the former communist country . 
France , Spain , Romania , Turkey , Greece , Austria and Denmark also contributed troops to the 6,000-strong multinational force . 
Italy championed the installation in March of a national unity government led by Fino , of the opposition Socialist Party , under an accord designed to lead to early parliamentary elections on June 29 .
