Israel &apos;s gross domestic product will expand 3.9 percent this year , slowing from an estimated 4.4 percent in 1996 , Bank Leumi said in a report released on Wednesday . 
&quot; In relation to 1996 , growth in 1997 is expected to be led more by exports and less by ( domestic ) consumption , &quot; the bank &apos;s economists said . 
&quot; ( But ) the full impact of corrective policy , which is likely to be expressed in lower real interest rates than last year and a small real devaluation , will only be felt in 1998 . 
Leumi said it expected inflation to fall to 9.5 percent this year , from 10.6 percent in 1996 and at the upper end of the government &apos;s seven to 10 percent target . 
the base interest rate will fall to a real three to four percent , which should enable the Israeli shekel to depreciate nine percent against the official currency basket over the year . 
&quot; A devaluation of this rate is higher than the difference between Israeli inflation and inflation of most of the currency basket countries , &quot; Leumi said . 
&quot; Therefore it is likely to improve export profitability and enhance the competitiveness of local producers against imports . 
as a result , merchandise exports will grow eight percent , compared with six percent in 1996 , while civilian merchandise import growth will slow to four percent from 7.6 percent last year . 
the bank forecast a 4.5 percent increase in aggregate consumption , down sharply from an estimated 6.1 percent in 1996 and 7.3 percent in 1995 . 
growth in per capita consumption will fall to two percent , &quot; a lower rate than forecast for most industrialised countries , &quot; Leumi said . 
investment growth is expected to decline to 1.5 percent , with investment in residential construction falling five percent . 
after several years of declining unemployment , Leumi said the jobless rate would rise to seven percent this year from an estimated 6.5 percent in 1996 .
