CSCE coffee futures ended sharply higher on Tuesday as technically driven local and speculative buying propelled the September contract past $ 2 per lb for the first time in eight weeks , traders said . 
benchmark September arabicas jumped to a session high of 204.50 cents per lb before some light profit-taking trimmed gains . 
at the close , September stood at 203.10 , up 9.35 . 
Second-month December rose 6.00 cents , to 174.70 , while the back months closed 1.95 to 3.70 higher . 
Arabica prices headed higher at the outset , defying a 1.00 cent lower pre-opening call , as locals followed through on Monday &apos;s rally . 
in the past two consecutive sessions , September coffee has gained a hefty 18.15 cents -- or nearly 10 percent -- amid persistent concerns about a shortage of exchange-certified coffees for delivery against the September contract . 
&quot; It &apos;s the same thing : a lack of supply , &quot; said Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes . 
&quot; There &apos;s very little coffee available for delivery . 
the September / December switch , a barometer of near-term availability , bulged to 28.40 cents compared with 25.05 cents at the close on Monday . 
with little coffee expected to make its way to the exchange ahead of the autumn harvest of many new-crop Latin American coffees , many market participants foresee a drawdown of certified stocks going into September delivery period that begins on August 21 . 
&quot; It &apos;s all in anticipation of the same event : that there &apos;s going to be tight stocks , &quot; said Smith Barney analyst Walt Spilka . 
&quot; inevitably , the September open position on August 21 is going to be greater than the amount of coffee delivered . 
Spilka said reports of dry weather in Central America -- which may adversely impact the harvest -- and uncertainty about the size of top-producer Brazil &apos;s 1997 / 98 crop also fueled bullish sentiment . 
&quot; Dry conditions in Central America are slightly positive , &quot; he said . 
&quot; And the fact that groups in Brazil keep coming up with small estimates leads people to wonder what size the crop really is . 
last week , the Brazilian government reaffirmed its 22 million-bag projection for the 1997 / 98 coffee crop . 
crop forecasts for the Brazil crop have ranged widely from an 18-million bag estimate by private Brazilian forecasters to the USDA &apos;s estimate of 28 million bags . 
technically , traders said today &apos;s run-up accelerated after the September contract breached key chart resistance at 198.00 cents and then 200.00 , triggering buy-stops . 
they continued to note that relatively light turnover , low total open interest and a lack of producer participation exaggerated the market &apos;s run-up . 
as of August 4 , total open interest stood at 21,195 lots , up 558 lots from the previous session . 
after Tuesday &apos;s close the CSCE reported certified coffee stocks fell by 1,344 60-kg bags as of August 4 , to 93,397 bags . 
an additional 4,679 bags were pending grading , the exchange said . 
also after Tuesday &apos;s close , Colombia &apos;s National Coffee Growers &apos; Federation said it was closing August registrations for federation and private coffee exports on August 8 at 1900 local / 2400 GMT and opening all September coffee registrations on August 11 . 
in a statement , the federation confirmed it would maintain the 0.30 cent premium on Colombian coffee . 
volume on the day reached an estimated 8,146 lots .
