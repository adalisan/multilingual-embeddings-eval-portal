European Union transport ministers began a meeting on Tuesday to discuss a series of air safety issues headed by plans for coordinated checks on the airworthiness of third-country aircraft using EU airports . 
Tuesday &apos;s talks are due to touch on other air safety questions such as air traffic control , as well as wider transport issues such as lorry taxes , the creation of high-speed rail freight routes across Europe and measures to reduce Europe &apos;s annual road-death toll . 
coordinated aircraft inspections are part of EU efforts to improve air safety after the crash of a Birgen Air Boeing aircraft off the Dominican Republic in February 1996 . 
the crash , which U.S. and Dominican investigators blamed on human error , killed all of the 189 people on board , most of whom were German tourists . 
draft rules are intended to ensure the creation of a data pool on suspect operators , the set-up of inspection systems including the possibility of grounding aircraft which fail , and the development of follow-up systems . 
Ministers will focus on whether the draft rules should apply to EU aircraft as well , an option backed by Britain , Germany and Sweden but opposed by others .
