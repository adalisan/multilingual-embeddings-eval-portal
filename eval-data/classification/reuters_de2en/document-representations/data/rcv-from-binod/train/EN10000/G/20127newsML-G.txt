Belgian police extended their search for bodies on Wednesday at a house owned by the chief suspect in the scandal of child kidnapping , porn and killing that has stunned Europe . 
at the same time the lawyer of convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux , the man at the centre of the storm , refused on moral grounds to defend him . 
Belgium was plunged into a state of shock 11 days ago after Dutroux led police to the bodies of eight-year-old friends Melissa Russo and Julie Lejeune in his garden . 
buried with them was an accomplice Bernard Weinstein , whom he admitted killing . 
&quot; I have a little girl of Julie and Melissa &apos;s age , who has been really disturbed by these events , and I don &apos;t think she could have understood that her father was defending this man , &quot; lawyer Didier de Quevy told Belgian radio . 
Dutroux and associate Michel Lelievre have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment . 
two other girls , Laetitia Delhez , 14 , and Sabine Dardenne , 12 , were rescued on August 15 from a makeshift dungeon in another of the six houses Dutroux owns in and around the southern city of Charleroi . 
Dutroux has also confessed to kidnapping teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrechts who disappeared from the port of Ostend a year ago . 
their fate remains unknown . 
while hope flickers that An and Eefje may still be alive , speculation has grown in the Belgian media that five bodies might be hidden at the site in Jumet , near Charleroi . 
the house has been the scene of intense police activity since Tuesday . 
battling against heavy rain , investigators used an excavator in the yard - which had been cleared of debris - and were completing digging beneath a concrete floor in a shed at four spots located on Tuesday by sniffer dogs . 
&quot; We &apos;re looking for all possible indications , but of course primarily bodies , &quot; gendarmerie spokesman Major Jean-Marie Boudin told reporters . 
nothing had been found by mid-afternoon . 
the spots were being excavated to a depth of two metres ( 6-1 / 2 feet ) , and the hole in the garden to six metres . 
Boudin said the basement of the house was also being cleared out to allow sniffer dogs to search there . 
foreign experts have been helping at the site where Dutroux has suggested areas to dig . 
Prosecutor Michel Bourlet has however warned that Dutroux was calculating and highly manipulative . 
Britain &apos;s superintendent John Bennett who supervised excavations in the Fred and Rosemary West &quot; House of horrors &quot; murder case in England two years ago , arrived last week . 
there were also reports of fresh searches at other sites including Dutroux &apos; house in Sars-La-Buissiere where Melissa and Julies &apos; bodies were hidden . 
Dutroux said the girls , who disappeared in June 1995 , starved to death early this year , He denies killing them but admits paying accomplices 40,000 francs ( $ 1,300 ) to kidnap them . 
as the searches continued in Belgium , Dutroux was named in Bratislava as a suspect in the murder of a young Slovak woman . 
the Slovak office of Interpol said he was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one Slovak woman . 
so far 10 people have been arrested in what has now become known as the &quot; Dutroux Affair &quot; , including Doutroux &apos; second wife Michelle Martin who has been charged as an accomplice . 
there has been widespread anger over revelations of police bungling , and the Justice Ministry has ordered an inquiry . 
a chief police detective has also been arrested on fraud charges , fuelling questions about a possible high-level cover-up . 
at least 15 children have gone missing in Belgium in the past six years . 
to date seven have been found dead , two have been rescued and six are still officially listed as missing .
