Philippine Treasury bills firmed further on Thursday as secondary market traders nudged their offer quotes higher to attract potential buyers , traders said . 
&quot; But there were no willing buyers . 
everybody was on the selling side , trying to junk all of their positions , &quot; one trader said . 
the anticipation of higher domestic interest rates was bolstered earlier in the day when the Central Bank raised its term reverse repo rates . 
&quot; This is a definite signal that the interest rate will continually move up in the coming days , &quot; another trader said . 
traders were lightening their T-bill holdings in the hope of buying higher-yielding Treasury bills at Monday &apos;s weekly auction . 
they were expecting another 40 to 50 basis point hikes across all maturities . 
offers by eight banks surveyed by Reuters showed rates between 10.60 and 10.85 percent for three-month bills , significantly higher than the average auction rate posted last Monday . 
offers for six-month bills ranged from 11.00 to 11.30 percent , while offers for one-year bills were from 11.40 to 11.60 percent . 
&quot; As long as the Thai baht remains under pressure , we will see domestic rates to be on the high end , &quot; the trader said . 
the Central Bank has been raising its benchmark rates to ward off speculative attacks on the Philippine peso as a result of the Thai baht &apos;s troubles . 
domestic liquidity remained loose depressing the overnight money rate to 15.03125 percent from Wednesday &apos;s 15.0625 percent .
