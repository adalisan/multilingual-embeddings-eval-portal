the won ended Wednesday &apos;s trading at its upper limit as corporations rushed to sell dollars after the central Bank of Korea ( BOK ) took an aggressive stance in support of the local unit , traders said . 
the won close at its limit of 859.00 , compared with Tuesday &apos;s close of 870.50 . 
it opened at a day low of 865.00 . 
after the won surged to its limit , dollar buying sentiment became so frozen the BOK bid to absorb dollars , traders said . 
&quot; Today was a stop-loss market , &quot; said a western bank dealer . 
volume was active at $ 2.7 billion . 
on Tuesday , a senior BOK official said the bank would seek strong measures to stabilise won &apos;s sharp depreciation . 
the central bank has recently been actively selling dollars to slow the won &apos;s fall , dealers said . 
the central bank has refused to confirm or deny talk of its intervention in the interbank market . 
a foreign bank dealer said that he expected corporate selling would continue on Thursday . 
&quot; A key factor is the speculative dollar positions bought by corporates and how much they are going to sell off , &quot; he said . 
but fundamental factors continue to point to a strong dollar , traders said . 
the local unit is under pressure from the dollar &apos;s continued strength on world markets , a snowballing trade deficit . 
&quot; In the short term , the dollar will go down because of the central bank , but it will be hard to keep the dollar down unless the greenback weakens overseas , &quot; a local trader said . 
dealers said the won could rise to around the 853 level on Thursday . 
Thursday &apos;s base mid-rate was pegged at 859.30 , against Wednesday &apos;s 878.70 .
