Olympic and world giant slalom champion Deborah Compagnoni won a women &apos;s Alpine skiing giant slalom on Sunday , the first World Cup victory in Italy of her 10-year career . 
Compagnoni , winner of a slalom before Christmas and back-to-back giants in the German resort of Zwiesel at the end of last week , clocked an unofficial combined time of two minutes 38.25 seconds down the Olimpia delle Tofane piste . 
Germany &apos;s Katja Seizinger , who won the first giant of the season in Soelden , Austria , was second in 2 : 38.84 and Switzerland &apos;s Sonja Nef was third in 2 : 39.67 . 
it was the 11th career World Cup win for Compagnoni and the third in succession , giving her a huge confidence boost but also adding to the pressure on her for the world championships in Sestriere which open next Sunday . 
the top three positions were unchanged from the first leg , which Compagnoni dominated despite minor mistakes . 
fog shrouded part of the course during the first leg while snow fell steadily during the second . 
&quot; The visibility wasn &apos;t the best , &quot; said Seizinger . 
Italy &apos;s Isolde Kostner , who won Friday &apos;s downhill with Switzerland &apos;s Heidi Zurbriggen and then also took Saturday &apos;s super-G , missed a gate halfway down the first leg . 
compatriot Sabina Panzanini , who won giants in Park City and Maribor , did not start the race due to a left Achilles tendon problem . 
team officials said Panzanini had returned home to nearby Merano and had decided to rest . 
they said the injury , which Panzanini first noticed in Maribor and which flared up in Zwiesel , did not threaten her world championships .
