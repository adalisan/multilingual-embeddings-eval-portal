U.S. cash crude prices firmed Thursday morning tracking technically-inspired NYMEX buying , while June domestic grade barrels were mixed . 
July West Texas Intermediate / Cushing was around 15 cents stronger at $ 22.00- $ 22.10 . 
June WTI was around 20 cents below July at $ 21.80-90 a barrel , with traders spotting deals on the roll at that level . 
other deals were seen for Heavy Louisiana sweet / Empire at -70 cents to the June WTI / Cushing , and West Texas sour / Midland at - $ 1.30 . 
June postings were unchanged from Wednesday at $ 1.75 . 
light Louisiana sweet / St. 
James continued to flounder at a 20-28 cents discount . 
foreign crude avails and lack of refiner demand for June barrels deflated differentials , traders said . 
traders spent much of the morning tracking NYMEX crude deliveries against the June contract . 
NYMEX said 2.372 million barrels of crude were delivered against the paper contract , of which nearly all , or 2.349 million barrels were foreign crudes . 
traders said much of the crude was Nigerian bonny Light , putting the trade companies that received the foreigns in a bad position , considering they were forced to pay a 60 cents premium for the bonny . 
July Exchange for Physicals were tracked around a eight to nine cents premium , an indicator more foreign deliveries were expected next month , traders said .
