Bogota , April 16 Reuter - Colombian shares ended mostly lower in active trade that saw major selling in some financially troubled companies and profit-taking in others that posted recent gains . 
Medellin &apos;s IBOMED general price index ended down 0.19 percent at 17,258.90 on above-average trading volume of about 4.6 billion pesos . 
Bogota &apos;s IBB closed down a razor-thin 0.04 percent , meanwhile , ending at 1,129.62 on a volume of 2.3 billion pesos . 
brewing giant Bavaria , flagship of the Julio Mario Santo Domingo conglomerate , led most actives in Bogota and Medellin . 
it fell victim to active profit-taking on both exchanges , a day after ING Barings said it cut the stock from buy to hold because it saw little upside following its recent rally . 
the stock , which has outperformed the market by 53 percent in dollar terms this year , fell 1.60 percent in Bogota to end at 7,950 pesos per share . 
&quot; It &apos;s logical for people with shares in Bavaria that they bought at 4,000 or 5,000 pesos to go out and sell , &quot; one Bogota-based broker said . 
other losers included Bancoquia , Colombia &apos;s eighth largest bank , which lost 3.13 percent in Medellin to end at 3,100 pesos per share . 
dealers attributed the downward move to unexplained delays in the bank &apos;s previously announced plans to sell a 55 percent stake to Spain &apos;s Banco Santander . 
gains included Banco de Bogota , which added 3.17 percent and closed at 6,500 pesos per share on news of strong January-February earnings . 
&quot; The figures confirm that Bogota is the highest yielding bank , &quot; one broker said . 
big losers were led steel mill Acerias Paz del Rio and capital goods supplier Distral , which shed 33 percent and 32.6 percent of their share value , respectively , on local news reports describing them as at or near bankruptcy .
