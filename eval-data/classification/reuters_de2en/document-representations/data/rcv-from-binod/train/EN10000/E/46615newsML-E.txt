Georgia &apos;s Jackson County Board of Education authorized superintendent Andy Byers to borrow $ 2 million to cover gaps in the school system budget until 1996 taxes are collected , Athens banner Herald reported Wednesday . 
the school board also proposed raising the property tax rate by 2.5 mills for fiscal 1997 to cover construction and renovation costs and the cost of enrollment growth . 
the board was scheduled to vote on the new rate Sept 26 . 
Byers said the millage rate hike was associated with a recently approved amendment that granted tax exemptions on manufactured goods in storage in the county . 
the freeport amendment was intended to attract new industries to Jackson County , but the reduction of taxable goods and property decreased taxes collected for schools . 
the value of taxable property and goods in the county grew by more than $ 59 million from 1995 to 1996 , but the new exemptions reduced the net increase to $ 10 million .
