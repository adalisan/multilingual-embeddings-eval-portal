India &apos;s major political parties on Monday prepared for an uncertain verdict in northern Uttar Pradesh state where local elections are expected to effect changes in Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda &apos;s ruling alliance . 
officials in India &apos;s most populous state , which borders Nepal and Tibet , reported about 50 percent turnout at the end of the third phase of polls for the 425-member state assembly . 
&quot; polling was peaceful , barring a few minor incidents of attempted rigging , &quot; a polling official in Sitapur , 60 km ( 37.5 miles ) east of the state capital of Lucknow , told Reuters . 
Sitapur was one of 124 polling venues on Monday . 
five contests have been postponed to Wednesday , three of them over violence , including Hindu-Moslem clashes , in Lucknow . 
the contest has pitted India &apos;s ruling United Front against an alliance of former prime minister P.V. 
Narasimha Rao &apos;s Congress party and the low-caste Hindu Bahujan Samaj Party . 
the rightist Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , widely tipped to emerge as the single largest group , is the third force in the contest . 
tens of thousands of paramilitary forces were deployed to monitor the polls , state officials said . 
officials sealed the 700 km ( 420 mile ) land border with Nepal to ensure peaceful voting . 
with 140 million people , Uttar Pradesh is larger than France and more populous than Japan or Pakistan . 
it has a history of violent elections . 
at least 16 people were killed in poll-related violence in the month-long campaign for the state assembly involving 90 million registered voters . 
politicians say the election is a test of DEVE Gowda &apos;s ability to see off a challenge by BJP , India &apos;s main opposition group . 
Uttar Pradesh sends 85 deputies to the 545-member federal parliament , where the BJP is the single biggest party . 
the party &apos;s campaign to build a Hindu temple on the site of a 16th century mosque catapulted it to power in several north Indian states and made it the main opposition party in parliament in 1991 . 
militant supporters of the BJP demolished the Babri mosque in Ayodhya , 200 km ( 120 miles ) east of Lucknow , in December 1992 . 
their action triggered nationwide Hindu-Moslem riots in which more than 3,000 people died . 
Hindu militants claim two more mosques , in the western city of Mathura and in Varanasi on the state &apos;s eastern flank , saying they stand on sites of ancient Hindu temples . 
while the BJP played down the issue in its campaign , the government has taken no chances and staggered the polls over three days to ensure voting near each of the three disputed sites was conducted on different days . 
analysts say the state , once a bastion of the Congress party that has ruled India for all but four years since independence in 1947 , could follow a recent trend of coalition politics that helped DEVE Gowda form a minority government in June .
