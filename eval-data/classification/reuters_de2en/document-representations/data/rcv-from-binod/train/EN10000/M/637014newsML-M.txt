MGE spring wheat futures settled lower on spillover weakness from outside markets , and traders said both intermarket and intramarket spreading were featured activities . 
&quot; Early in the session we had a wave of buying Minneapolis , selling Kansas City and Chicago July , and that &apos;s what kept us relatively firm , &quot; a MGE trader said . 
&quot; But around noon things started to change . 
buyers of the spread weren &apos;t as aggressive and there was profit taking in the intermarket spread , &quot; the trader said . 
spring wheat also drew pressure from other U.S. wheat markets , which were lower on fund selling and on general harvest-related weakness . 
wheat also saw spillover pressure from CBOT soybeans , which collapsed on news Cargill was importing Brazilian soybeans to the United States . 
MGE spring wheat settled one to 3-3 / 4 cents per bushel lower , with July down 3-3 / 4 cents at $ 3.86 . 
new crop September lost one cent to close at $ 3.82-1 / 2 . 
traders said September drew support from light mill buying amid sluggish volumes .
