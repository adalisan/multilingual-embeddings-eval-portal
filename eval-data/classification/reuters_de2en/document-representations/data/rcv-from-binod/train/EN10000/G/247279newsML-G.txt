he looks more like a dust bowl folk singer than an exhilarating rocker whose concerts once turned a stadium into a giant party . 
Bruce Springsteen is on the road again , armed with an acoustic guitar and a harmonica and singing about hard times , broken dreams and the struggles of people society left behind . 
the inspiration for the new songs on the stark , spare &quot; The Ghost of Tom Joad &quot; album came from watching the John Ford film of John Steinbeck &apos;s &quot; The Grapes of wrath , &quot; Springsteen told the audience at a recent Fort Lauderdale concert . 
&quot; I wanted to do some work that will find its way into people &apos;s lives and maybe mean something . 
Tom Joad risked what he had for something that was bigger than he was , &quot; he said , referring to the protagonist in Steinbeck &apos;s classic novel of the Great Depression . 
in going down his new path , Springsteen has done just that . 
now aged 47 , he has left behind the joyous , raucous days with his legendary E Street band , which peaked in popularity in the mid-1980s with &quot; Born in the USA . 
&quot; But if his shows are less thrilling now , they are sobering and often deeply moving . 
sometimes bitter and sometimes wistful , Springsteen sings in &quot; Straight Time &quot; of an ex-convict tempted back into crime , in &quot; The Line &quot; of Mexican immigrants sneaking across the border at night and in &quot; Galveston Bay &quot; of the struggles between Vietnamese refugees and local fishermen on the Texas coast . 
U.S. military veterans are also close to his heart . 
at Fort Lauderdale , he appealed to concert-goers to support the local veterans &apos; association and he donated the profits from sales of tour merchandise to them . 
in his new guise , &quot; Born in the USA , &quot; a song about a veteran &apos;s return that Springsteen once had to tell President Ronald Reagan was not a patriotic anthem , is turned from the bombastic rock of the original into an anguished cry . 
other old songs are also given a new treatment . 
&quot; Promised Land &quot; was once a celebration of being young and heading out in the world . 
now , in a slow , bluesy version , it is clear that Springsteen no longer believes in a promised land . 
Springsteen rarely gives interviews but in lengthy preambles to songs at his concert here he offered some glimpses of his thinking . 
in a hint of his thoughts on the glory days , he refers to &quot; that &apos; Born in the USA &apos; bulls--- &quot; . 
introducing &quot; Straight Time &quot; he said : &quot; It &apos;s hard to step out to go to a place you &apos;ve never been , even if your life depends on it . 
if the new &quot; Boss &quot; seems somewhat dour and serious these days , the three-hour show was far from an unbroken chronicle of misery . 
he is a born storyteller , spinning wry and witty tales in song introductions and cracking plenty of jokes . 
a wealthy man , Springsteen is adored by his fans and respected by critics . 
after his divorce from model Julianne Philips he has been happily married for several years to his former back-up singer Patti Scialfa and has a young family . 
but he is nonetheless convincing as a champion of the downtrodden . 
in October , he was made the first recipient of the &quot; In the souls of the People &quot; award honouring Steinbeck from the San Jose State University &apos;s Steinbeck Research Centre . 
presenting the award , Steinbeck &apos;s widow Elaine said the songwriter and the novelist both loved the same people . 
and on stage this month , Springsteen told how moved he was by a scene in &quot; The Grapes of wrath &quot; when Joad , having killed a man , must leave the family with which he has crossed America in search of a better life . 
&quot; When the world has dealt hard blows , people fall back on love , faith and family , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Because ultimately that &apos;s all there is .
