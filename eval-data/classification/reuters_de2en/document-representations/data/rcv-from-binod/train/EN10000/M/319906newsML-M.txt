new Zealand &apos;s top 40 share index ended within striking distance of a three-year high after a holiday-affected Monday session . 
the NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 10.65 points stronger at 2,440.21 , its highest level since reaching 2,444.80 in early February , 1994 . 
don Turkington at Cavill White Securities said it was an encouraging start to the week . 
volume , worth NZ $ 47.4 million , was reasonable given today &apos;s holiday in Wellington , he said . 
the fact that the index had broken over 2,440 was significant . 
&quot; Generally the tone was extremely good , &quot; Turkington said . 
the next signficant chart level would be 2,455 , a post-crash high set in September 1989 , when the index was called the Barclays . 
most leaders were either firm or steady , the exception being Fletcher Paper , which dropped one cent to close at NZ $ 2.98 .
