Mediterranean oil products were mostly weaker on Monday , traders said . 
gasoline held steady on the back of solid U.S. interest , tight supplies of low octane material that is needed in eastern Mediterranean , and high freight rates . 
&quot; We are still receiving fairly good demand for gasoline , mainly unleaded and for U.S. destinations ... and low octane for the eastern Med , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; The Med is tight . 
Naphtha fell slightly but traders await the outcome of at least three large cargoes expected to head either to NWE , the U.S. or Brazil . 
another rumoured possibility was to Tarragona . 
gas oil continued weak with avails growing as buyers stay relaxed and on the sidelines , traders said . 
&quot; The market is looking fairly long nothing is being talked at a premium anymore , &quot; one trader said . 
traders said weaker NWE markets had also compounded the effect of slack local demand , good supply situation cutting off another outlet for surplus Med product . 
quotes related premiums for Russian gas oil cargoes remained under pressure from good avails with a cargo traded into Genoa at around CIF high - $ 1 / $ 1.50 a tonne . 
FOD and diesel cargo differentials were also weaker at around 50 cents to $ 1 a tonne under benchmark quotes . 
high sulphur fuel was steady to weaker . 
a Syrian tender issued last week to sell two 50,000 tonne cargoes was heard cancelled as bids were considered too weak . 
but the oil is still thought to be there . 
dealers said talk of imminent refinery run cuts could tighten the supply picture and give some support . 
low sulphur fuel oil was steady to weaker . 
Turkey &apos;s Tupras tendered to buy one 50,000 tonne cargo for delivery between February 20-25 .
