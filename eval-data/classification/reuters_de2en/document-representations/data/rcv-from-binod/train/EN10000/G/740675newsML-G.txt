a Hong Kong fashion designer came under fire on Friday after he sent his models down the catwalk with hypodermic syringes sticking out of their clothes . 
but William Tang , who was criticised by anti-drug workers for promoting so-called &quot; heroin chic &quot; , called the syringes merely &quot; witty accessories &quot; that depicted the real Hong Kong . 
it &apos;s a fact , it happens in our society . 
it &apos;s the landscape of Hong Kong , &quot; Tang told Reuters . 
&quot; If you look closely , you see the bodies of the models are deformed , so I am making the statement that this is a deformed society , &quot; he said , referring to how the models had huge lumps protruding from under their clothes . 
but anti-drug workers were not amused by the designs of Tang , who draws his inspiration from street dwellers and the gangster underworld . 
&quot; There are just so many other creative things you can do for a show . 
why do you have to pick something illegal and life-threatening which causes so much sorrow ? 
&quot; a social worker said . 
Italian fashion guru Gianni Versace , who was shot dead in Miami Beach on Tuesday , said in one of his last interviews before he died that &quot; heroin chic &quot; had had its day and that the time had come to rediscover beauty and decorum . 
U.S. President Bill Clinton earlier this year criticised the fashion industry for promoting the allure of heroin , saying it was wrong to &quot; glamourise addiction to sell clothes . 
the trend has been prominent in recent years in fashion magazines and advertisements featuring Gaunt models who appeared to be in a stupor .
