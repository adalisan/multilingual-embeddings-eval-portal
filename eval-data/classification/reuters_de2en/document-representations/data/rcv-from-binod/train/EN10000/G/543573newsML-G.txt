Colombian police forced three suspected leftist rebels to lie about the role a German couple played in a controversial kidnap case , according to official documents made public on Monday . 
private investigator Werner Mauss and his wife , Isabel , were arrested near the northwest city of Medellin last November as they attempted to take a third German , Brigitte Schoene , aboard a plane and smuggle her out of the country . 
seven alleged members of the National Liberation Army ( ELN ) guerrilla force were captured shortly afterwards and said Mauss had links to the rebel army and had acted as a go-between in the kidnap in return for a cut of the ransom . 
but in documents sent to Reuters by Mauss &apos; attorney , Karl Wenzel , three of the suspected guerrillas retracted their statements and said they had been threatened and forced to give false evidence . 
the regional prosecutor has presented all its evidence and said the judge would have to weigh the importance of the three retractions . 
Colombia &apos;s attorney general also joined the controversy , calling for Mauss &apos; wife to be released for lack of evidence . 
the police and local government officials in the province of Antioquia , where the pair were arrested , have accused the German couple of being international members of the liberation army or mercenaries getting rich by negotiating ransoms . 
the German government said Mauss &apos; was engaged in a &quot; humanitarian &quot; mission and it had issued him with official letters and other documents to help him . 
Mauss and his wife are currently in custody in separate prisons near Medellin .
