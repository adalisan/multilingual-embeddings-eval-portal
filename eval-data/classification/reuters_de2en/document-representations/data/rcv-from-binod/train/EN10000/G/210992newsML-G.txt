U.S. President Bill Clinton looked , and acted , as if he were a new father on Friday when he cradled Chelsea -- a nine-month-old Koala named after his daughter . 
grinning to the throng of media gathered for &quot; The shot &quot; of his five-day Australian visit , Clinton talked softly to the tiny Koala . 
&quot; hey little guy meet your mommy , &quot; Clinton said to the Koala as he faced &quot; Chelsea &quot; towards another Koala . 
Clinton , who looked as if he may be blushing with pride , but was probably only red-faced from the tropical sun , told reporters : &quot; She is beautiful &quot; . 
&quot; Most people only see pictures of koalas ... 
I had no idea they were so soft , &quot; he told the White House press contingent . 
asked by one reporter what she thought of having a &quot; critter &quot; named after her 16-year-old daughter , Hillary Clinton smiled . 
&quot; We called her ( Chelsea ) this morning and told her we were going to see her namesake , &quot; Bill Clinton said . 
on the second last day of their visit to Australia , the Clintons decided to visit a lush rainforest park -- home to kangaroos , koalas and an assortment of birds . 
as the Clintons strolled through the park near this north Queensland coastal town , a ranger answered their questions about Australia &apos;s unique marsupials , at one stage telling the president that large red kangaroos would tower over his big frame . 
while both Clintons patted the friendly kangaroos , only the president decided to hand feed the animals compressed grain pellets from a brown paper bag . 
&quot; They are just so sweet looking . 
look at their faces and eyes , &quot; said Hillary . 
the kangaroos also charmed the White House press , who once the president had left , brought out their &quot; happy snap &quot; cameras for family album pictures of their encounter with the strange animals from &quot; Down Under &quot; .
