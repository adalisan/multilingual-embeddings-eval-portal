a North Korean diplomat , whose arrest was ordered by Zimbabwean police last month on charges of illegally possessing ivory , was still holed up in his country &apos;s embassy in Harare , Zimbabwean officials said on Thursday . 
they gave no further details but confirmed a story published by the local independent Financial Gazette weekly newspaper that the case of Jang Myong Sik , a counsellor at the North Korean embassy in neighbouring Zambia , was still to be resolved . 
Jang was arrested on January 24 at Harare airport after security staff searched his luggage and allegedly found 33 pieces of raw ivory . 
the police released him to the North Korean embassy in Harare . 
they say they are awaiting the government to advise them on how to handle the case and whether Jang &apos;s diplomatic immunity in Zambia extends to Zimbabwe . 
but Zimbabwe &apos;s head of protocol at the ministry of foreign affairs , Alban Dete , told the Financial Gazette Jang &apos;s immunity did not apply in Zimbabwe but that police could not go into the embassy to arrest him unless approved by the ambassador . 
&quot; ... they ( police ) could prosecute if they so wished and have evidence against him . 
but the embassy premises have immunity and the police cannot arrest anyone there unless permitted by the ambassador , &quot; Dete said . 
trade in ivory was banned worldwide in 1989 . 
under the law in Zimbabwe violaters could face up to five years in jail if convicted . 
North Korean embassy officials refused to comment on the issue .
