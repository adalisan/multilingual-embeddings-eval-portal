Croatia &apos;s ailing president Franjo Tudjman , appearing in a pre-election television interview on Wednesday , said that he was sure to win Sunday &apos;s presidential election and that his health was excellent . 
&quot; ( My election victory ) is not a question . 
this is not my own estimate but ( Croatian ) people are showing me this all the time , &quot; the 75-year old president said . 
&quot; My victory will perhaps be more overwhelming than before ... My two opponents ... will together get twice as few votes as me , &quot; he said . 
he referred to Vlado Gotovac of the Social Liberal party and Zdravko Tomac of the Social Democrats , who will challenge him in Croatia &apos;s presidential election on June 15 , the second since the former Yugoslav republic gained independence in 1991 . 
analysts believe Tudjman will win outright in the first round , but they doubt he will live out his second five-year term in office . 
he is alleged to be suffering from cancer and was treated in a U.S. hospital last November . 
but Tudjman , who looked well and appeared to have gained some weight , sought to put an end to such rumours . 
the president brushed aside Western criticism of his undemocratic rule and too tight a grip on media . 
the media are free , democracy means everybody can speak their minds but it doesn &apos;t mean irresponsibility and anarchy , &quot; he said . 
the Croatian government controls almost all daily papers and the state radio . 
the television , from which most Croats get their daily news , is perceived as a mere mouthpiece for Tudjman &apos;s ruling HDZ ( Croatian Democratic Union ) party . 
asked if he would allow a countrywide private television network , Tudjman said : &quot; Yes , but not ( one ) in the service of foreign interests but of Croatian people . 
he added that Croatia was faced with a psychological warfare waged by domestic and international forces . 
&quot; We are facing an organised activity , including psychological war , aimed at obstructing our independence , waged by a lot of people in Croatia and abroad , who cannot accept Croatia &apos;s sovereignty &quot; . 
in their campaigns his rivals Gotovac and Tomac charged that the power and wealth were concentrated in the hands of the HDZ only and said it was time to change it . 
Tudjman said such allegations about corruption and quick enrichment of the HDZ government members were part of the psychological warfare , aimed at destabilising the country . 
&quot; It is of vital importance that Croatia pursues the policy with which it secured its liberty , &quot; he said .
