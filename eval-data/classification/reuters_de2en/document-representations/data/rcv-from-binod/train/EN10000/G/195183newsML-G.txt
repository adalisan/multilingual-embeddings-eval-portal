residents of Romania &apos;s poverty-stricken villages on Sunday appeared to heed President Ion Iliescu &apos;s warning to vote for him or risk losing their farms to feudal landlords . 
&quot; I voted for Iliescu because he gave us land and pensions , &quot; Ion Caruta said as he unloaded straw from a donkey-drawn cart in Suditi , 150 km ( 90 miles ) east of Bucharest . 
&quot; You heard what Iliescu said . 
if we vote for ( Emil ) Constantinescu the boyars ( landowners ) will return and we will lose everything . 
Iliescu , in power since the 1989 fall of communism , faces a tough run-off battle on Sunday against anti-communist academic Emil Constantinescu . 
in a high-pressure campaign aimed at less educated village residents , the bedrock of his support , Iliescu said Constantinescu would bring back big landowners to seize farmland and shut down heavy industry , costing many jobs . 
Constantinescu dismissed the allegations as nonsense and city voters scoffed at them during campaign rallies . 
but they seemed to have hit their mark with many rural people buffeted by change since the 1989 upheaval . 
&quot; These lies strike a chord with older people , &quot; said Raul Blaha , local organiser for Constantinescu &apos;s Democratic Convention group . 
&quot; They make up the majority in the villages and all they think is Iliescu and again Iliescu . 
independent newspapers rarely reach outlying villages accesible only by badly potholed roads . 
rural residents rely for their news on state television which the opposition says is heavily biased in favour of Iliescu . 
under a 1991 land reform , farmers got back part of the land seized from them under the Communist regime in the 1950s . 
but the reform was delayed and badly implemented . 
lack of funds and equipment and seemingly endless red tape soon turned newly acquired property into a burden for many . 
he protected Romania against wars and gave me a pension , &quot; said Nicolae Batrinu , a 78-year-old war veteran . 
Batrinu , who said he had fought &quot; from the Caucusus to Stalingrad and Vienna &quot; in World War Two , feared electing Constantinescu would mean &quot; losing my four sons in a war &quot; . 
elderly voters seemed to agree with Iliescu &apos;s campaign themes that his cautious brand of reforms had prevented the even steeper economic decline of Bulgaria to the south and conflicts which engulfed Yugoslavia to the west . 
&quot; With Iliescu we have peace and prosperity , &quot; Caruta said , apparently oblivious to his tumbledown clay-brick house and the muddy yard outside . 
on the evening before the election , a power cut plunged all the villages on the road leading to Bucharest into darkness . 
houses and streets were ghostly in the lights of passing cars . 
some young people have begun to wonder out loud whether an alternative to the current leadership might be better . 
&quot; Life is more and more difficult here , &quot; said one young man voting for Constantinescu against the wishes of his family . 
&quot; Prosperity is a remote dream . 
we need a change . 
but Constantinescu has no experience and the country has no money .
