the beginning of face-to-face talks between Peru &apos;s government and Marxist hostage-takers broke a stalemate in the Lima crisis but was not expected to bring a quick solution . 
with the sides agreeing to a pact of silence on details , it was unclear what points were discussed at a four-hour meeting on Tuesday ( corrects from Monday ) between government negotiator Domingo Palermo and guerrilla spokesman Rolly Rojas . 
a short statement issued by a &quot; guarantors &quot; commission overseeing the talks merely noted the beginning of &quot; preliminary conversations &quot; and said &quot; procedures &quot; had been agreed on for further negotiations &quot; at a date yet to be set . 
amid the welter of speculation surrounding the meeting , few political experts were betting on a sudden breakthrough in the search for a negotiated solution and the release of 72 hostages held for 57 days by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) rebels . 
&quot; It &apos;s always necessary to maintain a certain level of patience and prudence in these cases , &quot; Peru &apos;s civil rights ombudsman Jorge Santistevan said . 
that mood was echoed , more negatively , in the local news media . 
&quot; First dialogue with the MRTA ends in frustration , &quot; the opposition daily La Republica said on its front page , adding that the rebels &apos; &quot; intransigence &quot; had prevented real progress . 
&quot; It is evident that the first preliminary conversation ... was a failure , &quot; Manuel D &apos;Ornellas wrote in the pro-government Expreso . 
&quot; It was a dialogue between deaf people , but it did not end with a slammed door . 
for a minimal optimist , that is something . 
but those reactions may have overlooked the underlying significance of the long-waited meeting after weeks of mutual insults , intransigence and tense moments at the besieged Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence . 
it was the first time the sides had sat down together since an initial Dec . 28 meeting between Palermo and MRTA leader Nestor Cerpa Cartolini inside the residence . 
and they parted with at least a pledge to meet again . 
&quot; There is movement in the right direction . 
there is less public posturing by both sides . 
they are hunkering down at last , &quot; David Scott-Palmer , an author on Peru &apos;s guerrilla conflicts , said in a telephone conversation from Boston . 
he added that he believed the MRTA was privately moving away from its public position of refusing to drop its central demand for the release of some 400 jailed comrades . 
that position stalled efforts to relaunch talks in January . 
Ambassador Dennis Jett hailed the meeting as a &quot; very positive and necessary &quot; step forward and expressed his hope for a quick solution , local media said . 
the key players remained cautious . 
speaking before Tuesday &apos;s meeting , President Alberto Fujimori described it as a &quot; preliminary &quot; conversation intended to pave the way for &quot; definitive &quot; negotiations with Cerpa . 
and the MRTA leader specifically warned that the meeting might not bring a breakthrough . 
&quot; The beginning of talks does not necessarily mean the start of a solution to the conflict , &quot; he said via walkie-talkie from within the residence . 
analysts say a final solution may be reached , or at least rubber-stamped , between Fujimori and Cerpa themselves . 
Fujimori has repeatedly floated the possibility of granting the rebels asylum in a foreign country and was also believed to be considering granting an improvement in prison conditions in return for the release of the hostages . 
speaking in London , he said he detected &quot; elements that give us a certain optimism . 
&quot; He did not elaborate beyond saying that MRTA negotiator Rojas &quot; is a sociologist familiar with the theme and he could help us find a solution . 
Rojas , a 34-year-old former busfare collector who joined the MRTA while a university student , entered and left the talks at a nearby safe house via a Red Cross car without being seen or heard by the waiting hordes of journalists . 
people captured by the MRTA and then released near the start of the crisis described Rojas as affable , intelligent and open to dialogue .
