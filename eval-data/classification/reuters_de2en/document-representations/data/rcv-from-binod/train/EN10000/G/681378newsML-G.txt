a German court found two sons of jailed Algerian fundamentalist opposition leader Abassi Madani guilty on Monday of smuggling arms and explosives from Europe to anti-government forces in Algeria . 
Salim Abassi , 30 , and his brother Ikbal , 26 , were convicted of charges including explosives offences , belonging to a criminal organisation and forging documents . 
Salim was jailed for 32 months and Ikbal for 28 months . 
two other Algerians , Nasr-Eddine Layachi Hemaz , 31 , and Mahmoud Logbi , 26 , were also convicted . 
Hemaz was sentenced to 31 months in jail while Logbi received 10 months . 
the men , who all denied involvement , have been in custody for almost two years since German authorities cracked down on Algerian fundamentalists using south and west Germany as a base to support an armed conflict against Algeria &apos;s military rulers . 
they were found guilty after the 10 month trial of belonging to a gun-running group that worked independently but kept conspiratorial links with other Islamic fundamentalist groups in France , Italy , Belgium and Algeria . 
prosecutors said the group had shipped around 100 assault rifles , over 30 machine pistols , 20 repeating rifles , 15 hand guns , eight pump guns and assorted ammunition and explosives to Morocco and Algeria between March 1993 and April 1994 . 
prosecutors had asked the Duesseldorf court to give two years and eight months jail to Salim Abassi and two years four months to Ikbal . 
they had also asked for sentences of two years and seven months for Nasr-Eddine Layachi Hemaz and 11 months for Mahmoud Logbi facing the same charges . 
the Abassis &apos; father , Abassi Madani , is co-founder of the FIS , which took up arms against Algeria &apos;s military rulers after they intervened in 1992 to scrap a general election the FIS was set to win . 
Abassi Madani was sentenced to 12 years &apos; jail in 1991 in Algeria . 
he was put under house arrest in 1994 . 
his sons Ikbal , Salim and Oussama fled to Germany in 1992 and were been allowed to stay as political refugees .
