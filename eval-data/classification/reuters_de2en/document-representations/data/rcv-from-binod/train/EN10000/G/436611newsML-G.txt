by early next week nearly 500 rapists , murderers and kidnappers will have been released early from Florida prisons despite attempts to keep them behind bars , prison officials said Wednesday . 
although there is plenty of room in Florida &apos;s prisons , the violent offenders and hundreds of others are to be set free under incentives set up in the mid-1980s when state prisons were so overcrowded inmates served less than a third of their terms . 
the latest batch of releases began Tuesday with about 300 inmates set free from facilities across the state . 
another 200 were scheduled for release early next week . 
the state tried to keep the inmates jailed by ruling that a tougher law passed in 1995 could be applied to inmates sentenced before that but a series of court rulings halted the effort . 
&quot; These people would have been released already had it not been for the ( 1995 ruling ) , &quot; Laura Levings , spokeswoman for the Florida Department of corrections , said . 
&quot; They were held longer because of the rule . 
included among those released this week were scores of inmates convicted of first- and second-degree murder , aggravated assault and other violent offences . 
they benefitted from a recent Florida Supreme Court ruling that struck down attempts by state law enforcement officials to apply stiffer sentencing guidelines to criminals convicted before more stringent laws were enacted . 
the 1995 law required that inmates serve at least 85 percent of their sentences but it dealt only with those sentenced after it went into effect . 
Florida &apos;s attorney general last year gave correction officials authority to rescind the 1980s incentives for violent offenders convicted before the law went into effect . 
in April , the Department of corrections enacted a rule barring release for inmates sentenced for murder , sex crimes , assault and a host of other violent offences . 
the rule affected about 20,000 inmates . 
the state high court rejected the rule in October , saying the department could not apply it retroactively without violating the state constitution . 
the U.S. Supreme Court agreed . 
even without the more generous reduced sentences implemented in the late 1980s , most of the prisoners would have been released in the next few years . 
after next week &apos;s release of about 200 inmates , Levings said the department would be releasing nearly a dozen inmates a month who fall under the court &apos;s ruling .
