U.S. congressional chief Newt Gingrich met Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui on Wednesday , getting a red-carpet welcome after saying U.S. forces would defend the Nationalist-ruled island against attack by communist China . 
&quot; I &apos;m glad to be here , &quot; Gingrich told Lee as the men shook hands in Lee &apos;s office . 
the visit by Gingrich , the first House of Representatives speaker to come here since Washington switched diplomatic ties to Beijing in 1979 , put an intense spotlight on Taiwan-China frictions , seen by Beijing as a key irritant in Sino-U.S. ties . 
the state-run Central News Agency said Gingrich and Lee were expected to discuss the complicated relations between the United States , China and Taiwan during their closed-door talks . 
China , which had hosted Gingrich at the weekend , warned the United States on Tuesday not to interfere in Beijing &apos;s dealings with Taiwan , saying Washington should desist from large-scale high-technology weapons sales to Taipei . 
Gingrich &apos;s arrival brought the rare sight of a U.S.-flagged military plane emblazoned with &quot; United States of America &quot; landing at a Taipei military base , something that was common between 1949 and 1978 when Taiwan enjoyed close official ties . 
Gingrich shook hands warmly with Foreign Minister John Chang and leaders of Washington &apos;s de facto embassy , the private but government-funded American Institute in Taiwan . 
he made no comment to reporters but was expected to hold a news briefing after meeting Lee and lunching with Vice President LIEN Chan . 
his entire visit was to last just three hours . 
Chang hailed the visit as crucial for Taiwan &apos;s exiled Republic of China government , which has been trying to break out of a diplomatic isolation imposed by Beijing . 
&quot; This is an extremely significant affair , &quot; Chang told reporters at the airport just before Gingrich arrived . 
&quot; This shows that the Republic of China is an indispensable facet of the United States policy in Asia , &quot; he said . 
Taiwan and China split after a civil war ended in 1949 and the island has diplomatic ties with just 30 countries -- mostly underdeveloped states in Africa and Latin America . 
Gingrich said after his weekend Beijing visit that he had told China &apos;s communist leader that U.S. forces would defend Taiwan in the face of attack by Beijing -- something Washington has not explicitly promised to do . 
despite subsequent attempts by the White House to play down Gingrich &apos;s comments , Chang contended that the outspoken speaker &apos;s stance accorded with the official U.S. position . 
&quot; I think the positions of the U.S. legislative branch and the executive branch regarding policies toward Taiwan are the same , even if they choose to use different languages , &quot; Chang said . 
Beijing , which opposes contacts between Taiwan &apos;s leaders and U.S. officials , briefly downgraded its U.S. ties after President Lee was allowed to make a private U.S. visit in mid-1995 . 
China has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since a civil war split them in 1949 and vows to attack if it declares independence . 
it opposes U.S. arms sales to the island as interference in China &apos;s internal affairs . 
U.S. law authorises Washington to offer defensive arms to Taiwan but is ambiguous on whether the United States would come to the Nationalist-ruled island &apos;s defence .
