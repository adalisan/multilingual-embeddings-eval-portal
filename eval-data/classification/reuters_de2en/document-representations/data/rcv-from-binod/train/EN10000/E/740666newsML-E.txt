Thailand &apos;s finance minister assured Japanese business leaders on Friday that the economic turmoil in his country was temporary and would not affect companies in the middle to long term , a spokesman for the Keidanren business lobby said on Friday . 
the spokesman was speaking after Thai Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya and central bank governor Rerngchai Marakanond met with officials from the Japan Federation of Economic Organisations ( Keidanren ) . 
&quot; There was no discussion about the currency problem , &quot; the Keidanren official said . 
the Japanese business executives voiced concerns that the fall in the baht would raise costs for Japanese companies operating in Thailand and put pressure on their businesses , the spokesman said . 
the Thai minister told the executives that the impact from the recent de facto devaluation of the baht is temporary . 
in the mid to longer term the companies will be able to gain a competitive edge as exporters , Thanong was quoted as saying . 
Hiromichi Seya , the chairman of the Keidanren &apos;s Japan-Thailand Trade and Economic Committee , told the minister that Japanese companies intend to keep on trading with and investing in Thailand in the mid to long term , the spokesman said . 
both Thanong and Rerngchai told the business leaders not to worry as the Thai economy is stable . 
Thanong said in a speech that there was no truth in media reports painting a gloomy picture about Thailand &apos;s economic development . 
&quot; If you trust in these reports , Thailand will be in severe difficulty . 
there is no truth to these rumours . 
&quot; The Thai economy remains fundamentally sound . 
despite the the economic slowdown and less than robust outlook for growth , Thailand still adheres to a conservative fiscal and monetary stance , &quot; he said in his speech . 
Thanong said that after the problems in the financial system are resolved and an equilibrium is established in the exchange market , &quot; domestic interest rates , which were necessarily higher to deter speculative gains , will be lowered to an appropriate level , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The benefit to domestic and international investors in Thailand from the drop in interest rates will improve earnings outlooks , &quot; he added . 
&quot; The move to introduce a managed float regime , where the value will be determined by market forces , will enable the development process of Thailand to continue unimpeded by short-term speculative capital inflows , &quot; he said . 
Thanong also said that the outlook for the baht was one of equilibrium which supports export competitiveness and enhances the strong comparative advantage of investing in Thailand . 
he added that inflation this year after the managed float of the baht was expect to stand at a manageable level of about six percent . 
separately , another Keidanren spokeswoman said the Thai officials did not ask for new support from the Japanese companies . 
many Japanese banks are also members of the Japan-Thailand Trade and Economic Committee .
