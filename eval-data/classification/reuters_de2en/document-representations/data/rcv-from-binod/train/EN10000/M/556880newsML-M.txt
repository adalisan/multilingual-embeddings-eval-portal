Istanbul shares lost almost all of Thursday &apos;s gains in selling on Friday amid caution caused by ongoing political concerns ahead of the weekend , brokers said . 
the IMKB National-100 closed at 1,431 , down 38 points , or 2.59 percent from Thursday when it leapt 2.94 percent on easing political tension . 
but it rebounded from a late low of 1,422 . 
the index had dived 6.85 percent in the five days since the market opened last Thursday following a 6-1 / 2 day holiday . 
daily volume dropped to 10.67 trillion lira ( $ 78.8 million ) from 11.59 trillion ( $ 85.5 million ) on Thursday . 
&quot; Yesterday &apos;s sudden jump was an artificial move prompted by Ciller &apos;s remarks which caused political tension to ease . 
but the market is does not actually have the strength ( volume ) for an upward move , &quot; said Soner Canoglu from Yasar securities . 
the ruling Islamist Welfare Party ( RP ) won breathing space after deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said on Thursday her conservative True Path Party ( DYP ) would not abandon its coalition partners despite a row with the military over the rise of Islamist activity . 
brokers expect firm support at the index &apos;s 1,420 level to hold . 
&quot; shares will continue to move in narrow price ranges until there is a major increase in trade volume . 
the easing in political tension is not sufficient , &quot; said Haydar Haydaroglu from Halkbank . 
he said the market would also watch April inflation data to be released on Sunday and a possible Treasury bond auction for May 7 when the Treasury faces a 130 trillion lira bond redemption .
