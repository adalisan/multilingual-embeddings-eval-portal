UK financial markets were unfazed by the prospect of the first British Labour government in 18 years after a crushing defeat for the ruling Conservative Party at a regional election on Thursday . 
UK shares open little changed Friday and traders said subsequent losses owed more to jitters on Wall Street than Wirral , the northwest England district where the by-election took place . 
sterling recovered all modest overnight losses once London trading got underway and UK government bond prices slightly lower after opening unchanged . 
analysts said the by-election result , which showed a 17 percent voter swing to Labour , would ease nagging concerns about the accuracy of national opinion polls . 
these consistently show the opposition Labour Party about 20 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives , broadly in line with Thursday &apos;s outcome . 
a general election must be held by May 22 and the most likely date is widely seen as May 1 . 
&quot; The result plays down last-minute doubts about the accuracy of the opinion polls and it now looks more and more likely there will be a Labour government , &quot; said Joe Prendergast , foreign exchange strategist at U.S. investment firm Merrill Lynch . 
&quot; Given that this has been in the market for so long , the news is at worst sterling-neutral and in many ways positive . 
the worst-case scenario for most markets would be where the outcome of the general election showed no party with an overall majority , analysts said . 
this would paralyse economic policy . 
at 1300 GMT , the pound was trading at 2.7538 German marks , down slightly from 2.7470 late Thursday but up from the its overnight low at 2.7345 . 
against the dollar , it was little changed from Thursday &apos;s close at $ 1.6280 . 
the FTSE 100 share index of leading stocks was down 35 points at midday . 
future prices on 10-year government bonds for March delivery were down slightly to 113 from 113-07 at yesterday &apos;s close , while equivalent short-term interest rate futures were up . 
&quot; longer term , the market might be grateful for a decisive victory in the election , but that is not uppermost in its mind at the moment , &quot; said Philip Shaw , group economist at Union plc . 
the defeat at Wirral leaves the Conservatives with 322 parliamentary seats , one less than all the other parties combined . 
labour has called a confidence vote in the government but it is not expected to be able to rally all parties to force an immediate election . 
the 73 percent turnout at Wirral , meantime , was the second highest for any by-election in the past five years and is seen as another positive omen for Labour in the general election . 
&quot; The high turnover will definitely be something to chew over . 
it makes the Labour vote look less like a one-off protest . 
when voters want to do that they just stay at home rather than vote for the opposition , &quot; said one bond futures broker . 
bookmakers William Hill on Friday cut the odds on a Labour general election win to 2-9 from 1-4 . 
odds on the Conservatives retaining power were pushed out to 11-4 from 5-2. and a hung parliament where no party has a clear majority was rated a 3-1 chance . 
&quot; It was a complete and utter disaster for ( UK Prime Minister ) John Major ... he was slaughtered , &quot; said one head of equity sales here in London . 
&quot; Anyone thinking the Conservatives will make a surge from the back and get into power had better think again . 
the only real risk seen to established market views is that a Labour landslide in the general election may be so large that it allows the party leeway on its existing market-friendly monetary and fiscal policy commitments , said analysts . 
&quot; That is a risk scenario ... The option of a &apos; Canadian style wipe-out &apos; is still there , but it is not discounted , &quot; said Steve Hannah , head of research at Japanese bank IBJ International . 
&quot; Markets might feel uncomfortable with that . 
with a huge ( Labour ) majority , there is a risk that a party may engage in more radical policies , &quot; he said .
