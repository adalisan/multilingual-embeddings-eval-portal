the lawyer for the confessed assassin of civil rights leader Martin Luther King on Saturday said he is seeking a liver transplant for his client , James Earl Ray . 
in a special &quot; Larry King Live &quot; programme on CNN , PEPPER said Ray , 69 , was suffering from cirrhosis of the liver and needed a new liver . 
&quot; We are trying to get him on a list at one centre and we hope they &apos;ll accept him and we &apos;ll go forward with that , &quot; PEPPER said . 
ray , serving a 99-year prison sentence for the 1968 murder of King , is seeking to reopen the case and win a trial , but PEPPER said another strategy might be for the King family to seek appointment of a special prosecutor . 
ray initially confessed to the crime , but later recanted , saying his attorneys forced him to confess . 
ray , who is at Lois DeBerry Special Needs Facility in Nashville , Tenn . , is said to be near death after suffering near-fatal liver failure over the past three months , but he told interviewer Larry King on the same programme he was not dying . 
PEPPER said Ray was terminally ill but did not like to speak about it . 
in the hour-long programme , Ray denied stalking and shooting King . 
King &apos;s son , Dexter Scott King , met with Ray last month and said he believed him . 
ray &apos;s lawyer claims Ray was a &quot; Patsy &quot; in a broad conspiracy to have King killed , a job that was eventually carried out by a mafia-hired contract killer . 
ray portrayed himself as apolitical and not involved in any right-wing groups before the assassination of King . 
he said at the time he had escaped from a Missouri prison and was trying to stay out of jail and earn enough money to flee the country , in part by running guns for an arms smuggler named &quot; Raoul &quot; across the border to Mexico . 
civil rights leader Jesse Jackson , who was speaking with King just before he was shot , said he was not ready to exonerate Ray as the King family has done , but he believed others , including the U.S. government , were involved in the attack . 
he cited efforts by the FBI to destroy King &apos;s character and said the agency &apos;s investigation into his death was problematic since key people who were with King when he was killed were never interviewed by the FBI .
