the Russian Finance Ministry managed on Wednesday to keep a cap on yields of government paper at auctions , where a record high volume of 20 trillion roubles was offered , possibly with the help from Sberbank , dealers said . 
the annualised average yield of 364-day GKO discount Treasury bills was 20.65 percent and the average price of the 728-day OFZ interest-bearing bond was 97.30 percent at auctions on Wednesday . 
the Finance Ministry raised a total 5.52 trillion roubles from the auctions . 
before the auctions the Finance Ministry for the first time repaid on a voluntary basis 5.07 trillion roubles of the 24010 OFZ bond . 
it has also repaid 7.12 trillion roubles in a maturing T-bill and paid 1.25 trillion roubles in interest on the 24010 bond . 
after the auctions the Central Bank sold selected bonds in an effort to satisfy any possible demand after repayment . 
dealers said the results of the auctions depended on how much of the 24010 issue would be repaid , most of which was held by Sberbank , or , less probably , the Central Bank , traders said . 
they said after the first auction started there was a repayment of the 24010 issue , and judging by the size of the lot , it could have belonged to Sberbank , or possibly even the Central Bank . 
&quot; Maybe after everyone bid aggressively at the first auction , the Finance Ministry understood that it lacked money for refinancing , and the Central Bank repaid Sberbank two trillion roubles more , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; It means the Central Bank funded Sberbank to bid at an acceptable price . 
banks bid aggressively at the second auction too , and the Finance Ministry took a risk by refusing most of them , dealers said . 
&quot; It was a risky step , I think the Finance Ministry was not a hundred percent sure it would be able to get the money after the auctions , &quot; said Renaissance Capital dealer Alexei Orekhov . 
dealers said at the trading session after the auctions that most demand was from Sberbank , Russia &apos;s biggest bank . 
&quot; The Finance Ministry held the auctions from the position of power , &quot; Orekhov said . 
&quot; After such results it is obvious who dictates the market .
