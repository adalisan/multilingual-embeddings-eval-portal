Bangladesh on Tuesday proposed establishment of a committee to which U.N. secretaries-general could turn for advice . 
in a speech to the General Assembly , Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad said that while efforts were being made to make the Assembly , the Security Council and other parts of the U.N. system more effective , &quot; we could perhaps also ponder as to how the office of secretary-general could be bolstered . 
he proposed creation of a committee &quot; composed in the shape of the general committee of the General Assembly , which the secretary-general could consult , formally or informally , collectively or severally , on important administrative and political issues . 
the general , or steering , committee , which organises the Assembly &apos;s agenda , has 28 members -- the Assembly president , its 21 vice-presidents and the chairmen of its six main committees . 
such a committee would serve a particularly useful purpose &quot; in ensuring the rightful role of the General Assembly , &quot; Azad said , alluding to the diminished authority of that 185-nation body in recent years compared with the enhanced status of the 15-nation Security Council . 
in addition to ensuring closer interaction between the secretary-general and the Assembly , the proposed committee would provide the U.N. chief with &quot; the benefit of dispassionate counsel and a feel of the thinking of member states &quot; in an institutional manner , Azad said . 
it would also make for &quot; greater transparency in decision-making , &quot; he said , referring to openness in diplomacy . 
he said the secretary-general was &quot; the most visible symbol and personification &quot; of the United Nations system and &quot; something more than the chief administrative organisation , as stipulated in the U.N. Charter , because he also has important political responsibilities .
