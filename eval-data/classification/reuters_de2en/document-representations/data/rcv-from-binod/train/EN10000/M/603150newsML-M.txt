the Australian bond market &apos;s relief over an unchanged policy stance by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday proved short-lived as local wages growth by enterprise bargaining agreements remained high in the first quarter . 
the Department of Industrial Relations said that enterprise wage deals grew an average annualised 4.8 percent in the private sector and 4.7 percent in all sectors after having both risen 4.4 percent in the December quarter . 
talk that the report had been leaked before its official time had circulated the market around mid-morning , causing a jittery market to wipe out its early U.S.-led rally . 
industrial Relations Minister Peter Reith said today &apos;s data showed wage rises were too high for a low inflation environment , but added a clearer picture on economy-wide wage trends was likely on Thursday from final average weekly earnings data . 
the final data includes the public / private sector split and the market is looking for a private quarterly outcome of below 1.0 percent and 3.5 percent annually to keep alive vague hopes of a further monetary policy easing . 
the Federal Open Market Committee decision to leave policy unchanged lifted local prices in after hours trading with U.S. treasuries , but have subsequently been on the defensive . 
analysts said the FOMC &apos;s outcome still left the outlook for for U.S. unclear and a debate over a tightening at either the July or August meetings will continue to overhang U.S. debt . 
&quot; Like the rest of the market , the Fed appears to be confused by the persistent run of low inflation occuring at a time when labour market tightness and the acceleration in domestic demand would suggest otherwise , &quot; economists at Citibank Australia said . 
&quot; For the Fed , and probably the RBA , preemptive interest changes are unlikley in the near term . 
the central banks look like being reactive to events and the data flow - the economy is very hard to read , &quot; they said in a report . 
yield spreads widened against the U.S. in the run-up and after the local wages data . 
the largest move was against Canada , which rallied strongly in reaction to the unchanged Fed policy statement relieving pressure on the Canadian dollar .
