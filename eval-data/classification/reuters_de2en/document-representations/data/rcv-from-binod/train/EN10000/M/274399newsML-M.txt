Gulf bullion demand is expected to be robust going into 1997 because of a combination of falling prices , the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and Indian wedding season buying , Dubai gold traders said on Sunday . 
upbeat demand forecasts for the Gulf and India coupled with current low prices could emerge and reverse lacklustre retail bullion and jewellery turnover in recent weeks , they said . 
&quot; Many traders here are now pinning their hopes on Ramadan , &quot; said one wholesaler trader based in the Gulf Arab emirate . 
the end of fasting observed during Ramadan , which begins in the middle of January , traditionally marks an upturn in jewellery and gold purchases . 
&quot; Exports are increasing because of Ramadan . 
jewellers and wholesalers are building up stocks , &quot; said one Dubai-based trader who regularly supplies the Saudi Arabian market . 
&quot; Local demand is picking up very good and the market has improved a lot , &quot; he said , adding that demand in Saudi Arabia during Ramadan usually rose by 30-50 percent . 
Saudi gold dealers and merchants were reported on Sunday as saying that demand for bullion and finished products were up by as much as 25 percent in the oil-rich Eastern Province because of lower prices and expatriates &apos; seasonal holidays . 
demand in Saudi Arabia -- the Gulf &apos;s biggest consumer of the yellow metal -- reached 193.1 tonnes in 1995 of which 93.1 tonnes was imported mainly from Switzerland and Britain , according to World Gold Council figures . 
Indian bullion demand was steady though some Dubai traders said that wedding buying , despite a good harvest this year , was not yet a strong factor in the local Dubai market . 
&quot; The wedding season has not picked up much like in the past one or two years ... there is a lack of funds in the market because of economic uncertainty ( in India ) , &quot; a trader said . 
India &apos;s two marriage seasons -- the current one running from the end of November to February -- absorbs 300 tonnes of gold , making the country the world &apos;s largest consumer of the metal . 
Dubai is the country &apos;s main feeder market with some 80 percent of its imports ending up in the Indian subcontinent . 
&quot; More imports are expected if prices continue to rule low , &quot; Bombay Bullion Association president Makhan Lal Damani told Reuters in Bombay . 
Dubai &apos;s benchmark Ten Tola ( TT ) bar -- 3.746 ounces of 24 carat gold -- was quoted by Dubai traders on Sunday at 5,094 UAE dirhams ( $ 1,388.01 ) , down one dirham from December 15 and still close to three-year lows . 
re-exports to Pakistan from Dubai were also said stable despite an economic downturn and lower bullion demand . 
&quot; It &apos;s going well , legal imports are increasing , &quot; said the owner of one Dubai- based firm which has the license to export gold from the Gulf emirate to Pakistan , adding that his sales would reach some three tonnes in December .
