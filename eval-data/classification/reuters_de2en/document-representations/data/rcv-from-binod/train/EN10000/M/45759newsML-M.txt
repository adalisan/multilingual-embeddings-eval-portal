base metal prices gravitated towards the lower reaches of Wednesday &apos;s trading ranges during afternoon LME trading , as a depressed aluminium market pointed the way lower for the rest of the complex , traders said . 
aluminium hit a two year low of $ 1,437 a tonne and closed just above this level , with the market knocked by investment fund sales after expected consumer interest failed to emerge . 
inventories are increasing and consumers show little sign of buying anything more than hand-to-mouth requirements , which prompted stale bull liquidation today and suggests further losses are inevitable . 
&quot; People are talking about $ 1,425 , but there is little there to hold it , and if it breaks $ 1,400 then it could well go all the way back to $ 1,300 , &quot; one trader said . 
last three months business was at $ 1,438.50 , a $ 23.50 loss from Tuesday &apos;s kerb close . 
other metals saw early uptrends interrupted and then negated by aluminium &apos;s weakness , with copper similarly heading for a test of key levels on the downside , traders said . 
the market managed to bounce away from $ 1,905 today , but the modest mini-rally was unconvincing . 
&quot; The rallies are getting shorter and shorter , so at some stage it will get sold off . 
there are a lot of stops under there ( $ 1,900 ) , so we may get a sharp sell-off , &quot; another trader said . 
copper closed the kerb at $ 1,915 , down $ 9 from yesterday . 
the cash / threes spread was at a $ 12 / 16 backwardation . 
nickel prices remained softer during the afternoon rings and kerb , staging a downward reaction to early 2-1 / 2 month highs when prices were lifted by news of a furnace explosion at PT INCO in Indonesia . 
however , the rise proved vulnerable to profit-taking and technical selling , against a background of news that output and shipments from Norilsk were on track and downturns elsewhere . 
meanwhile , at INCO in Canada management made an offer to unionised workers at Manitoba on Tuesday , which the union responded to on Wednesday . 
the union is now waiting for INCO &apos;s reaction ahead of the September 15 contract expiry . 
three months closed at $ 7,630 / 40 a tonne , down $ 65 from Tuesday , and well below the $ 7,850 morning peak . 
zinc lurched lower throughout the session , initially losing grip on the $ 1,020 level , and then veering close to the $ 1,000 level this afternoon when sell-stops sent prices down to $ 1,006 . 
last trade was at $ 1,009 , a $ 13.50 loss , and given current negative sentiment the market is seen heading under $ 1,000 towards $ 980 . 
lead business was quiet , but the market similarly fell back , closing at $ 814 , down $ 3.50 . 
the tin market was shaken out of its recent neutral position in the mid- $ 6,200s , hitting a low of $ 6,190 before closing at $ 6,200 / 10 , against a previous $ 6,240 . 
Alloy moved lower with the depressed primary market and was $ 25 lower at $ 1,245 at the close .
