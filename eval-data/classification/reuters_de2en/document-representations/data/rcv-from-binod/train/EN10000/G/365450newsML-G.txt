the United States has sent a note to a number of governments denying Iranian &quot; disinformation &quot; that Tehran and Washington are holding secret talks , according to a source at the United Nations . 
a State Department official in Washington confirmed this to Reuters , saying , &quot; We are seeing some muddling of the state of U.S. relations out there and we are trying to set the story straight by saying what the real state of relations is . 
according to the source , the U.S. note said Washington had long been prepared to hold a dialogue with Iran , but on condition that it take place with an authorised representative of the Tehran government ; that the United States was able to raise all issues of concern ; and that , while the contents of the dialogue could remain secret , Washington would have to be able to acknowledge publicly that it was taking place . 
the Iranian government had never taken the United States up on its offer and no dialogue was now taking place . 
the U.S. note said Washington had learned that Iranian officials had made &quot; false statements &quot; to a number of governments about relations between the two countries . 
while the statements varied , a common theme was the claim of a secret dialogue . 
most of the statements had been accompanied by assurances that Iran was not involved in &quot; terrorist actions , &quot; such as last June &apos;s bombing of a U.S. installation in Saudi Arabia which killed 19 Americans . 
the United States and Iran have been at daggers drawn since the 1979 Islamic revolution which toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , a close U.S. ally . 
this was followed the same year by the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran and the holding of most of its staff hostage for 444 days . 
the U.S. note said that , in addition to the &quot; pattern of Iranian disinformation , &quot; there had been considerable unfounded press speculation in the United States and abroad about prospects for a review of U.S. policy toward Iran under the new Washington administration . 
but it said Iran &apos;s &quot; threatening behaviour &quot; had not changed and alleged that it continued to engage in and support terrorism , sought to derail the Middle East peace process , tried to destabilise regional governments and to &quot; pursue weapons of mass destruction . 
as long as Iran presented such serious threats to U.S. interests , the U.S. commitment to counter those threats would not change , it added . 
the State Department official declined to say which , or how many , countries had received the U.S. message . 
asked whether Washington was concerned European and other countries might pursue deals with Iran in the belief the United States had begun to break the ice with Tehran , he said : &quot; We specialise in preventive diplomacy . 
we want to make sure people understand what the situation is so we don &apos;t have to worry at some later time . 
he said he did not know whether any specific event prompted the U.S. action , but added : &quot; There were a number of indications that people were becoming somewhat confused about the real state of U.S.-Iranian relations .
