U.S. business leaders are intent on expanding their investments in South Africa and have encouraged the country to press ahead with its privatization efforts , said Thabo Mbeki , executive deputy president of South Africa , on Thursday . 
after meeting with some 200 U.S. executives here , Mbeki told reporters that business leaders expressed interest in the selloff of state enterprises as well as the government &apos;s incentives to spur job creation . 
&quot; Many U.S. corporations have raised the questions of accessing the South African markets , &quot; Mbeki said . 
&quot; They raise the question that the process of the privatization of state assets would be one of the quickest way by which they would effect this investment to South Africa , &quot; he added . 
Mbeki touted the Wednesday statement that U.S. investment bank JP Morgan would open an office in Johannesburg next year as a sign of increased U.S. investor interest . 
a U.S. energy company has discussed making a five billion rand investment in the South African economy , and a U.S. investment bank was gearing up for a multi-billion dollar commitment to the country , Mbeki also said . 
Mbeki , who is frequently cited as the heir apparent to President Nelson Mandela , downplayed financial market instability earlier this year when rumors swirled that the president was in poor health . 
&quot; There is no concern about this ( by U.S. investors ) , &quot; Mbeki said . 
&quot; There is not a single instance when people have said ( they ) are concerned about political stability . 
&quot; We are establishing a democratic system , with institutions , with processes , with a constitution , &quot; he added . 
&quot; It &apos;s not like you &apos;ve got a system whose survival and functioning depends on the will of a particular person . 
the recent instablity in the currency market that brought the rand to record lows also did not present worries for investors , Mbeki said . 
&quot; This particular issue has not been expressed by investors as a matter of great concern , where it would then lead people to say as a consequence we are not going to invest in South Africa , &quot; Mbeki said . 
the markets had expected a correction in the rand , which had previously been seen as overvalued , and could expect future fluctuations as in any floating currency regime , he said . 
&quot; Once you have an open economy , one must expect these movements of capital which impact on the relative values of currencies , &quot; he added .
