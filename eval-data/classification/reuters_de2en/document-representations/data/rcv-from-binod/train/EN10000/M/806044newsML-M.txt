U.S. debt futures finished a light session moderately higher , but off the day &apos;s peaks . 
September Treasury bond futures reached as high as 114-12 / 32 on the day , just shy of a key retracement level . 
technicians were eyeing 114-15 / 32 , the 50-percent retracement of the 116-31 / 32 to 111-31 / 32 break as an upside target . 
&quot; It looks pretty good on the charts , &quot; a T-bond futures trader said . 
he said the close above 113-30 / 32 keeps September neutral to bullish short term heading into Tuesday &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee meeting . 
September T-bonds closed up 15 / 32 to 114-3 / 32 in a 113-21 / 32 to 114-12 / 32 range . 
the T-bond trader cited a &quot; flight-to-quality type bid &quot; to debt futures as players early in the day worried about U.S. stock market viability . 
as stocks revived and posted strong gains in afternoon trade , debt futures slipped from their session peaks . 
but overall , traders said a firm technical tone sustained debt prices as the week began . 
one technician said he expected September T-bonds to find short-covering into Tuesday &apos;s monetary policy meeting . 
he pegged resistance above 114-15 / 32 at 115-6 / 32 . 
market consensus was for no change in official short-term interest rates as a result of Tuesday &apos;s FOMC meeting . 
September fed funds futures also reflected no anticipated change in the fed funds rate , traders said . 
traders said gains may have been limited during the day by one firm &apos;s sales of at least 4,000 September five-year note futures . 
but countering those sales were perceptions that the ongoing UPS strike could provide bullish momentum to debt futures , another trader said . 
&quot; UPS is becoming an issue in here as well , &quot; the trader said . 
&quot; I think a lot of people thought it would be over by now , &quot; he said . 
he said the strike could have market-friendly ramifications to U.S. economic reports . 
at the close , 10-year notes were up 10 / 32 point to 109-23 / 32 , December T-bills were up 0.25 point to 94.865 and December Eurodollars were 0.020 higher at 94.160 .
