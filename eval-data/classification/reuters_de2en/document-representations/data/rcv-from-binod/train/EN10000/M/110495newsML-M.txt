the Polish zloty is expected to retrack recent gains next week and gradually drift downward against the currency basket as currency inflows from privatisation deals end , dealers said on Friday . 
they said sell-offs done at the end of September fuelled the zloty &apos;s charge this week . 
it peaked early on Friday at 2.20 percent from the trading band centre -- the unit &apos;s highest level in three months . 
the zloty slipped slightly by Friday &apos;s close to about two percent from the centre of the 14-percent trading range , against last week &apos;s 1.80 percent from the parity rate . 
&quot; The zloty is likely to slowly sink toward 1.8 percent next week but no volatile drops are expected as trading volume is expected to stay light , &quot; said Przemyslaw Ciszecki , senior forex dealer at ING bank in Warsaw . 
analysts said the zloty would ease back into its weeks-long trading band between 1.9 and 1.6 percent as gloomy Polish current account balance expectations indicated that the currency should weaken over the next several months . 
&quot; Fundementals say the zloty should weaken and return to around 1.7 percent from parity , signalling that this week &apos;s uptrend was temporary , &quot; said Mateusz Bieniek , forex dealer at Societe Generale in Warsaw . 
analysts said thin trade on the forex market amplified the zloty &apos;s reactions to privatisation inflows , such as this week &apos;s $ 75 million sell-off of the Tyskie brewery . 
&quot; The zloty rise was accompanied by small turnover , which magnified movements coming from privatisation inflows , &quot; said Jaroslaw Dryjski , forex dealer at Bank Slaski SA . 
analysts said the zloty &apos;s rise was also propelled by banks cutting foreign currency positions and by foreign payments for Polish fixed bonds on October 7 and 14 . 
they said the zloty &apos;s relative strength should curb foreign investor entry at Monday &apos;s 1.2 billion zloty primary T-bill auction . 
&quot; Foreigners are not likely to bid at the tender with the zloty being so high , &quot; said Piotr Korcz of Bank Handlowy SA . 
&quot; yields are likely to hold basically flat on Monday , with corporate bids possibly pushing yields of shorter-paper down a fraction , &quot; Korcz added . 
on Monday the treasury will offer 600 million zlotys of 52-week bills , last yielding 19.43 percent , 150 million 26-week bills , last at 19.09 percent , 200 million 13-week bills , last at 18.55 , and 250 million of its 8-week paper , last at 18.11 . 
analysts said the treasury showed at this week &apos;s T-bill auction that it would not lower prices despite uninspiring food price data for September , which could keep the consumer price index from falling as deeply as the finance ministry forecast . 
the Central Statistical Office is due to release last month &apos;s CPI figures on October 15 . 
markets expect prices to increase by 1.4 percent after August &apos;s 0.5 percent rise , which took year-on-year growth up to 20.5 percent . 
the finance ministry and the central bank both said that year-on-year inflation should fall to 19 percent in September . 
on the money market one-day rates were seen stabilising next week just below the central bank &apos;s main 14-day drainage rate at 19.14 percent , analysts said . 
&quot; The situation stabilised , we will likely see quiet trade next week with one-day rates slightly below 19 percent , &quot; said Marek Golebiewski , chief dealer at PBK SA . 
overnight rates closed the week at around 18.50 percent and tomorrow / next rates at 18.65 percent .
