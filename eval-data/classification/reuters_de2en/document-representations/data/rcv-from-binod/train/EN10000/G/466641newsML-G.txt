Germany &apos;s anti-extremist watchdog said on Tuesday it feared violence next month when a Berlin court rules on gangland-style assassinations for which prosecutors blame Iran . 
the trial of five men for the 1992 murder of three Kurdish-Iranian opposition leaders and their translator has severely strained relations between Germany and Iran , which rejects prosecutors &apos; accusations of &quot; state terrorism &quot; . 
&quot; We must prepare ourselves for demonstrations , riots in Iran and considerable disturbance in foreign policy relations with Iran , &quot; Peter Frisch , head of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( BfV ) , told the Tageszeitung daily in an interview to be published on Wednesday . 
Frisch said security authorities were preparing for trouble and that he could not rule out the possibility of attacks in the country , although he said he did not think these would be initiated by Iran itself . 
the court is expected to announce a verdict on April 10 in the marathon trial of one Iranian and four Lebanese . 
last year protesters marched on the German embassy in Tehran , pelted it with eggs and tomatoes , and called for the death of state prosecutor Bruno Jost after he accused Iran of ordering the assassinations . 
German prosecutors have issued an arrest warrant for Tehran &apos;s Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahiyan in connection with the assassinations -- a move which also provoked fury in Iran against Germany , its biggest trading partner .
