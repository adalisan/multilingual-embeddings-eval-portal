South African environmental activists on Wednesday marched on the French and Japanese embassies to protest against a British ship carrying nuclear waste , due to round the Cape coast this week . 
the Pacific Teal is en route to Japan from France , where the 14 tonnes of toxic waste on board were reprocessed . 
the South African environment ministry has repeatedly said the ship would not come closer than 120 miles to the South African coast and that extensive safety measures were in place for any eventuality . 
but the nearly 100 protesters , dressed in colourful costumes and chanting anti-nuclear slogans as they jammed Cape Town city &apos;s traffic for about two hours , were not persuaded . 
and newspaper reports on cyclone Gretelle , which is near to the east coast of South Africa , did not help . 
&quot; The probability of something happening to the ship is low , but that doesn &apos;t mean something would not happen , &quot; environmentalist heather Shearer told Reuters . 
&quot; We want the government to ban this ship from sailing near South African waters . 
if it is so safe why then are other governments so anti it ? 
&quot; she queried . 
the environmental group Greenpeace has predicted that the ship could pass Cape Town on Saturday . 
but the exact timetable of the passage of the Pacific Teal from Europe to Japan has been kept a closely guarded secret by Japan , Britain and France . 
earlier reports said the ship , which left France last week , was due to reach Japan by mid-March after sailing via the Cape and New Zealand .
