most Australian small businesses believe the economy is either standing still or in recession , but the minority of businesses expecting a pick-up has risen , according to a survey released on Wednesday . 
the survey , conducted by Telstra Corp &apos;s half-owned telephone directory subsidiary Yellow Pages Australia , showed 62 percent of small business operators believe the economy has stalled and 18 percent believe it is in recession . 
the random survey of 1,200 small businesses across Australia was conducted from October 23 to November 6 and covered their experience over the October quarter and their expectations for the 12 months ending November 1997 , Yellow Pages said . 
the proportion of small businesses expecting an economic pick-up over the next 12 months rose to 35 percent from 25 percent in the August survey , it said . 
the latest survey just coincided with the Reserve Bank &apos;s move on November 6 to cut the official cash interest rate by 50 basis points to 6.5 percent . 
the followed a similar easing in late July . 
&quot; The previous half-a-percent rate cut ( on July 31 ) did nothing to lift the performance or confidence of the small business sector . 
one would hope that the latest cut will have a real impact , &quot; said Yellow Page &apos;s economic adviser , John Marsden , in a statement .
