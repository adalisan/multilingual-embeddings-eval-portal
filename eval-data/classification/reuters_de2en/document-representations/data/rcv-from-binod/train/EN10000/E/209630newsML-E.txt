Russia will collect only 85 percent of taxes budgeted this year , although revenues are improving as the year closes , a state tax service official said on Friday . 
by December the amount of tax collected could be 85 percent of budgeted levels , although in the first 10 months of this year year it was only 75 percent , Andrei Ilyin , head of the information monitoring department told a news conference . 
&quot; Under the circumstances , we can realistically count only on 85 percent , &quot; he said . 
tax collection in the first 14 days of November was 12 percent more than budgeted for the month , or 8.8 trillion roubles , Vladimir Yevstigneyev deputy service head said . 
but in August and September the state coffers received almost no taxes , causing the International Monetary Fund to delay paying the October tranche of its $ 10 billion loan to Russia . 
an IMF mission is now in Moscow to assess whether the money can be paid out and Economy Minister Yevgeny Yasin said on Thursday the talks were difficult . 
Yevstigneyev attiributed bad tax collection to falling industrial production and the poor state of many banks . 
he said the number of loss-making enterprises rose to 43 percent of the total number of companies in the first 10 months of the year from 40 percent in the first nine months . 
&quot; The rate of growth in loss-making firms continues to worry us , &quot; he said . 
Yevstigneyev cited central bank data saying three trillion roubles were frozen on troubled banks &apos; accounts . 
the oil and gas sector is the biggest debtor to the state with 73 companies owing over 100 billion roubles , deputy head Vladimir Popov said . 
among the biggest debtors in the group he mentioned carmaker AvtoVAZ AVST.RGS with 2.8 trillion roubles , and three large oil companies -- Yuganskneftegaz YFGA.RTS with two trillion roubles , Nizhnevartovskneftegaz NZGZ.RTS with 1.4 trillion roubles and Noyabrskneftegaz NYGS.RTS with 1.2 trillion roubles in debt . 
but while the oil and gas sector owed 19 trillion roubles to the state , the state owed the industry 30.7 trillion roubles , Popov said . 
Russia is crippled by a non-payment crisis in which companies and the state owe each other trillions of roubles but are unable or unwilling to pay the bills . 
Yevstigneyev said non-payments amounted to 427 trillion roubles at the start of September . 
wage arrears amounted to 43 trillion roubles on October 28 , he said . 
Popov said that only 16.6 percent of all tax-payers made their payments regularly .
