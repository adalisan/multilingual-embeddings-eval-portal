a lack of demand subdued trading in German spot and new crop wheat and prices were easing in both delivered and export markets , brokers said . 
End-of-season old crop sales were being carried out slowly and millers and compound feed producers , who appeared adequately covered ahead of the new crop , had stopped ordering . 
southern European consumers logged some new crop inquiries but did not fix prices . 
they expected prices to drift in the coming weeks against the background of favourable European grain crop weather . 
but harvest delays , should the summer be rainy , could underpin levels , sellers at farm and co-op level pointed out . 
feed wheat markets came under renewed pressure from British offers . 
the Hamburg grain exchange cut its spot bread wheat price ( 12.5 percent protein , 220 hagberg ) by five marks / tonne on the week to 277.50 marks and the feed wheat price was also off five at 275 marks . 
fob Baltic sellers cut nominal June delivery wheat by between 1.50 and 5.00 marks on the week . 
they quoted 12 percent protein wheat at 275-295 marks and material with 13 / 14 percent protein at 282.50-322.50 marks . 
fob Baltic barley offers were unchanged at 272.50 marks , off 1.00 . 
rye was down by up to 2.50 marks at 265-267.50 .

fob Baltic September wheat with 12 percent protein , at 272.50 marks , was offered below comparable old crop wheat for the first time this season . 
new crop rye indications remained at around 265 marks and barley was set at 242.50-257.50 , depending on port and shipment date .
