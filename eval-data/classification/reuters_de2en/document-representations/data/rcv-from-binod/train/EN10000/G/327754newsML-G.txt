Russia &apos;s upper house of parliament urged President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday to sack a senior aide , stepping up pressure on the Kremlin leader as he recovers from pneumonia . 
one day after the lower house debated removing Yeltsin for health reasons , the Federation Council launched a fierce attack on Boris Berezovsky , deputy secretary of Yeltsin &apos;s influential Security Council . 
the upper chamber said Berezovsky , a controversial businessman promoted to the Kremlin last October , had overstepped his authority by backing demands by Cossacks in southern Russia to be allowed to carry arms in self defence . 
&quot; Members of the Federation Council express their no-confidence in him and recommend the president ... immediately relieve him of his duties , &quot; said a non-binding resolution passed by 103 votes to three against . 
aides say Yeltsin , who turns 66 next week , visited the Kremlin on Wednesday for the first time since he was taken to hospital on January 8 . 
the presidential press service said he was working on documents at a country residence on Thursday . 
Russian television showed pictures -- from a distance -- of a black limousine pulling up outside the main Kremlin building on Wednesday but , in contrast to the practice after previous illnesses , did not show Yeltsin himself . 
Yeltsin spent most of the second half of 1996 getting ready for heart surgery and then recovering from a bypass operation . 
his doctors say he will need two or three weeks to recover from his latest illness and they have warned him not to rush his recovery , although Chernomydin said on Thursday he expected Yeltsin to return to the Kremlin in the next few days . 
Yeltsin &apos;s political foes say he is not well enough to rule the vast country . 
the State Duma , the lower house of parliament , debated a resolution on Wednesday on ousting him for health reasons and is expected to resume the debate next month . 
deputies in the Duma , which is dominated by communists and their conservative allies , have also attacked Yeltsin &apos;s unpopular chief of staff , Anatoly Chubais , and demanded he be investigated for alleged evasion of taxes . 
Chubais , who as architect of Yeltsin &apos;s free market reforms and privatisation has long been a target for the communists , has denied the accusations . 
Yeltsin &apos;s absences , criticism of his aides and parliament &apos;s attempts to censure him have increased the impression of a rudderless country and boosted speculation that Yeltsin might not see out his four-year term in office . 
&quot; It seems nobody has reliable information about the president &apos;s condition and the extent of his work capacity today , &quot; said the liberal newspaper Sevodnya . 
Yeltsin was elected last July for a second term which is due ot end in the year 2000 . 
if an election were held early , candidates would probably include one-time security chief Alexander Lebed , Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov , ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky and Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov . 
many political analysts say Lebed would be the most likely victor if the election were held soon .
