the Kaohsiung division of Taiwan &apos;s breakfast soybean Procurement Association bought two 54,000-tonne shipments of U.S. soybeans from Continental at an unusual invitation-only tender on Friday , traders said . 
the tender terms had specified one 54,000-tonne shipment with two shipping date options , but the soybean association ended up buying one shipment for each date due to the attractive terms , traders said . 
specific prices were unavailable . 
the BSPA group and officials of U.S. supplier Continental declined to disclose purchase prices , a departure from Taiwan &apos;s normal tendering process . 
traders estimated that the first shipment was at 130 U.S. cents level over Chicago November futures and second at 140 U.S. cents level over Chicago November . 
details for the tender are as follows : 
shipment tonnes date / location 
54,000 Sep 20-Oct 4 Oct 5-Oct 20 
U.S. Gulf Pacific N.W. 
54,000 Oct 1-15 Oct 16-30 
because prices were not disclosed , it was not immediately known whether the unexpectedly large purchase would lure rival buyers into the market -- particularly the unaffiliated Taichung division of the breakfast soybean Procurement Association . 
&quot; It &apos;s a new strategy and it &apos;s still an open question whether it will work , &quot; said one trader , expressing a widely held view . 
traders said the Kaohsiung group had changed its normal open public tender to secretive invitation-only procedure mainly to keep the arch rival Taichung group from learning its details . 
Taichung group officials were unavailable for comment . 
&quot; The Kaohsiung division has maintained a high level of secrecy on the tender , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; Only a handful of suppliers were invited . 
the Taichung division comprises Sino Japan Feed Corp , Chia Hsin , Formosa oilseed , Fwu sow grain and Tay Shan .
