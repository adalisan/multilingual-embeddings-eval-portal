Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd . , builder of the Candu reactor used in Argentina , South Korea , Romania and Canada , moved on Thursday to limit damage from a devastating report on Ontario &apos;s once-vaunted nuclear plants . 
Ontario government-owned Ontario hydro , North America &apos;s largest power utility , unveiled on Wednesday a multi-billion dollar overhaul of its troubled nuclear power operations , including a shutdown of seven Candu nuclear units . 
the overhaul is expected to cost up to C $ 8 billion ( $ 5.7 billion ) over the next five years , starting this year . 
AECL , owned by the federal government , is the designer and builder of the nine Candu reactors now in operation or under construction in Romania , Argentina , South Korea , and China . 
in Canada , 22 Candu reactors are in use in Ontario , Quebec and New Brunswick . 
&quot; The reports out of Ontario hydro are certainly not welcome news . 
troubles in any nuclear utility are unwelcome news for the nuclear business in general , &quot; Gary Kugler , AECL vice-president of commercial operations , said in a telephone interview on Thursday . 
he said AECL representatives were already in contact with customers in Argentina , China , South Korea and Turkey . 
&quot; We &apos;re going to explain to our clients and prospective clients that we continue to be confident of Candu technology , &quot; Kugler said . 
the shakeup followed a scathing report that said the nuclear division suffered from a &quot; lack of authoritative and accountable managerial leadership &quot; and concluded the performance of the five nuclear plants was &quot; minimally acceptable &quot; for a North American nuclear operation . 
but it said the Candu reactor was a &quot; robust &quot; design and plant hardware was &quot; adequately reliable . 
&quot; There is no question we have our work cut out for us to explain this to our offshore customers . 
when you buy a nuclear reactor you &apos;re buying a 40 or 50-year marriage , &quot; said Murray Stewart , president of the Canadian Nuclear Association , a group representing reactor makers , uranium producers , utilities and government . 
Kugler said he expected competitors to take advantage of Ontario hydro &apos;s nuclear woes in the bidding for overseas contracts . 
AECL is bidding for a contract in Turkey and additional deals in Romania and South Korea . 
it also is eying Asia for possible sales . 
last fall , Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien signed a C $ 4 billion ( $ 2.9 billion ) deal during a trade mission to China . 
the sale was criticized by environmentalists because it was not subject to an environmental assessment despite C $ 1.5 billion ( $ 1.1 billion ) in Canadian financing . 
after Wednesday &apos;s report , some environmental groups demanded that nuclear power be phased out in Canada . 
aside from concern over disposing of nuclear waste and radioactive containment leaks , the groups said the cost had been too high .
