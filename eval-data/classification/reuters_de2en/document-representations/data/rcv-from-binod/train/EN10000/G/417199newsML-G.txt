President Idriss Deby &apos;s party accused Chad &apos;s independent electoral commission on Tuesday of foul play after it published results showing him falling short of an outright majority in parliamentary elections . 
provisional results of February run-offs , issued by the Independent National Electoral Commission late on Monday , showed Deby &apos;s Patriotic Salvation Movement ( MPS ) with 55 of the new national assembly &apos;s 125 seats . 
but his party said in a statement that by its calculations it had won 65 seats and it asked the appeal court , which has yet to publish final results , to rule on the matter . 
&quot; These results have been scandalously manipulated by the independent national electoral commission , &quot; it said , expressing its &quot; stupefaction &quot; . 
Deby , a former guerrilla leader from the Moslem north , seized power in a 1990 French-backed coup after decades of civil war or conflict with Libya . 
after repeated electoral delays , he won a multi-party presidential election in July . 
Monday &apos;s results showed the Moslem north and Christian south voting along regional lines during the two rounds of the parliamentary poll in January and February . 
Deby &apos;s southern rival General Wadal Abdelkader Kamougue , the runner-up in July , and his Union for Renewal and Democracy ( URD ) , won 31 seats , according to the provisional results . 
foreign Minister Saleh Kebzabo and his National Union for Development and Renewal ( UNDR ) won 15 . 
the appeal court is expected to take several days to sift through complaints from candidates . 
UNDR sources say they signed an accord with Deby &apos;s party between the two rounds of voting on forming a majority . 
&quot; If the agreement is respected then the two parties will have a majority of 70 seats in the national assembly , &quot; one said . 
Chad , a sprawling former French colony on the fringes of the Sahara desert , previously had a 57-member interim assembly under a 1993 transitional charter .
