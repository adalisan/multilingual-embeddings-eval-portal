investor confidence in Poland &apos;s long-term economic prospects is likely to keep investment booming , Finance Minister Marek Belka said on Wednesday . 
Belka told a news conference that while Poland is striving to cool internal demand to get its trade deficit under control , investment growth , this year expected at above 20 percent in real terms , might prove unstoppable . 
&quot; We believe that nothing can halt this investment boom unless we tried to make extra drastic steps which will not be needed , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Investments are gaining pace especially in the private sector and in infrastructure , &quot; he added . 
Belka said that because investment was creating demand for imports and adding to the pressure on Poland &apos;s trade balance , expected to show a deficit of $ 12 billion this year , the government would seek to limit domestic consumption to control demand . 
&quot; As we assume that it is impossible to slow-down investment growth we have to assume that domestic consumption will grow slower , &quot; he said .
