shares on Jordan &apos;s stock exchange fell close to 1997 lows on Sunday after a raft of disappointing annual results from smaller firms , brokers said . 
the official Amman Financial Market ( AFM ) index fell 0.46 percent to 152.12 points after shares worth 660,000 dinars ( $ 519,000 ) changed hands . 
the index started 1997 at 151.61 points but rose to over 157 before falling back . 
&quot; Overall sentiment is poor , &quot; said one broker . 
analyst Mohammad Abdallah said poor results from Industrial Commercial and Agriculture , Universal Modern Industry , Jordan Rockwool Industries and Jordan Worsted Mills prompted the mood of pessimism . 
he said Industrial Commerical Agriculture announced 1996 losses of 315,000 dinars , compared to 1995 profit of 397,000 dinars . 
its stock fell by the daily maximum of five percent to 2.22 dinars . 
vegetable oil producer Universal Modern Industry , hit by Jordan &apos;s lower trade protocol with sanction-hit Iraq last year , announced a slump in profits to 15,000 dinars from over two million dinars in 1995 , Abdallah said . 
the shares also fell five percent on Sunday to 1.50 dinars . 
both companies were expected to do better in 1997 after Iraq and the U.N. agreed an accord under which Iraq can sell oil worth $ 2 million over six months to pay for urgently needed food and medicine . 
a fall in profit to 2.5 million dinars from 3.2 million in 1995 reported by Jordan Worsted Mills and a 1996 loss of 113,000 dinars by Jordan Rockwool Industries also depressed the bourse , Abdallah said . 
overall 20 shares fell , led by heavyweight Arab Bank , which lost one dinar to 253 dinars in trade worth 91,000 dinars . 
brokers said the bank , which announced on Friday a 17.7 percent rise in 1996 net profits but declined to set a date for a planned bonus share offer , fell victim to the overall negative sentiment on the bourse . 
shares in just seven companies rose , but they were barely traded . 
shares in another 13 companies were traded but closed unchanged . 
the private Pearl Index of the 45 most-traded shares on the exchange shed 0.33 percent to 79.77 points , 4.35 percent down from the start of the year .
