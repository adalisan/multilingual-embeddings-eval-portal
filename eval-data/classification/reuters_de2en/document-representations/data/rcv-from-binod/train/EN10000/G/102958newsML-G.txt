Filippus Hannesson , almost 100 years old , sits on his farm high above the main road watching jeeps ferry scientists and journalists across the black sand plain below Vatnajokul , Europe &apos;s largest glacier . 
the visitors are anxiously waiting for a huge ice dam in the glacier to give way , releasing a torrent of water and ice which they believe will flood the southeast coast of Iceland . 
the countdown began a week ago when a volcano under the glacier began to erupt , causing parts of the ice cap to melt . 
the meltwater has filled the Grimsvotn subglacial lake to brimming , and scientists say it is only a matter of time before the glacier bursts under the pressure . 
the slightly-built farmer has one thing the scientists don &apos;t -- the experience of age . 
he can remember the last major flood from the Grimsvotn lake in 1938 , when the waters reached right up to the perimeter of his farm . 
&quot; It &apos;s drawing closer , the glacier is obviously rising , but it &apos;s impossible to say when it will flood . 
it could be days , weeks or months , &quot; Hannesson told Reuters on Tuesday . 
his sheep farm Nupsstadur is the closest to the top of the Vatnajokul glacier , in the shadow of Mount Eystrafjall . 
the farmhouse stands with a tiny , ancient chapel , one of the few grass-roofed churches remaining in Iceland . 
both are listed as important historical sites . 
Hannesson lives with his 89 year-old brother Eyolfur , and the two can trace their family &apos;s presence on the farm back to the eighteenth century . 
in 1938 his father , a postman , was crossing the glacier from Skaftafell when the torrent broke loose . 
&quot; He heard loud sucking sounds and cracking . 
he said it was like a giant woman in labour , groaning and moaning , &quot; Hannesson laughed . 
the floods brought ice blocks as large as houses crashing down onto the plain , crushing telephone poles and severing communications between the east and the west of the island . 
Hannesson and his nine brothers and sisters rushed to save their flock at the risk of being sucked into the quagmire themselves . 
&quot; We had to keep moving all the time , or we would have got stuck fast . 
luckily , none of the sheep were killed , &quot; he recalled . 
Hannesson -- who looks not a day over 70 -- and his brother tend the farm themselves , getting around in a 1954 yellow and red army jeep . 
their only other concessions to the 20th century are a tractor and a television set . 
amid all the tension of the past week , Hannesson remains calm . 
the flood won &apos;t come here , &quot; he said . 
all was quiet beneath the massive and desolate glacier on Tuesday , but water levels under the ice are rising by 10 metres ( 33 feet ) per day . 
teams of engineers are on 24-hour alert to save roads , bridges and power lines when the floods break , and rescue teams are on hand . 
seismologists and journalists are waiting to record a spectacle which only a few locals have ever seen , 58 years ago .
