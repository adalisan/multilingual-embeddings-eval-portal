South Africa &apos;a ruling African National Congress scored a propaganda coup on Thursday in its fight to weaken a political rival when a senior hardliner from the Zulu-based Inkatha defected to its ranks . 
Walter Felgate , a &quot; white Zulu &quot; who for years was the right- hand man of Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi , stunned the country by announcing he had joined the ANC . 
&quot; I want to be part of the new South Africa , I want to know what it is like to be free , &quot; he told a news conference in Durban , sporting an ANC baseball cap and waving his new party card around . 
Felgate said disagreement with Buthelezi -- President Nelson Mandela &apos;s strongest black rival despite being interior minister in the national unity government -- and a lack of democracy in his Inkatha Freedom Party had led him to quit . 
Felgate was instrumental in advising Buthelezi in South Africa &apos;s crucial transition negotiations , after ANC figurehead Nelson Mandela was freed from prison in 1990 and up to the historic all-race elections in 1994 . 
it included an IFP boycott of the election process , until a week before the April poll , which almost wrecked the final stage of the transition from apartheid and white minority rule . 
the IFP won control of its stronghold , KwaZulu-Natal province , in the election . 
but it has failed to extend its support nationally and is now losing support in the province and facing financial trouble ahead of the 1999 elections . 
Felgate said Inkatha &apos;s continual resort to confrontational politics had proved too much for him . 
&quot; The lack of democracy inside the IFP , the decisions that are forced on the IFP by the chief ( Buthelezi ) ... make it extremely difficult to work from within the IFP , &quot; he said . 
Felgate &apos;s influence had waned since the 1994 elections , which won him a seat in parliament he later gave up in favour of a place in the KwaZulu-Natal provincial legislature . 
an Inkatha source told Reuters Felgate had been on his way out of IFP politics anyway due to ill-health . 
Party officials were scathing of his defection to the party he spent most of his recent political life condemning . 
&quot; Felgate is only living up to his traditional Zulu name -- which means the follower of any dripping honeypot , &quot; Philip Powell , another IFP hardliner , told national radio . 
a senior ANC source said the defection might prove more of an embarrassment than an asset because Felgate had largely been discredited over the past few years . 
&quot; Frankly , we would have been more interested if one of the Zulu-speaking members had crossed over than their unwanted white members who won &apos;t bring any support with them , &quot; the source said . 
Felgate said the final straw had been Inkatha &apos;s decision to withdraw last week from peace talks with the ANC because of allegations made against Inkatha at a truth commission hearing . 
three Zulus , among 200 Inkatha men given military training by the apartheid state , told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that Buthelezi had known of senior Inkatha leaders &apos; orders that the trainees be used to kill ANC supporters . 
&quot; When I saw the peace process thrown out the cot by the chief along with everything else when the truth commission made certain revelations it was just too much , &quot; Felgate said .
