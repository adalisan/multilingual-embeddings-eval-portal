Vietnam said on Thursday it had refused to renew a visa for an American correspondent in Hanoi , adding that it welcomed journalists who operate with goodwill and within the law . 
a short statement issued by the Foreign Ministry said Hanoi had been unable to renew a visa for journalist Adam Schwarz , 35 , of the Far Eastern Economic Review magazine . 
&quot; We find it impossible to extend it . 
it &apos;s a normal thing , &quot; the statement said , adding : 
&quot; We &apos;d like to take this opportunity to reconfirm that Vietnam &apos;s policy is always to welcome and create favourable conditions for foreign correspondents to come and carry out press activities in Vietnam within the Vietnamese legal framework and current regulations and with goodwill towards contributing to mutual understanding between nations . 
Vietnam opened its doors to foreign correspondents in the late 1980s . 
since then a number of international news organisations have set up bureaux in the capital , Hanoi , to report on a country going through a process of reform and economic awakening . 
but relations between the government and the foreign media have remained delicate . 
Hanoi has been critical this year of news organisations that have reported indications of a downturn in the investment environment or strayed into sensitive political territory , such as details of the inner workings of the Communist Party . 
the decision to refuse Schwarz a visa marks the first time a resident correspondent has been formally compelled to leave since reform policies were launched in 1986 . 
far Eastern Economic Review editor Joseph Kahn said on Thursday he was disappointed by the decision . 
&quot; We are happy with Adam &apos;s coverage , &quot; he said by phone from Hong Kong . 
&quot; But the Vietnamese had another impression , and it &apos;s clearly their country . 
Kahn added that the Review , a Hong Kong-based subsidiary of U.S. firm Dow Jones and Company Inc , was planning to post another correspondent to Hanoi in the near future . 
Schwarz began his assignment in Vietnam in 1994 . 
the Review first opened its Hanoi office in 1990 .
