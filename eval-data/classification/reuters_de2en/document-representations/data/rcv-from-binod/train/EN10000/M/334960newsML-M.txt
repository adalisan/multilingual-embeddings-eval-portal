distant December and February posted new contract highs . 
feeder cattle ended 0.025 lower to 1.400 higher with only January off and March up 0.725 at 69.250 cents . 
may through November posted new contract highs with October and November briefly limit up late . 
late fund buying added to early strength in live cattle from Friday &apos;s bullish USDA Cattle-on-Feed report , they said . 
the report put December major seven-state feedlot placements at 98 percent of last year , well under the average trade expectation of 108.2 percent . 
commercial selling weighed on the market after the initial jump reflecting the continued larger-than-year-ago number of cattle on feed , but pressure lacked follow through which sparked late fund buying , they said . 
&quot; The underlying factor is that the market closed about the way the report led you to believe , &quot; said Don Roose , President U.S. commodities Inc . 
bear spreading and funds rolling out of long February positions kept February from rallying further . 
the report showed that April and June would pace any gains and spreaders would in turn sell February , traders said . 
buy stops were hit in both months , pit sources said . 
in live cattle options , commercials sold February 64 calls on the rally in futures while hedging in April and June , buying puts and selling calls , pit sources said . 
feeders rallied again late paced by back months which set new contract highs . 
early expectations of reduced feeder numbers in the upcoming quarterly U.S. cattle inventory report added to strength , traders said . 
&quot; After last year , ( losses in cow operations ) there is a feeling that we liquidated some cows , &quot; Roose said . 
man , RBH and Cargill bought back months on the rally and Refco , ADM investor Services and locals bought March , pit sources said .
