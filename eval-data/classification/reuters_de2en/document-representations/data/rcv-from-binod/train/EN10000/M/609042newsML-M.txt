Singapore prompt gas oil price pierced its long-term support of $ 25 when it traded thrice at $ 24.90 a barrel on Friday , the first time since last August , and is set for a free-fall amid weak regional demand , traders said . 
traders said they now see support at $ 24.50 per barrel , which augured badly for refiners &apos; profit margins and might force them to cut crude runs soon if the fall continued next week . 
three physical cargoes were traded at $ 24.90--a Swiss trader to a Japanese trader for June 7-11 , a Mediterranean trader to a Singapore trader and a European major to a Japanese trader for June 18-22 liftings , free-on-board ( fob ) basis . 
the European major sold two other cargoes earlier to the Japanese trader at $ 25.00 for June 7-11 and June 18-22 liftings fob . 
the soft undertone was also seen on the swaps market with June traded as low as $ 24.85 . 
traders said in its July tender which closes on May 27 , Indian Oil Corp is expected to buys about 360,000 tonnes of 1.0-percent sulphur gas oil , and 180,000 tonnes each of the 0.5 and 0.25 percent sulphur grades . 
India bought only 270,000 tonnes of 1.0-percent sulphur gas oil and 45,000 tonnes of the 0.25-percent sulphur grade . 
but traders said despite the relatively higher volumes expected for July , it was still not large enough to resuscitate the weak market . 
traders said Abu Dhabi National Oil Co &apos;s tender to sell 75,000 tonnes of 0.5-percent sulphur gas oil for June 22-24 lifting was awarded to Malaysia &apos;s Petco at a 30-cent-per-barrel premium , fob Ruwais . 
traders had earlier said that the awarded price was a 35-cent premium . 
Sri Lanka has issued a tender to buy 220,000 barrels of gas oil and 80,000 barrels of jet fuel for June 10-11 delivery , which closes on May 28 . 
Singapore physical jet fuel was steady with a 130,000-barrel cargo sold by a European major to a US trader at $ 24.40 per barrel for June 17-21 lifting fob Singapore . 
Taiwan bought 32,000 tonnes of jet fuel at around $ 201 per tonne for July delivery , c-and-f basis from a Singapore trader . 
this was lower than the last cargoes CPC bought for May delivery at $ 204 per tonne . 
traders said jet fuel market was well supplied as seen in 
the more than 15 offers made into Taiwan &apos;s tender .
