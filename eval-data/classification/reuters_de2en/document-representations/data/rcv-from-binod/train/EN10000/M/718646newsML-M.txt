IPE August gas oil futures closed $ 1.50 down at $ 161.75 a tonneon Thursday , continuing a trend of recent sluggishness . 
traders said August gas oil slipped further in the afternoon as Brent crude fell on news that Germany plans to sell part of its strategic oil reserves in 1997 and 1998 . 
&quot; The Germany news put pressure there but it ( gas oil ) was already on a bearish track , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; Generally speaking gas oil has been much less inclined to move upwards in the past few days ... Given that Brent &apos;s support was taken away I was not surprised that it ( gas oil ) finished weak . 
earlier July gas oil expired $ 1.25 down at $ 161.25 . 
according to an IPE official , physical delivery against the expired contract will be 1,223 lots , or 122,300 tonnes , which traders said was in line with expectations . 
the delivery will be made largely by a major . 
deliveries against the June gas oil contract totalled 1,360 lots or 136,000 tonnes . 
meanwhile , IPE August Brent continued to trade in negative territory , but above a session low of $ 17.85 hit after the German news broke out .
