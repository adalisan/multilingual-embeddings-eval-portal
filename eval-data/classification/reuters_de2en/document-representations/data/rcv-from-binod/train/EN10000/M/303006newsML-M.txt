the prices of U.S. Treasury securities were ending mostly weaker Monday as traders regrouped ahead of new economic data releases . 
&quot; Nothing terribly special went on today . 
there were some comments from ( outgoing Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence ) Lindsey , but they had very little effect on the market , &quot; said Bill Kan , economist for fixed-income research on the trading floor at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . 
few investors chose to stake any positions ahead of the release of consumer prices and retail sales data on Tuesday . 
the yield on the 30-year bond continued to hover in the 6.85 percent range and a newspaper headline speculating about rising interest rates did little to lift spirits . 
in last Friday &apos;s selloff the yield rose as high as 6.90 percent , its highest level since closing at 6.92 percent on September 30 . 
the 30-year closed 2 / 32 lower at 95-17 / 32 to yield 6.85 percent Monday . 
&quot; We &apos;ve got statistics out on center stage tomorrow and without question it &apos;s going to be the hot spot of the week , &quot; said Fred Sturm , economist at Fuji Securities Inc . 
he too noted that trading was very quiet Monday . 
&quot; Any time you have these two numbers released together -- which happens about 40 percent of the time -- the average trading range for the front Treasury bond futures contract is 39 ticks , whereas over the past five years the average daily range is 28 ticks , &quot; Sturm said . 
on days when the CPI comes out alone , the range is 33 ticks , and when retail sales were released alone , the range was 36 ticks , he said . 
helping to keep a damper on activity Monday , aside from the obvious lack of data , were some festering worries for bond market participants , Sturm said . 
among those gnawing worries was the Japanese economy , he said . 
&quot; The Nikkei enjoyed a sort of bounce this morning , but that may just be a dead cat bounce , &quot; Sturm said . 
&quot; Their problems are deeper than they acknowledge , and if the Nikkei falls through the floorboards , you &apos;ll see a lot of banking institutions dumping U.S. treasuries and other assets in order to meet capital requirements . 
Friday &apos;s strong employment number and subsequent selloff also still cast a pallor over the Treasury securities market Monday . 
it caused some economists to revise their estimates of fourth quarter U.S. GDP growth upward to a range of 3.5 percent to 4.0 percent . 
many analysts worried that the Federal Reserve would move as soon as its next policy-making meeting on February 4 and 5 to slow growth if it feared the economy was overheating and the threat of inflation was growing . 
most forecasters still expected that the Fed would hold off until its March 25 meeting , however . 
two-year notes ended at 99-14 / 32 , down 1 / 32 , yielding 6.06 percent . 
five-year notes fell 2 / 32 to finish at 98-28 / 32 , yielding 6.39 percent . 
ten-year notes dropped 2 / 32 to end at 99-5 / 32 , yielding 6.62 percent . 
three-month bill rates rose one basis point and ended at 5.04 percent . 
six-month bill rates fell one basis point and finished at 5.11 percent . 
year bill rates rose one basis point and ended at 5.35 percent .
