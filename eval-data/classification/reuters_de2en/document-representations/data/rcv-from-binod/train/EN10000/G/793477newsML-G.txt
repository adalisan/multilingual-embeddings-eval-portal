&quot; Buthelezi you are going to rule the nation now , &quot; is a chant sung with conviction by thousands of supporters rallying behind South Africa &apos;s Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi . 
but political analysts see a less rosy future for Buthelezi -- President Nelson Mandela &apos;s long-time rival -- and his tribal-based Inkatha Freedom Party , a junior partner in South Africa &apos;s three-year-old unity government . 
in the country &apos;s first all-race elections in April 1994 Inkatha won only 10.5 percent of the national vote , which gave it three cabinet posts . 
however , in its stronghold province of KwaZulu-Natal , the party won just over 50 percent of the vote . 
Buthelezi is already gearing up to fight the 1999 elections with regular exhortations to the party faithful at rallies to find new members and work hard for victory . 
Inkatha recently closed three of its 14 national offices because it was short of money . 
it says it needs about 92 million rand ( $ 20 million ) to mount an effective campaign for the 1999 elections -- money Buthelezi has said it simply does not have . 
on top of its financial problems , Inkatha seems to be losing its hold over KwaZulu-Natal after a dismal showing in local government elections in June last year , when it lost heavily to Mandela &apos;s African National Congress ( ANC ) in urban areas . 
&quot; Inkatha &apos;s prospects of retaining electoral control of KwaZulu-Natal are fairly limited . 
my guess is they will lose their regional support base quite soon , say six to eight years , &quot; Professor Tom Lodge of the Witwatersrand University political department told Reuters . 
nor can Inkatha look at spreading its power beyond the borders of the province where the majority of its Zulu support base lives . 
&quot; There is not much prospect of Inkatha extending its appeal beyond KwaZulu-Natal because of their specific ethnic appeal . 
it doesn &apos;t stand much chance in attracting wide black support , &quot; Lodge said . 
but Alexander Johnston , political scientists at the University of Natal , said it was unlikely Inkatha would fade away completely . 
he said the party espoused strong traditional African values which would ensure its continued support from rural voters . 
Inkatha &apos;s support for a free-market economy could in the long run bring it closer to the ANC , which is trying to win foreign investors &apos; confidence but faces opposition to its macro-economic policies from its trade union allies , he said . 
&quot; The ANC is facing a lot of pressure from the left ( about its economic policies ) and Inkatha could become an important supporter of the ANC &apos;s moderates in divisive issues facing the ANC , &quot; said Johnston . 
lodge said Inkatha would play an important role in limiting attempts by the ANC to centralise power and gain a firmer hold over the country , where two of the nine provinces fall outside its control , namely KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape , which is administered by the former ruling National Party . 
&quot; Inkatha has developed a commitment to federal government . 
if it continues to defend that it could become an important force against any centralist tendencies of the ANC government , &quot; said Lodge . 
the ANC has already begun making overtures to Inkatha by making Buthelezi the acting president on at least three occasions when Mandela and his deputy Thabo Mbeki have been out of the country . 
highly placed sources within the ANC have said Buthelezi could be offered the position of deputy vice president as part of a peace package for KwaZulu-Natal . 
Buthelezi has declined to comment on such speculation . 
mapping out his party &apos;s future , Buthelezi told thousands of supporters at an annual congress in July that Inkatha needed radical restructuring and a purge of lazy leaders in the run-up to the 1999 elections . 
&quot; The greatest challenge confronting the Inkatha Freedom Party comes from within and not from without , &quot; said Buthelezi , an ANC member in the 1960s who broke with the movement in 1979 over its commitment at the time to armed struggle . 
although political violence has largely subsided elsewhere in the country , the turf war between supporters of the ANC and Inkatha has endured in the Zulu heartland . 
while a joint peace initiative is under way , the killings and animosity persist . 
secret peace talks over the past year have centred on addressing those differences . 
both Buthelezi and Mandela , who have given the process their support , have said the efforts were starting to pay dividends . 
but Buthelezi has said that unless the killing of Inkatha leaders ceased and was investigated , the peace talks could become a meaningless charade . 
Inkatha says some 400 of its leaders have died in the continuing feud .
