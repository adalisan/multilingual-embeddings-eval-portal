the International Federation of Human Rights ( FIDH ) demanded on Tuesday the release of a leader of its Tunisian branch who it said was detained as he returned home after criticising his government at a Paris meeting . 
the Paris-based FIDH said Salah Zeghidi , the vice-president of the Tunisian League for the Defence of Human Rights , was taken into custody at Tunis airport on Monday night . 
it said Zeghidi had voiced concern about human rights in Tunisia at a Paris meeting of major civil rights groups . 
voicing concern that he could be mistreated , FIDH said the Tunisian government would be held responsible if Zeghidi was tortured or hurt . 
Tunisia has in the past reacted angrily to criticism of its human rights record . 
five international human rights watchdog groups , including Amnesty International , accused Tunisia last month of widespread and worsening rights violations against political opponents and urged President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali to take steps to prevent future abuses . 
they said some prominent human rights activists had been prevented from leaving the country while others had been arrested , questioned and threatened with prosecution . 
in May , the European Parliament also expressed concern over the harassment of political opponents and their families and the absence of press freedom in the North African country .
