the Whitewater special prosecutor on Friday won the power to investigate whether a former White House lawyer lied to Congress about Hillary Rodham Clinton &apos;s role in hiring a key figure in the FBI files controversy . 
Kenneth Starr , the Whitewater independent counsel , received authorisation from a U.S. Court of Appeals to expand his already far-reaching investigation to cover whether former White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum committed perjury . 
at issue was Nussbaum &apos;s testimony under oath on June 26 before a hearing of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight concerning the White House &apos;s collection of hundreds of confidential FBI files . 
Nussbaum denied knowing who had hired Craig Livingstone , the former White House personnel security chief at the centre of the controversy over the White House &apos;s obtaining the files on prominent Republicans and others . 
Nussbaum in his testimony specifically denied discussing Livingstone with the first lady . 
but FBI agent Dennis Sculimbrene , in a report of an interview with Nussbaum in 1993 during a background investigation of Livingstone , said Mrs. Clinton had &quot; highly &quot; recommended Livingstone to Nussbaum . 
Lawrence Pedowitz , a lawyer for Nussbaum , said Reno &quot; obviously felt obliged &quot; to refer the matter to Starr &quot; because of partisan pressure from House Republicans . 
he said Nussbaum weeks ago denied to Starr &apos;s staff making the remarks to Sculimbrene . 
the report was not dated or signed , no notes supporting it have been found and Sculimbrene does not remember the conversation , Pedowitz said . 
&quot; Mr. Nussbaum stands by his House testimony , &quot; he said in a statement issued in New York . 
the first lady has said she had nothing to do with Livingstone &apos;s hiring . 
several committee members , including the Republican chairman William Clinger , charged that Nussbaum may have made false statements and requested the criminal investigation . 
Attorney General Janet Reno reviewed the allegations and determined that more investigation was warranted . 
in asking that the appeals court broaden Starr &apos;s probe , Reno said , &quot; I have concluded that further investigation is warranted to determine whether Mr. Nussbaum &apos;s statements before the committee are in fact false . 
she said an investigation by the Justice Department into whether Nussbaum committed perjury would constitute &quot; a political conflict of interest &quot; and said Starr , who already is examining the FBI files controversy , should handle the case . 
Starr was appointed in 1994 to investigate the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas involving Bill and Hillary Clinton in the 1980s , and the failure of a Little Rock savings and loan owned by their partners in the land deal . 
he earlier this year won appropval to investigate the firing of the White House travel office staff in May 1993 , a probe that involves former presidential aide David Watkins and the first lady &apos;s role in that affair . 
in June , Starr was authorised to investigate whether criminal laws had been broken when Livingstone and his aide , Anthony Marceca , collected approximately 900 FBI background files in late 1993 and early 1994 . 
Reno told the three-judge panel , based in Washington , that Starr has expressed &quot; his willingness to accept jurisdiction &quot; of the Nussbaum case . 
Reno &apos;s request was filed under seal on Thursday . 
the special three-judge court granted the request and made it public on Friday . 
last month , Clinton sought to portray Starr , a Republican , as partisan , and said it was &quot; obvious &quot; that the prosecutor was out to get him and the first lady .
