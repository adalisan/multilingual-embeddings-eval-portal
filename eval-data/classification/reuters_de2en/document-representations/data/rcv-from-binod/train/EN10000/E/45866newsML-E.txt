Iran &apos;s President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani left Tanzania on Wednesday with pledges to increase trade between their countries and build on their close relations . 
in a joint statement at the end of his three-day visit to Tanzania , the fourth leg of a six-nation African tour , he and host President Benjamin Mkapa said they agreed to enhance trade . 
&quot; They called for further expansion of existing cooperation in all economic , political , and cultural areas and welcomed the exchange of high-ranking delegations between the two countries , &quot; the statement said . 
it said both leaders sought changes in the U.N. structure , asking for a greater role for the U.N. General Assembly . 
Rafsanjani left for Zimbabwe and South Africa to drum up business and reduce Iran &apos;s isolation and the impact of U.S. sanctions . 
Washington accuses Tehran of sponsoring terrorism , a charge Iran denies . 
he and a 104-person delegation including Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati have already visited Kenya , Uganda and Sudan . 
the Iranian and Tanzanian presidents said they were concerned at the unequal and unfair trade and economic relations between industrialised and developing countries . 
at a dinner on Monday , Mkapa told Rafsanjani Tanzania wanted to boost trade with Tehran and invited Iranian business to invest in parastatals earmarked for sale under Tanzania &apos;s privatisation programme . 
Mkapa said more than 600 projects worth an estimated $ 1.5 bilion had been approved by Tanzania &apos;s Investment Promotion Centre ( IPC ) since 1992 but Tanzania &apos;s terms of trade appeared to be worsening . 
Washington last months tightened economic sanctions againt Iran with a law that would penalise companies which invest $ 40 million or more a year in the energy sector in Iran or Libya . 
U.S. diplomats were not present at Rafsanjani &apos;s welcoming ceremony at Dar es Salaam airport on Monday , witnesses said . 
Iran in recent years has steadily stepped up its diplomatic presence in Africa and tried to boost cultural and religious links with Moslems on the world &apos;s poorest continent .
