Brazil &apos;s Central Bank lowered its mini-band on the real currency by buying dollars at 1.0810 and selling at 1.0860 reais per dollar in the commercial foreign exchange market , dealers said . 
the previous mini-band was set on July 11 at 1.0800 to 1.0850 reais per dollar . 
Thursday &apos;s auction was the fourth time this month the bank has nudged the mini-band lower , and represents a 0.09 percent decline from the previous mini-band . 
so far this month , the Central Bank has shifted the mini-band 0.42 percent lower . 
dealers said Thursday &apos;s auction was absolutely routine and had been widely expected . 
Rumors of a possible devaluation caused a deep whipsaw on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange earlier this week , as traders wondered if the real might fall prey to the currency woes of Asian emerging countries that share Brazil &apos;s gaping fiscal and trade deficits . 
the real , however , did not come under any stress whatever . 
in the past Brazil &apos;s Central Bank has quickly snuffed out any attempts on its currency with its massive foreign reserves , now at $ 59 billion . 
in the last six months , the Central Bank has lowered the mini-band between 0.57 percent and 0.61 percent each month .
