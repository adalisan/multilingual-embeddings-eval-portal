U.S. mortgage-backed securities were mostly flat in a quiet Friday afternoon session , mortgage experts said . 
light buying and selling kept pass-through yield spreads to treasuries steady to a smidgen tighter , they said . 
&quot; There were a couple of sellers of Ginnie 7.0s today versus the 10-year ( Treasury bond ) , &quot; one trader at a New York investment bank said . 
&quot; And we saw one big buyer of Ginnie 8.0s , &quot; he added . 
specifically , Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5 percent paper was up 1 / 32 at 99-28 / 32 , yielding 99 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note . 
comparable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mae issues rose 1 / 32 as well , at 99-26 / 32 and 100 even , respectively . 
the 10-year note was off 2 / 32 at 97-23 / 32 to yield 6.57 percent . 
traders said many investors were on hold , waiting for a slew of data slated for release on Monday , such as personal income , a key survey of manufacturing activity , construction spending and automobile sales . 
&quot; Monday is a big day , &quot; said one , adding that &quot; it &apos;s sort of a reversal of Friday .
