a continuing flow of funds from the local money market boosted Zimbabwean industrial stocks to new records on Wednesday , surprising many brokers who had been predicting a correction this week . 
the main 57-share industrial index soared 226.36 points , or 2.2 percent , to close at a new all time high of 10,323.86 . 
when it breached the key 10,000 mark on Monday brokers predicted it would go no higher . 
&quot; I &apos;m surprised that it ( the market ) has gone to the levels it has at the moment . 
there doesn &apos;t seem to be an end to it because there &apos;s very positive sentiment on the market in most stocks , &quot; one broker said . 
&quot; But I still believe the market is in for a correction because it &apos;s becoming very expensive now and I would expect to see some kind of weakness coming in fairly soon but to say when is very difficult , &quot; he added . 
leading Wednesday &apos;s winners , bankers Barclays soared 650 cents to 4,000 , merchant bankers FMB surged 400 cents to 5,400 , agricultural investor Chemco leapt 300 cents to 2,600 and tobacco firm BAT jumped 100 cents to 2,500 . 
publishing group Zimpapers , finance house UDC , steel window and door-maker radar , sugar producer Hippo and winery Afdis each rose 50 cents to 2,750 , 400 , 500 , 1,250 and 500 respectively while clothing and furniture retailer Tedco at 1,170 and pharmaceutical group caps at 400 both gained 30 cents . 
clothing retailer Truworths added 25 cents to 1,275 as did cement producer Porthold to 1,600 while pork processor Colcom and cable manufacturer Bicaf each put on 20 cents to 430 and 380 respectively . 
a couple of counters bucked the trend , notably blue-chip beverages and supermarkets conglomerate Delta which fell 200 cents to 4,500 , hotel and supermarkets group Meikles which dropped 100 cents to 2,100 and finance company Finhold which shed 50 cents to 850 . 
Minings were mixed with brokers pointing to a softer gold price overseas . 
Wankie colliery added five cents to 610 while gold investor Falcon rose 50 cents to 1,250 . 
however , gold producer Ashanti slid 1,500 cents to 8,500 , leaving the seven-counter mining index 6.86 points down at 1,141.54 .
