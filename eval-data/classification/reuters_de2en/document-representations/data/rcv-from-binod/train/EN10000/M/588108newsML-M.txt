the Manila share index tumbled nearly three percent at close on Thursday as investors turned skittish on concerns the Philippines would suffer the same fate as Thailand &apos;s battered baht , traders said . 
&quot; It was precipitated by the big drop in Thailand &apos;s market on rumours about the baht being devalued . 
and we know how edgy people here are right now , &quot; said Jose Ricardo Garcia , executive vice-president at diversified Securities Inc said . 
&quot; Our market &apos;s weakness was exacerbated by the forex volatility arising from the effects of speculation against the baht , &quot; said Francisco Trinidad , research head at DBS Securities 
the Central Bank earlier raised overnight rates by 0.75 percentage points to 12 percent saying it was a preemptive move . 
the Bank said it was prepared to boost interest rates to protect the peso . 
traders said a rise in interest rates will trigger a shift to fixed-income securities from equities . 
turnover was modest at 2.32 billion pesos . 
in the broader market , losers clobbered gainers 111 to 17 with 61 issues unchanged . 
the market &apos;s main index was pulled down by losses in blue chips Metrobank , Meralco B , Philippine Long Distance telephone Co and San Miguel Corp. 
traders said although a technical recovery may not be surprising on Friday , investors would remain sidelined until the release of the eagerly awaited first quarter Gross National Product ( GNP ) figure and the result of the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting in the coming weeks .
