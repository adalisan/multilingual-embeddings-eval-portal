Zimbabwean shares continued weak on Monday as most of the big investors remained on the sidelines awaiting some key corporate results . 
brokers expected the trend to continue for a while , adding that some investors might soon be lured to the local money market where interest rates were edging towards an attractive 20 percent . 
&quot; volumes are generally very low . 
basically most people are waiting for the results of major counters like Delta which should be coming in the next week or so , &quot; one broker said . 
he said the highest volumes of trade on Monday were in newspaper group Zimpapers which effected a nine-for-one share split and offered shareholders a three-for-one bonus issue . 
the group traded at 160 cents per share after the split from 5,900 cents on Friday . 
the key industrial index shed 39.95 points to close at 10,754.42 , on the back of a 200 cent loss to 5,100 in bankers FMB while cement firm Porthold eased 150 cents to 1,700 and bankers NMB NMBZ.ZI and Barclays both put off 50 cents to 3,300 and 3,050 respectively . 
the secondary seven-share mining index came off 3.63 points to 1,018.54 with gold giants Ashanti 100 cents weaker at 10,500 while Alloy Prefs went down 25 cents to 95 and copper miners Mhangura were 5 cents lower at 25 .
