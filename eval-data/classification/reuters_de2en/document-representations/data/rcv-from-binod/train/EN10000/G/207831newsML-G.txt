Algeria &apos;s referendum next week on amending the constitution to ban politicians from using Islam as a weapon to gain power will be free and fair , the Algerian government promised on Thursday . 
&quot; I assert that the government has made and will make its utmost to enable the citizens once again to exercise their right to vote in full freedom and tranquility , &quot; Interior Minister Mustapha Ben Mansour said in a newspaper interview . 
Ben Mansour said young Algerians were showing interest in the referendum . 
&quot; I believe this youth enthusiasm shows they are interested and they intend to participate in all elections involving the country &apos;s future , &quot; he told the government-controlled El Moudjahid daily . 
Ben Mansour said the number of eligible voters reached more than 16.4 million -- some 464,000 more than those registered in last year &apos;s presidential poll . 
Algerian authorities , stepping up security to protect voters against possible Moslem rebel assaults , also announced they would ban truck traffic throughout the country on referendum day , November 28 , to thwart car bomb attacks . 
about 60,000 people have died in Algeria since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead . 
government ministers and allied political leaders were roaming the country urging voters to endorse the changes , saying the proposed constitution would help restore stability and security . 
the draft , if approved by the people , will replace the 1989 constitution , which ended the sole ruling party era . 
it broadens the president &apos;s paramount powers but limits him to two five-year terms . 
the text guarantees for the first time since independence in 1962 the right to form opposition parties to compete for power . 
but it bans politicians from using Islam , Arab and Berber languages , gender and regional differences as weapons to gain power . 
main opposition leaders oppose the referendum , saying President Liamine Zeroual &apos;s bid to change the constitution aims to establish what they call an &quot; institutional dictatorship &quot; . 
they called on Algerians to boycott the vote , hoping for a low turnout to embarrass the government .
