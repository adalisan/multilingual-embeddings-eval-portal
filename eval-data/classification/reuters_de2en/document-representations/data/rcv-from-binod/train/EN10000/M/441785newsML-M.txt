European stocks and bond markets went into retreat on Thursday after investors sold Wall Street down and inflation worries injected fresh nervousness into U.S. treasuries . 
Frankfurt led Europe &apos;s major bourses down , falling more than two percent at the opening of floor trade . 
London and Paris also dropped but the falls were nowhere as bad . 
on the currency front , the dollar opened below 1.70 marks for the first time in almost two weeks , pressured by a benign assessment of U.S. inflationary prospects in the Federal Reserve &apos;s Beige Book report on Wednesday and renewed firmness in the the mark and Swiss franc . 
&quot; There seems to be a generalised push back to marks and Swiss francs and as the Beige Book really gave us no strong view on the chances for rate rise ... the dollar &apos;s suffered , &quot; said Tony Norfield , treasury economist at ABN AMRO . 
by 1015 GMT the dollar was trading at 1.6949 marks and 122.32 yen , compared with 1.7023 marks and 122.62 yen in late trading on Wednesday . 
a selloff in high technology stocks and bonds was mainly behind the 45 point fall in the Dow Jones Industrial average to 7,039 points overnight , which followed two consecutive record highs . 
financial and pharmaceutical stocks , which have posted the sharpest rallies this year , also suffered .
