after a week in which Britain &apos;s FTSE 100 stock index set a series of record highs , investors on Friday turned a nervous eye to key policy meetings next week which could signal interest rate prospects in coming months . 
Monday &apos;s meeting between UK Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George , and Tuesday &apos;s meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve &apos;s policy committee , will be watched for any change in rate policy , traders and strategists said . 
the FTSE fell just short of cracking 4,000 on Friday , hitting a record 3,994.1 on the quarterly expiry of futures and options -- an event often prompting market volatility when players take positions for the coming three months . 
but the blue-chip index promptly erased its week &apos;s gains , shedding around 30 points from its peak amid worries about interest rates . 
strategists said the index still had energy in reserve to challenge its all-time highs , citing funds &apos; heavy cash reserves and continued strength in corporate results . 
but short term few investors would dare to press ahead . 
&quot; We could still see 4,000 points next week but only after those meetings , &quot; said Roger Monson , equity stragegist at Daiwa Europe . 
with strong UK money supply growth and retail sales booming , strategists said Clarke would not press for another rate cut . 
but uncertainty would nonetheless nag at the market . 
&quot; A cut is very unlikely but not completely impossible , &quot; said Robert Giles , strategist at Credit Lyonnais Laing . 
but strategists agreed U.S. rates were set to rise 25 basis points , a move Monson said would provoke a nervous shudder on the FTSE but could then see the market push onwards . 
dealers agreed . 
&quot; I firmly believe this market is going up , at least in the short term , &quot; said the head equity trader at one top investment bank . 
&quot; There is too much cash around and there is no reason for it to go down . 
on any dip people are coming in to buy . 
but players were loathe to predict spectacular gains . 
Richard Jeffrey , strategist at Charterhouse Tilney , noted that equities were looking fully valued with the FTSE 100 virtually at 4,000 points . 
&quot; While this does not rule out further progress this year , we believe that higher ground will be hard to defend , &quot; he said . 
if the upside appeared limited , the downside risk remained small with the corporate outlook favourable , experts said . 
Giles noted that some company profit estimates were being pared back for 1996 but were being maintained for 1997 . 
in addition , worries about a possible Labour government -- which had harried the market earlier this year -- were abating . 
&quot; The market &apos;s perception of political risk has changed ... we had actually expected the market to be far more worried about politics and that doesn &apos;t seem to be the case , &quot; Giles said . 
dealers said the market was on a more sober footing than the week &apos;s frantic dallying with its highs might suggest . 
Friday &apos;s expiry , which daunted many investors , turned into a damp squib . 
&quot; There were some people squaring up to each other but not a lot of business done . 
it was more like handbags at five paces , &quot; said the head equity trader . 
major companies reporting next week include Inchcape , tarmac , Barratt Developments , Guinness and Redland . 
data next week includes final UK gross domestic product for the second quarter on Tuesday and U.S. durable goods data on Thursday .
