Larry Brown stepped down as head coach of the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday , setting up a possible strange chain reaction in NBA &apos;s coaching fraternity . 
the head coaching job in Boston also became vacant on Wednesday as the Celtics announced that M.L. 
Carr would not return . 
Carr , who also serves as Celtics general manager , is expected to remain with the club in a front office capacity . 
Celtics executive Larry Bird , the team &apos;s former superstar forward , had recommended the highly successful and much travelled Larry Brown as a coaching candidate to Celtics chairman Paul Gaston . 
bird , who grew up in Indiana and was a college star at Indiana State , last week had dinner with Pacers president Donnie Walsh , who explored Bird &apos;s interest in coaching . 
Brown could face competition for the Celtics job from University of Kentucky coach Rick Pitino . 
the Boston Globe reported Wednesday that Pitino &quot; is very much back in the picture &quot; and that the Celtics &apos; proposal to Pitino may include part ownership of the team . 
Brown guided the Pacers to a 39-43 mark in 1996-97 , just his second losing season in 24 years as a coach in the NBA , the old American Basketball Association and college . 
Indiana , hit by injuries , missed the playoffs for the first time since 1989 . 
Brown leaves as the most successful coach in the 21-year NBA history of the franchise , compiling a 190-138 record . 
he was 229-107 in four seasons in the ABA and 177-61 in seven years at the college level , including a national championship with Kansas in 1988 . 
his overall coaching record is 1,030-648 . 
Boston went 15-67 this season under Carr , who said he looks forward to remaining with the Celtics . 
&quot; I said two years ago when I took over as head coach of the Celtics , we wanted to point this team in the right direction and return to a championship level of play , &quot; Carr said . 
&quot; Consistent with that plan , Paul ( Celtic chairman Paul Gaston ) and I feel that we are now ready to go to the next level and that finding the right coach to guide this team toward that goal is our top priority . 
the Celtics have two lottery picks , one of which could well end up being the top overall selection in the 1997 draft . 
this season was by far the worst in the history of the gloried franchise , which has won 16 NBA titles . 
bird said earlier this year that he would be interested in a coaching position with any team except the Celtics . 
he may not have wanted to offend Carr , a former teammate during the Celtics &apos; championship squads of the 1980s .
