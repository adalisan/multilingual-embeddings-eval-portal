Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas on Friday urged the European Union to start talks with all aspiring Baltic members at the same time . 
the EU &apos;s executive Commission on Thursday decided in principle to start talks with only one Baltic state , Estonia , as well as four other eastern European countries : Poland , the Czech Republic , Hungary and Slovenia . 
Lithuania and the third Baltic state , Latvia , have pushed hard to be included in a first wave of EU enlargement . 
&quot; The three Baltic countries do not differ from each other according to the criteria of the ( EU ) questionnaire and all three states should start talks at the same time , &quot; Brazauskas told a news conference . 
he was referring to the questionnaires sent out to each aspiring member state on their financial , social and legislative structure . 
Brazauskas said the opinion of the Commission was preliminary and remained to be finalised in Strasbourg next Tuesday , the day before the EU executive unveils advice on which countries are ready to start talks . 
all three Baltic states won independence in 1991 and have made rapid strides to throw off 50 years of Soviet rule . 
economic reforms , particularly in Estonia , have made faster progress than other ex-Soviet republics . 
Brazauskas said he was satisfied with the outcome of this week &apos;s NATO summit , which invited only Hungary , the Czech Republic and Poland to join in a first wave of new members . 
Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia were mentioned as &quot; Baltic region &quot; aspiring members . 
&quot; I am satisfed with the results , but of course it would have been more satisfying if Lithuania had been mentioned among the three countries , &quot; Brazauskas said . 
&quot; We should not lose our optimism . 
we are not forgotten and it is very clear which are the contenders in the Baltic region , &quot; he added . 
Moscow has made clear it would regard it as unacceptable for the Baltic states to be offered NATO membership .
