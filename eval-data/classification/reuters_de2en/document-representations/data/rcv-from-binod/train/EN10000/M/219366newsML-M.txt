IMM currency futures finished an abbreviated session mostly lower except for December sterling , which rallied in tune with cash cross activity . 
sterling / mark rallied to 32-month highs overnight and launched the December contract nearer to its 1.6904 contract high in followthrough action Wednesday . 
traders said belief that a British rate-hike was at hand coupled with bullish momentum fueled the rally . 
meanwhile , December yen sank to a fresh three-week low on fallout from Japan &apos;s quarterly Tankan report . 
analysts said the report showed only a modest economic recovery and confirmed sentiment that rates there will remain unchanged . 
&quot; The dollar was a factor , but it was really cross driven and weak yen driven , &quot; an IMM currency futures trader said . 
&quot; If we had had a full day with more traders on board , we would have seen more followthrough , &quot; he said . 
currencies closed early in observance of Thursday &apos;s U.S. thanksgiving holiday . 
trading will be suspended on Thursday and futures will close early again on Friday . 
&quot; I &apos;m looking for a stronger dollar Friday , for a lower currency opening and lower trading , &quot; the trader said . 
volume was moderate considering it was only a half-day of trade . 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange price boards listed estimated December yen volume of 8,912 and 10,000 in sterling . 
the dollar was also buoyed by comments from French Prime Minister Alain Juppe , who repeated that he thought the dollar was undervalued . 
there was scant response to two batches of U.S. data . 
first , U.S. third-quarter growth was revised up to 2.0 percent against expectations for 1.7 percent . 
the latest weekly jobless claims were reported at 342,000 , unchanged from the revised previous week . 
claims had been forecast at 336,000 . 
later , Chicago Purchasing Managers index and durable goods orders pulled Treasury bond futures from session highs and put a lid on stocks . 
traders said currencies were unaffected . 
the Chicago Purchasing Managers November Business Barometer was reported at 57.6 from 56.9 in October . 
U.S. October durable goods rose 0.1 percent . 
at settlement , December yen was down $ 0.000062 at $ 0.008844 , marks were off $ 0.0016 to $ 0.6550 , Swiss francs fell $ 0.0011 to $ 0.7751 , sterling rose $ 0.0034 to $ 1.6740 , Canadian dollars were down $ 0.0025 at $ 0.7437 , Australian dollars were up $ 0.0010 at $ 0.8109 and Mexican pesos were up $ 0.000050 at $ 0.125450 .
