physical copper premiums have edged higher in Europe as scrap merchants keep a firm grip on supplies and Russian off-grade material remains hard to come by , traders said . 
underlying demand , however , remains flat , they added . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think there is much fresh demand , but it &apos;s just a tightness of cathode locally due more to physical market technical reasons , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; lots of the grade A material is being taken out for the standard grade material , reducing the LME stocks , &quot; he added . 
the lack of scrap availability was still the major feature of the market , dealers said . 
&quot; The scrap has been very tight ever since the ( LME ) market fell in June and we haven &apos;t seen a recovery , &quot; one said . 
another said , &quot; The scrap will come out one of these days whether the price goes up or not because the scrap merchants will get fed up with holding it . 
it costs a lot of money to hold on to it . 
Off-grade Russian material was still difficult to find , with one dealer saying it was &quot; non-existent &quot; , but another saying the metal could be purchased if the right price was paid . 
premiums for Russian metal were still quoted at $ 10 below LME to flat , the same level as late September , up from $ 40 / $ 70 below LME in early September . 
one dealer said a decline in output from the Balkhashmys smelter in Kazakhstan was also helping to dry up supplies . 
the State Statistics Committee said on Tuesday that Kazakh copper output dropped sharply by 36.8 percent in September . 
&quot; That &apos;s nearly 10,000 tonnes a month not available to the market . 
that is putting some pressure on it , &quot; a dealer said . 
in Rotterdam Chilean metal was scarce but was going for $ 30 / $ 40 above LME and Good Western was quoted at $ 25 / $ 30 , about $ 5 higher than a couple of weeks ago . 
one dealer , however , quoted rates as low as $ 15 for Good Western . 
premiums in the UK have risen to $ 35 / $ 40 from $ 25 / $ 30 a couple of weeks ago , dealers said . 
&quot; There &apos;s very little around at the moment . 
I think the vessels have been coming in a bit late from Chile . 
but there are some due in the second half of the month , which will alleviate the situation , &quot; another trader said . 
one trader said there had also been talk that shipments through the North Sea were starting to slow down due to ice forming , but others said that was routine for this time of year .
