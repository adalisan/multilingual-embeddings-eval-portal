attorneys for Oklahoma City bombing defendant Timothy McVeigh on Friday asked the court to dismiss the case or , failing that , either delay it a year or move it to another location because of recent damaging pre-trial publicity . 
&quot; On the very eve of his day in court , and through no fault of his own , Mr. McVeigh &apos;s right to a fair trial has been fatally compromised , &quot; the defence team said in a court filing . 
the move followed two published reports , one from the Dallas Morning News and another from Playboy Magazine , that claimed McVeigh admitted planting the April 19 , 1995 , bomb at the Alfred P. Murrah federal building that killed 168 people . 
McVeigh &apos;s chief attorney Stephen Jones called the pre-trial publicity &quot; truly extraordinary in American jurisprudence &quot; and a &quot; raging news-fire . 
&quot; While it is true , of course , that Mr. McVeigh can still go to trial on his plea of not guilty , his efforts to defend himself on this ground will now be seen as nothing more than a hollow formalism at best , and a lie at worst , &quot; the defence said . 
Jones said the purported confession in the Dallas Morning News story represented a ruse created to persuade a reluctant witness to speak with the defence , although it was never shown to anyone the defence sought to interview . 
Jones did not address the accuracy of the Playboy article . 
after publication of the first article Jones considered seeking a delay , but decided against it . 
as expected the prosecution opposed the defence &apos;s motion . 
&quot; It is now the time to try the case in court rather than be held hostage to outside events that the court cannot control , &quot; the government said in its court filing . 
Jones , who spoke briefly to reporters outside the Courthouse , did not indicate how he expected the judge to rule , but said he is ready to start the trial later this month . 
&quot; Should this motion be denied we will be prepared to commence the trial on March 31 in this Courthouse behind us , &quot; Jones said . 
Prosecutor Sean Connelly said the motion presumed the Colorado jury pool was biased without individually questioning any juror . 
&quot; We , on the other hand , are confident the Colorado jury pool can be fair . 
that a panel of 12 fair-minded people and six alternates can be chosen from Colorado and that the trial should go forward as scheduled on March 31 , &quot; Connelly said . 
both sides said they expected U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch to make a ruling on the defence motion very soon . 
chief proseuctor Joseph Harztler said he had never heard of a case dismissed because of pre-trial publicity and that every day judges direct jurors to decide a case based only on the evidence presented in the courtroom . 
Hartzler said that while seeking a continuance because of pre-trial publicity is not unheard of , &quot; nobody expects this case to be delayed a year . 
Erwin Chemerinsky , law professor at the University of Southern California , said Jones had to file the motion in case there was a conviction and an appeal of the verdict . 
&quot; You can only raise an issue on appeal if you raised it at the trial , &quot; he said . 
in its request for a change of venue , the defence proposed moving the trial to Alaska , Hawaii , Puerto Rico , the U.S. Virgin Islands or Vermont .
