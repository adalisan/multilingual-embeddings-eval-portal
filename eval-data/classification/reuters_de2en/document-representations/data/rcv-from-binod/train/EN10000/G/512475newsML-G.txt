Australia cricket captain Mark Taylor on Wednesday said he would not stand down because of a personal form slump that has prompted calls for his sacking . 
but Taylor said he was unsure whether he would still have his job when selectors name a 17-man squad on Thursday for the forthcoming six-test ashes series in England . 
Taylor &apos;s failure to score a test 50 since late 1995 has prompted widespread calls at home for his dismissal despite Australia &apos;s emergence as unofficial world champions in test cricket under his leadership . 
speaking on his return from South Africa , where Australia won the test series 2-1 to follow a home victory over West Indies , the left-handed opener said selectors supported his decision to defy the critics by making himself available . 
&quot; The Australian selectors told me not to stand down and I won &apos;t be standing down , &quot; Taylor said . 
he received support from Australia vice-captain Ian Healy , who said all the players backed Taylor . 
&quot; Everyone knows that he needs to make runs and he needs to bat better &quot; Healy said . 
&quot; But the team really hasn &apos;t got a problem with it and we &apos;re all hoping and praying that he &apos;ll come out of ( the slump ) pretty soon . 
Taylor rejected recent comments by former test bowlers Dennis Lillee and Terry Alderman , who argued for his removal because of a lack of runs with the bat . 
Lillee said Australia should stick to a tradition of picking the best players in each position on current form and then choosing a captain from within their ranks . 
the fast Bowler , Australia &apos;s record test wicket-taker with 355 victims in 70 tests , argued that Taylor should lose his place as opener on that basis , ruling him out as captain . 
&quot; They ( Lillee and Alderman ) are also bowlers and blokes who haven &apos;t captained Australia , &quot; Taylor told reporters . 
Taylor , who has also been troubled by a back complaint this season , stood down for several limited overs internationals against South Africa , leaving wicketkeeper Healy in charge . 
Taylor said he was disappointed by the focus on his own position in recent weeks , claiming the speculation had overshadowed his team &apos;s performance in beating South Africa in both the test and one-day arena . 
Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne said selectors could pull a few surprises for the ashes tour , adding : &quot; I think it &apos;s probably going to be a tight series and from us there will be probably be a few surprise selections .
