U.S. blue chip stocks were expected to open slightly lower on Tuesday and technology stocks were seen opening with a firm tone , as markets focused on second quarter earnings results and retail sales data . 
the technology sector , which roared higher yesterday amid optimism for corporate results , would likely stay strong ahead of closely-watched second quarter results from chipmaker Intel Corp , due out today after the close , analysts said . 
but the Dow Jones Industrial average was expected to weaken at the open , given the strength of the dollar against various European currencies and the index &apos;s failure to rally despite a surge in the Nasdaq market yesterday , they said . 
&quot; You have to define which stock market you &apos;re talking about , &quot; Larry Wachtel , an analyst at prudential Securities , said . 
&quot; The Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 were powerful yesterday , but the Dow-30 stocks look lower here . 
demand for stocks seems to be moving away from blue chip names . 
U.S. blue chip stocks could get a lift if retail sales data for June were sluggish , sending bonds up , analysts said . 
&quot; If retail sales data are not too strong , that should give the bond market a boost and we could have a higher open , &quot; said Peter Cardillo , director of research at Westfalia Investments . 
retail sales were expected to rise 0.2 percent in June compared with a decline of 0.1 percent in May . 
ahead of the data , the long bond was down 8 / 32 to yield 6.57 percent and the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500 futures index was down 1.35 points to 925.50 . 
the Dow needed to see sustained strength in the bond market in order to rise much , Wachtel said . 
&quot; Unless we have a really strong rally in the bond market , I doubt the blue chips will take off , &quot; he said . 
a stronger dollar , which has touched six-year highs against the German mark , could also hurt the performance of multinational companies that depend on global markets for revenues , Cardillo said . 
&quot; The dollar has gotten too strong at these levels , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There is a panic to buy U.S. 
assets ... This ( the dollar &apos;s strength ) could be a drag on multinationals . 
the dollar fell from its session peak against the yen and was trading at 114.15 / 25 yen in Tokyo . 
in Europe , the dollar was steady , trading at 1.7950 / 60 marks . 
but so far , corporate second quarter results were coming in as forecast , bolstering the broader stock market and particularly the technology sector , analysts said . 
later in the day , the tech sector was expected to scrutinize Intel &apos;s second quarter results , to see if the rally had further momentum . 
Japan &apos;s Nikkei average closed off 159.31 points , or 0.79 percent , at 20,069.41 . 
share prices were eroded by profit-taking , brokers said . 
U.S. stocks were mixed in thin London trading . 
the Wall Street Journal said in its heard on the Street column that NationsBank Corp has been trying to assure investors that the $ 1.2 billion price-tag was not too much to pay to acquire Montgomery Securities . 
the New York Times said in its Market Place column that the fallout from MCI Communications Corp &apos;s announcement it would cost more than expected to break into the local telephone market could linger .
