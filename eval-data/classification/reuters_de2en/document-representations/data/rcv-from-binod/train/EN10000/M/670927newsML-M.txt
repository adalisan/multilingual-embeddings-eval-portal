world oil prices fell on Wednesday as a batch of data from the United States heightened market fears of a supply glut . 
the downtrend was reinforced as fund investors , hurt by a slide in prices to a new 13-month low last week , sold their futures positions -- to &quot; go short &quot; -- in advance of an OPEC ministerial on June 25 . 
it would only take one comment from a minister there to make the market move , &quot; one dealer said . 
London August futures for benchmark Brent Blend crude last traded 31 cents lower at $ 17.77 . 
but prices were underpinned by fresh concern over delays 
to the second six-month tranche of Iraqi exports covered by a humanitarian agreement between the United Nations and Iraq . 
an Iraqi diplomat at the U.N. in New York said on Wednesday Baghdad would not resume oil sales until money raised in Iraq &apos;s first six months of oil sales had all been spent . 
some $ 800 million of the $ 2 billion raised in Iraqi sales in six months to June cannot be spent until aid contracts are approved . 
&quot; The one thing we &apos;ve got to watch for is Iraq . 
their behaviour is very unpredictable to say the least , &quot; one broker said . 
market players were unsure whether the 11-member OPEC cartel would be able to bring some members -- who have exceeded their production quotas -- in line with those Gulf states who have complied . 
but prices were lower from the outset after figures from the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) -- the U.S. oil industry body -- showed record U.S. crude oil imports for the week ended June 13 and record gasoline output . 
and when data from the U.S. government &apos;s Energy Information Agency ( EIA ) reinforced this bearish picture , the market held onto its losses . 
the EIA data showed a 9.1 percent increase in U.S. crude imports to 8.73 million barrels per day for the four week period ending 13 June . 
and U.S. refinery crude runs increased 5.1 percent to 15.203 million . 
meanwhile , monthly data from the API showed that although gasoline demand got off to a flying start as the holiday &quot; driving season &quot; got underway in May , it was still lagging behind last year &apos;s levels . 
stocks of gasoline and blending components at the end of May stood at 201 million barrels -- four million barrels lower year-on-year , and 14 million barrels below a recent-year average . 
but brokers said trade was thinning out ahead of the OPEC meeting and though the market had fallen , it was only trending towards the bottom of a comfortable range it and settled in over the last week . 
&quot; The longer we spend in this range , the more violent will be the break when we move out of it , &quot; said Fenella Graham , energy manager at Mees Pierson in London .
