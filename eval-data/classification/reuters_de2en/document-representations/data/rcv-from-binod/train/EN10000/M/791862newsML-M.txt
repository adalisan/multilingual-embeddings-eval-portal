Bund futures climbed solidly on Monday as the strong mark and U.S. Treasury market gave German debt a one-two punch . 
traders said although the focus is Tuesday &apos;s repo announcement , most believe the central bank will continue to pursue steady monetary policy and that signs of an upbeat economy do not present any immediate bond market danger . 
&quot; There is no reason for the Bundesbank to make a change this time around , &quot; said Stuart Trow , bond market analyst at Norinchukin International plc in London . 
&quot; They will want to keep rates on hold . 
the DTB September Bund future was up 29 basis points in late afternoon trade at 101.89 and had traded as high as 101.99 earlier in the day . 
the Bundesbank is due to announce on Tuesday what form its repo allocation for this week will take -- an unchanged fixed repo at 3.00 percent , a variable repo , a repo at a higher rate or a combination of a fixed and a variable-rate repo . 
but traders said the resurgent mark has helped wash away speculation the Bundesbank would opt for anything other than another fixed 3.0 percent repo . 
the benchmark 10-year cash Bund climbed to 102.23 from 101.93 on the day to yield 5.69 percent . 
some analysts said although the market was stronger on Monday , they figure prices could head lower with some seeing the odds of an eventual tightening of German monetary policy growing . 
Trow said he saw the futures contract moving towards 101.30 / 40 over the near-term , once the immediate relief at the mark &apos;s recovery passes through the market . 
traders said after Bunds outperformed treasuries on Friday , they would look for German debt to continue outperforming amid signs of a rebound in the U.S. economy . 
on Monday afternoon the spread between treasuries and Bunds stood at 76 basis points .
