regional currencies were mostly steady in quiet dealings on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged overnight . 
&quot; The market was looking for a quarter percent hike . 
it is pretty suprising that the Fed did nothing , &quot; said a regional currency chief with a European bank in Singapore . 
he said the Fed &apos;s decision had no immediate impact on regional currency trading . 
&quot; But taking a broader view , no rate hike is a positive development for the Thai baht and the Indonesian rupiah to the extend that there would be no pressure on these economies to raise their interest rates at this point in time , &quot; he said . 
he said the economies of Thailand , Indonesia and to a certain extent Malaysia , did not need higher interest rates . 
the Indonesian rupiah firmed against the dollar in dull early trading with operators seen focusing on the month-end factor , dealers in Jakarta said . 
they said the Fed rates decision seemed to have sustained bullish sentiment on the rupiah . 
but the dollar-rupiah rate was trapped in narrow-range trading amid ample rupiah liquidity in the money market . 
spot rupiah was last at 2,317.70 / 18.30 at 0318 GMT , compared with an opening of 2,318.25 / 18.75 . 
one U.S. bank dealer said operators tended to go short on dollars due to the approaching month end . 
but further rupiah appreciation was limited by the central bank &apos;s band . 
dealers said there was no sign of strong dollar buying in the market despite abundant liquidity supply on Wednesday . 
the Thai baht was higher to 25.357-25.260 to the dollar early from 25.373-25.377 late on Tuesday . 
dealers in Bangkok said there was still selling interest in dollars for baht on Wednesday morning due to high baht short-term interest rates . 
the one-month dollar / baht swap premium was at 10.00-11.00 satangs per dollar early compared with 11.00-11.50 late on Tuesday . 
the Bank of Thailand fixed the mid-rate at 25.36 to the dollar against 25.38 on Tuesday . 
the Singapore dollar was little changed against the U.S. unit in quiet dealings and dealers said the local unit should stabilise at around the S $ 1.4050 level . 
the ringgit was confined to a range after trading both ways as month-end commercial dollar demand from Kuala Lumpur was matched by Japanese buying , dealers said in the Malaysian capital . 
&quot; Some Japanese started selling as soon as dollar / ringgit touched 2.5020 , &quot; said a European bank dealer in Singapore . 
she said strong commercial demand for the dollar from Kuala Lumpur had earlier lifted the ringgit from 2.50 level .
