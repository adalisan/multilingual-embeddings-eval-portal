Taiwan &apos;s central bank on Thursday denied a top policymaker &apos;s assertion that all government agencies had agreed to lower the official target zone for M2 growth to 8-13 percent from 9-14 percent . 
&quot; Officials of the Council for Economic Planning and Development have suggested lowering next year &apos;s targets for money supply growth but that proposal has not gone into further discussion , &quot; the central bank said in a statement . 
&quot; No consensus has been reached , &quot; it said . 
&quot; The bank is evaluating the money supply growth target zone for 1997 and no decision has been made . 
we will announce that at the year-end news conference , &quot; it said . 
the bank has called a news conference for December 31 . 
Chi Schive , vice-chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development , the cabinet &apos;s main maker of economic policy , had told Reuters on Thursday that government-wide agreement had been reached to lower the target zone . 
&quot; All related officials have agreed to lower the M2 target zone to 8-13 percent , &quot; Schive said by telephone . 
&quot; It &apos;s only a matter of timing when it will be done . 
we &apos;ll leave this to the central bank to decide . 
the wording of the central bank &apos;s subsequent statement suggested that Schive had overstepped his bounds . 
&quot; The bank is the agency responsible for setting up and executing our monetary policy , &quot; it said tersely . 
the central bank lowered the M2 growth target to the current 9-14 percent from 10-15 percent in December 1995 . 
a downward adjustment would reflect persistent failure of the key indicator of Taiwan &apos;s broadest money supply measure to reach even the bottom of the target zone in 1996 . 
the latest monthly reporting of M2 growth was for October , when it came in at a year-on-year 8.45 percent . 
m2 growth was 8.69 percent in September and 8.44 in August . 
economists have said it was unlikely that M2 would come in above nine percent in the final two months of 1996 despite signs that a fourth-quarter economic recovery is under way . 
Schive cautioned the adjustment should not be seen as trying to influence monetary policy at a time of loose liquidity . 
&quot; It &apos;s not related to policy tightening . 
it &apos;s simply reflecting reality , &quot; he said . 
Schive said the adjustment reflected the actual conditions now seen in Taiwan &apos;s still-sluggish economy , which saw gross domestic product growth of 5.61 percent in the third quarter and is on track to reach only 5.7 percent for all of 1996 . 
&quot; The money supply mainly reflects economic activity and expectations on inflation , &quot; Schive said . 
&quot; If we expect low inflation , money supply growth should be conservative . 
Taiwan inflation has remained under control at around three percent through 1996 and is on track to come in at 3.1 percent for all of 1996 , according to government projections . 
inflation has remained low despite persistent looseness of liquidity in Taiwan &apos;s huge money market , where the central bank has pledged to maintain its &quot; steady-to-loose &quot; monetary policy to give any recovery the best chance of taking hold . 
the central bank has vowed act to tighten money supply only if inflationary pressure rises or loose money is seen fuelling a stock market rally at the expense of currency stability . 
Schive said global inflationary pressure was declining at a time of structural change in Taiwan &apos;s money market , where commercial paper and bond issuance is gaining popularity at the expense of bank lending and credit card use has soared . 
&quot; Direct financing is developing faster than indirect financing , and the use of plastic money has reduced actual money supply , &quot; Schive explained . 
Central bank and other economic officials have expressed frustration that enterprises have not tapped the loose liquidity more aggressively , despite the attractiveness of rates at their current low levels . 
Central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong , explaining the bank &apos;s reluctance to tinker with interest rates , has said monetary policy adjustments were no &quot; cure-all &quot; for an ailing economy .
