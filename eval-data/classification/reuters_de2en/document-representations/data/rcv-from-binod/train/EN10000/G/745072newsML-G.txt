the coach of Ukrainian premier division side Metalurg Mariupol is on the run from police after being banned for life for allegedly beating up a referee last week . 
special units were dispatched to the eastern city of Luhansk after reported sightings of Yuri Pohrebnyak , but so far they have not tracked him down , Olexander Tkachenko , a senior Mariupol police official said on Tuesday . 
&quot; No one has seen Pohrebnyak since the incident . 
he &apos;s simply disappeared , &quot; said Ivan Haivoronsky , an official with the soccer authorities for Ukraine &apos;s eastern Donetsk region . 
&quot; The club says they &apos;re looking for him because of the case launched by police . 
Pohrebnyak was banned for life after allegedly leading an angry mob who beat up the referee and a linesman in their hotel room after a 5-2 home defeat by Vorskla Poltava on July 13 . 
in his absence , things have got no better for the steel town team on Ukraine &apos;s south coast . 
Newly-promoted Mariupol lost 5-0 at Nyva Ternopil at the weekend , leaving them with no points and 15 goals conceded after just three games of the new season .
