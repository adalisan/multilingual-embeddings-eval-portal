Peru &apos;s highest military court has rejected an appeal from Lori Berenson , an American woman jailed for allegedly being a Tupac Amaru guerrilla , to have her life sentence reduced , judicial sources said on Monday . 
&quot; With this decision , the case is closed and unfortunately all that is left now is for her to serve her life sentence , &quot; a spokesman for the Supreme Military Justice Council said . 
the five-member council made its decision on Berenson &apos;s appeal in early April but delayed announcing it until after troops stormed the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence in Lima where the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) held 72 captives for 126 days . 
&quot; The crime is proved , the evidence is sufficient , and the court has declared null her appeal for a sentence reduction , &quot; the spokesman added . 
Berenson was sentenced in January 1996 by a &quot; faceless &quot; military court for allegedly helping plot a takeover of Peru &apos;s Congress by the Cuban-inspired Tupac Amaru group . 
she is serving her sentence at the notoriously cold and grim Yanamayo maximum-security prison in the 13,000-foot-high ( 4,000 metres ) Andean city of Puno . 
the Tupac Amaru hostage-takers included Berenson in a list of prisoners whose release was their principal demand after the Dec . 17 takeover of the Japanese compound . 
all 14 rebels , two soldiers and one of the hostages died when Peru &apos;s military stormed the building on April 22 . 
since her conviction on charges of treason , there has been a growing campaign in the United States , actively supported by former President Jimmy Carter , to annul the sentence of the secret court , where judges and lawyers wore hoods and cross- examination was not allowed . 
Berenson &apos;s parents , who say their daughter is suffering severely from the altitude and poor food and conditions at Yanamayo , insist that she is innocent and are demanding a retrial in a civil court .
