shares sagged in thin trade on Monday with investors sidelined ahead of bourse-driver Nokia &apos;s first quarter results due on Tuesday , brokers said . 
Nokia fell 5.50 markka to 301.00 after a steep fall in New York to the equivalent of 295 markka on Friday , but closed off intra-session lows in Helsinki at 301.00 markka . 
forestries were weak overall , failing to take strength from Enso &apos;s plan to take over German Holtzmann to become Europe &apos;s second-largest paper group after UPM-Kymmene . 
the forestry sub-index fell 0.54 percent , with Enso down 1.00 markka at 42.50 and UPM down 0.50 at 117.00 . 
&quot; SCA &apos;s result was weak , that pulled Swedish forestries down , and they dragged Finnish forestries with them , &quot; one broker said , adding there was no consensus view on the 1.8 billion markka price Enso paid for 50 percent of the German group . 
after the close , Enskilda booked a big in-house deal in insurer Sampo -- 150,000 shares at 475.00 markka , up 3.00 . 
that boosted overall volume by over 70 million markka , from a meagre 366 million markka at the official close .
