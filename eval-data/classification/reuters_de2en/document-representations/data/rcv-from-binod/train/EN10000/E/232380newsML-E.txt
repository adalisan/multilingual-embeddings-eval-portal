October 1996 had one more shopping day than October 1996 . 
on a daily basis , the increase was 0.3 percent . 
a spokesman for the office , elaborating on the report , said it was the first monthly increase since sales rose in February 1996 by 3.8 percent in value terms , and 4.5 percent in price- adjusted terms . 
but February 1996 had one more shopping day than in 1995 , so turnover per day in that month actually fell 0.3 percent .

adjusted for inflation , the office said real retail turnover in October was 4.7 percent higher than last year .
