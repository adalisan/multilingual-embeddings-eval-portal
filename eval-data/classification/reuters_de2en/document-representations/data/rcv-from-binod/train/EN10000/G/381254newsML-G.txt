Hong Kong &apos;s future leader Tung Chee-hwa said on Sunday he would announce within days his team of top civil servants who will help him govern the territory after Britain hands it back to China later this year . 
&quot; I hope , tomorrow or the day after , I would let you know of my decision ( on the team ) , &quot; he said at a news conference following his first meeting with British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind since Tung &apos;s appointment in December . 
the British colonial administration has urged Tung to make as few changes as possible in the ranks of top civil servants , who hold powerful positions akin to cabinet ministers in Britain . 
Tung won public acclaim by inviting Hong Kong &apos;s popular Chief Secretary Anson Chan , head of the civil service and deputy to British governor Chris Patten , to stay on , a move seen as a guarantee of considerable continuity in uncertain times . 
Chan accepted but the fate of her senior policy secretaries remains to be decided . 
Tung dismissed suggestions that Beijing had a hand in vetting his list of top officials . 
Tung also said he hoped the British would agree to second one or two of their top civil servants to his private office ahead of the handover at midnight on June 30 , 1997 . 
&quot; I hope to have one or two principal officials come over to help me . 
Tung named his inner circle of advisers last month , which included two members of colonial Governor &apos;s Executive Council . 
he also followed the practice of the departing British administration of reserving slots on the council for Hong Kong &apos;s top three civil servants -- currently the chief secretary , Attorney-General and financial secretary .
