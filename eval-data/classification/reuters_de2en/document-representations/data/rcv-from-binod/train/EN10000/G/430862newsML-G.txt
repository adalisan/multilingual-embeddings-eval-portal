Nepal &apos;s main communist party and two allies formally staked a claim to power on Monday , and the centrist Nepali Congress party said it appeared to lack the votes needed to continue ruling the Himalayan kingdom . 
unified Marxist-Leninist ( UML ) general secretary Madav Kumar Nepal and Lokendra Bahadur Chand of the centrist Rashtriya Prajatantra Party ( RPP ) registered their joint claim at the gates of King Birendra &apos;s palace at 11 : 35 a.m. ( 0550 GMT ) , witnesses said . 
the UML leader told Reuters outside the palace that his party and its allies controlled 103 of 205 seats in the lower house of parliament , and would support the RPP &apos;s Chand as the new prime minister . 
&quot; We have produced 103 signatures supporting Chand , &quot; Nepal said . 
Nepali Congress officials said their plan to stake a claim appeared in trouble . 
&quot; I think we cannot form the government , &quot; Chakra Prasad Bahtola , tourism minister in the caretaker cabinet , told Reuters .
