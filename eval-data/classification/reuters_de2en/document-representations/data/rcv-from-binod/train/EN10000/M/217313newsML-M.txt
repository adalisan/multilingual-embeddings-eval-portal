the Indonesian rupiah fluctuated against the dollar in moderate late trade on Tuesday following comments by Finance Minister Mar &apos;ie Muhammad , dealers said . 
mar &apos;ie told parliament the widening of the central bank &apos;s dollar-rupiah trading band was positive for foreign debt payments . 
&quot; The strengthening of the rupiah does not put a burden on our principal and interest debt payments . 
the effect was instead positive because we only need less rupiah to repay debts , &quot; he said . 
the comments triggered immediate dollar selling by offshore players , sending spot dollars down to a low of 2,343.0 at midday from a high of 2,345.80 level . 
&quot; offshore players are very sensitive to band news . 
it seems they are nervous because they have gone short on dollars for some time on expectations of a band widening , &quot; one said . 
&quot; Although this report was referring to the past , they just sold and sold until meeting support from locals , who firmly believe there will be no widening for the mean time , &quot; he added . 
local buying helped spot dollar recover to 2,344.50 / 44.75 at 0930 GMT but met strong resistance at the 2,345.0 level . 
the dealer said a higher central bank fixing later was also helpful in convincing operators that the central bank had no plan to widen the band in the medium-term . 
tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,343.75 / 44.25 and 2,344.5 / 44.7 , respectively . 
one European bank dealer said sentiment on the dollar remained strong but it might take time to recover again . 
&quot; initially , the dollar was trading at the healthy level around 2,345.0 . 
but this comment seemed to cause some uncertainties among offshore operators , &quot; he said . 
the dealer said , however , local operators continued to favour the dollar on the back of sustained flush liquidity and cheap roll-over costs although short-dated swaps edged up slightly due to the approaching month-end factor . 
dealers said the market was surprised by a sudden jump in overnight money to 15 percent from 8.5 / 9.0 percent following possible mismatches among some banks . 
but overnight money fell back to 10.0 percent at close as the market stabilised . 
dealers said the market was anticipating further narrowing in interest rate differentials between the dollar and the rupiah after Bank Exim Indonesia cut its deposit rates by one percentage point on Tuesday . 
Bank Negara Indonesia took the lead by lowering its deposit rates by 50 basis points on Monday . 
dealers said expectations of decreases in interest rates caused longer-term money and swap rates to soften . 
the European bank dealer said swap rates were relatively stable on Tuesday , but they stayed under pressure .
