leading European share markets slipped on Monday , deprived of Wall Street &apos;s guiding hand which has led them on a bull run since the New Year . 
the foreign exchange market also lacked inspiration due to the President &apos;s Day holiday in the United States , with the dollar down from Asian highs against the yen as unease grew that the Bank of Japan might mount a surprise intervention . 
British , German and French stocks all fell back in morning trade following a lower close on Wall Street on Friday before the long U.S. holiday weekend . 
&quot; Wall Street has been one of the main things driving us along and that &apos;s closed today , &quot; one London trader said . 
&quot; We &apos;re unlikely to want to go too much higher on our own . 
in London , the FTSE 100 index was down 20.1 points at 4,320.9 at mid morning after closing at a record on Friday . 
investors suffered the additional twin worries of a strong sterling , which hurts British exporters , and a parliamentary vote scheduled for Monday night which is aimed at bringing down the Conservative government . 
&quot; Nobody likes this kind of instability , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; Sterling has been a constant worry but the worry hasn &apos;t been going away and we could see it hurting again today . 
the opposition Labour Party will try to bring down the government with a vote expected around 2200 GMT on whether to censure Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg over his handling of the Mad Cow disease crisis . 
if Prime Minister John Major lost , there would be a confidence vote in the government the next day . 
if he lost that vote , Major would have call an early general election . 
however , Monday &apos;s vote is likely to be little more than a nagging worry as Major is expected to win it narrowly and he has to call an election by May in any case . 
German stocks likewise fell , with dealers citing profit taking after recent hefty gains and Friday &apos;s losses on Wall Street , where the Dow Jones Industrial average closed down 33.48 points at 6,988.96 . 
profit takers also stalked the Paris market , with the CAC 40 index down 16.75 at 2,610.67 . 
car maker Renault lost 3.27 percent to 118.5 francs after warning last week that its losses would be worse than the market expected . 
on the foreign exchange markets , the dollar was off overnight highs , weakened by aTokyo report that Japan would intervene alone if the yen fell sharply . 
with the dollar surging against the yen , Jiji news agency said the United States had agreed at the recent meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations to unilateral Japanese action on the forex market . 
this would mark an abandoning of old U.S. objections due to fears of a growing Japanese current account surplus and complaints from U.S. industry over the dollar &apos;s strength . 
in Europe , top monetary officials added their voices to the chorus calling for dollar moderation . 
European Monetary Institute President Alexandre Lamfalussy said the dollar &apos;s correction of past imbalances was now exaggerated , while Bundesbank vice president Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said he saw no reason for a weaker mark . 
the dollar hit a new 34-month high of 1.6962 marks in Asia . 
although it had retreated to 1.6932 by mid morning it was well up from late Friday &apos;s European level of 1.6878 . 
the dollar eased to 124.06 yen from its previous European close and off an overnight peak of 124.67 . 
again , the U.S. holiday should subdue trade but analysts warned that thin volume could mean choppy conditions . 
some argued that this might tempt central banks to launch a round of intervention . 
but the dollar could soon push ahead again . 
&quot; If the opportunity is not taken today to back up the fine words of G7 with positive action , the dollar should be through 1.70 marks tomorrow morning and ( the G7 &apos;s ) job of influencing price action in future will be made immensely more difficult , &quot; said Nick Parsons , forex strategist at Banque Paribas . 
the dollar was quoted at 1.6932 marks and 124.06 yen compared with 1.6878 marks and 124.67 yen in late European trading on Friday . 
gold was at $ 343.65 an ounce , compared with Friday &apos;s close of $ 343.05 . 
silver was at $ 5.21 , up five cents from Friday &apos;s close .
