France face the tough task of proving to their supporters that they are on the right World Cup track when they meet Italy in the last match of the Tournoi de France at Parc des Princes on Wednesday . 
Aime Jacquet &apos;s French side have so far disappointed , losing 1-0 to England at Montpellier after a creditable second half against Brazil in which they snatched a 1-1 draw in Lyon in the opening match of their 1998 World Cup warm-up tournament . 
both sides will be looking to avoid the wooden spoon , the Italians after a 2-0 defeat by tournament winners England and their memorable 3-3 draw with world champions Brazil in Lyon on Sunday . 
Jacquet began his France career in 1994 with a 1-0 win over Italy in a friendly in Naples at the start of a 30-match unbeaten run that ended away to Denmark in Copenhagen in November . 
now the circumstances are quite different and Jacquet , keeping his cards close to his chest , will not name his team until the last minute . 
Jacquet , whose bete noir is an attack short of goals , argues that what counts at this experimental stage is &quot; that the French team should be ready in a year . 
&quot; Those two teams ( Brazil and Italy ) are superior to us in the domaine of finishing , &quot; Jacquet said after praising their 3-3 draw . 
France , although conceding only two goals , have scored just one in the tournament . 
goalkeeper Fabien Barthez will miss the match after injuring a finger when Alan Shearer scored England &apos;s winner . 
Auxerre veteran Lionel Charbonnier steps up for his first cap . 
Le Havre &apos;s Christophe Revault has interrupted his holidays to join the squad as reserve &apos; keeper . 
in midfield , Christian Karembeu should be back after twisting an ankle early in the game against Brazil in a side close to Jacquet &apos;s classic best . 
France are expected to bring back attacking midfielder Ibrahim Ba on the right , line up with their most experienced back four and put both Zinedine Zidane and Youri Djorkaeff in the playmaking department . 
this would leave room for just one striker , AC Milan &apos;s Christophe Dugarry , as in Euro 96 . 
the Italians , who have not beaten France since the 1978 World Cup finals in Argentina but lead 17-6 in 29 meetings so far , are forced through injuries to make several changes . 
neither Dino Baggio nor Demetrio Albertini , who played against Brazil , are fit , the Milan player having left France early for planned groin surgery . 
this will probably mean Gianfranco Zola , who prefers a forward role , linking up with Attilio Lombardo and his Chelsea team mate Roberto Di Matteo in midfield behind the unchanged strike pair of Christian Vieri and Alessandro Del Piero . 
at the back , and with captain Paolo Maldini doubtful , coach and father Cesare will probably include both Stefano Torrisi and Alessandro Nesta while bringing back Antonio Benarrivo to replace the younger Maldini . 
the Italians greatest concern is the five goals they have conceded in two matches . 
&quot; A great fatigue provoked the spaces which Brazil needed to express themselves , &quot; said Dino Baggio . 
&quot; In good health , Brazil would not have caught up with us . 
probable teams : 
France - Lionel Charbonnier ; Lilian Thuram , Laurent Blanc , Marcel Desailly , Bixente Lizarazu ; Ibrahim Ba , Christian Karembeu , Didier Deschamps , Zinedine Zidane ; Youri Djorkaeff , Christophe Dugarry . 
Italy - Angelo Peruzzi ; Christian Panucci , Alessandro Nesta , Alessandro Costacurta , Stefano Torrisi , Antonio Benarrivo ; Attilio Lombardo , Gianfranco Zola , Roberto Di Matteo ; Christian Vieri , Alessandro Del Piero . 
referee : Antonio Lopez Nieto ( Spain )
