the rightist Solidarity union on Wednesday urged its supporters to vote in a May 25 referendum against a new Polish constitution backed by the ruling ex-communists and three other major parties in parliament . 
the call could make the vote an important test before elections this year when Solidarity aims to lead the right &apos;s comeback to parliament , from which it was swept in 1993 . 
&quot; The national committee calls on its members to participate en masse in the referendum and to vote against parliament &apos;s draft of the constitution , &quot; Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski told a news conference . 
the national assembly of both parliamentary chambers early this month approved a compromise draft agreed between the two ruling groupings and the two main opposition parties . 
if approved in the referendum , the bill would take effect three months after the president signs it , replacing the Stalinist-era 1952 charter which has been repeatedly amended since the 1989 fall of communism to reflect democratic change . 
the right , including the powerful Solidarity Electoral Action alliance newly formed around the union , wanted a new constitution which espoused patriotic and Roman Catholic values and it had submitted its own &quot; Citizens &apos; &quot; draft . 
among other demands , the union wanted it to clearly invoke God in the preamble and to contain an implicit ban on abortion . 
it regards the draft agreed by the ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance and its smaller Peasant Party coalition partner , as well as the two main opposition groups , as unrepresentative of the many Poles whose candidates did not enter parliament in 1993 . 
Krzaklewski said the four parties had not only refused to let the public choose between the parliamentary version and the Citizens &apos; draft , they had also rejected any changes suggested by the right . 
the parties say they did adopt some Solidarity ideas and could not put the Citizens &apos; draft to a referendum without lengthy procedural changes . 
the referendum will present voters with a choice between the parliament draft and staying with the current makeshift arrangements until a new alternative is prepared . 
&quot; The parliamentary draft is a confrontational one ... we simply have no choice and must vote against it , &quot; Krzaklewski said . 
opinion surveys suggest Solidarity and the ex-communists are roughly neck and neck before the elections , but the referendum may be a risky battle ground for Solidarity . 
an opinion poll last month by the public CBOS agency showed 41 percent of Poles would support parliament &apos;s constitution , 15 percent would reject it , while the rest were undecided . 
Krzaklewski , who himself plans to stand for parliament in Gliwice , southern Poland , said that whatever happened on May 25 the union would press on with preparing an election challenge . 
some right-wingers say the ex-communists have hastily pushed the constitution through so the referendum takes place before Pope John Paul starts a visit to Poland on May 31 , which might have turned voters against the secular-minded constitution .
