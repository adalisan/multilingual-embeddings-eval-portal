the dollar stuck to familiar ranges just below 116 yen and above 1.69 marks in early Europe , finding little impetus to break either way , said traders . 
&quot; The dollar is lacking a bit of interest , to be honest . 
we &apos;ve got a long-weekend coming up and some of the banks are off , &quot; said a senior dealer at a UK merchant bank . 
at 0720 GMT dollar / mark was trading at 1.6910 / 15 against 1.6943 / 53 in late Europe on Thursday , though above overnight lows around 1.6880 marks . 
against the yen , the dollar was unchanged at 115.80 / 5.90 against 115.80 / 85 in late Europe on Thursday . 
traders said the dollar was relegated to the side-lines as the market eyed a stumble in sterling , punished by speculation Bank of England Governor Eddie George might not be reappointed at the end of his five-year term next year . 
&quot; Most interest is on sterling and its crosses after the well-publicised dispute between ( finance minister ) Gordon Brown and Eddie George , &quot; said the trader . 
at 0735 GMT , sterling / mark was trading at 2.7535 / 45 against 2.7845 / 55 in late dealings on Thursday . 
dollar markets , however , should find some comfort from the overnight release of the Federal Reserve &apos;s March 25 minutes . 
analysts said that as the minutes showed the Fed voting unanimously at its March 25 meeting to raise the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point , positioning toward higher rates should therefore be a catalyst for the dollar to edge higher in the weeks ahead . 
but not all analysts are as optimistic . 
&quot; We haven &apos;t seen a dramatic response from interest-rate markets . 
unless the economic data shows the economy is rapidly rebounding from its slight slowdown , there will be doubt in people &apos;s minds whether a tightening is inevitable at the next FOMC , &quot; said Paul Meggyesi , senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
&quot; The report leaves a couple of question marks about the near-term direction of rates , &quot; he added . 
German April month / month producer prices were a touch higher than expected as they grew 0.3 month / month and 0.9 percent year / year against forecasts for 0.1 percent month / month growth and of 0.7 percent year / year . 
&quot; Producer prices were slightly worse than expected . 
but they do not alter the outlook for Bundesbank policy , &quot; Meggyesi said .
