West Indies master batsman Brian Lara ended his longest slump in test cricket with a defiant display of big hitting on the third day of the fourth test match against Australia on Monday . 
but Lara &apos;s 65 not out , including 11 fours and two sixes , appeared a virtual oasis in a West Indies batting desert , as four wickets fell about him in the final session to leave his team 154 for six at the close of play . 
the West Indies have the mammoth task of reaching 387 with just four wickets in hand on a turning pitch to make Australia bat again . 
Australia , who lead the best of five match series 2-1 , are now virtually assured of a victory , which would deliver a series win and allow them to retain the Frank Worrell trophy they won in the Caribbean in 1995 . 
Lara , under immense pressure after scoring just 86 runs in his last seven test innings , chose to attack as the shadows lengthened on the tree-lined oval , lashing Australia &apos;s leg spin duo of Shane Warne and Michael Bevan to all parts of the ground . 
Lara bought up his 50 with a brutal cut for four off Shane Warne , giving him some revenge over the leg spinner . 
Warne snared the wicket of Lara for nine in the first innings when Lara waltzed down the pitch to Warne &apos;s first ball and succeeded in scooping a mis-hit drive to mid-off . 
Lara &apos;s self-destruction was the centrepiece of a dismal West Indies first innings of 130 and drew some savage criticism about a perceived lack of discipline in the local press . 
his swashbuckling reply in the last session was his first test 50 since May last year and his first venture into double figures in a test since late November . 
but despite Lara &apos;s example , the wickets kept tumbling around him . 
Warne and Bevan , who is playing his first match as a recognised leg spinner , again ran amok through the West Indies . 
Bevan took three for 56 , fooling first Shivnarine Chanderpaul ( 8 ) and then Sherwin Campbell ( 24 ) into nicks to first slip with his bouncy brand of left armed leg spin . 
Bevan , who has until now been chosen as a batsmen who bowls occasionally , was brought on within the first hour in both innings and has taken seven wickets in the match so far . 
earlier an unusally tentative Bevan batted for 324 minutes to compile 85 not out in Australia &apos;s first innings of 517 . 
the feature of Australia &apos;s morning batting effort was the dismissal of home town boy Greg Blewett for 99 , which stunned the Adelaide Oval crowd of about 20,000 . 
a careful Blewett seemed to be forging inexorably towards his test third century when right arm fast Bowler Cameron Cuffy sent down a ball that seamed back between Blewett &apos;s bat and pad to clip the top of off-stump . 
the 25-year-old South Australian strode from a hushed ground in disbelief , his head down and cursing . 
the packed Oval just managed to stir itself into a standing ovation as a grim-faced Blewett walked into the dressing room .
