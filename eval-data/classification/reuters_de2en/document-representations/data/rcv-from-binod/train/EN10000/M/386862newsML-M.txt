wall Street stocks closed moderately lower on Wednesday , as a soft bond market prompted broad profit-taking after Tuesday &apos;s sharp large cap rally . 
the Dow industrials fell 47 points to close unofficially at 7020 . 
&quot; This looked like a reversal of what we saw yesterday , &quot; said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany . 
&quot; People are going to view this as profit-taking . 
Johnson said a lackluster performance in the bond market , where long-term yields rose to 6.58 percent despite this morning &apos;s release of a very favorable consumer price index , likely served as a catalyst for the sell-off in stocks . 
&quot; I think the bond market &apos;s failure to respond to that news was part of the problem today , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It certainly might have been the excuse to take some profits in stocks . 
U.S. financial markets displayed a muted reaction to news of the death of China &apos;s paramount leader Deng Xiaoping , taking the view that the transition of power in that country occurred long ago . 
&quot; I think in the West , Deng was largely viewed as a figurehead , &quot; said Michael Metz , chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co . &quot; It &apos;s really been several years since he faded into the background and the power there has already been passed on to others . 
U.S.-listed shares in China-related funds were little changed after the news of Deng &apos;s death . 
Templeton China World Fund Inc eased 1 / 4 to 12-7 / 8 and Jardine Fleming China Region Fund Inc was unchanged at 11-5 / 8 . 
technology shares generally outperformed the broader market on the day , helped by the release of a strong earnings report late Tuesday by Hewlett-Packard Co . 
shares in Hewlett-Packard rose 2-3 / 16 to 54-3 / 8 after the company &apos;s $ 0.87 per share fiscal first quarter earnings beat First Call &apos;s consensus analyst estimate by $ 0.12 . 
shares in several high-end computer systems makers were also strong , including Compaq Computer Corp , which rose 1-7 / 8 to 85-3 / 8 and Sun Microsystems Inc , which rose 15 / 16 to 34-11 / 16 . 
financial stocks were generally weak , edging back from their torrid run at the start of the year . 
first Union Corp slipped 3-1 / 8 to 92-1 / 2 and Bank of New York Co Inc fell 1-3 / 8 to 39-3 / 4 . 
in individual issues , Fluor Corp tumbled 13-1 / 8 to 61-7 / 8 after the engineering and construction company reported weaker than expected first quarter earnings . 
York International Corp fell six points to 44-5 / 8 after Dean Witter downgraded the shares to neutral from buy . 
first Patriot Bankshares Inc rose 1-1 / 2 to 16-1 / 4 after agreeing to be bought by United Bankshares Inc . 
United Bankshares , which agreed to pay $ 17 in cash for each First Patriot share , ended unchanged at 33-1 / 2 . 
the Nasdaq composite index fell 0.21 to 1365.58 .
