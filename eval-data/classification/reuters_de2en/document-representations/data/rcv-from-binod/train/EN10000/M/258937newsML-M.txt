better-than-expected export numbers in USDA &apos;s weekly export inspections report and cold weather in the U.S. winter wheat growing region boosted CBOT wheat futures to a higher close , traders said . 
USDA early Monday said U.S. wheat inspected for export the week ended December 12 totaled 17.157 million bushels , above trade estimates for 12 million to 16 million bushels . 
wheat also found support from cold weather in the U.S. winter wheat growing region . 
but agronomists said the cold air probably will not cause much damage to the U.S. wheat crop , despite the lack of insulating snow cover in many regions . 
wheat also was bolstered by a rumor Russia may be offered credit to buy 200,000 tonnes of wheat but talk also circulated that a Russian delegation &apos;s visit to Washington was cancelled . 
rumblings abounded early Monday about a possible renewed threat by the U.S. to reinstate the Export Enhancement Program ( EEP ) for U.S. wheat exports , traders said . 
wheat futures closed unchanged to 7-3 / 4 cents per bushel higher , with December up 7-3 / 4 at $ 4.13-3 / 4 . 
some traders cited India &apos;s recent buying of wheat on the world market as supportive because it eventually will take two million tonnes out of the world marketing pipeline . 
but others said India &apos;s purchases from countries other than the U.S. were bearish . 
India last week bought one million tonnes of wheat from Australia and the Canadian Wheat Board , according to Canadian grain trade sources , on Monday sold 250,000 tonnes of wheat to India . 
technicians cited first resistance in the March contract at $ 3.91-1 / 4 a bushel and second resistance at $ 3.95-1 / 4 . 
the session high for March was $ 3.96-1 / 2 . 
first support for March was placed by chartists at $ 3.86-3 / 4 and second support was at $ 3.82-1 / 4 . 
the session low for March was $ 3.89 . 
Chartists said the four- and 20-day moving averages for the March at Friday &apos;s close were giving off bullish signals . 
traders said Paine Webber , Refco Inc , Rand Financial prudential Securities and LIT America each bought roughly one million bushels of March . 
wheat futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 14,000 contracts , above the 13,083 contracts traded Friday . 
in wheat options , Paine Webber sold 600 May $ 4.00 calls at 8-1 / 2 cents , traders said . 
wheat options volume was estimated at 7,500 contracts , below the 8,769 traded Friday .
