tens of thousands of supporters of Ghana &apos;s President Jerry Rawlings packed the main stadium in the capital Accra on Thursday in a rally wrapping up tense campaigning for weekend presidential and legislative elections . 
scores of buses draping party flags and portraits of Rawlings ferried chanting party supporters to the 55,000 -capacity stadium which filled up well before the rally started . 
the runup to Saturday &apos;s presidential and parliamentary polls has been marred by tension and some violence . 
regional authorities banned further campaigning there . 
Rawlings , a former military ruler , is seeking a second four-year term as elected leader . 
a third candidate , surgeon Edward Mahama of the People &apos;s National Convention , is not given much of a chance and most pundits predict a close race between Rawlings and Kufuor . 
Rawlings , an airforce flight-lieutenant who took power in 1979 , restored civilian rule only to seize power again in 1981 . 
he is a crowd-puller but , as he admitted in remarks after his December cabinet scuffle , he is &quot; not much of a diplomat &quot; . 
Kufuor , 57 , is a seasoned politician , lawyer and businessman . 
he has sat in parliament and served briefly as a minister under Rawlings in 1982 . 
the opposition alliance concluded its own campaigning with a rally in Accra on Wednesday attended by about 25,000 people . 
&quot; On Saturday we are going to administer J.J. ( Rawlings ) a powerful knock-out , &quot; Kufuor told the rally . 
speaking in Twi , a main Ghanaian language , Kufuor promised jobs , peace , stability and what he called genuine democracy . 
&quot; J.J. has been on for 15 years and the masses are still suffering . 
he should step back so that the common man can also have a good breath of air , &quot; Kufuor said . 
he also repeatedly reminded the crowd that Rawlings had first come to power by a coup and not through the ballot box . 
both the NDC and the alliance claim that they will win the presidential ballot outright . 
but it is more likely that none of the three candidates will obtain more than 50 percent of votes , which would mean there will be a runoff on December 28 . 
in the 1992 presidential poll , Rawlings won 58.3 percent of votes to beat three other rivals on the first ballot . 
a Commonwealth observer group declared the election &quot; free and fair and free of fear &quot; , but the opposition accused the NDC of widespread rigging . 
the declaration of results was followed by rioting in Kumasi Sunyani and Tamale . 
four bombs exploded in Accra and Tema . 
the opposition boycotted parliamentary elections three weeks later , allowing the NDC to take 189 of the 200 seats . 
the rest went to small parties that had rallied behind Rawlings . 
Rawlings &apos; main problem is that Ghana &apos;s economic growth during a decade of painful Western-backed reforms has run out of steam since the first multiparty elections in 1992 . 
inflation has been soaring at 40 to 70 percent and unemployment is at around 35 percent .
