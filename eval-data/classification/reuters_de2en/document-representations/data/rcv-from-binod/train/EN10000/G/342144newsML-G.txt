the crime rate in France fell for the second year in a row in 1996 , Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre said on Wednesday . 
the number of registered crimes and offences fell 2.88 percent from 1995 . 
&quot; Over two years , there has been a fall of almost 10 percent in crime in France , &quot; Debre told a news conference . 
&quot; Today crime is back to a level below that of 1991 . 
while hailing the fall , he said he was worried by rising crime among the young and a high level of offences linked to drugs . 
the centre-right government has sought to stiffen sanctions while a heightened police presence in many cities after a wave of bombings by Algerian extremists in 1995 that killed eight people may have discouraged crime .
