English champions Manchester United visit Chelsea on Saturday with captain Eric Cantona suspended and goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel struggling to recover from a badly swollen ankle . 
Schmeichel has been limping as a result of a dreadful two-footed tackle from Arsenal &apos;s Ian Wright in United &apos;s 2-1 midweek win at Highbury -- a victory which kept Alex Ferguson &apos;s side a point clear at the top of the premier league . 
if the Dane fails to recover , Dutch keeper Raimond van der Gouw will step in for only his second league appearance of the season and his first since October . 
Cantona , the inspiration behind United &apos;s league and couple double last season , missed Wednesday &apos;s match through suspension and serves the second half of a two-match ban at Stamford Bridge . 
that means Norway &apos;s Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and back-in-form striker Andy Cole were likely to lead United &apos;s attack again . 
the two were partners for the first time this season at Arsenal , scoring a goal apiece . 
another good performance from Cole could cement his place in the United line-up for the first time since his 6.25 million pounds ( $ 10 million ) transfer from Newcastle in 1995 . 
midfielder Nicky Butt has been ruled out because of a serious ankle injury . 
Phil Neville , younger brother of England defender Gary , returned to Ferguson &apos;s squad after a two-month absence with glandular fever . 
he said he lost 10 kg in four days at the height of the fever but was now rapidly regaining strength . 
Chelsea return to league action following last weekend &apos;s disappointing 2-2 F.A. 
Cup draw at Leicester and their 2-0 midweek defeat in a friendly against player-manager Ruud Gullit &apos;s old side AC Milan . 
the Londoners won their last two league matches -- against Derby and Tottenham -- and in between fought back to crush Liverpool 4-2 in a dramatic F.A. 
Chelsea were expected to start with the same side that faced Leicester . 
Gianluca Vialli , who scored what turned out to be the winner against United at Old Trafford in November , has been sidelined with a bruised foot and Gianfranco Zola seemed certain to partner Welshman Mark Hughes in attack . 
history favours United . 
they won 4-1 at Chelsea last season -- their fifth victory in 10 league visits . 
but Chelsea , 12 points behind United with two games in hand , remain well aware they can beat the champions when they play to their full potential . 
they have an unparalleled record at Old Trafford where they have lost just twice in the past 22 years . 
in the premier league &apos;s other big matches , third-placed Arsenal look to breath new live into their flagging season when they entertain seventh-placed Wimbledon on Sunday . 
Newcastle , eight points off the lead with a game in hand , face bottom club Middlesbrough in the north-east derby .
