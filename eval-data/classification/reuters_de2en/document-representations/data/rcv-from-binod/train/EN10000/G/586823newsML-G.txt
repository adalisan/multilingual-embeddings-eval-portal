a maintenance worker at a Florida theme park was sucked into a high-powered turbine and decapitated as tourists splashed in a pool nearby , officials said on Thursday . 
the accident happened on Wednesday afternoon at Water mania , a winding trail of water slides and pools near Orlando , Florida , Osceola County Sheriffs Office Lt. July Rivers said . 
the worker , Henry Williams , 57 , was killed by turbine blades used to makes waves for the park &apos;s wave pool . 
&quot; It was not a pretty sight at all , &quot; Rivers said . 
although the accident happened out of sight , park officials hustled tourists away from the scene before any blood from the accident could make its way into the water system . 
water mania officials told investigators they did not know why the employee was near the turbines or how the accident happened , Rivers said . 
the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration also was investigating the accident .
