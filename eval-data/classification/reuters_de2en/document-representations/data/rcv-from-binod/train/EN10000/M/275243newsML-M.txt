storm clouds gathering over Wall Street could produce the steepest correction in years during 1997 as slower corporate earnings growth and greater market volatility weaken an ageing bull market , analysts say . 
while some analysts are calling for a real bear market in the magnitude of 20 percent plus , most crystal ball gazers see a more shallow pullback and a return to the market &apos;s more historic growth rate of eight to 10 percent . 
investors stampeded into stocks with a vengeance in 1996 , with the Dow Jones industrial average surging 27 percent -- well beyond the six to 15 percent predicted by market strategists . 
key factors that could cause problems in 1997 include a marked pickup in world economies that might spur higher interest rates and undermine stock prices and slowing U.S. corporate earnings growth . 
strategists and economists estimate that the operating earnings of Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500 companies will grow only six percent in 1997 , down from this year &apos;s seven to eight percent growth , according to First Call , a firm that tracks earnings forecasts . 
&quot; The market is high and highly valued . 
you have to pick well -- it &apos;s not like the early and mid-80s . 
you also have to be sensitive on earnings , &quot; said Marshall Acuff , portfolio strategist at Smith Barney . 
by a few historical measures , 1997 might point to a bear market . 
since 1950 the three years in which the market gained 30 percent or more -- 1954 , 1958 and 1975 -- were followed by gains that were about half the previous year &apos;s and then bear markets . 
as a double whammy , the years that have followed presidential re-elections also have proved to be bad for the market . 
in any case , some analysts suggest that the six-year old bull run may be ripe for a setback of at least 10 percent . 
a few analysts were reluctant to pinpoint targets for the 30-stock Dow index , mindful that it ran roughshod over 1995 and 1996 estimates . 
many noted that the staggering amount of money flowing into stock mutual funds --- at a rate of about $ 20 billion a month -- proved overwhelming to fundamental measures and few see the flow withering in 1997 as long as interest rates and the economic climate remain favourable . 
&quot; I don &apos;t know why we can &apos;t sustain a relatively high level ( of fund flow ) . 
the demographic forces ( of ageing baby boomers ) are pretty powerful . 
the key is if fundamentals disrupt it -- for example higher interest rates , &quot; Acuff said . 
Gail Dudack , chief investment strategist at UBS Securities , said volatility has characterised the month of December so far &quot; and in our view , volatility is here to stay . 
Michael Metz , chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co , sees a correction for next year . 
whether it &apos;s big enough for a bear market I don &apos;t know , &quot; said Metz , whose 1996 target of 4,860 for the Dow fell far short of the current 6,500 mark . 
money managers have miserably underperformed the S &amp; P 500 and have tried jumping on the bandwagon by recently snapping up &quot; safe &quot; large blue chips , such as International Business machines Corp and General Electric Co . 
but few analysts expect that sort of investment strategy will play well in 1997 as earnings growth slows . 
technology stocks will hold their magnetic appeal as premier names continue to post double-digit earnings gains . 
some smaller-name companies will also be more alluring . 
&quot; The big stocks will probably have things going against them , &quot; said Richard Cripps , chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker . 
&quot; The dollar works against them , valuations are more extended and portfolio managers are rotating to mid- and small-caps , &quot; said Cripps , who expects the Dow to range between 6,000 and 6,550 . 
Joseph Barthel , chief investment strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co , said , &quot; Despite the somewhat muted feelings of 1997 being a good year , what with the first year of a re-elected president and poison pills delivered to the economy , I think monetary policy will be very favourable in 1997 . 
&quot; Most people are not expecting a lot of disappointment but there is a &apos; one foot toward the exit door &apos; sense . 
until that becomes &apos; no one is looking for an exit , &apos; I &apos;m not concerned .
