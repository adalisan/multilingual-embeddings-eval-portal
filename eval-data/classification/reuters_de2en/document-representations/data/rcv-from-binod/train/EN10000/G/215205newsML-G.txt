Polish Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said on Monday that Poland sees membership in NATO and the European Union as inseparable . 
&quot; We do not want to separate those two issues . 
we believe , from our perspective , those are two elements of the same process of joining European transatlantic structures , &quot; Cimoszewicz told a news conference with Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen . 
&quot; We believe both ( EU and NATO ) are structures that may help us to exist in a stable and democratic Europe , &quot; Cimoszewicz said . 
Cimoszewicz and Lipponen also discussed European and Baltic security and signed an updated treaty on mutual investment . 
non-aligned Finland joined the EU alongside Sweden and Austria at the start of 1995 . 
Cimoszewicz said Poland was watching with concern its neighbour Belarus , where voters in Sunday &apos;s referendum supported a draft constitution that would expand the powers of President Alexander Lukashenko . 
&quot; We hope that all eventual changes in their constitutional system will go according to the existing constitution and existing ... procedures , &quot; Cimoszewicz said .
