driven by a tremendous influx of older Americans , Florida will have strong gains in population , employmemt and income in the next 20 years , according to a report by DRI / McGraw-Hill . 
&quot; With its warm weather , pro-business climate and relatively low cost of living , Florida will compete head to head with Texas in the coming years for a share of the large number of ageing baby boomers entering into retirement , &quot; said the forecast , released Wednesday . 
Florida is the fourth most-populous state in the nation . 
3 , behind California and Texas , over the next two decades as the U.S. population shifts from the Northeast and Midwest to the South and West . 
bolstered by population gains , Florida will be among the leaders nationally in job growth , with resident-driven services and trade employment remaining the greatest source of new jobs , the report said . 
Florida &apos;s service sector , which accounts for more than 35 percent of its employment base , is expected to grow by 4.4 percent in 1997 . business services , including computer services and temporary employment , will post an especially strong gain of 7.5 percent this year , the forecast said . 
Florida &apos;s tourism industry welcomed a record 42 million visitors to the state last year , partly because of spill-over from the Atlanta Olympics , new attractions and expanded airline flights . 
&quot; amusement , recreation and lodging services will continue to thrive as rising incomes boost domestic and international tourism , &quot; said Sara Johnson , chief regional economist for DRI / McGraw-Hill . 
the state &apos;s health services industry will see continued moderate job growth of 3 percent this year and 2.9 percent in 1998 , and will rank as one of the strongest employment sectors through the rest of the 1990s , the report said . 
manufacturing growth will increase only modestly as companies continue to trim down in response to changing market conditions and increased competition from abroad . 
however , Florida will continue to benefit from increasing trade with Latin America as a rising volume of goods passes through the Gulf of Mexico . 
the forecast said U.S. budget contraints will continue to hurt Florida &apos;s space industry and its defence contractors . 
but as many contractors move away from defence work and into consumer and commercial applications , the industry &apos;s payroll in the state will rise by 3.2 percent in 1997 , above the national industry average of 2.3 percent .
