Paraguayan goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert stole the show again in the South American World Cup qualifiers on Sunday , setting up the only goal as his team beat Ecuador 1-0 in Asuncion . 
despite putting on a few kilos in the past few weeks , the irrepressible Chilavert also made several vital saves as Ecuador pressed for an equaliser late in the game . 
the self-styled best goalkeeper in the world , who plays with a huge bulldog emblazened on his shirt and does everything possible to intimidate opponents , created the only goal with a huge clearance from his own penalty . 
he thumped the ball almost the entire length of the pitch , catching the Ecuador defence off guard and allowing striker Miguel Benitez to nip in and head the only goal of the game . 
the result put Paraguay second in the South American World Cup qualifying tournament and , with Chilavert &apos;s inspiring leadership , they appear to be in an excellent position to reach the finals for the first time since 1986 . 
Paraguay also enjoy the advantage of playing in one of the continent &apos;s most intimidating venues , a claustrophobic 45,000 capacity ground called the &quot; Defenders of the Chaco &quot; stadium where they have lost only once in the last decade . 
Chilavert , who at one stage abandoned the national team after a row with Paraguayan Football Federation ( LPF ) directors , made headlines in September when he scored from a free kick to earn Paraguay a 1-1 draw away to Argentina . 
the LPF recently invited Asuncion dog owners to take part in a competition to find a real bulldog that most resembles the one on Chilavert &apos;s shirt . 
the winner will then become the official team mascot . 
the South American competition , where all nine teams have been placed into a single group , once again provided some pulsating soccer in a stark contrast to the minnow infested European qualifiers . 
Colombia stayed top of the group after defying the high altitude of La Paz to force a 2-2 draw away to Bolivia in a passionate game which featured spectacular goals , skilful football , vicious tackles and weak refereeing . 
Bolivia , who usually make the most of the advantage of playing at 3,600 metres altitude , twice led through Marcos Sandy and Jaime Moreno but Colombia hit back with penalty by Mauricio Serna and a sublime effort from Freddy Rincon . 
Rincon had been jeered by the 45,000 crowd for a nasty challenge in the first half of a game which threatened to boil over on several occasions . 
Ecuador , who have never reached the World Cup finals , slipped to third place while Argentina , who did not play , stayed fourth . 
Argentina , however , could be overtaken if Uruguay beat Chile away on Tuesday . 
Peru , who last qualified in 1982 , won for the first time , beating Venezuela , the only real no-hopers , 4-1 in Lima with two goals from Roberto Palacios and one a-piece from captain Juan Reynoso and Brazilian-born striker Julinho . 
the top four teams qualify for France . 
Brazil are not taking part as they qualify automatically as holders .
