Taiwan &apos;s central bank issued T $ 8 billion in one-month negotiable certificates of deposit on Friday at an average yield of 5.455 percent , a central bank official said . 
the range of the bids was between 5.300 and 5.500 percent . 
the central bank repeatedly issued NCDs during a sustained stock rally in March and April , a move widely seen as aiming to keep a lid on the loose liquidity that many experts said had been fuelling what was then a sizzling stock market . 
the central bank has confirmed that it was responding to the liquidity sitution but denied that it was acting directly in response to the stock market bull run . 
the stock market entered a consolidation in May , with daily turnover plunging to less than half of the record levels set during the big first-quarter rally . 
it began to rebound since May 30 , with turnover also slowly recovering .
