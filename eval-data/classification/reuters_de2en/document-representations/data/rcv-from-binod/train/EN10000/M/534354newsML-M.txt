NYCE cotton futures closed sharply lower on selling prompted by news that demand for cotton remained weak in March , market analysts said . 
the most-active July contract ended 1.01 cents weaker at 72.44 cents per lb , having ranged from 73.44 to 72.20 cents . 
spot May closed down 0.72 cent at 70.65 cents . 
volume was estimated at 16,500 lots compared with Wednesday &apos;s official 22,920 lots . 
this morning &apos;s monthly consumption data , which put the seasonally adjusted rate at 10.480 million 480-lb bales in March compared with a revised 10.703 million bales in Feburary , surprised analysts , who had expected strong demand for cotton ahead of the summer season . 
some analysts said the report could relect rising polyester consumption at the expense of cotton , a trend that is expected to continue over the next several years . 
but Mark Lange , an economist with the National Cotton Council , called Commerce Department &apos;s report , &quot; puzzling . 
&quot; In talking to members of the spinning community , it is hard to detect a change in business that would have generated the change from the previous month , &quot; he said . 
adding weight was the U.S. Department of Agriculture &apos;s weekly export and sales data , which reported commitments for the 1996 / 97 crop at only 97,900 480-lb bales for the week ended April 17 . 
total commitments rose to 6,329,900 bales out of the 7.0 million bales forecast by the USDA .

the July contract fell through support pegged at 73.00 cents in early trade , but held over its contract low of 72.05 cents .
