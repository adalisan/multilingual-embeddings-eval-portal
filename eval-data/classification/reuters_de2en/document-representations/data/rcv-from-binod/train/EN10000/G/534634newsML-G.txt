Tino Martinez drove in five runs to take his major league-leading total to 27 and lead the New York Yankees to a 10-5 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Wednesday . 
Martinez went 2-for-3 , including a bases-clearing double in a four-run sixth inning for New York . 
&quot; Tino &apos;s terrific , &quot; said Yankees manager Joe Torre . 
&quot; He came in this year more relaxed and he feels like he belongs here . 
whether a righty or lefty is out there , he will have a quality at-bat . 
new York starter Kenny Rogers ( 2-1 ) was unable to hold the lead as a two-out , two-run triple by rookie Eddy Diaz in the sixth tied the game at 5-5 . 
but Rogers picked up the win when the Yankees scored four times in the bottom of the sixth . 
in Baltimore , Lyle Mouton delivered a sacrifice fly and Dave Martinez added an RBI single in the top of the 10th inning as the Chicago White SOx blew a seven-run lead but recovered for an 11-9 victory over the Orioles . 
the bottom four hitters in the Chicago order went 8-for-16 with nine RBI and six runs as the White SOx won for just the third time in 11 games . 
Chicago led 9-2 in the top of the sixth . 
but Baltimore tied it against starter Jaime Navarro with five runs in the seventh , capped by Eric Davis &apos;s ninth career grand slam . 
Armando Benitez ( 0-2 ) who gave up the two runs in the 10th suffered the loss . 
Tony Castillo ( 2-2 ) pitched a scoreless inning for the victory . 
in Oakland , Scott Spiezio cracked his first career grand slam and Ariel Prieto allowed one run over six innings to lead the Athletics to a 6-1 victory over the Minnesota twins . 
Prieto ( 2-0 ) gave up nine hits with three walks and three strikeouts . 
Aaron Small limited the twins to two hits over three scoreless innings for his first major league save . 
Oakland &apos;s Mark McGwire went 3-for-3 with his eighth home run of the season and two RBI . 
he has homered in four consecutive games , one shy of the club record . 
in Cleveland , Jack McDowell pitched four scoreless innings for his first win as a reliever and the Indians overcame a five-run deficit to beat the Boston Red SOx 11-7 . 
McDowell ( 1-2 ) was demoted to the bullpen Saturday after three ineffective starts . 
this was the first relief appearance in 255 career regular-season outings for McDowell . 
Boston took a 5-0 lead with a five-run third , capped by Troy O &apos;Leary &apos;s three-run double . 
Cleveland had cut the lead to 5-4 by the sixth and erupted for five runs in the seventh . 
Jim Thome went 3-for-4 with a two-run Homer and four runs scored for Cleveland . 
at Texas , pinch-hitter Mike Simms &apos;s two-out bloop single in the bottom of the ninth scored Ivan Rodriguez to lift the Rangers a 2-1 victory over the Detroit Tigers . 
Rodriguez also homered in the fourth for Texas &apos; first run . 
John Wetteland ( 1-0 ) , who blew a save in the ninth for starter Darren Oliver , notched the win . 
Oliver allowed just two third-inning hits before retiring 14 straight Tigers . 
he issued his only walk with one out in the eighth . 
Wetteland gave up a double to Damion Easley and an RBI single to Tony Clark to ruin Oliver &apos;s effort . 
in Anaheim , Jim Edmonds blasted a solo Homer run with one out in the bottom of the 10th inning as the angels overcame a four-run deficit to defeat the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 . 
Edmonds , who went 3-for-5 , belted a 3-1 pitch from Paul Spoljaric ( 0-2 ) over the right-field wall to give the angels their third win in four games . 
rich DeLucia ( 2-0 ) pitched three scoreless innings of relief to earn his second win in three days . 
Toronto &apos;s Ed Sprague went 4-for-5 with two doubles and has seven hits in his last nine at-bats . 
in Seattle , David Howard capped a sixth-run fifth inning with his first Homer of the season and Jeff King added a solo shot as the Kansas City Royals outslugged the mariners 12-10 . 
Howard also doubled , drove in two runs and scored twice for the Royals . 
Seattle &apos;s Ken Griffey Jr. went 2-for-4 with a solo Homer -- his 10th of the month , which is one shy of the major-league mark for home runs in April . 
Randy Veres ( 1-0 ) , the third Kansas City pitcher , got the win . 
Edwin Hurtado ( 1-1 ) took the loss .
