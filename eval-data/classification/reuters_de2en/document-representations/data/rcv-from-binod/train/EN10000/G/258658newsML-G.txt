President Ong Teng Cheong dissolved Singapore &apos;s parliament on Monday , setting the stage for general elections that the ruling People &apos;s Action Party ( PAP ) was expected to win with ease . 
a government announcement did not say when the elections would be held , but Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said at the weekend that he expected to decide dates after &quot; smelling the air &quot; in an opposition-held constituency on Sunday . 
elections must be held by April and Goh has three months after the dissolution of parliament to call them . 
former prime minister Lee Kwan Yew said at the weekend that the polls would be held in the next few weeks . 
political analysts say they expect polls in early January . 
in the last elections in 1991 , Goh &apos;s PAP , which has won every election since 1959 , won all but four of the 81 elected seats in parliament . 
the anlaysts said the most closely watched aspect of the polls would be the percentage of the vote won by the PAP , whose share slipped to 61 percent in the last elections from 63.2 percent in 1988 . 
opposition parties say they expect to put up about 40 candidates this time and hope to win at least 10 seats . 
they advocate a kinder , gentler government than that provided by the firm hand of the PAP . 
however , the PAP argues that its style of government has brought huge wealth to Singapore , where per capita Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) is higher than in Britain , the former colonial power , and influence beyond its size .
