Toronto stocks were expected to extend their gains at the open on Friday after U.S. economic data again came in below market expectations , but analysts said week &apos;s end profit-taking may dampen the climb . 
&quot; What tends to happen on a Friday afternoon , ( is ) some profit-taking does set in . 
I mean they &apos;ve had such a great run , it wouldn &apos;t be surprising to see it pop higher at the open and then pull back slightly , &quot; said technical analyst Katherine Beattie mms International . 
she said this morning &apos;s lower-than-expected U.S. Producer Price Index should once again boost bank stocks . 
U.S. PPI fell 0.3 percent in May from April , below forecasts from Wall Street economists of a 0.1 percent rise . 
the data , which came on the heels of Thursday &apos;s lower-than-expected U.S. retail sales data , lessens the likelihood that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike U.S. interest rates at its July 1-2 meeting . 
the easing of inflation fears helped the Toronto Stock Exchange to its 17th record close of the year on Thursday . 
new York soared for a fifth straight day , vaulting over the 7700 level with a jump of 136 points . 
* eased inflation concerns should help banks and interest-sensitive stocks to another strong day .
