Bulgaria &apos;s cabinet on Thursday approved draft amendments to the foreign investment law extending tax benefits to foreign investors in a bid to speed up privatisation , a government official said . 
&quot; The amendments are aimed at creating a more favourable business climate for foreign investors and attracting more investors in the future , &quot; Economy Minister Roumen Gechev told reporters after a cabinet meeting . 
under the amendments no Value Added Tax , customs duties and other taxes will be levied on non-fiscal foreign investments like machines and equipment , patent rights , licences , trademarks , technologies and know-how for five years after a joint venture is set up . 
the tax holiday will apply when the foreign investment makes up at least 30 percent of the company &apos;s capital and is worth no less than than the Lev equivalent of $ 100,000 , Gechev said . 
&quot; The amendments give guarantees to foreign investors that their status and investments will not suffer in case of future changes in Bulgaria &apos;s legislation , &quot; Gechev said . 
under the amendments , foreign investments will be given preferential treatment up to 10 years after their registration in Bulgaria irrespective of possible legislative curbs that might come into force during that period , Gechev added . 
&quot; This will safeguard foreign businessmen against future changes in legislation that might be unfavourable for them , &quot; said Gechev . 
he said the draft amendments were expected to be tentatively approved by parliament in two weeks &apos; time and would pass their final reading within two months . 
Bulgaria has less foreign investment than many of its ex-communist neighbours . 
last year , Bulgaria attracted around $ 90 million direct investments from abroad . 
direct foreign investment in the first quarter of this year totalled $ 60 million .
