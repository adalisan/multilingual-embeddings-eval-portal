Zimbabwe will not get any immediate funding from the International Monetary Fund for a five-year economic reform programme it plans to launch this year , a senior IMF official said on Monday . 
Michael Nowak , division chief for the IMF Southern African Department , said President Robert Mugabe &apos;s government might , however , get some aid in the financial year starting next July after showing progress and providing details on how it intended to fight runaway state spending and a big budget deficit . 
&quot; The IMF is ready to assist once this area has been addressed , &quot; Nowak told a news conference in Harare . 
&quot; The process is long ... and I think we should be looking at mid-1997 , in the new financial year , &quot; he said to queries on when Harare -- which government officials and economic analysts say is desperate for IMF and World Bank aid -- could get assistance for its new five-year Zimbabwe Programme for Economic and Social Transformation ( ZIMPREST ) . 
other key Western donors , including Britain and Germany , say they will take their lead from the IMF and the World Bank on supporting ZIMPREST , which promises to lift Zimbabwe &apos;s economic growth to five percent annually from an average one percent posted yearly between 1990 and 1995 . 
John Robertson , a leading Zimbabwean economic consultant , and other local analysts said last month Zimbabwe was facing hard talks on winning support for the reform programme because it had made little progress on government spending and its budget deficit . 
&quot; There is widespread recognition of the seriousness of the fiscal situation facing the government , &quot; the IMF &apos;s Nowak said on Monday . 
he said the IMF would like the government to make progress in cutting the budget deficit to 8.6 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) by next June from 10.1 percent in the last financial year . 
many Zimbabwean economic analysts believe the deficit may actually balloon to around 12 percent following the government &apos;s recent award of 20 percent pay rises to civil servants after a crippling three-week strike in September . 
&quot; The civil servants &apos; pay rise has exacerbated the botton line , &quot; the IMF official said , saying the government &apos;s wage bill of over 30 percent of GDP was twice the international average . 
acting Public Service , Labour and Social Welfare Minister Nathan Shamuyarira said on Monday Zimbabwe &apos;s wage bill accounted for 49 percent of GDP , and Nowak said the government had plans to cut the civil service . 
the government has been battling a second nurses and doctors &apos; pay strike for three weeks . 
it says it is ready to look at their grievances but will not submit to pressure . 
Nowak said the government should also demonstrate greater commitment to free market principles , saying Mugabe &apos;s recent remarks denouncing the IMF and the World Bank as &quot; economic dictators &quot; were regrettable . 
the World Bank and the IMF cut some financial support to Zimbabwe in 1995 when the government failed to implement cost-saving measures .
