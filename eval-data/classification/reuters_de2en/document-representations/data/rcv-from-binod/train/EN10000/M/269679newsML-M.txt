the U.S. corporate bond market experienced a day of very little activity on Friday , as many Wall Street players had their minds more on the upcoming holidays than on corporate bonds , traders said . 
in the high-yield market , however , investors showed some interst in the supermarket and the telecommunications and cable sector early in the day . 
supermarket bond from Ralphs supermarkets , Brunos Inc and Grand Union Co closed 1 / 2 a point higher on Friday . 
in the telecommuncations and cable sector , traders said Nextel Communication Inc bonds also saw better bids . 
analysts suspected that much of the buying came from accounts looking to stock portfolios with liquid , higher-coupon bonds as the new year approaches . 
new issue activity was also quiet on Friday . 
a unit of Mellon Bank was one of the only issuers to tap the primary market , selling $ 500 million in capital securities with a 7.995 percent coupon at a spread of 137.5 basis points over treasuries . 
the deal , rated A2 by Moody &apos;s Investors Service and BBB-plus by Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s , was priced via a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co-led syndicate . 
spreads on both high-yield and investment-grade bonds ended the day largely unchanged to treasuries , traders said . 
the 30-year benchmark Treasury dropped 8 / 32 to close at 98-20 / 32 . 
the yield rose to 6.61 percent .
