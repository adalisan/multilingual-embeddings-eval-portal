the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR appealed to Zaire on Wednesday to reverse its decision to expel 40 aid workers it accused of precipitating an alleged slaughter by pulling out of the area . 
spokesman Fernando del Mundo said UNHCR was negotiating with authorities to reverse the expulsions , which include five of its staff . 
they stand accused of triggering the alleged slaughter of 25,000 Rwandan Hutus and displaced Zairians by mainly Tutsi rebels in the east . 
the aid workers withdrew from the eastern city of Kisangani at the weekend on security grounds . 
unconfirmed reports from the region said on Wednesday the rebels were surrounding the city . 
the rebels overran eastern Zaire &apos;s biggest refugee area of Tingi-Tingi on Friday , sending more than 170,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees fleeing , according to UNHCR . 
del Mundo said UNHCR had no information on any massacres by rebels in Tingi-Tingi . 
he said some of the refugees were heading towards Kisangani , 240 km ( 150 miles ) northwest of Tingi-Tingi , according to information from overflights . 
several hundred others were heading east towards Rwanda . 
UNHCR said it did not know the whereabouts of the remaining refugees scattered across the region , and that it was in talks with the rebels regarding the prospect of securing humanitarian corridors to allow the refugees to walk back towards Rwanda . 
Zaire has accused the regular armies of Rwanda , Uganda and Burundi of supporting the almost five-month-old rebellion in eastern Zaire and of actively participating in fighting on Zairian soil . 
all three countries deny the allegations . 
the refugees include members of Hutu militia and Rwanda &apos;s former government army responsible for the 1994 Rwanda genocide of more than half a million Tutsis and Hutu moderates . 
if the malnourished refugees trek east towards home across rebel-controlled territory , it would take them a long time to reach Rwanda . 
if they head deeper west into the Zairian bush , aid officials fear many will die from starvation and disease . 
the government said it had ordered the expulsion of about 40 U.N. and non-governmental organisation ( NGO ) workers after the weekend pullout saying that it had triggered the slaughter by rebels of thousands of Hutu refugees and displaced Zaireans . 
there has been no independent confirmation of any such slaughter . 
the U.N. sources said some of the expelled workers would remain across the River Zaire from Kinshasa in Congo &apos;s capital Brazzaville pending the result of negotiaations . 
NGO representatives said that none of their staff had been individually ordered to leave , adding that they suspected the Zairean authorities wanted to put the spotlight on the United Nations .
