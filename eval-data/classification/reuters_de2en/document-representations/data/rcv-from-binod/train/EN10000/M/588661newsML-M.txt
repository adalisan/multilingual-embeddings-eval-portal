Taiwan share prices were lower in late trading , but well recovered from a sharp midsession downturn that coincided with the start of President Lee Teng-hui &apos;s annual news conference . 
with an hour of trading to go , the index was at 8,156.90 points , down 0.30 percent or 24.66 points but well recovered from a midmorning dip of 2.11 a quarter of an hour earlier . 
brokers attributed the rebound to aggressive and obvious intervention by government-related funds , noting that the most heavily weighted sector , financials , was up significantly while most other sectors , particularly electronics , were well lower . 
&quot; It is obvious that the government does not want to see a plunge and is boosting the market through state-backed funds , &quot; said Chen Han-chung , an analyst at Yungli Securities . 
brokers said they and Taiwan investors were transfixed by the live television broadcast of President Lee &apos;s news conference , looking for signals about a crisis of confidence arising from a perceived breakdown of law and order . 
Lee opened his remarks by affirming that embattled Premier LIEN Chan , the focus of intense opposition and public criticism in the public order debate , could resign upon completion of constitutional reforms in July . 
Lee also offered his personal apology for what he called &quot; problems of social order &quot; , a comment that market watchers , speaking ahead of the news conference , had said could help to strengthen investor confidence in the jitter stock market . 
brokers cautioned that Lee &apos;s comments had yet to be fully reflected in the market .
