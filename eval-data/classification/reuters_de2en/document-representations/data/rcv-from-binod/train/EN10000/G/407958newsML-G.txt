a violent earthquake jolted Pakistan &apos;s southwestern province of Baluchistan early on Friday and there could be many casualties , officials and residents said . 
an official at a seismic centre in Peshawar described the earthquake as &quot; violent &quot; but could not immediately give its strength on the international Richter scale . 
the civil hospital in the Baluchistan province capital Quetta had begun receiving injured people , doctors said . 
the quake struck Quetta at 2 : 10 a.m. ( 2110 GMT Thursday ) and continued shaking the city for half a minute . 
almost the entire city population woke up and came out of their homes in the dark as electricity broke down , residents said . 
&quot; First there was a mild tremor , then it became very severe and it sounded as though a tractor was running outside , &quot; one resident said .
