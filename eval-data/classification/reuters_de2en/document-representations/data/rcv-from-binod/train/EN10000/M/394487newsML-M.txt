French bond futures remained hemmed in between two strong areas of support and resistance on Friday to trade in narrow range throughout a lacklustre session . 
traders said a lack of major events at the beginning of next week pointed to a similar pattern on Monday although there was a risk the gap left between 131.96 and 132.08 would be filled . 
the March bond future settled unchanged at 132.26 , bouncing of 132.08 early in the session and running out of steam at 132.34 , the lower boundary of a gap up to 132.42 . 
PIBOR contracts were equally range bound , March settling up one basis point and June down one basis point . 
the French Treasury continued to eat into its financing programme for 1997 at a heady pace , selling an extra 3.38 billion francs of the new five-year benchmark it first put on sale yesterday . 
the extra BTAN sales took the total amount raised to 27.195 billion francs , well above the 22 to 24 billion francs the Treasury initially planned to raise this week . 
analysts said the Treasury would probably continue with this aggressive start to &quot; frontload &quot; its issuance ahead of large redemptions later in the year , notably the outstanding 90 billion francs of the Balladur bond due for redemption in July . 
the franc was steady at 3.3772 against the mark compared with 3.3771 . 
against the dollar it was steady at 5.6857 compared 5.6855 . 
call money was unchanged 3-1 / 8 1 / 4 percent .
