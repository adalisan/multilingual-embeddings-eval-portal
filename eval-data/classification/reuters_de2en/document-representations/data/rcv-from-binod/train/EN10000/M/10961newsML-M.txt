Uganda &apos;s export earnings fell by nearly 4.0 percent in the financial year to June 30 because of weak world prices for its key coffee exports , the Finance Ministry said on Friday . 
export revenue fell to $ 555.3 million in 1995 / 96 from $ 577.5 million the year before , the ministry said in a report . 
&quot; The major factor behind the decline in overall exports was the sharp drop in the world prices of coffee , after more than doubling between the period 1993 / 94 and 1994 / 95 , &quot; it said . 
&quot; The big increase in the volume of coffee exports of about 32.5 percent in 1995 / 96 over the previous year was not enough to compensate fully for the fall in prices , &quot; it added . 
Uganda &apos;s coffee exports in 1995 / 96 rose to 3.84 million 60-kg ( 132 lb ) bags from 2.89 million in the previous year due to better weather and the maturing of a new prolific coffee type planted three years ago , according to official records . 
but low world prices meant coffee exports fetched only $ 392.61 million in 1995 / 96 , compared with $ 442.16 million in 1994 / 95 , the records showed . 
despite this , coffee contributed a high 70.0 percent of Uganda &apos;s total export revenues , even though this was down from 76.6 percent the year before , the ministry said . 
Uganda has been trying to boost other exports like cotton , tea , tobacco and flowers to make its reviving economy less dependent on world coffee prices . 
in 1995 / 96 , rising export earners included fish , second only to coffee , and bringing in $ 29.88 million , up from $ 16.99 million in 1994 / 95 , the report said . 
other key exports were cotton , $ 12.16 million ; hides and skins , $ 9.65 million ; tobacco , $ 9.24 million ; tea , $ 8.75 million , cereals $ 7.71 million and beans $ 6.73 million . 
the government is trying to promote exports of vanilla , flowers , oil seeds , cocoa , animal skins , silkworm and tropical fruits as an alternative to the &quot; traditional &quot; export crops . 
but production of these remains low , and economists say it will be a long time before they make a serious contribution . 
coffee is expected to dominate this year &apos;s exports too . 
industry analysts say coffee exports for the current crop year ( October-September ) , will rise to 3.8 million bags from 2.76 million in the last year , and could climb to 4.2 million bags in 1996 / 97 , they say .
