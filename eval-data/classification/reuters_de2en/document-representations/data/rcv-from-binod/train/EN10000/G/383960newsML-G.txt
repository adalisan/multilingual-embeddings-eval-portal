the South African Rugby Football Union ( SARFU ) said on Tuesday it would refuse to co-operate with a government team appointed to investigate the game &apos;s affairs unless the group &apos;s composition were changed . 
&quot; We feel it is inappropriate to have representatives from other sporting codes probing into SARFU matters , &quot; SARFU chief executive Rian Oberholzer said in a press release . 
&quot; We will not accept the task force appointed by Mr Tshwete . 
SARFU object to the presence of a representative of the National Olympic Committee of South Africa ( NOCSA ) in the task force which was scheduled to start its work on Friday . 
Oberholzer added : &quot; We are happy to work with Mr Tshwete and officials from the department of sport and recreation and resolve his concerns but we would insist that the allegations be presented to us and then that SARFU be given the chance to answer them .
