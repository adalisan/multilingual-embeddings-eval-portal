copper prices remained steady by 1900 GMT , underpinned by tight nearby spreads and a backdrop of an offtake in consumer demand . 
the market had largely factored in an expected rise in ME inventories of between 5,000 and 8,000 tonnes on Tuesday . 
cash to three months backwardation came out some $ 15 to $ 315 / $ 320 , while earlier cash for a day moved up to $ 23 / $ 24 as the first of the tight dates , January 29 , came into play . 
the LME has imposed a limit of one percent of cash , which on Monday was $ 25 . 
the market was focusing on whether shorts would cover or roll over and thereby how much the spreads would lose steam as the tight dates became prompt . 
three months last at $ 2,248 , little changed from earlier levels and up around $ 2 from Friday &apos;s kerb close . 
aluminium was also stable at $ 1,640
