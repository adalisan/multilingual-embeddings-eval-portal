Portugal &apos;s consumer prices rose less than predicted in January , strengthening confidence in the government &apos;s 1997 goal of getting inflation down below the limit for entry to monetary union . 
the National Statistics Institute ( INE ) reported that the consumer price index ( CPI ) rose 0.3 percent month-on-month in January , against a 0.1 percent rise in December , while the year-on-year rate was unchanged at 3.3 percent . 
but analysts had feared that the month-on-month rate could go as high as 0.8 percent in January when the government adjusts centrally-administered prices such as public transport and telephones . 
&quot; The CPI ( in January ) showed that there are no inflationary tensions in the economy and , in the coming months , the year-on-year rate is going to fall slightly , &quot; said analyst Martin Amaral Neto of Banco ESSI . 
the government forecasts that inflation , as measured by a rolling 12-month average , will fall to 2.25-2.50 percent by the end of the year from 3.2 percent in January . 
according to a Finance Ministry study , a copy of which was obtained by Reuters , the average rate will peak at 3.3 percent in March before beginning a slow decline to reach the 2.5 percent in December . 
&quot; It was a very promising start to the year , &quot; said economist Isabel Cabral of brokers Fincor about the January figures . 
&quot; By the end of the year , I continue to believe that an average rate of 2.5 percent is achievable . 
analysts said that they expected a sharp reduction in the year-on-year rate around the middle of the year , with the figure possibly even dropping below two percent , as the impact on prices of last year &apos;s mad cow disease scare works its way out of the system . 
&quot; We think that in May , the CPI ( year-on-year ) could break two percent and go to 1.9 percent , &quot; said analyst Nuno Godinho of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
but some analysts warned that it was important to know the pace of non-tradable goods prices , basically wages , before coming to clear conclusions on the inflation trend . 
non-tradable goods prices rose 4.9 percent in December but no breakdown has been issued yet for January . 
&quot; We still need to know about non-tradable goods . 
tradable goods prices are in line with the rest of Europe but it is the non-tradable that is important , &quot; said Rui Martins dos Santos , chief economist at Banco Portugues de Investimento . 
nevertheless , analysts said that they did not expect the Bank of Portugal to cut interest rates on Tuesday when it announced conditions for the next commercial bank reserve period . 
the main reason why the Bank was expected to be cautious was the recent volatility on the foreign exchange market where the escudo , along with the Spanish peseta , has lost ground on the German mark .
