the Singapore dollar firmed against the dollar on Monday after Singapore &apos;s Trade Development Board ( TDB ) released better-than-expected March non-oil domestic exports figures . 
according to the TDB , Singapore &apos;s non-oil domestic exports fell a nominal 2.1 percent year-on-year in March to Singapore $ 7.67 billion against a 7.9 percent drop in February . 
the figures were better than a Reuter &apos;s forecast of an average drop of 4.5 percent in nominal terms , fuelling dealers hope for an economic recovery in the second-half of 1997 . 
after trading to a low of 1.4415 to the dollar , the Singapore dollar firmed to 1.4385 against the greenback at 0500 GMT after the release of the non-oil exports data . 
the Singapore dollar was expected to hover around 1.4370 / 80 to the dollar in the afternoon , according to Andy Tan , general manager and economist at mms International Ltd . 
&quot; We see scope for the dollar / sing to test 1.4370 / 80 level , &quot; Tan told Reuters . 
&quot; If broken , the next support for the Singapore dollar will be at 1.4320 to the dollar , &quot; he said . 
tan felt it unlikely the Singapore dollar would firm beyond 1.4320 against the greenback . 
&quot; The trade figures were better than expected but not to the extent that would justify that kind of firmness , &quot; he said , adding that 1.4320 had been tested and sustained on numerous occasions . 
TDB said in a statement the decline in exports was largely due to continuing problems in the electronics industry , which accounts for half of Singapore &apos;s manufacturing output and close to 60 percent of its non-oil exports . 
the decrease was reflected in domestic exports of disk drives , computer parts and other electronics peripherals .
