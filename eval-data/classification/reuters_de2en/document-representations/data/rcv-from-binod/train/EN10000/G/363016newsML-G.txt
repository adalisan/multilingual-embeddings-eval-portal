the health of Croatian President Franjo Tudjman , reported to be ill with cancer , is satisfactory and enables him to fully perform his duties for a long time , a council of Croatian and Western medical experts said on Friday . 
&quot; The council diagnosed stomach disorders have ceased and lymph nodes in the stomach have considerably diminished , &quot; the Council &apos;s statement , carried by state news agency Hina , said . 
the council , including doctors from Paris-based &quot; Gustave Roussy &quot; Institute , as well as German and U.S. experts said : &quot; The current health condition of the President , after the successful treatment , enables a full working capacity , for a long time and with no restraints &quot; . 
U.S. sources previously said Tudjman , 74 , had inoperable stomach cancer and diplomats said worsening health could force him to give up his duties in a matter of months . 
State media played down the seriousness of the president &apos;s condition during his treatment at a U.S. hospital last November , and discribed it as stomach ulcer . 
in a recent interview to CNN television , Tudjman admitted he was ill , but denied he had cancer and said he would run for his third time in office in presidential election due this year .
