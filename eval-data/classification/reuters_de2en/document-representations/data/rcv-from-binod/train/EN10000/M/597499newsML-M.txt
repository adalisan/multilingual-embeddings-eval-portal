Czech blue chips plunged on Tuesday pulling the PX50 index down 2.8 percent to 489.6 with dealers blaming continued uncertainty in the foreign exchange markets and saying further declines were to be expected . 
the crown strengthened on Tuesday to minus 1.61 percent against the mid-point of its mark / dollar basket from arond 2.8 percent the day before . 
however , dealers said that uncertainty was likely to continue to affect Czech shares even if the central bank successfully defended the crown against the current attack from foreign speculators . 
&quot; I see the CNB ( central bank ) winning the battle but at the expense of companies being able to borrow money short term ... Probably after two weeks , interest rates have got to go down and we find ourselves back in the same situation . 
I don &apos;t think these guys are one shot investors , &quot; said Radek Vavra of Citicorp Securities . 
the brunt of the losses were bourne by highly capitalised shares , especially SPT Telecom , which fell nearly six percent to 3,005 and Komercni Banka which dropped 5.3 percent to 1,770 .
