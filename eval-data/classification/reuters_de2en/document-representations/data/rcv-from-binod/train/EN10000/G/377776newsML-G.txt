Budapest &apos;s Chinese community had donated two cars to the city &apos;s police force to help in its efforts to combat a crime wave which has seen the deaths of four Chinese in the last two weeks . 
&quot; The Chinese have given us the donation to pass on to the police fund , &quot; Chinese Embassy spokesman Wu Wan Liang told Reuters on Friday . 
four Chinese have been killed in Budapest in the last two weeks . 
a fortnight ago a hand grenade attack killed the wife and daughter of a Chinese restaurant owner , while two Chinese men have been found murdered in their homes within the last seven days . 
Wu said neither the police nor the embassy had any clues as to who committed the attacks . 
&quot; There is absolutely no lead we can give , &quot; he said . 
since last September , Budapest has been shaken by a score of bombings and at least a half dozen shootings in an apparent gangland war , which previously had affected only Hungarians . 
in the latest incident , police in Eastern Hungary arrested the owner of a prostitution ring who threw a petrol bomb at a village reataurant , whose owner had refused to allow hin the girls to enter his premises . 
no-one was hurt in the incident .
