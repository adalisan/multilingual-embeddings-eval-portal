Michael Jordan scored 26 points as the undefeated Chicago bulls continued their best start ever with a 97-79 win over the winless Phoenix suns on Monday . 
Dennis Rodman grabbed 22 rebounds and Scottie Pippen scored 18 points for the bulls , who shook off a sluggish first half and improved to 7-0 . 
Chicago won six of its first seven games last season en route to a record-setting 72-10 mark and their fourth NBA title . 
&quot; mentally we &apos;re better than last year , &quot; said Jordan , who scored 17 points after halftime . 
Michael Finley had 17 points for the suns ( 0-6 ) , who are off to their worst start in 11 years and are one of three winless teams . 
&quot; It &apos;s real special to come here and play in my hometown , &quot; Finley said . 
we knew we had to come in here and respect the world champions . 
and they are famous for their third-quarter runs . 
they did us in that way tonight . 
the suns led 43-41 at halftime and still held a 47-46 edge with 8 : 47 to go in the third quarter . 
but Phoenix managed just two baskets by Sam Cassell over the next 7 1 / 2 minutes . 
&quot; It appears right now we play better coming from behind , &quot; Jordan said . 
&quot; We have been taking care of business , but it &apos;s a dangerous way to live . 
Chicago shot 43 percent ( 39-of-90 ) from the field but committed just 11 turnovers . 
&quot; It was cold in the building here tonight and it was a tough night for us shooting the ball , &quot; Pippen said . 
&quot; We &apos;re not really putting a string of runs together right now . 
hopefully that will come with better execution . 
phoenix shot 39 percent ( 29-of-74 ) and had 18 turnovers , leading to 19 Chicago points . 
in Salt Lake City , the game between the San Antonio spurs and Utah Jazz was postponed as the cold ice surface of the Delta Centre warped plastic rods connecting sections of the hardwood floor . 
official Jess Kersey decided to postpone the game 50 minutes after the scheduled start . 
Kersey spoke with Jazz officials and consulted with NBA vice president of operations Rod Thorn before postponing the game . 
&quot; There &apos;s no way that the floor is playable tonight and for the safety of the players in our league , we feel like it &apos;s necessary to cancel the game , &quot; Kersey said . 
according to a statement from the Jazz , Delta Centre maintenance personnel noticed Monday morning that portions of the floor were rising . 
they were sanded and treated with varnish , but Kersey decided that the court was not drying quickly enough . 
&quot; There &apos;s too many gaps in the floor and it &apos;s raised too high , &quot; Kersey said . 
&quot; If a player were to go down , it &apos;s a possibility of him cutting a leg , cutting an arm and that &apos;s something that we don &apos;t want to do . 
the Jazz have two home games this week and will use the old floor from last season . 
the game was rescheduled for December 15 . 
&quot; You know it is a break for us , &quot; spurs coach Bob Hill said . 
&quot; It would be a break for anybody that &apos;s got a lot of injuries that goes in to play a game and especially as beat up as we are . 
San Antonio is without All-Star centre David Robinson and forwards Chuck person and Will Perdue . 
forward Charles Smith sprained an ankle Sunday night and is questionable . 
in Sacramento , Shawn Kemp scored 16 of his 31 points in the first quarter and Gary Payton added 21 as the Seattle SuperSonics completed a perfect three-game road trip with a 110-94 victory over the Kings . 
Kemp added nine rebounds and Payton handed out nine assists for Seattle , which defeated the Kings for the fifth straight time . 
Mitch Richmond scored 28 points for Sacramento . 
in Toronto , Dale Ellis scored 21 of his season-high 37 points in the first half , when the Denver nuggets raced to a 19-point lead before holding on for a 104-93 victory over the raptors . 
Ellis shot 15-of-21 from the field , including 6-of-11 from beyond the three-point arc . 
the NBA &apos;s all-time leader in three-pointers has led the nuggets in scoring four times in seven games . 
rookie Marcus Camby , making his first NBA start , scored 20 of his season-high 26 points in the second half for the raptors , who had a two-game winning streak snapped .
