Papua New Guinea ( PNG ) officials said on Sunday that about 300 people had left the town of Rabaul since Friday after one of two active volcanoes erupted , spewing ash 4,000 metres into the air and opening a new lava chasm . 
&quot; They were given advice to move but they also moved on their own account because of the noise , &quot; national disaster and emergency services director leith Anderson told Reuters . 
&quot; It was rather frightening , apparently , &quot; he said . 
Rabaul , a port town located on New Britain Island 800 km ( 500 miles ) northeast of the PNG capital Port Moresby , was devastated in September 1994 , when the two volcanoes on either side of the picturesque town erupted , forcing the evacuation of its 30,000 residents . 
five people died in the 1994 evacuation and during attempts to return to the town over the next few days to rescue belongings from gangs of looters . 
an earthquake measuring 6.2 on the open-ended Richter scale shook Rabaul in August last year . 
there was another eruption last May which Anderson said was more severe than Friday &apos;s rumbling . 
Anderson described Friday &apos;s eruption at the Tavurvur volcano as moderately active . 
it lasted nearly three hours and led to the evacuation of some residents from Matupit Island , close to the town &apos;s former airstrip . 
&quot; There was a major lava flow which occurred about one kilometre ( 0.63 miles ) along from the eastern side of the volcano which hadn &apos;t been there before , &quot; Anderson said . 
&quot; It was still flowing about two hours ago but not as fast as it was originally , &quot; he said .
