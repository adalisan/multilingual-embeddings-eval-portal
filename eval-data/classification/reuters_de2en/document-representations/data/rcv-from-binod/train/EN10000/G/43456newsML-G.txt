tens of thousands of victims of Bosnia &apos;s ethnic cleansing will have the chance to return home this week , but only for a few hours at the most . 
under a deal agreed between Moslems , Croats and Serbs , the refugees will be bussed in to vote in countrywide elections this Saturday in districts from which they were driven out during the 3-1 / 2 year war . 
but far from showing how the wounds of war are slowly healing , the plan -- backed by an uneasy international community worried about its segregationist overtones -- has highlighted how deeply split the country still remains . 
those taking up the offer will not be allowed to take any possessions with them . 
most will not even get a glimpse of their old homes . 
in a joint statement , the interior ministers of the Bosnian Serb Republic and Moslem-Croat Federation said on Monday they had agreed to 19 &quot; voters &apos; routes &quot; across ethnic boundary lines on which full security would be ensured . 
critics say the deal shows how little freedom of movement , a key element of the Dayton peace accords , really exists and underlines their argument that the poll will feed desires to make existing divisions permanent . 
NATO , the United Nations , and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) which is supervising the September 14 poll were at pains on Tuesday to stress the deal did not conflict with Dayton . 
spokesmen insisted other routes across inter-ethnic boundary lines would remain open and people would be free to use them with their own vehicles if they wished , but admitted security could not then be guaranteed . 
&quot; We are clear that the normal rules of the road would apply along the whole length of inter-ethnic boundary line on voting day , &quot; NATO spokesman Major Simon Haselock told reporters . 
&quot; It ( the plan ) did not close any roads , it simply designated 19 roads as recommended for use by voters and it spelled out the most efficient way to use them . 
their plan is an attempt to help voters vote , &quot; he added . 
up to 100,000 Moslems may return to Serb-held Bosnia . 
far fewer Serbs are expected to come into the territory of the Moslem-Croat Federation . 
even if they do , they will have little to vote for as the Bosnian Serbs are running candidates only in their own areas -- further underlining the country &apos;s ethnic split . 
Bosnian Serb Interior Minister Dragan Kijac told journalists the intention of the deal was to allow people to go and vote . 
he said they should come straight back to allow another group of people to use the same bus . 
&quot; Any operation does require certain prohibitions from a football match to Olympic games . 
citizens can not do what they want , their rights are being limited , &quot; Kijac said . 
the United Nations distanced itself from that remark , saying no pressure would be put on people who after voting decided to go and look at their old homes , even if this meant &quot; missing the bus back &quot; . 
&quot; The U.N. is not going to prevent anyone going to see their house , &quot; Alex Ivanko , spokesman for the International Police Task Force , said on Tuesday . 
privately , however , representatives of the international community say this is most unlikely . 
&quot; polling stations are in the district , but not necessarily near their homes . 
those taking up the offer will be those who want to make a point by voting in their old areas , &quot; said one official . 
&quot; Missing the bus is a hell of an incentive to leave . 
OSCE supervisors also back the deal despite worries over party control of the buses . 
they fear widespread unrest in an an unsupervised mass movement of voters could wreck the polls .
