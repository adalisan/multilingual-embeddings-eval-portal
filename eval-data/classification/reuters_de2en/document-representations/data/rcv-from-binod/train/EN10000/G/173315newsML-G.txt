President Farooq Leghari sacked the government of Pakistan &apos;s most industrialised province on Thursday as tremors from the dismissal of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto reverberated through the political system . 
acting on Leghari &apos;s order , the governor of the southern province of Sindh , Kamal Azfar , dissolved the local parliament and dismissed the government , his spokesman said in Karachi . 
Bhutto &apos;s ancestral home is in Sindh , where the financial capital Karachi is located . 
Karachi , with a population of more than 12 million , has been torn by sectarian violence . 
the Sindh governor named Mumtaz Bhutto , an estranged uncle of Bhutto , as the troubled province &apos;s caretaker chief minister . 
the interim chief minister will replace Abdullah Shah of Bhutto &apos;s Pakistan People &apos;s Party ( PPP ) , whose dismissal came two days after his party &apos;s leader was removed by Leghari on disputed charges of corruption and misrule . 
Mumtaz , an opposition deputy in the dissolved assembly , is the first cousin of Bhutto &apos;s father , executed former prime minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto . 
Azfar &apos;s spokesman said the reasons for the dismissal of the Sindh assembly were similar to those cited by Leghari on Tuesday in a scathing order sacking Bhutto . 
Leghari had justified his dismissal of Bhutto &apos;s government on the grounds that it was paralysed by corruption , nepotism and misrule and had allowed security forces to kill &quot; thousands of people &quot; in Karachi and elsewhere . 
the president , once an ally of Benazir Bhutto , was expected to dissolve the governments of the three other provinces . 
the ousting of the local assemblies would clear the way for elections to both the federal and provincial legislatures in early 1997 . 
Leghari has asked caretaker prime minister Meraj Khalid to step up a fight against corruption . 
share prices on the Karachi stock exchange soared on Wednesday after Bhutto was sacked as investors anticipated a serious anti-corruption drive . 
but prices fell back sharply on Thursday after Moody &apos;s Investors Service downgraded Pakistan &apos;s credit ratings . 
Leghari has set general elections for February 3 , but a pledge by Bhutto to fight her dismissal in court has added uncertainty to the timetable . 
Bhutto met her detained husband Asif Ali Zardari in the early hours of Thursday for the first time since her dismissal two days earlier , her spokesman said . 
the spokesman , Shah Mahmood Qureshi , said Bhutto had been taken to see Zardari at an official resthouse near Islamabad at about 9.30 p.m. on Wednesday , but had been made to wait for more than four hours before her husband was produced . 
&quot; Zardari was in good spirits and so was Bhutto , &quot; said Qureshi , former state minister for parliamentary affairs . 
he said he had not been at the meeting and had no other details . 
the couple &apos;s reunion took place hours after Bhutto had threatened to bring kidnapping charges against Leghari . 
Zardari was picked up by soldiers in Lahore on Tuesday and later transferred to Rawalpindi . 
the caretaker government said on Wednesday that he was in &quot; protective custody , &quot; but did not clarify the grounds on which he was being held . 
Zardari is the target of corruption allegations levelled against Bhutto &apos;s government and has also been accused of conspiring to murder Bhutto &apos;s brother Murtaza , killed by police in Karachi on September 20 . 
Zardari has denied the charges .
