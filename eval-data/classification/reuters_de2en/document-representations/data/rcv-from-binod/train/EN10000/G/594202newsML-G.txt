twenty consecrated virgins from around Britain gathered at Plymouth Cathedral on Monday to renew their lifelong vows of chastity . 
the mass marked the 25th anniversary of the revival of committed lay virgins -- the forerunners to nuns in the Roman Catholic Church . 
the tradition , which ended in Britain in the third century , was phased out entirely by the Church during the 10th century . 
the Vatican revived the holy rite in 1970 and two years later Elizabeth Bailey , 64 , became the first officially consecrated virgin in almost 900 years . 
speaking to &quot; Her sisters in the life of consecrated virginity &quot; Bailey said : &quot; We have all embarked on a journey of faith . 
none of us knew when we took that step what problems we would meet . 
she emphasised the importance of their role and urged those considering taking the vow to consider the benefits of consecration . 
nearly 100 British women , ranging from age 21 to 65 , have followed Bailey &apos;s vow , renouncing sex and pledging themselves as servants of God . 
more than 25 countries have since reinstituted the ancient rite . 
the virgins have no official network or organisation within the Church . 
Monday &apos;s gathering represented the first time they have come together to share their experiences . 
Plymouth &apos;s Bishop Christopher Budd , who has six consecrated virgins in his diocese , said : &quot; It is always going to be a minority vocation . 
in taking the chastity pledge , women are betrothed to Jesus and promise to devote their lives to prayer and good works . 
but they do not enter a Convent and remain a part of secular society . 
Debbie Reynolds , who took the vow last month at the age of 50 , said she did not think she had missed out on anything . 
she said she did have boy friends when she was younger but the relationships were platonic . 
among those attending the service were several much younger women . 
asked if she was considering the vow , 24-year-old Judy Toms said : &quot; definitely not . 
it &apos;s a bit too late for that .
