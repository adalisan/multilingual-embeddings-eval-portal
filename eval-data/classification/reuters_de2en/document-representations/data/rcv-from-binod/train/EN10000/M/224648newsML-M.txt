European bourses ended trade well up on Friday with Frankfurt propelled to a record close by a strong dollar rally which boosted prospects for German exporters . 
Paris stocks finished at their highest level of the year as investors hoped for a speedy end to the French truckers &apos; strike and drew comfort from the dollar &apos;s gains and higher bond prices . 
on currency markets the dollar climbed half a pfennig as traders fretted about growing tension between France and Germany over exchange rates and monetary policy . 
in Frankfurt , floor-trade ended a record-breaking week by closing at an all-time high of 2845.52 points on the DAX index , up 28.03 points , and making a gain of three percent in the week . 
in post-bourse electronic dealing , stocks also surged to a closing record of 2848.84 points on the IBIS DAX index , boosted by the stronger dollar and early gains on Wall Street . 
&quot; The dynamism of the current climb had been surprising , &quot; said Peter Pietsch , economist at Germany &apos;s Commerzbank . 
the market was driven by a dream combination of strength in German government bonds , which have reached all-time highs , and the stronger dollar , benefiting German exporting sectors , in particular the chemical industry . 
in Paris , stocks roared ahead one one stage by 1.4 percent to 2327.81 on the blue-chip CAC-40 , eclipsing the previous intra-day high for 1996 of 2,295.54 and edging closer to its record of 2360.98 set in February 1994 . 
&quot; The bourse is feeling very bullish , &quot; a trader said , amid signs of optimism over the 12-day-old truckers &apos; dispute . 
he spoke as roadblocks were melting away all over France after truck drivers &apos; unions ended talks with employers reporting substantial progress on pay and working hours . 
the sparkling performances in Frankfurt and Paris was largely due to the strengthening dollar . 
it was lifted again by Bank of France monetary policy council member Jean-Pierre Gerard when he said on Thursday he favoured a stronger dollar against the mark . 
one way to drive the dollar higher would be to tempt dollar investors by cutting short-term rates in France and Germany , making equities more attractive . 
in London , suffering from stronger sterling which clouded export prospects , shares put on the weakest showing . 
but the surging continental bourses lent some encouragement to investors and stocks ended up a few points . 
the dollar meanwhile strengthened against the major European currencies as speculation grew about growing pressure on the leading industrialised nations to allow a general revaluation of the dollar in Europe . 
a stream of comments from influential French politicians and central bankers this month all centred around demands for a significantly higher dollar against the franc and other European currencies . 
the French and Swiss francs led the way lower against the dollar to six-month and 21-month lows respectively . 
the dollar currency was at 1.5381 marks in late trading , compared to 1.5320 on Thursday . 
&quot; What we are seeing is a questioning of the central plank of French macroeconomic policy of the last 10 years . 
it &apos;s a very fundamental issue , &quot; said Paul Meggyesi , senior currency analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
the pound soared to a 33-month peak against the mark as a rise in British interest rate looked increasingly likely to staunch inflationary pressures . 
it was at 2.5821 marks and $ 1.6845 at one point . 
the lira also strengthened past a resistance level of 985 lire per mark in late European trade and ventured into territory not seen since the start of July 1994 . 
the dollar was quoted at 113.90 yen and 1.5381 marks against 113.61 yen and 1.5320 marks in late Europe on Thursday . 
the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended 7.8 points higher at 4,058.0 . 
in Paris , the CAC-40 share index finished up 25.35 at 2,315.66 . 
gold was closed at $ 371.35 an ounce , compared with $ 372.70 at the London close on Thursday . 
silver was at $ 4.73 , down one cent .
