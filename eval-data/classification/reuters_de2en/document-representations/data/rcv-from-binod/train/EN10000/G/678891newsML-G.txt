Cantonese , the Chinese dialect spoken in Hong Kong , has a vast demeaning vocabulary for foreigners . 
but people don &apos;t mean it , according to the government . 
&quot; Racial discrimination is not a significant problem in Hong Kong ... colloquial expressions referring to certain races are not due to racial discrimination but merely reflect cultural differences or factors unrelated to race , &quot; said an official . 
Chinese prejudices are many and varied . 
many Hong Kong citizens , who are much richer than their mainland counterparts , have until now -- less than 10 days before China regains control of the territory -- been less than humble towards their mainland counterparts . 
a &quot; Dai Lok Lo &quot; , or &quot; mainland man &quot; , is often quietly despised for his primness . 
the women from north China who have flooded Hong Kong &apos;s night clubs are jeeringly referred to as &quot; Buk goo gai &quot; , which is the name of a popular chicken and mushroom dish but which can also mean &quot; northern prostitute &quot; . 
&quot; Most Hong Kong people look down on mainlanders , they make us feel cheap , &quot; said Guo Zhihui , who has worked in the territory for almost two years as a translator . 
yet , of 238 submissions to a recent consultation by the government &apos;s Home Affairs Branch , 197 said legislation against racism was unnecessary or undesirable . 
only 19 , or eight per cent , expressed the need to outlaw discrimination . 
&quot; I can &apos;t wait to go back to the Philippines , where people treat me as an equal , &quot; said a Filipina who has worked as a house maid in the city for a year . 
she and thousands of others , many of them university graduates , are commonly dubbed &quot; Bun Mui &quot; , the equivalent of &quot; flip girls &quot; . 
some say that discrimination only occurs in isolated cases . 
&quot; In general , we are quite happy about the way our nationals are treated , &quot; Counsul General of the Philippines Estrella Berenguel said . 
other derogatory phrases frequently pop up on television shows and films , although the time-honoured term for Europeans -- &quot; Gweilo &quot; or white ghost -- has lost its original malice . 
it follows that blacks are &quot; black ghosts &quot; . 
&quot; But when compared to other countries I &apos;ve been to , racism is virtually not a problem in Hong Kong , &quot; Botswana &apos;s Consul General Motlhware James Masisi said . 
young Chinese who are educated in the west are not spared either . 
they &apos;re called &quot; bananas &quot; , yellow on the outside but white at heart . 
Japanese are often called &quot; GA Tzai &quot; , mocking their way of speaking , while Indians are &quot; Molocha &quot; , meaning devils .
