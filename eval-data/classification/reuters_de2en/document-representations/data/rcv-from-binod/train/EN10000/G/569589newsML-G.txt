California Democratic leaders on Thursday unveiled a welfare reform plan offering community service jobs to the poor and benefits more generous than those proposed by the Republican governor . 
by the Democrats &apos; own estimates , however , the proposal would cost $ 849 million more to implement in fiscal 1997-98 than Gov. 
Pete Wilson &apos;s welfare reform plan . 
&quot; This is a pragmatic approach to an enormous challenge , &quot; state Senate President Pro TEM Bill Lockyer , a Democrat , said of his party &apos;s &quot; welfare-to-work &quot; program . 
democratic Assembly Speaker Cruz Bustamante added : &quot; Our plan means diversion away from welfare , transition into jobs and protection for children , the elderly and disabled . 
Democrats said their welfare program would provide counties with significant cost savings and commit $ 50 million to job creation programs . 
Wilson said elements of the Democratic plan were &quot; disturbing . 
&quot; The plan will allow people to receive benefits for much longer than the governor had proposed . 
Wilson said Democrats have yet to explain how they would pay for their plan .
