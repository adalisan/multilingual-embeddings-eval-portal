Japanese premiums for aluminium , driven up by low domestic stocks , are likely to ease in the next quarter as a sales tax increase bites into economic growth , traders said on Friday . 
&quot; The premiums for the third quarter should be about $ 10 lower than now . 
I would not buy if it &apos;s $ 80 , &quot; said a trader at a major trading house . 
trading houses and end-users are now getting nervous ahead of next month &apos;s negotiations of premiums for deliveries in the third quarter on long-term contracts . 
of Japan &apos;s annual aluminium demand of some 2.4 million tonnes , about one-third is sold under long-term contracts , another third in development-related long-term deals , and the remaining third through spot deals . 
against the backdrop of a fall in domestic stocks , spot premiums climbed over the past weeks , with traders citing some deals with a premium of as high as $ 90 per tonne , well above about $ 80 in long-term contracts for second quarter deliveries . 
traders said aluminium stocks in Yokohama dropped 36,000 tonnes to 177,700 tonnes at the end of March from the previous month , far below usual levels of well above 200,000 tonnes . 
stocks in Nagoya also fell 15,000 tonnes to about 700,000 . 
in addition to high U.S. premiums , which have attracted flows of metals , domestic aluminium demand has been very strong during the first months of this year ahead of a hike in Japan &apos;s sales tax to five percent from three percent on April 1 . 
&quot; currently , it &apos;s difficult to buy even Russian metals , &quot; said a trader at a trading house , adding that usually Russian aluminium is traded with a discount against western metals . 
however , traders agreed the strong aluminium demand was unlikely to continue throughout the year , with even bullish traders forecasting an annual growth of a mere few percent . 
they expected long term contracts premiums for deliveries in the third quarter were likely to stand below $ 80 . 
&quot; There must be some reaction to the strong growth at the beginning this year . 
many believe it should turn around in the third quarter . 
the construction and the car sectors should suffer a decline following strong growth since late last year , with some signs already evident in slowing housing orders , traders said . 
they are now watching the weather over the next few weeks to determine the direction of demand for beverage cans and air conditioners for the summer . 
&quot; The market should ease after the beginning of May , &quot; said a third trader . 
&quot; The first quarter growth seems to have been 5-6 percent . 
but it will slow down . 
there &apos;s no need to panic . 
the industry should not expect help from higher public spending this year and capital investment in some sectors , such as personnel handyphone systems , should stabilise , he added . 
another trader said : &quot; In the second half of this year , we will also see an increase in supply . 
we heard new production at Australia &apos;s Boyne island is to start in June .
