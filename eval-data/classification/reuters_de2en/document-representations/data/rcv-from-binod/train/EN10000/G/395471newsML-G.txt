Singapore &apos;s elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew called Deng Xiaoping the man who saved China and the island &apos;s leading newspaper said on Friday Deng &apos;s death may mark the last time China is ruled by a strongman . 
&quot; In his time , a strong grip on power stood as the difference between anarchy and a fighting chance for social progress , &quot; The Straits Times newspaper said in an editorial . 
&quot; His death on Wednesday , at age 92 , also brings down the curtain on possibly the last episode of strongman rule in China , &quot; it said . 
&quot; Rule by fiat had been a mixed blessing , and conditions in a modernising China almost certainly will make a replication impossible , &quot; it added . 
Lee said Deng saved China from the kind of disintegration that finished off the Soviet Union . 
&quot; He saved China . 
without him , China could have been like the Soviet Union . 
instead China will become a huge heavyweight nation in 30 years , &quot; Lee said in a statement . 
the Straits Times said Deng was &quot; one of the great men of the 20th century &quot; and could one day be judged &quot; China &apos;s most inspired leader &quot; despite his 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Tiananmen Square . 
&quot; The results of his economic reforms will be beneficial , not just for China , but the entire global community too and will be felt well into the 21st century in every country where goods will be made and sold , &quot; the editorial said . 
it said the Tiananmen Square crackdown could be justified by reasons of national security , but was a &quot; blot on his record &quot; and added that Deng &apos;s failure to relax controls was a mistake . 
&quot; The one regret about Deng is that his judgment , perhaps coloured by an atavistic fear of chaos , did not allow him to relax political and social control even as the southern regions became capitalistic in all but name , &quot; the newspaper said . 
&quot; That had allowed corruption and crime to thrive and local satraps to ride roughshod over small-town folk . 
people &apos;s basic rights , especially in the farming interior , are being short-changed , &quot; it added . 
&quot; Deng &apos;s successors should be alive to the danger . 
earlier , Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said the legacy of the paramount leader would be a &quot; strong and prosperous China &quot; . 
Goh , who met Deng several times , described him as one of the world &apos;s great leaders who &quot; saw events in historical sweep , and thought in terms of generations &quot; .
