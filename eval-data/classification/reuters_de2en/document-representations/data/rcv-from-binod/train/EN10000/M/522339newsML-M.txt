Taiwan share prices were expected to open higher on Friday with investors hunting for bargains after Thursday &apos;s sharp losses , but the rebound would not be significant , brokers said . 
market focus would fall on shipping shares following China &apos;s approval on Thursday for six Taiwan shippers to commence direct sails across the Taiwan Strait , brokers said . 
&quot; buying interest should be boosted by bargain-hunting and by the shipping news , but it will not be enough to change the cautious sentiment , &quot; said David Yu , vice president of International Investment Trust .
