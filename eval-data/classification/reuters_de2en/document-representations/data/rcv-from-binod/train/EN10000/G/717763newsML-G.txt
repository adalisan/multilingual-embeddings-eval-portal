the Queensland Government has again narrowly retained office , after winning a confidence motion put forward by the Premier . 
it &apos;s the third time the Government has survived a confidence motion since taking office last year . 
premier Rob Borbidge says he had no choice , after a censure motion against him and Treasurer Joan Sheldon was passed with the support of Gladstone Independent Liz Cunningham who holds the balance of power in the Parliament . 
the censure motion claimed the Premier and the Treasurer had misled the house and the people of Queensland over the implications of the Suncorp-Metway merger . 
opposition Leader Peter Beattie claims the Coalition Government is on a downward spiral , and says he does not believe it can survive until Christmas . 
the Army &apos;s Blackhawk squadron and Special Air Service troops have begun this year &apos;s joint counter terrorism exercises in North Queensland . 
during the exercises last year , 18 men died when two blackhawks collided in mid-air during a night time counter terrorism exercise , near Townsville . 
Minister for Defence , Ian Mclachlan , says he is confident this year &apos;s exercise will be a success . 
Mr McLachlan has also confirmed that the money will be made available to implement the recommendations from the board of inquiry into last year &apos;s tragedy . 
he says the defence department has an obligation to remedy the 72 faults that were found to exist in the circumstances of the Blackhawks . 
the Minister says it is one of the most important things his department has to do . 
the Law Council of Australia has appealed to the Prime Minister to delay any further consideration of changes to tribunals which hear appeals against Government decisions . 
the organisation , which represents the legal profession , is concerned Cabinet will change the way review tribunals operate , removing their independence from the Federal bureaucracy . 
dozens of Commonwealth tribunals are used to hear appeals against decisions ranging from social security entitlements to taxation matters . 
law Council President , Peter Short , says a letter has been sent to the Prime Minister asking him to release the proposed changes for public examination . 
Mr Short says there is concern the revamping of the tribunals is being dealt with secretly , and with unwarranted urgency . 
the New South Wales Labor Council will put its case today for an 8.75 per cent adjustment to basic award levels in the state industrial system . 
the claim before the New South Wales Industrial Commission follows one put by the ACTU at a federal level , and is expected to result in an outcome close to the ten dollars granted there . 
Labor Council Secretary Peter Sams says he &apos;s confident of achieving a good result , but would have appreciated stronger support from the state government . 
foreign Affairs Minister , Alexander downer , says Australians in Cambodia , who don &apos;t have any essential reason to be there , should get out as soon as they can . 
but Mr downer says the Australian Government doesn &apos;t believe the current situation , warrants the launch of an evacuation plan , as things in Cambodia are a little better . 
meanwhile , the United States &apos; State Department says no decision has been made to evacuate US nationals from the region , but says there are contingency plans . 
the U-S has accused Cambodia &apos;s second Prime Minister , Hun Sen , of attempting to rupture the peace accords and blamed him for starting the current fighting . 
State Department spokesman , Nicholas Burns , has condemned the use of force and says the Co-Premier is attempting to overturn the wishes of the Cambodian people following the election . 
the US is also troubled by the second prime Minister , Norodom Ranariddh &apos;s apparent efforts to ally his forces with what is left of the Khmer Rouge . 
Prince Ranariddh will visit the US later this week for urgent talks with the Clinton administration and UN Secretary General , Kotti Annan . 
while the official policy on the sale of tickets to Olympic events in Sydney is not expected to be made until next year , a major union is calling for nationwide lotteries for ticket distribution . 
the liquor , hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union says the plan would make Olympic tickets available to people who could not normally afford to go to high profile and expensive events . 
the Union says the lotteries could be targeted to different events and priced according to their popularity . 
it says if the concept is adopted , people could see a swimming final for $ 10 or an opening or closing ceremony for $ 20 . 
the union says plan , which is known to the the Olympics Minister Office , would not reduce the ticket sales revenue if tens of thousands of people bought into the lottery . 
a vote is due to be taken today in the South Australian Legislative Council on legislation to allow chemists to sell marijuana . 
the Australian Democrats &apos; bill seeks to wipe out the black market in the drug and associated organised crime . 
Democrat MP , Mike Elliott , says if the drug was sold by chemists they would have to warn buyers about its health risks . 
under his plan there would no promotion of the drug , which he says would be grown by licensed primary producers . 
the bill will be the subject of a conscience vote and , if passed , will go to the Lower House for consideration . 
the Group which was sponsoring the Australian tour by former black panther , Lorenzo Ervin , says deporting the controversial activist is an act of white supremacism . 
Mr Ervin was arrested in Brisbane yesterday after Acting Immigration Minister , Amanda Vanstone , cancelled his visa on the grounds he was not of good character and his visit was not in the national interest . 
Phil Dickinson from the &quot; angry People &quot; anarchist group has slammed the decision saying the Government has no concept of free speech , and fears resistance from Australia &apos;s indigenous people . 
Mr Ervin says visiting Queensland has reminded him of the racial hatred of America &apos;s deep south . 
he says Australia &apos;s civil rights are under threat because of Pauline Hanson and the Prime Minister &apos;s support for his deportation . 
Pauline Hanson &apos;s One Nation Party was launched in Canberra last night accompanied by a rowdy protest from about 1,500 people . 
police made two arrests as protesters jeered One Nation supporters at the National Press Club . 
about 150 Pauline Hanson supporters braved the protesters to attend the meeting , which went smoothly until the ejection of a woman who questioned the party &apos;s attitude to Aborigines and multiculturalism . 
meeting convenor Shaun Nelson told the gathering that Miss Hanson would go out into the community over the next 12 months to consult on policy formulation . 
later , Mr Nelson said he was happy with the attendance but said some supporters had been deterred by the protests . 
as the meeting wound up , police arrested two protesters , one was charged with assaulting police and resisting arrest , the other was taken into custody for breaching the peace .
