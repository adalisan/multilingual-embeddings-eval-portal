U.S. debt futures ended steady to lower , with the long end under profit-taking pressure heading into the weekend , traders said . 
trading was choppy and indecisive much of the day , wandering between a nine-month high and support at 114-25 / 32 . 
traders said some players may have decided to take profts heading into the weekend amid the idea the market &apos;s rally this week may have been overdone . 
&quot; We &apos;ve had a good strong run ( but ) we &apos;re starting to have less impulse to the upside , &quot; said Eric Herndon , vice president taxable trading for Griffin , Kubik , Stephens and Thompson . 
traders said technical factors took center stage and many technicians cast wary eyes to resistance above 115-00 . 
&quot; Over the course of the last two days that market has done real well and we got up to these resistance levels with no dramatic fundamental news , so people are now taking profits , &quot; said Kurt Fraim , futures analyst with Aubrey G. Lanston . 
he pegged resistance from 115-00 to 115-16 / 32 . 
&quot; You get to these levels and people start thinking it might be time for a pullback , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Or on the other hand , they wonder if we &apos;re going to go through it and force people to buy it , &quot; he said . 
other technicians pegged a barrier above the market from 115-15 / 32 to 115-24 / 32 . 
in light of that resistance and this week &apos;s mixed bag of economic data , bullish momentum waned , traders said . 
&quot; fundamentally , we need to hear continuously that the economy is slowing further than we think it is now and some of the things we &apos;ve gotten don &apos;t back up that view , &quot; Griffin &apos;s Herndon said . 
&quot; I think we pushed it a little too far , too fast , &quot; Herndon said of the rally to nine-month highs . 
&quot; Yes , the economy is a little slower , but not that slow , &quot; he said . 
December T-bond options and T-note options expired at midday with little fanfare . 
DEC T-bonds settled down 11 / 32 to 114-30 / 32 , muni-bonds fell 12 / 32 to 117-1 / 32 , March Euros were flat at 94.49 and Dec 10-year notes lost 5 / 32 to 110-22 / 32 .
