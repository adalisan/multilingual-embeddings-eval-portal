IPE gas oil and Brent futures were both expected to open unchanged on Thursday , reflecting little movement in the U.S. and Singapore markets overnight . 
July gas oil was seen unmoved from its prior close of $ 158.75 a tonne while August Brent was not expected to budge from its closing price of $ 17.77 a barrel . 
though static prices were anticipated , brokers said the market was balanced in a range as competing factors cancelled each other out . 
&quot; The fundamentals are negative but there is a little bit of a lift coming from worries over the Iraq situation , &quot; one broker said . 
an Iraqi diplomat at the U.N. said on Wednesday Baghdad would not resume crude sales under its oil-for-food deal with the U.N. until money raised from its exports under the first six months of the agreement had all been spent . 
brokers were unsure which way the market would move next . 
&quot; fundamentally the market is weak and if it can &apos;t hold support it will break lower , &quot; one said .
