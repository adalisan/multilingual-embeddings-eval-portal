Michael Doohan stormed to his fourth successive world championship on Sunday by winning the 500cc British motorcycling Grand Prix . 
the win meant the 32-year-old Australian rode his Honda straight into the history books as only the third rider to win four consecutive titles , after Mike Hailwood and Giacomo Agostini . 
a top seven finish in Donington would have been enough for the Australian to retain the 1997 title but Doohan , who had won nine of the 10 races prior to the British event , was in no mood to take things easy . 
he made a poor start from pole and went into the first corner in fifth place . 
by the third lap he was in the lead and looked set to cruise to victory . 
but team mate Tadayuki Okada pressed him hard and slipped past him on lap 21 . 
Doohan eventually retook the lead on lap 25 and grimly held on until the end of the 30-lap race . 
he took the chequered flag a few metres ahead of Okada , his left fist punching the air . 
Brazil &apos;s Alex Barros was in third on his Honda , having won another close fight with Italian Luca Cadalora who eventually finished fifth behind Nobuatsu Aoki of Japan . 
Doohan has four races left to smash Agostini &apos;s record 11 wins in one season , a statistic that has stood for a quarter of a century . 
he now has 270 points , with Okada on 149 and Aoki on 139 .
