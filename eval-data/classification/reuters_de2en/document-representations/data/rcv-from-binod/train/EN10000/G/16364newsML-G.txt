Yugoslav army officers are visiting Croatia to count Croatian army artillery pieces under an arms-control agreement signed in Florence last June , state media said on Tuesday . 
they said a five-member team of Serbian officers met a Croatian army delegation at the border on Monday and immediately went to the first of seven planned inspection sites , a barracks in the northwest town of Varazdin . 
Croatian militaries in turn are due to pay six visits to artillery sites in Serbia , the dominant remaining Yugoslav republic , to check &quot; registered and unregistered &quot; locations , the government-run newspaper Vjesnik said . 
bilateral arms control went ahead after Croatia and Yugoslavia signed a mutual recognition treaty in Belgrade last Friday , normalising relations after five years of conflict .
