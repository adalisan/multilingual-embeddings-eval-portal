artists Christo and his wife Jeanne-Claude , who wrapped Germany &apos;s past and future parliament building the Reichstag in glitzy silver fabric last year , unveiled their latest art projects on Monday . 
at a presentation in Hamburg , the couple said they planned to cover the Arkansas River in the United States and erect tall gates in New York &apos;s Central Park . 
they had no dates set for when the projects would go ahead . 
&quot; Our projects are like babies . 
we plan them for their own sake , &quot; said Jeanne Claude , explaining that she and her Bulgarian-born husband did not set out to make a profit from their bizarre artistic projects . 
&quot; Over the River &quot; would involve covering the Arkansas River in the state of Colorado with up to 10 km of bands of fabric placed across it , the New York-based artists told journalists . 
there would be no damage to the environment because the nylon covering would be suspended a metre above the water and would make room for rocks , trees or bridges , they said . 
&quot; The Gates &quot; would involve putting up several five-metre ( 15-foot ) tall steel gates along Central Park &apos;s footpaths . 
the couple said they never funded their projects with public money and would raise the money needed themselves . 
the artists have earned notoriety over the years with bizarre projects like lining a stretch of Australian coastline in fabric , surrounding Florida islands in pink plastic and opening 3,000 blue and yellow umbrellas in Japan and California simultaneously . 
wrapping Berlin &apos;s historic Reichstag building last year took a week and fulfilled a long-standing dream for the couple . 
the scheme had provoked strong opposition from Chancellor Helmut Kohl and conservatives , who felt it was disrespectful to a building which was inaugurated in 1894 as united Germany &apos;s parliament , gutted by fire in 1933 and heavily bombed in 1945 . 
the project was only narrowly approved in 1994 after a 70-minute debate in parliament .
