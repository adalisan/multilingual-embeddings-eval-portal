diminished concerns about winterkill in the U.S. winter wheat growing region plus ideas the market had been overbought , pressured CBOT wheat futures to a lower close , traders said . 
&quot; There was the cold weather talk but it was overblown , &quot; said Steve Bruce of E.D. 
and F. Man International . 
meteorologists said a dusting of snow overnight in portions of the U.S. Plains eased concerns of winterkill . 
light snow was falling in western Kansas Tuesday morning and heavier snows were forecast for later in the day , said Joel Burgio , meteorologist for weather Services Corp. 
wheat futures surged Friday on bullish input from a USDA forecast for 1997 U.S. winter wheat acreage at a level well below expectations . 
the rally Friday and gains Monday left the market vulnerable for a technical setback , the traders said . 
news that Algeria bought 75,000 tonnes of wheat from France rather than the U.S. also may have weighed on prices . 
Pakistan Monday bought 180,000 tonnes of wheat from Australia and 135,000 from the U.S. , giving the market little direction , the traders said . 
wheat closed three cents per bushel lower to 1 / 2 higher , with March down three at $ 3.88 a bushel . 
early Tuesday , technicians said the four and 20-day moving averages ( Ma ) showed a bear flag for the March but the Ma in the May and July contracts were showing bullish signals . 
the daily nine-day relative strength index ( RSI ) for the March remained near neutral territory through the session Tuesday at near 48 points , below the 53 point level seen at Monday &apos;s close . 
chart watchers generally consider an RSI of 30 or less as indicative of a potential oversold market and 70 or more as a sign the market is becoming overbought . 
first support in the March was at $ 3.86 per bushel and the session low was at $ 3.87 . 
second support was at $ 3.78-1 / 2 . 
&quot; There was talk of sell-stops resting at 87 or below but I don &apos;t know if they &apos;ll remain there tomorrow , &quot; a trader said . 
first resistance was at $ 3.93-1 / 2 and second resistance was at $ 4.01 . 
wheat futures volume was estimated at 15,000 contracts , below the 17,363 contracts traded Monday , according to the CBOT . 
in wheat options , FIMAT futures sold 1,000 May $ 2.70 puts at 8-1 / 4 to 8-1 / 2 cents , E.D. 
and F. Man International sold 200 July $ 3.70 calls at 15-1 / 4 cents and Tenco Inc bought 200 March $ 4.00 calls at six cents , traders said . 
wheat options volume was estimated at 5,000 contracts , below the 10,590 traded Monday .
