the Lithuanian economy , which recorded the highest growth and lowest inflation of any of the Baltic states in 1996 , will grow further in the next two years , central bank deputy head Jonas Niaura said on Saturday . 
&quot; GDP is expected to grow about five prcent this year as the private sector is expanding and enterprise restructuring is progressing , &quot; Niaura told a Euromoney conference , adding the economy would grow by seven to eight percent in 1998 . 
consumer price inflation , which at 13.1 percent in 1996 was the lowest in the Baltic region , would ease to 12 percent this year and to less than 10 percent next year . 
Niaura also said the central bank &apos;s gross reserves stood at $ 814 million at the end of March . 
its official reserves were $ 795 million in February . 
he said the priority for this year was creating the conditions for rapid and sustainable growth . 
&quot; An important aspect of our strategy is the gradual convergence of Lithuania &apos;s macroeconomic indicators with the level of the rest of Europe , with the eventual aim of achieving full membership of the European Union , &quot; Niaura said . 
economic policy priorities for this year included improving monetary and exchange rate policy and the banking sector , cutting the budget deficit and making headway with privatisation for cash . 
the right-of-centre government has said it will gradually phase out its currency board system , under which the central bank guarantees it will keep one dollar in reserve for every four litas in circulation , freezing the exchange rate at that level .
