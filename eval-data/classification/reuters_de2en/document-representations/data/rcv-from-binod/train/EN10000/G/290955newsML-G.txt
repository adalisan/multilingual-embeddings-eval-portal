the PLO said on Tuesday an Israeli demand to delay by two years a promised troop pullback from West Bank areas was a key obstacle to a deal on handing over most of Hebron town to Palestinian self-rule . 
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross continued his mediation efforts between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat . 
Ross and Arafat held five hours of talks on Tuesday night in the Gaza Strip . 
Ross told reporters afterwards the sides had not yet reached agreement . 
&quot; I think we had a long meeting in which we tried to work through the remaining issues . 
we made an effort to overcome the remaining differences . 
we &apos;re not there yet . 
I hope we will get there but we are not there yet , &quot; Ross said . 
earlier on Tuesday Netanyahu said the sides had agreed on most points and it would soon be evident if an accord had been reached . 
he did not elaborate . 
&quot; We are in fact in the final stages of negotiations but I cannot tell you when we will conclude an agreement because we have been in the final stages of negotiations for the last six to eight weeks and the decision not to close the agreement has essentially been a Palestinian decision , &quot; Netanyahu told Jewish leaders from abroad . 
David Bar-Illan , Netanyahu &apos;s communications director , said the sides were wrangling over peace moves to follow Hebron . 
Bar-Illan confirmed Israel wanted to postpone to 1999 the last of three Israeli redeployments from occupied rural West Bank areas which under a 1995 interim peace deal were to be completed by September 1997 . 
&quot; The last redeployment is a very , very contentious issue . 
our interpretations are very far apart , &quot; he told Reuters . 
Bar-Illan said Netanyahu proposed to Ross in a pre-dawn meeting that Israel complete further West Bank pullouts by the spring of 1999 , when the sides are slated to complete &quot; final status &quot; peace negotiations . 
PLO officials quickly blasted the Israeli proposal as a violation of timetables set under the original peace deal signed with Israel &apos;s previous Labour-led government . 
&quot; This is an irresponsible proposal ... the agreement specifically states that the last stage of further redeployments from the West Bank be completed by September 7 , 1997 , &quot; negotiator Hassan Asfour told Reuters . 
Ross held talks with Netanyahu in Jerusalem earlier on Tuesday which the prime minister &apos;s office said did not signal any breakthroughs . 
but Netanyahu said later : &quot; We can close this agreement if there is goodwill on the other side . 
we shall see very soon . 
Arafat aide Nabil Abu Rdainah said the PLO was seeking detailed American guarantees Israel would implement interim peace deals to the letter . 
&quot; We will not sign an agreement without American guarantees , &quot; Abu Rdainah told Reuters . 
PLO officials said the United States was willing to supply only vaguely worded guarantees . 
Bar-Illan said Netanyahu and Arafat could meet soon to try again to hammer out a deal . 
the two leaders had met secretly on Saturday night . 
Israel &apos;s handover of most of Hebron has been delayed for 10 months over security concerns and violence . 
the volatile city is home to 400 Jewish settlers and 100,000 Palestinians .
