Spiro T. Agnew , U.S. vice president under President Richard Nixon from 1969 until his resignation in 1973 , died at Atlantic General Hospital on Tuesday , according to the Ullrich Funeral Home . 
Agnew , 77 , was taken to the hospital earlier , but a hospital spokeswoman declined to release any details of his illness . 
the cause of death was not immediately known . 
Agnew left office on October 10 , 1973 rather than stand trial on charges he had extorted money while serving as governor of Maryland in 1967 and 1968 , making him the first vice president to resign under threat of prosecution . 
Agnew , a political brawler who dismissed his foes as &quot; nattering nabobs of negativism , &quot; pleaded &quot; no contest &quot; to one charge of income tax evasion in exchange for a Justice Department agreement not to prosecute him on charges he demanded payoffs from firms bidding on contracts awarded by the state of Maryland . 
justice said the payments continued during his four and a half years as vice president . 
Agnew was sentenced to three years probation and fined $ 10,000 . 
hospital spokeswoman Dayna Mitchell could confirm only that Agnew was a patient , but gave no additional details . 
the Ullrich Funeral Home in Berlin , near the Maryland coastal resort of Ocean City , also had no further information on the cause of Agnew &apos;s death .
