the dollar hugged 1.49 marks and 109 yen throughout the European session as a string of U.S. economic data later in the week kept a lid on activity . 
immediate supports just below both thresholds failed to give way despite sporadic downside tests by interbank operators , while gains looked difficult so long as 1.4960 marks and 109.30 yen remained elusive , dealers and analysts said . 
although U.S. rate rise speculation remains high , traders were unwilling to take positionss until at least after the Beige Book is published on Wednesday , they said . 
strong U.S. jobs data last Friday have heightened expectations of a U.S. rate rise after the next Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meeting on September 24 . 
the dollar &apos;s failure to gather momentum , despite underlying concerns over the Gulf and Russian President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s health , is keeping most players away , dealers said . 
&quot; People are looking for a 25 basis point ( U.S. rate ) rise but if the inflation figures are low , it still could tip the balance , &quot; said Pat Magill , head of the corporate desk at Daiwa Bank here . 
the perceived target for the federal funds rate is at 5.25 percent . 
&quot; Without a further upward shift in rate expectations this week , which is unlikely , the dollar could weaken , &quot; said Don Smith , an economist at HSBC Midland in London . 
the key level to break is 1.4960 marks , the top of the current range and a high set on August 22 . 
it also represents a 38.2 Fibonacci retracement of the decline from 1.5488 to 1.4635 between May and July this year , according to chartists . 
dollar / yen was burdened by offers lined up above 109.30 yen , and mark / yen &apos;s fall towards 73 weighed on sentiment . 
it stood at 109.05 / 15 at 1503 GMT , slightly below Friday &apos;s 109.31 / 41 close in Europe . 
U.S. wage inflation clues will emerge in the Beige Book . 
other signals on price pressures will become clearer after Thursday &apos;s producer prices and consumer prices on Friday . 
retail sales figures are also due on Friday . 
data due later today include U.S. July consumer credit , which is seen dipping to $ 7.2 billion from $ 8.3 billion in June . 
the lira was buoyed to two-month highs versus the mark in the afternoon and stood at 1010.90 / 25 at 1511 GMT versus 1013.65 / 14 late on Friday . 
the lira &apos;s near term prospects rest primarily on whether the dollar can cling to its bid tone against the mark , dealers said . 
a dealer at a UK bank said there has been foreign demand for Italian bonds , which may be spilling over to help the lira against the mark . 
she expected mark / lira to revisit the 1,000 key barrier as Italy &apos;s plans to put the lira back into the ERM simmer .
