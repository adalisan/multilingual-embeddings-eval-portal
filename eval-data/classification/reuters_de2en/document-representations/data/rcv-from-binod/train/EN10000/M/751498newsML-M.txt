Belgian bonds are heading for a re-test of February &apos;s all-time highs following U.S. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s reassuring remarks on inflation , dealers and analysts said on Wednesday . 
OLOs surged in early trade on the back of the comments , with end-investors scrambling to buy paper of 10-years and up , dealers said . 
any late summer gains could , however , be capped by the prospect of higher European growth , they added . 
talk of a weak Euro , which has pushed the dollar higher against the mark , was not yet a factor for hard core European bonds . 
the benchmark 10-year OLO yielded 5.56 percent by around 0930 GMT on Wednesday , down from 5.61 percent late on Tuesday and levels of around 5.69 percent a week ago . 
the front-month OLO future was up 0.35 at 122.66 after setting a contract high of 122.72 , albeit in very thin trade . 
the moves took the market near the record levels set on February 18 , when the 10-year OLO yield hit 5.50 percent and the OLO future ( then a different contract ) touched 123.83 . 
&quot; Maybe 5.50 percent is now possible , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; End-investors are looking for the long-term paper .
