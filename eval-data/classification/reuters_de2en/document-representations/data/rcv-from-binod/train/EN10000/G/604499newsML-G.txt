reigning world rally champion Tommi Makinen made the best of difficult conditions on the opening day of the Rally of Argentina on Thursday to open up a crucial six second lead after four stages . 
the Finnish Mitsubishi driver , who heads the world drivers &apos; championship after six rounds , took the Argentinan lead on the dusty third stage from Villa Albertina to Ischilin to lead teammate Briton Richard Burns by six seconds after the fourth stage . 
Makinen &apos;s title rivals , Briton Colin McRae and Spaniard Carlos Sainz , were tied in third place , both 12 seconds off the lead , after heading the running in the opening stages . 
McRae , who will take the lead of the championship if he wins the rally , had set the joint fastest time on the first stage of the rally but slowly dropped away over the following three stages with his Subaru not as suited to the gravel conditions as Makinen &apos;s Mitsubishi . 
Sainz , however , could well have made the early running were it not for two incidents on the second and third stages . 
he was leading at the end of the second stage , despite landing heavily off a jump , but then damaged his Ford going through water on the third stage which cost him vital time . 
the opening stage of the rally had been delayed for 45 minutes because of spectators pouring on to the route and the following stages were left running up to one hour late .
