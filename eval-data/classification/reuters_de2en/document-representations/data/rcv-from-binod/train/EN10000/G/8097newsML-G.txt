the Sheikh of al-Azhar , Egypt &apos;s leading authority on Islamic affairs , said in an interview published on Thursday that an Egyptian court was right to divorce a university professor on grounds of apostasy . 
the only way back for academic Nasr Abu Zeid was to renounce his writings in public , Sheikh Mohamed Sayyed Tantawi told the London-based Arabic newspaper al-Hayat . 
the Court of Cassation upheld earlier this month a ruling annulling Abu Zeid &apos;s marriage , against the wishes of Abu Zeid and his wife , because of his writings on interpretations of the Moslem holy book the Koran . 
the case has become a cause celebre in the ideological battle between Islamic traditionalists and advocates of human rights and intellectual freedom . 
&quot; The judiciary in this case followed the rules of Islamic law , &quot; the sheikh said . 
&quot; The verdict is now binding and the case is closed . 
the judiciary has annulled the marriage and the couple must separate . 
by this ruling , he has been separated from her and she from him and if one dies , the other cannot inherit , &quot; he added . 
asked if Abu Nasr could repent , the sheikh said : &quot; This depends on whether he comes again and declares that he dissociates himself from everything he has written . 
it would not be enough for Abu Zeid merely to repeat the Moslem profession of faith if he also made blasphemous remarks on the Koran , the sheikh added . 
Abu Zeid and his wife , fellow academic Ibtihal Younis , have taken refuge in the Netherlands and human rights group say their lives could be in danger if they came home to Egypt . 
Younis has said that she and her husband will continue to fight against the court &apos;s verdict . 
the professor , like other liberal Moslems , has upset the traditionalists by analysing the political factors behind the development of orthodox Islam . 
he says references in the Koran to some supernatural phenomena should be read as metaphors . 
asked if the ruling would not close the door to new interpretations in Islam , the sheikh said he welcomed innovation where innovation was permissible . 
&quot; But if someone came and said that the sun rises in the west rather than the east , we wouldn &apos;t call this new interpretation . 
there can be innovation only in peripheral matters , not in aspects of religion which are necessarily permanent , &quot; he said .
