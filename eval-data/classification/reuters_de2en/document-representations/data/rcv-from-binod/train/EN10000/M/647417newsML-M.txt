slower Indian demand for gold and uncertainty ahead of the budget in Pakistan are likely to keep regional prices of the metal under pressure this week , dealers said on Monday . 
they said the trend in the Indian sub-continent would affect bullion trade in Dubai , which meets the region &apos;s demand for gold . 
in Bombay , standard gold ( 24 carat ) lost 90 rupees per 10 grams to 4,680 rupees in the week to Monday . 
&quot; While Indian demand is poor , a rise in imports , both official and unofficial , has affected prices , &quot; said Makhan Lal Damani , president of the Bombay Bullion Association . 
India imports about 400 tonnes of the metal each year , a fourth of it through unofficial channels . 
according to dealers , gold is generally smuggled when world prices are low , as in the recent past , when profit margins are sufficient to cover the risks involved . 
&quot; There is a rise in the arrival of gold smuggled by sea every year before the onset of monsoon rains in June , &quot; said a dealer . 
dealers said bullion trade in India was passing through the lean months of June and July after the end of a four-month wedding season in May . 
in Karachi , Pakistan &apos;s main commercial city , gold prices are likely to remain mixed ahead of the fiscal budget for 1997 / 98 ( July-June ) , which is being unveiled on Friday , dealers said . 
prices fluctuated due to speculative buying , a dealer said . 
in the week to Saturday , standard gold fell 65 rupees per 10 grams to 4,685 rupees . 
in Dubai , the market remained subdued as Indian bullion demand maintained its seasonal downturn , traders and wholesalers said . 
they said re-exports of gold were capped by a lack of Indian wedding season demand , which is not expected to resume until the end of India &apos;s June to September monsoon season . 
&quot; Most of my Indian clients have gone on holiday , so business has slowed down . 
I do not expect it to pick up for at least another month , &quot; said one Indian trader based in Dubai .
