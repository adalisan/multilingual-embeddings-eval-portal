Czech industrial sales fell in the first quarter of 1997 in a further sign of economic slowdown while nominal wages rose and most analysts said no rapid improvement was in prospect . 
sales in March fell 0.8 percent year-on-year , after a 3.6 percent fall in February when sales were hit by a five-day rail strike . 
for the first quarter of this year , industrial sales were down 1.5 percent compared with a year earlier , the Czech Statistical Office ( CSU ) said . 
at the same time , nominal industrial wages grew 14.6 percent after an 11.4 percent rise in February . 
for the first three months of the year , wages rose 13.4 percent . 
&quot; For the March data , there is no excuse of a rail strike or harsh winter . 
it may simply mean the start of a tendency , &quot; said economic researcher Jiri Krovak of WoodCommerz . 
&quot; In the last quarter of 1996 , there was a considerable decline and that continued in the first quarter , &quot; he added . 
the Czech Republic has enjoyed several years of consumption-led growth but output is declining and the country is running big trade and current account deficits . 
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus , unveiling a package of measure earlier this month aimed at stabilising the economy and restoring growth , said it would be a success if GDP grew this year by half the 5.4 percent origninal forecast . 
the package included restrictions on wage growth , public spending cuts and administrative measures to curb imports . 
&quot; ( The economy ) certainly will face a considerable slowdown this year . 
if the economy stabilises , we have to pay the cost of stabilisation and that is a decline in growth , &quot; Krovak said . 
but IPB bank chief economist Miroslav Soucek said the slower rate of decline in sales , from 1.7 percent in the first two months of the year , was a positive indicator . 
&quot; The pessimistic outlooks for this quarter are not fulfilled , &quot; he said , adding that wage growth was also below the 18 percent recorded for the whole of 1996 . 
Zivnostenska Banka chief economist Pavel Sobisek said an improvement in industrial sales could be expected no earlier than in May once the effect of a weaker crown , which has depreciated some five percentage points against its mark / dollar basket in the past month , were felt . 
&quot; The depreciation may help exports but there is definitely some delay , &quot; he said . 
Czech National Bank ( CNB ) governor Josef Tosovsky has said wage growth is a key problem for the economy and that it could not afford more than a 10 percent nominal rise in pay in 1997 . 
&quot; Industry is roughly 35 percent of the economy so this will be very difficult to achieve , &quot; said Krovak . 
Klaus , in outlining the jump-start package , criticised central bank monetary policy as being too restrictive . 
but the bank board last week left its interest rates unchanged and bank officials have said no change in rates is imminent . 
CNB board member Ludek Niedermeyer said on Monday that the bank would carefully study the effect of a requirment on importers of certain goods to deposit for 180 days 20 percnet of the value of the imports . 
the deposits will ultimately be frozen in the central bank . 
Sobisek said he did not see any change in monetary policy until at least July 1 when government decisions to further deregulate rents and energy prices take effect .
