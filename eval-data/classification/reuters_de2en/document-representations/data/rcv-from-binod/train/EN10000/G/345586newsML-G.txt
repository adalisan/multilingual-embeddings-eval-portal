the United States on Thursday accused China of effectively silencing in 1996 all public dissent against the communist party and the government . 
in its annual human rights report , the State Department concluded that &quot; no dissidents were known to be active at year &apos;s end . 
&quot; The Chinese government in 1996 continued to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses , in violation of internationally-accepted norms , stemming from the authorities &apos; intolerance of dissent , fear of unrest and the continuing absence of laws protecting basic freedoms , &quot; the report said . 
&quot; All public dissent against party and government was effectively silenced by intimidation , exile or the imposition of prison terms , administrative detention or house arrest , &quot; it said . 
the United States regularly criticises China &apos;s record in its annual assessment of human rights around the world . 
this year &apos;s hard-hitting report comes as Washington and Beijing have been making a major effort to improve their relationship , which had deteriorated seriously . 
this year &apos;s report would seem to make it impossible for the United States not to sponsor a controversial resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva faulting China &apos;s record .
