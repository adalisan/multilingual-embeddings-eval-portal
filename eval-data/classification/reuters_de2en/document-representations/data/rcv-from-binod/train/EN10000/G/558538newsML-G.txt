a politician who once described children of mixed races as &quot; mongrels &quot; said on Sunday his re-election as the mayor of a South Australia state town should act as a message to the Australian government . 
Peter Davis , who was re-elected on Saturday as mayor of Port Lincoln , a coastal town 700 km ( 435 miles ) west of Adelaide , also said he supports the views of race row politician Pauline Hanson on immigration and multiculturalism . 
&quot; People have had enough of not being listened to , &quot; Davis told Reuters . 
&quot; None of our neighbours practises multiculturalism but we do not call our neighbours racist , &quot; he said . 
Terry Krieg , who stood unsuccessfully against Davis , called his opponent &quot; a menace to this society &quot; . 
&quot; There is a large body of people in this town who share his views and that is a very serious and sad situation for an otherwise beautiful place , &quot; Krieg said of the fishing and farming community of about 13,000 people . 
nine of the ten members of Port Lincoln &apos;s council resigned late last year after Davis made his comment about mixed race children .
