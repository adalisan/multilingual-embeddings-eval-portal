Commonwealth Secretary-General Chief Emeka Anyaoku said on Sunday that some African states &quot; have not quite yet got the hang of democracy . 
but he said the continent had made progress , eight countries in the past six years having changed from one-party systems and military regimes . 
Anyaoku , speaking to BBC television , confirmed reports that the Palestinians under Yassar Arafat had indicated a wish to join the informal grouping of Britain and its former colonies . 
but , noting that Palestine would not become a state until 1999 , he added that &quot; I believe discussions at this stage would be very preliminary . 
Anyaoku , returning from a Commonwealth roundtable on democracy in Botswana , said &quot; I believe that African countries have made a very good start . 
&quot; Six years ago , there were nine countries that were either under a military regime or a one-party state . 
now it is only one left . 
that is Anyaoku &apos;s homeland of Nigeria , under sharp attack in the Commonwealth for human rights abuses . 
reporting on the views of African leaders at the Botswana meeting , he said &quot; People generally felt Nigeria was not moving as fast as it could . 
the Commonwealth chief said he was optimistic about Africa &apos;s democratisation efforts but added &quot; There are a few countries that have not yet quite got the hang of democracy . 
&quot; accommodation with the opposition parties is very crucial . 
parties must be able to work together and avoid the question of winner-takes-all politics . 
that is a key factor .
