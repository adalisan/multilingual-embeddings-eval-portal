the world &apos;s first voluntary euthanasia law faced a new challenge on Wednesday when a motion to repeal legal assisted suicide was introduced in Australia &apos;s Northern Territory parliament . 
the 25 members of the Northern Territory &apos;s Legislative Assembly began debating the &quot; Right to Human Life &quot; bill , with opinion divided on whether the euthanasia law would be repealed . 
the territory &apos;s assisted suicide law , allowing terminally-ill patients to end their life by lethal injection or pill if they meet strict conditions , came into force on July 1 but has not yet been used . 
opposition backbencher Neil Bell said he expected his bill to be debated well into Wednesday night in a marathon session and said the assembly was evenly divided on the issue . 
&quot; I can be no more definite than saying it is line ball , &quot; Bell told Reuters by telephone from the territory &apos;s capital Darwin . 
Eric Poole , the territory &apos;s Asian Relations and Industry Minister , has proposed amendments to the euthanasia law to shore up support . 
Poole hoped to have euthanasia disallowed in public hospitals and health clinics to allay fears and misconceptions about the existing law among remote area Aborigines . 
recent government research showed aboriginal opposition to euthanasia was widespread and had resulted in people not seeking medical treatment because of fears they may be killed . 
the Northern Territory Supreme Court last month rejected a challenge brought by a coalition of doctors , church and aboriginal leaders , ruling the law was within the territorial parliament &apos;s power . 
a challenge was expected in Australia &apos;s peak court , the High Court , with euthanasia opponents asking for a ruling on its constitutional validity , legal sources have said . 
euthanasia is illegal in Australia &apos;s six states and one other territory , but doctors admit it occurs unofficially .
