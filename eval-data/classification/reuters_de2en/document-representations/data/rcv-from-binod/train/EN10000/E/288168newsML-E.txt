Bulgaria &apos;s economic crisis is seen worsening as political instability delays implementation of a currency board proposed by the IMF as a last resort to stabilise the crumbling financial system , officals said on Monday . 
&quot; I seriously doubt that the currency board will be introduced on February 1 as the technical preparations needed to make the board operational have not been completed , &quot; central bank board member Nina Micheva told Reuters . 
&quot; The currency board could be introduced in March earliest or more likely in April , &quot; the Monday issue of Kapital business weekly quoted a senior government official as saying . 
a new Socialist cabinet is expected to be formed by mid-month after Prime Minister Zhan Videnov resigned two weeks ago due to what he said was lack of support of his policies . 
the new cabinet will be expected to negotiate implementation of a restrictive fixed exchange rate regime proposed by the International Monetary Fund to restore confidence in the national currency and curb inflation . 
the Lev , which lost 33 percent of its value in the first six days of the year , traded at around 680 to the dollar on Monday . 
under the currency board system , the central bank will not be able to print levs it cannot cover with hard currency reserves , which is expected to remove political pressure from monetary policy . 
the bank will also be banned from lending to the government and commercial banks . 
however legal amendments which would restructure the central bank into four departments and change few articles in the banking and trade laws have not been introduced to parliament for approval so far . 
the budget bill for 1997 approved by the cabinet last week was moved to parliament on Saturday and was already criticised by economists for its unrealistic assumptions . 
&quot; withdrawing the budget bill from parliament and proposing a new one will probably be one of the first tasks of the new cabinet , &quot; said a government official , who declined to be named . 
technically parliament will not be able to pass a realistic 1997 budget before March , the official said . 
the current budget bill assumes a Lev / dollar rate of 500 , the implementation of a currency board and a deficit of 6.9 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) . 
cash-strapped Bulgaria relies entirely on external funding for pending foreign debt payments of $ 300 million due in the first quarter of this year . 
finance Minister Dimitar Kostov has said that $ 130 million coupon payments on Brady bonds issued to restructure Bulgaria &apos;s $ 8.16 billion commercial debt , will be made end-January . 
payments on government securities due in January alone amount to around 100 billion levs most of which will rolled over with new issues , a finance ministry official told Reuters . 
budget revenue is traditionally low in January and most the budget gap will most likely be funded by the central bank , which would further fuel inflation , said Micheva . 
there is no mechanism which would control government funding until the 1997 budget is passed , she added . 
the government has also failed to address the problem of how big state-owned heating and power plants , oil refineries and transport companies will operate under a currency board . 
all of them provide essential services relying on state subsidies . 
reform targets set by the World Bank to restructure part of the state lossmaking enterprises and close others have not been met . 
attempts to stabilise Bulgaria &apos;s ailing banks , most of which currently rely on refinancing from the central bank , have failed so far and their future under a currency board plan is also unclear . 
&quot; After the chaos of the next three months the economy will stop functioning completely , the Lev / dollar rate will be a four digit figure and people &apos;s income will fall not to the existential but to the mathematical minimum , &quot; said Kapital weekly .
