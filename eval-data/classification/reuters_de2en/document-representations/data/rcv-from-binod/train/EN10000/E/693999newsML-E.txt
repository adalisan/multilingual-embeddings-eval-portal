below are analysts &apos; initial reactions to Japan &apos;s industrial production data . 
the Trade Ministry on Friday said May industrial output rose a preliminary 3.8 percent from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis . 
the ministry forecast a 2.6 percent month-on-month fall for June and a 0.9 percent rise for July . 
&quot; May output data confirmed that the economic recovery was driven by the exporting sector . 
but , the weak output forecast for June and July suggested that the Bank of Japan would remain quite wary of a credit tightening as being implied by the BOJ Governor Matsushita today . 
&quot; I think the numbers are very much a surprise at the moment , in the manufacturing sector , on the upside , just as with the tankan the other day . 
&quot; It looks as though manufacturers are steaming through into the second quarter , with the consumption tax going up ( but ) very little impact being felt yet . 
&quot; We ourselves are not looking for a rate hike until the final quarter of this year and we &apos;ll have to review whether we &apos;re still going to go for that forecast . 
but clearly the economy and particularly the manufacturing sector of the economy are coming through much more strongly than people would have thought at the moment . 
&quot; That is partly to do with the weak yen , but it may also be telling us that consumption in underlying terms is very firm , even after the hike in the consumption tax . 
so I think that it will be a factor contributing to the BOJ &apos;s thinking and it may mean that a rate hike could come a little earlier , perhaps in the autumn . 
on market outlook after the figures : &quot; My prediction is that the ( Tokyo ) stock market is going up towards 21,000 and the Japanese yen is going towards 110 yen ( to the dollar ) in the next two-three weeks . 
&quot; It &apos;s a two-tiered economy at the moment . 
the industrial sector is performing extremely well but the BOJ is watching the consumption side of the economy . 
the markets are aware of that . 
&quot; It looks like December , March are the two quarters we &apos;re looking at . 
our opinion here is that we could be waiting as long as March for a hike . 
we do believe that the consumption part of the economy will remain weak for the rest of the year . 
&quot; We do believe that there won &apos;t be very much good news for the consumption side of the economy , which we believe is the key to a rate hike .
