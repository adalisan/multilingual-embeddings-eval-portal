light sweet crude oil continued to firm on Friday in Asia while the Oman differential was traded sharply lower , traders said . 
traders said 300,000 barrels of November Tapis were sold by a producer at quotes plus $ 1.00 to a Singapore refiner . 
this would represent a 10 cent rise in the Tapis differential from the previous deal done by the producer at 90 cents . 
in addition , a major sold 650,000 barrels of Griffin to a South Korean refiner at Tapis quotes less around five cents per barrel . 
but despite the firmer differentials for light sweet crudes , paper Tapis fell slightly on Friday in line with the overnight weakness of Brent and NYMEX futures . 
November Tapis was notionally assessed at $ 22.95 / $ 23.15 per barrel , down around 25 cents from the day-earlier . 
meanwhile , Dubai intermonth spreads were steady heading into the Indian November crude buying tender which is scheduled to be awarded this weekend . 
traders said eight Dubai cargoes were offered at between first half November quotes plus 41 to 55 cents . 
five or six VLCCs of qua Iboe were offered and two cargoes of Gulf OD Suez . 
a national oil company sold 500,000 barrels of mid-October Oman cargo at MPM less 50 cents per barrel to a European major , which traders said could further undermine the differential . 
the market has already moved onto November trading and latest November deals done were at MPM less two cents and Dubai quotes plus 81 to 84 cents , traders said . 
but traders said a handful of October cargos were still looking for buyers although some could be run into refining systems .
