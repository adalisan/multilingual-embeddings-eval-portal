the head of the Italian soccer players &apos; association has appealed to referees to crack down on rough play and asked players to stop faking after England &apos;s Paul INCE was sent off for a foul television showed he did not commit . 
in a letter to Italy &apos;s 2,600 professional players , Sergio Campana said too many of them played &quot; violently ... and faked ( fouls ) , which should never be part of a player &apos;s repertoire and testify to an alarming lack of nerve and maturity &quot; . 
Campana said referees were inconsistent in their punishment of rough play . 
&quot; The referees must be more balanced ... One Sunday they don &apos;t punish rough play , the next one ... they pull out 15 red cards , &quot; he said . 
&quot; More attention must be paid to certain episodes ... I really don &apos;t want to believe that referees in serie A turn a blind eye to some incidents , &quot; Camapana added . 
rough play has characterised several serie A matches this season and many commentators have complained that it was not being punished properly . 
last Sunday England midfielder INCE was sent off during Internazionale &apos;s match against Piacenza after being accused of hitting midfielder Giampietro Piovani on the head during a pause in play . 
but television replays clearly showed that INCE had only waved his hand at Piovani , who fell to the ground writhing in apparent pain . 
Piovani later admitted he had faked the foul . 
the league &apos;s disciplinary commission on Friday reduced to one day a two-match ban that followed the sending-off , saying INCE had not sought to inflict harm and Piovani was not hurt in the incident . 
INCE will miss Sunday &apos;s main match when league leaders Inter travel to Turin to take on European champions Juventus . 
he will be replaced by Swiss international Ciriaco Sforza .
