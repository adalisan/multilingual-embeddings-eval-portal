Austrian far-right leader Joerg Haider said on Sunday convicted child sex offenders should be sent behind bars for life , days after Austrian police detained five men for suspected sexual abuse of children . 
&quot; There must be no mitigation for child abusers , &quot; the leader of the Freedom Party said in a statement released by his office . 
producers of and dealers in child pornography should serve life in prison . 
under Austrian law , sexual abuse of children carries a maximum of ten years in prison . 
producers of child pornography can be sentenced to up to one year , while customers of such materials risk up to six months imprisonment . 
Austrian police on Friday arrested two men for suspected sexual abuse of children aged between four and 15 living in a refugee shelter in the city of Linz . 
two days earlier , Vienna police detained three men on charges of child sex abuse and producing child pornography in a suspected &quot; child-for-hire &quot; network spread across central Europe . 
Austrian police declined to say whether the arrests were connected to the Belgian case of Marc Dutroux , alleged to be the leader of a peadophile pornography ring . 
Dutroux has been named by police in the Slovak capital Bratislava , about one hour &apos;s drive from Vienna , as a suspect in the murder of one Slovak woman and the kidnapping of another .
