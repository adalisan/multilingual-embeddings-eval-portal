Japanese police on Saturday released the full text of a message left by the killer of a decapitated 11-year-old boy in which the murderer says his killing spree has only just started . 
with no signs of a breakthrough in the case after one week of investigation , police decided to publish the full message in the hope that its phrasing might help to identify the killer loose in this western Japanese port . 
since the killing , newspapers have published partial texts of the message . 
written in Japanese on a piece of paper stuffed into the mouth of the slain boy , the full message reads : 
&quot; Now the game begins . 
try and stop me cops . 
my longstanding grudge will be settled by the flow of blood . 
school Kill . 
the message was signed &quot; The School killer . 
other scraps of paper were found in the boy &apos;s mouth with the words &quot; sacred &quot; , &quot; devil &quot; and &quot; fight &quot; on them . 
the head of 11-year-old Jun Hase was found on Tuesday near a middle school where two young schoolgirls were attacked by a knife-wielding man in March . 
one 10-year-old died in that attack . 
a police spokesman said there was no evidence so far that the cases were linked . 
the body of the boy , who disappeared three days earlier after saying he was going to visit his grandfather &apos;s house nearby , was found near the primary school where he was a student . 
there were savage cuts to the boy &apos;s face which police believe were inflicted after he was strangled . 
a police spokesman said forensic evidence indicated the boy was beheaded after he was already dead . 
in a sign of how the grisly crime has gripped the nation , Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has called for a nationwide effort to track down the killer . 
round-the-clock police patrols are in force around Kobe schools and other areas where children gather . 
reports by residents to police of mutilated animals , including a beheaded pigeon and cat , found in the murder area have added to the mood of fear in a suburb of mainly low-income housing estates .
