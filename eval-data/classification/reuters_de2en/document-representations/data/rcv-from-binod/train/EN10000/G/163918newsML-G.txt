Republican Gov. 
William Weld , who has fallen slightly behind incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. John Kerry in recent polls , is set to appeal directly to Massachusetts voters on Monday night with a 30-minute television broadcast on two networks . 
a Boston Globe / WBZ-TV poll on Monday shows Kerry holding on to a razor-thin lead of 48 percent to Weld &apos;s 43 percent with 6 percent undecided . 
the gap is within the KRC Communications Research Inc. poll &apos;s margin of error . 
weld will air a taped half-hour segment on both New England Cable News and WCVB-TV beginning at 8 p.m. est , exactly the same time slot that Texas billionaire and Reform Party presidential candidate Ross Perot is using in his direct message to the voters on a rival station . 
&quot; Perot backed Weld , &quot; noted Brandeis University political science professor Jeffrey Abramson . 
&quot; Now , they &apos;re competing against each other for the same audience . 
&quot; I don &apos;t know if he ( Weld ) will be getting any undecideds from the broadcast , but it makes sense that if you have the money at this point and the race is this close , then you have nothing to lose , &quot; Abramson said . 
the Federal Election Commission &apos;s latest report showed Weld had $ 660,000 in cash on hand &quot; and I &apos;m sure he &apos;s raised more , &quot; said Jim Glaser , a political science professor at Tufts University . 
&quot; If he didn &apos;t do this and lost , then Weld would be kicking himself . 
but Northeastern University political science professor Alan Schroeder said the 30-minute buy probably will not bring in any more votes and &quot; smacks of desperation ... 
I think most people have tuned off the election process at this point . 
the barrage of political advertising has deadened everyone &apos;s nerves and whether it &apos;s a 30-second , a 60-second or a 30-minute spot , it will probably fall on deaf ears . 
in the meantime , both Weld and Kerry were criss-crossing the state to get out their supporters . 
Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin has estimated 76 percent of registered voters in the state would cast ballots on Tuesday -- down from the 1992 presidential high of 84.22 percent . 
&quot; Part of that is we now have a record number of registered voters with the motor-voter law . 
so while we may get more people voting , it won &apos;t be a higher percentage , &quot; explained Glavin &apos;s spokesman , John McCarthy . 
he said 3.494 million voters were registered for Tuesday &apos;s election , as opposed to 3.351 million registered for the 1992 election .
