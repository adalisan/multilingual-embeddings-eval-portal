Danish share prices closed lower on Tuesday in a calm market hit like the rest of Europe by the U.S. missile attack on Iraq , with dealers uncertain about the way ahead and watching out for Wall Street &apos;s reaction . 
&quot; It was a quiet day despite the U.S.-Iraq crisis . 
tonight &apos;s Dow Jones and the Wall Street reaction to the Iraq strike will determine how things go here tomorrow , &quot; one dealer said . 
the KFX top-20 index closed 0.89 point down at 119.40 while the KFX September future fell 0.30 point to 119.70 with 706 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded . 
profit-taking hit the two top banks , leaving Den Danske Bank six crowns down at 405 at the close with rival Unibank shedding three crowns to 254 while BG Bank finished unchanged at 210 . 
FLS was one of the few KFX shares to buck the downward trend , continuing its post-interim result advance and ending the day 25 crowns higher at 680 . 
ISS continued its upward march too , putting on two crowns to 154 while Tele Danmark was the day &apos;s most traded paper with 330,000 shares changing hands to close five crowns lower at 281 .
