Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said on Sunday he would delay implementing the oil-for-food plan for Iraq because of the deteriorating situation in the north . 
the U.N. secretary-general , in a statement , said he would postpone deploying certain personnel who were necessary to supervise the implementation of Resolution 986 , which sets out conditions for the plan . 
the program had been expected to go into effect shortly after Boutros-Ghali had assured the Security Council that all arrangements were in place . 
the oil-for-food plan allows Iraq to sell $ 2 billion worth of petroleum over six months to purchase food , medicine and other goods for its people suffering under sanctions imposed after Baghdad &apos;s troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990 . 
Iraq , according to U.S. officials , amassed 30,000-40,000 troops this week in northern Kurdish provinces and captured the city of Arbil , expelling one Kurdish faction and installing a rival group more favourable to Baghdad . 
in a statement issued by the United Nations through a spokesman , Boutros-Ghali was &quot; very much concerned about the deterioration of the situation in northern Iraq . 
in light of developments there , he has decided to delay the deployment of certain personnel who will supervise the implementation of Resolution 986 . 
&quot; He is following the situation closely , and he is in continuing contact with the United Nations coordinator in Baghdad , &quot; the statement said , adding that Boutros-Ghali had been assured that all U.N. personnel in northern Iraq were safe .
