the OSCE chairman-in-office said on Thursday a power struggle in Bosnia &apos;s Serb republic must not undermine post-war regional elections planned for September . 
&quot; The technical preparations for the elections are on track . 
however , the political climate is still a cause for concern , &quot; Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said in a speech to the permanent council of Europe &apos;s top security body . 
&quot; In this context , I wish to stress that the present political crisis in Republika Srpska must not be allowed to jeopardise the preparation and holding of municipal elections . 
the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe is organising the September 13-14 vote in Bosnia against a backdrop of heightened tension between Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic and nationalist hardliners . 
Plavsic is trying to dissolve parliament to reduce the influence of ultra-nationalists who ran the Serb war machine , led by former president and indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic . 
Petersen told a news conference he was optimistic the elections would go ahead despite recent bombings apparently directed against international monitors . 
the attacks , which have injured no one , followed a NATO raid last week on suspected war criminals in which a Serb man was arrested and another shot dead after he fired on British soldiers moving in to apprehend him . 
&quot; I think we have a good chance of conducting the elections in a fair way and certainly the OSCE will continue to do its job . 
I do not expect this task to be made more difficult by recent events , &quot; Petersen said . 
&quot; Some special procedures have been introduced . 
the OSCE sees no great threat to its personnel , &quot; Petersen added . 
he did not specify the procedures . 
representatives of international peace implementation agencies in Bosnia have said they have taken precautionary steps to minimise risks when travelling through and working in Serb territory . 
the regional elections , covering the Moslem-Croat federation and Serb republic zones of Bosnia , were originally scheduled in September 1996 but postponed because of rampant irregularities in voter registration in Serb areas .
