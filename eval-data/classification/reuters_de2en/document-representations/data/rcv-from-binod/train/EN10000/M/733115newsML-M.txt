* Canada &apos;s dollar opened weaker at C $ 1.3727 ( US $ 0.7285 ) as some hedge funds took profits on recent gains in the currency in heavy overnight trading . 
* Dealers said the outlook for the dollar is still positive long-term , but near-term it could test support levels . 
* The market is now seen focusing on U.S. CPI numbers out this morning . 
both the overall index and index less food and energy prices are expected to show a rise of 0.2 percent . 
a stronger-than-expected figure is expected to weaken the Canadian dollar , as it would increase the likelihood of a U.S. interest rate hike . 
however , dealers said investors remain positive on the unit &apos;s longer-term prospects . 
&quot; The market is probably generally long Canada , &quot; said the dealer . 
&quot; For the moment Canada may come under a little bit of pressure . 
I still think if you &apos;re going long Canada that you &apos;ve got to pick your levels . 
on the crosses , the Canadian dollar fell against the German mark to 1.3034 marks from 1.3078 marks at Tuesday &apos;s close , and fell to 84.27 Japanese yen from 84.39 yen .
