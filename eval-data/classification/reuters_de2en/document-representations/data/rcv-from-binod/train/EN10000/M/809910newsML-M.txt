German call money eased slightly on Tuesday with the market finding sufficient liquidity and relieved that , as expected , the Bundesbank announced another fixed rate , 3.0 percent repo . 
traders said the central call money rate slipped to 3.07 percent in morning trade from 3.08 percent on Monday as the Bundesbank reported that credit institutions held a touch more funds with the central bank on Monday . 
many dismissed Bundesbank council member Hans-Juergen Krupp &apos;s comments on Monday night when he said an interest rate increase would hurt the economy . 
one analyst noted Krupp is considered a dove on the policy-making council and it was not surprising he was opposed to lifting rates . 
traders said the market is now focusing on Wednesday &apos;s repo allocation when 74.7 billion marks of repos expires . 
traders said they expected the Bundesbank to drain a small amount of funds from the banking market at the allocation . 
credit institutions held 42.6 billion marks with the Bundesbank on Monday , up from 42.5 billion marks . 
the average for the month so far stood at 40.6 billion marks compared with 40.5 billion marks . 
banks did not borrow an appreciable amount of funds from the emergency Lombard lending facility . 
the Frankfurt Interbank overnight average ( Fiona ) rate stood at 3.08525 percent on Tuesday compared with 3.09600 percent on Monday .
