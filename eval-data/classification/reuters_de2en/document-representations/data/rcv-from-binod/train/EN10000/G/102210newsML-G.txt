Czech President Vaclav Havel summoned government leaders to talks on Tuesday on relations with Germany amid signs that a historic declaration aimed at closing the book on World War Two may be made soon . 
Havel will meet Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus , Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec , leaders of the two junior coalition partners and opposition Social Democrat chief Milos Zeman on Thursday , said presidential spokesman Ladislav Spacek . 
&quot; The purpose of this consultation is to assess the current discussions on the Czech-German declaration and to decide on the next steps , &quot; he said in a statement . 
also invited is Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra , Prague &apos;s chief negotiator with Bonn on the declaration , which is supposed to be issued by the Czech and German parliaments . 
the Czech Republic is the only remaining victim of Nazi occupation not to have come to terms with Germany . 
negotiations on the declaration have dragged on for more than a year , bedevilled by political pressures particularly in Germany . 
Prague says the text has been completed and the problem now lies with Bonn where members of the Sudeten German community , expelled en masse from the former Czechoslovakia after the war , have made a series of demands holding up the text &apos;s approval . 
the statement gave no explicit indication that the laborious treaty process was nearing its end . 
but a road block seemed to disappear last month when Chancellor Helmut Kohl , the dominant figure in German politics , said he hoped it could be signed before the end of the year . 
the Czech government and moderate opposition agree on the the need to settle the issue , which Sudeten leaders have threatened to use to block Czech ambitions to join the European Union . 
the declaration seeks to address Czech memories of the 1938-1945 Nazi occupation and German memories of the indiscriminate expulsion of 2.5 million Sudetens for supporting Hitler , authorised by the victorious World War Two allies . 
Havel has said that it was wrong to hold the Sudetens collectively guilty as some -- albeit a minority -- had remained loyal to the democratic Czechoslovak state . 
the agreement is also expected to regulate issues of property and compensation for Czech victims of Nazism and the Sudetens . 
however , Havel has ruled out returning any property confiscated from Sudetens by presidential decree in the 1940s .
