a large bloc sale on National Bank on Sunday helped buttress the Amman bourse amid signs of an upward trend on popular blue-chips sparked by so far limited foreign buying , dealers said . 
&quot; The market is generally stable with a slight improvement on certain stock , &quot; said senior analyst Mohammmed Abdullah , Pearl Consulting . 
the official 60-share Amman Financial Market ( AFM ) index rose 0.46 percent to 159.32 points in healthy turnover of 1.9 million dinars ( $ 2.7 million ) . 
more than half the value of daily trade was dominated by a bloc sale in Jordan National Bank , which rose 0.03 dinars to 2.12 dinars in a deal possibly executed by foreign buyers . 
brokers say the bourse is generally stable amid growing foreign interest which resurfaced since Saturday and could signal the start of a repeat pattern of select bargain buying on cement and mining firms which the bourse witnessed last month . 
prices have eased since gaining nearly six percent in the final week of May on the back of foreign fund buying .
