the glory of the Soviet military lived again on Friday as 5,000 Russian cadets paraded on Red Square with old red communist flags to mark the 52nd anniversary of victory in World War Two . 
&quot; A Victory Day military parade on Red Square is a symbol of Russian soldiers &apos; loyalty to the tradition of the Great Patriotic War heroes , &quot; President Boris Yeltsin said in a short speech to troops , veterans and other invited guests . 
&quot; It is the sacred duty of the Russian army to preserve and augment these traditions , &quot; he said on a mild spring morning . 
many Russian veterans of the war that killed 27 million Soviet people wore their old uniforms , glimmering with medals that tinkled as they gathered on the parade review stand beside the Kremlin walls . 
from the square , the sound of soldiers &apos; heels knocking against the cobbled stones echoed as they paraded to the strains of a massive military band . 
once assembled , soldiers in waves cried out &quot; Hurrah &quot; , creating a cascade of sound ending around the coloured onion domes of St Basil &apos;s Cathedral . 
soldiers heading up marching units bore banners of Soviet revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin and the wartime slogan &quot; For our Soviet motherland &quot; . 
the shine of a successful parade gave the Russian military a rare upbeat moment at a time when poor funding and low morale make the nuclear-equipped force a shadow of its former glory . 
young Russians are draft-dodging in huge numbers , and even officers are often paid months late . 
in Vladivostok , the Pacific Fleet cancelled a naval parade for the first time since 1945 because of lack of funding , Itar-Tass news agency reported . 
the rare Red Square parade revived a tradition that once embodied Soviet military power , but the Kremlin did not roll out the rockets and tanks that were once an integral part of such events . 
&quot; parades have become so rare today . 
it &apos;s great to see these young soldiers showing their strength to the people , &quot; said Nina Kiselyova , 72 , who dug ditches during the war . 
but Georgy Dyomin , 75 , who recalled his first full-scale military parade in 1938 , said he missed the big guns : &quot; Of course it &apos;s better when you have all the weaponry , it creates a more celebratory atmosphere and it is more impressive . 
the excitement was too much for at least six veterans carried off by ambulance , but no serious injuries were reported . 
cities across the former Soviet Union also celebrated Victory Day , a widely popular event perhaps because it marks one of the few lasting accomplishments of the communist years . 
some cities such as Volgograd ( formerly Stalingrad ) and the Kazakh capital Almaty set up field canteens offering soldiers &apos; fare such as buckwheat porridge , although many preferred the makeshift cafes serving vodka and national dishes . 
more than 2,000 pro-Russian communists formed a human chain in the Ukrainian port of Sevastopol to protest NATO plans to expand the alliance into the eastern European countries liberated by Soviet troops at the end of World War Two . 
at least 15,000 participated in a communist-sponsored rally in Moscow that also condemned NATO expansion . 
&quot; The people of Europe are in eternal debt to the Soviet Union , &quot; said Vasily Golubev , 85 , who wore a gold Hero of the Soviet Union star won for helping defend Leningrad ( now St Petersburg ) under Nazi siege . 
&quot; We let the Warsaw Pact end .
