the Australian dollar was hounded to fresh 11-month lows Friday as U.S. and Japanese investors dumped it in fear of an imminent rate cut here . 
the currency shed 1 / 2 cent offshore and went on to lose a matching amount in the local day as relentless selling drove it toward 76 cents . 
the slide brought its losses to six cents or over seven percent since it topped at US $ 0.8212 in December . 
so bearish had the market become that a surprisingly low December current account deficit provided not a whif of support . 
still , some felt the gloom had gone too far and the risk / reward ratio did not favour going aggressively short at these levels . 
this was its lowest local finish since March 5 , 1996 and marked a weekly close beneath three-year old trendline support at US $ 0.7660 , a very bearish development as far as chart watchers were concerned . 
many saw its downtrend extending to 75 cents in the medium term and could not rule out a re-test of last year &apos;s 73 cent low . 
traders said the selling was again led by Japanese investors paring long positions built up last year yen / A $ dual currency samurai bonds were all the rage . 
that took the dollar down to 92.80 / 90 yen from an early 93.20 / 30 and 93.70 / 80 late here Thursday . 
the currency also lost ground on the European crosses , which contributed to a 0.7 point drop in trade weighted terms to 58.1 . 
however , they emphasised the local dollar was in historical terms very strong on most crosses having touched a 4-1 / 2 year high on the yen around 94.80 just a day ago and multi-month peaks on the mark and Swiss franc earlier in the week . 
&quot; sure the AUD &apos;s dropped a long way on the U.S. dollar , but then so has every other currency in the world , &quot; said one . 
all that might change , however , if the Reserve Bank decided to ease for a fourth time at its board meeting next week . 
policy has already been eased by 150 basis points which in turn shaved the dollar &apos;s yield premium to levels where offshore investors had begun switching to competing high yielders . 
in particular the huge flow of Japanese funds into yen / A $ samurais , which played a major part in the dollar &apos;s rise last year , has dried up and US $ issues had come into favour . 
Nomura provided a sign of things to come by offering Japanese retail investors dual currency samurai bonds backed by U.S. Treasury bills , the first kind of this type . 
the muted impact of the current account improvement showed just how obsessed the market was with the risk of another cut . 
that was well below forecasts of A $ 1.78 billion and brought an end to a five month run of widening shortfalls . 
the improvement was largely due to an eight percent jump in exports which boded well for containing the deficit below A $ 2 billion a month . 
analysts are divided on whether the RBA will indeed ease after its board meeting next Tuesday and see scope for a short covering bounce in the dollar if it does hold steady . 
however , any rally was likely to be restrained since speculation would merely shift to the March board meeting and it would take some strong economic or wages data to still the talk . 
traders also face the threat , no matter how slim , of a Federal Reserve hike after its committee meeting on February 4-5 . 
the possibility of the RBA easing and the Fed tightening on the same day is not one A $ bulls care to think about .
