lab experiments suggest a new synthetic vitamin D compound may help fight cancer without the dangerous side effects associated with other forms of vitamin D , researchers said on Tuesday . 
the synthesized vitamin D-5 compound inhibited cancer growth in several laboratory experiments . 
further study is needed in the lab and on animals before scientists can test it in humans , cancer researcher Rajendra Mehta said . 
Mehta and colleagues at the University of Illinois in Chicago report their findings in the Feb . 5 edition of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute . 
the natural form of vitamin D-3 has been shown to fight cancer in lab studies but large doses can raise blood calcium levels to dangerous , potentially fatal , levels in people . 
so scientists have been looking for variants that can fight cancer without elevating calcium . 
several studies are under way on variants of Vitamin D-3 . 
Mehta and his team , however , developed a synthesized D-5 . 
he said in a telephone interview that he is studying whether the compound has the most potential for treating cancer , for preventing cancer , or both . 
Mehta compared various doses of D-3 and D-5 in cancer cell cultures . 
both of them inhibited cancer formation but D-5 did so without toxic calcium levels . 
in addition , he found evidence that D-5 stimulated a growth factor , transforming growth factor Beta-1 , believed to thwart cancer cell growth . 
an editorial in the journal by two University of California at Los Angeles cancer experts , Moray Campbell and Dr. Phillip Koeffler , said that this &quot; entirely novel class of vitamin D compounds &quot; warrants more research .
