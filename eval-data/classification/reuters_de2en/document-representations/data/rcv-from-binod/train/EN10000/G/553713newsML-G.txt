the United States voiced &quot; increasing apprehension &quot; on Thursday over Belarus &apos; handling of the Soros Foundation , a development organisation recently presented with a $ 3 million tax bill by the Minsk government . 
in the latest sign of tension between Washington and Minsk , State Department spokesman John Dinger told reporters Belarus &apos; stance in this matter would be a sign of its attitude toward all non-governmental organisations . 
&quot; Belarus &apos; subsequent actions in this case will make clear its attitude toward organisations like the foundation that aim to build a civil society based on respect for law , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We call upon Belarus not to pursue actions that will further deepen its isolation . 
the Belarussian branch of the Soros organisation , set up by philanthropic tycoon George Soros to help post-Communist societies , said in a statement that it had been told to pay the equivalent of almost $ 3 million in taxes despite the fact that it was awarded tax-free status in 1995 . 
the foundation said that represented half of its spending in Belarus last year . 
over four years the fund has donated $ 13 million to educational , ecological and cultural programmes . 
Dinger noted that the foundation had been targeted previously , in March , when its U.S. citizen director was first held incommunicado and then barred from the country . 
relations between the two countries have worsened over the last several months , especially after a U.S. diplomat was expelled and Ambassador Kenneth Yalowitz was recalled to Washington for consultations on March 25 . 
Yalowitz returned to Minsk on Wednesday , bringing what the embassy said was a tough message about the government &apos;s &quot; abysmal human rights record . 
Washington has repeatedly condemned what State Department spokesmen call the &quot; authoritarian &quot; policies of President Alexander Lukashenko , who has clamped down on opposition to his rule and on those opposed to his closer union with Russia .
