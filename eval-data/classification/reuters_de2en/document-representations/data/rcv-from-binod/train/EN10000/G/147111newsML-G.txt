a plot to kill Mali &apos;s president , Alpha Oumar Konare , his prime minister and his defence minister has been uncovered and the plotters identified and arrested , a source close to the government said on Monday . 
one of the plotters , who included an air force officer , other ranks in the armed forces and a civilian , was linked to ousted dictator Moussa Troare , who was toppled in 1991 , the source added . 
Traore has been in jail since his overthrow . 
the source said plot was uncovered between Sunday night and Monday morning . 
investigations were continuing , the source added . 
sources close to the armed forces ministry said the plotters were an &quot; isolated group &quot; . 
Troare was sentenced to death for murder in 1993 in connection with the repression of a 1991 democracy protest during which security forces killed more than 100 people , mostly students . 
he has remained in jail since . 
Konare , a historian , was elected in 1992 during Mali &apos;s successful democratic transition . 
Mali holds presidential , legislative and municipal elections early in 1997 . 
the elections will be the first test of its fledgling democracy , introduced after the overthrow of Traore .
