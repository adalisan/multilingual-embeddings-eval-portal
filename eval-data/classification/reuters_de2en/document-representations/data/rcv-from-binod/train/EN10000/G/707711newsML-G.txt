an opposition jet flew over Kabul on Friday night after an opposition commander said that Taleban air raids on a northern town had killed 90 people in the past two days , including 40 Taleban prisoners . 
anti-aircraft and machine-gun fire lit up the night sky as Taleban fighters took aim at the aircraft . 
several loud explosions were heard , but it was not immediately clear if the jet had bombed the city . 
the Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press ( AIP ) earlier quoted opposition commander General Fauzi ( one name ) as saying Taleban air raids on Maimana , capital of the northwestern province of Maimana , had left 90 people dead since Thursday . 
Fauzi said 40 Taleban prisoners had been killed and 30 wounded when Maimana prison was bombed on Friday . 
he said Taleban Foreign Minister Mullah Mohammad Ghous and Civil Aviation Minister Maulvi Akhter Mohammad Mansoor were among the wounded . 
one bomb had also landed near a mosque and one hit a clinic , wounding women and children . 
a senior Taleban official , Wakil Ahmad , told AIP that the Taleban had bombed Maimana , but said the purist Islamic militia &apos;s planes had hit only military targets . 
he said Taleban prisoners captured in the northern capital of Mazar-i-Sharif in late May had been moved to Maimana at one point , but had later been shifted to another town , Shibergan , about 120 km ( 75 miles ) northeast of Maimana . 
the Taleban consul in the Pakistani border city of Peshawar said an exchange of messages in the last few days had indicated that Ghous and other Taleban captives were in Shibergan . 
&quot; This is a plan to kill these people , &quot; he said of Fauzi &apos;s report of Taleban casualties caused by the militia &apos;s own planes . 
there was no independent confirmation of the reported bombing raids and casualties in Maimana . 
Maimana is the home town of ethnic Uzbek opposition leader General Abdul Malik , whose troops expelled the Taleban from Mazar-i-Sharif in May after initially allying with them to oust former northern opposition leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum . 
the authorities in Mazar-i-Sharif announced on Friday that they were closing Pakistan &apos;s consulate there , AIP said . 
the agency said Malik had said the people of Mazar-i-Sharif were angry at what he called Pakistan &apos;s support for the Taleban , so he had decided to shut the consulate temporarily as a security precaution in case it came under attack . 
remaining consulate staff should leave for their own safety , he was quoted as saying . 
all Pakistani diplomats were evacuated from Mazar-i-Sharif at the end of May . 
no immediate comment from Pakistani officials was available . 
Pakistan became the first country formally to recognise the Taleban government in Kabul on May 25 , the day after Taleban fighters moved into Mazar-i-Sharif with Malik &apos;s help . 
Pakistan has denied backing the Taleban , who captured Kabul in September . 
Islamabad says it is trying to promote dialogue among Afghans to bring peace to the war-shattered country . 
Malik &apos;s Uzbek troops and their allies in the Shi &apos;ite Moslem Hezb-i-Wahdat militia took hundreds of Taleban prisoners during a bloody 15-hour street battle in Mazar-i-Sharif in late May . 
several Taleban leaders , including Foreign Minister Ghous , Civil Aviation Minister Mansoor , central bank governor Mullah Ahsanullah and northern military commander Mullah Abdul Razzak , fell into Malik &apos;s hands . 
the Taleban have insisted that the prisoners , particularly the important figures among them , should be released as a precondition for peace talks with the opposition . 
Malik has in the past warned the Taleban that his prisoners could fare badly if the Taleban bombed northern cities .
