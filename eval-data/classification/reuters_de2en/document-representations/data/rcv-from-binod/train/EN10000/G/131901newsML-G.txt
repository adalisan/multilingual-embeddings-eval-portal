nearly 10 years after a racially-inspired coup set Fiji on a path of ethnic division , the island nation has reached a fork in that road . 
Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka , who as military commander staged the 1987 coup , is leading a parliamentary committee working on a new constitution to replace the racially-biased document he introduced after the coup . 
but nationalists in Fiji , and even some members of Rabuka &apos;s cabinet , oppose changing the constitution , which guarantees native Fijians a majority in the 70-seat parliament . 
&quot; I think this is Fiji &apos;s last chance for a very long time . 
I think this really , truly is the crossroads , &quot; said JAI Ram Reddy , head of the opposition National Federation Party , which represents Fiji &apos;s large ethnic Indian population . 
&quot; Fiji must chose stability or instability , peace and harmony or social discontent , &quot; Reddy told Reuters in an interview . 
an independent constitutional review released in September called for an end to indigenous political supremacy , proposing a new 70-seat parliament with 45 non-ethnic seats . 
when the review was presented to the parliament Rabuka welcomed it with calls for consensus . 
but earlier this month , when the constitutional parliamentary committee held its first meeting , Rabuka stressed indigenous rights must remain a priority , quoting from a United Nations declaration on indigenous rights . 
&quot; We must , throughout , keep our focus on the realities of Fiji , &quot; Rabuka said . 
&quot; Not everyone gets what everyone desires in this type of exercise , &quot; Rabuka warned . 
such remarks create anxiety in Fiji &apos;s Indian community which makes up about 46 percent of the 750,000 population . 
Indians were brought to Fiji at the turn of the century to work the sugar cane plantations . 
descendants of those labourers now dominate the sugar industry , Fiji &apos;s economic backbone , and hold many senior posts in business , the professions and the civil service . 
but those who know Rabuka say these contradictory public statements are not to be taken as government policy . 
&quot; One of his traits is his inconsistencies , &quot; said Samisoni Kakaivalu , editor of the Fiji Times newspaper . 
&quot; He says something today and the next day he contradicts himself . 
every now and then he makes these utterances and it brings back suspicions and distrust , &quot; says Kakaivalu . 
but whatever Rabuka &apos;s true position is on the constitution , one thing is sure -- he faces opposition to change . 
Sakeasi Butadroka , leader of the radical but unelected Fijian Nationalist Party , supports the present constitution , arguing it is needed to help indigenous Fijians develop . 
&quot; Indians and Asians have civilised blood in them because when they were civilised , we were still cannibals . 
we need to be left alone to compete among ourselves , &quot; says Butabroka , adding that those who disagree with his views should leave the country . 
Reddy , a third-generation Indian Fijian , said he feels &quot; deeply hurt &quot; when people say Fiji is not his country . 
this is my home , &quot; he says . 
views similar to Butadroka &apos;s aren &apos;t widely supported , even among native Fijians . 
the radical grassroots nationalist movement Taukei , which backed Rabuka in 1987 when he toppled an Indian-dominated government , has the support of only about five percent of native Fijians , Kakaivalu estimates . 
but Kakaivalu , Reddy and business leaders say opposition to a balanced constitution is also coming from within the government . 
the uncertainty over Fiji &apos;s political future has dampened the economy , say business leaders . 
although the government is forecasting around four percent growth in the 1996 calendar year , this is inflated by new gold mining activity and good sugar returns . 
the economy is probably growing at around two percent , and many small businesses are struggling to survive as consumer spending dries up and investment plans are put on hold , business leaders say . 
&quot; The Fiji Times can feel it . 
advertising and classifieds are down and newspaper sales are down , &quot; says Kakaivalu . 
Rabuka and his government face another dilemma over the issue of native land leased to predominantly Indian sugar farmers . 
the farms &apos; 30-year leases start to expire early next year and Rabuka has yet to announce new land-lease laws . 
Reddy says without a fairer constitution Fiji &apos;s economy will worsen , resulting in social unrest . 
he also warns of another exodus of Indian Fijians , historically Fiji &apos;s main source of domestic investment . 
between 70,000 and 80,000 have already left since the 1987 coup . 
&quot; He ( Rabuka ) doesn &apos;t want a constitution that will force most of the Indian investors out of this country , &quot; says Kakaivalu . 
&quot; That will be the end of Fiji .
