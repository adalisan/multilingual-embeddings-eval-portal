Singapore shares lost ground on Wednesday morning following an overnight fall on Wall Street . 
dealers said early institutional demand was thin and a series of U.S. buy orders , executed earlier in the week , appeared to have been completed . 
&quot; The overall market is fairly quiet . 
I think most of the programme buying is done , &quot; said one broker . 
by 0150 GMT , Singapore &apos;s 30-share Straits Times Industrials Index was 13.98 points lower at 2,098.99 with a relatively low 19.8 million shares changing hands . 
twenty-eight shares rose and 99 fell . 
new York &apos;s Dow Jones Industrial average fell 18.54 overnight to close at 7,274.21 points . 
dealers said they expected consolidation rather than heavy price falls for the rest of the day in Singapore . 
&quot; You may see some switching , but I don &apos;t see too much selling , &quot; said a dealer . 
shipping company osprey Maritime was an early gainer , rising 16 cents to Singapore $ 2.32 after news of a US $ 750 million takeover of oil and gas carrier Gataas-Larsen Shipping .
