British explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes abandoned his attempt to become the first man to walk solo and unaided across Antarctica and was on his way home on Thursday after suffering from kidney stones . 
the sponsors of the polar expedition said the 53-year-old adventurer activated his satellite location beacon for an immediate rescue on Wednesday . 
&quot; Sir Ranulph has been in excruciating pain for the last 48 hours suffering from kidney stones , &quot; Dysons said in a statement . 
Fiennes , who had been dragging 500 pounds ( 226.8 kilogram ) of supplies and equipment on a sledge in temperatures as low as -20C ( -4F ) in aid of cancer research , had completed a quarter of his 1,800 mile ( 2,897 km ) , 110-day trek across Antarctica when he radioed for assistance . 
get me out , &quot; he said in his distress call . 
Fiennes , a former member of the Special Air Service elite commando unit , made a similar trek across Antarctica in 1992 with a companion . 
during the trip he lost a third of his body weight and nearly lost some toes to frostbite . 
he had previously completed several expeditions to the North and South Poles and was named &quot; World &apos;s greatest Living explorer &quot; by the Guinness Book of Records in 1984 .
