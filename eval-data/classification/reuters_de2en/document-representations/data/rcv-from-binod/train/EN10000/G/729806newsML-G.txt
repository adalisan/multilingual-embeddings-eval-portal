Indian police tightened security in the capital on Tuesday after bombs ripped through two buses in the city , injuring at least 20 people . 
the blasts occurred within 10 minutes of each other close to the historic Red Fort in Delhi &apos;s old quarter on Monday . 
&quot; All the police patrol vans have become more vigilant and the security drill has been tightened , &quot; Duli Ram , a Delhi police spokesman , said . 
a bomb disposal squad officer told Reuters that crude bombs were apparently used . 
while forensic experts sifted through the wreckage , police mounted a tight security operation in the area in preparation for a rally on Tuesday by Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) president L.K. 
Advani . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think the bomb blasts had anything to do with the BJP rally , &quot; Delhi &apos;s Commissioner of Police , Tilak Raj Kakkar , told Reuters . 
Kakkar said no one had claimed responsibility for Monday &apos;s blasts . 
Kashmiri separatist guerrillas fighting against Indian rule in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir have in the past claimed responsibility for bomb blasts in New Delhi . 
Monday &apos;s attack came after a train bombing in the nearby state of Punjab last week . 
thirty-three people were killed and 64 injured in that attack . 
Punjab was rocked by a Sikh separatist movement in the 1980s . 
more than 20,000 people have died in Punjab since 1984 when discontent with New Delhi turned into armed insurrection .
