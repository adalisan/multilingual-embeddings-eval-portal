a conference on how television airtime is sold in Britain sparked questions over the continuing relevance of the traditional selling mechanism , an advertising trade group said on Monday . 
the Incorporated Society of British advertisers ( ISBA ) sponsored the seminar for 40 advertisers , broadcasters and media buyers in the wake of a recent dispute between UK television sales houses and a media buying network . 
&quot; It was designed to kick-start an intelligent , open dialogue , &quot; Bob Wootton , director of media services for ISBA , told Reuters . 
&quot; There is definitely a need for clients to take media trading more seriously and make themselves better aware of the key issues . 
&quot; In particular , clients were urged to question their agencies on the deals which were struck on their behalf , &quot; ISBA said . 
television airtime in Britain is sold via the station average price , which is related to a broadcaster &apos;s audience revenue and the share an advertiser spends . 
because TV stations grant discounts for volume purchases of airtime , media buyers typically bundle together the advertising revenues of multiple clients to promise large blocks of business to broadcasters in order to negotiate the best rate . 
CIA Medianetwork , part of CIA Group plc , in January agreed to pay a total of 1.8 million pounds to settle a dispute with sales contractors for Britain &apos;s Independent Television Network ( ITV ) after failing to deliver the volume of advertising it had said would deliver . 
ISBA said seminar participants urged broadcasters to shift their emphasis from the sale of discount to the sale of their product -- audience supply . 
&quot; Station average price is the benchmark against which all airtime is traded , &quot; Wootton said . 
&quot; It has its roots in the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s when ITV had a monopoly . 
quite a lot of people are questioning its relevance &quot; in a time of growing commercial television choices , he said .
