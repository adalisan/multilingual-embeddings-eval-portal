the Clinton administration , preparing for next week &apos;s presidential trip to Mexico , Central America and the Caribbean , is defending its trade record , but analysts warn that the United States is losing ground because it still lacks &quot; fast track &quot; authority for trade deals . 
&quot; I think this administration &apos;s trade record in the first term has been a very strong one , including the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , &quot; said President Bill Clinton &apos;s special adviser for Latin America , Thomas McLarty . 
McLarty , a former White House Chief-of-Staff , also pointed to the 1994 Summit of the Americas Clinton hosted in Miami , where the 34 countries represented launched a project of forging a hemispheric free trade agreement by 2005 . 
at that summit the three NAFTA partners , the United States , Mexico and Canada , offered Chile the chance to become the fourth member . 
the United States , however , has not been able to make good on that invitation because it lacks &quot; fast track , &quot; a key authorisation from Congress to negotiate new trade deals . 
Treaties signed under that legislation cannot be amended by Congress , which must vote them up or down in a short time . 
U.S. analysts argue that the lack of &quot; fast track &quot; has kept the United States on the sidelines and strengthened the hand of Brazil , the leading voice in the MERCOSUR South American common market agreement . 
while NAFTA has not expanded since it started in 1994 , MERCOSUR has struck deals with Chile and Bolivia and is in talks with other South American nations and the European Union . 
&quot; If we drop the ball , the United States &apos; credibility will be shattered , &quot; said Richard Feinberg , dean of the University of California at San Diego &apos;s graduate School of International Relations and Pacific Studies . 
&quot; That will result not only in stalling integration but it will also affect all other areas of cooperation , because trade is the grease of this process , &quot; said Feinberg , who was Clinton &apos;s Latin America specialist in the National Security Council . 
C. Fred Bergsten , director of the Washington-based Institute for International Economics , noted that Brazil has always had a strong domestic constituency rooting for protectionism and economic dominance in South America . 
&quot; If the United States falters , &quot; said Bergsten , &quot; the paradoxical result of the summit of Miami will be the enhancement of Brazil &apos;s leadership . 
while the White House acknowledges that the stakes are high , it argues that having &quot; fast track &quot; at this point is not as crucial as it will be in October , when Clinton is due to visit Brazil and Argentina , Mercosur &apos;s main partners , and Venezuela . 
McLarty pointed out that Mexico already is in NAFTA and the third biggest U.S. trading partner , while Central American and Caribbean nations are more interested in the Caribbean Basin Initiative , a pact that grants preferences to their exports to the United States . 
nevertheless , he said Clinton will be speaking frequently about the need to expand trade , hammering on the fact that the United States must hold natural markets like Latin America . 
in the meantime , his negotiators like U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky will continue to hold talks with the Republican majority in Congress to try to find common ground on &quot; fast track &quot; authority . 
&quot; Our approach is to build a critical mass , a bipartisan consensus that will support &apos; fast track &apos; legislation , &quot; McLarty said . 
Republicans , however , voiced doubts about the administration &apos;s intentions and wondered if Democratic presidential politics were not muddling the process . 
House of Representatives minority leader Richard Gephardt , a potential contender for the Democratic nomination together with Vice President Al Gore , has spoken against expanding NAFTA . 
championing two key Democratic issues , the White House has long insisted on including the authority to negotiate labour and environmental issues in &quot; fast track &quot; legislation . 
Republicans said they now agree to include any trade-related issues , but complained that the administration still has not come forward with a proposal . 
Arizona Republican Representative Jim Kolbe , a leading free trade advocate , warned that the window of opportunity for approving &quot; fast track &quot; was growing narrower . 
&quot; We can &apos;t expect to get &apos; fast track &apos; this year if we don &apos;t get it by the August recess , &quot; Kolbe told reporters .
