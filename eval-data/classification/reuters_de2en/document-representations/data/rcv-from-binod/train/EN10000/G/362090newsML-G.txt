Saudi Arabia on Thursday warned pilgrims they would face tough punishment if they carried political material at the annual Moslem pilgrimage due in April this year . 
the Saudi Interior Ministry warned pilgrims in a statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency ( SPA ) against carrying any books , pictures or publications that have &quot; a political or propaganda aim &quot; . 
it said &quot; anybody found to be in possession of anything forbidden , no matter what its kind is , will be severely punished ... without any leniency or toleration &quot; . 
the ministry , which issues similar warnings before Haj every year , did not elaborate . 
up to two million Moslems perfom Haj at Mecca and Medina , two of Islam &apos;s holiest shrines , every year . 
Shi &apos;ite clerics ruling Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution say Moslems had a right to air their political grievances during the pilgrimage , mainly through rallies against Israel and the United States . 
Saudi &apos;s conservative Sunni rulers say the Haj , which draws Moslems from around the world , is a purely religious exercise . 
Saudi security forces clashed in 1987 with demonstrators in an Iranian-led rally in the streets of Mecca , killing about 400 people , mainly Iranians . 
Iran boycotted the Haj for the next three years . 
there has been no repeat of the bloodshed since the return of Iranian pilgrims in 1991 and their Haj rallies have been low-key affairs confined to the Iranian compounds .
