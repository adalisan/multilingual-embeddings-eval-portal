Massachusetts Representative Jim Marzilli , after meeting with Middlesex County legislators and officials , on Monday proposed to eliminate the county government and have the state assume all of its debt . 
the state &apos;s largest county , which runs from Cambridge to Lowell and is home to Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , defaulted on $ 4.7 million of revenue anticipation notes on Dec 13 . 
the fiscally challenged county ran into trouble by issuing debt on its hospital in Waltham and then agreeing to sell the money-losing facility for $ 4.5 million to Olympus Health Care . 
the hospital-related debt amounts to approximately $ 17 million . 
but that sale , which was slated to be consummated last week , ran into problems when the Waltham City Council declined to renew waivers for the medical facility to continue . 
the area is zoned for recreation . 
an aide to Marzilli said the Arlington Democrat plans on drafting legislation that would allow the Commonwealth to assume the county debt , county assets and county revenues streams in exchange for the county government ceasing to exist . 
Marzilli , in a letter to Middlesex County legislators , explained that &quot; The existing debt of Middlesex County will be paid by the state .... The assessments currently paid by the cities and towns to the county will be paid to the state until all debts incurred by the county are retired . 
under Marzilli &apos;s proposal , the positon of county treasurer , county commissioner and the county advisory board would be eliminated . 
county employees who transfer to state employment will bring their retirement contributions plus interest with them to the state system . 
any pension obligations generated by the current county workers would be blended with the county / state obligation . 
the unfunded liability for county workers will remain a county debt and would be treated like all county debts , funded through assessments on the cities and towns . 
unlike other states , most of the 14 counties in Massachusetts do not have the power to raise property taxes and provide little in the way of services to residents . 
the courts and prisons , which have been built with Massachusetts general obligation bonds , use state funds for much of their operating budgets . 
water and sanitation services are provided by other municipal agencies . 
the Massachusetts Legislature reconvenes on January 1 and Marzilli &apos;s aide Ellen Schneider said he hoped to introduce the legislation early in the session .
