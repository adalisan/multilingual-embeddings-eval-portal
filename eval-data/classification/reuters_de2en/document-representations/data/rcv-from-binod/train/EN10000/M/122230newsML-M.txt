growing demand from Russia and the Middle East countries has pushed up price of rice exports from India , which expects a good winter crop , traders and analysts said on Wednesday . 
&quot; firm demand from Russia and Middle East countries had pushed up Indian higher grades ( five percent broken ) rice export prices by nearly $ 10 , &quot; said Prem Garg , a leading Delhi foodgrains exporter . 
Garg said the export price of this quality rice had risen to $ 300 per tonne from $ 290 a week ago . 
traders said the price of Indian rice was on par with the price quoted for a similar variety in Vietnam , a leading rice exporter . 
&quot; But Russia has more than $ 10 dollars freight advantage if it buys from India than Vietnam , &quot; Garg said . 
he said the Middle East countries too had a freight advantage on purchases from India . 
analysts said rice imports by the Middle East countries increase at this time of the year due to seasonal factors . 
Garg did not say what quantities had been contracted with Russia or the Middle East countries . 
analysts said India &apos;s winter output was expected to be nearly 72 million tonnes , marginally up from last year &apos;s level of 71 million tonnes . 
the winter harvest began in early October . 
government officials had estimated India &apos;s winter rice production at a record 75 million tonnes . 
the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy ( CMIE ) , an independent think-tank , has estimated the winter rice output at 71.5 million tonnes . 
&quot; Less output is expected than the earlier anticipated due the marginal damage to the rice crop in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka , &quot; said one analyst . 
the southern state of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka contribute nearly 15 percent of the country &apos;s total rice output . 
India produced around 81 million tonnes of rice in 1995 / 96 ( June-July ) crop year . 
India &apos;s winter harvest starts in early October and continues till late in November . 
India annually produces two rice crops , getting the bulk of its output from the winter crop . 
traders said Indian five percent broken non-Basmati rice was currently quoted at $ 300 per tonne F.O.B , 10 percent broken at $ 280 , 15 percent at $ 255 and 25 percent at $ 240 . 
Garg said nearly 100,000 tonnes of rice from the new crop had started arriving daily in the markets . 
&quot; According to trade sources traders have signed deals to export nearly half a million tonnes of rice in November , &quot; an official in a leading Delhi foodgrains export firm told Reuters . 
India exported nearly 5.5 million tonnes of rice in 1995 / 96 ( April-March ) , against a target of three million . 
it emerged as the biggest exporter of rice after Thailand . 
industry officials feel India &apos;s rice exports in 1996 / 97 would dip to about three million tonnes due to a fall in international demand and uncompetitive prices .
