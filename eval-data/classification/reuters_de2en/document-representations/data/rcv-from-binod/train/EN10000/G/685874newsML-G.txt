the Prime Minister , John Howard , has raised the prospect of Asia-Pacific leaders tackling the issue of unemployment at their annual meetings . 
in his talks with U-S President Bill Clinton later this week , Mr Howard will be discussing strategies for the Asia-Pacific Cooperation Forum meeting to be held towards the end of the year . 
he suggests future meetings discuss common employment challenges and the flexibility of financial markets within APEC . 
&quot; All of these things are ones on which the member states of APEC have common experiences to pool , &quot; Mr Howard said . 
the Prime Minister , John Howard , has toughened his stance on uniform greenhouse gas emission targets even further , declaring there will be no compromise from Australia . 
Australia is refusing to support the targets despite pressure from Britain , with Mr Howard warning uniform targets would damage the economy and lead to cuts in wages . 
the rift on the issue between the two countries has widened , although they have agreed discussions will continue . 
the Prime Minister is expected to face similar pressure from the United States to accept some form of common target . 
Mr Howard says Australia &apos;s national interest will be damaged if it goes along with what the Europeans , in particular , are arguing for . 
&quot; I will just continue to put Australia &apos;s case and if at the end of the day we are not successful in obtaining accommodation , the arrangement will not be something that we we can be part of , &quot; he said . 
the Australian Aircraft Owners and pilots Association claims Air Services Australia changes could lead to serious accidents at airports throughout the country . 
important details about airstrips are being removed from documents which pilots are required to carry with them . 
rural and small airport owners throughout the country several years ago were given the option of de-licencing aerodromes to cut down on inspection costs . 
many took the opportunity . 
but now Air Services Australia is dropping important details in the Enroute Suppliment Australia pilot guide which shows runway lengths and the type of surface . 
aircraft Owners and pilots Association President , Boyd Munroe , says this seriously compromises safety . 
Mr Munroe says pilots are compelled to carry the document whenever they fly and now the most important piece of information about an airfield has been taken out of it . 
after more than a year of turmoil , Port Arthur is to make a fresh start to recovery . 
the bitterness in the Tasman community , suppressed since the massacre of 35 people in April last year , has surfaced in the report of the Tasmanian Government &apos;s Special Commisoner Max Doyle . 
much of the anger has been directed at the former board with allegations they were more concerned with limiting legal liability than the welfare of staff . 
the report details allegations of financial conflicts of interest , mismanagement and staff harassment . 
the board , most of whom have resigned already , will be replaced by four administrators . 
there will be a comprehensive review of what the site needs , security concerns will be addressed and there &apos;s to be a special debriefing to help those affected by the shootings . 
Mr Doyle also recommended a rehabilitation coordinator be appointed to help the recovery , and $ 250,000 be set aside for people in urgent need . 
as well , the Director of Public Prosecutions will investigate why a slide door at the Broad arrow Cafe , where 20 people were shot , could not be opened by people wanting to escape during the massacre . 
Mr Doyle was told seven people who had attempted to flee through the door were shot . 
Mr Doyle compared the massacre with the Vietnam War , with veterans after 30 years still affected by trauma . 
the chairman of a Joint Parliamentary Committee and Tasmania &apos;s Tourism Minister , Ray groom , has accepted the recommendations , saying the renewed discussion about the problems besetting Port Arthur should help the recovery . 
the Chief executive officer of the Port Arthur Authority , Craig Coombes , says trying to attach blame through an inquiry into the door problem is pointless . 
however Mr Doyle says he &apos;s merely responding to community demands . 
Optus has decided to postpone a plan to erect two Mobiletelephone bases in Sydney &apos;s north , until new sites are selected . 
residents have told the Council they &apos;re concerned about possible links between leukemia in children and low level radiaiton from the bases . 
local residents have opposed the planned sites in North Sydney and neutral Bay , since Optus first lodged its application with North Sydney Council . 
the residents claim the communications carrier has been unable to guarantee the low level radiation emissions from the bases , are not linked with leukemia in young children . 
North Sydney Mayor Genia McCaffery says the Council was particularly opposed to the North Sydney site because of it &apos;s proximity to schools and day care centres . 
she says to gain Council &apos;s approval , any future applications by Optus would need to be for more appropriate loations . 
Telstra says it accepts as a necessary requirement of deregulation , a 35 per cent cut to a key charge it levies on others in the telephone business . 
interconnection fees will fall when the market is deregulated from July the first , a move it is hoped will bring lower prices and improved service to users . 
the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has set the fees , which Telstra can charge other carriers and service providers , for six months . 
it originally wanted a 50 per cent cut , but came down to 35 after lobbying by Telstra . 
the ACCC says new industry players will still be better able to compete effectively under the new charging regime . 
service providers have been unavailable for comment . 
after six months , the charges will be determined by commercial negotiation , but a spokesman for Telstra says prices overall are likely to keep falling , with competition . 
the Commission will release other statements on pricing , competition , and guarantees of access to Telstra , in coming days . 
women &apos;s organisations are accusing the Federal Government of forcing women into leaving the workforce . 
presenting the fourth in the series of Whitlam lectures , feminist and social writer , Dr Anne Summers , said the Government &apos;s cuts to women &apos;s services and child care are making it too difficult for women to stay at work . 
she says the progress of women over the past 20 years is being eroded . 
Dr Summers says women could end up staying at home not because they want to , but because the wages they are getting in a deregulated wages system are lower , meaning work ceases to be financially worthwhile .
