Greek Jews said on Wednesday they would seek the extradition from Syria of Nazi war criminal Alois Brunner , blamed for the deaths of 120,000 European Jews . 
&quot; We will make an official request to the Greek Justice ministry this week , &quot; Nissim mais , president of the central board of the Jewish Community of Greece , told Reuters . 
&quot; This man was active in Salonika , where more than 50,000 Greek Jews were murdered . 
Brunner , the Austrian-born SS commander and right-hand man of Adolph Eichmann , is believed to be in Syria , a country which is on good terms with Greece , he said . 
&quot; Brunner is in Syria but we cannot ask for his extradition because Greece waived its rights on the prosecution of World War Two criminals , &quot; government spokesman Dimitris Reppas told reporters . 
he said that Greece transferred its extradition rights in 1959 to the then West Germany . 
&quot; Our legal experts are looking into whether this can be overcome and go directly to Syria , &quot; mais said . 
&quot; If not , then we want Greece to request Germany to act on its behalf . 
mais said the initiative was prompted by news reports that Brunner was alive and well and has been living in Damascus for the past 38 years . 
he would now be 84 years old . 
&quot; We know that he is so old that he might drop dead during his arrest . 
but it &apos;s not the man we care about , but his actions and his ideas , &quot; he said . 
thought to be the last of the senior Nazi criminals still alive , Brunner operated in the northern Greek city of Salonika , where almost the entire community of 60,000 Jews was sent to the gas chambers in 1943 . 
&quot; We know that he was methodical in his purpose , which was to eradicate Jews from the face of the earth . 
his victims were people of all ages and both sexes , &quot; said mais , whose community now has 5,000 members nationwide . 
Salonika &apos;s Jewish history dates back to the second century BC and St Paul preached at its synagogue . 
the city known at the turn of the century as the second Jerusalem now has a dwindling community of 1,000 Jews . 
a month after Brunner &apos;s arrival , cattle trains began taking Jews from Salonika to Auschwitz , deporting almost the entire Jewish population in a few months . 
Brunner also served as Commandant of the Drancy transit concentration camp on the outskirts of Paris . 
altogether he is blamed for the deaths of 120,000 Jews from Greece , the former Czechoslovakia , France and Austria .
