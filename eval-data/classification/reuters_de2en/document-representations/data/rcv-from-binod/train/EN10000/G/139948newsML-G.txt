autopsies of bodies from a mass grave of 200 people show they were shot execution-style after being removed from a Vukovar hospital by Serb forces , U.N. war-crimes investigators said on Thursday . 
the International Criminal Tribunal on former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) has indicted three former Yugoslav army officers for the killing of 261 Croat hospital patients seized in Vukovar after the town &apos;s fall to Serb forces in November 1991 . 
in a five-week exhumation completed on October 4 , ICTY experts retrieved 200 bodies from a mass grave in rural Ovcara , near Vukovar in eastern Croatia , where the patients were said by survivors and other witnesses to have been machine-gunned . 
Clint Williamson , ICTY legal adviser in the Ovcara inquiry , said autopsies on 90 bodies had been completed at a morgue in the Croatian capital Zagreb and about 30 of them had been tentatively identified . 
&quot; We believe that we are now in a position to say conclusively that the bodies recovered at Ovcara are those of men who were taken from Vukovar hospital on November 20 , 1991 , &quot; Williamson told a news conference . 
&quot; Provisional conclusions as to cause of death indicate that all of these persons died of multiple gunshot wounds consistent with an execution-style killing , rather than wounds that would have been incurred in battle . 
bodies were all male , from teenagers to men in their 60s , and none was found in military uniform . 
Williamson said that while many bodies had yet to be examined forensically , &quot; the conclusions we have reached now will in all likelihood not change &quot; . 
the whereabouts of 61 others listed as victims in the indictment remained unknown . 
but other mass tombs are believed to lie in Eastern Slavonia , a region still in Serb hands but soon to be returned to Croatia under U.N. supervision . 
Vukovar , on the Danube River border with Serbia , was demolished in a ferocious three-month siege by Yugoslav army regulars backing a local Serb minority revolt against Croatia &apos;s declaration of independence from federal Yugoslavia . 
the massacre at Ovcara was among the most notorious in the 1991-95 Yugoslav nationalist conflict . 
some bodies uncovered at Ovcara bore telltale signs , including orthopaedic casts , of having been medical patients . 
victims had been tentatively identified with the help of documents found on the remains , distinctive clothing , jewelry , tattoos and previously known injuries . 
Williamson said results of the inquiry so far appeared to bolster the indictment and could lead to new charges . 
the ICTY has censured rump Yugoslavia for refusing to extradite the three indicted Serbian officers , one of whom is believed to run an officers &apos; training school in Belgrade . 
ten days ago , Serbian media with close ties to the authorities confirmed for the first time that Serbs committed atrocities in Ovacara , but put the blame on paramilitary formations and carefully avoided accusing the army . 
analysts said this might possibly signal Belgrade &apos;s readiness to eventually hand over the war crimes suspects . 
media were banned from Ovcara during the exhumation to avoid inflaming emotions that might harm the peace process in Eastern Slavonia , which is to be gradually reintegrated with the rest of Croatia by mid-1997 .
