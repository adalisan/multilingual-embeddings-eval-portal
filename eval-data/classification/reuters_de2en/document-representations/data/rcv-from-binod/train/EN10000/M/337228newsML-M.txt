the Mauritian rupee weakened slightly against the dollar on Tuesday despite central bank intervention on Monday but strengthened against the pound , dealers said . 
the rupee was quoted at a mean commercial rate of 20.169 against the dollar from 20.084 on Monday . 
against the pound , the rupee traded at a mean of 32.558 on Tuesday from 32.727 on Monday . 
dealers said the central bank sold dollars in the interbank forex market on Monday at four cents lower than the prevailing interbank rate . 
but the intervention was not sufficient to prevent weakening the rupee because of dollar strength on international markets . 
&quot; Without the intervention , the rupee would have been fixed some 15 cents lower against the dollar today , &quot; a dealer said .
