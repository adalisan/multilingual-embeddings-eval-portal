the conflict in Zaire was spreading as rebels who now say they want to bring down the government seized more territory and claimed to have entered the eastern region &apos;s biggest town . 
the embattled government denied that the rebels had taken parts of Kisangani , the site of a major air base , but admitted the loss of two other towns in weekend battles near the border with Uganda . 
fighting has been intensifying since more than half the Rwandan refugees who had fled to Zaire returned to their own country two weeks ago , going a long way to removing the original cause of the Zaire fighting . 
the Rwandan-backed ethnic Tutsi rebels , originally immigrants from Rwanda , took up arms in October to fight for citizenship rights in Zaire and have seized a strip of territory in eastern Zaire . 
but the crisis now appears to have entered a new phase , with rebel leaders saying their objective is to overthrow the Kinshasa government led by ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko , who has held power for 31 years . 
an all-out rebel assault on Zaire &apos;s central government could further complicate plans for multinational military intervention to help refugees still trapped in Zaire . 
the rebels said on Monday they had captured towns at the northern and southern ends of a front 400 km ( 250 miles ) long and had penetrated parts of the regional capital Kisangani . 
the government firmly denied rebels had taken Kisangani , which lies 500 km ( 300 miles ) northwest of Goma . 
&quot; They are dreaming , &quot; government spokesman Boguo Makeli said in Kinshasa , the central African country &apos;s capital . 
commander John Kabunga , senior aide to rebel leader Laurent Kabila , told Reuters in the town of Goma in eastern Zaire that rebel forces had reached Kisangani from the east by bypassing a town where they had encountered difficulties . 
&quot; Parts of our forces are now in control of parts of Kisangani . 
we went there by bypassing the town of Walikale , which is still giving us problems , &quot; Kabunga said . 
aid workers who flew from Kisangani at about midday on Monday said in Kinshasa there had been no sign of the rebels and they would be surprised if guerrillas had entered Kisangani unnoticed . 
but they said Kisangani was extremely tense . 
they said a military plane had brought in the bodies of soldiers killed in Beni , raising tension among soldiers in Kisangani . 
missionaries said earlier that the rebels routed the Zairean army at the northern town of Beni on Saturday and were advancing towards the larger town of Bunia . 
according to the rebel , Zairean troops fled through eastern Zaire in apparent disarray , looting and raping as they went . 
they have failed to mount a coherent counter-offensive since the rebels defeated them around the eastern border towns of Goma and Bukova in October . 
the campaign has displaced hundreds of thousands , many of them refugees from neighbouring Rwanda . 
Laurent Kabila , leader of the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for Liberation of Congo-Zaire , told reporters on Monday another conquest by his forces was Kamituga , a gold and diamond mining centre 90 km ( 55 miles ) southwest of Bukavu . 
in Paris , Belgian Defence Minister Jean-Pol Poncelet slammed what he called the world &apos;s chronic indecisiveness in dealing with the crisis created by the presence of refugees in Zaire . 
&quot; The chronic indecisiveness of the international community on how to intervene in the region of the African Great Lakes has unfortunately not given the West European Union a chance to show it was ready to act and that is regrettable , &quot; he said .
