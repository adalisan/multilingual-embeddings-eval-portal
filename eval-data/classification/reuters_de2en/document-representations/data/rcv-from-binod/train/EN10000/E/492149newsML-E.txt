new harmonised inflation measures , which will be used in assessing which countries qualify for Europe &apos;s single currency , showed EU inflation slipping to 2.0 percent in Feburary , the EU said on Monday . 
Eurostat , the EU &apos;s statistical office , said inflation in February advanced at an annual rate of 2.0 percent in February , down from a 2.2 percent rise in the prior month . 
ten countries within the 15-nation bloc posted inflation figures under two percent , the office added . 
within the EU inflation was least noticeable in Finland , where prices rose by a scant 0.6 percent . 
Greece , meanwhile , posted the strongest inflation gain at an annual rate of 6.5 percent in February . 
the new system of measuring inflation was introduced in January and will be used by the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute in their 1998 convergence reports on monetary union . 
the figures are not intended to replace national consumer price indices which are often used to calculate changes in cost of living allowances and other government programmes .
