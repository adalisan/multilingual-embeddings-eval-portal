CBOT soy product futures closed lower on Tuesday , pressured by commercial selling and by reports China has resold South American soyoil , traders said . 
U.S exporters said China has resold between 25,000 to 50,000 tonnes of Argentine soyoil to two trading houses in recent days . 
January soyoil futures struggled with the report all session and closed down 0.10 cent per lb at 24.55 cents . 
other months were 0.01 to 0.04 cent per lb lower . 
commercial selling in both soyoil and soymeal kept both markets on the minus side despite gains in soybeans . 
traders attributed the action to soybean crushers buying the raw materials and selling the finished products . 
ADM reportedly sold 700 lots soyoil while Cargill Inc sold 600 lots on the day . 
Cargill was also a major seller of soymeal . 
traders said Continental grain , Produce grain and ADM were also sellers of soymeal . 
reports of rain in key South American growing regions eased supply concerns but Brazilian sources said the rains missed the south where most of the crop is grown . 
soymeal closed $ 1.00 to $ 1.60 lower with January down $ 1.40 at $ 237.30 a ton . 
Soyoil volume was estimated at 25,000 lots , against Monday &apos;s actual volume of 42,013 lots . 
soymeal volume was estimated at 22,000 lots , compared with Monday &apos;s tally of 29,384 lots .
