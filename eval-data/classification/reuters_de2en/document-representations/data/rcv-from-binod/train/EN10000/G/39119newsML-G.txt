Secretary of State Warren Christopher said on Saturday the United States understood Turkey &apos;s reasons for establishing a security zone in Iraq and had been reassured it would be temporary . 
he told reporters travelling with him a five-day trip to Europe that the Turks had &quot; genuine reasons to be concerned about their border and ( cross-border attacks by ) the PKK &quot; . 
PKK ( Kurdistan Workers &apos; Party ) guerrillas have long sought to carve an independent state out of southeastern Turkey and operate from bases in northern Iraq . 
following U.S. air attacks last week in retaliation against Baghdad for sending troops into Kurdish-controlled areas of northern Iraq , Ankara said it planned to set up a buffer zone against attacks from the PKK . 
&quot; We understand their reasons for doing so and we &apos;ve been reassured the situation will only be temporary and their forces will not be stationed there , &quot; Christopher said . 
Turkish troops have been massing along the Iraqi border in apparent readiness to push against the PKK . 
but army officials would not confirm or deny Turkish press reports that troops had already mounted some cross-border attacks . 
France has opposed the Turkish security zone plan and Russia has said it would destabilise the region further . 
Christopher said Turkey -- a NATO ally -- had long taken the same position as the United States in supporting Iraq &apos;s territorial integrity . 
he also stressed the &quot; important role &quot; Turkey had played in the region and in supporting and participating in the U.S.-led Gulf War coalition against Iraq . 
Turkey has also asked the United States for compensation for economic losses resulting from the air strikes . 
the military action was meant to punish Iraq for sending thousands of troops into northern Iraq in support of one of two Kurdish factions -- separate from the PKK -- which are fighting for dominance in the zone patrolled by the United States and its allies . 
asked about compensation , Christopher only repeated that Washington would consult Ankara on the subject . 
later , Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller announced her country was also seeking Western protection for ethnic Turks in northern Iraq . 
U.S. officials said they were unaware of the request or what she meant by it . 
in the interview , Christopher acknowledged disappointment that Russia refused to back the U.S. strikes against Iraq . 
&quot; Frankly , I was disappointed in the Russian reaction , not in their evaluation of Saddam &apos;s conduct -- because I think they regard it as being reckless and dangerous , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I was disappointed they didn &apos;t understand the necessity of taking forceful action . 
I think they don &apos;t understand as we do that the only language that Saddam understands is the language of force , &quot; he said . 
Christopher also acknowledged that he would have preferred if France joined the United States in patrolling the expanded no-fly zone over southern Iraq , instead of sticking to the previous , slightly narrower zone . 
but &quot; in an overall sense I don &apos;t feel let down &quot; , he said referring to talks on Thursday in Paris because France had been cooperative on NATO and Bosnia . 
Christopher arrived in London on Saturday from Stuttgart and was to meet Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy on Sunday before returning to Washington .
