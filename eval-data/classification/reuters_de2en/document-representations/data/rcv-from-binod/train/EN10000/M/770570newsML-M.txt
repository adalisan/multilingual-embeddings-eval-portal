Istanbul &apos;s stock exchange index soared 2.63 percent on Thursday in selective trade , led by flat steel producer Eregli Demir Celik , brokers said . 
trade volume jumped 35.2 percent to 32.9 trillion lira from Wednesday &apos;s 24.4 trillion . 
brokers say demand for Eregli has also boosted the index . 
&quot; An amazing buying activity was observed in Eregli , &quot; said Serdar Karatepe from Polen Securities . 
&quot; Eregli was up with strong demand . 
an administrative court had cancelled a tender for the privatisation of Eregli on Tuesday . 
&quot; Investors think that the next tender to be opened would be the final one because the new government is very keen on privatisation , &quot; Karatepe said . 
the company is still on the government &apos;s privatisation programme . 
Eregli had made up 26.7 percent of total daily trade volume . 
its price rose by 13.8 percent to 26,750 on Thursday and 24.4 percent in the past two days . 
&quot; brokers were cautious because there was not much activity in the market , except state shares which have a significant effect on the index because of their high market capitalisations , &quot; Cagatay Ozdemir from Garanti Securities said . 
&quot; The sentiment might turn to negative if demand for them finishes , &quot; Ozdemir said . 
some brokers said Eregli shares had attracted foreign investors . 
but no immediate confirmation is available . 
of the 251 shares traded , gainers outdid losers sharply by 124 to 66 and 61 were stable . 
the highest rise was seen in the index representing the metals sector with a sharp 9.52 percent gain . 
leading active share of the session was largely state owned flat steel producer Eregli up 3,250 to 26,750 , followed by oil refiner Tupras unchanged at 16,000 and state owned petroleum distributor Petrol Ofisi , unchanged at 31,000 . 
the three made up 34.4 percent of the total volume .
