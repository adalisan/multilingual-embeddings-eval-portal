Honduras &apos; chief prosecutor Thursday called his country a &quot; paradise &quot; for corrupt officials . 
Edmundo Orellana , who is seeking the prosecution of former President Rafael Callejas on corruption charges , said the Honduran controller &apos;s office , responsible for policing illegal enrichment , has not functioned for decades . 
&quot; Honduras is corruption , &quot; Orellana told a seminar on the topic . 
&quot; We should admit that our country is a paradise for the cunning . 
he said crooked officials had dipped into grants and loans intended to be used for health , education and infrastructure projects . 
in addition , graft has been rampant in the awarding of government contracts , he said . 
&quot; In Honduras , we see people get rich quick and nobody can explain where they got this fortune and nor does anyone investigate because we have lived in an environment of accepting corruption , &quot; Orellana said . 
Orellana is asking the Honduran Congress to lift the immunity that Callejas has been granted as former president so that he can bring charges of abuse of power and misappropriation of funds . 
Callejas has denied any wrongdoing and said Orellana has an &quot; obsession &quot; with bringing him to trial .
