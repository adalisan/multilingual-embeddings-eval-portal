the Dow Jones industrial average revisited the 6,000-point milestone Monday , as the blue-chip market extended its rally amid signs that the economy is growing at a moderate pace and inflation is in check . 
at 1 p.m. EDT , the Dow was up 43.23 points at 6,012.61 after jumping 48 points on Friday . 
the index was back at 6,000 points for the first time since last Tuesday , when it soared but closed short of the mark . 
in the broader market , advancing issues led declines 11-9 on subdued volume of 186 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
the Nasdaq composite index rose was up 5.78 points at 1,254.05 . 
stocks were boosted by Friday &apos;s news that the Producer Price Index rose only 0.2 percent in September in a sign that inflation remained tame at the wholesale level . 
on Wednesday , the government will report the Consumer Price Index for September . 
CPI on average is expected to rise 0.3 percent after a 0.1-percent gain in August . 
many investors stayed away as the bond market was closed due to the Columbus Day holiday . 
&quot; In a thin market it is not hard to move prices higher or lower , &quot; said Larry Wachtel , an analyst at prudential Securities . 
&quot; This is the fourth time we have gotten over 6,000 on the Dow , and I suspect that before the day is over we will find ourselves below . 
the 6,000 level becomes less and less dramatic every time we cross it . 
the day was dominated by earnings and expectations of earnings , with Intel Corp. rallying 3 / 4 to 106-1 / 8 on expectations of a strong earnings report after the closing bell . 
caterpillar Inc . , the world &apos;s largest construction and mining equipment maker , rose 1 to 74-1 / 4 after analysts said they expected the firm &apos;s third quarter earnings per share will rise by 30 percent . 
oil stocks also put in a strong showing , a mixed blessing at best . 
Texaco Inc. led energy stocks higher as oil prices surged on renewed fighting in Iraqi Kurdistan . 
Texaco was up 3-1 / 8 at 101-1 / 4 . 
crude oil gained 78 cents at $ 25.44 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange . 
Exxon Corp. was up 1-1 / 4 at 87-5 / 8 , Chevron Corp. rose 3 / 4 at 66-1 / 2 and Mobil Corp. was up 1-3 / 4 at 118-7 / 8 . 
such strength in the oil sector is a double edged sword , said Michael Metz , chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co . 
&quot; It &apos;s not bullish for the overall market , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It could signal commodity inflation , an involuntary tax on the consumer and increased corporate expenses .
