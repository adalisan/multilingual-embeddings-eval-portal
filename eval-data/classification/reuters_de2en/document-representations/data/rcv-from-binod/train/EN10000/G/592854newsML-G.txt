Zaire &apos;s army chief was killed by units of President Mobutu Sese Seko &apos;s elite guard late on Friday night , a diplomatic source in Kinshasa said on Saturday . 
general Mahele Lieko Bokungu , defence minister and chief of army staff , was killed at Camp Tshatshi in the Zairean capital , the barracks residence of the ailing president . 
&quot; Mahele was killed at the camp by the Special Presidential Division ( DSP ) , &quot; a senior Western diplomat told Reuters in neighbouring Congo by telephone . 
the circumstances of Mahele &apos;s death were unclear but some sources said he went to the camp with units of Zaire &apos;s regular army to bring DSP elements under control . 
Mobutu left Kinshasa on Friday and flew to his northern base in Gbadolite as Laurent Kabila &apos;s rebels closed in on the capital . 
his government said the 66-year-old president had relinquished executive powers . 
shortly after Mahele &apos;s killing , armoured cars took up position around Kinshasa &apos;s intercontinental Hotel where prominent members of Mobutu &apos;s 32-year administration were staying . 
since his appointment last December , the general had never been in full control of the DSP , a largely tribal presidential guard which at its height numbered 10,000 . 
military forces from five Western nations , the United States , Belgium , Britain , France and Portugal , are in Congo ready to evacuate foreigners from Kinshasa if violence erupts . 
several hours after Mahele &apos;s killing , there was no sign that the evacuation was about to begin . 
the United States on Friday welcomed Mobutu &apos;s departure from power in the shattered , corruption-plagued nation but said Kabila now had to prove his democratic credentials . 
&quot; The day of the dictator should be over in Zaire and we hope that a different day has arrived , &quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told U.S.-based television network CNN . 
earlier , Zaire Information Minister Kin-Kiey Mulumba said Mobutu , fighting prostate cancer and seven months of civil war , quit Kinshasa on Friday for his northern jungle palace at Gbadolite and had left his emergency-rule government in charge . 
news of Mobutu &apos;s departure triggered speculation that he was on his way to exile . 
diplomats said later that Morocco or France were likely destinations . 
Mobutu , characteristically defiant , did not formally resign as head of state , as demanded by Kabila and reportedly proposed by a peace plan formulated by South African President Nelson Mandela . 
Kin-Kiey said Archbishop Laurent Monsengwo , a key player early in Zaire &apos;s democratic transition , would negotiate with the rebels on a new transitional government and elections . 
but the rebels rejected the government announcement out of hand and told Mobutu &apos;s army not to fight or loot . 
asked if their forces planned to advance on the usually teeming city of five million people , Kabila &apos;s foreign affairs spokesman Bizima Karaha said : &quot; We believe that the people in Kinshasa deserve to be liberated and need to be liberated more than ever before . 
Kinshasa spent its fourth successive night under curfew . 
many residents welcomed the news that Mobutu had gone but were anxious about what would come next as rebel forces closed in on a capital bereft of clear leadership . 
reports of shooting at Kinshasa &apos;s international airport 25 km ( 16 miles ) east of the city late on Friday could not be independently confirmed . 
Kinshasa has lived in fear that a rebel advance might trigger not a battle , but an orgy of looting by fleeing troops . 
Western military sources said on Friday the rebels were very close to the airport and only 80 km ( 50 miles ) east of the city . 
Mobutu , 66 , who is reputed to have amassed a huge personal fortune over the years , seized power in 1965 . 
Western powers supported him as a Cold War bastion against Soviet communism . 
Kabila , 56 , and his rebels took up arms in October in a dispute over Zairean nationality for ethnic Tutsis . 
they now control most of what is potentially one of Africa &apos;s richest nations , with a wealth of minerals and fertile farm land .
