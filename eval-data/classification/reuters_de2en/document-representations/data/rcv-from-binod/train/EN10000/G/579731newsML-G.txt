Italy on Tuesday questioned the European Union &apos;s prospects for enlargement unless its 15 members were able to agree on deep reforms to the way the bloc works at a crucial summit in the Netherlands next month . 
Prime Minister Romano Prodi , speaking at a news conference with Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok , said the EU &apos;s workings could be paralysed by the entry of up to a dozen new members unless the reform process was successful . 
&quot; We want strong reform ... and we are in great need of strong institutions because we can &apos;t afford to have the enlargement if we don &apos;t have a deep reform of the European institutions , &quot; Prodi said . 
&quot; Italy is in favour of enlargement but we don &apos;t want this to be made in such a way as to paralyse the workings of the European Union , &quot; he said . 
since March last year an EU inter-governmental conference ( IGC ) has been considering how best to change decision-making methods and forge policy in areas such as foreign , security and internal affairs . 
the process aims to produce a more efficient and transparent Union , paving the way for an ambitious eastward expansion that could see up to a dozen ex-communist states joining in the next decade . 
but , just five weeks before EU leaders are due to sign the treaty reforms at a June 16-17 summit in Amsterdam , negotiations are bogged down over the nuts and bolts of institutional change -- the size of a future European Commission and how to ensure the decision-making process fairly represents each country &apos;s population . 
Kok , whose country holds the EU &apos;s rotating presidency , has called an informal summit in the Dutch coastal town of Noordwijk on May 23 in a bid to keep the negotiations on track . 
Kok , visiting Rome after similar consultations in Portugal and Spain , said he was hopeful that the Noordwijk talks would help make the Amsterdam summit a substantial success . 
but he too appeared to question the sense of enlargement without a more streamlined European Union . 
&quot; At the moment when we conclude these negotiations we must ... check if the Union from that moment on , also as far as the institutions are concerned , is ready for enlargement , &quot; Kok said . 
Prodi noted that the EU has told aspiring members , including Poland , the Czech Republic and Hungary , that membership talks cannot start until six months after the end of the IGC review . 
asked whether Italy would block enlargement if it were dissatisfied with the Amsterdam outcome , Prodi said Rome was focusing on the reform process , not what comes beyond it . 
he also denied , in response to a question , that Italy might consider wrecking the summit to signal displeasure at mounting indications that its partners do not consider it ready to join Europe &apos;s planned single currency . 
&quot; When you are concentrated on progress you don &apos;t even think about vetoes , &quot; Prodi said .
