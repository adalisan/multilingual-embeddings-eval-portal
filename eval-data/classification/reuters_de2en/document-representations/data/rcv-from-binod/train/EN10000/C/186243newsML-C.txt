Egypt , Turkey and the U.S. oil company Amoco signed an agreement on Wednesday for Egypt to export to Turkey up to 10 billion ( corrects from million ) cubic metres of liquefied natural gas a year by the year 2000 . 
the deal , signed at the Middle East economic conference , is a direct snub to Israel and to the concept of regional cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbours . 
the memorandum of understanding , signed by Amoco and state companies Botas of Turkey and Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation ( EGPC ) , is for a project that will cost between $ 2 billion and $ 4 billion . 
the quantities will meet just over one third of Turkey &apos;s natural gas requirements in the year 2000 . 
oil companies had previously proposed a &quot; peace pipeline &quot; running from northeastern Egypt to Turkey by land through the Gaza Strip , Israel , Lebanon and Syria . 
but Amoco , flush with gas from its recent discoveries in the Nile Delta and apparently frustrated with slow progress in Middle East peace talks , decided that direct LNG exports by tanker to Turkey would be the quickest feasible solution . 
another factor is that Israel has no internal gas distribution network and could take only two billion cubic metres a year for some years to come , officials said . 
the deal also upstaged the Italian energy group Eni , which still prefers a pipeline , if necessary avoiding Israel by running along the bed of the Mediterranean from Port Said in Egypt to Iskanderun in southeast Turkey . 
AGIP SpA , a subsidiary of Eni , has been working closely with Amoco in the Nile Delta gas fields , which the U.S. company this year started to describe as a world-class gas basin . 
&quot; In some cases , to move quickly , one partner will make a decision and then involve the other partner in discussions at a later point , &quot; Richard Flury , vice president of Amoco U.S. , told a news conference on the deal . 
the Egyptian government said earlier on Wednesday that it had invited Eni to take part in the LNG export project and an Oil Ministry statement said ENI had accepted the offer . 
but Eni Chairman Guglielmo Moscato was more cautious about the deal when Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdi el-Banbi announced it at the new conference . 
&quot; Of course I understand why they pushed ahead with an agreement with ( the Turkish state company ) Botas because this may be something that can go ahead faster than other solutions . 
&quot; We shall be considering this one . 
of course , we have to verify that it is the most economical alternative and the most feasible for the countries , Egypt and Turkey , &quot; Moscato said . 
Amoco Corp President William Lowrie said at the signing ceremony that Amoco and EGPC personnel would check the north Egyptian coast from Sinai to west of Alexandria from next week in search of a site for the liquefaction plant . 
Moscato said he remained convinced that the &quot; peace pipeline &quot; would still be the most economical way to move Egyptian natural gas to Israel and on to Turkey . 
Flury said Amoco was not ruling out a pipeline at a later stage and a Botas official said Turkey , greedy for natural gas imports , would also welcome all sources of supply . 
Turkey and Iran have signed a controversial gas pipeline deal but the Botas official said this would not provide enough gas because Iran has to reinject so much gas into its oil fields . 
that pipeline will carry three billion cubic metres a year from 1998 , rising to 10 billion from 2005 . 
Moscato told the conference of ambitious projects for bringing gas from Qatar , Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia to the northeast Egyptian town of El Arish for export to Europe .
