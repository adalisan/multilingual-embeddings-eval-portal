President Sali Berisha , backed by Albania &apos;s opposition parties , agreed on Thursday to suspend military activity against rebels in the south and to offer an amnesty to insurgents who surrendered weapons within two days . 
the offer was made public in a statement after more than five hours of talks . 
the statement said participants in the talks asked the Council of Defence , overseeing emergency measures introduced last weekend , &quot; to order the suspension of offensive military operations in the zones where they had been planned , for 48 hours starting at 6 a.m. ( 0500 GMT ) on Friday &quot; . 
rebels were to start handing in their arms at the same time and would be granted an amnesty if they had committed no crimes , the statement said . 
Berisha was to start seeking a consensus on a replacement for Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi , who stepped down last week . 
more than 25 people have died in southern Albania in the latest wave of more than a month of violence and rebels control several towns in the region . 
opposition parties , led by the successors to the Communist Party , have demanded creation of a coalition government of technocrats . 
international efforts to find a political solution to the crisis have intensified . 
a Council of Europe delegation was in Tirana on Thursday and Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo , representing the European Union , was due to arrive on Friday after talks in Rome and Athens .
