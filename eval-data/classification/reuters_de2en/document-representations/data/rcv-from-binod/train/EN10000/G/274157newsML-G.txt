Japanese Ambassador Morihisa Aoki , host of an ill-fated reception at his Lima home that turned into a hostage nightmare , was not among 13 Japanese nationals freed on Sunday by rebel captors , a Foreign Ministry spokesman said . 
&quot; We know that he was not among the released hostages , &quot; the spokesman told reporters . 
at least five ambassadors and four U.S. diplomats were included among 225 hostages released on Sunday night by Marxist rebels holding the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence in Lima , Red Cross officials have said . 
chief Red Cross mediator Michel Minnig said 225 hostages had been released from the embassy residence and that more than 140 were still held inside . 
the officials said at least two diplomats were among 13 Japanese released , but they had no details of the others &apos; occupations . 
in a message read before the release began , the guerrillas insisted on their demands for the release of fellow Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) comrades from jail before letting other hostages go . 
the MRTA guerrillas warned the government in their statement that they would not release Peruvian officials and Japanese businessmen held in the residence unless Fujimori agreed to set free more than 400 jailed MRTA members -- something the government has rejected . 
the crisis , in its sixth day , began last Tuesday night when the guerrillas stormed an exclusive cocktail party at the ambassador &apos;s residence .
