as leaders of the Caribbean prepare for their first-ever summit May 10 with U.S. President Bill Clinton , communist-ruled Cuba is the ghost at the feast . 
Washington and the Caribbean &apos;s leaders are poles apart on how to deal with absent Cuba , the sole communist regime in the hemisphere , and neither side is happy with the other &apos;s approach . 
Caribbean leaders prefer a form of &quot; constructive engagement &quot; similar to U.S. diplomacy toward the apartheid regime in South Africa to coax and encourage change in Cuba . 
the United States , on the other hand , recently tightened its 35-year-old embargo against Cuba , passing a controversial law seeking to extend its effects to companies in third countries that trade with and invest in Cuba . 
to regional leaders , the law , known as Helms-Burton , is another example of unilateral U.S. action that rankles . 
leaders of the 14-member Caribbean Community ( Caricom ) , Haiti and the Dominican Republic plan to raise several such issues with Clinton on Saturday . 
these include the Federal Communications Commission &apos;s decision to lower the accounting rates for international phone calls , which is likely to cost the Caribbean hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue if implemented . 
there is also the Federal Aviation Administration &apos;s new categorization of civil aviation departments , which has cost the two main regional air carriers some $ 150 million in losses over the past two years as they attempt to compete with U.S.-based American Airlines . 
the Caribbean fears the U.S. embargo will only lead to political instability in Cuba , which in turn would have a chilling ripple effect on potential investment for the entire region . 
foreign investment is vitally needed to replace aid flows that have dried up in the past decade . 
former Commonwealth secretary-general and current Caricom chief trade negotiator Sir Shridath Ramphal said the United States needs to move &quot; out of their Cold War posture ( of ) being a strong-arm power &quot; and begin &quot; giving more enlightened leadership &quot; on issues like Cuba . 
Ramphal headed the West Indian Commission , set up by Caricom six years ago to chart a course for the region &apos;s future , which recommended the region strengthen its ties with Cuba and invite Havana to join the 35-member Association of Caribbean States . 
earlier this month , a Jamaican firm become the first foreign company to set up shop in Cuba &apos;s first free zone . 
air Jamaica will begin direct flights to Havana on June 1 , and the European Union-funded Caribbean Export Development Agency has opened an office in Cuba . 
perhaps the most telling gesture occurred last month , when Grenada &apos;s Prime Minister Keith Mitchell was in Cuba on an official visit , 14 years after U.S. troops ousted a Cuban- backed Marxist regime in Grenada . 
Mitchell invited Cuban President Fidel Castro to attend next year &apos;s Caricom summit -- which will likely be held in Grenada . 
CARICOM will meet in Jamaica this July to consider whether to begin negotiating a free trade accord with Cuba . 
however , the region is proceeding more cautiously than most officials care to admit publicly , out of concern for Washington &apos;s reaction , regional sources say . 
&quot; The reality is the politicians don &apos;t want to jeopardise their relations with the U.S. , &quot; admitted one regional trade official . 
&quot; Save Trinidad , Barbados , and the Dominican Republic , none of these countries has the capacity to export to Cuba at levels that would justify the political risk . 
when asked if the May 10 summit would broach the issue of Cuba , the response of Jamaican Prime Minister and summit chairman P.J. 
Patterson was a terse &quot; no . 
but officials say the matter of raising it with Clinton was discussed in Thursday &apos;s preparatory talks among the region &apos;s heads of governments . 
the final decision was not to bring it up , for fear it would bog down the rest of the meeting . 
&quot; I think we &apos;ll make our position ( on relations with Cuba ) clear , &quot; noted Caricom Secretary-General Edwin Carrington , &quot; but we &apos;re not going to fight that battle at this summit .
