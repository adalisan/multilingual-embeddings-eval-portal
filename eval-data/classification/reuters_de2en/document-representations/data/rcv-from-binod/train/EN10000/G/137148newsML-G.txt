the wording looks so innocent and the objective worthy . 
but a proposed amendment to the Colorado state constitution about the rights of parents to have a greater say in bringing up their children has become one of the most controversial measures on the Nov . 5 ballot . 
besides voting for president and other offices on Election Day , Colorado voters will decide on a host of other issues including the amendment on parents rights . 
supporters say the amendment will strengthen the family , but opponents claim it will give parents a free hand to abuse their children without fear of legal retribution . 
Colorado voters are being asked to accept or reject an initiative that would recognise the right of parents to &quot; direct and control the upbringing , education , values and discipline of their children . 
&quot; It &apos;s just common sense that parents should be at the centre of decision-making , &quot; said Jeffrey Bell , president of the Arlington , Virginia-based advocacy group &quot; Of the People &quot; that has sent more than $ 100,000 to the Rocky Mountain state in support of the proposal . 
proponents say it would affirm the individual , natural and inalienable rights of parents in raising their children . 
if approved , parents could use the amendment to assert their right to control the education of their own children . 
for instance , parents unhappy with the public school near home could use the amendment to bolster their argument to put their child in a neighbouring district , Bell said . 
he said he did not believe this would lead to chaos in public schools . 
other possibilities include allowing parents to keep their children out of sex-education classes or programmes that distribute condoms . 
efforts to get the proposal into state constitutions via legislatures have failed in 28 states . 
the Colorado effort is the first time the proposal goes directly to the voters . 
physicians , teachers , prosecutors , educators , local politicians and even former Miss America and Colorado resident Marilyn Van Derbur Atler have called on voters to reject the parental rights amendment . 
bell argues the groups opposing the measure represent the establishment . 
&quot; It &apos;s one of those issues where populism and elitism are opposed . 
he may have a point . 
polls show voters approving the measure by a margin of two to one . 
if approved in Colorado the measure could be expected to spread to other states , making victory here paramount . 
but opponents argue the wording is deceptively simple and could end up being a virtual license to abuse children as well as putting every child protection law in jeopardy . 
&quot; There are people who are very good at putting ballot titles that makes it -- on the face -- very difficult to oppose , &quot; Denver Mayor Wellington Webb told Reuters . 
&quot; Who could be against parents &apos; rights ? 
Webb said he fears it may become more difficult and consequently more expensive for social workers to intervene in cases where children have been abused by their parents . 
bell disagrees . 
&quot; Parental rights are not absolute , &quot; he said , adding that he would oppose any parent who tried to use the amendment as a defence in a child abuse case .
