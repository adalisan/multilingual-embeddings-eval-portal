the International Monetary Fund plans to send a mission to Pakistan in early July once it has digested the budget for fiscal 1997 / 98 ( July-June ) , an IMF official said on Saturday . 
&quot; We are looking at the budget , we are compiling the numbers and we expect a mission to come in early July to continue discussions with the Pakistani government , &quot; IMF resident representative Shamsuddin Tariq told Reuters . 
the IMF halted a standby loan to Pakistan in March after it became clear that agreed targets for 1996 / 97 could not be met . 
it agreed to keep up a policy dialogue with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif &apos;s new government and continue to monitor Pakistan &apos;s economic performance in the six months to September . 
the Fund wanted to see containment of the 1996 / 97 budget deficit , setting a revised target of 6.2 percent of gross domestic product , and further fiscal consolidation in 1997 / 98 , with a deficit target of five percent of GDP . 
these targets formed part of Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz &apos;s budget presentation to parliament on Friday . 
&quot; Full and timely implementation of the staff monitoring programme would form the basis for a resumption of Fund financial support to Pakistan in the context of multi-year arrangements under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility ( ESAF ) and the Extended Fund Facility , &quot; the IMF said in April . 
if the IMF finds the budget figures acceptable , it could offer Pakistan a new ESAF later this year , but it is not yet clear whether this would start before or after September .
