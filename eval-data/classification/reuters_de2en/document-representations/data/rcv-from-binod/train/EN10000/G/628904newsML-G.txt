Canadian Greg Moore won a gamble on fuel economy and held off hard-charging Michael Andretti to become the youngest driver ever to win a CART series event by taking the Milwaukee 200 IndyCar race on Sunday . 
Moore , driving a Reynard Mercedes-Benz had a .348 of a second margin over Andretti , a five-time winner at the one-mile oval , in a Swift Ford . 
third place went to American Jimmy Vasser in a Reynard Honda , 10.66 seconds behind . 
&quot; It &apos;s about time we &apos;ve got one , &quot; said the 22-year-old Moore , who averaged 119.597 miles per hour ( 192.47 kph ) for the 200-lap event . 
the relief of getting his first win was evident for Moore , who finished second at Surfers Paradise Australia . 
&quot; It does take a lot of pressure off , &quot; said Moore . 
but it just wasn &apos;t enough . 
with his second-place finish , Andretti moved into second place in the series standings behind Canadian Paul Tracy ( 94 points to 70 ) , who finished sixth . 
Moore took the lead on lap 135 and stayed on the track , gambling he had enough fuel to last him . 
he won the gamble and led the last 66 laps after polesitter Tracy dove into the pits for fuel and tires . 
a dejected Tracy said &quot; we decided on our pit strategy but it didn &apos;t work out for us today . 
&quot; Tracy had won the last three races thanks in large measure to successful pit-stop strategy . 
although Tracy was able to hold his lead early in the race his Penske Mercedes-Benz didn &apos;t run as well in traffic as Moore &apos;s . 
twice Moore caught Tracy only to turn over the lead coming out of the pits . 
there were four cautions due to crashes but none of the drivers were injured . 
the series resumes next week in Detroit for the eighth event in the 17-race series . 
in an Indy Lights event run at the track , Clint Mears , son of four-time Indy 500 winner Rick Mears , won his first professional race , driving a Lola Buick .
