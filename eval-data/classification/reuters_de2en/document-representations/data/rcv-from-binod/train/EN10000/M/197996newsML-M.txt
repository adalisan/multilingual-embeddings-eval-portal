the industrial metals market will keep a close eye on copper inventories this week following wide price movements and speculation last week about a hidden stockpile . 
the market will also closely monitor London Metal Exchange ( LME ) stock data on Tuesday and Friday to see if the recent pace of drawdowns is maintained . 
last week LME flagship copper started the week calmly , handcuffed to a tight range , only to rally to a 2-1 / 2 month high of $ 2,152 following a fall in LME stocks by 8,000 tonnes on Friday . 
stocks fell by 12,225 tonnes over the week , making a drop of over 50 percent in the past two months . 
currently they stand at 6-1 / 4 year lows of 101,175 tonnes and are expected to dip below the all-important psychological level of 100,000 tonnes this week . 
despite falling inventories and tight nearby spreads , traders &apos; and analysts &apos; attention will continue to focus on a so-called hidden stockpile in Europe . 
on Wednesday the UK-based statistical body World Bureau of Metal Statistics ( WBMS ) shocked the market by suggesting there might be sizeable tonnages of non-LME stocks hoarded in Rotterdam . 
the WBMS said around 500,000 tonnes of copper might have accumulated in the Netherlands between 1990 and 1995 . 
mixed reactions echoed around the market , from disbelief to acceptance that there might be some credence to the WBMS report . 
on Monday the market will experience the monthly pricing against the third Wednesday prompt date . 
this usually triggers choppy and reasonable volume trading . 
nearby spreads are likely to remain tight this week . 
last week , as expected , copper &apos;s cash to three months backwardation reached $ 100 . 
further stock falls are likely to see the tightness becoming more pronounced . 
prices soared on Friday as investment funds and short-covering pushed them above light resistance at $ 2,040 , triggering aggressive buy stops . 
option covering was also noted . 
the move greatly improved the near-term chart picture . 
several traders suggested prices this week might tackle resistance at the early-September high of $ 2,165 and ultimately $ 2,200 . 
downside support was expected to emerge at $ 2,000 and $ 1,985 . 
aluminium last week ranged between $ 1,463.50 and $ 1,424.00 . 
prices this week are destined to test support at $ 1,400 against the backdrop of downtrending charts , though they may find support from an expected uptrending copper market . 
on Friday aluminium found some support from a LME inventory fall of 4,075 tonnes . 
several traders believe stocks will continue to fall this week . 
on Wednesday aluminium may find direction from the IPAI production figures for October . 
other base metals were expected to remain relatively quiet during the week , largely following the copper market .
