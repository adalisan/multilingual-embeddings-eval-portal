Japan &apos;s economic recovery needs to gain strength in order to become self-sustainable , Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) Governor Yasuo Matsushita said on Friday . 
&quot; For our nation &apos;s economy to move on to a self-sustained recovery track , the current recovery needs to gain more strength , &quot; he said at a convention of life insurers . 
he said the economic recovery is spreading to a wider area , but the tempo remains gradual . 
growth in industrial production in general remained slow with some fluctuations , reflecting inventory drawdowns in the semiconductor industry and other business sectors , he said . 
the BOJ &apos;s quarterly &quot; tankan &quot; corporate survey , released last month , showed that improvement in corporate business confidence had stalled , the governor said . 
the declining trend in domestic prices is coming to a halt , he added . 
&quot; In managing our monetary policy for the time being , we think it is appropriate to keep putting emphasis on making the basis for an economic recovery more solid , while monitoring economic developments carefully , &quot; Matsushita said in the speech . 
Japan also needs to carry out effective deregulation steps in order to enhance structural adjustments in the economy and draw more strength from the private sector , he said . 
Matsushita said Japan had much to do to regain stability in its financial system . 
&quot; The scale of bad loans that need to be disposed of is still large , and we strongly hope private financial firms will maintain their current positive stance towards write-offs , &quot; he said . 
he added financial firms must also make further efforts to restructure their business and ensure disclosure of data . 
if a financial institution faces any liquidation problem as a result of such efforts , the central bank is ready provide financial support in order to ensure stability in the financial system , Matsushita said .
