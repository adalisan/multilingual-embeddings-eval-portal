the Zimbabwe dollar was quoted softer against major currencies at the close of Tuesday interbank trade on the back of slight import pressure , dealers said . 
&quot; It looks like nothing much happened other than the Zimbabwe dollar softening slightly basically due to a few banks buying ( U.S. dollars ) in the market , &quot; commented one dealer . 
but dealers on the whole agreed that the dollar should appreciate and then stabilise when foreign currency starts flowing in during the country &apos;s annual tobacco auctions set to begin this month . 
Central Reserve Bank governor Leonard Tsumba recently echoed the same sentiment in his first monetary policy statement for 1997 . 
on Tuesday , the Zimbabwe dollar finished at 11.2750 / 2850 against the U.S. dollar , down from 11.2600 / 2700 last Thursday . 
on the crosses , it also weakened against sterling to 18.5500 / 5700 from 18.3400 / 3600 , to 6.7500 / 7700 from 6.6900 / 7100 versus the mark but was quoted stable at 2.5500 / 5700 against South Africa &apos;s rand .
