the benchmark 10-year September Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures contract edged higher on short-covering in early morning Tokyo , but the topside was expected to be limited by dollar gains against the yen , traders said . 
the Group of Seven ( G7 ) summit ended with an economic statement that was largely within the market &apos;s expectations , helping the dollar rise to above 115 yen in early trade compared to 114.80 / 90 yen at Friday &apos;s New York close . 
these gains were likely to make it difficult for the key September to rise much above 124 , traders said . 
&quot; The key contract failed to break above 124 on Friday , both in Tokyo and overseas , and is unlikely to rise much today as well , given current market factors , &quot; one trader said . 
he noted , and others agreed , that the bond market was much more interested in the auction of 10-year bonds planned for Tuesday and Wednesday &apos;s release of the Bank of Japan &apos;s ( BOJ ) &quot; tankan &quot; quarterly report of business sentiment . 
most operators were expected to sideline themselves on Monday , traders said . 
&quot; Everyone wants to see the tankan before deciding what action they want to take , &quot; one trader with a long-term credit bank said . 
in Denver on Sunday , Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said that Japan &apos;s trade surplus was unlikely to rise significantly in the medium term , but declined to address the impact of current foreign exchange rates on efforts to limit Japan &apos;s surplus . 
however , he added that Japan would not accept wild swings in the yen &apos;s exchange rate . 
U.S. President Bill Clinton warned Japan that a return to &quot; exploding &quot; trade surpluses with the United States would hurt both countries . 
he added that the decision by the Japanese government to try to pursue a path of fiscal austerity ran the risk of going back to an old export-driven strategy of growth .
