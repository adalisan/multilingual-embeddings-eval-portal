England captain Phil de Glanville has been ruled out of Saturday &apos;s rugby union test against Argentina at Twickenham with a leg strain . 
prop Jason Leonard will take over the captaincy for the first time , with Jeremy Guscott moving in from the wing to his normal position at centre . 
the reshuffle also gives winger Tony Underwood the chance to resume his international career on the wing after 18 months on the sidelines . 
Fly-half Mike Catt is also doubtful with a chest problem .
