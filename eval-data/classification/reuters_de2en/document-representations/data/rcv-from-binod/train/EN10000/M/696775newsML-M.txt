&quot; There were no real surprises in the data , &quot; Michael Metz , chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co , said . 
&quot; The consumer is still in good shape . 
sherry Cooper , chief economist at Nesbitt Burns , said she doubted the data would have much of an impact on either stocks or bonds because they came in as forecast .

the long bond was off 3 / 32 at a 6.75 percent yield .
