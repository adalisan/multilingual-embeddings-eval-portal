the U.N. Security Council will hold its first informal poll on Tuesday in the contest for secretary-general , now that Boutros Boutros-Ghali has stepped aside in the race for the top U.N. post . 
Council president Paolo Fulci said that the so-called straw poll would include the four candidates who had been nominated on Friday . 
no new names were added on Monday , he said . 
the four nominated on Friday were : Kofi Annan of Ghana , the U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping ; Hamid Algabid of Niger , secretary-general of the Organisation of Islamic Conference ; Amara Essy , foreign minister of the Ivory Coast ; and Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah of Mauritania , the former U.N. special envoy for Burundi who is executive secretary of the Washington-based Global Coalition for Africa . 
Salim A. Salim of Tanzania , the secretary-general of the Organisation of African Unity , who South African was expected to nominate on Monday , however , did not submit his name . 
any winning candidate has to get at least nine votes and no veto from one of the five permanent members -- the United States , Russia , China , Britain and France . 
but in the confusing U.N. procedures , members can vote for more than one candidate and a veto does not necessarily preclude another vote -- and another veto -- on the same candidate . 
any candidate approved by the council must be endorsed by the 185-member General Assembly .
