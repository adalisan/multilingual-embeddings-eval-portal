the Kenyan shilling suffered further losses against the dollar on Monday , and dealers said the currency &apos;s near-term outlook was gloomy after the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) cancelled a huge aid package last week . 
commercial banks reported that the shilling started Monday trade at 61.50 / 63.50 versus the dollar , softening to a range of 62 / 63.25 compared with Friday &apos;s closing rates of 60.50 / 61.50 . 
the IMF decision to suspend a $ 205 million three-year loan under its Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility ( ESAF ) in a row over corruption severely shook Kenya &apos;s foreign exchange and equity markets on Friday . 
the shilling fell as low as 64.50 following the announcement , rebounding to close at 61.50 . 
dealers said the outlook was bleak , with a nervous market and uncertainty surrounding volumes keeping spreads wide . 
&quot; pressure is there . 
orders are large , &quot; a dealer from a leading bank told Reuters , adding that orders ranged from $ 10 million to $ 20 million , and had been placed both by offshore investors and commercial players . 
on Friday , Kenyan Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi said the government would let market forces determine shilling direction , but would still try to maintain price stability . 
speaking also on Friday , Central Bank of Kenya Governor Micah Cheserem said it was not prudent for the central bank to intervene to stem the shilling slide . 
he said joining a stampede would only further fuel shilling losses . 
in his first comment on the IMF ruling , President Daniel arap Moi said on Sunday that &quot; the stoppage of financial aid to Kenya by the IMF was purely political and has no economic rationality . 
&quot; The President observed that conditionalities imposed on Kenya disregarded these social dimensions and were therefore hurting Kenyans severely , &quot; the Presidential Press Service said . 
the 73 year-old Moi , who has been in power since 1978 , faces elections this year pitting his KANU party against an opposition that has found fragile cohesion in a campaign for constitutional reform . 
no election date has been set . 
the IMF decision heaped further pressure on Moi &apos;s government , which said it would cut spending and raise revenue to meet the shortfall . 
on Monday , a World Bank official said they were &quot; watching the situation closely &quot; and that the IMF decision could certainly affect their Structural Adjustment Credit ( SAC ) to Kenya . 
a tranche of $ 45 million in the $ 125 million SAC facility has already been delayed , and the comments were likely to increase pressure on the besieged Kenyan currency .
