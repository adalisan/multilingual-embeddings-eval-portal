AMLC commentary : the rain in Queensland and northern New South Wales , coupled with continued hot and dry conditions across the lower half of Australia created a divergence between cattle markets in these areas . 
nonetheless , the improvement in seasonal conditions across the north should increase restocker activity in southern saleyards . 
some areas in the north are emerging from a prolonged period of drought and producers will no doubt be keen to rebuild herds if financial positions permit . 
the U.S. beef market moved higher this week as traders who have sold product forward moved to cover their positions . 
prices for boxed beef increased 1-2 USc / lb , while those for U.S. manufacturing beef moved five USc / lb higher . 
this in turn jolted futures prices , which moved between 1-3USc / lb higher with the February and April contracts showing the greatest gains . 
U.S. fed cattle prices gained one USc / lb to 65USc / lb . 
in Japan , the beef market stabilised this week to some extent as currency markets settled down . 
demand in Japan , however , remains fairly stagnant . 
new business in response to imminent spring market sales is not yet apparent . 
demand for frozen beef did start to surface this week , according to trade sources , in response to decreasing inventories and also the imminent drop in the import duty . 
in the interim , buyers not wanting to get caught with expensive meat and the higher tariff have only been buying to cover immediate needs . 
with market demand already slow , little is expected to change before early March .
