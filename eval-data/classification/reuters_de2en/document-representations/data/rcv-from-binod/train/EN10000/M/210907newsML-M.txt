sterling was flushed with success on Friday after a week repeatedly setting four-year records , and confidently awaiting a UK budget expected to feed its rally . 
but after a rally which has seen the pound firm more than 13 percent against the dollar since May , sentiment was dented by fears its strength would harm British industry , and chart analysts warned a corrective pullback was just a matter of time . 
&quot; The nature of the move we &apos;ve had suggests we &apos;re going to get a significant correction , &quot; said David Sneddon , technical analyst at Credit Suisse . 
&quot; It &apos;s just a question of when . 
technical analysts , who use charts to predict future price moves , are pencilling in medium-term target zones around $ 1.70 and 2.62 marks , once corrective activity is over . 
sterling was quoted at 2.5297 marks and $ 1.6840 at European midsession . 
on Thursday , it hit a 31-month peak of 2.5336 marks , touched $ 1.6905 -- its best level on the dollar since October 1992 -- and made a four-year high on a trade-weighted basis . 
sterling has climbed 17 percent from the all-time low of 2.1683 marks it plumbed just a year ago . 
healthy UK economic fundamentals , rising interest rates and bullish technicals factors , combined with the fact it has lagged comparable units , have all helped catapult the pound higher across the board . 
but the currency &apos;s rise , making exports pricier and imports cheaper , has begun to raise fears over UK competitiveness . 
&quot; Many businesses have been telling us anecdotally for the last couple of weeks that they do feel that the exchange rate is getting to a level where it could have a significant effect upon competitiveness both on exports and on import penetration , &quot; Adair Turner , director general of the Confederation of British Industry , was quoted as saying in a Friday newspaper . 
the Financial Times said UK companies such as British Steel and chemicals group Courtaulds plc had expressed concern at sterling &apos;s strength . 
analysts said the pound was unnerved a little by those reports , as well as by a broad-based upmove by the mark . 
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ll see any substantial reversal , though we may see sterling settle back at about 2.50 marks , which I think is a more manageable level , &quot; said Stephen Hannah , director of research at IBJ International . 
levels below there are unlikely given the UK &apos;s attractive interest rate spread against other markets and its safe haven status from European monetary union jitters , analysts said . 
&quot; The economic backdrop remains favourable and the chances of another modest rate rise are still there , &quot; Hannah noted . 
the UK raised interest rates by a quarter-point to six percent on October 30 , and an avalanche of strong economic data has convinced the market more tightening is in the pipeline . 
this week has seen a hefty 4.4 billion sterling ( $ 7.41 billion ) government debt repayment , boosted by a welter of corporate tax receipts , a 10.3 increase in broad money supply and solid retail sales figures -- all signs of buoyant consumer activity . 
the October debt repayment data largely soothed fears that public finances could ill afford the modest tax cuts the market expects out of the 1997 budget , which Chancellor Kenneth Clarke will unveil on November 26 . 
the pound should react well to a cautious budget , analysts said . 
&quot; Anything which keeps the economy on a stable footing rather than allowing some head of steam to build up typically goes down well in currency markets , &quot; said IBJ &apos;s Hannah . 
as for interest rates , the market is now focusing on the next monetary meeting between Clarke and Bank of England governor Eddie George amid speculation of more tightening . 
if he gives the market a tight budget , he might just get away with not raising rates at all , &quot; said David Coleman , chief economist at CIBC .
