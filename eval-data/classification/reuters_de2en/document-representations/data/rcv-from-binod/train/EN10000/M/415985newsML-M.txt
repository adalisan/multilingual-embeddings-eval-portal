European bourses began mixed on Monday , nervous over developments across the Atlantic , where Wall Street suffered its third fall in a row on Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s warning on lofty stock prices fuelled speculation about an interest rate hike . 
on the currency front , the dollar was more than half a pfennig higher against the mark in early trading after a German Sunday newspaper report said a relentless rise in German unemployment continued in February . 
in London , Europe &apos;s biggest bourse , shares were moderately lower in early trade as market makers marked down prices after Wall Street &apos;s 47-point decline on Friday . 
dealers said weaker U.S. treasuries and British bonds also unsettled early investor sentiment , as did growing political uncertainties ahead of the looming British general election . 
&quot; There isn &apos;t any panic this morning . 
just a mark down , &quot; the head of trading at a major securities house said . 
&quot; Considering Wall Street had a bad week , the FTSE hasn &apos;t done too badly . 
one big faller was NatWest Bank , as the stock went ex-dividend and in reaction to news last Friday that it had lost 50 million pounds ( $ 81 million ) on options trading . 
political worries ahead of a British election , due by May , were unsettling investor sentiment , dealers said . 
&quot; After last week &apos;s by-election ( which the ruling Conservative Party lost by a big margin ) people are starting to focus on the fact of a change of government , &quot; the head of trading at a major investment bank said . 
&quot; That , added to Wall Street &apos;s weakness , is keeping people away . 
essentially there is no reason to buy this market at the moment . 
in Frankfurt , German shares opened bourse trade flat after moving mostly sideways in pre-bourse electronic dealings . 
traders said there was a lack of significant market-moving information . 
on the Paris bourse , French shares pushed higher at the opening , drawing comfort from a strong dollar versus the mark and shrugging off Wall Street &apos;s lower close , but later fell back to show limited gains . 
the dollar firmed above 1.69 marks after Bild am Sonntag reported that German unemployment rose by 120,000 to a new postwar record of 4.8 million last month following a 500,000 rise in January . 
a rise of that magnitude would lift the jobless rate to 12.5 percent from 12.2 percent , the paper said . 
sharply divergent employment trends in Germany and the United States in recent months have been among the key driving forces behind the dollar / mark &apos;s surge higher this year . 
&quot; The leak of the German numbers should prove to be supportive for the dollar / mark and sterling / mark as well . 
but for the mark against the rest of Europe it is a bit of double-edged sword , &quot; said Jeremy Hawkins , chief economic adviser at Bank of America . 
news of a further spiral higher in German jobless numbers would support a recent widening in the U.S. / German 10-year bond yield spread to more than 100 basis points . 
however , it also makes it more difficult for Germany to meet 1997 budget deficit targets necessary to start European monetary union in 1999 . 
the dollar was at 1.6920 marks and 120.65 yen , compared with 1.6885 and 120.88 in late European trade on Friday . 
gold opened firmer at $ 362.50 from London &apos;s previous close of $ 358.45 . 
silver was higher at 532 cents . 
( $ = 0.615 British Pounds )
