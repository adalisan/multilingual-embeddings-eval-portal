Israeli and Palestinian officials indicated on Sunday that agreement was near on a landmark face-to-face meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat . 
their remarks followed Netanyahu &apos;s strongest indication yet that the Israeli leader , facing threats of a renewed Palestinian uprising should the peace process founder , would soon hold talks with Arafat . 
&quot; When the matter is agreed upon , and I hope that already today it will be settled , then within days there will be such a meeting , &quot; Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told reporters following talks in Alexandria with Egyptian leaders . 
levy and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak discussed Israeli-Palestinian relations , which have plunged in the past week to their lowest point since Netanyahu &apos;s right-religious government was elected last May . 
Ahmed tibi , an adviser to Arafat , said behind-the-scenes talks had been underway since Friday to pave the way for a Netanyahu-Arafat summit . 
&quot; Last night and this morning there were prolonged contacts in one of the cities of ( Israel &apos;s ) coastal plain , &quot; tibi said . 
&quot; I hope that the Israeli side can improve its proposals with respect to substance , because the principle of holding the meeting has already ceased to be a problem , &quot; he told army radio . 
earlier , asked about reports he would meet Arafat this week , Netanyahu told the radio : &quot; I have said that when the developments allow , we would announce the meeting -- and indeed , there are all sorts of developments . 
&quot; He did not elaborate . 
Netanyahu , who opposes trading occupied land for peace , had said he was in no hurry to meet Arafat but softened his line a week ago after President Ezer Weizman signalled he would see the Palestinian leader if the prime minister refused . 
Netanyahu has angered Palestinians by rejecting Jewish settlement construction curbs declared by the centre-left governments of former prime minister Shimon Peres and his slain predecessor Yitzhak Rabin . 
Israel formally dismissed the PLO chief as a &quot; terrorist &quot; until secret talks were capped by a Rabin-Arafat handshake in a historic White House ceremony in 1993 . 
last week , in a move widely seen as a slap to Arafat , Israel demolished an Arab community centre it said was built illegally in East Jerusalem , just two days after the PLO leader bowed to a Netanyahu demand to close two Palestinian offices in the city . 
Israel views Palestinian political activity in the holy city &apos;s Arab eastern half as a challenge to the Jewish state &apos;s claims of sovereignty over the sector it captured in the 1967 Middle East war . 
both sides see East Jerusalem as their capital . 
Arafat , going on the offensive , then stunned Israel by telling his legislature Netanyahu &apos;s policy on settlements and Jerusalem was tantamount to declaring war on the Palestinians . 
Arafat also sparked an Israeli security alert by urging Moslems to converge on East Jerusalem &apos;s al-Aqsa mosque for prayers on Friday , and calling on Christians to flock to Jerusalem &apos;s holiest church on Sunday , to protest at the policies of the Netanyahu government . 
but Israeli roadblocks blocked West Bank Palestinians from reaching the places of worship , where numbers of congregants were close to that of usual crowds of worshippers . 
Arafat warned Israel on Friday that Israel had other options if the Jewish state did not honour its agreements with the PLO , citing resumption of the intifada , the Palestinian uprising that began in late 1987 . 
Palestinians are demanding that Israel carry out a troop withdrawal from the West Bank city of Hebron agreed by the previous Labour-led government . 
the partial pullback from Hebron , home to 100,000 Arabs and around 400 Jewish settlers , was postponed after Islamic suicide bombings in February and March killed 59 people in Israel .
