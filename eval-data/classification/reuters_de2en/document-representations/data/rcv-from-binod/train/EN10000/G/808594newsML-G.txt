Syria , Lebanon and Iran on Tuesday strongly condemned Monday &apos;s shelling of south Lebanon port of Sidon and held Israel responsible for the attack which killed seven people . 
&quot; Syria and Lebanon condemn the brutal Israeli aggressions against Lebanese civilians and children in Sidon and south Lebanon , &quot; Prime ministers Mahmoud zu &apos;bi of Syria and Rafik al-Hariri of Lebanon said in a statement issued after talks in Damascus . 
in Tehran , Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said &quot; the continued crimes of the Zionist regime ( Israel ) indicated its war-mongering and hostile nature &quot; , the Iranian news agency IRNA reported . 
Israel said its forces were not responsible for the shelling of Sidon and blamed forces under the command of its south Lebanon militia ally Antoine Lahd for the attack which killed seven civilians and wounded 36 . 
Syria , the main foreign power broker in Lebanon where it has some 35,000 troops , is a member of a five-member international group set to monitor a ceasefire in Lebanon between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas fighting Israeli forces occupying a border zone in south Lebanon . 
officials said that Hariri , in Syria to discuss economic cooperation , met Vice-President Abdel-Halim Khaddam twice to discuss the escalation of tension in south Lebanon . 
they said the discussion covered issues to be tackled by the monitoring group during its forthcoming meeting in south Lebanon on Thursday . 
the group also includes Lebanon , Israel , France and the United States . 
the monitoring group was set up in April 1996 under a U.S.-brokered accord which ended a 17-day Israeli offensive in Lebanon during which 200 people , mostly civilians , were killed . 
the pro-Iranian Hizbollah retaliated for the Sidon shelling by firing scores of Katyusha rockets into northern Israel on Tuesday , wounding one civlian . 
IRNA said Mohammadi also &quot; criticised the indifference of the international community toward violations of international law and repetition of the Zionist crimes against Moslems &quot; .
