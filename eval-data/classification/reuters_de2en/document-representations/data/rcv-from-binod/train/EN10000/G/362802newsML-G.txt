Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila on Friday rejected international mediation to end Africa &apos;s latest war in Zaire and said his troops were advancing on several fronts against the country &apos;s ragged army . 
Kabila , speaking to Reuters shortly before midnight at an opulent residence that has been used by ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko , said the war was an internal matter that must be resolved by the Zaireans . 
he was responding to calls from several African nations for international mediation in the war sparked off by Zairean attempts to expel the Banyamulenge -- an ethnic Tutsi group -- back to Rwanda , a land they left up to 200 years ago . 
the Banyamulenge took up arms to resist the expulsions and joined Kabila , a veteran opposition figure against Mobutu &apos;s rule . 
but Kabila , head of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire ( ADFL ) , said he was willing to meet Mobutu on a one-to-one basis to discuss Mobutu &apos;s handover of power . 
the U.N. Security Council in New York expressed grave concern on Friday over the deteriorating situation in Central Africa and warned states to stay out of Zaire &apos;s civil war . 
Mobutu returned to Kinshasa after medical tests in Europe , Zairean state radio reported . 
&quot; We are not at all interested in the internationalisation of the Zairean conflict . 
there is no need for international or regional mediation in our conflict , &quot; Kabila said . 
&quot; Mobutu must come and talk to us on how to hand over power , otherwise we shall continue with the military campaign and remove him . 
the confident-sounding rebel chief , buoyed by stunning battlefield victories against Mobutu &apos;s retreating forces , also rejected calls for an international military force to end the conflict in Africa &apos;s second-largest country after Sudan . 
&quot; We are totally against the idea of an international or multinational force . 
this country has seen too much international interventions in the past and it is these interventions that put us in a mess , &quot; he said . 
Kabila said his forces continued to advance on several fronts and had captured the refugee camp of Amisi outside the town of Lubutu , home to thousands of Rwandan Hutus who fled further towards the city of Kisangani . 
&quot; We have taken Amisi and our forces are 19 km ( 12 miles ) outside the town of Lubutu , &quot; he said . 
Kabila said his forces continued to advance throughout the north of the country , surrounding the town of Isiro near the Sudan-Uganda border , and pushing further south on the town of Moba , a gateway to the mineral-rich Shaba province . 
he dismissed reports of government troops recapturing Shabunda and Watsa as &quot; reckless propaganda by the government in Kinshasa &quot; . 
the Zairean defence ministry reported that Zairean troops had retaken Watsa in the northeast , killing 800 rebels , and Shabunda in the east . 
&quot; We are firmly in control of the two towns and Kinshasa does not have the slightest capacity to make a counter-offensive on our positions , &quot; Kabila said before inviting journalists to visit the towns . 
the rebel leader said his forces were also beseiging a huge airfield and army base at Kindu , one of two bases for Kinshasa &apos;s counter-offensive . 
&quot; We are moving and we expect to reach Kindu in the next few days . 
this is a people &apos;s popular war against tyranny , &quot; he said . 
a senior Zairean defence official said in Kinshasa on Friday that heavy fighting had broken out around the gold and tin mining town of Punia and that it was in danger of falling to rebels . 
Punia is about 70 km ( 45 miles ) south of Lubutu , which guards the road to the Upper Zaire provincial capital of Kisangani .
