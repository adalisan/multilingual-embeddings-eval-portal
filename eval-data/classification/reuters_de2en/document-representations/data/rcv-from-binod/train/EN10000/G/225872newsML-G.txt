three Italian aid workers abducted in Chechnya have been released after being held for more than two months , the Italian Foreign Ministry said on Friday . 
further details were not immediately available . 
the aid workers , who belonged to the non-governmental group inter SOS , were last seen on September 26 when they set off by car from Nazran in Ingushetia , a region bordering Chechnya , to deliver medicine and equipment to a war-damaged hospital in the Chechen capital Grozny . 
tens of thousands of people , mainly civilians , have been killed in the conflict between Russian troops and Chechen separatists . 
fighting largely halted under a ceasefire last August but no solution has been found to the central dispute of whether or not Chechnya should remain part of Russia . 
President Boris Yeltsin issued a controversial decree last Saturday ordering Russia &apos;s last units to leave Chechnya before planned regional elections .
