cash crude prices tracked a firming NYMEX market to talk late Monday some 35 cents higher for benchmark August West Texas Intermediate / Cushing barrels . 
stronger prices came on the back of a technically bullish move in the futures sector . 
talk of Iraqi oil sales being delayed until August also aided the prompt market , traders said , allowing August / September spreads to close to only four cents in favor of the second month from wider numbers Friday . 
August WTI / Cushing was around $ 19.75-85 a barrel late Monday , 30-035 cents stronger . 
domestic grade barrels saw Light Louisiana sweet / St. 
James sell between 17-20 cents over the marker , steady from Friday . 
traders said Brent offerings in the U.S. Gulf at WTI -25 cents for August delivery left LLS as an attractive economic choice for refiners . 
other deals saw WTI / Cushing postings Plus sell at $ 1.90 , and Eugene Island sour swamp barrels move at a $ 1.35 discount . 
other grades talked mostly unchanged from Friday , with only nominal interest in moving barrels . 
traders had expected business to move sluggishly ahead of the U.S. 
independence Day holiday on Friday . 
outside news continued to swirl around the timing for Iraqi oil sales to return to market . 
even though Iraq has been allowed to sell oil from June 8 as part of the second round of oil-for-food deal allowances , the fact Baghdad has not completed an aid distribution plan has delayed liftings .
