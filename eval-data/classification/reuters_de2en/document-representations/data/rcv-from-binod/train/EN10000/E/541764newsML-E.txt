developing countries which have been undertaking difficult financial reforms want their rewards of $ 7.7 billion in debt relief from the International Monetary Fund , and they want it quickly , according to a draft communique obtained by Reuters on Saturday . 
it said prolonged delays would limit the effectiveness of the debt initiative , make it harder to sustain economic reforms and erode domestic political support . 
the poor countries will seek a more flexible application of a new initiative to ease the debt burden of the world &apos;s poorest countries and want the deal to kick in quickly for states which meet IMF goals . 
a draft communique of the Group of 24 countries -- representing developing states in Asia , Africa and Latin America -- said the IMF should consider selling gold to ease debt burdens . 
&quot; Deputies considered the sale of a portion of the Fund &apos;s gold holdings as a necessary supplement to bilateral contributions , &quot; the communique said . 
the communique is due to be released on Sunday by ministers of the G24 , who are meeting during the spring gathering of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund . 
the debt deal , known as the Highly Indebted Poor Countries &apos; initiative , was launched six months ago by the World Bank and IMF . 
it aims to reward poor countries that are carrying out tough economic reforms by providing them with debt relief . 
up to 25 countries , most in Africa , are expected to benefit from the plan , which could cost creditors as much as $ 7.7 billion . 
but critics , complaining about rules which could delay the implementation of the agreement for up to three years for some states , say the deal may kick in too late to be of much use . 
the G24 urged that the application of the poor countries initiative be accelerated . 
&quot; Its terms should be made more flexible to enable more of the indebted countries to reach debt sustainability as early as possible , &quot; it said . 
&quot; The time frames involved in getting countries to the decision and completion points need to be shortened , particularly for those that have already established strong performance track records , &quot; the communique said .
