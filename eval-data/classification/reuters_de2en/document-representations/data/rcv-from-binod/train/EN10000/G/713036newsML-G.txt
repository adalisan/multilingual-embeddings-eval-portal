President Ernesto Zedillo extended the hand of friendship to opposition parties late on Monday , the day after mid-term elections that dealt his party its biggest setback in 68 years of rule . 
responding to the new political landscape in Mexico , in which preliminary results showed his party was likely to have lost its decades-old majority in the lower house of Congress , Zedillo praised all political parties and spoke of a &quot; new era &quot; of cooperation between them . 
he paid a special tribute to the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) , which won control of the capital of Mexico in mayoral elections and gained unexpected ground in the national legislative vote . 
it was a huge advance on its 1994 performance in the presidential race , after which the party almost crumbled , and signalled a resurgence of the left in Mexico . 
&quot; I have always thought that a party of the left , a strong one , as the PRD showed it was yesterday , is good for Mexico , &quot; Zedillo said , in a suprising show of support from a leader whose government had often sparred openly with the PRD . 
he also praised the conservative National Action Party ( PAN ) , considered closer to Zedillo ideologically , as a party with broad national support . 
his remarks , during a speech at the presidential mansion of Los Pinos , reflected his obvious desire to work with the opposition , so that congressional gridlock does not block his legislative agenda . 
&quot; Following yesterdays &apos;s elections , all parties are entering a new era in which contest has been left behind and in which now we must promote dialogue , agreement and consensus , &quot; he said . 
in the lower house race , with more than 85 percent of the votes counted , the pri had 38.9 percent of the vote -- not enough to give it an absolute majority -- followed by the PAN with 27 percent and the PRD with 25.6 percent . 
Zedillo also sought to highlight the role of his own party in the elections , saying it had pushed through the electoral laws that levelled the political playing field in Mexico and that underscored the pri &apos;s own democratic credentials . 
&quot; After these elections , now no one call call the pri the only party , the party of the state or an appendix of government , &quot; Zedillo said . 
he noted that it remained the biggest party and retained a majority in the Senate , and had achieved that in elections widely considered to be clean . 
in the past , the pri was often accused of using fraud to maintain its grip on power , that it has held unbroken since 1929 .
