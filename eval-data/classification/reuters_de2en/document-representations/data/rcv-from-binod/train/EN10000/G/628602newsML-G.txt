democratic Republic of Congo troops opened fire on a protest march in the eastern town of Uvira , killing a number of people , humanitarian sources said on Saturday . 
the sources , witnesses and traders who took part in the protest on Monday gave different death tolls , ranging up to 40 . 
the sources , who have close contact with the region and were contacted from the the former Zaire &apos;s capital Kinshasa , said demonstrators were protesting after the discovery of five corpses of Uvira residents abducted from their homes . 
&quot; The army opened fire as the demonstrators were approaching the governor &apos;s house with the five bodies , &quot; one source said . 
&quot; It was not clear who was responsible for the deaths of the five people but the population demonstrated as though it was the AFDL , &quot; the source said , adding 20 were killed . 
the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo ( AFDL ) took over Kinshasa on May 17 . 
demonstrations have been banned across the vast country since then . 
Alliance officials were not immediately available for comment . 
traders who took part in the demonstration said 40 people were killed when AFDL troops opened fire as protesters carried the bodies of eight people killed on Sunday . 
&quot; The military shot in the air and we continued and then they shot us and there were lots of dead , more than 40 , &quot; one trader who declined to be identified told Reuters . 
a senior aid official in the Burundian capital Bujumbura said it was unclear how many died . 
&quot; Alliance troops opened fire on people carrying the bodies of the dead on Monday and rather a lot of people were killed , but it &apos;s not clear exactly how many , &quot; said the aid official . 
Uvira residents fled to Bujumbura after the killings , aid workers said . 
&quot; We are not happy with the Tutsi military because they kill people without pity and they consider everyone an enemy , &quot; a businessman said who fled the killings to Bujumbura said . 
Uvira , close to the Burundian border , was the first town to fall to the AFDL at the start of a campaign to oust president Mobutu Sese Seko last October . 
persecution of ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge people by Hutus and regional authorities in the eastern part of former Zaire triggered the seven-month civil war . 
tension between Babembe and Bafulero people and the Banyamulenge who dominate local authorities lies behind the Uvira killings , according to aid sources . 
AFDL leader Laurent Kabila was sworn in as president on Thursday . 
the alliance has been dogged by reports of human rights abuses . 
the U.N. Security Council called on Thursday for an end to killings of Hutu refugees following reports of massacres by alliance troops .
