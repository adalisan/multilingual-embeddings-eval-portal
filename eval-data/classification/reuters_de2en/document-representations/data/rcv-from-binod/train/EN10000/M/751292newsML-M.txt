average retail gasoline prices in Japan fell to 102 yen per litre as of July 10 , down from 104 yen a month ago and the lowest since a survey of retail prices began 10 years ago , the Oil Information Service Centre said on Wednesday . 
retail gasoline prices have lost four yen per litre over the last three months . 
&quot; The price decline is due partly to cuts in wholesale prices , but it also reflects intense sales competition among gasoline stations , &quot; an official at the centre said . 
major Japanese oil firms cut their wholesale prices for gasoline by 0.2 to 0.3 yen per litre for July delivery , reflecting lower crude oil import costs . 
the official said that a cut-throat gasoline price war , which had been largely restricted to metropolitan areas and surrounding regions , seems to be spreading to other parts of the country .
