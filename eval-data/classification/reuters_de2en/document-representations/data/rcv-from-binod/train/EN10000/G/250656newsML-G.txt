the limousine of New Zealand &apos;s prime minister was set on fire early on Wednesday just hours after his party emerged victorious from two months of tortuous coalition negotiations . 
assistant Commissioner Neville Trendle , the police commander , said police and the diplomatic protection squad would review Prime Minister Jim Bolger &apos;s security after the incident . 
on Tuesday evening , Bolger &apos;s caretaker National Party was chosen as the preferred coalition partner by the nationalist New Zealand First Party , which has held the balance of power since an inclusive election in October . 
the announcement ended two months of political suspense . 
it disappointed supporters of the centre-left Labour Party , which had been vying for NZ First &apos;s attentions , and NZ First voters who wanted their party to return Labour to power after six years in opposition . 
detective Inspector Brett Kane said some type of accelerant , believed to be petrol , was used to start the fire , which gutted the car &apos;s interior and severely damaged the back of the vehicle . 
the car had been parked overnight outside the Wellington home of Bolger &apos;s chauffeur . 
the Fire Service was called to the fire at 12.50 a.m. after neighbours were awakened by a car alarm and then an explosion . 
residents had extinguished the fire by the time firemen arrived , Kane said . 
no arrests have been made , but police inquiries were continuing . 
police said they wanted to interview a young man who bought petrol in the neighbourhood earlier in the evening .
