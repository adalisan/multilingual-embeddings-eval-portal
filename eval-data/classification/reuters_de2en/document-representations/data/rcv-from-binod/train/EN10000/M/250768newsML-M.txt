Hong Kong stocks reversed course on Wednesday afternoon to close sharply down , due to inflation and currency worries and negative trends in local and overseas futures markets , brokers said . 
&quot; We are again held hostage by U.S. economic statistics , &quot; said Mark Simpson , head of Hong Kong research at ING Barings Securities . 
the Hang Seng Index fell 152.86 points to close at 13,189.60 , after swinging from a high of 13,473.26 in the morning to a low of 13,125.93 in mid-afternoon . 
the U.S. producer price report for November is due out later on Wednesday and consumer price data on Thursday . 
analysts said the inflation numbers gained more importance after Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said late last week that the Fed must be wary when irrational exuberance affects stocks and assets . 
the contract fell 12 points in the afternoon , ostensibly on a U.S. newspaper report that the Japanese government and other governments may reduce their purchases of U.S. treasuries . 
rumours of a big seller in HSI futures in Hong Kong kept it down , &quot; said Glenn Lesko , head of equities trading at HG Asia . 
remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin indicating he favoured a strong U.S. dollar were also cited as depressing futures markets , Lesko said . 
the local equity market &apos;s downturn came despite the smooth conclusion of the selection of Tung Chee-hwa as the territory &apos;s first post-colonial chief executive and better than expected price in the government &apos;s land auction on Wednesday afternoon , brokers said . 
brokers said the positive aspects of the selection of Tung , tipped as Beijing &apos;s favourite , had been discounted by the market . 
Sino Land bought one of the two sites on auction for a total of HK $ 760 million . 
the other site was sold to an unlisted company . 
finance shares led the market down .
