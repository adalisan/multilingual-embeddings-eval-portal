the appointment of a new Slovak Foreign Minister , Zdenka Kramplova , heralds no change in the country &apos;s foreign policy , Kramplova told the official Slovak news agency TASR on Friday . 
&quot; There are no reasons for that ( change ) , &quot; TASR quoted Kramplova as saying . 
&quot; Membership of NATO and the European Union and good relations with neighbouring countries remain our priorities , &quot; she added . 
earlier this week , Kramplova , the first Slovak women foreign minster , replaced Pavol Hamzik who resigned in protest at the domestic political situation and failed referendums on NATO membership and direct presidential elections . 
the appointment of Kramplova , a little known figure whose party affiliations are unclear , was pushed by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar apparently without consulting his coalition government partners . 
&quot; We consider it abnormal that we should seek such important personal information just through media , &quot; Slovak National Party vice-chairman Anna Malikova told a news conference on Friday .
