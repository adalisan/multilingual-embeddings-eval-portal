U.S. base metal markets ticked over steadily this week with few major features , though there appeared to be some disappointment with lead as battery makers have not stepped up offtake , traders and producers said . 
&quot; Nothing seems to be happening - the battery season has not been noticed , &quot; a North American lead producer said . 
another producer talked of a slowdown in business this month . 
&quot; It was not a big selling season this summer and we did not have a lot of hot weather , but the battery manufacturers continued to produce , &quot; the producer said . 
prolonged hot weather damages lead acid auto batteries . 
lead premiums of 3.0 to 4.0 cents per pound over LME cash were reported for fairly large deals , with 6.0 cent for prompt , truckload quantities . 
battery scrap supply was said to be tightening slightly after being plentiful over the summer . 
zinc was steady but uneventful with premiums over LME cash generally at 5.25 to 5.75 cents per pound , with less talk of 6.0 cents per pound . 
confirmation by Asturiana de zinc that it had liquidated its huge position on LME caused barely a ripple . 
&quot; The big factor is whether LME stocks continue to come down , &quot; a broker said . 
nickel was said to be dull with premiums for melting quality metal at 9 to 12 cents per pound , about a cent off the high in recent weeks . 
the nickel plating market was fairly active , however , one merchant noted . 
nickel failed to follow copper upsurge on Friday due to immediate poor fundamentals , a broker said . 
&quot; There still seems to be some destocking at stainless steel producers . 
I expect a pick up in the second quarter of 1997 , &quot; he added . 
copper copper demand was still healthy with traders firmly believing that by now , a good portion of the metal leaving LME Long Beach was for U.S. consumption . 
the big flood from Long Beach into COMEX &apos;s Arizona warehouses was over , they said . 
premiums over spot COMEX on cathode were a firm 2.75 to 3.00 cents per pound , with one trader adding it was relatively easy to get the top end of the range . 
many traders were taking a close look at COMEX &apos;s Baltimore depot following talk that several thousand tons of copper was being delivered there , arriving from LME depots in Europe .
