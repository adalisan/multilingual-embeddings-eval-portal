MTBE producers are feeling the pinch in their operating margins as high prices for the feedstock butane drive up production costs , analysts say . 
&quot; The main problem right now for producers are normal butane prices , &quot; said Brian Grigsby , a consultant with Chemical Market Associates Inc ( CMAI ) in Houston . 
U.S. Gulf Coast normal butane prices are at a seasonally high 49 cents a gallon , six cents above year ago levels . 
prices began to rise in March , when petrochemical firms began drawing heavily on stocks already stressed by the harsh winter . 
and pricey normal butane may persist in the near future , buoyed by already low inventories going into the September start of the gasoline blending season , according to butane traders . 
the cost of making one gallon of MTBE recently hit 82.30 cents , sharply squeezing producers profit margins on a spot MTBE barrel for sale at 85 cents . 
&quot; That only gives producers about 3 cents for debt repayment and the rest for profits , &quot; said Grigsby , who uses a formula of 17 cents as the average of plant operating costs above feedstock values . 
&quot; It has not been a real profitable year for producers , &quot; said Grigsby . 
he added that plants in July received a return of about 19.7 cents above the cost of feedstocks , leaving about 2.7 cents for profit . 
in recent months , plant costs have risen to as much as 25 cents , and in February fell to such levels that many plants found it more economical to shut down . 
August does not seem to carry a much better forecast . 
&quot; So far for August the number above the feedstock cost is about 22 cents , which leaves producers with about 5 cents for profit and debt repayment , &quot; said Grigsby . 
plants often consider shutting down if they can not get at least 12 or 13 cents above the cost of raw materials . 
Grigsby and others , however , do not see any plant shutdowns in the next few months given the approach of the oxygenated fuel season combined with scheduled maintenance turnarounds at four major U.S. MTBE plants next month . 
according to CMAI , MTBE is likely to have a 50 percent greater share of the oxy fuel market because of low ethanol production , an alternative gasoline additive most popular in the U.S. midwest . 
&quot; MTBE will have to take over from some of the ethanol based areas , &quot; said Grigsby . 
an inventory decline of nearly two percent to 9.16 million barrels of MTBE in July will also help tighten the MTBE market and help breathe some life into margins , Grigsby added .
