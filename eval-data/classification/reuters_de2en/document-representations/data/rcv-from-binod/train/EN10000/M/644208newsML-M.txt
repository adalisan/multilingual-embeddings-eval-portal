Madrid , June 6 ( Reuter ) 1030 GMT - Madrid stocks found room to swing upward at midday on Friday with attention focused more on good domestic economic indicators than on the external factors that were keeping other markets in a holding pattern . 
&quot; Domestic data are good and the truth is there &apos;s no reason the market should fall , which gives our market a bit of autonomy , &quot; one dealer said . 
the general index gained 7.25 points , 1.28 percent , to 573.49 and Ibex-35 rose 83.6 points , 1.28 percent , to 6,596.09 . 
dealers said U.S. jobs data expected at 1230 GMT was an important factor , but Madrid &apos;s bourse was basically ignoring it . 
traders said they were surprised that the market was not more depressed ahead of the data . 
&quot; As the data is expected to reveal inflationary tensions , it is easy predict what will happen : wall Street will sell-off , &quot; one dealer said . 
among individual stocks , the banking sector posted sharp gains . 
Repsol was up 80 pesetas at 6,370 , while Telefonica gained 20 to 4,340 .
