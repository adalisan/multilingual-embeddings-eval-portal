the New Zealand dollar drifted lower during the day to close at US $ 0.6997 / 04 from its 0.7008 / 15 opening . 
dealers said there was buying on any dips and selling capping the kiwi at 0.7020-30 . 
offshore interest was dominating trading with no apparent concern at a Trade weighted Index of 66.55 against the Reserve Bank &apos;s assumption of 65 in its economic projections released last week . 
&quot; I would be surprised to see the Reserve Bank saying anything so close to the election , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; They would be on a hiding to nothing . 
after the election , if National wins , they may say &apos; OK today we have got to do something &apos; . 
he said the kiwi was likely to trade in a range from 0.6990 to 0.7020 or 0.6980 to 0.7030 &quot; on the wide &quot; overnight . 
tomorrow &apos;s National Business Review-Consultus poll would make &quot; no difference &quot; . 
&quot; We are still three weeks out from the election . 
compare that with the 1993 election when the ( ruling ) National Party was going to win by ten seats and we got a hung parliament .
