oil-rich Kazakhstan , which plans to form a viable shares market this year , says players in the yet-to-be-formed market must meet tough standards to win investor confidence . 
national Securities Commission chairman Grigory Marchenko told a news conference on Wednesday that he would be hard on Kazakh brokers and dealing firms which did not boost their capital to $ 130,000 by April 15 from $ 70,000 at present . 
&quot; Starting April 15 , the minimum capital of broker and dealer companies should rise to $ 130,000 , and this measure may cut the number of these companies to 15-20 from today &apos;s 75 , &quot; he said . 
Kazakhstan , which has already set up a new stock exchange and designated 56 local firms as blue chip companies , plans to complete work on a central share depository and on bank custodians for domestic securities by May . 
Marchenko has said he hopes the market will be fully operational by the end of the year . 
Marchenko , a former deputy head of the Kazakh Central Bank , said the main purpose of the new rules was to ensure that poorly capitalised brokers and dealers did not abuse peoples &apos; savings or shatter their trust in economic reform . 
&quot; If you yourself have not earned enough money , why should people trust you ? 
&quot; he asked . 
he said the changes were needed to attract serious foreign investors to the blue chip firms forming the core of the market . 
the blue chips are mostly in the energy and processing sectors . 
he did not exclude even tougher capitalisation rules in the future . 
&quot; No foreign investors will work with the dealer whose capital is less than $ 1 million , &quot; he said . 
Marchenko told Reuters later that besides 15-20 Kazakh companies which would meet the tougher rules , 12-15 foreign broker and dealer companies could start working on the Kazakh market , and some had already applied for registration . 
all companies slated for sell-offs to portfolio investors on the stock market must undergo international auditing for 1996 and bring accountancy into line with international standards . 
&quot; Our policy is to protect investors ... We are interested in the maximum transparency of all information for potential investors , &quot; Marchenko said . 
he said the first stakes in large local companies could be put up for sale on the Kazakh Stock Exchange as early as May after a special governmental order . 
next year &apos;s planned reform of Kazakhstan &apos;s national pension scheme would also help develop the stock market . 
private pension funds must replace the present-day bankrupt state pension fund within 10 years and accumulate pension fees from individuals . 
special companies would manage their assets . 
Marchenko said these companies , which would manage the savings of up to a quarter of Kazakhstan &apos;s 16.9 million people , would be strictly controlled and licensed by his commission . 
&quot; At the first stage , we will allow pension funds to invest only in blue chips , &quot; said Marchenko , adding the government would later define other segments of the market , including Treasury bills , in which pension funds could invest safely .
