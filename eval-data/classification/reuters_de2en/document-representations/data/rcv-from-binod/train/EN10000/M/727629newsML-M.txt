the Philippine 91-day treasury bill yield rose to 13.217 percent from the previous 12.175 percent , the Bureau of Treasury said on Monday . 
yields on the other maturities also rose . 
the 182-day bill rose to 14.018 percent from 12.535 last week . 
the 364-day bill rose to 14.228 percent from 13.183 . 
the auction attracted only 2.58 billion pesos worth of tenders , of which only 686 million pesos were accepted by the committee . 
traders said there was little appetite for T-bills because of the high carrying cost with the central bank borrowing at an overnight rate of 32 percent . 
&quot; The bids were very high . 
we didn &apos;t want to borrow at these rates , &quot; National Treasurer Caridad Valdehuesa told reporters after the auction . 
Valdehuesa expressed optimism the high rates would not last long . 
the central bank was forced to raise its key rate last week to fight speculation against the peso .
