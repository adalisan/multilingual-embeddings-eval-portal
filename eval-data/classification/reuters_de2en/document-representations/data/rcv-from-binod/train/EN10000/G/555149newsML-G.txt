Briton Colin McRae , robbed of victory by a puncture in the Catalunya rally three weeks ago , believes tyres will again be vital in the Corsica rally starting on Monday . 
&quot; It &apos;s a technical event where it &apos;s vital to have everything in balance , but it will definitely be won and lost on tyres . 
&quot; I &apos;m confident that we have a specification that will suit us well in Corsica , but the long stages will be a telling factor for everyone . 
Finland &apos;s championship leader Tommi Makinen , who secured his first tarmac victory in the Catalunya Rally , knows that a good result in the fifth round of this year &apos;s circuit , will set him up for a successful defence of his world crown . 
&quot; We have had a very good test in Corsica and I think already we have a good car for this event , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I am looking forward to it but it will be tough for us , because I don &apos;t know the stages so well . 
the Ford duo of Spaniard Carlos Sainz , who won the event in 1991 , and German Armin Schwarz are unlikely to challenge at the front after struggling on the tarmac in Catalunya . 
&quot; It has always been a tough rally physically and mechanically and although this year &apos;s route is very different from the previous rallies I &apos;ve tackled in Corsica , I &apos;m sure it will be just as demanding , &quot; explained Sainz . 
the two-wheel drive Peugeot cars of Frenchmen Francois Delecour and Gilles Panizzi could once again prove a factor after their impressive form in the Catalunya Rally , where they led for much of the opening day . 
the Corsica Rally is one of the oldest in the world rally championship and is one of the few events to have been included in the calendar since the series began in 1973 . 
it is one of the most compact events of the calendar , and this year &apos;s event will be the first in rallying history not to exceed 1,000 km and the first not to have overnight halts away from the Ajaccio base . 
this year , the rally &apos;s route will be based on three loops of the Ajaccio base .
