Britain &apos;s retailers reported a surprise slowdown in sales growth for May , a key survey showed on Thursday , and economists said this might have tipped the scales against a British interest rate rise this week . 
the Confederation of British Industry , the top employers organisation , surveyed 15,000 retail outlets and found 46 percent said sales grew faster in the year to May , while 25 percent said they fell . 
that left a positive balance of 21 percent enjoying faster sales growth -- the lowest since October 1995 . 
but the CBI emphasised that underlying growth in sales remains strong and sharp falls in footwear , furniture and carpets sales offset solid growth in all other sectors . 
&quot; The slowdown in sales growth reported in May is disappointing for retailers , &quot; said Alastair Eperon , chairman of the CBI &apos;s distributive trades survey panel . 
&quot; However , the survey indicates that underlying sales remain on a firmly upward track and retailers are optimistic about business over the short-term . 
&quot; A positive balance of 32 percent of retailers said sales growth would pick up again in June . 
nonetheless , the tail-off in activity gives more food for thought for the Bank of England &apos;s new Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) , meeting for the first time on Thursday and Friday . 
a Reuter poll of 21 economists found 12 expecting an instant quarter-point rise in base rates , now at 6.25 percent . 
&quot; The bank &apos;s MPC will , in theory , be watching the inflation outlook over the next two years ... but you can be sure that if Clarke was still Chancellor , rates would rightly be left on hold in the light of the uncertainties thrown up by this data , &quot; said Simon Briscoe , economist at Nikko Europe . 
under the previous Conservative government , Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke met Bank of England Governor Eddie George once a month to discuss rates . 
but Clarke had the final say . 
now everything has changed . 
just five days into office Gordon Brown , Clarke &apos;s successor , gave the bank operational freedom to change interest rates and set up a nine-person monetary policy committee . 
the Bank will have five members on the committee , although only four will attend and vote at the first meeting , along with two of the four outsiders elected . 
the CBI said one of the key pieces of information from its latest survey was the weakness of price pressures on the high street . 
that was more to do with retail competition than import penetration , according to Sudhir Junankar , the CBI &apos;s associate director of economic analysis . 
Darshini David , UK economist at HSBC Markets , said the findings show consumers remain price-sensitive , making it hard for retailers to increase margins . 
&quot; This survey provides a timely reminder to the Monetary Policy Committee that while consumer activity is buoyant , inflation pressures at the high street level remain subdued , &quot; she said . 
other reasons for the committee to hold off for now is that Brown will unveil his first budget on July 2 . 
Junankar said the CBI expected personal taxes to be raised by two to three billion pounds ( $ 3.3 billion to $ 4.9 billion ) to take the heat out of the domestic economy . 
in addition , Bank Governor Eddie George acknowledged on Wednesday that the strength of the pound -- up almost 20 percent since August last year -- would be a major consideration at the meeting . 
a rate rise could push the pound still higher and squeeze manufacturing -- the weakest part of the British economy -- even harder . 
the bank &apos;s last inflation report said rates would have to rise if the government &apos;s 2.5 percent inflation target was to be met .
