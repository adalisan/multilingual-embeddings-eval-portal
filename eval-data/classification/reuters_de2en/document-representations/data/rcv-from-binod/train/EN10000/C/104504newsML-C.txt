Stanhome Inc said on Wednesday it exected its third quarter fully diluted earnings would be in the range of $ 0.60 to $ 0.64 per share , largely due a poor business environment for its direct selling group . 
the gifts and collectibles marketer said it expected third quarter sales to be about $ 209 million . 
the company said its direct selling group , which operates in Europe and Latin America , would have an operating loss in the quarter and lower sales . 
the First Call mean earnings estimate for the third quarter was $ 0.73 per share . 
sales at Enesco Giftware Group , the company &apos;s largest subsidiary , increased over last year and sales at its Hamilton Direct Response Group were expected to be marginally above sales there in the same period last year . 
operating losses at Hamilton would be substantially reduced in the third quarter , the company said . 
Stanhome earned $ 0.63 per share in the third quarter 1995 and $ 0.60 per share in the second quarter 1995 .
