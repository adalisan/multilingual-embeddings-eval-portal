Georgia-Pacific Corp on Thursday said that it saw some price improvements late in the second quarter , and foresees further improvements in the second half of the year . 
earlier , the company reported net income of $ 0.30 per share for the three months ended June 30 , 1997 , compared with 1996 second-quarter income of $ 0.06 per share . 
the First Call consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts was $ 0.24 per share . 
Georgia-Pacific shares were up 1-1 / 16 to 93-3 / 8 in mid-morning New York Stock Exchange trading . 
Georgia-Pacific &apos;s pulp and paper business reported operating profits of $ 12 million for the three-month period , compared with profits of $ 33 million a year ago . 
&quot; Our second-quarter pulp and paper results , however , were impacted by lower average prices than in the first quarter as well as significant market-related and maintenance downtime that we took throughout the quarter , primarily at our pulp and containerboard operations , &quot; Georgia-Pacific said . 
&quot; These curtailments resulted in a reduction in our production from normal operating rates of approximately 50,000 tons in pulp and 100,000 tons in containerboard , &quot; the company said . 
&quot; As we move forward , we will continue to manage our supply to current demand and not build inventories at our mills . 
the company said it was disappointed with results from its building products distribution business , &quot; which remain below our expectations . 
the company said its structural panels business , led by plywood , is holding its own despite severely depressed pricing for oriented strand board .
