Vittorio Mussolini , second son of Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini , died in a Rome clinic on Thursday after a long illness , Italian media reported . 
Vittorio , 81 , the third of five children , died in the afternoon at the clinic Villa del Rosario , the Ansa newsagency said . 
no one was available at the clinic to confirm the report . 
his brother Romano said the funeral would take place on Saturday in Rome and he would be buried on Sunday in the family tomb at Predappio , near Forli in central Italy . 
Vittorio was a lieutenant in the Italian air force and fought in the skies above Spain in 1936 and in the Second World War . 
he emigrated to Argentina after the war but returned to Italy years later . 
his brother Romano is now the last of Mussolini &apos;s children left alive . 
Edda Mussolini Ciano , the eldest , died in April 1995 aged 85 . 
Edda , tragic favourite child of the Italian dictator , disavowed her father and renounced the family name after he refused to stop the execution of her husband Galeazzo Ciano by a firing squad in 1944 . 
the Mussolini name retains a high profile in Italy however . 
Vittorio &apos;s son Guido stood for parliament in general elections last year representing the neo-fascist Social Movement party , while his younger cousin Alessandra , daughter of Romano , represented the right-wing National Alliance .
