David Beckham added another spectacular goal to his collection as Manchester United beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 on Sunday to move second in the English premier league . 
London-born Beckham , who trained with Tottenham as a schoolboy , sealed spurs &apos; F.A. 
Cup exit at Old Trafford a week ago with a superb free kick and struck again 14 minutes from time from 25 metres to deny the home side a precious point . 
Beckham , set to be a crucial member of the England side in this year &apos;s World Cup qualifying campaign , had previously had a quiet afternoon in one of United &apos;s less impressive performances . 
they went ahead in the 23rd minute when Norwegian Ole Gunnar Solskjaer slid the ball home , rough justice on spurs who saw Steffen Iversen and Andy Sinton hit the United bar in quick succession . 
a headed equaliser from Rory Allen in the 44th minute set up a potentially intriguing second-half , but it took Beckham &apos;s goal to enliven a game which contained seven bookings . 
the midfielder collected the ball jiust inside the spurs &apos; half and strode forward before crashing a right-foot shot into the top corner . 
United now have 41 points , two behind Liverpool with a game in hand .
