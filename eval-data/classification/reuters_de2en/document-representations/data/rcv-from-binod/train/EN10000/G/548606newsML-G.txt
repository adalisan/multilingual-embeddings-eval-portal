Prime Minister John Major on Tuesday described as &quot; outrageous &quot; the allegations made by the opposition Labour Party about what a Conservative government would do if he wins Thursday &apos;s election . 
&quot; If the Conservative party had even remotely suggested anything as outrageous as have our political opponents I think you know precisely what would have been shouted from one end of the country to the other about negative campaigning , &quot; Major told a breakfast meeting for businessmen and party workers . 
major described Labour &apos;s allegations that the Conservatives would get rid of the welfare state as &quot; a monstrosity of a perversion . 
he said Labour claims that the Conservatives would get rid of the state pension were &quot; a contemptible smear of the sort I have rarely ever encountered before in politics . 
he said that claims that a new Conservative government would put value addex tax on food were also equally unjustified . 
labour was putting out &quot; blatant untruths day after day , not in a single speech but as part of carefully calculated campaigning .
