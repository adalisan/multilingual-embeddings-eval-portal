an FBI agent who questioned Richard Jewell about the Olympic park bombing could be suspended for allegedly violating the former suspect &apos;s constitutional rights , a newspaper reported on Saturday . 
David Tubbs , special agent in charge of the FBI &apos;s Kansas City office , faces a 15-day suspension without pay over a July 30 interview that attorneys for Jewell branded as a ruse to get their client to incriminate himself and forfeit his rights to legal counsel , according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution . 
quoting unnamed FBI sources , the newspaper said Tubbs was notified of the proposed disciplinary action late on Friday and was given 30 days to respond . 
no other agents involved in the Jewell interview were notified of pending disciplinary action . 
Jewell , who worked as a security guard at centennial Olympic Park , spent three months as the only named suspect in the July 27 bombing , which left two people dead and more than 100 wounded at a crowded outdoor concert held midway through the Summer Games . 
the 34-year-old former police officer was posted near the sound and light tower where the bomb had been placed . 
he spotted the military-style backpack that contained the 40-pound ( 18 kilogram ) device and helped clear concert-goers from the area before it detonated . 
three days later , he became a suspect . 
Jewell was never charged with any crime . 
the Justice Department publicly exonerated him of suspicion last October , after he had spent what he described as &quot; 88 days of hell &quot; being hounded by the FBI and the news media . 
hours before he was named a suspect by the Atlanta Journal on July 30 , FBI agents called him to their office on the pretext of making a training video . 
the encounter soon became an interrogation about the bombing , his attorneys maintain . 
&quot; The FBI is sworn to uphold the law , and they ought to take it much more seriously when agents intentionally violate the law , &quot; said Jewell &apos;s defence counsel , Jack Martin , who criticised the prospect of a short suspension for Tubbs . 
&quot; It sounds like the type of penalty you &apos;d give an agent for misusing a government car rather than intentionally violating the Constitution they &apos;re sworn to uphold . 
Jewell &apos;s four-member legal team , which has wrung lucrative out-of-court settlements from General Electric Co . &apos; s NBC and Time Warner Inc . &apos; s CNN , has also threatened to bring lawsuits against individual members of the federal government found guilty of violating the rights of their client .
