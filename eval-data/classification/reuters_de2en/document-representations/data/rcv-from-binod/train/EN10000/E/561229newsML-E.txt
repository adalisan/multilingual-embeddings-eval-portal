Philippine President Fidel Ramos on Monday assured investors , who were last week pulling out of the country &apos;s stock market in droves , that the economy remained on its upward path . 
&quot; Don &apos;t be tense . 
just relax ... the forecast for all of 1997 is very well on track , &quot; Ramos said in his news conference . 
the National Economic and Development Authority ( Neda ) is the agency tasked to monitor all economic indicators including the gross national product and gross domestic product which are due to be released later in the month . 
recent foreign investor share selling turned almost into a rout last week as they began to lose faith in the economy &apos;s prospects as more and more companies turned in disappointing profit figures for the first quarter of the year . 
Ramos said analysts should not just focus on net income results , because many companies have spent most of their revenues to finance their expansion programmes . 
the stock market finally ended its six days of sharp falls on plunging , rising just over five percent on Monday though traders were far from confident it marked the turnaround of the market &apos;s fortunes .
