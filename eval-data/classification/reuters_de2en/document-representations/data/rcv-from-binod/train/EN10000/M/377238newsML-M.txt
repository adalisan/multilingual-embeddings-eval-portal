the key March 10-year Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures contract recouped early losses to close at its session high on Thursday as a variety of investors placed bids in long-term cash JGBs in the afternoon . 
the late rally was mainly due to short-covering from those who had sold this morning following late Wednesday comments from a senior official of Japan &quot; s ruling Liberal Democratic Party , traders said . 
the comments implied usage of public funds to support troubled Japanese banks . 
the March contract closed up 0.17 at 126.34 with 37,146 contracts changing hands . 
the contract moved from 125.96 to 126.34 after opening at 126.01 . 
&quot; Those who had sold this morning on expectations that a rise in the stock market may dampen JGBs were burned by steady demand in cash bonds , &quot; said a dealer at a long-term credit bank &quot; s securities unit . 
fears over Japan &quot; s financial system were calmed by comments by LDP policy chief Taku Yamazaki which came after the market closed on Wednesday . 
that buoyed the Tokyo stock market today , with the Nikkei average of leading 225 issues finishing up 278.10 points or 1.51 percent at 18,688.06 . 
on Wednesday that there were a variety of public funds other than taxes which could be used to deal with Japanese banks &quot; massive bad loans . 
Yamazaki referred to Nippon Credit Bank Ltd &quot; s debentures , the market yields of which have jumped recently due to concerns about the bank &quot; s bad loan situation . 
he was quoted as saying that creditors holding NCB debentures may be protected through the use of such public funds . 
he added that there was talk that NCB should be merged with the government-run Japan Development Bank after its privatisation . 
but bank debentures reacted little , &quot; said another dealer . 
the NCB said this afternoon it would raise the coupon rate of its February five-year debentures to be issued on Friday to 2.35 percent from 2.15 percent for its January debentures . 
this will mean the spread between the coupon rate of February NCB debentures and Industrial Bank of Japan ( IBJ ) debentures will widen to 0.75 percent as the IBJ has decided to leave the rate for its February issue unchanged at 1.6 percent . 
despite the higher coupon rate , demand for new NCB debentures was expected to remain sluggish , traders said . 
corporate bonds and bank debentures with low credit ratings , demand for JGBs stayed fairly high , they said . 
&quot; Regional investors throughout the country came to buy long-term JGBs this afternoon , &quot; said the first dealer . 
their buying , including of long-call options , emerged after the yield of the key 182nd 10-year JGB rose above 2.400 percent in the morning , he added . 
the yield stood down 0.025 at 2.370 percent at 0740 GMT after rising as high as 2.420 percent by midday .
