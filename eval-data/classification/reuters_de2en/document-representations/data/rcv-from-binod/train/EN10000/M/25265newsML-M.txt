cocoa futures are likely to trade sideways in the near to medium term as the benchmark December contract attempts to recover after its recent series of sharp downward moves , technical analysts said on Friday . 
the second-month December position has staged a series of sharp dives since firming to a high of 1,056 stg on August 21 and now appears to be targeting the 965 stg spike low notched up at the end of last month . 
Elli Gifford , a technical analyst at Investment Research in Cambridge , said while December would find little real support above 965 stg , the 980 stg area could prove useful in the near term despite Thursday &apos;s session low of 977 stg . 
&quot; It is marginally oversold and I suspect the trend will be probably sideways over the medium term rather then down , &quot; she said . 
traders called the London market to open three stg lower than Thursday &apos;s close at 986 stg , which being above the session low suggests that the recent downward momentum could be easing . 
December &apos;s slow stochastic indicators are also poised to converge in oversold territory , indicating that a market reversal could be imminent . 
Gifford pegged resistance at 1,000 stg , followed by 1,010 and 1,015 stg along the line of the recent slides .
