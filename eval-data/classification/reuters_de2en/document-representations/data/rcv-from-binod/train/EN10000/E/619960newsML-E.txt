the Brazilian government will ask Congress to authorize an additional 103.3 billion real credit in the 1997 federal budget to cover debt restructuring with the states , a senior Finance Ministry official said . 
Pedro Parente , executive secretary of the Finance Ministry , said the 103.3 billion reais &quot; did not represent net expenditure by the federal government . 
&quot; At the same time we assume liabilities from the states , we get the states &apos; assets , &quot; Parente told reporters . 
the 103.3 billion reais include last week &apos;s 50 billion real refinancing deal signed by Sao Paulo state . 
in all , 20 states have so far signed protocols signalling their political will to renegotiate their debt to the federal government , which is refinancing it for 30 years at 6.0 percent interest a year , adjusted for inflation . 
in return , the states have agreed to retire up to 20 percent of their debt stock through asset sales and to carry out fiscal adjustment programs . 
the official deadline for the deals is June 30 , but Parente said the government was inclined to extend the deadline for states that have already signed protocols but are still negotiating the technical details with the National Treasury . 
of the 103.3 billion reais , 85.9 billion reais refers to debt to be assumed by the federal government and refinanced , 15.7 billion refers to servicing costs in 1997 up to the final transfer of the debt and 1.7 billion reais to servicing costs for debt already refinanced . 
Eduardo Guimaraes , head of the National Treasury , said the federal government also expected to receive 4.1 billion reais in 1997 from the states in interest payments . 
&quot; It will be used to retire debt ( of the federal government ) , &quot; he said . 
Parente said the government had debated whether or not to simply include the 1.7 billion reais in servicing costs in the 1997 budget , but had decided to include the full amount being renegotiated for reasons of &quot; transparency and safety &quot; . 
he also noted that up to 20 percent of the total would be recovered through the sale of state assets , handed over to the federal government as guarantees . 
Guimaraes said the government did not yet know what the final cost of the renegotiation would be as it depends on unknown interest rate differentials over the next 30 years .
