a Catholic family narrowly escaped injury early on Thursday when two houses and a primary school in Northern Ireland were firebombed , police said . 
the attacks occurred in Ballymena where Protestant supporters of the province &apos;s ties with Britain had been demonstrating outside a Catholic church after a Protestant &quot; Orange Order &quot; parade through a local village was stopped . 
tensions run high in the province almost a year after the guerrilla Irish Republican Army , seeking to end British rule here , called off a ceasefire and resumed bombing , largely on the mainland . 
Pro-British protestant extremists have stood by their ceasefire but a spread of violence in the province itself could wreck hopes of a return to peaceful negotiation . 
fire gutted the downstairs of a family home after a petrol bomb exploded while a couple and their two children were asleep upstairs . 
St Mary &apos;s Primary School , the scene of recent protests and an arson attack two months ago , was also forced to close after it was extensively damaged . 
&quot; It is something we had been expecting ... The atmosphere is tense and I &apos;ve always worried they &apos;d be back , &quot; school principal Martin Kearney told reporters . 
Protestant Loyalists said they planned another demonstration outside the church on Saturday . 
in a separate incident , police said a Protestant church in County Tyrone was damaged in a fire started deliberately . 
several Protestant-based organisations annually celebrate their roots in Northern Ireland by holding marches seen by Catholics as intimidation . 
the parades have been a flashpoint for violence between the mainly Protestant population and the minority Catholics .
