German shares closed largely flat on Thursday , subdued throughout the day by uncertainty surrounding the political situation in Russia . 
the DAX index of 30 leading shares closed floor dealings almost unchanged at 2,716.26 points before news came through that Russian security chief Alexander Lebed had been sacked . 
that initially pushed the IBIS DAX index of all-day computer trade off highs reached earlier in the day , but the index later recovered much of the ground lost to end 12.44 points , or 0.46 percent , higher at 2,717.50 points . 
the most obvious beneficiary of the news was the dollar , whose gains in turn encouraged export-orientated German stocks , which react positively to mark weakness . 
despite Russian political instability , dealers said the psychological and technical level of 2,700 points for the DAX was unlikely to be breached this week . 
&quot; The 2,700 level looks safe in any case , &quot; one dealer said . 
a gain of almost half a percent during early Wall Street was also supportive . 
SAP , which was rated top performing German company by a magazine on Wednesday , climbed 1.4 percent or 3.80 marks to end IBIS trade at 279 marks . 
Car-maker Volkswagen stock ended IBIS trade down 2.75 marks at 584 after a U.S. judge on Wednesday denied a motion by VW seeking to block a lawsuit filed against it by U.S. automotive giant General Motors Co . 
&quot; It has had more of an impact on sentiment than anything else . 
there has been some negativity surrounding VW shares anyway , &quot; one German automotive sector analyst said . 
but he added that if the price fell any further , many investors would see it as an opportunity to buy back VW shares . 
Daimler-Benz AG gained 1.82 marks to end computer trade at 88.95 after sources confirmed it was considering a plan for an internal &quot; merger &quot; of its Mercedes car- and truck-making unit within the Daimler parent company itself . 
the move was seen as a part of attempt by Daimler chief Juergen Schrempp to make the group &apos;s individual operating units more responsive and focussed on quality .
