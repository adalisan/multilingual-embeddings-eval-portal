guerrillas of the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) , backed by Iraqi government forces , have overrun the strategic town of Degala , the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) said on Sunday . 
officials of the KDP -- whose forces seized the main northern city of Arbil a week ago with the help of Iraqi troops -- said they were awaiting details from the area and could not immediately confirm the report . 
the village stands just outside the city of Koi Sanjak , 100 km ( 60 miles ) to the northwest of the main PUK stronghold of Sulaimaniya , its last redoubt inside Iraq . 
&quot; Iraqi troops supported by KDP tanks and artillery have taken Degala . 
word the town had fallen follows several days of fierce fighting between the rival militias , battling for control of predominantly Kurdish northern Iraq . 
rival KDP radio confirmed heavy clashes along the front , saying its forces had killed 300 PUK fighters and demanding the rest surrender . 
&quot; The objective of the attack is to break through ( PUK ) defensive lines toward the city of Koi Sanjak , home to 80,000 people , &quot; the PUK said . 
the road to Sulaimaniya would then be open . 
&quot; We call on the U.S. and its coalition partners to intervene urgently to halt the Iraqi aggression and end this onslaught against the Kurdish people , &quot; the group said . 
Iraq joined the fighting in its rebel north a week ago on the side of the KDP to kick the PUK out of the main northern Iraqi Kurdish city of Arbil . 
the two main Kurdish factions have clashed on-and-off for decades but had maintained an uneasy alliance against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . 
PUK commanders said Iraq had moved tanks into a position that would place the Kurdish faction under attack from three fronts around Sulaimaniya , 120 km ( 72 miles ) south of Arbil and the last major northern Iraqi settlement still in PUK hands . 
last week Washington retaliated for Saddam &apos;s thrust into the largely Kurdish north by sending two volleys of cruise missiles into southern Iraq .
