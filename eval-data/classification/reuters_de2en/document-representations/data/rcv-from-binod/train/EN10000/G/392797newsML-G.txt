the director of the Vienna Philharmonic said on Thursday he would rather disband Austria &apos;s most prestigious orchestra than bow to pressure to admit women . 
&quot; This is a private club and we won &apos;t have our arm twisted . 
if people keep trying to pressure us ( into admitting women ) , we &apos;ll dissolve ourselves , &quot; Werner Resel told state radio . 
he said the orchestra , which has resolutely refused to allow women to play in its ranks , had received threatening letters , mainly from the United States . 
&quot; Women in America are certainly getting their information from Austria ... This is typical Austrian masochism , &quot; Resel said . 
the Vienna Philharmonic , technically a private club , is under no obligation to vote on admitting women . 
founded in 1842 and famous for its annual New Year &apos;s concert , it starts an international tour later this month and is due to play in the United States in March . 
it has braced itself for boycotts and an onslaught of protests from U.S. women &apos;s groups . 
Austrian politicians , including Chancellor Viktor Klima , have also urged the Philharmonic to end its men-only policy and &quot; use the creative potential of the other half of humanity &quot; . 
the opposition Greens slammed Resel &apos;s comments and said the orchestra should be forced to repay government subsidies . 
&quot; The Philharmoniker has never had any qualms about taking money from women taxpayers , &quot; Greens parliamentary leader Madeleine Petrovic said . 
&quot; This men &apos;s club must have a deep-seated fear of female competition . 
the Philharmonic &apos;s sister orchestra at the State Opera has also dealt a severe blow to Resel . 
the opera orchestra , which contains many Philharmonic musicians , announced on Wednesday it would soon begin auditioning women . 
a meeting on February 27 will clear up details such as maternity payments ahead of a formal vote . 
the Philharmonic leaves on tour the following day . 
&quot; Of course we are opposed to sex discrimination , &quot; State Opera director Ioan Holender said . 
Resel remained unbowed , however . 
&quot; Under Austrian health and safety rules there could be times when the orchestra would be unable to play , &quot; he said , raising the spectre of an orchestra paralysed by mass pregnancy .
