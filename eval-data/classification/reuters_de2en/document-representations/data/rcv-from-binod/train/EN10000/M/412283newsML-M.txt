spot gold roared past $ 360 an ounce in morning trade in Hong Kong on Friday as Japanese buyers snapped up the metal and dealers juggled phone calls in busy trade as bullion rode higher on the back of a platinum rally . 
&quot; The markets are going crazy , it &apos;s Japanese buying , &quot; said a Western bullion dealer based in Hong Kong . 
Japanese traders were being lured by the unusually wide premium spread of platinum over gold , which has risen to over $ 40 an ounce , said the manager of a Chinese bank . 
platinum was trading at $ 405.00 / $ 406.00 an ounce at 1100 ( 0300 GMT ) in Hong Kong while gold was at $ 360.80 / $ 361.30 . 
&quot; Normally platinum trades at a $ 20 premium over gold , so if the two are trading on par , it &apos;s too low and if it &apos;s trading at a $ 40 premium it &apos;s too high , &quot; he said . 
&quot; So Japanese traders are establishing a spread and also are uncomfortable shorting gold , which is why they are buying . 
Hong Kong bullion traders said the gold market was rising on the coat-tails of platinum and would continue to do so at least in the short-term 
&quot; To know where gold is going , watch platinum , and platinum has gone up massively , &quot; said another Hong Kong dealer . 
some traders reported fund shortcovering and hinted that platinum markets were possibly being manipulated by a large bank and Russian players . 
&quot; I think there &apos;s a game being played in the platinum , &quot; said one trader . 
analysts have said that platinum and palladium prices could rise even further if uncertainty about supplies persists following threats of a strike at giant Russian producer Norilsk and if delayed Russia / Japan supply contract talks break down . 
Hong Kong gold was trading at $ 361.40 / 80 an ounce at 11 : 18 ( 0318 GMT ) , up from its opening at $ 360.30 / 80 . 
overnight New York spot gold ended quoted at $ 358.90 / 40 , compared with the London Thursday afternoon fix at $ 360.00 -- the highest fix since January 3 this year . 
physical demand , although still holding up , would certainly be seriously bruised if gold maintains its climb , dealers said . 
Chinese gold purchasing is expected to remain steady for the short-term , but demand in Southeast Asian markets such as Indonesia appears to be slowing , Singapore-based dealers said . 
&quot; The buying has been down to a trickle the last few days . 
we may see it slide further if prices stay at these levels , &quot; the chief precious metals dealer for a Singapore-based bank said . 
dealers said Indonesian gold buying had been undermined by the softness of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar . 
&quot; The buying dried up a bit because many people in Southeast Asia already bought what they needed . 
they will not waste their time chasing the price up , &quot; another bank dealer said . 
but dealers said robust demand could easily re-emerge if the price of gold slipped back below $ 350 an ounce . 
&quot; We &apos;re going to see buyers coming in if the price drops below $ 350 , &quot; one trader said . 
Singapore premiums were steady to slightly easier at 110-140 U.S. cents over spot London prices , but any upside movement is likely to be capped by the slowing demand , they added . 
&quot; premiums are going to hover at these levels because the stock level in Singapore of gold kilobars is still low , &quot; a bank dealer said . 
&quot; But with demand easing , we may see the premiums getting capped at these levels .
