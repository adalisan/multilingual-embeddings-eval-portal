wall Street is set to end the year with a rally in stocks unless the Democrats take control of one or both houses of Congress in which case the outlook becomes much gloomier . 
with the financial community having already more or less decided that President Bill Clinton will beat Republican challenger Bob Dole in November , attention has turned to the much more closely contested Congressional races . 
stocks will have to navigate through a sea of other potential political risks such as concern about Russian President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s health and the latest violence in the Middle East . 
analysts say that the fundamental environment for the market is still good , with interest rates relatively low and an upbeat feeling about fourth-quarter earnings . 
the Street is afraid that Democratic control of Congress would lead to more spending on social programs and less fiscal discipline . 
&quot; If Clinton wins and Dole loses not much will change because the Republican Congress will act to neutralize a social reform-minded president , &quot; said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. 
Johnson , echoing the view of many on the Street , said this precious balance would be lost if Congress slipped partially or completely back into Democratic hands . 
he predicts dire results for the economy and the market if this happened . 
&quot; The market would go down and take no prisoners , &quot; he said . 
&quot; When you have a president who is dedicated to social reform and at the same time dedicated to reducing the deficit then he will quite likely try to implement social reform through tax or regulations . 
&quot; This would be tantamount to a very significant tax increase . 
if you superimpose a tax increase and spending cuts on an economy which is already slowing it means that a recession could occur . 
some analysts date the latest leg of the bull market as having started in November 1994 , when the Republicans took control of Congress . 
wall Street is also focusing on Yeltsin &apos;s impending open heart surgery and the fallout from gun battles which raged in Jerusalem for three days before subsiding over the weekend . 
in Yeltsin &apos;s prolonged absence , Russian national security adviser Alexander Lebed and opposition communist leader Gennady Zyuganov have suggested instability and chaos could be just over the horizon . 
&quot; Part of the market &apos;s strength can be attributed to the peace didvidend . 
were Yeltsin to step down or pass away , there is a strong communist contingent waiting to seize control . 
a more militant approach towards economic policy would create tension in the markets , &quot; said Joseph Barthel , chief investment strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co . 
it would trigger a flight out of the German mark and into the Swiss Franc and U.S. dollar , Johnson said . 
the Israeli-Palestinian clashes in the West Bank , Gaza Strip and Jerusalem are a threat to the market only if violence were to spread beyond Israel &apos;s borders and bring the flow of oil into question . 
&quot; The negative impact on American markets would be felt through the mechanism of higher oil prices damaging the productive side of the economy and also raising inflation numbers , &quot; said Pierre Ellis , senior economist at Primark Decision Economic , the consulting arm of Primark Corp. 
&quot; The bond market would probably not like the idea of higher inflation . 
Barthel said market leadership in the fourth quarter would remain focused in the Nasdaq 100 index of mostly institutionally owned stocks such as Microsoft Corp , Intel Corp , and 3Com Corp. 
he also saw globally exposed companies in the fore , whether they be in the consumer goods group like Coca-Cola , Johnson &amp; Johnson and General Electric Co or capital goods names like Caterpillar Inc , United Technologies Corp or Boeing Co . 
&quot; There has been a flight to large quality institutionally owned companies whose earnings have not disappointed . 
this has not filtered down to lower price stocks , &quot; Barthel said . 
mutual fund inflows , which sent the Dow industrials to record after record earlier this year , will also be closely watched . 
according to data compiled by the Investment Company Institute , net new cash into stock mutual funds was a relatively healthy $ 17.93 billion in August following a summer slump . 
at midday on the last day of the third quarter , major indices were trading near record closing highs . 
the Dow Industrials were up about 23 points at 5896 ; the S &amp; P 500 was up three at 689 and the Nasdaq composite Index was up two at 1232 . 
the long bond was down 9 / 32 to yield 6.93 percent .
