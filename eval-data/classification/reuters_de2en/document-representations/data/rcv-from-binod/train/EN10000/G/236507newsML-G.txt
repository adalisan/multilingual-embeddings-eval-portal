internationally condemned Nigerian military ruler General Sani Abacha will receive a big credibility boost from his presence at a Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso on Thursday . 
as ruler of Africa &apos;s most populous nation and chairman of the Economic Community of West African States , Abacha wields a great deal of regional influence . 
but his government has been shunned by many Western countries for alleged human rights abuses and lack of democracy . 
the invitation to attend the summit would have come from Burkina Faso &apos;s head of state , Blaise Compaore , but is unlikely to have been made without the blessing of Paris . 
Abacha rarely leaves the security of the Nigerian capital Abuja . 
Burkina Faso television said he had his armour-plated Mercedes Benz flown into Ouagadougou for the occasion . 
he did not attend this year &apos;s Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) summit in Cameroon and his last important trip abroad was a surprise visit to the 1994 OAU summit in Tunis . 
the infantry general sat among the other guests at the summit in flowing blue robes , his trademark dark glasses concealing facial expressions . 
condemnation of his government reached a high point in November 1995 when author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority rights activists were executed for murder in spite of international appeals for clemency . 
the European Union , the United States and the Commonwealth of Briatin and its former colonies imposed limited sanctions but stopped short of a boycott of crude oil exports -- the one thing that would really hurt Nigeria . 
while diplomatic pressure has slackened , relations with traditional allies Britain and the United States are cool and Nigeria has looked away from its former friends for support . 
links between Nigeria and France were strained in the distant past by France &apos;s backing of Biafran separatists who began a civil war to secede in 1967 , and more recently by accusations that France backed its close African ally Cameroon over a border dispute with Nigeria . 
but with over 100 million people and huge oil reserves , Nigeria is one of France &apos;s biggest trade partners in Africa . 
French oil giant Elf-Aquitaine is the fourth biggest foreign company pumping Nigeria &apos;s oil , while French construction companies and several large importers also have major interests . 
since 1994 Nigeria has clashed sporadically with Cameroon for control of the Bakassi peninsula , a string of impoverished islands which may conceal significant oil wealth . 
Abacha may use the Franco-African summit as a chance to meet Cameroon &apos;s leaders and Togo &apos;s President Gnassingbe Eyadema who has tried to mediate in the dispute .
