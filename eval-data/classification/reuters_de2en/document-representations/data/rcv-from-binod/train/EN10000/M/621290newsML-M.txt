palladium was set at its highest ever level at the London morning fix on Wednesday while its sister precious metal platinum was at its highest for nine months following news of an unofficial strike at the world &apos;s largest platinum mine . 
palladium was fixed at $ 188.00 per ounce , up from $ 177.50 on Tuesday and platinum at $ 404.50 , up from $ 398.00 . 
palladium &apos;s fix was the highest recorded since official platinum and palladium twice-daily fixings began in 1989 , the year in which it achieved its previous high of $ 181.50 . 
platinum &apos;s mark matched the $ 404.50 it made on August 1 , 1996 . 
the markets began their surge on news of an unofficial strike involving about 4,600 workers -- less than a quarter of the workforce -- at South Africa &apos;s Rustenburg mine which produced 690,000 ounces of platinum in the six months to December 31 last year , about 25 percent of world supply . 
&quot; The price has more to do with the very tight physical supply in the market than the disruption at Rustenburg , &quot; one dealer said .
