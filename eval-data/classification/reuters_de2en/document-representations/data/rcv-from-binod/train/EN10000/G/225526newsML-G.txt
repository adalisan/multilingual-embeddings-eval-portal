a European security summit will launch a new round of arms control talks next week that NATO hopes will help reassure Russia as the alliance prepares to take in new members from Central and Eastern Europe . 
leaders of the 54-nation Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , meeting in Lisbon on Monday and Tuesday , will agree that fresh negotiations on cutting military hardware should start in Vienna next year . 
the aim would be to further reduce and limit numbers of tanks , aircraft , armoured vehicles and other kinds of equipment on what remains the world &apos;s most heavily-militarised continent . 
a similar agreement between NATO and the now-defunct Warsaw Pact , signed in 1990 , would be extended to other European nations and adapted so that it no longer reflected the East-West divide of the Cold War . 
&quot; This is very important to the Russians because they have been complaining that existing agreements still reflect the old situation , not the new security problems in Europe , &quot; said one Western diplomat , who asked not to be identified . 
&quot; Lisbon will start a process of adaptation which we hope will be much more to Moscow &apos;s taste . 
Russia is opposed to NATO expansion into Eastern Europe , taking in countries which were once part of the Soviet bloc . 
the 16-nation Western alliance is expected to announce at a summit next year which countries can join -- widely expected to be Poland , Hungary and the Czech republic . 
&quot; The hope is that they will be in by 1999 , so it &apos;s vital that we go some way to meeting Russian security concerns before then , using arms control as one tool , &quot; said a NATO source . 
the Lisbon summit is unlikely to provide a detailed guide to how the new arms talks should work in practice , since there are many disagreements and complex problems to be solved . 
the 1990 East-West agreement , known as the Conventional Forces in Europe ( CFE ) treaty , has led to the destruction of tens of thousands of pieces of equipment . 
but it has taken more than five years to implement because of problems thrown up by the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union . 
despite Western protestations that NATO has no aggressive intentions , Moscow has long argued that the agreement should be changed since it now faces superior alliance forces , soon to be supplemented by those from new members in Eastern Europe . 
while the original agreement will not be renegotiated , the new talks will move away from the old system of calculating military power on the basis of blocs . 
the negotiations promise to be tough . 
Russia is keen to secure agreements that would limit deployments of NATO equipment in potential new members like Poland , while most members of the alliance oppose this . 
there are also questions about how many other countries should be involved in the talks . 
diplomats say too many would make it almost impossible to reach agreement . 
many countries also still harbour resentment over a U.S.-Russian agreement earlier this year which allowed Moscow more time to comply with the original 1990 arms deal . 
Russia has signalled that it is reluctant to start fresh negotiations before the U.S. Senate has ratified that agreement . 
NATO allies Norway and Turkey and former Soviet republics like Ukraine and Azerbaijan say the deal ignored their concerns and they are likely to press hard in the next round of talks .
