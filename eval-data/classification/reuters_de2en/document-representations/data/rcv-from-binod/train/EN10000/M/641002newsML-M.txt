U.S. treasuries in London pulled back on Thursday as investors positioned against a potential surprise in Friday &apos;s payrolls data . 
traders said activity was paltry and reflected the general caution ahead of a possibly larger than expected rise in payrolls which some economists said was on the cards after recent strong data . 
&quot; The NAPM ( National Association of Purchasing Management ) employment component was very strong and the housing survey was stronger that people expected , &quot; said Michael Burke , bond strategist at Citibank in London . 
&quot; These factors make me wary that the payroll figure can be very , very big , &quot; he said . 
by 1100 GMT , the long bond was quoted at 96-17 , yielding 6.90 percent , against 96-19 in Tokyo and 96-24 New York close on Wednesday . 
the September T-bond future shed 2 / 32 at 109-31 in automated trade . 
economists polled by Reuters estimated on average that 219,000 new jobs were added in May . 
the unemployment rate will be key after a drop in April to a 24-year low of 4.9 percent . 
but Ian Morris , international economist at HSBC James Capel in London , said the payroll rise could be up to 300,000 . 
&quot; If it &apos;s anything up to 250,000 , the market can digest it . 
but anything above 250,000 will put the pressure back on the Fed again to hike interest rates in July , &quot; said Morris . 
generally softer economic data have led traders to speculate that U.S. economy could be on a slower lane after a rampant first quarter this year . 
but this week &apos;s strong figures have stripped the market of such complacency . 
Morris said the construction and manufacturing sector could also produce a bitter surprise for treasuries in the hourly earnings . 
&quot; If we get a big payroll and big wages that would be a double whammy , &quot; said Morris . 
he expected Treasury yields to rise to seven percent in the short-term .
