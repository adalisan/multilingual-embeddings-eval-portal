implied volatility rates for U.S. Treasury bond options were at contract lows at midday , a reflection of how widespread is the sentiment that Federal Reserve policymakers soon will nudge interest rates higher , analysts said . 
&quot; Today &apos;s news is a given , &quot; said Brad Tyl , analyst for Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co . &quot; The only news today is if they did nothing . 
June bond volatility at midsession was quoted at 9.2 percent , the lowest it has been since the options were listed last summer , according to Optima Investment Research . 
may volatility also was estimated at 9.2 percent . 
both were down about 0.1 point from the previous session . 
&quot; Vols have been crushed in Eurodollars , bonds and mid-curve Euros , &quot; said a bond floor trader . 
&quot; They &apos;re all unbelievably cheap . 
June bond futures were recently trading at 109-12 , up 12 / 32 , and have been wedged between the highest concentrations of open interest in options , at the 108-00 and 112-00 strikes . 
with futures priced in the middle of expectations , volatility typically trends lower , said Tyl . 
in Eurodollar options , floor analysts said market participants have been liquidating put positions , pushing volume in puts to an even ratio with volume in calls . 
the put liquidation most likely was the result of profit-taking after prices fell over the past month , said one floor analyst in Eurodollars . 
&quot; Maybe the market has priced in enough &quot; of a tightening , the analyst said . 
Eurodollar volatility levels were holding fairly steady at midsession , at 9.5 percent in June , 12.1 percent in September , 13.6 percent in December , 15.3 percent in March , 16.7 percent in June 1998 and 17.4 percent in September 1998 .
