the smallest field since 1985 will charge from the gate on Saturday for the 123rd Kentucky Derby , and the number of starters is a factor some say could put a betting favourite in the winner &apos;s circle for a change . 
a favourite hasn &apos;t won the 1 1 / 4-mile &quot; run for the Roses &quot; since spectacular Bid rallied down the long stretch to beat a 10-horse field as the 3-5 favourite . 
since then , the winner at the betting windows has been the loser on the track . 
things have gotten so tough only two favourites in that 17-year period have managed to come in second . 
horses such as Holy Bull , Chief &apos;s Crown , Hansel , Air Forbes won and Rockhill Native have finished up the track and many blame fields of 18 , 19 and 20 horses where two gates are used and the calvary charge to the first turn has ruined many chances . 
not this year as 13 horses are set to start the race . 
&quot; Everyone &apos;s in one gate and that &apos;s a huge advantage for all of us , &quot; said Frank Brothers , trainer of pulpit , the 2-1 early line favourite . 
&quot; It &apos;s a quarter-mile run to the turn so everyone should have time to get where they want to be . 
brothers trained Hansel as the 5-2 favourite in 1991 . 
the horse had a similar running style as pulpit and sat in a solid position down the backstretch , then got caught in traffic and faded to 10th . 
&quot; The Derby is a one shot deal , &quot; Brothers said . 
&quot; There &apos;s really no way you can prepare enough . 
but pulpit has all the tools to win . 
the son of A.P. 
Indy and grandson of Triple Crown-winner Seattle Slew , pulpit was unraced as a 2-year-old then won three straight in Florida before losing to Captain Bodgit in the Florida Derby . 
brothers said pulpit was off that day and got caught in a jam at the start , &quot; but he showed a lot of heart to finish second in the Florida Derby when he could have just given up . 
the horse is owned by Kentucky dynasty Claiborne Farm and will be ridden by Shane sellers in Saturday &apos;s $ 1 million race . 
the oddsmakers think Captain Bodgit , listed at 5-2 , will provide the biggest challenge for pulpit . 
he has won seven of 10 and his last win came in the Wood Memorial in New York in the kind of sloppy conditions that could be duplicated Saturday if predicted thunderstorms materialise . 
Bodgit &apos;s ownership , Team valour , is about as far away from the blue-bloods of Kentucky as can be . 
team valour is a 32-member syndicate that includes a radio talk-show host , a former member of Congress , an officer of a software company and no less than five lawyers and four retired businessmen . 
he is trained by Gary Capuano , a 33-year-old member of a Maryland racing family who is based at the training facility on the faceless grounds of the defunct Bowie race course . 
it is his first Derby and he admits to being a little awed by all the attention . 
&quot; You watch the Triple Crown races on TV as a kid and you imagine being there , looking at the twin spires , and you think you &apos;d love to be there with a horse . 
the two favourites , however , won &apos;t be alone in America &apos;s most famous race . 
if there are no last-minute scratches , 11 others will have plenty to say about the course of the race . 
the best of the rest are two California-based runners , 5-1 Silver charm and 8-1 Free House , who have battled each other at Santa Anita , with Free House winning the last two meetings . 
CONCERTO , also at 8-1 , is owned by New York Yankees principal owner George Steinbrenner , and has won seven of his last eight , but never at the Derby &apos;s Grade One level . 
Crypto Star , at 10-1 and the winner of the Arkansas Derby , is known for a come-from-behind style that would have been helped by the small field had he not drawn the No . 
1 post position . 
the rest of the field includes phantom on Tour and Hello at 12-1 , Nick Zito &apos;s entry of Shammy Davis and Jack Flash at 30-1 and Celtic warrior , Crimson classic and D. Wayne Lukas &apos;s late entry of Deeds Not Words , all at 50-1 .
