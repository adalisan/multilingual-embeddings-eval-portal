the precious metals slid closer to key price support levels on Wednesday afternoon after suffering sharp losses and dealers said they could break lower . 
&quot; We &apos;re getting to critical levels , &quot; a London-based dealer said . 
&quot; If the pressure stays on gold it &apos;ll head down to $ 375 and if silver breaks through support we &apos;ll get a sell-off . 
gold fixed at $ 379.70 per ounce compared with $ 380.30 at the morning fix and $ 381.70 on Tuesday afternoon . 
&quot; The $ 380 is a very big number for gold , &quot; one dealer said . 
earlier prices were held just above the key support level after tumbling in a New York-led sell-off on Tuesday afternoon . 
but fresh selling by the investment funds shortly after the New York COMEX futures market opened put spot gold under renewed pressure after a quiet but uneasy morning in European trade . 
&quot; Gold as an entity is not looking too well . 
there has been some quality selling -- not just speculative -- that &apos;s pushed the price down , &quot; a dealer said of the pattern so far this week . 
unconfirmed rumours of further European central bank selling of gold reserves , as European Union countries seek to meet the 1999 single-currency criteria , has been depressing market sentiment , dealers said . 
&quot; As far as the central banks are concerned , the damage has been done to ( gold ) sentiment possibly without selling an ounce , &quot; one market analyst said . 
other market sources favoured the idea that higher gold borrowing rates and the depressed outlook could have come from forward selling by a gold producer . 
there was no obvious reaction in the market to the 50-basis point rise in the UK minimum lending rate announced earlier . 
but dealers said that U.S. third quarter GDP figures released earlier had given a further lift to the bond market while offering little reason for investors to come in to gold . 
silver was holding just above its $ 4.80 support level after crumbling nearly 10 cents on Tuesday afternoon . 
it was indicated at $ 4.81 / $ 4.83 and ounce after fixing at $ 4.8260 cents , a fresh low since March 30 , 1995 . 
&quot; If gold can stabilise then there are better chances for silver to go up again , &quot; said analyst HansPeter Hausheer of Swiss Bank Corp in Zurich . 
platinum was struggling at the bottom of its recent $ 380- $ 390 price range , fixing at a fresh near-three year low of $ 380.25 an ounce and palladium was caught in a tight range of $ 115.00- $ 116.00 an ounce , little changed from its last close .
