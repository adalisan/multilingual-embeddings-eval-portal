the rand ended around a cent weaker on Monday in quiet trade as the market settled after last week &apos;s wild swings and dealers expected a consolidation phase to set in during the next few days . 
the rand ended at 4.6950 / 7000 on the dollar after a morning low of 4.7070 bid and from 4.6835 / 6985 late on Friday . 
traders said there had been little to stimulate trade after intense rumours on Friday of an announcement on foreign exchange controls and interest rates were scuppered . 
&quot; It was a quiet day marked by local and offshore buying of dollars in the morning after the guys went short late on Friday in anticipation of an announcement , &quot; a foreign trader said . 
&quot; The rand moved steadily weaker during the day but it was nothing serious . 
also , the central bank was around adding liquidity at around 4.70 , &quot; he added . 
another said the unit breached 4.70 during the morning session on dollar demand but managed to close below that level after a foreign ( dollar ) sell order hit the market in the afternoon . 
&quot; Now that it has held and closed below 4.70 we should stay in a 4.67 to 4.72 range for the next few days until reserves are released on Thursday , &quot; the dealer said . 
October gold and foreign exchange reserves are scheduled for release on Thursday at 1600 GMT . 
also due out this week is the September producer price inflation figure at 0900 GMT on Tuesday . 
economists forecast a consensus 0.9 percent month-on-month rise and a 8.2 percent year-on-year rise for September producer inflation data compared with August &apos;s 1.0 and 7.4 percent increase . 
most traders felt some consolidation was on the cards in the next few days after the rash of rumours and volatility last week . 
against the crosses , the rand was last quoted at 7.6878 / 7007 against sterling from 7.6566 / 6694 overnight and at 0.3218 / 3223 marks from 0.3242 / 3246 marks previously . 
bond market yields ended slightly higher from their previous closing levels after meeting resistance on the topside at 15.96 percent during the day . 
&quot; It looks like the market will be rangebound ahead of the options close-out and the reserves figure on Thursday , &quot; a bond trader said . 
&quot; Bonds weakened a bit during the day but it was nothing dramatic and trade was mostly jobber driven . 
we &apos;re not expecting any huge moves until the option close out ... people are holding their breath until then , &quot; he added . 
trade had been relatively thin and the market was seen taking direction from the rand on Tuesday . 
at 1411 GMT the key R150 was quoted at 15.92 percent from 15.855 percent on Friday . 
the Bond Exchange said foreigners bought a net 24.88 million rand of South African bonds on Friday after selling 216.12 million rand on Thursday . 
nominal cumulative volumes stood at 7.78 billion rand on Friday from 38.76 billion rand on Thursday -- a settlement day . 
on the money market , three-month NCD rates were slightly higher at between 16.40 to 16.50 percent offered from 16.35 and 16.50 percent previously , while the 90-day BA rate was also slightly higher at between 15.75 and 15.85 percent from 15.85 and 15.70 percent . 
the Reserve Bank indicated the daily shortage at 8.744 billion rand on Saturday from 8.809 billion rand on Friday .
