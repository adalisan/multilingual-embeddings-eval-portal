the normally sleepy Finnish stock market has seen an unprecedented rush for new issues this year , and fund and asset managers expect demand to stay brisk even as some feel issuers are getting greedy in the prices they are asking . 
as a flurry of technology-related small caps joined the bourse , all oversubscribed and investors have already reaped some big rewards . 
so far this year the Helsinki bourse has risen by over 20 percent -- about level with neighbouring Stockholm but clearly outperforming London &apos;s FTSE . 
&quot; The markets are incredibly liquid , &quot; said Petteri Karttunen , managing director of Gyllenberg Asset Management Oy . 
&quot; There &apos;s never been a situation like this in history . 
Fund managers say they still expect more companies to take advantage of globally buoyant and liquid markets : Helsinki &apos;s daily volumes are currently about double their year-ago levels . 
&quot; It &apos;s clear that there is money around , and not enough investment vehicles , &quot; said Markku Savikko , chairman of the Finnish Association of Mutual Funds . 
&quot; simply from the point of view of diversification , all newcomers are welcome . 
he expects the appetite for new issues to hold as long as stock markets remain bullish ; but other fund managers , who have been frustrated by a shortage of fresh stock , warn greedy pricing could wreck a good thing . 
&quot; The trend could end quickly for small companies if pricing policy gets too greedy , &quot; said Kai Luotonen , managing director of Erik Selin Fund Management Ltd . 
newcomers so far : industrial wiring maker PK cables Oy , aluminium parts maker Nordic Aluminium NOA1V.HE , furniture and electronics group Incap Oy . 
on the way -- with subscription halted , but shares yet to be distributed after both being more than 10 times oversubscribed -- machinery and power group Kyro Oy and warehouse truck maker Rocla Oy . 
on top of this , fresh stock has been brought to market in already listed state steel group Rautaruukki Oy and engineering group Rauma Oy , meeting strong demand . 
so far this year Finnish listed companies have raised about four billion markka of new capital through 10 equity issues and offerings , after new issues worth 4.8 billion markka last year , according to OKOBANK capital markets research . 
managers say the scramble for stock has left many Finnish funds with less than they aimed for , leaving little choice but to exaggerate their subscriptions or end up with small positions that could be unattractive to hold . 
&quot; The end result is that companies don &apos;t get the long-term owners that they &apos;ve hoped for , &quot; Karttunen said . 
&quot; For mutual funds this causes more trouble than it is worth , &quot; Savikko said . 
but some are urging a more disciplined approach to issues , voicing a hint of resentment at an increasing desire by newly listing firms to secure high overseas ownership . 
Savikko spoke of favouritism in some share distributions by lead managers . 
&quot; If ( the companies ) think its nicer to have foreign funds as owners , they shouldn &apos;t bother to offer Finnish funds even the small amounts of shares that they do , &quot; he said . 
views differ on whether the offers have been fairly priced . 
Erik Selin &apos;s Luotonen warned that even though Finland is now an issuers &apos; market , if the boom in new small cap issues continues , that market could grow volatile towards year-end . 
&quot; I &apos;m especially concerned ... that the pricing of small cap issues is too heavily based on European bluechip valuations , &quot; he said , arguing that Helsinki -- traditionally an illiquid market especially in small caps -- should be more deeply discounted . 
Luotonen also said that if Helsinki had staged some bluechip issues from names like Telecom Finland , the Helsinki telephone company HPY or Finnish state-owned power producer IVO , things would be calmer . 
&quot; They are bluechips that simply would have satisfied the market &apos;s demand , &quot; he said .
