Tokyo stocks ascended in early Tuesday morning trade , led by interest in blue-chip issues , brokers said , which were lifted by strength in U.S. markets overnight and weakness in the yen against the dollar . 
as of 0017 GMT , the Nikkei 225 was up 57.60 points or 0.28 percent at 20,632.86 . 
September Nikkei futures added 40 to 20,630 . 
&quot; The yen is at about 117 ( to the dollar ) and global issues , especially high-priced ones that have been rising lately , will probably continue to be encouraged by this ( the yen weakness ) , &quot; Sanyo Securities general manager Mitsuru Hayashino said .
