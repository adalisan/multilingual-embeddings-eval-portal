CME live cattle futures held gains late , bolstered by the strong tone to cash cattle markets while feeder cattle finished steady to lower but off the day &apos;s lows , traders said . 
live cattle closed up 0.050 to 0.275 cent per lb with June up the least at 65.225 cents as late fund rolling pared gains . 
feeder cattle ended unchanged to 0.150 cent a lb lower with August off 0.025 at 76.925 cents after setting a new high of 77.100 cent . 
live cattle moved higher , buoyed by recent gains in wholesale beef prices and this week &apos;s higher cash cattle prices . 
traders shrugged off news that beef prices slipped at midday , with USDA quoting boxed beef cut-out values down $ 0.57 to $ 0.94 per cwt after several days of gains . 
those gains pushed beef prices on Tuesday to their highest level since December 4 , 1995 . 
overhead resistance and fund rolling clipped gains late in the live cattle pit , traders said . 
start of the &quot; Goldman roll &quot; , rolling of long June positions into August by various houses for Goldman Sachs added to overhead resistance from an expected break in cash markets going into summer . 
expectations cash markets were at or approaching a near-term top kept a lid on the market , traders said . 
retailers are almost finished booking beef for Memorial Day advertisements . 
as a result , beef prices could ease and bids could be pressured for fed cattle next week or the following week , some sources said . 
Choice-type cattle sold at $ 69 per cwt Wednesday , the highest level since late February , and could reach $ 70 by next week before prices start a summer decline . 
next week Friday &apos;s Cattle-on-Feed report is expected to confirm high on-feed supplies . 
early indications on the report point to likely larger and possible record-large on-feed supplies , they said . 
no matter what the percent of placements during April , &quot; the fact remains we have a hell of an increase on feed versus a year ago , &quot; said Chuck Levitt , senior livestock analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. &quot; We are going to have increasing numbers into the summer period from the late spring . 
losses were pared late in the feeder cattle pit as corn futures set back , traders said . 
prices had been dragged down by local profit-taking early with commission house closing sell stops weighing on August late . 
this offset rolling of long May positions into August , traders said . 
although the latest CME feeder cattle index slipped , overall demand for feeders remains strong , they added . 
the latest CME feeder cattle index was off $ 0.14 to $ 73.20 per cwt . 
however , feeder cattle prices at the key Amarillo market this week were up $ 1.00 to $ 2.00 per cwt , USDA reported and at Oklahoma City , prices were firm to $ 2.00 higher . 
Refco bought August at the close . 
man and LIT division of First Options spread long August / short May and Refco spread long October / short May , pit sources added .
