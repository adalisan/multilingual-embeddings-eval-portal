a German government advisory panel suggested on Tuesday slashing top rates on income and corporate taxes to 30 percent from 53 percent , which would be lower than schemes being discussed by the government . 
over the weekend , Finance Minister Theo Waigel suggested the top tax rate could be lowered to 35 percent . 
the study said a steep reduction in tax rates was necessary to improve Germany &apos;s ability to compete internationally for foreign investment capital so &quot; jobs will be created here and not elsewhere . 
the lowest tax rate should also fall to 10 percent , the panel of 30 independent advisors said in a study presented to reporters before a news conference . 
it also called for a third tax rate , a 15-percent tax on interest earnings from savings , loans and life insurance policies . 
should the government adopt the panel &apos;s model , the study estimated Germany would lose 102 billion marks in tax revenues . 
but it said the the decline could partly be offset by cutting tax exemptions totalling 77.5 billion marks . 
the remainder should be passed on to the public as net a tax cut of 24.5 billion marks and be offset by cutting state subsidies and other forms of government spending .
