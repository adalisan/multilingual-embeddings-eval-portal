but for the spin of a coin , the tens of thousands assembled next Saturday for the world &apos;s most famous horse race would be watching the Epsom Bunbury not the Epsom Derby . 
in 1780 , two English noblemen , Lord Derby and Sir Charles Bunbury , met at the former &apos;s country house , The oaks , and decided to inaugurate a race for thoroughbreds . 
they reputedly tossed a coin to see whose name it would carry . 
Bunbury lost but made up for it by winning the first running later that year with a horse called Diomed . 
friends insisted that another race , for fillies only , should be named after Lord Derby &apos;s residence and so the Derby and oaks were born . 
down the years it was the Derby , the race for colts , which was to achieve prestige and renown though it has slipped significantly in cash terms recently as Japan , the United States and Dubai have increasingly flexed their financial muscle . 
truth to tell , in the early days the Derby hardly set the world alight . 
but from the mid 1800s onwards with the coming of the railways , an excitable sporting press and a populace with a bit of money in its pockets , Derby Day ballooned into the party now familiar to all . 
drama abounded , never more so than in 1913 when a women &apos;s rights activist threw herself in front of the English king &apos;s horse as the field galloped round Tattenham corner . 
names of great horses and jockeys echo through the ages -- from Ormonde to Nijinsky , Fred Archer to Lester Piggott . 
Piggott , now aged 61 and retired from the saddle , will be on hand again on Saturday , no doubt savouring his memories of the unique track with its wicked slopes and camber that he mastered better than all others . 
nine Derby wins , the last in 1983 on Teenoso , set a benchmark which it is difficult to see being equalled . 
whether Saturday &apos;s winner will go into racing &apos;s hall of fame remains to be seen . 
entrepreneur , winner of the 2,000 Guineas , is 4-5 favourite to capture a second classic . 
trainer Michael Stoute , forever associated with Shergar , and jockey Michael Kinane , are the men for the job . 
the noble lord and Sir Charles would have approved .
