German police detained more than 250 neo-Nazis over the weekend in a major operation to stop them holding rallies to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the death of Hitler &apos;s deputy Rudolf Hess . 
around 150 Scandinavian , Dutch and German extremists exploited more liberal freedom of speech laws in neighbouring Denmark to rally in the town of Koege on Saturday . 
many waved swastika flags , chanting &quot; Sieg Heil &quot; and &quot; Hess -- Fighter For Peace . 
neo-Nazis in Germany played cat-and-mouse with police , keeping their plans for gatherings secret in an attempt to beat widespread bans imposed on any events connected with Hess , who died on August 17 , 1987 , in Berlin &apos;s Spandau prison . 
police in the state of Thuringia said they had detained 94 people and also seized baseball bats , neo-Nazi music cassettes and propaganda material at special traffic checkpoints set up to intercept the extremists before they could gather . 
&quot; They came from all parts of Germany , &quot; Thuringia police spokesman Dietmar Kaiser said . 
&quot; This shows right-wing extremists were certainly planning a central event for all of Germany . 
police in the northern state of Lower Saxony said they believed the main rally had been planned for somewhere in their area but they had managed to stop it going ahead . 
sixty neo-Nazis were detained in Koenigslutter , northern Germany , after trying to rally outside the local cathedral . 
a police spokesman said the extremists had arrived in the city after officers ordered them to disperse when they attempted to gather in nearby Braunschweig , also in Lower Saxony . 
police there seized placards bearing an image of Hess and the words &quot; Freedom Fighter , Peace Messenger , martyr &quot; . 
judges from Germany &apos;s highest court held a special late-night session on Saturday to block a last-minute attempt to hold a rally in the small Bavarian town where Hess is buried . 
the Federal Constitutional Court rejected a challenge to a ban on gatherings connected with Hess in the town of Wunsiedel . 
police in the central state of Hesse said they had taken 89 people into custody . 
a spokesman said officers had seized knives and placards with extremist slogans . 
special information lines run by neo-Nazi groups had told members to have plenty of petrol in their cars and fresh batteries for mobile telephones so they could get to rallies without having to stop at service stations . 
but Kaiser said police had learned from previous neo-Nazi attempts to outwit them . 
&quot; I can &apos;t describe all our sources of information but we &apos;re certainly in a position to follow these attempts to cover their tracks , &quot; he told German Radio . 
the Danish rally was switched to Koege , west of Copenhagen , from the nearby town of Roskilde at the last minute to avoid battles with anti-Nazi protesters . 
some 44 protesters from both sides were arrested during the course of the day . 
&quot; We changed plans to have a peaceful demo . 
we have had that , so it was a success , &quot; Danish neo-Nazi leader Jonny Hansen said . 
in the east German city of Halle , around 40 left-wing demonstrators attacked about 50 right-wingers holding a small rally in the city centre to mark Hess &apos;s death . 
five of the left-wingers were detained over the scuffles , police said . 
police in the western town of Solingen detained 34 leftists who used the anniversary for an anti-Nazi protest . 
appointed Hitler &apos;s deputy in 1932 , Hess was effectively in charge of the Nazi party until 1941 , when he parachuted into Scotland on a bizarre mission to make peace with Britain and press for an Anglo-German alliance against the Soviet Union . 
after Hess hanged himself with an electric cord in Spandau , the date of his death became a rallying point for the radical right in Germany and other European countries . 
some neo-Nazi groups claim he was murdered by the Allies , making him a martyr to their nationalist cause . 
German police detained 160 right-wing activists on the ninth anniversary of Hess &apos;s death and hundreds of neo-Nazis battled with police in Sweden , Norway and Denmark .
