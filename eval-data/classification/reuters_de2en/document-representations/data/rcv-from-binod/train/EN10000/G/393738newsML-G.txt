Colombian police said on Friday they broke up one of the biggest counterfeiting operations in the nation &apos;s history in the northwest city of Medellin . 
&quot; This is the biggest operation ever in the fight against currency counterfeiters , &quot; National Police chief Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano told reporters . 
he said summary police searches of 10 houses in Medellin had led to the arrests of eight people involved in the manufacture of huge piles of bogus U.S. dollars , Colombian pesos , Venezuelan bolivares and Ecuadorean sucres . 
&quot; They had more than 5 billion in pesos ( about $ 5 million ) and their plan was to produce 20 billion , &quot; Serrano said . 
U.S. officials say Colombian counterfeiters are among the best anywhere in the world .
