Governor Chris Patten revealed on Monday that he has not been one of the winners , or even a player , as Hong Kong &apos;s stock market soared to record levels ahead of the British colony &apos;s return to China . 
but Patten vowed that come July 1 , the date that he is out of a job with the territory &apos;s handover to Beijing , he will be an enthusiastic investor in Hong Kong &apos;s Hang Seng index and other East Asian markets . 
asked during a business lunch what investments he planned to keep in Hong Kong when he departed , Patten replied : 
&quot; When I came to Hong Kong in 1992 I said to my bank manager -- I don &apos;t run to a fund manager or a stockbroker - you &apos;d just better make sure that I don &apos;t have anything in Hong Kong , or preferably in East Asia , because I can &apos;t be in a position where people can say there is a conflict of interest &quot; . 
Patten drew laughter at a conference organised by the Far Eastern Economic Review , when he said his self-imposed ban on Hong Kong investments had led to his money going into &quot; all sorts of interesting emerging markets . 
if Patten had invested in the Hang Seng in 1992 , the year he took over his post , he would have nearly quadrupled his money . 
at the start of 1992 , the Hang Seng stood at 4,300 points . 
on Monday , one week before Patten leaves , the index ended the day at 15,021 after earlier setting a new high of 15,322.33 .
