tens of thousands of opponents of France &apos;s far-right National Front marched through Strasbourg on Saturday as the party , describing voters for mainstream parties as cuckolds , met to plan a 1998 general election breakthrough . 
hundreds of police , backed by the Front &apos;s own burly security guards , sealed off the congress building where leader Jean-Marie Le Pen told delegates : &quot; We &apos;ll conquer power not by force but through attractive ideas . 
the Front &apos;s General Secretary Bruno Gollnisch , calling the meeting &quot; the congress of the great alternative , &quot; said in his opening speech : &quot; Let us continue on our great ascent , to the beat of the drums of those who believe they are fighting us . 
Strasbourg city hall said the march and rally was one of the biggest since the city was liberated from Nazi troops in 1944 and attracted 50,000 demonstrators from across France and various European countries . 
police put the figure at 34,000 . 
witnesses said three policemen were injured by stonethrowers who tried to march towards the congress building . 
police responded with tear gas and made seven arrests . 
one demonstrator wore the infamous yellow star which Nazis forced Jews to wear . 
others waved &quot; No Pasaran &quot; ( They will not pass ) banners of the Spanish civil war . 
Gollnisch criticised Germans who joined the march , saying : &quot; Those who call themselves our enemies ... are calling for help against the National Front -- the German reds and Greens , all the thugs from across the Rhine , international socialists like their fathers were national socialists . 
the feisty Le Pen , who won 15 percent of the vote in the 1995 presidential poll , said the political establishment was intolerant and corrupt and the French had nothing to fear but everything to hope from the Front . 
&quot; The danger does not come from the Front but from the other side , &quot; he told delegates . 
Gollnisch said : &quot; We believe that if the French people still vote for the Socialists or the ( ruling Gaullist ) RPR , it is their absolute right , as after all cuckolds have the right to be happy with their misfortunes . 
the Front was buoyed by winning power in Vitrolles in a municipal election last month and now controls four towns in southern France . 
Le Pen &apos;s deputy Bruno Megret said the three-day congress was a decisive step in the Front &apos;s march to power and he rejected Socialist and Communist charges that it was racist , anti-Semitic , xenophobic and fascist . 
&quot; Our criterion is not race . 
our criterion is nation , &quot; Megret told reporters . 
he said the congress would add a clause to the Front &apos;s statutes saying it was committed to democracy and French nationals whatever their race , origin or creed . 
the Front wants immigrants to be sent home and says French nationals should get preference in jobs and social benefits . 
many protesters arrived in chartered &quot; freedom trains &quot; , some of them delayed by bomb threats . 
front leaders advised the 2,200 delegates to remain closeted in the congress and said the authorities would responsible for any violence . 
a red flag with a swastika was briefly hoisted on the spire of the towering Gothic cathedral as local officials visited the site of a synagogue burnt down by the Nazis in World War Two . 
the anti-racist group MRAP laid a wreath at the nearby site of the Struthof Nazi concentration camp where some 25,000 died . 
protesters , &quot; mourning democracy &quot; , painted black bands on street signs and blindfolded statues in black . 
the Strasbourg march capped a groundswell of opposition to Le Pen which was fuelled by the Vitrolles election and charges that a hardline anti-immigration law pandered to him . 
but delegates sounded confident that it could ride to power on record 12.8 percent unemployment and simmering resentment at North African immigrants and political corruption . 
a survey in the weekly Le Point said the Front would win 15 percent of the vote , up from 12.5 percent in 1993 , but would remain out of parliament if the 1998 poll was held now . 
the congress is to re-elect Le Pen as president , choose a central committee and draft an election platform and campaign strategy . 
Le Pen , the party &apos;s founder , is unopposed and has refused to discuss a successor .
