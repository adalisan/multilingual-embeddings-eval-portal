activity on South African financial markets ground to a virtual standstill on Monday as many players were away for the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday and ahead of a nationwide public holiday on Tuesday . 
on the currency market , the rand ended weaker after rates initially spiked up on the back of a follow-through of dollar demand out of London which began late on Friday . 
after the intial flurry which saw the unit test an intraday worst bid of 4.5150 on the dollar , the rand settled at the 4.51 level where it languished for most of the mid-morning and afternoon session . 
&quot; The feeling is that the market has run out of steam on the downside ... 4.50 was a pivotal point and now that we have broken through that level the bias is for the rand to move higher , possibly to around the 4.54 / 55 level by the end of the week , &quot; a trader said . 
another felt &quot; the unit would not run away &quot; but definitely edge higher . 
&quot; The Reserve Bank will prevent it from running away , not by defending any levels but by providing liquidity to stem any upward run , &quot; the trader said . 
dealers said exporters were also sure to step in at around the 4.54 level , putting a lid on the upside . 
at 1412 GMT the rand was at 4.5100 / 5150 on the dollar from 4.5020 / 5070 late on Friday and a morning worst level of a 4.5150 bid . 
against the crosses , the currency was last trading at 7.0153 / 0253 against sterling from 7.0009 / 0088 overnight and at 0.3350 / 3355 marks from 0.3361 / 3365 marks previously . 
bonds nodded off shortly after the official opening after most players squared positions on Friday ahead of holidays at the start of the week and the U.S Federal Reserve &apos;s policy-setting meeting on Tuesday . 
&quot; Nothing happened today ... it was a non-event , &quot; a senior bond trader said . 
dealers said the market had already discounted the possibility of a 25 basis point hike in U.S. interest rates on Tuesday and was looking towards the release of local money supply figures on Friday for direction . 
&quot; From a technical point of view the market is still looking bullish and even a move up to 15.16 percent will not dent the positive mood , &quot; another trader said . 
U.S. treasuries opened lower in quiet trade on Monday as players were sidelined , awaiting the Fed meeting . 
the 30-year benchmark T-bond was last trading at a 7.07 percent yield . 
at 1412 GMT the key R150 stock was unchanged from 15.04 percent late on Friday . 
bond Exchange figures showed foreigners were net buyers of 100.32 million rand of South African bonds on Friday after selling 2.57 million rand on Thursday . 
nominal cumulative volumes amounted to 3.21 billion rand on Friday from 37.83 billion rand on Thursday , a settlement day . 
on the money market , three-month NCDs were steady at between 15.70 to 15.90 percent while 90-day Bas edged lower to between 15.15 to 15.30 percent from between 15.15 to 15.35 percent .
