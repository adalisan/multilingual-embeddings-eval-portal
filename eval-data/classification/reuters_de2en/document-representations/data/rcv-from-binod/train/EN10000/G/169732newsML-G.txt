Republicans on Wednesday hailed their victories to keep control of the Senate and House of Representatives despite President Bill Clinton &apos;s decisive re-election win in Tuesday &apos;s U.S. elections . 
it was the first time Republicans had won both houses of Congress for two consecutive elections in 68 years . 
they won both chambers in 1994 for the first time in 40 years . 
in the Senate , Republicans increased their current 53-47 margin by at least one by winning open seats previously held by Democrats in Alabama , Nebraska and Clinton &apos;s home state of Arkansas , where the party grabbed a Senate seat for the first time since the post-Civil War era . 
Democrats gained one Republican seat in South Dakota where three-term Sen. Larry Pressler , who chairs the Commerce committee , was defeated by Democratic Representative Tim Johnson . 
only the contest in Oregon to replace retiring Republican Mark Hatfield remained undecided among 34 Senate races . 
Republican Gordon Smith was leading Democrat Tom Bruggere but the result may not be known for several days until hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots are counted . 
&quot; I &apos;m quite pleased with the results in the Senate , &quot; Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott , a Mississippi Republican , said . 
in the House , with about a dozen races undecided , Republicans projected a loss of at least nine seats from their current 235-197 edge with one independent and two vacancies . 
three races in Texas face runoffs in December . 
&quot; We cemented our historic gains and laid the foundation for a long-term Republican majority in the House , &quot; Republican Congressional Campaign Chairman Bill Paxon told reporters . 
all but about 13 of the 73 Republican House freshmen who swept the party to victory two years ago were re-elected as were most senior incumbents in both parties . 
the new congressional lineup was expected to be a force for compromise with neither Clinton nor the Republicans able to push through controversial legislation . 
both sides overreached in the last Congress -- Clinton with his failed healthcare reform plan and the Republicans with a budget plan that led to shutdown of the government . 
Clinton said American voters had sent both parties a message to work together . 
&quot; When we join our hands ... America always wins , &quot; he said . 
Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich also sounded conciliatory , saying , &quot; I believe that we have an obligation frankly to reach out to the newly re-elected president who after all campaigned on a balanced budget and targeted tax cuts and being against drugs and being for doing virtually all the things we said we were for . 
in the Arkansas Senate race , Republican Tim Hutchinson defeated Democrat Winston Bryant for the open seat held by retiring Sen. David Pryor . 
in Alabama , Republican Jeff sessions defeated Democrat Roger Bedford to replace retiring Democrat Howell Heflin , and in Nebraska , Republican Chuck Hagel beat Democratic Gov. 
Ben Nelson for the seat of retiring Democrat James Exon . 
Democrats won hard-fought races to retain seats in Massachusetts , New Jersey , Georgia and Illinois . 
Republicans kept two open seats in Kansas , vacated by presidential candidate Bob Dole and Sen. Nancy Kassebaum and won tough races to hold Senate seats in North and South Carolina , Tennessee , Maine , Colorado , Wyoming and Idaho . 
voters re-elected two of the Senate &apos;s most prominent conservatives -- Jesse Helms of North Carolina and 93-year-old strom Thurmond of South Carolina who aims to celebrate his 100th birthday as a senator in six years . 
Thurmond , who will be 94 on Dec . 5 , fended off a challenge by Democrat Elliott Close , to head into his eighth six-year term . 
Helms defeated the black former mayor of Charlotte , Harvey Gantt , in a replay of their contest six years ago . 
their race was the most expensive Senate contest , according to the watchdog group Common Cause . 
Helms spent more than $ 19 million and Gantt more than $ 6 million . 
in Massachusetts Democratic Sen. John Kerry won a third term in a high-profile race with popular Gov. 
William Weld . 
in Illinois Representative Richard Durbin defeated Republican Al Salvi , winning the open seat vacated by Democrat Paul Simon . 
in Georgia , triple amputee Max Cleland , former head of the Veterans Administration , held the Senate seat vacated by fellow Democrat Sam Nunn , defeating Republican Guy Millner .
