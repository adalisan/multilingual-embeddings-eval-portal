Hong Kong may ride the coattails of China &apos;s economy in coming years , but the rise of rival Chinese cities and any economic downturn on the mainland could hurt the territory longer term , analysts said on Monday . 
&quot; I am not so concerned about the political situation in Hong Kong . 
I am concerned that in 10 years time there are going to be 20 cities in China which will be much more competitive than Hong Kong , &quot; Marc Faber , publisher of the gloom , boom and doom Report , told a seminar organised by the Far Eastern Economic Review magazine . 
&quot; It ( Hong Kong ) will become more and more of a Chinese city , the standard of the English language will fall whereas other cities in China will become more international , their standard of English will improve and therefore eventually Hong Kong will be not much different from other cities in China . 
Hong Kong returns to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 and prospects of further integration with China &apos;s burgeoning economy have boosted investor sentiment here , pushing the Hang Seng blue chip index to record levels . 
&quot; If the stock market reflects the state of public confidence , then Hong Kong is an extremely confident place , &quot; said Stock Exchange of Hong Kong chairman Edgar Cheng . 
&quot; I am now more confident than ever that , in our securities market , we can both maintain the key elements which have made us successful in the past and benefit from the major new business opportunities being opened to us by our return to China . 
but all the opportunities will not come Hong Kong &apos;s way , analysts said . 
&quot; In the history of China , the central government has always had the power to direct economic growth , &quot; said Faber . 
&quot; They have no interest in harming Hong Kong but they have a great interest to make Pudong a success , &quot; he said . 
Pudong is a development zone in Shanghai . 
&quot; Shanghai will become the financial capital of Asia , &quot; said Peter Churchouse , managing director at Morgan Stanley Asia . 
&quot; It &apos;s not just a matter of natural economic forces . 
it &apos;s a matter of the Chinese engineering it , &quot; he said . 
he said China was putting in the &quot; hardware &quot; -- buildings , roads and bridges . 
&quot; The next is the software and the software is going to be the most difficult . 
that &apos;s accounting standards , legal standards , the regulatory environment , convertible currency . 
&quot; You cannot have a financial centre without a freely convertible currency . 
that is not likely to occur before 2003 / 2005 , &quot; Churchouse said . 
while Hong Kong should still enjoy its role as the major financial window on China for the next eight to 10 years , analysts said the Shanghai stock exchange , in time , was likely to become China &apos;s major stock market , with market capitalisation eventually exceeding that of Hong Kong . 
the Hang Seng Index could continue to surge , reaching 26,000 to 28,000 points over the next couple of years , but the cycle was likely to come to a dramatic end , said Churchouse . 
&quot; All cycles end -- Hong Kong cycles have tended to end with a sudden bump ... 
the vision I have this time of the cycle is that it is going to be brought to an end by the next , what I like to call , stop phase of the Chinese economy , &quot; he said . 
Churchouse said &quot; go &quot; phases of the Chinese economy had typically led to excesses like inflation , speculative binges in property , land and stocks and a rise in corruption . 
&quot; I think the Hong Kong market is going to be brought to heel when the boom next gets lowered on the Chinese economy , when these sort of excesses get out of control again . 
&quot; But between now and then , the chances are that investors are in for a fun rise , and profitable rise , &quot; Churchouse added .
