Lithuanian shares dipped slightly on Thursday and dealers said the market , which previously only reacted to local developments , seemed to be responding to international equity trends . 
&quot; Global trends seem to be having an effect here , especially among foreign investors , &quot; said Tomas Andrejauskas on brokerage firm Suprema . 
&quot; We don &apos;t expect any big gains , at least for a while , &quot; said another dealer , summing up the bearish mood among market players . 
Hermis Bank was by far the most active listing in volume of 1.1 million litas and its price rose to 190.00 litas from 189.90 litas . 
the bank recently said that its 1Q profit this year was 9.3 million litas compared with 4.4 million litas for the same period last year and dealers say that it is carving a profitable niche for itself in leasing and insurance . 
Vilniaus Bank rose to 245.00 litas from 240.00 litas but its shares only turned-over 990.00 litas .
