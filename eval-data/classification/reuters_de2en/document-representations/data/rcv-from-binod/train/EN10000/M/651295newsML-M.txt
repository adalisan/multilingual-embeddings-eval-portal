world oil prices steadied on Tuesday halting a run of losses which had knocked $ 3 off a barrel of crude in three weeks . 
London July futures for benchmark North Sea Brent blend crude at 1530 GMT were trading up 21 cents at $ 17.77 a barrel . 
Brent equalled its low for the year on Monday at $ 17.54 , a price not undercut since last June . 
&quot; If ( oil markets ) manage to hold above the spring lows , we have a chance for a bounce , &quot; said Charles Gray of brokers prudential Bache . 
dealers on Tuesday were keenly awaiting latest weekly U.S. oil inventory data , due for release from the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) . 
&quot; The market &apos;s waiting for the APIs for it decides whether there &apos;s room to head south again , &quot; said a trader . 
gasoline demand in the United States so far this year has proved disappointing , allowing stocks to rebuild and putting pressure on oil prices . 
dealers said speculative investment funds stayed on the sidelines on Tuesday after baling out of oil futures wholesale last week . 
analysts say worldwide demand for crude oil , though rising strongly , has proved no match so far this year for the growth in extra supplies . 
renewal last week by the United Nations of its humanitarian oil deal with Iraq will swell supplies when exports from Baghdad resume in a few weeks . 
at lower world prices than in the first six months of the arrangement , Iraq would have to export larger volumes to meet the $ 2 billion of sales allowed under U.N. terms . 
current low oil prices come just two weeks ahead of the Organisation of the Petroleum exporting Countries &apos; ( OPEC ) summer ministerial conference . 
the cartel , widely expected to leave production quotas unchanged for the second half of the year , nevertheless continues to pump rising supplies as most members ignore their official allocations . 
estimates put OPEC output in recent months not far below 27 million barrels a day ( bpd ) nearly two million bpd in excess of its combined official ceiling .
