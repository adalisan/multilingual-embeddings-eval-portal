Russian President Boris Yeltsin expects Chinese President Jiang Zemin to visit Moscow in April for a summit that will seal a new level of relations between the two giant states , the Kremlin said on Friday . 
Yeltsin &apos;s press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing the two leaders , together with presidents of the former Soviet republics of Tajikistan , Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan would sign an accord reducing forces along their borders . 
he gave no details about the timing or extent of troop reductions . 
Yastrzhembsky said the timing of Jiang &apos;s visit was agreed during a 50-minute meeting between Yeltsin and Chinese Premier Li Peng earlier on Friday . 
&quot; Boris Nikolayevich stated that relations between Russia and China have reached a new level , &quot; the spokesman said . 
China and the former Soviet Union clashed along their border in the 1960s when the two nuclear powers were rivals for the leadership of the world communist movement . 
disputes over border demarcation were for the most part resolved in 1991 and Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin had promised to finalise the issue next year . 
Li was the first foreign visitor to see Yeltsin since his return to work on Monday , following months of illness and a heart bypass operation on November 5 . 
&quot; It is very good that , out of all states , it was a guest from China who became the first visitor , &quot; Yastrzhembsky said , adding that Russian-Chinese relations were expanding and improving at an unprecedented rate . 
Russia &apos;s desire to develop close links with China has followed NATO &apos;s plans to expand eastwards by admitting Moscow &apos;s Cold War allies in Eastern Europe as members of the alliance . 
Yastrzhembsky said that Yeltsin and Li had agreed that the future political map of the globe should be &quot; a multi-pole world which is not divided into leaders and those who are being led &quot; . 
Russia also views China as a key trading partner and both countries have shown interest in upgrading economic ties which have failed to keep pace with an improvement in political links . 
Li was also due to meet Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin later on Friday . 
they are expected to arrange to hold regular talks , putting relations on a level that Moscow now has with only the United States and France . 
Yeltsin has said more than once that he seeks a strategic partnership between Russia and China . 
but he has ruled out a revival of the close political and military alliance that had existed between Moscow and Beijing in 1950s . 
China and Russia are working on a plan to increase cross-border trade by setting up a special zone in the northeastern Chinese city of Suifenhe that would allow free movement for traders . 
the two nations are also negotiating over major deals from nuclear power plants to a natural gas pipeline , but political analysts said Li &apos;s visit was unlikely to yield a breakthrough . 
Russia has proposed building a pipeline to carry Siberian natural gas to China and is seeking a role in China &apos;s huge Three Gorges dam project . 
it is also keen to sell military and civil aircraft to China . 
first Deupty Prime Minister Alexei Bolshakov , quoted by Interfax news agency , said Russia and China planned to sign several documents during Li &apos;s visit concerning planned sales of Russia &apos;s Su-27 fighters . 
he gave no details . 
Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin and Li had agreed to aim at bringing annual trade to the volume of $ 20 billion but he gave no details . 
two-way trade was a modest $ 6.38 billion in the first nine months of this year .
