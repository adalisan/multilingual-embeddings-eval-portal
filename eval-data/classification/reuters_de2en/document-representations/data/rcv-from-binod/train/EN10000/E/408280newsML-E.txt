after two successful deals in mark and Italian lira earlier this year , bankers say Turkey may go for another Eurobond issue next month or in early April . 
&quot; The Turkish treasury should continue to borrow in the international markets to reach its 1997 borrowing target . 
it may go for another Euro deal , &quot; said a senior banker who declined to be named . 
&quot; The next issue might be in dollars , &quot; he said . 
Turkish government officials said the treasury had received new bond issue offers from international banks . 
they declined to give any further details . 
Turkey issued 300 billion lira of five-year Eurobonds earlier this month -- its first issue in the Italian currency . 
it also raised 500 million marks in January through a seven-year issue , despite concerns that Moody &apos;s could yet downgrade the country &apos;s Ba3 credit rating . 
Turkish officials say the markets have already discounted potential Moody &apos;s credit rating of one notch down and reflected it in the pricing . 
Moody &apos;s will probably bring its rating down to the S &amp; P level if it decides to cut our rating , and this will not make so much change for us , &quot; a government official told Reuters . 
&quot; But if Moody &apos;s lowers the rating below the S &amp; P level , which seems very unlikely to me , then it might be a problem , &quot; the official said . 
bankers say any bigger-than-expected downgrading by Moody &apos;s may delay Turkey &apos;s borrowing plan for the new issue . 
a senior analyst with Moody &apos;s said on Wednesday that Turkey &apos;s foreign currency rating is set for either a downgrade or confirmation in the near future . 
he said concerns about Turkey &apos;s fiscal policy in general prompted Moody &apos;s to place the country &apos;s foreign currency rating under review on January 9 . 
Turkey is planning to borrow at least $ 2 billion this year . 
the country &apos;s foreign debt stock stood at $ 78.04 billion at end-September . 
apart from the government &apos;s plan for new borrowings , some Turkish banks and companies have also stepped into the foreign loan markets . 
banking sources say private Finansbank and Garanti Bankasi are in the market to launch syndicated loans . 
Garanti is expected to launch a $ 150 million loan to help financing of a motorway project undertaken by Garanti &apos;s majority owner Dogus group . 
Garanti officials are not immediately available for confirmation . 
Finansbank launched a $ 30 million one-year syndicated loan on Thursday , bank officials said . 
Turkish cellular phone company Turkcell is also planning a $ 570 million loan to be used in its payment for licences of Global System of Mobile ( GSM ) telephone network and some other investments , officials from Cukurova group , which owns Turkcell , said . 
Cukurova group is also in the market for a $ 125 million syndicated loan , group co-ordinator Mehmet gur had told Reuters earlier this week .
