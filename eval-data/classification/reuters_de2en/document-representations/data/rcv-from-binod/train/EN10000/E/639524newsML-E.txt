the Romanian government &apos;s adoption of a portfolio investment law won wide praise on Thursday as the ticket for breaking the legal logjam which has prevented capital inflows since the fall of communism . 
&quot; It is an important move , &quot; said Marcel Cobuz , executive president of Creditanstalt Securities in Bucharest . 
&quot; Romania can now attract not only Western investors &apos; attention but also other money from the region , such as the Czech Republic or Hungary . 
the new rules , announced in a government statement on Wednesday evening , pushed up volumes on the Bucharest bourse and over-the counter markets . 
the announcement was made by Reform Minister Ulm Spineanu during an International Monetary Fund &apos;s monitoring visit and a day after the World Bank approved a $ 550 million loan package . 
Western lenders and investors had put the law at the top of a list of measures to be adopted to advance the reform programme undertaken in February by the centrist coalition government which came to power last November . 
still to be published in the form of a decree in the Official Gazette , the rules set for the first time the tax on capital gains repatriation at four percent , instead of 18 percent proposed in an initial draft . 
&quot; It ( taxation ) is more or less the same as in other countries . 
if you keep your money for more than a year it is even more friendly , &quot; said one London-based banker . 
for capital gains withdrawn in less than a year and exceeding 25 percent of the total investment , authorities will charge an extra tax of 0.1 percent per day in order to limit portfolio investors &apos; volatile movements . 
&quot; We are now trying to figure out what the 0.1 percent extra tax means , &quot; said a London analyst . 
&quot; But even with it the bill is not prohibitive . 
another London analyst said the tax rate looked attractive but wanted more details . 
&quot; How will they monitor capital gains to prevent bed and breakfast investors ? 
&quot; she said . 
capital gains are to be repatriated only in the currency in which the initial investment was made , according to the government statement . 
the invested capital is not subject to taxation if repatriated , it said . 
investors sought explanations on whether a double taxation regime would be applied or whether the new rules apply retroactively to capital inflows already on the market -- estimated at about $ 100 million over the past four months . 
&quot; There is no reference to repatriation of gains from government securities . 
I &apos;m also interested when and who will be allowed to monitor capital gains , &quot; Cobuz said . 
Romania hopes the legislation will provide a green light for major inflows after attracting only just over $ 2.3 billion in direct foreign investments in seven years of market reforms . 
currency risk and low market liquidity will remain the principal concerns of foreign investors , analysts said , but the new portfolio rules are likely to make Romania more attractive .
