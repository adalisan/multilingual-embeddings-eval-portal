the Singapore rubber market was quiet by midsession on Friday with the market waiting for leads in the afternoon session while others were still worried that Thailand may sell its excess stocks , dealers said . 
&quot; We were just sitting around this morning and waiting for leads from Japan this afternoon . 
we &apos;re also waiting for the regular buyers to ask for offers in the market , &quot; a dealer said . 
other dealers expressed lingering concern that the Thai government may eventually sell its excess stocks , which currently stand at about 70,000 tonnes . 
&quot; If they do that , it will certainly hit prices . 
although it seems unlikely for the moment , we are still watching that area closely in case they decide to do so , &quot; a trader said . 
another source of concern for the trade would be the currency problems of Southeast Asia , which has made dealers increasingly skittish about concluding any deals . 
&quot; It &apos;s difficult to do anything at the moment , &quot; one dealer said . 
at around 0445 GMT , October RSS3 was indicated at 91.00-93.00 U.S. cents a kg from 93.00 cents .
