Argentine bonds finished slightly higher Wednesday after a slow day due to the abbreviated U.S. session . 
&quot; The market was very apathetic with few active people , &quot; said a trader at an Argentine brokerage house . 
the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 rose $ 0.10 to 121.10 , while Argentina &apos;s FRB due 2005 advanced 1 / 8 to 85-6 / 8 . 
traders expected a slow session through the rest of the week with stable prices because of the absence of U.S. players as U.S. markets are closed for Thursday &apos;s holiday . 
traders said Argentine Brady bonds were supported by firm U.S. treasuries . 
however , most peso-denominated issues fell . 
the peso Bocon Proveedor 1 due 2007 slipped 15 centavos to 93.45 . 
&quot; The market needed a cleaning out , so a small decline was foreseen considering this month &apos;s gains , &quot; said an analyst . 
peso bonds have outperformed dollar ones recently . 
in the money markets , call money rates fell to 5.45 percent from 5.60 percent .
