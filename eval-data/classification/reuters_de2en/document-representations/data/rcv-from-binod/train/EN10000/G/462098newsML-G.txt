Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander downer said on Sunday that the Australian defence forces had been placed on a higher degree of readiness because of the political crisis in Papua New Guinea ( PNG ) . 
however , he again declined to comment on whether Australia would send troops to PNG as a peacekeeping force . 
&quot; We can &apos;t go into the details of private discussions that many of us have been having with senior officials and political figures in Papua New Guinea , &quot; downer said in a television interview when asked if Australian forces would be sent to PNG . 
&quot; I can really only say in relation to the Australian defence force that there has been some upgrading of its level of readiness , but that is of course just a natural precaution , an understandable precaution , for the Australian government to take , &quot; he said . 
newspapers reported that the PNG government had formally requested that Australia send troops to PNG after self-proclaimed army leader Major Walter Enuma on Saturday again ordered Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan to resign by next Tuesday . 
major Enuma said the defence forces remained loyal to sacked army commander Brigadier-General Jerry Singirok , and threatened confrontation if any attempts were made to disarm them . 
&quot; The impression I get is that General Singirok has the significant support of the Papua New Guinea defence force , &quot; downer said . 
&quot; ( But ) we have no reason to believe at this stage that General Singirok is taking a view that the constitution shouldn &apos;t be kept in place and upheld , &quot; he said . 
downer said it appeared that some calm had returned to the capital of Port Moresby after two days of street violence last week , but he said the level of background tension remained high . 
&quot; The situation on the ground in Port Moresby is , as of this morning , now fairly calm , although I make the point so that people understand very clearly the background to that is a fairly high degree of tension , &quot; he said . 
the PNG crisis began last Monday when Singirok demanded that Chan quit over his hiring of about 70 foreign mercenaries to help quell the nine-year secessionist rebellion on Bougainville Island . 
Singirok was promptly fired and replaced by Colonel Alfred Aikung . 
Singirok &apos;s supporters , led by Enuma , have demanded that the former commander be given back his job . 
Enuma said troops would return to normal duties if Singirok was reinstated or his chief of staff , Colonel Jack Tuat , was appointed acting commander .
