the North Sea crude oil market ended a quiet Monday with Brent looking to step back up to firmer levels again , traders said . 
following a deal on Friday where a cargo of August 10-12 loading Brent moved at evens with August Brent , market talk early on Monday saw sellers at August + 5 cents and buyers 10 cents lower . 
although the only Brent deal by the end of the day was at a price related to dated Brent , buyers were seen as high as August evens and at least one seller had moved his ideas to August + 10 cents . 
the cargo which moved on Monday was bought by a trader and was being reoffered , brokers said . 
market traders were agreed that Brent crude versus August would fall next week but mixed as to whether that drop would be seen by Friday . 
two or three buyers were seen looking for Brent crude to cover short positions . 
one of these was believed to be destined for Poland following their recent buy tender for an August 10-15 loading vessel . 
both Brent cargoes from the paper chains were kept before the five o &apos;clock deadline . 
the cargoes are due to load in the August 12-14 window and were kept by Esso and Koch . 
the only other physical deal reported was an August 24-26 Flotta at dated Brent -50 cents . 
on the paper market little action was seen apart from a few outright September deals . 
Intermonth spreads talked in a small range for most of the day with Sept / Oct -7 / -5 cents , Oct / Nov -12 / -10 cents and Nov / Dec -10 / -8 cents . 
similarly CFDs were lightly traded with an August 11-15 done at Sept -11 cents and unconfirmed talk of a July 28-01 deal at Sept + 8 cents . 
trade sources said on Monday that a technical problem which forced a one hour shutdown of the million barrel per day Forties pipeline could delay cargo loadings by one or two days but that the full impact of the shutdown would not be known until Tuesday .
