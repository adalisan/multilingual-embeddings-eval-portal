Austrian and Hungarian soccer officials met on Thursday to discuss their joint bid to host the 2004 European championship finals and name the stadiums for the event . 
the meeting , held in Vienna , was the first between the two neighbouring countries since the Austrian government pledged its full financial support for the project last week . 
in Austria , the venues are the Ernst Happel stadium in Vienna and stadiums in St. Poelten , Salzburg and Innsbruck which will be renovated . 
the Hungarian venues are the Nep and FTC stadiums in Budapest as well as arenas in Gyor and Szekesvehervar .
