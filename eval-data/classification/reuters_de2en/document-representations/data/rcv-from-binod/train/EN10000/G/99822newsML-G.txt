Israelis and Palestinians held intensive talks on a long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron while Israel planned to ease slightly its crippling siege on Palestinian self-rule areas . 
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met in a closed session at the Erez crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip for tough bargaining over Israeli demands for better security for 400 Jewish settlers in the heart of Hebron , a city of 100,000 Arabs . 
U.S. Special Middle East Peace Envoy Dennis Ross said in a statement the talks were &quot; serious and businesslike . 
in a sign of easing tensions , Israel &apos;s army said it would on Tuesday lift its blockade around Ramallah in the West Bank . 
in a further signal of eased Israeli-Palestinian strains , Israeli President Ezer Weizman invited Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to to visit his home in the seaside town of Caesarea on Tuesday . 
Israeli security sources said that Israel , in talks on Monday , had suggested modifications to an existing Hebron pullback plan in order to safeguard Jewish enclaves in the city but Palestinians denied any such proposals were raised . 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher , on a brief visit to Israel to reinforce Washington &apos;s efforts to get Israelis and Palestinians talking after violence that took 74 lives , urged a quick resolution to the disputed Hebron pullback . 
&quot; I think we also have an acute sense of the shortness of time and desire that we make progress as rapidly as possible , &quot; Christopher told reporters on Monday . 
the Israeli sources said Israel had proposed its forces retain control of hilltops overlooking the city centre , that Palestinian police accept limits to weapons allowed in Hebron and that buffer zones be created dividing Israeli troops from PLO police in the city , a flashpoint of violence . 
but a senior PLO official said Israeli negotiators had not proposed any changes during the U.S.-brokered talks . 
&quot; No proposals were submitted by the Israelis today . 
we discussed the general framework of the Hebron agreement , &quot; the official told Reuters . 
&quot; The Palestinians insisted on their position that no modifications or changes in the agreement would be accepted , &quot; he said . 
the PLO official said the sides were wrangling over the venue of future non-stop talks . 
&quot; Both sides are studying where the next talks will take place next week . 
the Palestinians have asked for negotiations in Egypt . 
the Israelis want them to take place in Israel , &quot; he said . 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would implement the Hebron plan agreed to by the dovish government he ousted in May but has said recent violence drove home the need to ensure the security of Jewish settlers in Hebron . 
&quot; In the framework of the understandings of the agreement , we are working -- as is our right -- to achieve the requested arrangements to anchor security and to have redeployment in Hebron in more secure conditions , &quot; Netanyahu told parliament . 
Christopher said he was reassured that Netanyahu did not want to &quot; rescind or modify &quot; the Hebron plan but said Israel and the PLO would have to take account of the recent wave of bloodshed in deciding how to carry out the redeployment . 
&quot; Within the implementation , practical questions arise and I think it &apos;s only fair to say that those practical questions now involve the recent violence , &quot; Christopher said .
