Leung Ka-ching won an appeal against the fine , arguing that he had chewed gum in court in January only because he wanted to show his respect to the court &quot; by having fresh breath &quot; . 
his gum-chewing fine was reversed . 
the appeal judge said Leung &apos;s punishment was inappropriate and that Leung had not been allowed his basic defence rights . 
the former election candidate appeared in court in January on an illegal advertising charge . 
Leung said he fought the penalty for his gum chewing on principle . 
&quot; It &apos;s not the money , &quot; said Leung , who represented himself at Tuesday &apos;s appeal . 
&quot; Everybody has $ 500 in Hong Kong . 
&quot; The magistrate was simply wasting the taxpayer &apos;s money . 
if she had asked me whether or not I wanted to plead guilty to chewing , I would have accepted her judgment , &quot; the South China Morning Post quoted him as saying .
