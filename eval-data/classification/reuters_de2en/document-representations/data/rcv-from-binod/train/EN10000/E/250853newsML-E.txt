the International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) said on Wednesday that Cambodia would soon become its newest member , paving the way for IFC financing to investors in the Southeast Asian nation . 
the IFC will initially focus its assistance on the power , construction and tourism sectors in Cambodia , said its representatives at the end a four-day mission here . 
delegates declined to estimate the amount of funding IFC would provide Cambodia , only noting it would take the form of project financing , equity investments and technical assistance . 
Rauf Diwan , IFC manager for power , said IFC was considering providing $ 50 million in financing to U.S.-based beacon Hill Associates , which plans a 60-megawatt power plant in Phnom Penh . 
in addition , IFC may help finance a large international hotel project in the northern temple town of Siem Reap , said Harold Rosen , IFC Southeast Asia manager . 
he said the IFC also plans to give technicial assistance to small- and medium-sized busiensses through its Mekong Project Development Facility , a $ 25-million , five-year programme that provides average investments of about $ 500,000 . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think we &apos;ll see a flood of investors right away ... but a couple of good projects and initiatives can build confidence and show others the way , &quot; Rosen said . 
delegates said the IFC said would launch its investment programme as soon as Cambodia completes the process of joining the organisation . 
sun Chanthol , secretary of state for the Finance Ministry , said he expected that to happen when a royal decree and formal agreement are signed by the end of the month . 
the $ 340,000 membership fee for joining the IFC will be paid for Cambodia by the Australian government , said Australian Ambassador Tony Kevin . 
the IFC , which has 170 member nations , is the largest multilateral source of loan and equity financing for private sector projects in the developing world .
