NYMEX electricity futures settled lower Thursday , erasing early gains tied to keen buying by local traders and an extended outage of the San Onofre nuclear unit 2 in southern California . 
&quot; It gave it a little bit of support , &quot; said a Houston futures trader , referring to the prolonged shutdown of the 1,070 megawatt ( MW ) San Onofre unit . 
but growing concerns over rising hydroelectric supplies and easing energy demand in the West due to mild weather overshadowed the San Onofre news . 
&quot; People were having problems buying at these levels with demand falling and so much generation , &quot; the trader said . 
late yesterday , Edison International postponed today &apos;s restart of San Onofre 2 after a small leak was discovered at a valve within an internal water cooling system . 
the operator has not provided a new restart date for the unit . 
spot power supplies in the Southwest are also expected to increase in the coming days after the 750 MW Four corners coal-fired unit in New Mexico restarts Saturday and the scheduled weekend ramping up of capacity on the AC section of the Pacific Intertie to 6,250 MW from the current 5,200 MW . 
Day-ahead firm , peak power prices at the California-Oregon Border ( COB ) fell to $ 12.00-13.25 a megawatt hour ( MWh ) , down $ 1.25-1.50 from Wednesday , while those at Palo Verde ( PV ) slipped $ 1.50-3.25 to $ 15.25-18.00 . 
April COB ended down five cents at $ 10.11 / MWh after peaking at $ 10.40 . 
April PV ended down two cents at $ 14.44 / MWh , erasing an early 40 cent gain . 
in the Northwest , low pressure systems would continue to dump rain along the coast over the next several days , with temperatures running 14 degrees above normal in the extreme southeast to about four degrees above normal in the northwest . 
in the Southwest , readings were called to average about 14 degrees above normal in the northeast as well as in the southern deserts , to about five degrees above normal in the extreme northwest . 
most market sources expect the power complex to trend lower Friday after today &apos;s session . 
&quot; The fundamentals are bearish so are the technicals , &quot; said one West paper broker .
