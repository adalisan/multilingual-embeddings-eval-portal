Sri Lankan troops began clearing northern areas on Wednesday after a huge attack by separatist Tamil guerrillas on the army &apos;s forward defences left more than 250 dead , the Defence Ministry said . 
&quot; At present , the area has stabilised completely and troops are engaged in clearing the vast area affected by the terrorist attack , &quot; a ministry statement said . 
it said more than 1,000 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) rebels took part in the pre-dawn attack on Tuesday on the army &apos;s defences at Thandikulam and Nochchimoddai , north of the government-held frontline town of Vavuniya , 220 km ( 135 miles ) north of Colombo . 
the rebels made a desperate attempt to attack the army &apos;s field headquarters and artillery gun positions at Thandikulam , the statement said . 
the attackers persisted late into Tuesday , but security forces defending positions held on , it added . 
&quot; By evening on Tuesday , the situation was brought under control completely by the troops , forcing the terrorists to withdraw northwards with their dead and wounded , &quot; it said . 
the attack , the biggest by the LTTE since security forces launched a major offensive into their northern Wanni stronghold on May 13 , left at least 58 special forces troops and 210 rebels dead , according to the Defence Ministry . 
but military officials said they had recovered 70 bodies of soldiers as of Wednesday afternoon and added that the final loss to the military could be as high as 100 dead . 
the ministry statement said 12 officers , 86 troops , and more than 300 rebels were wounded in the attack . 
an aid worker in Vavuniya told Reuters that five civilians , including a seven-year-old girl , had been killed in the fighting . 
some 35 were wounded and admitted to Vavuniya hospital , he added . 
aid workers and military officials said several soldiers and at least 13 policemen were missing after the attack . 
the casualty figures put out by the Defence Ministry conflicted with the rebels &apos; account of the attack which said the military &apos;s toll could be more than 300 . 
the rebels &apos; clandestine Voice of Tigers radio said its fighters had killed more than 300 soldiers while only 50 rebels had died during the attack , in which a military ammunition dump and a key bridge near Nochchimoddai were destroyed . 
the LTTE are fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in mainly Sinhalese Sri Lanka &apos;s north and east . 
the Defence Ministry statement said troops , realising they were outnumbered by rebels , had destroyed three artillery guns and ammunition on Tuesday to prevent them from falling into enemy hands . 
the army lost one battle tank while two more were damaged . 
a helicopter gunship was also damaged by rebel fire , it said . 
independent confirmation of events is not possible as international media has not been allowed in the war zone . 
the Defence Ministry said the rebels had tried to dislodge the army &apos;s defences in an effort to disrupt the current &quot; Jaya Sikuru &quot; or &quot; sure of Victory &quot; offensive , which has taken troops deep into the rebels &apos; Wanni stronghold . 
it said the LTTE launched the attack at Thandikulam in a bid to cut supplies to troops fighting further north . 
Deputy Defence Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte told the state-owned Daily News that troops had expected the attack . 
&quot; We were prepared . 
when they ( the rebels ) can &apos;t attack the head they attack the tail . 
even our tail is more powerful than their joint forces , &quot; Rattwatte was quoted as saying . 
the government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the 13-year-old war .
