it may be one-day-at-a-time when it comes to trying to quit smoking , but the first day is the really big one , researchers said on Sunday . 
a study of 207 people found that even one puff of a cigarette on the first day of trying to quit means that a smoker will probably return to the habit within six months . 
&quot; This finding contradicts the common idea that people can cheat , even just a little , and still quit smoking , &quot; said Eric Westman , lead author of the study from Duke University Medical Centre and the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Centre in North Carolina . 
&quot; Our findings indicate that setting a definite quit date , and sticking to it , are important for long-term success , &quot; he said . 
the study provides a valuable clue to whether nicotine patches -- which allow the absorption of nicotine through the skin and help wean smokers from cigarettes -- will work or be a waste of money , he said . 
&quot; If the smoker still craves cigarettes using a single patch after one day , a physician could suggest adding a second patch or suggest a more itensive method , &quot; Westman said . 
the study , published in the American Medical Association &apos;s Archives of Internal Medicine , found that 173 of the 207 people in the study failed in their attempt to quit , and of those 106 had smoked on the first day they tried to stop . 
but of those who had not resumed smoking six months into the study only a handful had smoked on the first day . 
that meant that if a person &apos;s chances of quitting smoking were one-in-four over six months , they were one-in-40 for those who took a puff or more on the first day out , the study said . 
&quot; Now that nicotine skin patches are available over the counter , many smokers are trying to use them to quit smoking on their own , &quot; Westman said . 
&quot; Our study shows that while nicotine patches are an effective therapy for some smokers , others may need to include counselling and other therapies as part of their quit attempt .
