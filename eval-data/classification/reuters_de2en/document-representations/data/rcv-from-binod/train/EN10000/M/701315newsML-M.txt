sterling option volatilities were little changed in late Europe , shrugging off fresh spot highs against the mark in the wake of today &apos;s UK budget . 
&quot; Sterling &apos;s come through the budget OK , but it &apos;s a continuation of the trend so vols haven &apos;t been affected too much , &quot; said an options dealer at a UK bank . 
&quot; There would have been a much bigger reaction if sterling sold off after the budget . 
a sterling dip early into the UK budget prompted a flurry of options hedging , but the pound recovered to new highs and dealers said post-budget option activity has been fairly muted . 
&quot; The activity has been mainly in spot , the options plays will probably start coming out tonight and tomorrow , &quot; said a U.S. options broker . 
sterling / mark &apos;s climb to a fresh five-year high just shy of 2.93 marks had little impact on option vols . 
one-month volatility was slightly easier at 9.15 / 9.65 percent against 9.3 / 9.7 percent pre-budget . 
the risk reversal , the difference in implied volatilities of calls relative to puts , remained skewed to sterling calls at just above par . 
however , dealers said risk reversals for optiosn with maturities of two-months or more showed a slight bias to sterling puts . 
&quot; Sterling &apos;s come up a long way , people are buying downside protection further out , &quot; said the U.S. bank broker . 
sterling / mark spot gained more than 3-1 / 2 pfennigs as concerns of draconian measures in the budget proved unfounded , keeping alive the prospect of higher interest rates in coming months . 
spot cable was higher after the budget but volatilities were subdued here , too . 
one-month volatility was trading at 7.45 / 7.75 percent against 7.3 / 7.7 percent pre-budget . 
the risk reversal stayed around par .
