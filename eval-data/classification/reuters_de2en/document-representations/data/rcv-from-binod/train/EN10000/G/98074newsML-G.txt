Burundi &apos;s military leader told the country &apos;s workers on Saturday they might have dip into their shrinking pay packets to finance the war effort against Hutu rebels . 
major Pierre Buyoya briefed Burundi &apos;s 26 trades unions and the employers &apos; federation about the critical state of the economy more than two months after regional states imposed a total trade and transport embargo . 
&quot; Please do not ask for salary increases now . 
instead , in the days to come , we may ask for your contribution to help finance the war , &quot; Buyoya told the union leaders in the Kirundi language , according to an unofficial translation . 
the economic sanctions were imposed on July 31 as punishment for the mainly Tutsi army &apos;s putsch six days earlier . 
the new regime says the embargo has cost Burundi more than $ 130 million . 
the economy , almost starved of fuel and with no revenue from blocked coffee exports , is barely working . 
but the priority for Burundi &apos;s 15 percent Tutsi minority is not to lose the guerrilla war with Hutu rebels whom the army says are infiltrating from Zaire and Tanzania . 
Buyoya told Reuters on Thursday the guerrillas could not win but diplomatic and humanitarian sources say they are keeping the army at full stretch . 
a senior diplomat put the army &apos;s strength at 28,000 after recent recruitment drives . 
Anicet Niyongabo , a leader of the 2,000-strong textile and leather workers &apos; union , said there was broad agreement with Buyoya at the meeting . 
&quot; We are conscious of the need for a contribution to the war effort . 
&quot; But the funds must be properly managed so that workers are satisfied that they will help to bring peace , &quot; Niyongabo told reporters . 
he denied the unions mainly represented urbanised Tutsis and not the majority Hutus . 
&quot; Even if Burundian society is very polarised , the embargo affects Hutus and Tutsis in the same way , &quot; he said . 
regional leaders have told Buyoya to enter unconditional negotiations with Hutu rebels if he wants the embargo lifted . 
despite the risk of dissent among Tutsi hardliners , Buyoya has agreed to such talks in principle . 
Niyongabo said the precise nature of negotiations had to be debated in advance . 
&quot; We must negotiate peace , not death , &quot; he said , reflecting Tutsi fears that the rebels will slaughter the minority if they are allowed to take control . 
civil servants have so far kept their jobs and been paid on time but lay-offs are increasing in the private sector . 
Niyongabo said at Burundi &apos;s largest textile factory , where he is one 1,200 employees , fuel shortages have led to reduced working hours and pay . 
about 400 people attended a mass on Saturday at Bujumbura &apos;s Regina Mundi cathedral in memory of Archbishop Joachim Ruhuna , Burundi &apos;s Roman Catholic primate , who was murdered with two nuns in an ambush last September 9 . 
Buyoya &apos;s government said the rebels killed Ruhuna , a Tutsi .
