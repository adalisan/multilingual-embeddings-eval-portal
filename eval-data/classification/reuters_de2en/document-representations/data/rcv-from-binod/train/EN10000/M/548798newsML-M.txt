Seoul stocks closed Tuesday a fraction lower as moves to profit from recent rises contrasted with expected foreign fund inflows , brokers said . 
a bailout package by banks helped Jinro Group shares remain strong throughout the day , they said . 
but the market shrugged off a slew of economic indicators . 
the composite stock index shed 0.11 of a point to 704.05 . 
&quot; Advanced buying by domestic institutional investors ahead of an expansion in the foreign stock holding limit seemed to end , &quot; said Lee Kyung-hoon of Ssangyong Securities . 
the foreign share limit of Korean stocks will be raised to 23 percent on Friday from 20 percent at present . 
brokers said investors differed in their views of the market direction after the ceiling expansion . 
&quot; Foreign investors are not much excited with the limit rise , &quot; said Casey Choe of Union Bank of Switzerland . 
Choe said foreign demand would selectively focus on a handful of core blue chips . 
but blue chips faced profit-taking on Tuesday . 
the weakness of the yen against the dollar and rising short-term interest rates also dented the market , brokers said . 
the 80.4 billion won rescue package to the cash-strapped Jinro Group contributed to boosting three listed affiliates of Jinro , the nation &apos;s 19st largest conglomerate . 
Jinro Ltd rose 510 won to 8,400 . 
both Jinro General Foods and Jinro Industries went limit up to 4,660 won and 4,900 won respectively . 
&quot; The impact of the emergency loans will be short-lived , &quot; Lee said . 
&quot; The amount was far short of Jinro &apos;s demand . 
brokers said processing the loans would take time as the Jinro group chairman appeared reluctant to comply with creditors &apos; demand that he issue a letter authorising banks to dispose of his family &apos;s shares in group affiliates . 
investors widely ignored signs of an improving economy in indicators released on Tuesday . 
industrial output in March rose 9.1 percent year-on-year , up from a 5.8 percent rise a year earlier . 
the current account deficit widened to $ 2.27 billion in March from $ 940.2 million a year earlier , but narrowed from February &apos;s $ 2.50 billion deficit . 
inflation , gauged on the consumer price index , rose 4.3 percent in April on the year , down from a 4.6 percent rise a year earlier . 
&quot; It &apos;s better than our expectations and signals the bottom of the economy may be reached earlier than predicted , &quot; said Lee Youn-ho , president of LG Economic Research Institute . 
but Choe said : &quot; It &apos;s not a big improvement . 
investors believe an economic turnaround will take time . 
Ssangyong Motors went limit up to 5,740 won on market talk the Ssangyong Group would restructure its business , which was denied by a group spokesman .
