on Oct . 5 , 1962 , at a time when $ 37 million had been spent to make the Elizabeth Taylor epic &quot; Cleopatra , &quot; a $ 1.1 million film slipped into movie theatres starring a little-known actor playing a British secret service agent . 
it had a villain bent on taking over the world , a hero who loved to make dry wisecracks , a tarantula and a Bikini vixen named Ursula Andress , whom Los Angeles Times critic Philip K. Schever dubbed &quot; Arsula undress . 
&quot; Dr. No &quot; ultimately raked in $ 59.6 million , made Sean Connery a major star and spawned a series that has now yielded 18 successful films featuring agent 007 . 
hoping to capitalise on the public &apos;s continuing fascination with the James Bond movies ( and coinciding with the video release of the most recent 007 adventure , &quot; GoldenEye &quot; ) , MGM interactive is putting out a two-CD-ROM reference guide , &quot; The ultimate James Bond , &quot; a computerized look at 17 of the 18 films . 
( the eighteenth , the 1983 remake of &quot; Thunderball &quot; titled &quot; Never Say Never Again , &quot; isn &apos;t included because it was released by a different studio . 
clever and colourful , &quot; The ultimate James Bond &quot; ( Windows , $ 40 ) has dossiers , still photos , sound bites , poster art , and video clips from each of the films , along with plot summaries , profiles of all the major characters , information about Bond &apos;s gadgets and cars and a 007 trivia game . 
there are behind-the-scenes photos to go along with each film and a delightful sequence with &quot; Q &quot; when it &apos;s time to quit . 
this is the CD-ROM equivalent of a coffee table book . 
you can browse the sections on allies , people behind the scenes , Bond women -- with memorable names like plenty O &apos;Toole , Dr. holly Goodhead and pussy galore -- and villains , like Xenia Onatopp , who could make a Thigh Master scream for mercy . 
it boasts 55 minutes of video clips , but that only averages out to three minutes a movie and it makes you hungry for more . 
I also longed for more behind-the-scenes photos ; there were no more than a dozen for each film . 
some of the operational elements of the game aren &apos;t exactly up to Q &apos;s ( the designer of all of Bond &apos;s equipment ) standards . 
I got occasional error messages , although not enough to discourage fans from buying the CD-ROM . 
too much disk-switching is required to take advantage of the interconnected files , the redundant music can become annoying , when you enlarge some of the still photographs they &apos;re mostly blurs , and you can &apos;t pause some of the videos ( unless you open them separately using your computer &apos;s own video player ) . 
someday , the technology will allow all the 007 movies to be released on individual CD-ROMs , complete with lots of still photos , a copy of the script , production notes , actor profiles , movie trailers , the invariable TV show about the making of the film and enough outtakes to satisfy any fan . 
but until then , 007 fans will have to be satisfied with &quot; The ultimate James Bond . 
it &apos;s rated for ages 13 and older for the realistic violence and mature sexual themes . 
first there was the computerized dog , an on-screen pet you could feed , groom , train and play with . 
it offered some of the fun of owning a dog without the threat of a mess . 
a similar product came out several months later for cat lovers . 
now , for those who think a Tyrannosaurus Rex would be a cuddly creature to have around , comes &quot; Your interactive Pet dinosaur &quot; ( Viacom New Media , Windows95 , $ 20 ) . 
after you &apos;ve hatched your baby dinosaur from its egg ( by dropping it on the ground a few times ) , you can groom it with a sponge , feed it ( the little guy swallows a steak twice his size in a split second ) , enjoy its frequent belching , whack it with a rolled up newspaper if it misbehaves , and even teach it to dance , stomp on toy Land Rovers or chase soap bubbles . 
there are five places to take your dinosaur ( I named my Gumby ) , including a jungle , forest , desert , a cave where it can use its tail to colour pictures , and another cave where it can make music by roaring ( or burping ) on pitch . 
this is a game best left to children , who don &apos;t yet understand that when a real T. Rex grows up , he &apos;s likely to regard you with the same affection I feel for one of those scallops-wrapped-in-bacon appetisers at a holiday party . 
with the Christmas season winding up , the flood of new software has dropped to a trickle . 
some last-minute additions to store shelves : 
&quot; Fisher-Price parenting Guide &quot; ( Mattel Media , Windows , $ 30 ) claims to cover everything from preparing for a baby &apos;s arrival , to the four-year-old checkup . 
it also looks at how to take your baby anywhere and how to get a youngster to eat something besides peanut butter and jelly . 
&quot; drowned God &quot; ( inScape , Windows , $ 45 ) takes every crackpot concept , from the Philadelphia experiment to numerology , and weaves it into a grand conspiracy that encompasses ancient astronauts , the Bermuda Triangle and the Kennedy assassination . 
&quot; Noir &quot; ( Cyberdreams , Windows , $ 43 ) is a detective thriller based in 1940 Los Angeles . 
filmed in black and white , it gives you six cases to solve as you try to track down missing gumshoe Jack Slayton . 
it &apos;s for ages 13 and up .
