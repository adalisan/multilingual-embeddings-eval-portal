the Liverpool house where Beatle Paul McCartney wrote his first songs and where the &quot; FAB Four &quot; practised is to be restored to 1960s style and opened to the public . 
the National Trust , which in 1995 bought the terraced house where McCartney lived from the age of 13 until the Beatles became famous , said on Wednesday it had received a 47,500 pound ( $ 77,700 ) grant from Britain &apos;s national lottery fund to turn the house into a mini-museum . 
&quot; The history of 20 Forthlin Road has had a tremendous impact on 20th century popular culture , &quot; said National Trust spokesman Peter Nixon . 
&quot; The grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund has ensured that the house can open to the public in 1998 and that visitors can share in the significance of this exciting time in the history of popular music . 
the National Trust is to use photographs taken by McCartney &apos;s family at the time to recreate the decor of the 1955-1964 period . 
the low cost rented house will have the original doors put back and a 1950s fireplace restored . 
opening times , however , will be restricted to 127 days a year and amplified music has been banned .
