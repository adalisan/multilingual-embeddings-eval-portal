German and French shares hit record highs on Monday , bolstered by Wall Street &apos;s fourth high of the year on Friday and a rebound in Tokyo . 
Tokyo shares staged a 4.75 percent leap following a torrid few days last week , while London stocks joined Europe &apos;s other major markets with strong early gains . 
on foreign exchange markets , the dollar maintained its firm tone after the rally in Tokyo stocks lent some support . 
the recovery in Tokyo &apos;s Nikkei 225 index helped stem worries that Japanese financial institutions could be forced to liquidate overseas bond and equity holdings to boost their capital ratios . 
wall Street &apos;s rebound to a record close on Friday provided the major impetus needed to push the Paris bourse to a trading record of 2,370.87 on the CAC-40 index . 
this surpassed the previous trading peak of 2,360.98 set in February 1994 and underlined the recent strength of the French market , which has lagged its main European rivals for more than a year . 
although the market later slipped back off its highs , the blue chip CAC-40 index was still up more than 1.6 percent at 2,366.41 at 1235 GMT . 
&quot; The bourse is swept up by Wall Street , by the bond markets and by expectations of higher corporate results in France for 1997 , &quot; said Jean-Pierre Filbien , director of sales at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Paris . 
however , Pierre Amancic of IFF Bourse said he saw a risk of an abrupt correction after such a rapid rise . 
&quot; The indicators are signalling that the market is overbought . 
there &apos;s a risk of a violent retracement that could take us back as far as 2,200 points . 
among the biggest gainers was luxury goods group LVMH , which hit a high of 1,442 francs before slipping back to 1,439 for a rise on the day of 2.2 percent . 
the company announced on Saturday it had completed the acquisition of duty free chain DFS . 
carmaker Renault rose more than four percent to 112.9 francs after chairman Louis Schweitzer told the newspaper Figaro he expected the car operation to show a bigger loss in 1996 but aimed to break even in 1997 . 
German shares also opened bourse trade at record highs before a technical problem in electronic trading brought price setting to a halt during the morning . 
normal trading resumed later . 
the Frankfurt market gained strength from Wall Street , the dollar and the German debt market . 
dealers said that provided there were no shocks in U.S. comsumer price data on Tuesday , the 30-share DAX index could test 3,000 points . 
the DAX touched a record of 2,958.38 after the IBIS-DAX also struck a new high in pre-bourse electronic trade . 
the DAX later slipped slightly to 2,954.91 for a net gain of 21 points . 
Deutsche Telekom underperformed the market as initial analyst stock recommendations began to emerge . 
the stocks was off slightly at 30.50 marks . 
London stocks rose sharply , like the rest of Europe taking their lead from Wall Street but also boosted by a benign UK producer price ( PPI ) report that was seen making an imminent interest rate rise less likely . 
gaining stocks were in a five-to-one majority , with banking and insurance stocks leading the advance . 
&quot; The markets seem to have gone haywire , &quot; said the head of equity sales at one top investment bank . 
&quot; Whether this is the final topside blow-off we &apos;ve been expecting I don &apos;t know . 
British government bonds were strong in the wake of the PPI report , but sterling softened as interest rate fears subsided . 
foreign exchange analysts said the dollar outlook remained bullish , testing session highs against the mark and yen , although it remained just shy of Friday &apos;s peaks . 
&quot; The widening U.S.-German 10-year yield spread is providing a high return over Germany , leaving the dollar with pretty decent support , &quot; said Tony Norfield , treasury economist at ABN AMRO in London . 
the dollar was trading at 116.51 yen and 1.5873 marks compared with 115.96 and 1.5855 late in Europe on Friday . 
gold fixed at $ 359.60 against $ 358.25 on Friday . 
silver was unchanged at $ 4.77 .
