frustrated trade sellers knocked London cocoa futures to new lows in a late bout of selling on Wednesday but prices rebounded at the close . 
the benchmark spot March contract set a low of 875 stg a tonne in late dealings but recovered to 878 stg by the finish with the day &apos;s losses totalling 10 stg . 
the technical picture was confusing . 
on first-month continuation basis the market stood above the December low of 838 stg . 
but December slipped off the board last week , hiding the fact that on second-month continuation basis , March , which still commands the biggest open interest levels , reached a 17-month low . 
&quot; It all looks a bit sloppy , &quot; said one trader . 
the day &apos;s slide , which was initiated by a wave of sales linked to Ivory Coast , gave fresh credibility to bearish views , but the market held above a crucial gap between 890 and 898 stg on second-month continuation basis . 
may closed at 900 stg , down eight stg on the day . 
volume totalled 7,612 lots , including 1,000 lots crossed on Sept / Sept at 63 stg by SFH , traders said . 
switches were also active with March / May trading at an unchanged 20 stg . 
London &apos;s inability to clear initial resistance at 903 basis March and sterling &apos;s strength on talk that UK interest rates may need a fresh hike to tame inflationary pressures has kept cocoa under pressure this week . 
a disappointing Dutch fourth quarter grind also added to market jitters . 
players kept a watchful eye on possible moves by a trading house which is believed to hold a large physical cocoa position delivered to it in September and a short position in futures . 
some traders said the market &apos;s downtrend could force the trader to liquidate its position , a situation European industry buyers are keen to see , but others said a large deficit situation that may occur this year could strengthen the trader &apos;s hand .
