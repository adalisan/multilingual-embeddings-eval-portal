major U.S. stock index options trading was relatively quiet Wednesday as the market struggled with early gains only to move lower in afternoon action . 
&quot; We &apos;ve done hardly any index stuff in the last few days , &quot; one options trader said . 
&quot; Our index business has really dried up . 
in the OEX , where the majority of index options trade , the busiest issue was the June 820 put , which traded 2,945 contracts . 
the June 830 put traded about 2,700 . 
on the call side , the most active OEX options included the June 830 , with turnover of 2,330 and the June 840 , with volume of about 2,050 . 
jerry Hegarty , an analyst at Thomson Financial Services , said he was expecting the market to head lower because of heavy equity call buying . 
&quot; Equity call buying continues to overwhelm the public &apos;s interest in equity puts , &quot; he said in an afternoon report . 
&quot; Eventually--soon--this investor enthusiasm will lead to lower prices , &quot; he said . 
traders generally watch equity put / call volumes more closely as a sentiment indicator because index figures can be distorted by heavy arbitrage and big institutional use . 
one options trader said further losses in stocks would be linked to action in bonds . 
&quot; If the bond market continues to slide , you &apos;ll probably see some asset allocation going into bonds , &quot; out of stocks , he said . 
as bond prices fall , yields rise , making them more attractive to some investors . 
stocks powered higher earlier in the week despite weak bonds as strength in technology stocks boosted the broad market . 
but that strength was largely absent Wednesday , with the Nasdaq composite index .IXIC losting 3.63 to 1,405.58 after closing at a record high on Tuesday . 
the action in technology stocks appeared to boost interest in options on the Morgan Stanley high tech index .MSH , which trade on the American Stock Exchange . 
the MSH June 425 call traded 1,900 contracts and the July 445 call traded 3,650 . 
&quot; It looked like some kind of spread , &quot; one trader said . 
another trader said some of his customers had been inquiring about options on the Morgan Stanley multinational index .NFT as a substitute for the OEX because premium levels are lower on an absolute price basis .
