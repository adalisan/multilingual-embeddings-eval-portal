Turkish state minister Ufuk Soylemez said on Tuesday the Treasury was working to introduce a new domestic borrowing instrument in 1997 with a return covering inflation plus risk premium . 
&quot; After foreign currency-indexed borrowing made with Turkish banks , we will now try a new , inflation plus risk premium-indexed domestic borrowing , &quot; Soylemez told reporters after an economy meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller . 
&quot; The risk premium will be determined depending on demand and supply in the market , &quot; he added . 
Turkey &apos;s year-on-year wholesale inflation was 85.7 percent in November . 
Soylemez said the new instrument would be introduced in 1997 after the Treasury completed its studies , adding that they emphasized the diversification of financial market instruments . 
Turkey introduced foreign currency-indexed bonds to Turkish banks in September and has sold $ 2 billion worth of dollar- and mark-denominated bonds since then to lessen the burden of Turkish lira domestic debt and extend borrowing maturities .
