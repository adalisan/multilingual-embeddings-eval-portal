a Beirut court sentenced former Christian militia chief Samir Geagea to death on Friday for the attempted murder of a government minister but immediately commuted the sentence to life imprisonment . 
the court ruled that Geagea ordered the attempted assassination in 1991 of Michel al-Murr , who was then defence minister and is currently interior minister and deputy prime minister . 
Murr narrowly escaped death in the car bomb attack that took place north of Beirut . 
the life sentence is the third that Geagea has been handed by the Lebanese courts in a series of trial since 1994 . 
he has already been found guilty in the 1991 murders of Christian politican Dany Chamoun and his family and the killing in the same year of Dr Antoine Zayek , one of the founders of the Lebanese Forces ( LF ) militia which Geagea headed . 
Geagea , who is also serving a 10-year sentence for his role as LF leader , is awaiting trial for the murder of prime minister Rashid Karami who died in 1987 when his helicopter was blown up by a remote-controlled bomb .
