plagued by a fragile currency and shaky banks Bulgarians have sought government treasury paper with yields as high as 450 percent , doubling sales in the last week . 
&quot; Record-high yields have made treasury paper a safe alternative for savings . 
investment by companies and individuals have doubled , &quot; said a Finance Ministry official , who declined to be identified . 
last Monday the Bulgarian National Bank ( BNB ) hiked the interest rate to an all-time high of 300 percent in a bid to curb inflation and support the Lev . 
the new yields , effective since last Tuesday , vary from 300 percent on three-month T-bills to 343 percent on six-month T-bills and 450 percent on one-year T-bills . 
the Finance Ministry sold 56.049 million levs worth of three-month T-bills last week , after 25.084 million levs in the previous week , figures showed . 
sales of six-month T-bills to individuals almost doubled to 23.194 million levs last week from 12.129 million levs in the week before . 
another 502.960 million levs worth of one-year T-bills were placed last week against 201.585 million levs in the week to September 20 , Finance ministry said . 
the Lev , supported by declining dollar demand on the local interbank market , firmed Tuesday to 225 to the dollar from 231 on Monday . 
analysts predicted that the effect of the high rate will be shortlived and that the Lev &apos;s decline would continue . 
the majority of Bulgarians still prefer to convert their savings into dollars .
