the following is an excerpt from a pre-budget analysis by securities firm ICICI Securities and Finance Company Ltd ( I-Sec ) . 
I-Sec forecasts higher excise for diesel cars and luxury cars , a marginal reduction in customs for capital goods , and cuts in customs duties for soda and caustic soda and polymers . 
excise duty on cement is currently at 350 rupees per tonne , among the few items on which duty is levied on a specific and not on an ad valorem basis . 
the excise duty was last raised from 330 rupees per tonne in the 1995 / 96 budget with MODVAT credit extended to the packaging materials used for packing of cement . 
therefore , the net excise duty payable remained unaltered . 
on an ad valorem basis , the excise duty on cement works out to 16-17 percent as compared to the 20 percent suggested by the Chelliah Committee . 
while this leaves some room for increasing excise duties , we do not expect such an increase because of the severe oversupply and cost hikes being faced by the industry . 
we , therefore , expect excise duties to remain at existing levels . 
in the Union Budget of 1996 / 97 , the customs duty on non-coking coal was reduced from 35 to 22 percent . 
the cement industry is clamouring for a further reduction to 15 percent . 
although the Chelliah Committee recommends an import duty of 10 percent , we view a duty reduction in this budget unlikely , as it will weaken the competitiveness of the domestic coal industry , especially for coast based users and undermine the recent deregulation . 
there are reports the government will hike the excise duty on luxury and diesel passenger cars by 10 percent . 
we believe such an increase is likely as the revenue implication is significant at 3-4 billion rupees . 
in the 1996 / 97 budget , the government had rationalised the excise duties on the automobile industry based on the number of passengers that a vehicle carries . 
the duty on vehicles carrying less than six passengers is currently at 40 percent . 
we expect this to be increased to 50 percent for diesel cars and also for cars above a certain engine capacity ( probably 1,200-1,300 cc , or &quot; luxury cars &quot; ) . 
excise duty hikes on diesel cars are justified by the pricing subsidy that diesel consumption enjoys vis-a-vis petrol . 
excise duty hikes on luxury cars can be easily implemented as it is a luxury item and will not draw much flak . 
we do not expect any other changes in excise duties in the 1997 / 98 budget . 
the excise duty hikes , if implemented , will be reminiscent of the 1990 / 91 and 1991 / 92 budgets when the government increased the excise duty on passenger cars only to aggravate the recession the industry was facing . 
we believe the above excise duty hikes could worsen the already sluggish growth in the automobile industry , especially for luxury cars . 
in the first nine months of fiscal 1997 , volume growth has been only one percent in the luxury car segment . 
growth could move into negative territory if excise duties are hiked . 
companies that would be affected include TELCO ( for its diesel cars , the Sierra and the Estate ) , Mahindra Ford India Limited ( for its Escort model whose diesel version is performing satisfactorily ) , General Motors India Limited ( for its Astra model ) , DCM Daewoo Motors Limited ( for its Cielo model ) , Premier , and Maruti Udyog Limited ( for its esteem model ) . 
currently , auto components attract an import duty of 50 percent , while SKD / CKD kits and fully finished cars attract an import duty of 110 percent ( including countervailing duty ) . 
with several foreign majors entering the Indian car market and opting for the CKD / SKD route , clear guidelines on this subject will be welcomed . 
we expect a five percent reduction in import duties on CR coils and Steel Sheets . 
with import content of auto majors very low at 5-10 percent , we expect the duty reduction to have only 0.5-1 percent positive impact on EPS . 
rationalisation of duty structure is expected with maximum reduction of 2.5-5 percent in some categories . 
duties have already come down from 50-80 percent levels to 10-30 percent since 1992 / 93 . 
in the 1996 Budget , there were major duty cuts announced for the steel sector . 
this , in addition to the general weakness in international prices of flats and dumping from the CIS and other countries forced domestic producers to offer discounts on their products . 
the producers are not able to pass on the increase in input costs on account of lower offtake . 
the scheduled price hike in January in prices of steel products by sail and other steel majors did not materialise . 
producers rationalised prices with small increases in some categories and reduction in others . 
various sections of the industry have been demanding rationalisation of duty structure . 
domestic steel majors are demanding imposition of anti-dumping duties on CIS imports . 
HR producers are demanding reduction of excise duties in view of increased supply situation and a general slump in prices . 
sponge iron producers are demanding an increase in import duties on scrap . 
Ferro alloy manufacturers are demanding a reduction in excise duties . 
for others , the existing customs duty levels are very close to these recommended by the Chelliah Committee . 
we therefore do not expect any major changes . 
import duty on scrap might be increased to 7.5 percent from current 5 percent levels . 
excise duties , which are at 15 percent levels for most steel items might be reduced by 2.5 percent for bar and rods and HR to boost demand . 
otherwise the Chelliah Committee recommends a excise of 15 percent on iron and steel products . 
for joint ventures and foreign direct investment in the sector , approvals up to 51 percent is on an automatic basis beyond which proposals are cleared on a case-to-case basis by the FIPB , ECB proceeds are supposed to be used only for foreign currency expenditure . 
steel majors have asked the ministry to allow more financing through the ECB route . 
given the capital intensive nature of the industry , there could be a case for granting incentives for investment . 
this could be in the form of : 
* * Reducing the average tenor for foreign currency 
borrowings . 
we do not expect any change in the duty structure . 
customs duty on aluminium products have been reduced successively from 70-85 percent in 1994 to 10-25 percent in 1996 . 
Indian producers have been able to sustain these duty cuts and have managed to improve on their EBITDA margins . 
with international prices being at low levels of $ 1350- $ 1550 per tonne , the domestic manufacturers are being forced to offer price discounts on their products . 
the Chelliah Committee recommendations on import and excise duty have already been implemented and in some cases such as aluminium ingots the rates are already lower . 
Chelliah Committee recommends import duty on aluminium ingots at 15 percent whereas it was reduced to 10 percent in 1995 . 
consequently we do not expect any further change in the duty structure . 
since 1991 , when the economic liberalisation process was initiated , the capital goods sector has witnessed a steady decline in the level of protection against imports . 
in 1992 , import tariffs were as high at 85 percent ( maximum ) for general machinery and 55 percent ( maximum ) for project imports . 
progressive reduction had brought these rates down to 52 percent ( including 2 percent special customs duty levied on all products ) and 27 percent ( including 2 percent special customs duty levied on all products ) respectively in the 1996 / 97 Budget . 
the duty structure had become extremely complex due to variable rates for different specifications of the same product and the fact that components and the final product were being charged at different rates . 
an anomalous feature of the tariff structure was the &apos; inverted duty structure &apos; due to which many types of capital goods had lower duty on the finished product than on the raw materials and components used in them . 
the Chelliah Committee on tax reforms recommends that by 1997 / 98 import duty on general machinery ( including machine tools ) be brought down to 20 percent . 
the recommendations however propose levy of countervailing duty @ 10 percent ( which is to be modvated over a period of four years ) on these items . 
in our view , the lowering in customs duty in the current year &apos;s budget may be marginal ( 5-10 percent ) and would be largely restricted to items in the highest bracket of import tariffs . 
the focus , we believe , will continue to be on rationalisation of the tariff structure to reduce the number of taxation slabs . 
with the tariff on raw material ( mostly steel ) having come down quite sharply over the past few years , the inverted duty structure has already been partly rectified . 
we do think , however , that some sops may be announced for capital goods imported for infrastructure projects . 
the change in excise duties over this period has been much less . 
currently excise duty on different items of general machinery varies from 10-25 percent ad-valorem . 
the Chelliah Committee recommends a rate of 10 percent for general machinery . 
we do not expect any significant change in excise duties in the 1997 / 98 budget . 
items currently charged at 20-25 percent are mostly those used in domestic applications . 
we do not expect any sops in this area . 
customs duty structure for ball and roller bearings has been subject to extensive modification over the past few years . 
tariffs , which were as high as 150 percent in the early part of the decade , have been successively brought down and we estimate the effective rate of duty at present at 20-35 percent - depending on the size of the bearing . 
while small manufacturers in the unorganised sector have been adversely affected by the changes effected in the past two years , the organised sector has performed well on the back of firm OE demand and improvements in operational efficiency . 
as user industries become more quality conscious , smaller players will get increasingly marginalised . 
we , therefore , do not expect any significant concessions to be given to the industry in the 1997 / 98 budget . 
tariffs on ball and roller bearings will remain practically unchanged . 
we expect that the rate of excise duty will remain unchanged at 15 percent . 
we expect excise on cotton yarn to be increased from 5-7 percent , implying a net excise of 8.05 percent ( 7 percent + 15 percent of 7 percent ) compared to 5.75 percent in the previous year . 
we believe cotton is becoming relatively expensive as compared to synthetic yarn . 
further , duty rationalisation in blended yarns should be effected . 
we expect excise duty on polyester / cotton ( PC ) blends to decline from current levels of 23 to 17.25 percent . 
this will take care of the existing disparity in higher MODVAT credit available on polyester / viscose blends as compared to PC blends . 
with rationalisation in excise duty on PC blend , we expect share of PC blends to increase in the total blended yarn segment . 
availability of cheap cotton will aid this growth . 
the composite mills stand to gain from excise rationalisation . 
moreover , with raw cotton prices ruling steady at current low levels , we expect a good H2 fiscal 1997 and H1 fiscal 1998 for the cotton spinning and composite mills in the country . 
we expect excise duty on synthetic threads to be reduced from the present level of 23 to 15 percent . 
this reduction has been long overdue and we believe the reduction shall be implemented in the forthcoming budget , especially in light of poor profitability of thread majors in the organised sector and large scale duty evasion by the unorganised sector . 
coats Viyella India Ltd. and Mahavir spinning and General Mills Ltd . , the two thread majors in the organised sector , will gain tremendously from this reduction . 
we expect customs duty and excise duty on fibres and intermediates to move in line with the Chelliah Committee recommendations . 
most of these were already implemented in the last Budget . 
we expect further reduction in duties . 
although excise duty on PFY qand PSF is expected to decline sharply , we do not expect major upside for the polyester sector . 
this is primarily due to significant supply overhang and depressed market conditions . 
we expect DCL polyester Ltd. and Sanghi polyester Ltd. to report losses in the current fiscal . 
we expect Indo Rama Synthetics to report profits for the current fiscal , driven by substantial polyester capacity implementation . 
however , the accounting policies of the company are subject to dispute and we do not advise investment till clarity is achieved both on disclosure norms as well as proposed investments in PTA and textile projects . 
we expect a 5 percent decline in customs and excise duties for polymers - to 25 and 20 percent respectively . 
the Chelliah norms on customs tariff shall be achieved whereas on the excise front we expect the reduction to 15 percent to be effected by the 1998 Budget . 
we do not expect significant changes in global polymer prices over the next one year . 
however , domestic polymer margins should contract because of decline in tariff protection and increase in feedstock costs , both naptha and natural gas ( at least a 15-20 percent price hike ) . 
we do not expect any new developments in the budget . 
the government may have to make an additional provision of 11.5 billion rupees for outstanding subsidy arrears if it intends to settle arrears accounts for Chambal fertiliser ( estimated at 3 billion rupees ) , Tata Chemicals ( estimated at 6 billion rupees and Oswal Chemicals ( estimated at 2.5 billion rupees ) . 
the Oswal Chemicals settlement may not fructify immediately , however , we are relatively more hopeful about Chambal and Tata Chemicals with aggregate dues of 9 billion rupees . 
in addition , the government will have to make a further 3.5 billion rupees provision for fiscal 1998 additional subsidy reimbursement for Tata Chemicals and Chambal fertilisers . 
further , fertiliser imports in fiscal 1997 was lower because of previous year inventories . 
in case urea price is not increased ( a 10 percent hike is being considered but not expected before the Budget ) , the government shall provide an additional 30 billion rupees in the fiscal 1998 Budget as fertiliser subsidy . 
if the increase is lower , we can expect further delay in subsidy reimbursement for Tata Chemicals and Chambal fertilisers . 
we do not expect such an increase in fertiliser subsidy in this Budget , given the fiscal deficit constraints .
