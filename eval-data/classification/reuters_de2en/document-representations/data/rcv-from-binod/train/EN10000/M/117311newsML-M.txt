U.S. West Coast crude prices drifted lower with cash markets , but discounts for bellwether Alaska North Slope ( ANS ) remained flat on weak demand from refiners . 
sharp gains on overnight access put November crude at a new post-Gulf War high of $ 25.72 , and left buyers concerned about profit margins on Tuesday . 
&quot; ( refiners ) were a little reluctant to jump in at those levels , &quot; a West Coast broker said . 
line 63 diffs remained unchanged at $ 3.20 to $ 3.00 under spot WTI for November delivery . 
California heavy crudes rose 15 cent with an increase in Texaco &apos;s posted prices on October 14 . 
Kern River crude reached $ 17.30 / 17.50 a barrel . 
values for Wilmington crude increased to $ 18.65 / 18.75 a barrel .
