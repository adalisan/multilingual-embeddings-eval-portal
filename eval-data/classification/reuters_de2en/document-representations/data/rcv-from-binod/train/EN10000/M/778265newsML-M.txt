euro low sulphur straight-run fetched a largely steady price on Tuesday but some sellers increased their price on the back of higher futures , traders said . 
they said a refiner sold a prompt loader of low sulphur straight-run to an independent trader at $ 110 / $ 112 fob Sines , compared with $ 110 / $ 112 that a cargo fetched on Friday . 
but one seller of 0.5-0.7 percent sulphur material said he was offering at $ 117 / $ 118 , compared with $ 115 on Monday , after crude futures gained . 
&quot; It is just following crude , &quot; the seller said . 
other trades said that Tuesday &apos;s seller could not have got a better price as the cargo was quiet prompt and only two other buyers bid lower , about $ 108 fob a tonne and $ 115 CIF a tonne respectively . 
shipping sources said the independent trader was looking for 40-80,000 tonnes of high sulphur straight-run out of Ventspils and Tallin for August 15-20 loading to go to the U.K. , the Mediterranean or Trans-Atlantic . 
Russian high-sulphur straight-run was also offered stronger . 
traders said two E-4s were on offer at a strong three means plus $ 5 , or $ 2 up on last done , but some doubted they would fetch that figure . 
two M-40s were at two means plus $ 4 , or $ 1 higher than earlier in the day .
