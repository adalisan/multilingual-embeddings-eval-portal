Marxist rebels stood firm in their demands on Monday , refusing to release 74 hostages held at the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence in Lima unless the government freed hundreds of jailed comrades . 
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) leader Nestor Cerpa told Peruvian government negotiator Domingo Palermo in a written note on Sunday to cancel a planned meeting unless he was prepared to discuss liberating MRTA prisoners . 
the curt message , delivered to Palermo via Red Cross officials , dashed hopes of a swift end to the crisis and showed how little the two sides had shifted their positions since the 27-day standoff began . 
the breakdown in talks was seen as a major blow by Japanese officials who are concerned about the safety of two dozen Japanese businessmen and diplomats still held captive . 
&quot; The situation remains extremely tough and difficult , allowing no pre-judgment , &quot; Japan &apos;s Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a news conference in Singapore . 
&quot; We hope direct negotiations will be resumed as soon as posssible . 
Palermo , Peru &apos;s education minister , said he regretted the MRTA statement and sent an immediate reply proposing the creation of a &quot; guarantor commission &quot; of government , MRTA , Vatican and International Committee of the Red Cross representatives to seek a peaceful end to the crisis . 
&quot; This proposal has the healthy intention of facilitating the peaceful outcome we all wish for , &quot; Palermo &apos;s note to Cerpa said . 
the rebels placed a sign in an upper window of the diplomatic mansion overnight saying they had asked Palermo to allow a local television network to enter the building to &quot; make a public reply to the proposal . 
President Alberto Fujimori , who has staked his political reputation on wiping out Peru &apos;s insurgent groups , has refused to meet the MRTA &apos;s main demand to free their comrades . 
but Palermo left the door open for negotiation with the rebels , saying his proposal &quot; may naturally be modified with any suggestions that may be considered suitable . 
Hashimoto said he trusted the government &apos;s strategy would pay off . 
&quot; We very much hope tenacious efforts will be made to free the hostages in a peaceful resolution , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We have complete faith in the Peruvian government . 
political leaders in Peru , who have backed Fujimori &apos;s tough line with the rebels , supported the new government initiative . 
Michel Azcueta , mayor of one of Lima &apos;s poorest shantytowns , Villa Salvador , welcomed the government &apos;s commitment to reaching a peaceful end but urged both sides to seek a lasting solution to the crisis . 
&quot; Both the government and the MRTA have to assume the will of the vast majority of Peruvians who want peace and justice for the country and want lives to be respected , &quot; Azcueta told the local RPP radio station . 
the MRTA rebels are armed with assault rifles and grenades and have booby-trapped and mined the diplomatic compound against a surprise attack . 
Sunday &apos;s planned meeting , arranged in a walkie-talkie conversation between Palermo and Cerpa on Friday , would have been their second face-to-face encounter since the rebels stormed a diplomatic reception on Dec . 17 , taking more than 500 hostages . 
the two men had not met since holding talks inside the residence on Dec . 28 , after which 20 hostages were freed . 
they have since exchanged several written messages . 
of the hundreds of hostages originally taken , the MRTA has released the majority in what it called &quot; goodwill gestures . 
&quot; The remaining 74 captives include dozens of Peruvian officials and Japanese businessmen as well as Fujimori &apos;s younger brother , Pedro , and the Japanese and Bolivian ambassadors . 
no hostages have been released since New Year &apos;s Day . 
Peruvians , who spent a subdued Christmas and New Year overshadowed by the hostage crisis , enjoyed a brief respite on Sunday night when the national soccer team beat neighbours Chile in a World Cup qualifying match . 
scores of fans , many with painted faces and waving flags , congregated outside the besieged residence after the game singing the national anthem and chanting for the hostages to be released .
