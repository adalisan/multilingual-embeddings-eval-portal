NWE cracked fuel oil was a touch softer on Monday amid a quiet start to the week . 
high sulphur barges were knocked lower in the morning with refinery material trading down up to $ 2 at $ 113 and $ 112 fob a tonne and went quiet in the afternoon . 
traders said there was a lack of offered material which combined with poor physical bunker demand effectively dampened the whole sector . 
high sulphur cracked cargoes also faced a sluggish day with end-user buying interest so discreet as to pressure prices very slightly . 
Russian straight run material was still available despite expectations of a fuel ban in the near future . 
&quot; Its very quiet at the moment , there &apos;s not much material , but buyers are also quiet , &quot; said one trader . 
low sulphur cracked cargoes were easier amid a lack of interest for the larger lots . 
one trader at a major estimated upwards of 150,000 tonnes was homeless up to the second decade of November suggesting further weakness . 
the Turkish tender to buy 55-60,000 tonnes of low sulphur was won by a trader , but gave little support to a well supplied sector , dealers said .
