Kenya &apos;s central bank sold 7.341 billion shillings ( $ 125 million ) of treasury bills at its weekly auction on Thursday despite nervousness over an International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) threat to cut aid , bank officials said . 
the bank sold 6.210 billion shillings of its main 91-day category of treasury bills at an average yield of 18.22 percent compared to 4.710 billion shillings at 18.269 percent last week . 
in the 182-day category , the bank sold 1.130 billion shillings at an average yield of 19.244 percent . 
foreign investors who account for about 50 percent of activity in the secondary market were worried over their debt investments in the floating-rate treasury bond pegged to the benchmark 91-day t-bill , market analysts said . 
&quot; Foreign demand is the leading factor in our market and it will be disaster if they pull out of the market , &quot; a trader said . 
finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi told a news conference Kenya had asked the IMF to extend a Thursday deadline for it to crack down on corruption or lose a big aid package . 
the IMF demanded last month that the government take action to show its commitment to fighting corruption and reforming the energy sector or it would let the three-year aid package lapse . 
the bank invited tenders for seven billion shillings of treasury bills for next week &apos;s auction on Thursday .
