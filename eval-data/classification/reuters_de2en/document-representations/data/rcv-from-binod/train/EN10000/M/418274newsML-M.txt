European meals and feeds remained thinly traded on Tuesday , shrugging off a firm Chicago close on Monday with the higher dollar helping to keep many consumers sidelined . 
&quot; The market in Europe is still very nervous and consumers are continuing to live hand-to-mouth , &quot; one trader said . 
traders said most buyers had taken their necessary protection on Monday and were unwilling to buy further ahead . 
&quot; They may be willing to pay the premiums for nearbys but are not touching the deferred positions . 
the consumers are betting on good sized crops this year to push prices lower , &quot; one said . 
Chicago opened mixed on Tuesday with the market watching for developments in Brazil , where a port strike still loomed . 
however , activity was not at Monday &apos;s levels and workers at the centre of the dispute at the port of Paranagua were due to meet operators to try and avert industrial action . 
&quot; The rise yesterday was overdone and certainly the market in Europe doesn &apos;t have much confidence in the move , &quot; one trader here commented .
