Thai stocks extended gains for the third day on Friday , rising 1.99 percent in moderate trade after investors bought blue-chip stocks in key sectors with the aim of making gains , brokers said . 
the SET index finished 18.48 points up to 948.09 on 5.4 billion baht turnover . 
&quot; Investors , including foreigners , returned to the market today and bought stocks in finance , bank and communication counters . 
the buying came as they believed third quarter earnings for banks won &apos;t be bad as expected earlier , &quot; said Surachai Pramualcharoenkit of Multi Credit Corp of Thailand . 
the market was battered since the beginning of this month on investor concerns over third quarter corporate earning results , especially in the banking counter . 
&quot; Investors are now quite relieved after some banks have released unaudited financial results for the third quarter and all of them were better than their earlier expectations , &quot; said Surachai . 
Siam Commercial Bank said recently its unaudited third quarter net profit totaled 2.33 billion baht compared to 1.99 billion baht the same period in 1995 . 
brokers said investors were now more confident that banks &apos; earnings would not be too bad after small-sized First Bankok City Bank said on Friday its unaudited third quarter profit for 1996 jumped 48 percent to 442.8 million baht . 
for the nine months , the unaudited net profit of First Bangkok City Bank was 3.4 billion baht , or up 26 percent from 2.73 billion baht posted in the corresponding period in 1995 . 
brokers said investors were now waiting for finance firms to submit their balance sheets to the central bank on Monday before deciding whether or not to invest further . 
every major sector on the board advanced on Friday . 
the finance sector gained the most , rising 3.93 percent , followed by the property sector which increased 2.75 percent .
