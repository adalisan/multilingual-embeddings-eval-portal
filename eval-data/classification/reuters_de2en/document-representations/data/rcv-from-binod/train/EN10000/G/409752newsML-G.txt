steady rain forced the fourth one-day cricket international between England and New Zealand at Eden Park to be called off on Saturday . 
the match will now be played on Sunday . 
technically , match officials could have kept the match on until around 2 p.m. ( 0100 GMT ) , allowing for a 25-over contest . 
but with no prospect of the rain stopping they decided to make use of the reserve day . 
England lead the five-match series 2-0 , having won the first two games at Christchurch and Auckland , and tied the third game in Napier last Wednesday . 
new Zealand must win both Sunday &apos;s match and the final game at Wellington next Tuesday to square the series .
