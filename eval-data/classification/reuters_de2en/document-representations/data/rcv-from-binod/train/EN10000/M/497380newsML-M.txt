the Indian rupee ended up against the dollar in the spot and forward market on Wednesday while the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) stood and watched , dealers said . 
the spot rupee closed at 35.84 / 85 against the dollar compared to the opening quote of 35.86 / 87 , dealers said . 
&quot; There was virtually no activity in the spot market today , &quot; said a dealer at a leading brokerage . 
this contrasted with a spurt in dollar demand seen on Monday , dealers said . 
the foreign exchange market was inactive on Tuesday as banks in Bombay , the main commercial city , were closed for a holiday . 
the spotlight on Wednesday was on the forward dollar . 
the forward market saw heavy selling of dollars by exporters , which pushed the six month annualised premium to 5.92 percent , sharply down from the previous close of 6.47 percent . 
dealers said RBI may have refrained from intervention in order to avoid injecting further liquidity into the domestic money market . 
the domestic money market is reeling from excess liquidity as reflected in overnight rates of 0.05-0.25 percent . 
dealers said RBI bought about $ 1.5 billion over the last month , releasing about 60.0 billion rupees into the system . 
at Monday &apos;s repo auction , the RBI received bids for 123.62 billion rupees , the highest amount at any auction since the central bank resumed regular repo auctions this year . 
RBI accepted bids for 46.3 billion rupees at a reduced cut-off of 4.5 percent compared to the previous 4.9 percent . 
&quot; The size of bids reflect the enormity of the excess liquidity , &quot; said a dealer . 
dealers said against the backdrop of excess liquidity , it was unsurprising that the RBI did not buy dollars on Wednesday .
