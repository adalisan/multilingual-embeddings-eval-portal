Hong Kong &apos;s former chief judge Ti Liang Yang , campaigning to become leader of the British territory after China takes over in 1997 , has streaked ahead in public popularity ratings , an opinion poll showed on Tuesday . 
the poll by Hong Kong University gave Yang nearly a 10-point lead over shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa . 
earlier polls had them evenly matched . 
if Hong Kong people were able to vote on the candidates in a real general election , 42.6 percent would vote for Yang , and 32.9 percent would back Tung , the new poll showed . 
in third place was businessman Peter woo with 4.0 percent and fourth was former appeals court judge Simon Li with 1.1 percent . 
but the public will not be casting votes when the winner is announced on December 11 . 
the future leader of Hong Kong will be picked by a China-controlled , 400-member committee . 
the leader , to be known as the chief executive , will replace colonial governor Chris Patten when Britain hands the territory back to China at midnight next June 30 . 
Britain has ruled Hong Kong for more than a century and a half . 
the poll covering 576 people was conducted by telephone last weekend by Hong Kong University &apos;s Social Sciences Centre .
