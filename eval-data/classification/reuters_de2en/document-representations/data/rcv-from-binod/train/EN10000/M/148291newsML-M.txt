emerging debt prices barely moved in early London trading , hanging around the generally weaker levels at which they closed last week . 
events at the weekend , notably the Bulgarian presidential election and Mexico &apos;s economic pact , were largely as expected and provided no impetus for traders . 
preliminary reults show opposition candidate Petar Stoyanov with a clear , if not decisive , victory in Sunday &apos;s election , giving Bulgaria &apos;s ruling socialist party the worst defeat of its six-year history . 
&quot; It was expected . 
even the socialists expected it , &quot; ING Barings analyst Parvoleta Shrtereva said . 
traders said of more interest was the visit this week to Sofia by an International Monetary Fund team . 
&quot; The present round of talks with the IMF will probably be the most difficult for both sides ... ( they ) will be crucial for the continuation of the stand-by agreement , Shtereva said . 
though she expected the Fund would come up with the money , turbulent domestic politics could turn Bulgarian Bradys very volatile over the next few weeks . 
a general strike is planned for next month and it is likely that the opposition will attempt a no-confidence vote in the government . 
Russian debt was also largely untouched , with prices languishing around its recent lows of just over 73 cents for Vneshekonombank dollar paper RUVNUSLNS = RR . 
but traders are quick to point out that its latest drop looks to be little more than investors cashing in their profits after an around 150 percent leap during the year . 
the market in Russian paper is likely to be jumpy until the results of President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s heart operation next month . 
traders are also watching intently for the pricing of Russia &apos;s proposed Eurobond and whether the IMF will resume payments . 
Mexico &apos;s weekend announcement of its economic pact with labour and business leaders for 1997 had no impact . 
&quot; It was mostly confirmation . 
there were no surprises , &quot; said West Merchant Bank economic advisor Peter West . 
he expected to recent Mexican peso volatility , which did weigh on Brady prices , to fade away after the budget is announced next week . 
for the market as a whole , there is little in view to spark a resurgence in Brady prices until later in November , he added . 
the West Merchant Bank emerging debt index has fallen 4.8 percent from its October 8 peak , while average spreads have risen by 100 basis points in what West said had largely been the result of profit-taking .
