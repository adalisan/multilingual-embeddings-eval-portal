Czech consumer prices climbed by 0.2 percent in August after rising 1.0 percent in July , and putting prices 9.6 percent higher than in the same month in 1995 , the Statistical Bureau ( CSU ) said on Monday . 
the result , which countered a stronger upward trend , surprised analysts , although it kept average inflation well over the government &apos;s 1996 target of eight percent . 
the moving average , measuring a average of the last 12 months divided by the average of the previous 12 months , remained flat from July at 8.6 percent . 
the CSU said a hike in regulated natural gas and power prices sparked a 3.2 percent month-on-month increase in housing prices , the main impetus for August inflation . 
food , beverages and tobacco products actually showed a price drop in August of 1.4 percent , thanks to a 29.5 percent fall in potato prices and 25.9 percent decrease of vegetables . 
Radek Maly , an economist with Citibank in Prague , said the the result was better than anticipated . 
&quot; It is very low , I expected the month-on month inflation to be over 0.6 percent , and the year-on-year figure to get over ten percent , &quot; said Maly . 
&quot; What was totally surprising to me was the fall in the foods index , and considering its ( large ) weighting , it obviously pulled the whole figure down . 
the whole structure looks very well . 
&quot; he said . 
the CSU in July raised its average inflation forecast for the whole year to 9.0 percent , and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said the cabinet based its 1997 budget calculations on an inflation expectation of &quot; not below &quot; eight percent . 
Klaus did not specify if he ment the year-on-year or the moving average rate . 
Maly said the August figures might help the 1996 figure to finish below nine percent , but nowhere near the government &apos;s earlier target . 
the government has said it would aim to cut inflation rate by one percentage point every year after 1995 &apos;s rate of nine percent inflation . 
the central bank tightened the money supply in late June by raising minimum reserve requirements and increasing its key lending rate to 10.5 percent from 9.5 percent , in a move to stem domestic demand which has been driving up prices . 
local media reported last week that the government was mulling faster-than-planned deregulation of rent and energy prices at the beginning of 1997 , but officials from the relevant ministries have refused public comment . 
analysts have said that if the government made such a politically risky move , a short-term jump in inflation would be followed by an easing in the core rate , as the current incremental increases are factored out . 
&quot; This would be a great idea . 
it would increase the inflation to two-digit figures ( in 1997 ) , even though I think not over 20 percent , &quot; Maly said . 
&quot; It would be a solution how to radically cut inflation in the next years ... to some five or six percent . 
but it would probably be a political suicide .
