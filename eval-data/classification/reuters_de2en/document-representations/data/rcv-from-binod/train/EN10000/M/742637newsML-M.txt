Argentine bonds closed mixed in thin trading Monday ahead of congressional testimony Tuesday by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan , dealers said . 
&quot; There was very little action today . 
most players are waiting for Greenspan to speak , so the overall trading environment was guarded , &quot; one dealer said . 
he said Greenspan was not expected to hint at an interest rate hike in August in his semi-annual address . 
&quot; But the U.S. economy is performing so well that the slightest word of caution by the Fed chief could spoil the bullish mood in the markets , &quot; said the dealer . 
the FRB Brady bond due 2005 edged up 1 / 8 to 93-7 / 8 while the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 closed off $ 0.17 at 118.05 . 
&quot; The market is regrouping , with a calmer front in Brazil and the focus shifting back to New York , &quot; another dealer said , referring to last week &apos;s devaluation fears in Brazil which hit local stock and bond prices .
