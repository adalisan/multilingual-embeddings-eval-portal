jury selection began Tuesday in the federal bribery trial of Jackie Mattison , the chief of staff to Mayor Sharpe James , whose administration has been tainted by allegations of scandal . 
Mattison was indicted last January on charges of accepting $ 17,000 in bribes to help his co-defendant , insurance broker William Bradley , win lucrative contracts with the city . 
Mattison was accused of helping steer a no-bid contract to Great West Life &amp; annuity Insurance Co. to administer city employee retirement fund contracts . 
Bradley was the insurance company &apos;s contact agent with Newark . 
great West was cleared of any wrongdoing . 
James &apos; administration was the subject of several state and federal investigations . 
no charges were filed against James , who has been mayor of Newark since 1986 .
