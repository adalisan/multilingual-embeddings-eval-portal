Hong Kong &apos;s Democratic Party , which has been vilified by China , said on Monday the territory &apos;s post-colonial leader Tung Chee-hwa had agreed to meet the group for talks . 
Tung had accepted an invitation from the Democrats for a meeting to discuss &quot; the concerns of Hong Kong people &quot; , a party spokesman said . 
the spokesman refused to give details of what the Democrats planned to discuss with the leader-in-waiting . 
no date or meeting place had been set for the talks , he said . 
it would be the second meeting between Tung and the Democrats . 
they previously met to exchange views during Tung &apos;s campaign for the office of Chief Executive in November . 
Tung was chosen this month by a 400-strong China-controlled Selection Committee to govern Hong Kong when the territory reverts to Beijing rule next July 1 , after more than 150 years of British colonial rule . 
Tung confirmed at a luncheon gathering on Monday that the two sides would meet . 
Democrats fear civil liberties in the capitalist city of 6.3 million might be curbed after the handover . 
the Democratic Party , vocal critic of Chinese policies , has been branded as subversive by Beijing and is not represented on any of the China-controlled transitional bodies that are now shaping Hong Kong &apos;s political future under Chinese rule . 
the Democrats boycotted the selection process for the Chief Executive and a provisional legislature , calling both processes undemocratic because Hong Kong &apos;s electorate had no say in the selections . 
they have offered Tung qualified cooperation amounting to a &quot; honeymoon on probation &quot; .
