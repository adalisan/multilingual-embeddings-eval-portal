South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo on Tuesday urged the Zairean government and rebels to reach a ceasefire agreement before looking to the country &apos;s future . 
&quot; First , they should cease hostilities and then look at the future towards a united and strong Zaire , &quot; Nzo , in India for a meeting of foreign ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement ( Nam ) , told reporters in New Delhi . 
Zaire has witnessed heavy fighting since civil strife broke out six months ago when rebels fighting to end President Mobutu Sese Seko &apos;s 32-year-rule launched an armed campaign . 
international efforts to negotiate an end to the fighting showed no sign of a breakthrough after a third day of talks on Monday in South Africa between warring parties . 
Nzo said that the Zairean issue was serious enough for people outside the country &apos;s border to be concerned . 
&quot; Thousands and thousands of people have had to pack their bags . 
that is why it is important that an agreement must be reached , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We therefore have called upon the Zaire parties to take proper attention towards the question of ceasefire . 
in South Africa , envoys from Kinshasa and those of rebel leader Laurent Kabila met through Monday with no tangible sign of any progress in the search for peace . 
&quot; At the moment , it is all negotiations . 
we have to overcome some pitfalls but we hope soon substantial discussions between the Zaire parties to take place , &quot; the South African minister said . 
on Monday , a Zairean government army commander said the rebels were about 15 km ( 10 miles ) from the copper and cobalt mining centre of Lubumbashi .
