a New York City police officer will not face criminal charges for shooting a teenager in the back in April , authorities announced Tuesday . 
evidence presented to a grand jury showed that Police Officer Anthony Pellegrini thought 16-year-old Kevin Cedeno was carrying a gun and that the shooting was &quot; justified , &quot; Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau told a news conference . 
witness testimony showed the youth was carrying a machete as he fled the scene of an early morning street brawl and ignored the officer &apos;s order to stop , he said . 
Cedeno was shot once in the back at 3 : 30 a.m. April 6 in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan , a neighbourhood with a history of tense relations between residents and police . 
the teen &apos;s slaying prompted a public outcry , and hundreds of people protested police brutality at City Hall in the days following the shooting . 
activist minister the Rev. 
Al Sharpton called the grand jury decision &quot; outrageous . 
&quot; That means ... if any policeman thinks anybody is going to do something , he can shoot to kill first and ask questions later , &quot; Sharpton said at a separate news conference . 
&quot; Police cannot use their imagination to use deadly force . 
Cedeno &apos;s sister Carline , who appeared with Sharpton , called the shooting &quot; a cold-blooded murder . 
&quot; This has to stop here , &quot; she said , tears rolling down her face . 
the district attorney said the investigation into the shooting included three dozen witnesses . 
he said evidence showed Cedeno was intoxicated and was carrying an 18-inch machete when he became involved in a neighbourhood melee . 
when police arrived , he ran away &quot; with his right arm folded up against his chest , &quot; the district attorney said . 
Cedeno apparently fled the scene because he was on probation for robbery , he said . 
Cedeno turned partly back toward the officer , who &quot; thought Cedeno was turning to point a sawed-off shotgun at him and that he was about to be shot , &quot; Morgenthau said . 
&quot; Our role was to consider whether a crime was committed , &quot; Morgenthau said . 
&quot; When someone is coming at you at 3 : 30 in the morning with a machete and is ordered to stop by a police officer and drop his weapon , he should comply with that order . 
Pellegrini waived his immunity and testified before the grand jury , the district attorney said .
