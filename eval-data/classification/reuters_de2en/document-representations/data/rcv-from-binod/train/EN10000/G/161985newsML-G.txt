American and Russian experts have agreed to &quot; recess &quot; their session of negotiations on regional missile defences and resume talks in Geneva at some time in the future , a spokesman at the U.S. mission said on Saturday . 
he could not say whether any progress had been made in the closed-door ABM talks or when the negotiations might resume . 
a signing ceremony planned for Thursday was called off at the last moment -- leading the United States and Russia to blame each other for the setback . 
&quot; The delegations have agreed to recess the current session . 
the meeting will resume when the recess ends , but it is not yet sure how long the recess will last , &quot; the spokesman at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Geneva told Reuters . 
&quot; All governments are keeping in touch regarding when to lift the recess and resume the session . 
Belarus , Kazakhstan , Russia , Ukraine and the United States take part in the standing consultative commission which oversees implementation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty . 
the pact is widely considered a cornerstone of international arms control , but the issue of which systems it should allow has bedevilled superpower arms &apos; talks since the 1980s .
