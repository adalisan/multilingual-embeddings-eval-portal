still feasting on the surprisingly big leap in South Africa &apos;s May official reserves , Johannesburg shares powered ahead for the third consecutive day , hoisting the financial index to a fresh closing high . 
basket trading from futures arbitrage lifted heavyweight industrials , but some massive gains in smaller stocks , notably Usko USKO.J after it got some new shareholders , and Publico on acquisition rumours , also aided the overall rise . 
renewed talk of an interest rate cut sooner than later had also begun doing market rounds following a lower-than-expected first quarter gross domestic product figure last week . 
&quot; sentiment is a lot better . 
the reserves gave the market a nice jolt and the bonds and the rand are also pretty steady , &quot; a stock exchange dealer said . 
big index-stock Sappi gave the industrial index a boost rising 8.2 percent or 340 cents to 45 rand on perceptions that the volatile paper and pulp commodity cycle had touched bottom and that the firm would show a major recovery in 1998 . 
&quot; Pulp prices are starting to increase . 
the cycle looks to have bottomed , &quot; said Nico Lambrechts , an analyst at brokerage Huysamer Stals . 
&quot; earnings ( per share ) for the full 1997 year should be around 209 cents from 230 cents in 1996 . 
but in 1998 I expect a 300 percent increase to 884 cents , &quot; he said . 
the bank-studded financial 100 index rose 74.2 points to its second consecutive record high closing at 9,403.6 as futures-led trade upped Stanbic 350 cents to 213.50 rand and Nedcor added 150 cents to 89 rand . 
moderate turnover of around 791 million rand was boosted by massive activity in electrical stock Usko on news that the Metkor Group Ltd had sold a 27.3 percent stake in the firm . 
over 12.5 million shares traded , following on from over five million a day on Monday and Tuesday . 
the stock ended up 11 cents or 26 percent at 53 cents . 
specialist publishing stock Publico leapt 85 cents or 23.6 percent to a new year high of 445 cents on rumours it was to make an acquisition . 
parent Publico Holdings ( Pubhold ) had a similar spectacular 66 percent rise . 
however , after the market &apos;s close it was announced that media group Primedia had bought a 34.9 percent stake in Pubhold . 
all this activity pushed the industrial index up to a 2 -1 / 2 week closing high of 8,428.4 , up 91.6 points or over one percent on the day . 
the industrial June futures contract was almost 100 points up to last trade at 8,135 / 45 from 8,044 . 
the all-share index ended up 60.8 at 7,172.8 , with the near-dated alsi contract at 6,507 / 10 from 6,463 . 
several sizeable bookovers , notably in Forbes and Moregro , and foreign overnight trades in stocks including Iscor and Murray &amp; Roberts also featured . 
on the metals &apos; boards , platinum stocks enjoyed a substantial rise in the white metal price with Implats up almost five percent to 49.75 rand and Rusplats RPHJ.J adding over three percent . 
but gold stocks fared less well , dampened by bullion &apos;s slip below $ 342 . 
the index was off 12.1 points to a fresh 50-month low of 1,145.7 . 
stocks were seen firm again on Thursday , although momentum might slow after the recent sharp rally and moves become more volatile ahead of the futures close-out in two weeks time , dealers said .
