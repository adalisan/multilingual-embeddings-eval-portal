China said on Thursday that Guatemala &apos;s ties with Taiwan had destroyed any basis for cooperation from Beijing in the United Nations . 
Guatemala &apos;s invitation to Taiwan &apos;s Foreign Ministry to attend the December 29 signing of a peace treaty that ended 36 years of civil war had hurt the feelings of the Chinese people , Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing . 
&quot; This action ... has destroyed the political basis for cooperation between Guatemala and China within the United Nations , &quot; Shen said . 
Shen stopped short of saying Beijing would veto a proposed U.N. peace-keeping mission to monitor the end of Guatemala &apos;s guerrilla war but accused Guatemala of hypocrisy in its dealings with Beijing . 
&quot; The Guatemalan authorities not only ... do things that harm China &apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity , but also ask for China &apos;s cooperation in the U.N. Security Council , &quot; Shen said . 
China has withheld support for a United Nations &apos; Security Council resolution to send 155 U.N. peace-keepers to Guatemala because of that country &apos;s close ties with Taiwan , which Beijing views as a rebel province . 
diplomats have said they believe Beijing will not veto the measure but is trying to wring some concessions from Guatemala -- perhaps a high-level visit and an eventual trade mission to slowly wean the Central American country from Taiwan . 
Guatemala has vowed to maintain official relations with Taiwan despite the heavy pressure from China . 
Taiwan bestows considerable economic aid on Guatemala , one of less than 30 mostly small , impoverished states in Central America and Africa that recognise Taipei instead of Beijing . 
China and Taiwan have been bitter political rivals since the two were separated at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 . 
Beijing has sought to push Taipei into diplomatic isolation in its quest to bring the island under communist control .
