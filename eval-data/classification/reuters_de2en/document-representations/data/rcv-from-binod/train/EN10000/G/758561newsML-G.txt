Nigerian journalist Mohammed Adamu was detained by security agents on Sunday after writing a recent article critical of military ruler General Sani Abacha &apos;s security chief , colleagues said . 
the colleagues said Adamu was picked up by three security men from his house in a suburb of the capital Abuja at about 3.20 p.m. ( 1420 GMT ) . 
&quot; They said they had come from the presidency , &quot; one colleague said . 
in the July 14 edition of Concord magazine , one of several publications owned by detained presidential claimant Moshood Abiola , Adamu wrote an article under the title &quot; ( Hamza ) Mustapha - ruthless man behind Abacha &quot; . 
Mustapha is the head of security at the presidency . 
Nigeria holds dozens of political prisoners -- a major sticking point in relations with Western countries , which accuse the military government of human rights abuses and insincerity in its plan to restore civilian rule in 1998 .
