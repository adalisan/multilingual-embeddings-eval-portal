typhoon Niki killed seven people when it roared past China &apos;s Hainan Island on its way to northern Vietnam , the China News Service said on Friday . 
the seven were killed as the typhoon ravaged the resort city of Sanya on the island province &apos;s southern tip , which was lashed by high winds of up to 150 kph ( 93 mph ) and heavy rains , the agency said . 
the typhoon caused a suspension of the city &apos;s power and water supplies , a temporary closure of its international airport and left traffic in chaos , it said but gave no other details . 
typhoon Niki swept across storm-battered northern Vietnam early on Friday but initial reports indicated the region had been spared further major damage .
