Australian Prime Minister John Howard said on Tuesday he wanted to increase his country &apos;s savings and growth potential and that the government planned to almost halve its net debt by the year 2000 . 
Howard , in a speech to the Confederation of British Industry , also said Australia was over-reliant on income tax as a revenue source . 
he added he was opposed to any legally-binding emission targets as that would reduce Australia &apos;s growth by two percent by the year 2010 ( corrects year from 2000 ) . 
Howard said the Australian economy was &quot; strong &quot; and that the country &apos;s future prospects were &quot; exceedingly strong &quot; . 
he said there was &quot; an over-reliance on income tax as a source of revenue &quot; and an &quot; unacceptably high level of taxation at the marginal rate &quot; which was denting incentive . 
he also was opposed to European Union proposoals for legally binding targets for OECD countries to cut the emission of greenhouse gasses by 2010 . 
he said the EU proposals would be unworkable , unfair and would be &quot; ineffective as a response to climate change &quot; .
