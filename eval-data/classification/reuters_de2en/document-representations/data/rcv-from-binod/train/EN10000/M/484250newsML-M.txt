the Mexican peso clawed back some of the ground lost in early trade against the dollar in line with an advance in the Mexican bourse , traders said . 
the peso was still weaker , however , after foreign dealers sold pesos ahead of key U.S. data due on Friday , they added . 
&quot; I feel the slide on Wall Street hit the peso , but it managed to partially discount that when the bourse recovered , &quot; a trader said . 
the benchmark 48-hour peso and its 24-hour stablemate closed three and 2.1 centavos weaker , respectively , at 7.9590 / 7.9610 and 7.9440 / 7.9490 per dollar . 
the Mexican bourse was up 0.89 percent when the foreign exchange market was closing in Mexico , while on Wall Street , the Dow Jones had dropped 1.30 percent to 6,432.41 points . 
traders said the peso had also partly recovered , helped by the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond , which was up 1 / 32 to yield 7.07 percent in late trade , after being down 4 / 32 earlier in the day . 
traders put overall weakness in the peso down to foreign brokers buying dollars to hedge against U.S. employment data due Friday that could weaken the peso by triggering a sell-off in the U.S. bond market . 
&quot; Some foreigners bailed out of the market this morning , as a sort of contingency plan ahead of U.S. data , &quot; another trader said . 
same-day peso contracts had closed earlier in the day four centavos weaker at 7.9530 / 7.9580 per dollar .
