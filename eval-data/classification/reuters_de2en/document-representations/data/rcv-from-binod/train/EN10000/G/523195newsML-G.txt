a relieved Philippine President Fidel Ramos , who has just ended a month as host to North Korea &apos;s most prominent defector , said on Sunday he hoped the episode would add to chances of peace on the Korean Peninsula . 
nervous that Pyongyang might try to kill its top ideologue Hwang Jang-yop , Philippine officials maintained their veil of secrecy until after he had left Manila airport at around 7 a.m. on Sunday ( 2300 GMT Saturday ) . 
Hwang arrived in Seoul three hours later . 
&quot; We are pleased that ... the Philippines has contributed to the smooth resolution of the ... issue to the satisfaction of all concerned , &quot; Ramos told reporters in the first official announcement that Hwang had left the country . 
the North Korean , the most senior official to flee the secretive Stalinist state which now faces economic ruin , defected in Beijing on February 12 and has been in the Philippines since March 18 . 
political analysts said that by helping out China , Manila had given itself some leverage in its dealing with Beijing on the contested Spratly Islands . 
the two are among six countries that claim ownership of the tiny but potentially oil-rich islands in the South China Sea . 
&quot; The matter of the safe journey of Mr Hwang from Beijing to Seoul with a stopover in our country is now finally resolved , and peace and stability in the Korean peninsula will be positively served by this encouraging turn of events , &quot; Ramos said . 
&quot; By such devotion to duty , they ( Philippine officials ) contributed immeasurably to the success of Philippine efforts to consistently promote and enhance peace and stability in our Asia-Pacific region . 
officials cited fear of the safety of Hwang , who was accompanied by his aide Kim Dok Young , as the reason for such secrecy . 
Obervers have been impressed by the success of the Philippines , normally awash with leaks , in keeping Hwang &apos;s whereabouts a complete mystery . 
&quot; Anything can happen during the three hour flight , &quot; a senior foreign ministry official said . 
&quot; It would be easy to take off from Pyongyang . 
they are still in a Cold War . 
to the North Koreans , the life of that man no longer has any value .
