six firemen were injured on Tuesday battling wildfires that burned more than 80 homes and consumed over 25,000 acres ( 10,000 hectares ) across southern California . 
the largest of a half-dozen major blazes continued to threaten the celebrity enclave of Malibu , where firemen were trapped in their truck by a sudden flare-up in a steep canyon . 
Deputy Fire Chief Dave Parsons said the six were airlifted to a Los Angeles hospital where doctors said one man had burns on 70 percent of his body , another had burns on his face and a third was burned on his arms , legs and back . 
the other three firefighters were being treated for superficial burns . 
they were trying to reach a burning house when &quot; the fire just boiled up on them , &quot; Parsons said . 
&quot; They were unable to continue ... because of a car blocking the road . 
asked why the men did not abandon their vehicle and run , Parsons said , &quot; You can &apos;t run away from a freight train . 
the large , expensive house the firemen were trying to save was destroyed , bringing the total number of homes burned in the Malibu wildfire to four . 
eleven people , most of them firefighters , have been injured so far in the blaze . 
firefighters backed by water-dropping tanker planes and helicopters and aided by lighter winds struggled to control the Malibu fire and others burning in southern California , but with varying degrees of success . 
the Malibu fire raced across the Santa Monica Mountains to the sea on Monday . 
by Tuesday it had charred more than 13,000 acres ( 5,000 hectares ) and forced several thousand people out of their homes . 
flames on Tuesday continued to pose a serious danger to Malibu and other coastal communities . 
authorities said the fire was only 10 percent contained . 
the latest rash of wildfires struck almost three years to the day after a firestorm swept southern California from the Mexican border north to Malibu , destroying nearly 1,000 homes and causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage . 
in San Diego County , authorities said a firestorm gutted at least 70 homes overnight in Carlsbad and San Marcos . 
Carlsbad police Lt. Greg Fried said the damage estimate was &quot; extremely conservative &quot; and more than 80 homes may actually have been lost in the 6,000-acre ( 2,400-hectare ) blaze . 
Pete Wilson on Tuesday declared a state of emergency for San Diego , Los Angeles and Orange counties , freeing up state funds . 
he also sent a letter to President Clinton asking that he declare the fire-damaged parts of the state a major disaster area , which would make federal funds available . 
authorities said the Carlsbad fire , which broke out in the Elfin Forest on Monday afternoon and quickly spread to nearby canyons lined with homes about 15 miles ( 25 km ) north of San Diego , was the most destructive fire in San Diego County in more than a decade . 
hundreds of Carlsbad residents were evacuated and four firefighters suffered smoke-related eye injuries . 
one man was listed in critical condition with burns over 45 percent of his body and was being treated at a local burn center . 
marines from nearby Camp Pendleton joined the fire lines as volunteers and civilian fire crews from the base were dispatched to help battle the blaze . 
officials said the fire was 50 percent contained with full containment hoped for by Wednesday night . 
another fire that sprang up overnight in the Otay Mountains southeast of San Digeo had consumed 9,000 acres ( 2,000 hectares ) and had forced the closure of the Otay Mesa border crossing with Mexico . 
a blaze on the Rincon Indian Reservation north of San Diego which started on Monday night consumed 1,200 acres ( 500 hectares ) and destroyed six structures . 
Malibu was the focal point of a massive firefighting effort on Tuesday after a two-mile ( 3 km ) -wide wall of smoke and flame roared across the Santa Monica Mountains from Calabasas , 35 miles ( 55 km ) northwest of downtown Los Angeles . 
fueled by fierce , dry Santa Ana winds , flames raced to the coast in less than six hours , threatening seaside mansions and beachfront bungalows . 
the blaze was being fought by about 2,500 firefighters . 
authorities said they had no clues on the fire &apos;s cause . 
in the exclusive Orange County community of lemon Heights southeast of Los Angeles a wind-whipped blaze destroyed 10 homes and damaged 19 others on Monday . 
it was caused by a downed powerline .
