implied volatility levels rose sharply in the UK &apos;s index options market against a background of plunging world financial markets , dealers said . 
volatility spiked up by more than one percent in some strikes , with the biggest jump in out-of-the-money puts , as the FTSE 100 index at one point posted its steepest one-day drop since the 1987 stock market crash . 
world stock and bond markets plummeted after Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned of &quot; irrational exuberance &quot; infecting markets . 
by 1437 GMT , the leading blue chip index was down 111.5 points , or 2.75 percent , to 3,939.7 , after having plunged to a three-month low of 3,882.7 earlier . 
dealers noted a marked increase in call buying after the FTSE 100 crashed through chart support at 3,900 . 
the futures market was behind much of the downward force in the cash market , dealers said , because options traders who previously were short gamma had to sell futures as the underlying market skidded just to keep options positions neutral .
