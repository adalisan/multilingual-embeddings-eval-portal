CSCE coffee prices surged to new contract highs at midsession , fueled by brisk speculative and industry buying , as traders continued to fret about near-term supply , market sources said . 
benchmark March futures leapt to a five-month high this morning , taking out key resistance levels at 133.75 and 135 cents a lb . 
heavy fund and commission house buying was noted during the rally , along with good interest from the roasting sector , traders said . 
underpinning this morning &apos;s rally were fears a week-long dockworkers strike in Colombia would sharply curtail exports from the world &apos;s second-biggest grower . 
in addition , traders said a report issued by Merrill Lynch suggesting that coffee prices could hit $ 2.00 a lb later this year accelerated the buying frenzy . 
&quot; It &apos;s a combination of factors , but the Merrill Lynch report didn &apos;t hurt , &quot; said one trader . 
traders also cited talk top-producer Brazil &apos;s 1997 / 98 yield could fall short of 20 million 60-kg bags , as well as uncertainty ahead of a meeting Thursday of the Association of Coffee producing Countries meeting in Rio de Janeiro . 
the producers &apos; cartel is expected to discuss an African proposal to cut exports by 2.5 million bags . 
at 1205 est , March coffee was up 5.85 cents at 135.50 cents , down from a peak of 137.05 cents . 
Second-position May was 5.00 cents higher at 131.00 . 
technically , traders said the market benefitted from March &apos;s breach of the 133.75 and 135.00 levels , positioning it for a test of 140 cents .
