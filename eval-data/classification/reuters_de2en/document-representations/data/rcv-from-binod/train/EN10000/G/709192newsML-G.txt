some things never change , not even after 700 years . 
the lord of Chillingham Castle is coming home for the weekend and the staff are in a frenzy . 
the kitchen staff are preparing a banquet of venison and pheasant while gardener Alan Sanderson is busy stacking piles of wood to fuel the two cavernous fireplaces . 
the castle dogs snooze on window seats , dreaming of tasty morsels to come . 
to be sure , the 50 guests for the &quot; mediaeval banquet &quot; are paying for the pleasure , and the castle owner , Sir Humphry Wakefield , makes no bones about why he invites visitors to share his private residence . 
&quot; You open enough to the public to make it from a white elephant into a grey elephant , &quot; he said in an interview at his castle near Alnwick in northeastern England . 
once a moated fortress , it still has crenellated towers , a fortified keep and a &quot; dungeon &quot; complete with Wakefield &apos;s collection of real torture devices ranging from racks to iron ladies -- spiked metal cages in human form that close on their victims . 
the castle was the family seat of the aristocratic Grey family . 
started in the 12th century , it was a genuine stronghold in the turbulent Borders region between Scotland and England . 
as the border calmed down , it was gradually converted into a home . 
windows were built into the grey stone walls , ceilings and walls were plastered and fancy fireplaces installed . 
but by 1932 when the 7th Earl of Tankerville , the Grey who then owned the castle , died , his son decided to pass on paying for the upkeep of a crumbling , and virtually unheatable , pile of stone . 
Wakefield , whose wife Katherine is a Grey , bought the property in 1982 . 
but 50 years of disuse had taken its toll . 
&quot; Everything had gone , you know , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Every damned ceiling had fallen in . 
Wakefield , who has a private fortune and a professional interest in antiques , has filled the castle with artefacts from around the world . 
paying visitors can poke around for a few hours or rent furnished apartments by the week . 
administrator Diane Phillips said 18,000 people visited the castle every year , with about 30 staying each week during the summer . 
&quot; You have to turn your hand to everything . 
you have to know you &apos;ve got to clean the toilets or cook dinner , &quot; she said in between instructing cooks and directing the laying of the tables . 
even Wakefield has to help out . 
one member of staff has fallen ill so he must do a torchlit &quot; ghost tour &quot; himself . 
&quot; Come over here and look over the battlements , &quot; he commands the bemused guests he has led up onto the roof . 
&quot; Don &apos;t be so wet ( timid ) . 
Wakefield revels in opening his castle to the public . 
&quot; It &apos;s like the applause at a lecture -- and they &apos;ve all paid . 
as he speaks , his staff set down before him platters of food , plates of cheese and a goblet of wine . 
looking every inch the master of all he surveys , he dines alone at a wooden trestle table , fires blazing and faithful hound at his feet . 
many of Britain &apos;s noblest families have been forced by taxes , expensive upkeep -- replacing a roof can cost more than three million pounds ( $ 5 million ) -- and heating bills to open their family homes to a paying public . 
some , like Wakefield , keep virtually an open house . 
others try to keep as much of a veneer of privacy as possible . 
across the border in Scotland , Aline and Alexander Hay open their home , the 14th-century Duns Castle , to weddings , film crews and the occasional paying guest . 
&quot; My mother can &apos;t understand why I did it , &quot; Hay , who grew up in the castle , said . 
the Hays dine with their visitors , making them feel as if they are guests . 
others , like their neighbour , biscuit heir Lord Adrian Palmer , flee the paying tourists . 
&quot; The whole family &apos;s in that wing today , &quot; said a tour guide at Manderston , Palmer &apos;s 19th-century stately home that opens on Tuesday and Sunday afternoons . 
&quot; At 5.30 that rope comes down and they all pour out -- dogs and all . 
Richard Wilkin , Director-General of Britain &apos;s historic Houses Association , said it was not always easy for owners . 
&quot; There are obvious irritations , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There is a wonderful moment of calm at five o &apos; clock in the evening when the gates shut and you have it all to yourself . 
but owners knew they had an obligation to the public and were mostly happy to share their treaures . 
&quot; There &apos;s a very genuine feeling that it &apos;s something that , sure , they own it , but also they feel they are the guardians of it and it &apos;s not necessarily theirs exclusively , &quot; Wilkin said . 
many of the owners of castles and stately homes were escaping crippling inheritance taxes when they opened to one and all , Wilkin , whose organisation represents them , said . 
&quot; The arrangement has two aspects -- people who have been in receipt of public money in grants principally from English Heritage have to provide public access . 
they have to open for a certain number of days , &quot; he said . 
second , landowners can get a conditional exemption from inheritance tax for house , land or &quot; important chattels &quot; such as a collection of armour -- but in return have to provide public access to it . 
Wilkin said the arrangements benefited everybody . 
&quot; These are really important entities -- it &apos;s not only the house but the works of art in the house and the garden , &quot; he said . 
&quot; If you are hit by inheritance tax every generation , that entity is dispersed and the public doesn &apos;t get to see it . 
also if you are hit by inheritance tax , you can &apos;t repair the roof and then it isn &apos;t there either . 
owners were better at preserving the houses than organisations like the National Trust or English Heritage , he added . 
and they were great for tourism . 
Wilkin said 11.5 million people visited historic homes in Britain each year . 
&quot; They are central to the tourist industry . 
they not only are they attractions but also they are the honeypots for all the other things like hotels . 
but sometimes the price for maintaining public treasures is high . 
last year Palmer and Hay were turned out of the queen &apos;s Scottish honorary bodyguard , the Royal Company of Archers , for allowing their homes to be used in a film about Princess Diana &apos;s affair with cavalry officer James Hewitt .
