IPE Brent futures held onto their modest gains in cautious trade on Friday on the back of firm gas oil futures and a correction to Thursday &apos;s sharp selloff , traders said . 
but prices were trapped in tight ranges and were expected to stay within Thursday &apos;s parameters as the market consolidates ahead of the weekend . 
&quot; I think the gas oil market is still strong fundamentally , &quot; said one floor broker . 
&quot; We have corrected off the ( Oct gas oil ) expiry and we &apos;re seeing fundamental support and the heating oil in the U.S. is still strong . 
at 1138 GMT , Nov Brent was up 20 cents at $ 23.79 a barrel and Nov gas oil traded $ 2.25 higher at $ 226.75 a tonne . 
Brent has support at its low from yesterday at $ 23.54 and resistance does not come into play until its gap at $ 24.18 to $ 24.23 . 
the northeast U.S. is expected to be hit with slightly cooler weather this weekend but the floor broker did not think that was a major factor for prices today . 
&quot; I think the key is good demand and low stocks and if ( the weather ) helps it a little bit &quot; it will only add to the bullishness , he said . 
brokers Kleinwort Benson said it had raised by $ 3.50 a barrel its fourth quarter oil price forecast because of strong global demand , low heating fuel inventories and rising political concerns about supply . 
Kleinwort now expects North Sea Brent crude to average $ 23 a barrel in the last quarter for an annual average of $ 20.40 .
