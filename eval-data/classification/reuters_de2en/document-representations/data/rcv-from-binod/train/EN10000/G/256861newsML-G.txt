Brazilian striker Anderson rose above the Cannes defence to head a late winner in a 1-0 Cote d &apos;Azur derby victory that put Monaco two points clear at the top of the French first division on Saturday . 
the UEFA Cup quarter-finalists now have 45 points to 43 for Paris Saint-Germain , held 0-0 at Nantes , as the leading pair head for a showdown in Monaco on Janaury 25 after the winter break . 
they have one more game each before the break 
&quot; We now have a two-point lead but the title is still a long way from being decided and we &apos;re going to have to fight up to the last day , &quot; Monaco coach Jean Tigana said . 
&quot; It was a very difficult match on an awful pitch , &quot; said Swiss midfielder Marco Grassi . 
&quot; It was the kind of match that at the end of the championship sometimes makes the difference . 
PSG had the better of a good , exciting match riddled with near misses in which Nantes extended their record unbeaten run to 15 matches . 
French international goalkeeper Bernard Lama parried a close range header on the line from Nantes striker Japhet N &apos;Doram , the division &apos;s joint top scorer , after a fine run and cross by Jocelyn Gourvennec . 
at the other end striker Patrice Loko was foiled first by teenage &apos; keeper Mickael Landreau , then Brazil &apos;s RAI had a goal bound shot headed clear by defender Erwan Guyot . 
&quot; It was PSG &apos;s best match away this season , &quot; said their Brazilian manager Ricardo . 
&quot; The finishing was poor , but that &apos;s only a momentary problem . 
&quot; It matters little that Monaco are in front . 
the main thing was for the squad to regain their confidence , &quot; added Ricardo , whose side had been severly criticised after two defeats in the first division and League Cup in the last week . 
PSG &apos;s 32-year-old captain Paul Le Guen , a former Nantes defender playing his 400th league match , said : &quot; We &apos;re not as pessimistic as those who talk about us . 
it was a reassuring match for those with doubts . 
we had four clear chances in the first half and overall Nantes were under pressure . 
we came here to win and it &apos;s a disappointment . 
to be champions you have to be able to win everywhere , even at Nantes . 
Nantes coach Jean-Claude Suaudeau , usually sparing with his compliments , said : &quot; No one is happy and the Parisians less than us because if it had been a boxing match they would undoubtedly have won on points . 
Bastia won 2-1 at Lille with goals by forwards Franck Vandecasteele and Pierre Laurent to stay third on 39 points . 
Bordeaux , now on 37 , climbed above champions Auxerre , away to Marseille on Sunday , to fourth after a 2-0 home win over Rennes . 
striker Kaba Diawara and midfielder Marc Zanotti scored . 
Metz joined Auxerre on 35 points with a 1-0 away win at Starsbourg . 
French international Robert Pires scored in the 16th minute when he drove the ball home after a poor clearance with his fists by Slovakian &apos; keeper Alexander Vencel . 
midfielder Ludovic Giuly scored twice as Lyon , who eliminated PSG from the League Cup in midweek , won away for only the second time this season , 3-2 against lowly Nancy , the side who toppled PSG last weekend . 
Nancy , who gave a debut to their new Irish signing Tony Cascarino from Marseille , were the only team in the relegation zone to lose . 
two goals by Anthony Bancarel helped Caen win 4-0 at home to Le Havre and climb above Nancy again to 18th . 
bottom club Nice won 1-0 at Guingamp , while Montpellier beat Lens 1-0 at home despite a first half penalty miss by their former French international defender Franck Sauzee .
