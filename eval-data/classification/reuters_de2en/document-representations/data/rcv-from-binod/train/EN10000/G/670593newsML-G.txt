a Mexican set to become the third person executed in Texas in three days on Wednesday ordered a last meal and spent time with relatives as the U.S. Supreme Court considered an eleventh-hour appeal . 
if the Supreme Court refuses to halt the execution and Texas Gov. 
George Bush ignores requests for a stay , Irineo Tristan Montoya , 30 , will be injected with a dose of lethal chemicals shortly after 6 p.m. ( 2300 GMT ) in Huntsville State Prison &apos;s death chamber , officials said . 
the pending execution of Tristan , one of 12 Mexicans on the Texas death row , has stirred deep passions in his home country where there is no death penalty . 
but the case has drawn scant attention in Texas , a state founded on frontier justice that has executed a record 23 people this year . 
&quot; This is no different than any other execution , not as far as we are concerned , &quot; Huntsville State Prison spokesman David Nunnelee said . 
Texas leads the nation in the number of executions since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 and the rapid pace this year has sparked renewed protests from international human rights groups . 
Amnesty International last month said Texas , which is set to kill eight death row inmates this month and is averaging an execution a week this year , is close to matching the pace of executions in countries with justice systems based on Islamic principles calling for harsh treatment for criminals . 
&quot; The state of Texas comes perilously close to matching Iran , Iraq and Saudi Arabia in their astoundingly high rates of execution , &quot; Amnesty International said in a statement . 
Tristan &apos;s execution will be witnessed by his father and two brothers and Mexico Consul General Manuel Perez Cardenas , whose government filed a diplomatic protest with the U.S. State Department alleging Tristan &apos;s rights were violated under international treaties after his arrest in Brownsville . 
Tristan was sentenced to die for the November 1985 murder of John Kilheffer , who was stabbed more than 22 times and dumped in a grapefruit grove near the Rio Grande . 
arrested two weeks later , Tristan confessed to his involvement in the killing but said another Mexican , Juan Villavicencio , actually killed the American , prosecutors said . 
Tristan , a shrimper from the northern Mexican border state of Tamaulipas who often found work in Brownsville , has spent 11 years on Texas death row and grew despondent with his treatment by U.S. courts . 
&quot; The justice system in this country is not working . 
it works for the rich , for the influential , not for minorities , &quot; he said in an interview last week . 
&quot; If I had been able to pay for a good defence and an investigator , all the charges would have been thrown away within a week of my arrest . 
Tristan &apos;s lawyer , Bonnie Goldstein , said his confession was written in English , a language the condemned man does not speak , and he was not informed of his right to meet with Mexican consulate officials after his arrest . 
the State Department this week sought information from Bush on whether Tristan was told of his rights under the Vienna Convention . 
the governor , who cannot grant clemency but could issue a 30-day reprieve , has said he would not delay the execution unless the courts need more time to decide the case . 
the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals late on Tuesday denied a request from Goldstein to file another round of appeals , leaving Tristan &apos;s fate in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court as the countdown to his execution began , prosecutors said .
