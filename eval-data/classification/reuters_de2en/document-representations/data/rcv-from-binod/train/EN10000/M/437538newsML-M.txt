U.S. Plains feedlot cattle bids at $ 66.00 per cwt were passed by owners pricing cattle at $ 69.00 , feedlot sources said . 
sales were expected later Wednesday or on Thursday steady with last week &apos;s price of $ 68.00 , but lower beef prices could result in sales at $ 67.00 , several feedlot managers said . 
&quot; Beef has got some people nervous , &quot; one manager said . 
beef prices on Tuesday were quoted down $ 1.31 to $ 2.21 per cwt , with 367 fabricated loads sold , USDA said . 
heavyweight choice beef was down $ 1.31 at $ 104.66 , which was off $ 3.13 from the same period a week ago , USDA statistics showed . 
however , the large number of boxed beef loads that sold at the lower prices could limit declines , they said . 
light support also could be generated by ideas that packers were short on live inventory and would need to replenish live cattle needs soon , the sources said . 
the strong demand also could offset potential weakness from increased showlists this week , feedlot sources said . 
this week &apos;s showlists were expanded by a carryover of cattle that were not sold last week , they said .
