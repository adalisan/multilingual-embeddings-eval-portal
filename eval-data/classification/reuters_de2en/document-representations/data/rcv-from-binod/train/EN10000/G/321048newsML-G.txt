the 14 , who included four officers and five junior officers , indicated they would appeal , the court sources added . 
they have 24 hours to do so . 
the tribunal is part of new army chief of staff General Mahele Leiko Bokungo &apos;s efforts to restore discipline in the army , which was humiliated by Tutsi-led rebels who seized territory in the east late last year . 
Zaire &apos;s prime minister , Kengo Wa Dondo , has ordered the army to launch a counter-offensive to recapture lost territory . 
Kisangani is the likely springboaard for the long-promised counter-thrust . 
the 14 were accused of fleeing fighting at a bridge 300 km ( 200 miles ) southeast of Kisangani on January 13 . 
defence lawyers argued the soldiers had been inadequately supplied with heavy weapons needed to defend the area .

a newly appointed military magistrate and five other military officers sat on the tribunal . 
their verdict was unanimous .
