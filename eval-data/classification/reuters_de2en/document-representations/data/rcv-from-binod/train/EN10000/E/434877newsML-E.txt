Thai Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan said on Tuesday he postponed a U.S. roadshow for Thailand &apos;s planned $ 500 million Yankee bonds to April from an earlier mid-March schedule . 
Amnuay told reporters the delay stemmed from his current focus on monitoring the battered Thai financial sector and problems related to a four-year property industry slump . 
the minister said : &quot; I asked prime minister ( Chavalit Yongchaiyudh ) for the postponement as some proposals need cabinet approval before we can present them to financial analysts . 
loans to the property sector also require attention . 
Moody &apos;s Investors Service has since mid-February said it would review for possible downgrade Thailand &apos;s long-term sovereign debt and credit ratings of eight major and medium Thai banks . 
the government last week ordered banks and finance companies to set aside higher provisions for sub-standard assets , especially those affected by prolonged troubles in the property sector . 
about 10 percent of total bank loans in Thailand have been extended to the property sector , a proportion that goes up to 25 percent when only finance companies are considered . 
Amnuay last month led a roadshow to Hong Kong for 30 / 100-year Yankee bonds , before the government adopted measures designed to beef up the financial sector .
