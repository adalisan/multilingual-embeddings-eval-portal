French armed forces joint chief of staff General Jean-Philippe Douin on Sunday ended talks in the Gulf state of Qatar that included the prospects of selling French arms to the oil and gas-rich state , diplomats said . 
&quot; The visit was basically in the framework of the defence treaty which Qatar and France signed in 1994 , &quot; said a French embassy spokesman at the end of Douin &apos;s visit , the first by a French army chief of staff to Qatar since the 1991 Gulf war . 
Qatar signed defence pacts with the United States , France and Britain after the war that ended Iraq &apos;s invasion of Kuwait . 
Western diplomats in Doha said Douin discussed during his three-day visit possible weapons sales to Qatar . 
France is the main supplier of fighter planes to the Qatari airforce and is competing with U.S and British arms manufacturers to sell Qatar 50 Leclerc main battle tanks ( MBT ) . 
Douin held talks with Qatar &apos;s Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani and senior defence officials during his visit . 
the French embassy spokesman said four French warships were expected to arrive in Doha by the end of October to take part in joint naval wargames with Qatar &apos;s navy in early November .
