Italian magistrates on Wednesday ordered video footage of Inter &apos;s opening serie A match against Udinese to be seized after a lawyer took legal action against an Inter player whose tackle broke an opponent &apos;s leg . 
magistrates said the seizure was a formality after Udinese lawyer Roberto Cianci filed a formal complaint against defender Salvatore Fresi for a tackle on Udinese midfielder Giovanni Stroppa last Saturday . 
Stroppa , a former Italian international , has been ruled out for at least 40 days after the seventh-minute foul . 
Fresi escaped with a booking for the straight-legged tackle . 
Cianci said on Tuesday that his legal action against Fresi was a private initiative but added that he had spoken to Udinese officials about it and they had not objected . 
ten Udinese fans meanwhile threatened their own legal action against Fresi , saying they had bought season tickets purely to watch Stroppa and now felt cheated . 
&quot; I want to raise the problem as a matter of principle . 
we will try and resolve once and for all whether behaviour of a criminal nature on the pitch can be punished by the ordinary magistrates , &quot; Cianci was quoted as saying . 
newspapers quoted Inter president Massimo Moratti on Wednesday as saying the legal action was &quot; in many ways absurd &quot; and urging Cianci to tone down his rhetoric . 
Udinese &apos;s German international striker Oliver Bierhoff was also critical of legal action and told reporters the issue would be best settled by Fresi receiving a long ban .
