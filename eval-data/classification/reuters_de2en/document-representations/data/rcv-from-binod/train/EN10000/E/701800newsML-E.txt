Banco de Mexico said on Tuesday its international reserves as of June 27 were $ 21.695 billion , compared to $ 21.258 billion on June 20 . 
the central bank said that its net international assets as of the same date were $ 14.128 billion compared to $ 13.602 billion the week before . 
the central bank said the increase in net international assets during the period was due to : 
--Net purchases of foreign currency from the federal government worth $ 297 million . 
--The purchase of $ 20 million from credit institutions , a product of the partial exercising of options on the sale of dollars to the central bank that were issued during the auction of May 31 . 
--Net income from operations by the state oil company Pemex worth $ 170 million . 
--A net gain of $ 39 million for a combination of factors including changes in the dollar value of non-dollar assets and liabilities held by the bank ; net returns on interest rates and from trading of metals and securities ; and net deposits in dollar accounts from commercial banks at the central bank . 
the central bank said that as of June 27 , the amount of money held in a fund to prepay 2006 notes on August 6 had risen to $ 4.536 billion . 
Banco de Mexico said that between June 20 and June 27 the monetary base rose by 1.816 billion pesos due to a fall in the seasonal demand for bills and coins .
