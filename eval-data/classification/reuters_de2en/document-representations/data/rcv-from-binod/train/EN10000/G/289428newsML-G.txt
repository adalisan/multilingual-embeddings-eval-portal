police launched raids against Corsican nationalists on Monday but leaks prevented them arresting anybody , sources close to the police said . 
the raids in the northern part of the French Mediterranean island were aimed at members of Cuncolta Naziunalista , the legal wing of the banned Corsican National Liberation Front ( FLNC ) , the sources added . 
hardline Corsican separatists have recently stepped up their 20-year-campaign for greater autonomy from mainland France with a spate of mostly night-time bombings and machine-gunnings of government buildings or police stations on the island . 
Francois Santoni , head of Cuncolta Naziunalista , and his lawyer girlfriend Marie-Helene Mattei were placed under investigation last month for attempted extortion , complicity in bomb attacks and membership of a terrorist organisation .
