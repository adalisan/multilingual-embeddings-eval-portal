Japan &apos;s two largest opposition parties struggled on Wednesday to heal factional disputes which have kept them from mounting a challenge to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto &apos;s minority government . 
the scandal-plagued Shinshinto ( New Frontier Party ) and the divided Democratic Party , held separate meetings to smoothe over strife that has helped keep Hashimoto and his Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) sitting pretty despite sinking public support ratings . 
Shinshinto leader Ichiro Ozawa beat back a demand from party young Turks that he resign to take responsibility for a massive fraud scandal involving a party member and accusations that the party leadership took tainted cash to promote his candidacy . 
the Orange Kyosai Kumiai scandal , for which Shinshinto lawmaker Tatsuo Tomobe was indicted on fraud charges over a family-run savings scheme which cheated hundreds of investors , has demoralised the party , adding to the woes it has suffered since electoral defeat last October . 
Party officials repeated an earlier denial , based on internal checks , that Tomobe had purchased his way onto a party proportional representation list in 1995 Upper House elections . 
the electoral defeat and the defection of dozens of lawmakers -- some of whom have said they will now vote with the LDP on most issues -- has caused Shinshinto &apos;s strength in the 500-seat Lower House to fall to 141 from 178 when the party was formed in late 1994 . 
in October &apos;s Lower House election , the LDP won 239 seats , 11 short of an outright majority . 
strife in the Democratic Party , formed last year as an alternative to the self-styled reformist Shinshinto , centres on a dispute over whether the party &apos;s 52 lawmakers should stay in the opposition or move close to the government . 
Party co-leader Yukio Hatoyama says the party should build its credentials as a principled opposition group , while co-leader Naoto Kan says the party can best make its clout felt by working with the LDP on specific legislative goals . 
on Wednesday , the Democratic Party shelved the dispute in favour of concentrating on pressing for budget cuts . 
Shinshinto and the Democrats have made inconclusive efforts to work together to force the LDP government to trim billions of dollars of pork-barrel spending from the budget for the fiscal year beginning in April . 
the left-of-centre Democratic Party and the conservative Shinshinto fought against each other in many constituencies during October elections , splitting the anti-LDP vote and enabling Hashimoto &apos;s party to form a government . 
although they both share strong doubts about the LDP &apos;s ability to deliver on promised economic and administrative reforms , they stand far apart on key defence and foreign policy issues , including that of how to deal with growing opposition to U.S. military bases on Okinawa . 
last week the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper published a poll showing that support for Hashimoto &apos;s cabinet fell to 44.2 percent in February , a 7.6 percentage point drop from a month earlier and the lowest since he took office in January 1996 .
