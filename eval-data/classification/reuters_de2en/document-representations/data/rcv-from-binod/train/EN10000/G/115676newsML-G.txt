the soaring cost of medical care and commercialisation of housing now outweigh inflation as the top concerns of Chinese workers , showed a survey issued by the Xinhua news agency . 
about 47 percent of workers surveyed said their greatest worry was reform of the medical system , citing the rising expense of medical care -- once virtually free -- and a growing burden on individuals and employers , it said . 
the survey last month by the State Statistics Bureau , the All-China Federation of Trade Unions , the People &apos;s Bank of China and the Ministries of Labour , Civil Affairs and Public Health , questioned 1,200 workers in Beijing , in the northeastern industrial cities of Dalian , Shenyang and Harbin and in southwestern Chengdu , Guiyang and Jiujiang . 
about 43 percent were concerned most about the reform of the housing policy , the survey showed . 
traditionally , housing has been provided at only negligible rents by businesses or government institutions . 
however , under ongoing reforms , more and more employees will have to share part of the cost . 
only 38 percent named inflation as their first worry , the survey said . 
in the last two years , inflation had topped similar surveys as price rises soared to a Communist-era high in 1994 . 
the survey found the pension system , salary reform , employment , low-income jobs , rights and interests of workers and expenses for children were other areas in which workers had grievances . 
however , experts were surprised that workers showed virtual indifference to the appreciation of the value of their assets and properties , with only 0.9 percent of respondents showing a strong interest , Xinhua said . 
the survey revealed that people &apos;s concerns tended to be influenced by income and age , it said . 
low-income workers were inclined to worry about changes in medical care while those in a higher income bracket were more concerned about housing . 
middle-aged and young workers cared more about housing reform , while the elderly worried about the medical system , it said .
