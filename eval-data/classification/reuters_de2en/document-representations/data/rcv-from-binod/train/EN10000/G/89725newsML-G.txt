Burma &apos;s military goverment said on Tuesday it had detained about 559 members or supporters of Aung San Suu Kyi &apos;s National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party since Thursday . 
officials of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) also told a news conference that the roadblocks on the road to Suu Kyi &apos;s house would remain in place until the situation normalised . 
senior officials said the activists had only been temporarily detained to prevent unrest , and would be released shortly . 
senior Defence Ministry official Colonel Kyaw Thein said 159 NLD members who were planning to attend a three-day party congress from September 27-29 were brought in for questioning to prevent the gathering from taking place . 
&quot; altogether , 159 persons ... were detained . 
all of them were accomodated at guest houses . 
as I speak to you , some are now on their way back home , &quot; Kyaw Thein told reporters . 
he said police detained an additional 400 NLD supporters on Saturday night . 
&quot; We have got information from the people &apos;s police force that about 400 persons were taken in temporarily on the night of September 27 . 
this has been done in accord with the rules and procedures in a bid to prevent crime likely to harm law and peace and tranquility of the state , &quot; he said . 
the government says the party meeting was meant to incite instability and cause riots . 
the NLD has said the gathering was being held to celebrate the eighth anniversary of the party &apos;s founding . 
the United States , Britain and international human rights groups have condemned the detentions and demanded the immediate release of detainees . 
Suu Kyi &apos;s party also issued a statement to reporters this week calling for the SLORC to release the detainees and demanding an end to restrictions imposed on the party . 
the road leading to Suu Kyi &apos;s University Avenue home has been blocked by heavily-armed security police and military intelligence officers since early on Friday morning . 
police originally said the blockades would be in place through Sunday , but they were still up on Tuesday . 
Kyaw Thein and other officials at the news conference could not say when the blockades would be lifted , saying it would depend on the circumstances .
