a fired-up Indian team leads the challenge in the $ 350,000 Dubai creek Open which has attracted 108 golfers from 15 Asian countries . 
the four-day event , part of the Asian PGA tour , starts on Tuesday at the Dubai creek Golf and yacht Club . 
the Indian trio of Jeev Singh , Guarev Ghei and Ali Sher have the psychological advantage after their 2-1 defeat of holders Scotland 2-1 in their debut in the Alfred Dunhill Cup at St Andrews on Friday . 
&quot; The victory over Scotland has certainly done wonders to the morale of the boys and we hope to perform even better . 
but then golf is a pretty frustrating game and anything can happen , &quot; Singh said . 
&quot; Our approach to the game will be positive and that &apos;s what counts . 
Jeev feels it is a question of time before golf replaces cricket as the national sport of India . 
&quot; Though we have only 150 professional golfers , the number is increasing every day . 
our performance at St Andrews will add new dimension to the game back home . 
the Indians are expected to face stiff competition from defending champions Robert Willis of Australia and American John Kernohan , who is leading the Omega Tour Order of Merit with $ 117,778 . 
Thailand &apos;s Boonchu Ruangkit and Prayad Marksaeng , Taiwan &apos;s Yeh Chang Tin , the winner of the recent Singapore Open , and Francis Quinn , a former U.S. Tour player , are among other leading players in the event , which offers $ 56,525 to the winner . 
the prize money has dropped to $ 350,000 from $ 500,000 last year following the withdrawal of the main sponsor .
