disciples of Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav , a revered Jewish sage buried in Ukraine , tried recently to tunnel to his grave and smuggle his bones to Israel , a newspaper said on Tuesday . 
the two would-be body-snatchers dug for three nights last week in a rented apartment next to the burial site in the town of Uman , the Maariv daily reported . 
&quot; The goy ( non-Jew ) -- the landlord -- saw dirt in their room and wanted to clean it , &quot; a spokesman for the Bratslav Hassidim , ultraorthodox Jews who follow Rabbi Nahman &apos;s teachings , told Israeli Army Radio . 
&quot; As he was sweeping , the broom fell into the tunnel . 
Rabbi Nahman , who believed he was destined to be the Messiah , died in 1811 . 
thousands of faithful flock to his grave every year in search of miracle cures for their problems . 
the Bratslav spokesman said the community in Jerusalem was appalled by what he called an unauthorised attempt to remove the rabbi &apos;s remains . 
&quot; We have known for generations that Rabbi Nahman had wanted to be buried in ( Ukraine ) and that is why even now ... we do not take it upon ourselves ( to move his remains ) , &quot; the spokesman told the radio . 
Maariv said the two disciples , who came from Israel , were arrested by Ukrainian police but released because local authorities preferred to keep the matter quiet and allow them to leave the country .
