a heavily armed column of leftist rebels overran a military base in northwest Colombia early on Thursday and reduced it to rubble , killing at least four soldiers , authorities said . 
military spokesmen said most of the 28 soliders at the Heroes de Barbacoas counterinsurgency base in a mountainous area of Antioquia province were asleep when a 150-strong guerrilla force launched the attack at about 1 : 30 a.m. 
the rebels totally overran the base and destroyed it with a combination of rocket-propelled grenades and dynamite , the spokesmen said . 
they said four soliders were killed in the attack , four were wounded and two more were missing . 
the assault by a combined force of Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) and National Liberation Army ( ELN ) guerrillas occurred just 40 miles ( 65 km ) east of the provincial capital of Medellin , Colombia &apos;s third-largest city . 
Interior Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo was to hold talks with provincial Gov. 
Alvaro Uribe Velez later in the day to discuss what the governor has described as the rapidly deteroriating public security situation in Antioquia . 
in remarks to reporters on Wednesday , after guerrillas seized the main highway linking Medellin to Bogota and torched at least 11 trucks and buses at makeshift roadblocks , Uribe criticised the &quot; weak &quot; response of the Medellin-based Fourth Army Brigade and local police to a recent flurry of hit-and-run rebel attacks . 
&quot; This operative weakness leaves the impression that guerrillas are defeating the state , &quot; he said .
