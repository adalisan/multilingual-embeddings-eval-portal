Marcus Allen scored two touchdowns and Pete Stoyanovich had a pair of field goals as the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Seattle Seahawks , 34-16 in an AFC Western Division matchup Thursday . 
Allen scored the 108th and 109th rushing touchdowns of his career . 
he has six this season , tying Miami &apos;s Karim Abdul-Jabbar for the AFC lead . 
Allen missed most of the second half with a bruised right hip . 
Kansas City &apos;s Steve Bono completed 17-of-26 passes for 194 yards and a touchdown . 
Third-year wide receiver Chris Penn had one of his best games as a pro with five receptions for 69 yards . 
Penn , who had just four catches in his career entering 1996 , leads the team with 25 receptions . 
the Chiefs ( 5-2 ) took a 3-0 lead on their first possession when Bono moved them 51 yards in nine plays , culminating with a 45-yard field goal by Stoyanovich . 
Bono found Penn for a 16-yard completion just before the kick . 
Kimble Anders &apos; 15-yard scoring run with 3 : 41 left in the quarter pushed the advantage to 10-0 . 
Allen &apos;s first score of the game came with 3 : 47 left in the half and extended the Chiefs lead to 17-0 . 
the 13-play , 81-yard drive chewed up more than eight minutes and featured a pair of offsides penalties by the Seahawks , each in 3rd-and-short situations . 
the Seahawks ( 2-5 ) finally got on the board with 26 seconds left in the half when John Friesz directed a 14-play drive that was capped by Todd Peterson &apos;s 24-yard field goal . 
Friesz was 20-for-34 for 238 yards with an interception and a touchdown . 
but the Chiefs answered before the half ended . 
Kansas City took over on its 32 and used the two-minute offence to perfection to move the ball into field-goal range and Stoyanovich converted a 43-yard attempt as time expired for a 20-3 halftime advantage . 
the Seahawks capitalised on a Greg Hill fumble early in the third quarter to halve the deficit . 
Allen cashed in another touchdown , again from one yard out . 
Bono directed an 11-play drive that saw Allen convert a key 3rd-and-1 . 
that run and the touchdown burst were Allen &apos;s only carries of the second half . 
but the score , with 21 seconds left in the third quarter , pushed the Chiefs &apos; lead to 27-10 . 
LaChapelle added a four-yard touchown reception midway through the fourth quarter for the Chiefs . 
Friesz capped the scoring with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Joey Galloway with 61 seconds left in the game .
