Kofi Annan , the incoming U.N. secretary-general , said on Wednesday the United Nations needed to redefine its mission , promote reform and make sure Washington paid its huge debt . 
at his first news conference , on the day the General Assembly made his appointment official , Annan pledged to revive staff morale and encourage his staff to &quot; go out and work &quot; even if it made mistakes . 
he also said the U.N. Security Council should be expanded to include more countries than Germany and Japan , the frontrunners for an enlarged council . 
and in answer to questions , he said that France would get one of the undersecretary-general posts , of which there are now 22 . 
Annan indicated previously he would appoint a deputy secretary-general , but had not mentioned names . 
Paris , until last Friday , opposed his election by the 15-member Security Council . 
late on Thursday Annan spoke to its U.N. ambassador Alain Dejammet , diplomats said , but the contents of their conversation were not revealed . 
Annan , the 58-year old Ghanaian head of U.N. peacekeeping , follows Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in the job . 
he was vetoed by the United States in his bid for a second five-year term . 
U.N. members needed to decide what the world body should be doing , Annan said . 
&quot; What should be our business ? 
what should be our objectives ? 
how do we position the United Nations as we move to the 21st century ? 
&quot; he asked . 
&quot; I would hope within the first six months ( of his term ) , we should have some indication or outline as to where all of us want to move , &quot; he said . 
he takes office on Jan . 1 . 
Annan said he expected to work with the Clinton administration &quot; and through them the Congress to get the United States to pay the money due to the organisation . 
&quot; It is not really in the interest of the United States not to pay its contribution to the United Nations . 
it offends friends and foes alike . 
we on our side also have to do what is expected of us , &quot; such as reforms , he said . 
the United States owes $ 1.3 billion . 
in Washington , White House spokesman Mike McCurry said President Bill Clinton had a &quot; very good , warm , congratulatory call &quot; with Annan on Tuesday night . 
he said Clinton told the new secretary-general the importance of pressing forward with reforms , adding : &quot; The president briefly mentioned our desire to address the question of the arrears and said he looked forward to working with the new secretary general on that point . 
Clinton , he said , also suggested that Annan describe further his commitment to reform , particularly in discussions with members of Congress , who have been sharply critical of the United Nations . 
asked how his administration would differ from the current one , Annan said he would delegate powers more freely than his predecessor . 
&quot; In delegating you have to apply the first rule of delegation : know thy staff . 
they will make mistakes . 
but if they make honest and genuine mistakes , that is okay too , &quot; he said . 
on reform of the 15-seat Security Council , he said its composition reflected the political and economic realities of 1945 and had to &quot; be brought in line . 
&quot; I am not pushing for Germany and Japan but there are clear indications they would get in , but they will have to get in with others , &quot; he said , adding that the decision was not up to him but to U.N. members . 
Annan also indicated he would not seek a second term in 2001 , saying he &quot; does not intend to change any patterns . 
&quot; The Security Council , in choosing Annan last Friday , gave preference to an African in keeping with the tradition of giving two terms to each region . 
Boutros-Ghali , an Egyptian , was the first secretary-general from the African continent .
