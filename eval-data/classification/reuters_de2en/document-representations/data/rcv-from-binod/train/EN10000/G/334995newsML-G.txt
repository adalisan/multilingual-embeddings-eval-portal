representative Bill Richardson , President Bill Clinton &apos;s choice to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , was nominated on Monday for the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize by 75 of his fellow members in the House of Representatives . 
the bipartisan group of Congressmen said Richardson deserved the award for his work in freeing hostages in several countries including Iraq , Burma , North Korea and Sudan . 
&quot; He has parlayed his job as a U.S. representative from New Mexico into a roving diplomatic &apos; trouble shooter &apos; who has succeeded in freeing Americans and other political prisoners who are being held agaisnt their will , as well as pursuing diplomatic solutions to pending military crises , &quot; the Congressmen said in their letter to the Nobel Committee . 
his last mission in December resulted in the release of three Red Cross workers held hostage in Sudan by a rebel leader . 
Richardson , a 49-year old Democrat , was named by Clinton in December to replace Madeleine Albright at the United Nations . 
she became Secretary of State last week . 
Richardson must be confirmed by the Senate . 
he is scheduled to testify on Wednesday at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
