Swiss bonds remained under the shadow of the weak Swiss franc but recovered in late trade to end mostly higher following gains in U.S. bonds . 
the U.S. long bond lept by over a point after news the Conference Board &apos;s confidence index fell to 106.2 in October from a revised 111.8 in September . 
the news helped offset worries about tightness in the short end . 
the Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) added liquidity to the money market in the course of its usual morning operations , but some traders were disappointed that it added funds at 1-5 / 8 percent , higher than the 1-1 / 2 percent rate seen recently . 
the addition of liquidity , for 14 days , surprised dealers who believed the SNB was willing to put keep the market highly liquid , backing up its recent statements that it favours using monetary policy to combat any overvaluation of the Swiss franc . 
somehow it is a bit hard to understand , they ( the SNB ) ask for lower rates and now they are giving into market pressure , &quot; one Swiss dealer said . 
but another trader said the SNB &apos;s actions appeared justified in view of extra demand for liquidity at month &apos;s end . 
he expected money rates to steady below Tuesday &apos;s levels , but he still saw strains linked to latest Swiss franc weakness . 
tomorrow / next money was quoted at around 1-5 / 8 percent late but with prices leaning towards 1-3 / 4 percent . 
one bank said it had seen a deal where 2.00 percent was paid . 
the Swiss franc meanwhile drifted down to new 14-month lows against the mark . 
the mark has risen back over 83.00 centimes for the first time since August 1995 and some firms predict a rise to 83.60 based on technicals . 
banks selling the Swiss franc often may need to borrow the francs as deposits against their long positions in other currencies . 
this situation has likely added to the upward pressure on Swiss short-term interest rates , dealers said . 
the long end was also unsettled . 
&quot; We are a bit nervous about our market . 
it doesn &apos;t look so positive , &quot; one Swiss government bond trader said . 
meanwhile , news the Swiss federal finance ministry was calling two bonds had little price impact . 
the 5-1 / 2 percent January 1999 and the 4-1 / 4 percent January 2001 federal bonds will be redeemed in January . 
traders said the market had expected the move , and the Swiss finance ministry has also said it would call bonds as it sees necessary to help lower financing costs .
