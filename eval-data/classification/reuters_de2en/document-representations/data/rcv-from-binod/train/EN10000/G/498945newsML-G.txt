world championship favourite Jacques Villeneuve showed his selfish streak on Thursday when he offered no sympathy for Williams team mate Heinz-Harald Frentzen &apos;s problems . 
Frentzen is pointless after the opening two races in Australia and Brazil and he needs a solid result to boost his confidence in this Sunday &apos;s Argentine Grand Prix . 
as the teams gathered in Buenos Aires for what will be the 600th world championship Grand Prix race since the inauguration of the series in 1950 , Frentzen said he did not feel downcast and expected to be able to win for the Williams team this year . 
&quot; But I have been here only six months and there is a lot to learn . 
Damon Hill was here for six years . 
Villeneuve , who leads the world title race jointly with Briton David Coulthard , said : &quot; We don &apos;t work together so I don &apos;t know what his problems are and I don &apos;t need to -- it &apos;s got nothing to do with me . 
the Canadian lambasted the tight and twisty Oscar Galvez circuit as not being in &quot; the spirit of Formula One , &quot; describing it as a high-speed kart track and comparing it to Monaco &quot; without walls . 
&quot; I &apos;m glad there are no other tracks like this one , &quot; he said . 
&quot; When you hit a bump here , the pain can make you close your eyes . 
on the day that the Williams team announced a one-year extension of their major sponsorship deal with Rothmans , Villeneuve also gave a salutory insight into how he feels the team works . 
speaking at a news conference on Thursday afternoon , he said : &quot; It &apos;s a great team -- but it &apos;s a pragmatic team . 
you get in there and you do your work . 
that &apos;s it . 
but that &apos;s good . 
you are not in there to relax and to have a good time . 
you are there to work and to get results .
