more than 45 percent of the world &apos;s kidnappings take place in Colombia , with someone abducted almost every two and 1 / 2 hours , the country &apos;s leading daily reported on Sunday . 
the statistic highlighted by El Tiempo newspaper , based on figures drawn up by a Miami-based personal security consultancy , makes Colombia the undisputed kidnap capital of the world with 3,600 abductions last year . 
the figure in Sunday &apos;s report is three times higher than that reported by Colombia &apos;s influential weekly political magazine Semana , which claimed in an article in August that 1,158 people were snatched last year -- about one every six hours . 
security firm Kroll Associates told El Tiempo that the number of kidnappings in Colombia was more than three times higher than in Mexico and almost five times higher than in Brazil . 
the U.S. company estimated that about half Colombia &apos;s kidnaps were carried out by leftist guerrillas , blaming the rest on common criminals . 
it said that the &quot; kidnapping industry &quot; netted more than $ 800 million dollars between 1990 and 1994 . 
among the reasons for Colombia &apos;s abduction boom is the high level of corruption among officials and the security forces and the limited success in arresting those responsible -- making kidnapping a low risk business , El Tiempo said . 
more than 600 kidnaps have been reported in the country so far this year , according to police . 
but the real figure could be much higher given that abductions often go unreported because relatives fear the security forces will launch rescue operations that endanger the lives of their loved ones .
