new sales hit gold on Wednesday to snuff out a feeble rally and extend a dramatic fall in the bullion price that began around the New Year . 
&quot; It was the same old story . 
the rally on Tuesday was just taken as an excuse to sell and take a profit , &quot; one dealer said . 
gold was fixed in London at $ 355.80 per ounce against $ 359.00 on Tuesday and a close of $ 359.35 . 
the fixing was just above the lowest since October 6 , 1993 when it was $ 353.50 . 
gold is down 3-1 / 4 percent since the start of this year when a steady slide started to accelerate . 
dealers said a report from an authoritative research group , Gold Fields Mineral Services ( GFMS ) , that gold sales from the official sector had accelerated in the second half of 1996 was a major factor weakening the price . 
GFMS said 123 tonnes were sold by offical institutions -- usually assumed to be central banks -- in that period to give an estimated total of 208 tonnes of gold sold during the year . 
but some market sources were doubtful . 
&quot; How do they know that ? 
there has been no announcement , just lots of rumours , &quot; a senior dealer said . 
however , dealers say that a fear of central bank sales has undermined confidence in bullion . 
the fear is that nations may sell from reserves to meet criteria for European Monetary Union . 
price weakness has increased since the start of the year as investment funds went &quot; short &quot; -- sold gold they do not own on the basis that the price will fall and they will be able to cover their liabilities at cheaper prices in the future . 
&quot; The professionals are selling short this morning and the funds were involved earlier this week , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; There are a few little physical orders coming through under the market but they will not be enough to stem another flood of selling , &quot; the dealer added . 
Bullion market analyst Andy Smith at Union Bank of Switzerland said a major reason for the weak gold price was selling by put option writers as the price slipped . 
a put option obliges its writer to buy gold at an agreed price from the counterparty who has bought the option . 
Smith argued that the selling by the option writers accelerated as soon as the gold price fell through $ 370 taking it below its established price range and increasing their risk . 
gold prices were trapped in a $ 370- $ 395 for most of last year largely by option trading strategies designed to protect gold producers and consumers from moves outside that range . 
&quot; Once the option strangle was broken the selling produced an accelerator effect on the price fall , &quot; Smith said . 
he noted that a year ago when the gold price was rallying , precisely the opposite happened when option writers obliged to sell into a rising market had to buy to hedge their liabilities . 
&quot; The price went from the top of its range at $ 395 to $ 415 then . 
it broke down at $ 370 this time which suggests it has some way to fall yet , although that would be remarkable symmetry , &quot; Smith said . 
palladium was the only precious metal to show any steadiness on Wednesday . 
it was down only 75 cents at $ 119.50 / $ 120.50 while platinum was indicated at $ 359.25 / $ 360.25 , down about $ 2.00 and silver shed five cents to $ 4.66 / 44.68 . 
&quot; platinum and silver are just following gold . 
there is no real interest there atall , &quot; a dealer said . 
palladium was being supported by consumer and speculative buying against Russia delaying its January shipments to Japan , the world &apos;s largest consumer of the metal , dealers said .
