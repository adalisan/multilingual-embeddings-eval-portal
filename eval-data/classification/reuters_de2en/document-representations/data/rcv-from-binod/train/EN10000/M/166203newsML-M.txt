Romania &apos;s new over-the-counter ( OTC ) system said on Tuesday 21 companies were expected to join in trading this week , raising the total number of stocks to 33 . 
in a bid to bring to trading all companies privatised under a mass selloff , new stocks will be introduced in the system daily from Monday to Friday , a RASDAQ statement said . 
the newcomers include a chemical plant , a poultry farm , a ball bearing maker , an electric motor manufacturer , a wine producer , a sugar factory and a chocolate maker . 
the RASDAQ , developed under a U.S. Agency for International Development capital market project , started operating last Friday , after a month of trials . 
its start was modest , with only 8.9 million lei in turnover in the first week . 
market players were nonetheless pleased with the slim volumes traded in view that the market had only just opened . 
they said the number of stocks was so tiny because of delays in being entered in the shareholders &apos; register . 
but system officials said brokers were partly to blame for the low turnover . 
&quot; They should be more active and bring more companies to trading , &quot; an official said . 
&quot; They expect the system as an institution to do their job for them , the way things happened on the stock exchange . 
in the long run , the RASDAQ is expected to trade shares in some 5,000 medium-sized companies , most of them turned private under a mass sell-off which allowed some 15 million Romanians to exchange vouchers for shares . 
analysts say trading will stay low in the immediate future . 
&quot; It takes time for players to get the hang of the market and for company managers to decide to enter the market , &quot; said one . 
they also expect the market to remain unmoved by results of Sunday &apos;s polls . 
partial results show the Democratic Convention opposition bloc ahead . 
according to latest reports , the OTC market on Monday traded 193 shares of Bijuteria SA jewellery maker and marketing company at 2,000 lei per share . 
the stock traded at a high of 4,300 lei last week .
