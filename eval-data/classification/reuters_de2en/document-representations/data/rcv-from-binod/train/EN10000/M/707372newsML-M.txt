Argentine stocks gained momentum at the close Friday and were seen firm when Wall Street resumes trade next week after the U.S. 
independence Day holiday , dealers said . 
&quot; Even though volume was weak with very few players in the market today , prices pushed higher and will be aiming for 850-860 ( on weighted MerVal index ) near-term provided U.S. rates stay low , &quot; said Gabriel Ruiz at brokers Tavelli . 
the MerVal index .MERV rose 0.8 percent to close at session highs of 837.95 . 
it set a second consecutive five-year high and extended gains in the week to 3.5 percent . 
&quot; The international scenario is helping us a lot lately . 
otherwise I think the Bolsa would still be drifting sideways , &quot; another dealer said , referring to the rally on the U.S. markets this week following a jump in the U.S. unemployment rate and the Federal Reserve decision &apos;s to keep rates steady . 
floor volume dwindled to 17.8 million pesos from 33.6 million Thursday , while over-the-counter turnover was virtually non-existent at 2.2 million pesos compared to 113.1 million Thursday . 
the broad market index added 0.3 percent , with winners pounding losers 35 to nine and 25 issues closing flat . 
best main-tier performers were construction stocks Polledo and Juan Minetti , which jumped 9.6 percent and 4.0 percent respectively , on the back of a $ 25 billion combined private and public investment program sketched out by the Argentine Construction Chamber , dealers said . 
the only MerVal losers were foods giant Molinos Rio de la Plata , electricity distributor Central Puerto and carmaker Ciadea , which retreated 1.0 percent , 0.6 percent and 0.5 percent , respectively .
