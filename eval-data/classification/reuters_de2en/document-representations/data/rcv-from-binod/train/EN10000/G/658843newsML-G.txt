Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko said on Friday there was corruption in his country that he was trying to root out but stressed he was not personally involved . 
&quot; We have corruption in Ukraine as in any other country , &quot; said Lazarenko , standing at Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien &apos;s side after bilateral talks . 
Lazarenko , trying to drum up business during a five-day visit to Canada , was confronted with a front-page article this week in Toronto &apos;s influential Globe and Mail newspaper about allegations of corruption . 
it cited a New York Times article quoting Western intelligence reports estimating that Lazarenko gained about $ 260 million from his unofficial involvement in United Energy Systems , which had a license to import cheap Russian gas . 
the Globe said the president &apos;s staff insisted he had received &quot; not a single cent &quot; from business activities because such activities were forbidden by law . 
he declared an official income of only a few thousand dollars last year , it said . 
U.S. Vice President Al Gore stated publicly during a visit to Washington by Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma last month that &quot; all possible efforts must be focused on eliminating corruption from public life . 
Chretien would not comment on allegations of corruption , saying only : &quot; He is the prime minister , and we have good relations with Ukraine , and I was happy to receive him . 
Lazarenko said : &quot; It was the Lazarenko government which was very firm in introducing harsh new measures to combat corruption . 
&quot; He said earlier at the National Press Club that corruption in Ukraine was exaggerated by political opponents trying to undermine his government ahead of elections expected in nine months . 
Lazarenko will spend the next few days travelling across Canada to promote trade and investment . 
about 500,000 people of Ukrainian descent live in Canada , the first Western country to recognise Ukraine after its declaration of independence in December 1991 .
