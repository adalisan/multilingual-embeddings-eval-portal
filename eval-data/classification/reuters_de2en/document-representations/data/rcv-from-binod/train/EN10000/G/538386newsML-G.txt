a weeping Mikhail Gorbachev paid homage on Friday to his long-time friend Zdenek Mlynar , a former Czechoslovak hardline communist who became a dissident after the &quot; Prague Spring &quot; uprising in 1968 . 
Gorbachev , the last President of the Soviet Union , met Mlynar while studying law in Moscow between 1951 and 1954 . 
&quot; He was a friend , but also an inspiration , &quot; Gorbachev , wiping tears from his eyes , said during his eulogy as hundreds of other mainly elderly mourners looked on . 
Mlynar died on April 15 of lung cancer in a Vienna hospital . 
he was 66 . 
after graduating in law , Mlynar rose in the ranks of the Czechoslovak communist party to become secretary of the central committee between April and November 1968 . 
he was the main author of the reform action programme put forward by then Czechoslovak leader Alexander Dubcek , which led to a harsh crackdown by the Kremlin who sent tanks into the streets of Prague in August 1968 . 
Dubcek was arrested and Mlynar was a member of the delegation which visited Moscow later that year to plead for his release . 
he later resigned all his political functions . 
after working in the national museum in Prague , Mlynar signed the Charter 77 human rights document in 1977 . 
months was later offered the chance to emigrate to Austria and then stripped of his Czechoslovak citizenship . 
a year later he wrote his best-known book &quot; Frost comes from the Kremlin &quot; which was later made into a documentary by the British Broadcasting Corporation . 
from 1982 to 1988 , Mlynar worked at the Institute for International Politics at Laxenburg , near Vienna and later lectured as professor at Innsbruck University . 
after Gorbachev helped draw back the Iron Curtain in 1989 , Mlynar divided his time between Austria and Prague where he became active in Czech politics . 
as a Communist reformer of the 1968 generation , Mlynar sharply criticised the country &apos;s full throttle approach to a largely unregulated market economy that followed . 
he stayed loyal to many of the ideals of the Prague Spring -- an attitude that was largely out of step with Czech thinking after Communism fell . 
he was elected honorary chairman of the Left Bloc -- a small group of reform-minded Communists who sit between the Communist Party and the Social Democrats on the political spectrum . 
Mlynar stood for parliament in last year &apos;s elections in which the Left Bloc failed to secure a single seat .
