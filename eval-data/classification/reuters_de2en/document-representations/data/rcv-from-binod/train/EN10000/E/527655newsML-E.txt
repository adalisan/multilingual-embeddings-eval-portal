the Central Bank of Lithuania said on Tuesday it had again outlined its plan to bring back an active monetary policy to a visiting mission from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) . 
the delegation arrived on Monday for a two-week visit to conduct a quarterly assessment of Lithuania &apos;s performance under its programme with the fund . 
Bank of Lithuania governor Reinoldijus Sharkinas discussed implementation of the central bank &apos;s monetary policy plan with the IMF mission , the bank said in a statement . 
the central bank has developed a two- to three-year plan to gradually introduce an active monetary policy , under which it would peg the litas currency at four to one dollar . 
the central bank currently plays a passive role in monetary policy , managing the peg under a currency board system by covering local currency in circulation with foreign reserves at the fixed exchange rate . 
the central bank plans gradually to introduce monetary policy instruments such as repurchase agreements to give it a more active role . 
it says any change to the fixed exchange rate will not happen before 1998 . 
the IMF has been a strong advocate of the currency board system , which it says enforces crucial fiscal and monetary discipline . 
but it says it will support steps to dismantle the model provided they are not taken in a hasty manner .
