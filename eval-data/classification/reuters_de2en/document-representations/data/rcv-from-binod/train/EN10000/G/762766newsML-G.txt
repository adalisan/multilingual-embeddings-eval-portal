U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright swept aside Malaysian leader Mahathir Mohamad &apos;s criticisms of the West on Tuesday and said she did not think he spoke for his region . 
&quot; I think that Dr Mahathir is a case of his own , &quot; she told reporters after major regional meetings in Kuala Lumpur which Mahathir opened with an attack on &quot; unscrupulous &quot; Western currency speculators . 
the Malaysian Prime Minister also renewed his criticisms of the United States during the meeting , to some applause from around South and Southeast Asia , where he is often regarded as a spokesman for the region . 
&quot; He has his views that he stated rather harshly , I felt , &quot; Albright said . 
&quot; They are not reflected , as far as I can see , in the general tenor of the younger generation of leadership of the ASEAN countries , &quot; Albright said of the nine-nation Association of South East Asian Nations . 
&quot; I do think that Dr Mahathir has the perspective that is reflective of his generation but is not reflected amongst the other leaders whom I met , &quot; she said . 
but , she said , not all members of Mahathir &apos;s generation of leaders in their seventies shared his perspective , picking out her talks on Tuesday with former Singapore prime minister Lee Kuan Yew as a highlight of her Asian tour . 
&quot; Lee Kuan Yew is obviously one of the older people in the region and has the most modern and strategic vision of anyone I &apos;ve met in a long time , &quot; Albright said . 
Mahathir &apos;s blunt criticisms were sparked by a heavy fall in the value of several Southeast Asian currencies since they came under speculative attack in mid-May . 
the tough-talking Mahathir called currency speculators &quot; rogues &quot; , &quot; robbers &quot; , &quot; anarchists &quot; and &quot; brigands &quot; with a &quot; political agenda &quot; to &quot; destroy all the progress that we have made &quot; . 
he accused American financier George Soros of deliberately attacking ASEAN currencies for allowing military-ruled Burma into the organisation . 
Soros has denied attempts to destabilise Asian currencies , saying his financial ventures had nothing to do with his opposition to Burma &apos;s membership of ASEAN . 
the organisation also includes Brunei , Indonesia , Laos , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam . 
the United States lobbied hard against Burma &apos;s entry , formally completed last week just before ASEAN had its annual talks with other major countries , including the United States , Russia , China , Japan and India . 
but Albright said on Tuesday that now Burma was a member of ASEAN , Washington expected to see the organisation bring about swifter change in the country , from which democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi has captured huge attention . 
she said she expressed U.S. views &quot; fairly strongly &quot; that ASEAN had to do something &quot; to move the process forward &quot; in pushing Rangoon towards a more liberal regime . 
and Albright said she felt she had struck a resonant chord among ASEAN foreign ministers at the meeting . 
&quot; I think , frankly , that I articulated what some of them had been thinking and were more willing to admit than I had expected that the process in Burma had been slower than they would have liked , &quot; she said .
