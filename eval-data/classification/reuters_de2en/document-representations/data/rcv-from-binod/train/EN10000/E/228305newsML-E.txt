caretaker Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Don McKinnon will represent New Zealand at the first ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation in Singapore next week , the government said on Tuesday . 
McKinnon said although New Zealand has a caretaker government , it was important to have ministerial representation . 
trade ministers from the 126-member WTO are meeting for the first time since the Uruguay Round agreements establishing the organisation were signed in 1994 . 
the conference will review the implementation of the agreements and set the WTO &apos;s work programme for the next two years . 
McKinnon said the caretaker government would not launch any new initiatives . 
&quot; Our main objective is to see a work programme that enables the WTO to move forward on a trade liberalising path , building on what was achieved in the Uruguay Round agreements , &quot; he said .
