President Clinton and Republican challenger Bob Dole were in a virtual dead heat in Texas , according to a poll in the Houston Chronicle Friday . 
dole held a 42 percent to 39 percent lead over Clinton in a poll with a margin of error of 3.4 percentage points , making the race in Texas a toss-up with less than two weeks left in the campaign , the Chronicle said . 
dole was making a campaign swing though Texas Friday , and Clinton was expected to return to the state late next week in his bid to become the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the Lone Star State in 20 years . 
the poll of 734 likely voters was conducted Oct . 7-19 , and showed 8 percent of registered voters polled favouring Reform Party candidate Ross Perot and 10 percent undecided .
