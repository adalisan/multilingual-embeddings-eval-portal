a prominent Chinese educator has said China must promote Marxist teachings to counter the adverse effects of economic reforms , an official newspaper said on Monday . 
Wu Shuqing , the former head of prestigious Beijing University , was quoted by the Workers &apos; Daily as saying that the reforms had led to an influx of alternative ideologies , including non-Marxist and anti-Marxist ideologies . 
&quot; Hostile Western forces are spreading anti-Marxist opinions to subvert China &apos;s socialist system . 
&quot; We must keep Marxism as the guiding principle , &quot; said Wu , an economist who is now retired . 
Wu was named president of the university in 1989 after student led-protests were crushed by the army . 
Beijing University was a centre of the 1989 student movement . 
during Wu &apos;s tenure , Beijing University students were sent on military training . 
Wu stepped down earlier this year and was replaced by vice-president Chen Jiaer . 
Wu said paramount leader Deng Xiaoping &apos;s policy of &quot; socialism with Chinese characteristics &quot; was in keeping with the principles of Marxism . 
China has used &quot; socialism with Chinese characteristics &quot; to endorse many non-Marxist economic ideas . 
Deng Xiaoping has been the key force behind the sweeping economic reforms , begun in 1979 , which have dismantled much of China &apos;s centrally planned economy and have encouraged the establishment of private firms and promoted free market principles . 
the reforms have eroded China &apos;s state dogma of communism , leaving an ideological vacuum that state and party leaders have been struggling to fill .
