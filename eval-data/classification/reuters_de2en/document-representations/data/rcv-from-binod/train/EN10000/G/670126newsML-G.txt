Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen on Wednesday gave his co-premier a matter of days to make a choice between working together or siding with the Khmer Rouge guerrillas . 
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why my partner in the coalition government went to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge . 
now I give you only a few days to decide whether to carry on to work in the coalition government or go to work with the government of Democratic Kampuchea led by Khieu Samphan , &quot; Hun Sen told reporters in an ultimatum to First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh . 
&quot; This is the betrayal which cannot be accepted , &quot; he said . 
Hun Sen was apparently referring to Ranariddh &apos;s recent negotiations with Khieu Samphan , president of the Khmer Rouge provisional government . 
he has called any talks with rebels illegal . 
tensions between the two prime ministers boiled over into violence late on Tuesday night . 
guard units loyal to their two parties exchanged heavy mortar and gun fire , leaving two bodyguards from Ranariddh &apos;s side dead . 
Hun Sen said he didn &apos;t want the violence to spread , describing the fighting as isolated and unsanctioned . 
&quot; It is not a conflict between the parties and parties or Ranariddh and Hun Sen , &quot; he said in this village 90 km ( 54 miles ) southeast of Phnom Penh .
