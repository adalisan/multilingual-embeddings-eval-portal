Singapore refiners are expecting tough times ahead as the oversupplied and depressed Asian oil product markets have prompted the region &apos;s swing producer to cut output , industry sources said on Monday . 
shell Singapore , the largest of the bellweather refiners , announced last week it had cut output at its 435,000 barrel-per-day ( bpd ) refinery by a hefty 15-percent on June 27 . 
shell said the cuts will be maintained until market conditions improve . 
the company has also scheduled a one-week turnaround of a 115,000-bpd crude unit from July 6 . 
industry sources said Esso Singapore has cut output by 10 percent around the same time at its 230,000-bpd refinery . 
but an Esso spokeswoman declined to comment . 
the state &apos;s two other refiners , Mobil Oil Singapore and Singapore refining Co ( SRC ) are not likely to cut production due to different internal needs . 
&quot; That is a huge cut , but for margins to improve the fundamentals need to change , &quot; a trader at a major oil company said . 
&quot; We need China to come out and buy in a big way . 
Singapore &apos;s weekly middle distillate stocks fell for the first time since end May , a hefty 1.331 million barrels drop to 10.744 million in the week ending July 2 , Singapore &apos;s Trade Development Board ( TDB ) data showed . 
but despite the drawdown , sentiment in the gas oil market remained bearish as regional demand was meagre with India making a smaller-than-expected purchase for August and cancelling its tender to buy August 1997-March 1998 middle distillate supplies . 
State owned Indian Oil Corp &apos;s ( IOC ) decision to cancel the term tender was due to the higher than expected offers . 
&quot; IOC was expecting offers that equated to a discount to spot Middle East quotes ( free-on-board ) , but none of the offers were at a discount , &quot; one trader said . 
the term offers equated , at best to a 10-20 cents per barrel premium to MidEast spot quotes , they said . 
the volume of diesel awarded for August was sharply lower than IOC &apos;s 855,000 tonne award for July delivery and well under the market &apos;s expectation of about 500,000 tonnes late on Friday , traders said . 
IOC &apos;s small purchase for August and the decision to cancel the term tenders had an immediate impact on swaps values which lost 25 cents for July and 30 cents for August , underscoring current bearish sentiment . 
but the market was optimistic that Indonesia &apos;s demand in August would help to curb a drastic fall in prices . 
traders also noted that as was seen in Vietnam &apos;s third quarter tender , the contango market reflected better sentiment from September as buyers emerged to stock up for the winter season . 
Vietnam paid a discount of 30 cents per barrel to Singapore spot quotes for prompt July barrels but a 10-cent discount for September supplies , on a free-on-board ( fob ) Singapore basis . 
high sulphur fuel oil prices were supported by a Singapore trader who has bought a total of 120,000 tonnes for July loading in the last week . 
the local trader said he would continue to buy at under $ 100 per tonne , fob basis . 
but a handful of traders were sceptical of any further rise amid unexceptional demand and additional supplies arriving from the MidEast at the end of July . 
high stocks and arbitrage cargoes are also expected to keep naphtha prices down . 
Western traders have fixed cargoes from the Mediterranean to arrive in Asia late August , traders said . 
weak prices in the West , coupled with low freight rates were keeping the arbitrage window open , and threatening the market with even more supplies . 
&quot; The market is bearish until at least October , &quot; a South Korean trader said . 
&quot; The contango is getting wider . 
&quot; buyers are very quiet ... most have tank-top situations and are doing time swaps amongst themselves , &quot; a South Korean seller said . 
adding to the prompt surplus is a fresh tender from India , offering 25,000 tonnes of low aromatic naphtha ( LAN ) lifting July 20-22 from Bombay on the west coast . 
the tender closes on July 10 and bids are valid until July 11 . 
gasoline was also bearish with little demand other than Taiwan &apos;s usual tender for second-half August requirments in a tender closing on July 9 . 
supplies are also expected to rise as the region heads out of the peak demand season and exports from South Korea resume amid high stocks . 
&quot; There are high stocks of gasoline , but it is not a problem and we will only have export avails in September , &apos; said one South Korean refiner .
