U.S. fixed-income managers held their dollar-weighted durations on their debt portfolios steady , an MCM MoneyWatch Inc survey said . 
&quot; Cash positions bounced up a bit , and money seems to have been concentrated in the belly ( of the Treasury yield curve ) as the number overweighted in the five- to 10-year area jumped , &quot; said MCM MoneyWatch vice president Astrid Adolfson , who conducts the weekly survey . 
Overweightings in corporate debt fell back and underweightings in mortgages increased , the survey said . 
the survey showed durations as a percentage of benchmark held steady at 108.1 percent in the week ending June 16 . 
a duration reading above 100 percent indicates the group of investors polled is mostly long on the market . 
a portfolio &apos;s duration represents its average maturity and is used by portfolio managers to calculate exposure to risk . 
in the &quot; next likely move &quot; category , portfolio managers representing 32 percent of total assets in the survey said they would &quot; buy , &quot; unchanged from the prior week . 
strategists leaning toward &quot; sell &quot; rose to 16 percent from 12 percent the week before . 
fifty-two percent of managers said they were &quot; neutral &quot; on the market . 
cash as a percentage of assets rose to 2.92 percent from 2.89 percent registered the previous week . 
the survey showed 31 percent of investors polled overweighted the 10-plus years duration sector , lower than the 36-percent in the previous week , while 9.0 percent underweighted it . 
the remaining 60 percent were &quot; neutral . 
in the five- to 10-year duration sector , 52 percent of investors polled said they overweighted the securities and 10 percent underweighted them . 
the survey included 38 domestic participants who manage about $ 110 billion in fixed-income assets . 
the poll is conducted weekly by MCM and usually is released on Tuesday . 
results of the survey follow : 
category * June 18 , 1997 
duration percentage of benchmark 108.1 PCT 
cash as a percentage of assets 2.92 PCT 
percentage experiencing cash 
results are dollar-weighted .
