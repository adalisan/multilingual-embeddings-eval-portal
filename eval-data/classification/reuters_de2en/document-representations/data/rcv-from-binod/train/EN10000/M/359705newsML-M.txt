physical coffee trade in Europe has quietened down considerably for the past week as roasters , deterred by recent sharp hikes in futures prices , stepped back from the market . 
despite a slight retracement in futures values so far this week , the persistently-high quotations kept a lid on roaster demand . 
coffee prices leaped in January on aggressive fund buying , news of disruptions to Colombian shipments due to a strike , forecasts that the 1997 / 98 Brazilian crop would fall to below 20 million 60-kg bags and expectations of exports cuts by key growers . 
the rally propelled London prices to a high of $ 1,630 a tonne basis March futures by late January , up sharply by 32 percent since the New Year . 
the contract has since fallen slightly to trade at $ 1,550 by late Thursday . 
major manufacturers , caught by the sudden rally , were now either looking for spot and afloat cargoes or distant May-July shipments , traders said . 
the roasters , who had been content to run stocks down since the devastating Brazilian frosts and drought in 1994 , now realised the minimal stockholding could leave them vulnerable to any supply disruption from the origins . 
interest in the distant months was based on growing perception that origin supplies would be tight in the second half 1997 . 
U.S. brokerage Merrill Lynch said in its latest commentary that many central American producers had sold heavily and would have little coffee left to sell in July-December period . 
supply is traditionally abundant especially in the first quarter of the year . 
&quot; Rather than differentials weakening this quarter , spot coffee quotations have remained firm reflecting the low availability of premium coffees , &quot; Merrill said . 
analysts said origins from Brazil to Vietnam were relucant to unload their coffee on beliefs that prices will continue to climb . 
the soaring bean prices has forced some roasters in Canada , the Netherlands and Germany to hike their retail prices . 
the latest to join the bandwagon was Dutch manufacturer Douwe Egberts who said on Monday that it would be increasing the price of a 250-gramme pack of coffee by 25 cents , making an average retail price three guilders 55 cents . 
in physicals , traders said March Guatemalan hard bean was quoted at 10 cents a lb over New York fob while April / May coffee was valued at 13 cents over . 
March Ugandan standard ( screen 15 ) saw offers at $ 50 under London while Vietnam grade two was quoted at $ 220- $ 230 under London fob .
