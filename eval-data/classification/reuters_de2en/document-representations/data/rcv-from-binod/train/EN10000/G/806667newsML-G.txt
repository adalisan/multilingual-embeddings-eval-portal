Israel on Monday said it was easing its freeze on Palestinian Authority funds in response to &quot; partial cooperation &quot; in the investigation into last month &apos;s double suicide bombing . 
but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s office said an end to Israel &apos;s financial blockade hinged on whether Palestinian President Yasser Arafat cracked down on Moslem militants . 
&quot; The main thing has not been done : unconditional , systematic and incessant Palestinian Authority actions against terror groups , &quot; Israeli cabinet secretary Danny Naveh said . 
Netanyahu &apos;s office said Monday &apos;s decision was to free about 30 percent of the transfers in taxes and customs duties Israel has withheld from Palestinian self-rule areas since the July 30 bombing in Jerusalem . 
an Israeli Treasury Ministry spokesman said some 134 million shekels ( $ 34 million ) had been frozen since the attack , carried out by two suicide bombers who killed 14 other people . 
Palestinian officials say Israel has kept back some 220 million shekels ( $ 62.5 million ) of the money , owed under a 1994 agreement on economic links between the two sides . 
an aide to Arafat , Nabil Abu Rdaineh , called Monday &apos;s decision a &quot; positive first step &quot; . 
&quot; We hope the Israeli government will lift the siege measures , including transfer of the remainder of the money owed , &quot; he said . 
U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross spent four days shuttling between Netanyahu and Arafat last week to try to restore security cooperation after the bombing . 
he has called the financial squeeze , imposed along with a security closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip that has kept tens of thousands of Palestinian workers from jobs in Israel , counterproductive . 
U.S. officials welcomed Monday &apos;s easing . 
the step followed a three-way security meeting on Sunday night involving Israeli , Palestinian and U.S. security experts . 
Israel says it received the results of Palestinian checks on explosives found in early July at a suspected bomb factory for the Islamic resistance movement Hamas on the West Bank . 
Israel will use the data in its efforts to pin down responsibility for the market bombing . 
it has also praised swift Palestinian action against three car thieves sentenced to long prison terms last Saturday within hours of their arrest for the murder of an Israeli taxi driver in the West Bank town of Jericho . 
Arafat has resisted Israeli pressure to round up suspected militants from the Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups , as he did in March 1996 after a wave of suicide bombings in Israel . 
he has invited all Palestinian factions to a meeting on Wednesday on the crisis with Israel in a move Netanyahu &apos;s office has branded an &quot; appeasement of terrorism &quot; . 
Netanyahu has said he suspects Hamas was behind the market bombing but Arafat told reporters on Monday that it was still not clear who the bombers were or where they came from . 
&quot; According to our information and according to other information we have proof that they ( came ) from outside , but from where we don &apos;t know , &quot; Arafat said after talks in Gaza with European Union envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos . 
he said he was asking the EU to help push forward the peace process &quot; and to help the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people in this very difficult situation &quot; . 
Arafat accuses Netanyahu of inflicting &quot; collective punishment &quot; on Palestinians for the July bombing and of using the killings as an excuse to wreck the peace process . 
substantive talks between the two sides had already been deadlocked since Israel broke ground in March on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem . 
Arafat wants settlement activity halted as well as end to Israeli land confiscations and the demolition of Palestinian houses built without Israeli permits . 
witnesses said Israeli authorities tore down two structures in the area of Hebron on the West Bank on Monday , one of them an extension to a house and the other a cow shed . 
&quot; They came this morning suddenly without any alarm and they started taking the cows out , &quot; said dairy farmer Mohammad Rajabi . 
&quot; They said they were going to demolish the shed because it was built without a licence .
