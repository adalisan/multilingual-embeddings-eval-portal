Argentine bonds ended higher again Wednesday with yet another strong upward spurt although with more selective buying than on Tuesday . 
&quot; The market is very firm . 
it is getting its impulse from the launch of the global bond , &quot; said a trader at a foreign bank . 
Argentina is due to place $ 2.0 billion in global bonds before the end of January , split between a five- and a 20-year issue . 
Argentina &apos;s FRB Brady bond due 2005 surged 3 / 4 to 89-1 / 4 , while the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 rose $ 0.25 to 125.30 . 
but unlike on Tuesday when peso and dollar issues alike rallied , peso issues did not follow the rise in dollar bonds this session as some investors thought the spreads between the two denominations had narrowed too much . 
&quot; The spreads corrected today , &quot; said another trader . 
the trader said after this session &apos;s slow start , the market really took off as prices did not fall with U.S. treasuries around noon because some players were caught short . 
&quot; I would not dare to remain short in coming days , &quot; he added . 
in the money markets , call money rates rose to 5.48 percent from 5.38 percent .
