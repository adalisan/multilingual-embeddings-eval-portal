the Bank of Portugal said it expected economic growth of between 3.0 and 3.75 percent this year . 
the central bank &apos;s quarterly economic report said gross domestic product ( GDP ) had increased 3.3 percent in 1996 , above the government &apos;s forecast of a 2.8 percent rise . 
it said Portugal would achieve price stability in 1998 and it did not foresee any significant inflationary pressures before the end of next year . 
&quot; Portuguese economic growth should maintain a rhythm in 1997 and 1998 . 
for 1997 the Bank of Portugal forecasts growth of between 3.0 and 3.75 percent , &quot; the report said . 
&quot; Bearing in mind that there is usually some lag before the effects of increased economic growth have an impact on prices and salaries , significant inflationary pressures are not to be expected at least before the end of 1998 , &quot; it said . 
the central bank said prices would continue to come down next year .
