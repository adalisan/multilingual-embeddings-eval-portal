House Speaker Newt Gingrich holds a 14-point lead over Democratic challenger Michael Coles , with only a tiny number of voters undecided , according to a poll published Wednesday . 
Gingrich led Coles by 55 to 41 percent among voters in Georgia &apos;s 6th Congressional District , a band of largely conservative suburbs north of Atlanta . 
the poll follows a barrage of Cole campaign television that has only partially raised the millionaire cookie magnate from political obscurity . 
results showed 28 percent of voters knew too little about him to have an opinion about his candidacy . 
the survey , conducted by The Marketing Workshop Inc. for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and local ABC affiliate WSB-TV , used telephone interviews with 532 likely voters . 
respondents were interviewed Oct . 19 to 21 and the results have a margin sampling error of four percentage points . 
as the first independent poll to be conducted in the district , the results indicated a possible tightening in the political race . 
up to now , the only publicized poll came from inside the Gingrich camp and showed the speaker 29 percentage points ahead of the Democrat . 
the Coles campaign also has conducted internal surveys but has never released the results .
