the government launched a campaign on Thursday to keep young Colombian women from being duped into &quot; debt-slavery &quot; as prostitutes in Dutch brothels . 
Colombian women are routinely lured to Holland via false newspaper ads promising well-paid jobs as models or Spanish- speaking tour guides , a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice said . 
the women , often poor and undereducated , are then forced into the sex trade to repay cash advances for air tickets , room and board -- which the spokeswoman described as &quot; captivity through debt . 
she said the ministry had set up a hot-line for citizens to report cases where they suspected that women were being shipped abroad to work as prostitutes against their will . 
at least 30 percent of Holland &apos;s prostitutes come from Latin America , mainly from the Dominican Republic and Colombia , the spokeswoman said .
