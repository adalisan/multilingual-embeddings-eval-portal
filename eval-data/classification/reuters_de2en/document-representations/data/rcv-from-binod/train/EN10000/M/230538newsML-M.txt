Mediterranean sour crudes were firm on Tuesday , underpinned by delayed Russian loadings , but talk was thin with buyers hanging back in anticipation of a softer market once Iraqi exports resume . 
berth number one at Russia &apos;s Novorossiisk Black Sea port reopened early on Tuesday after a 24-hour shutdown due to high winds , but the queue of crude tankers waiting to load stretched to 10 vessels , including five million-barrel carriers , shipping sources said . 
&quot; buyers are a little more relaxed with the port reopening , but it &apos;s possible that only three vessels will be able to load before the berth shuts for maintenance , &quot; said a trader with an oil major . 
the berth , the only one at Novorossiisk which can accommodate large crude tankers , is due to close for two weeks on December 9 . 
shipping sources also said a pipeline feeding the port would close for 85 hours during December but further details of the timing were not available . 
other traders said benchmark sour Russian Urals was still worth about dated Brent less 10 cents a barrel CIF Augusta , but talk on both sides of the market was thin . 
one trader said the shutdown may be delayed slightly to allow the backlog of vessels to clear . 
alternatively , crude supply to berth one may be prioritised at the expense of vessels due to load at berth two , he added . 
&quot; We &apos;re not willing to buy at current prices , &quot; said a Med refiner , adding that prices for Iraqi Kirkuk crude released last week looked attractive by comparison . 
&quot; We were a lifter of Kirkuk before ( the 1990 embargo ) and would like to lift it again , &quot; the trader said . 
a Baghdad official said Tuesday the first Iraqi oil exports since the Gulf War could be shipped to world markets next week after &quot; initial contracts &quot; were signed with 50 international firms . 
potential European customers said they were unaware of any deals being finalised . 
representatives of a number of European refiners are making their way to Baghdad this week . 
European traders expected Iraqi state oil firm SOMO to sign contracts with 25-30 companies for an average of 15,000-20,000 barrels per day , with lifters taking a standard 500,000-barrel cargo each month or a million-barrel stem every two months .
