German shares ended post-bourse electronic trading lower , after the Bundesbank &apos;s chief economist Otmar Issing said he saw no reason to expect lower key German interest rates , pushing German bonds down . 
the IBIS DAX , which reflects all-day computer trade in the DAX index of 30 leading shares , dropped over 20 points on Issing &apos;s comments to close down 42.85 points , or 1.57 percent , at 2,678.89 , off a low of 2,676.75 . 
SAP preference shares dived almost 24 percent to end IBIS trade down 66.20 marks at 211.70 marks , after the group stunned markets on Tuesday evening with an unexpectedly sharp slowdown in growth in the third quarter . 
the third quarter figures forced SAP to revise down its 1996 revenue forecast to 3.5 billion marks from the 3.8 billion marks previously expected . 
Dietmar Hopp , chief executive of the company which had been the darling of the DAX index , said the market &apos;s reaction to the firm &apos;s profit warning was exaggerated and said a cut in the dividend was &quot; unthinkable &quot; . 
they said the news of the software firm &apos;s reduced profit forecast had hit an otherwise consolidating market and had taken away most of the downward correction potential in one go . 
but traders said the market would keep a keen eye on the U.S. and could post further losses if Wall Street closed much weaker . 
early Dow weakness was already weighing , they said . 
although most attention was centered on SAP , dealers said there was some interest in the banking sector ahead of the nine-month reports of certain banks . 
&quot; If there is disappointment in those results , then the market could really suffer , &quot; said one dealer . 
Deutsche Bank is due to publish nine-month results on Thursday , followed by Bayerische Vereinsbank on Friday . 
car maker Volkswagen AG climbed against the market trend , and ended computer dealings up 1.45 marks at 582.70 marks after the firm said its pre-tax profit soared during the first nine months of the year on what has been strong sales growth .
