Argentina &apos;s fading soccer star Diego Maradona said on Tuesday his new ambition was to trade his boots for a microphone and interview Cuban leader Fidel Castro . 
&quot; This has been my idea for a long time , &quot; the 36-year-old star of Argentina &apos;s 1986 World Cup victory told local radio . 
&quot; I have an enormous desire to fly off to Cuba and conduct the first interview with the commander . 
Maradona , an admirer of the Cuban communist leader , said he would also like to interview South African President Nelson Mandela . 
&quot; First I have got to retire from soccer , &quot; said Maradona , who signed for Buenos Aires &apos; Boca juniors last year but has not played for nearly three months . 
during that time , he has admitted having a cocaine habit and his manager Guillermo Coppola has been jailed on drug-dealing charges . 
Maradona has often announced his retirement from soccer only to make another comeback . 
but last week , after a rare training session he panted : &quot; I haven &apos;t got the strength .
