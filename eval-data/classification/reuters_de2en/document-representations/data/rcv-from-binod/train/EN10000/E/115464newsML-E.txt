Australian manufacturing output prices rose 0.2 percent in August from the previous month and were unchanged from a year before , the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Monday . 
&quot; Higher prices for basic metals and meat were partly offset by lower prices for refined petroleum and motor vehicles and parts , &quot; the bureau said . 
at zero , the annual rate of manufacturing output inflation is now higher than July &apos;s minus 0.2 percent . 
but it remains lower than any rate recorded over the past year . 
in August 1995 , the annual rate of price rises for manufactures was 4.1 percent .
