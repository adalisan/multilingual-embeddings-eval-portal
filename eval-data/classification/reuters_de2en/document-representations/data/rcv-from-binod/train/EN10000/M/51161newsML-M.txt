Belgian linear bonds , which held onto light gains in line with Bunds in morning trading on Thursday , are expected to remain in a tight holding pattern for the rest of the week , traders said . 
&quot; It is very quiet all along the yield curve . 
there is hardly any activity , &quot; one trader said , adding that what business there was seemed restricted to dealers shuffling their positions . 
&quot; There is little domestic interest and no foreigners , &quot; he said . 
traders said there were occasional comments about the child sex , sleaze and murder scandals in the country , but no impact . 
traders said everyone was waiting for the U.S. August Producer Price Index due at 1230 GMT on Thursday , and the Consumer Price Index due at the same time on Friday . 
traders said the markets were waiting to see what kind of magic the government could perform to massage the national budget into shape ready for the European Union &apos;s single currency due to start in 1999 . 
the government has to find savings of at least 100 billion francs for the 1997 budget . 
the premium over Bunds narrowed two basis points to 22 . 
the frontmonth futures contract was 15 basis points up at 117.39 , in a 117.39 / 117.29 range .
