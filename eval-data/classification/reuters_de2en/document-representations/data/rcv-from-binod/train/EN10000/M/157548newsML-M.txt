the NYMEX oil complex was called higher early Thursday , continuing Wednesday &apos;s buying spree on softer oil prices , traders said . 
&quot; It &apos;s follow-through from yesterday . 
there was some buying at the close at these lower levels , &quot; said a trader . 
heating oil was called 0.25 to 0.50 cent a gallon higher after losing 11 percent in the past two weeks from its post-Gulf War high of 76.75 made October 8 . 
crude was called 15 to 20 cents a barrel higher while gasoline was called 0.50 to 0.75 cent a gallon higher . 
&quot; technically we were able to hold support for crude at $ 24.00 yesterday and that was encouraging , &quot; said Refco Energy Group vice president Victor Yu , explaining the bounce in oil prices was also due to technical buying . 
gasoline has been relatively strong due to tightening supplies . 
a focus on distillate output has refiners cutting back on gasoline production at a time when supplies are at 20- year lows , traders said . 
on Wednesday , November gasoline ended up 0.90 cent at 70.00 cents a gallon . 
December crude settled off six cents a barrel at $ 24.28 while Nov heat ended off 1.37 cents at 68.46 cents a gallon . 
in the headlines , Norway &apos;s Statoil said Thursday it had shut in oil production at the 250,000 barrels per day Heidrun field due to a technical snag . 
but traders said the news had no noticeable effect on oil prices in overnight access trading .
