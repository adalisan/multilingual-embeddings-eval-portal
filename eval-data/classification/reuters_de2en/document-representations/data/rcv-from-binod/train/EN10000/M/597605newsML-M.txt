Central European bourses may at times shadow closely daily Dow Jones movements but analysts say local speculators rather than global flows of funds are responsible for day-to-day swings of the region &apos;s markets . 
analysts say that as those markets mature they will grow more dependent on global trends but at the monent major world events , such as the Mexican crisis , have a material impact on Eastern European markets only in the longer term . 
they say , however , that daily changes on Wall Street and other major exchanges can at times of directionless trade give local speculators a handy pretext to shake up the markets and give them a near-term direction . 
&quot; We go through periods in each of these countries where on certain days , or even for a week or two , hard news is lacking and then Wall Street tends to give some sort of direction , &quot; said Daniel Schuopz of Societe Generale European Emerging Markets . 
such a tendency to follow in the Dow Jones &apos; footsteps was clear in March and April , especially in Budapest and Warsaw , with Prague and Bratislava only occasionally affected . 
in Poland scores of small local players have stayed glued to cable TV awaiting clues on the next day &apos;s mood from Wall Street close , but analysts said the link between the Dow and the local WIG index was really just a a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
&quot; There are no reasons for such a strong correlation . 
this is Polish investors believing foreign investors would play in the same way in Warsaw as on Wall Street and trying to outsmart them , &quot; said Grzegorz Cimochowski of ING Barings . 
an April report by Merrill Lynch showed that in 15 months to March 1997 East European bourses had been much less tied to the U.S. market than other emerging markets . 
it said even Budapest , most prone to foreign influence because of a high 75-percent share of foreigners in daily turnover and its relatively small size , was in the long-run less dependent on world swings than Latin American markets . 
the report showed Budapest correlation with the U.S. equity market in dollar terms was around 0.3 in 1996-97 , below Latin America &apos;s about 0.5 . 
Warsaw , with about a 30 percent share of foreign investors , was relatively unaffected with a 0.1 correlation factor and Prague was shown moving at times in an opposite direction . 
but Czech analysts say the Prague bourse &apos;s immunity to world trends was mainly a result of dormant trade and a low liquidity , which kept foreign players sidelined . 
analysts say however any major events such as changes in U.S. rates , which lead inevitably to a global reallocation of funds , are felt by emerging markets including Eastern European exchanges . 
psychology brings investors to act uniformly all over the world when they are worried about a major shift in equity price valuations , they say . 
&quot; International funds flows will take into account not just the one country but how it fits in a bigger picture and how it fits into a picture of improving or declining investment attractiveness in global terms , &quot; said Roger Monson , chief equity strategist at Daiwa Institute in London . 
but analysts say European emerging markets may be less affected by global moods as foreign investors keep looking at fundamentals rather than simply following world trends . 
growth prospects , market transparency and progress in macroeconomic stability were likely to outweigh the impact of movements on world exchanges , said Jacek Dzierwa , an analyst at Salomon Brothers in London . 
&quot; Withdrawal from Wall Street doesn &apos;t necessarily mean withdrawal from emerging markets , sometimes just the opposite , investors want to invest more in emerging markets as their yields are greater than on Wall Street , &quot; Dzierwa said . 
&quot; Investors are interested in emerging markets not because they want to make a copy of Wall Street , but to earn more than Wall Street , &quot; he added . 
analysts said that , after volatile beginnings early in the 90s when most foreign money pumped into Eastern European bourses came from hedge funds , most investors now prefer long-term strategies and shy away from hectic trading . 
&quot; Changing decisions with no fundamental signals on the country , just because Wall Street was going down , would be too expensive because the fundamentals are very different , &quot; Geoffrey skipper , chief strategist at Poland &apos;s Korona mutual fund said . 
&quot; On any emerging market one of the first things you have to do is to make sure that you only trade when it &apos;s really necessary not just because you happen to have a slightly different view on the market &quot; he added . 
analysts said short-term players were most likely to take clues from global moods . 
&quot; If you are going to invest in a country for a three-year period ... you can mostly ignore movements on Wall Street ... if the country has strong fundamentals ... , &quot; said Daiwa &apos;s Monson . 
&quot; But if you talk about a three-month period or a three-week period then global forces are going to have definitely an impact from time to time , &quot; he added . 
analysts said East European markets &apos; dependence on world trends would increase as the region &apos;s markets attract more foreign investment and improve liquidity . 
&quot; I think gradually they ( Eastern European exchanges ) will be pulled into the western European trading flows and strategies of investors and they will become over time more correlated ... the move will be towards convergence , &quot; Monson said .
