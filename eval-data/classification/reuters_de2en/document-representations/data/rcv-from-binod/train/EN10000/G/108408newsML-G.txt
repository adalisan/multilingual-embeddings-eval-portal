an elderly Florida woman became the first reported casualty from Tropical Storm Josephine when an oak tree damaged by the storm toppled on her , police said on Thursday . 
Mary Jane Grooms , 73 , was sitting in her yard on Wednesday with a friend , enjoying the first sunny day in more than a week , when nearby witnesses heard the tree trunk make a thunderous snap . 
Grooms was crushed beneath it and pronounced dead at the scene , police said . 
no other deaths or serious injuries were reported during the storm , which faded on Tuesday . 
DeLand is about 15 miles from Florida &apos;s east coast , more than a hundred miles from where Josephine struck the western part of Florida &apos;s peninsula . 
this is where Josephine did its worst damage , as tailwinds whipped up tornadoes and dropped torrential rains on an area that had already been exposed to weeks of rains . 
the three-story high water oak tree had absorbed so much water in its limbs that the trunk could no longer bear the weight , said Volusia County forester Mark Brown . 
the Grooms family had planted the oak 65 years ago when a hurricane uprooted another shade tree from the family home , relatives said .
