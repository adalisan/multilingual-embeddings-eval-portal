Wellington , Jan 15 - Wellington &apos;s slow bowling combination of Gavin Larsen and Mark Jefferson cut through Canterbury &apos;s middle order to tilt the balance of Wednesday &apos;s Shell Cup limited overs cricket final the capital &apos;s way at the Basin Reserve . 
Canterbury had recovered well from the loss of Nathan Astle for a duck in the first over and then Craig McMillan in the 14th over to be 64 for two wickets . 
but left-arm spinner Jefferson had Darrin Murray stumped for 24 by Chris Nevin from the first ball he bowled and from that point Canterbury struggled to get into a reasonable position in the later overs . 
Larsen cleaned out dangerous left-hander Stephen Fleming , caught behind by Nevin for 19 , off the third ball of the 26th over , and then two balls later accepted a return catch from Chris Harris , leaving Canterbury 98-5 . 
Chris Cairns had to play a much more controlled innings than he usually does and , in partnership with skipper Lee Germon , had taken his side through to 122-5 after 34 overs .
