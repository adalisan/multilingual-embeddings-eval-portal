prop Jason Leonard was a surprise omission from the British Lions side named on Thursday to face South Africa in the opening test of the three-match series in Cape Town . 
Leonard will be on the bench for Saturday &apos;s match at Newlands with Ireland &apos;s tighthead prop Paul Wallace and Scotland loosehead Tom Smith partnering Irish hooker Keith Wood in the test front row . 
lions manager Fran Cotton faced difficult choices with so many players in good form . 
the only member of the 35-man squad not considered for selection was Irish number eight Eric Miller who has flu .. 
&quot; It &apos;s more than just a bug -- he is still in bed now and is likely to be for a couple more days , &quot; Cotton said . 
six Englishmen have been selected for Saturday &apos;s starting line-up , while four players -- tour captain Martin Johnson , Jeremy Guscott , Scott Gibbs and Ieuan Evans -- were test members of the 1993 Lions side which toured New Zealand . 
Scottish centre Allan Tait , run very close for selection by England &apos;s John Bentley , will play on the left wing while Welshman Scott Gibbs is set to resume his successful Lions partnership with the creative Jeremy Guscott in the centre . 
Scotland &apos;s Gregor Townsend and England scrumhalf Matt Dawson provide the halfback combination while Welsh rugby union &apos;s most prolific goal-kicker Neil Jenkins has been selected at fullback . 
England &apos;s Tim Rodber , expected to be challenged strongly by Miller for the number eight berth , completes an all-England back row alongside Richard Hill and Lawrence Dallaglio . 
Irish lock Jeremy Davidson , who has impressed with his muscular work-rate on tour , joins Martin Johnson in the second row . 
Welsh wing Ieuan Evans , set to play his seventh Lions test match in succession at the age of 33 , said it was a tremendous honour to be picked . 
&quot; We are the lucky chosen ones and now we must perform . 
lions coach Ian McGeechan said : &quot; This will be the hardest game any of these players will ever have the privilege to play . 
Guscott , who will make his sixth Lions test appearance on Saturday , is keen to renew his 1993 partnership in New Zealand with Welshman Scott Gibbs . 
&quot; His ( Gibbs &apos; ) physical presence is reassuring - he &apos;s one of the quickest props I &apos;ve ever seen . 
really , though , he weighs 16 stone and he &apos;s a pocket battleship - and the skills he learned in rugby league have made him a better all-round player , &quot; Guscott said . 
British Lions : Neil Jenkins ; Ieuan Evans , Jeremy Guscott , Scott Gibbs , Allan Tait ; Gregor Townsend , Matt Dawson ; Tim Rodber , Richard Hill , Lawrence Dallaglio , Jeremy Davidson , Martin Johnson ( captain ) , Paul Wallace , Keith Wood , Tom Smith .
