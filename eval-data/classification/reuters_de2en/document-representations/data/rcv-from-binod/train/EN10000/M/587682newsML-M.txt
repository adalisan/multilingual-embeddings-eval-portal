sentiment in the German metals semis trade is moderately optimistic as steady or lower stock levels and somewhat higher prices can be expected within the next three months , trade association WGM said . 
&quot; Economic forecasts and developments in the first quarter have resulted in improved conditions for the trade , although it remains difficult to pass on higher mill prices , &quot; it said in a statement . 
WGM &apos;s 52 member companies are involved in stockholding and just-in-time delivery of semi-finished non-ferrous metals products such as tubes , bars and sections . 
they said they saw better conditions for the full year after metals price losses in 1996 reduced inventory values . 
the value of aluminium semis stocks declined by six to 18 percent last year , while that of copper and copper alloy semis dropped by 11 to 13 percent over 1995 , they estimated . 
a poll among WGM members showed sizeable percentages of aluminium and copper stockholders expected better sales and were ready to reduce stocks over the next three months although the majority in both groups expected merely steady conditions . 
German metals semis production in 1996 dropped by 3.8 percent from 1996 levels to 3.14 million tonnes . 
Germany is a net importer of semis . 
the statement was issued to coincide with WGM &apos;s ( Wirtschaftsverband Grosshandel Metallhalbzeug e.V ) annual meeting in Muenster on May 15 .
