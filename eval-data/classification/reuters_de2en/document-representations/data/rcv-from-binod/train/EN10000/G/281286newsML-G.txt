Goh Chok Tong , firmly established as the leader of Singapore &apos;s dominant People &apos;s Action Party ( PAP ) , is seeking a stronger mandate to lead the city-state into the 21st century . 
widely seen as a seat warmer when he was appointed prime minister in November 1990 , the 55-year-old Goh is now setting his sights on remaining in the hot seat for at least 10 more years . 
&quot; First I am going to fight in this election , &quot; Goh said when asked by a university student who his successor would be . 
the appointment of former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew as Senior Minister in Goh &apos;s cabinet and the patriarch &apos;s eldest son , Lee Hsien Loong , as a deputy prime minister led to speculation that Goh was going to be a lame duck , one-term prime minister . 
but over the past few years Goh has emerged from Lee &apos;s shadow to establish himself as the undisputed leader of the party and the government since joining politics in 1976 under the wing of former finance minister Hon Sui Sen. 
early in 1996 , Goh did not flinch from calling for an investigation when the lees were accused of impropriety over their purchase of private residential properties at a discount . 
following an inquiry , Goh told Parliament the lees did nothing wrong . 
in July he dismissed Lee &apos;s suggestion of a possible re-merger with Malaysia as not being a part of his agenda . 
&quot; He has actually established himself very well ... we , all the members of parliament ( MPs ) , regard him very highly now . 
the PAP is already guaranteed five more years in power , winning a parliamentary majority before a single vote was cast when the opposition decided not to fight for 47 seats in the 83-member parliament . 
it was the second successive election that the PAP won a majority before election day . 
this time , unlike in the last elections in 1991 , Goh was returned uncontested . 
analysts said the opposition had clearly decided he was undefeatable . 
voting for the remaining 36 seats takes place on January 2 . 
Goh was not Lee Kuan Yew &apos;s first choice for the top job . 
Lee preferred Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan as his successor and went as far as to describe Goh as &quot; wooden &quot; in speech . 
but his colleagues picked Goh as leader , anyway . 
he has proven his mettle with innovative policies such as national medical savings and insurance programmes , formation of town councils and upgrading of old public housing estates . 
&quot; He has got this inner strength which many people may not know . 
&quot; He wants to do certain things . 
I know he will do it ... but he doesn &apos;t push and ride roughshod over you , &quot; he added . 
Goh &apos;s style of a more consultative government and gentler response to criticism has spurred a new wave of political debate . 
&quot; This has also been a year of some of the most open political debates I have seen on many important issues , &quot; The Straits Times newspaper quoted academic Toh Thian SER as saying . 
despite his strong grassroot support and amicable style , Goh might not be able to carry all PAP candidates on his coat tails . 
in the 1991 elections , Goh made himself and his new style of government the issue . 
nevertheless , the PAP lost four seats and its share of the vote was trimmed to 61 percent from 63.2 percent in 1988 . 
the opposition &apos;s tactic of allowing the PAP back to power ahead of the vote , which they have repeated this time , allowed them to gain more votes from an electorate uninterested in ousting the PAP . 
to counter the tactic this time , Goh has raised the stakes by tying votes to schemes such as a Singapore $ 20 billion ( US $ 14.3 billion ) refurbishment plan of public housing estates . 
he told voters bluntly their constituency would lose out if it they voted for the opposition . 
&quot; Then you &apos;ll be left behind , then in 20 , 30 years &apos; time , the whole of Singapore will be bustling away and your estate , through your choice , will be left behind . 
they become slums , &quot; he said . 
such tough talk might lead to a backlash and Goh could lose more votes this time , some analysts said . 
&quot; If this election proves anything , it might show us whether local issues really are as important as the PAP hopes they are , &quot; said Bruce gale , an analyst with the Political &amp; Economic Risk Consultancy . 
&quot; Or whether people are going to be angered by this tactic and say , why should we be bullied ?
