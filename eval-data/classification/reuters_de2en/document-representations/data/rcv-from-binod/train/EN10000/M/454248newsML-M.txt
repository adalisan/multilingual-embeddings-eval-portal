German IBIS DAX index was in positive territory on Wednesday evening , but the prospect of further significant gains was ruled out in the near term by a market rendered jittery after a long period of record highs . 
&quot; It &apos;s not particularly hectic out there at the moment , but then these are nervous times . 
we &apos;ve got a meeting of the Federal Reserve next week and the British elections coming up to make everyone jittery , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; The triple-witching later this week also makes the market very superficial and any gains tend to be based on movements in derivatives , &quot; the trader said . 
traders said that weaker performances on Wall Street were also dampening sentiment , but said the current slow-down or correction was &quot; not unhealthy &quot; . 
&quot; People will pick up stocks on the way down , &quot; a trader said . 
among shares in the news was the engineering group PREUSSAG AG , up 15.70 marks at 457.50 marks , as merger mania in the steel / engineering group lifted the share 3.44 percent to 457 marks . 
focus has centred on the steel industry since Fried . 
since then Krupp has proposed cooperation talks with Thyssen . 
the news also boosted Mannesmann AG , which was up 3.37 percent at 644 marks . 
shares in German drugs group Shering rose initially after it revised its sales and profits forecasts for 1997 , but fell amid afternoon profit taking by 45 pfennigs too 156.65 marks .
