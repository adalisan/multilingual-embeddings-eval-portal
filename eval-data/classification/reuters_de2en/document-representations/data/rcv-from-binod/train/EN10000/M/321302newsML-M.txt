Hungarian overnight rates closed above Monday &apos;s levels as yesterday &apos;s tax payments left their impact on the market , dealers said . 
overnight rates finished at 26.50 percent , above the opening levels of 25 percent and also above Monday &apos;s close of 24.50 percent , but below the day &apos;s peak of 27 percent . 
&quot; I think yesterday &apos;s tax payments may have meant a relatively substantial burden for all banks , &quot; said Karoly Barath of Postabank . 
&quot; The impact of tax payments may last for another one day or two . 
another dealer earlier today and Barath also said that tight liquidity has characterised the market recently . 
&quot; Banks &apos; lending activity may have increased , &quot; Barath said , adding this might have resulted in narrow supply .
