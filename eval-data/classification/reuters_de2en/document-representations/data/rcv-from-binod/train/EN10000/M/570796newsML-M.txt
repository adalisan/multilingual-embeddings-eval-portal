Short-dated Australian bond and bill futures were weak going into the lunchtime recess after Reserve Bank governor Ian Macfarlane ruled out a policy easing and warned about wages growth . 
testifying to a parliamentary finance committee Macfarlane said there would be no economic gain from another cut in official interest rates given that the central bank &apos;s revised expectations for growth to four percent for calender 1997 . 
&quot; They are happy with the level of interest rates where they are . 
they see them as conducive to economic recovery , &quot; said David de Garis , treasury economist at ANZ banking group . 
June bill futures eased to around 93.98 , equating to a cash rate of 6.02 percent and just above current 6.0 percent official interest rates . 
falls were heavier among further forward bill contracts with the December position dropping to a low of 93.53 percent at one stage and virtually pricing in a 50 basis point tightening by the end of the year . 
the Reserve Bank also said that recent wages data , which showed annual growth at 4.6 percent , was uncomfortably high and any further acceleration would threaten inflation and need a policy response . 
&quot; Unless wage growth abates , forget a rate cut , &quot; said Hans Kunnen , chief economist at colonial State Bank . 
&quot; They are of the view that previous rate cuts will stimulate activity and they are not going to cut again unless wages growth comes back within their comfort zone . 
the April labour force report was also released , while Macfarlane was testifying , which saw employment rise 37,100 , roughly in line with median expectations , while the unemployment rate stayed at 8.7 percent as forecast . 
Macfarlane said he was relieved to see the employment rise , and saw considerably lower jobless if the expansion continues . 
the local market gave up some ground on its yield differential to the dollar bloc during the morning . 
U.S. and Canadian debt weakened on Wednesday amid poor responses to their respective 10-year note sales . 
the local yield curve continued to flatten sharply .
