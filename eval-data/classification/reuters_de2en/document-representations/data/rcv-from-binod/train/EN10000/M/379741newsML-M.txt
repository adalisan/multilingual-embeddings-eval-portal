Iberian bonds should continue to tread water during the coming week , although downward pressure from the Italian market and forex turmoil could hit prices , dealers said on Friday . 
the differential between Spanish and Portuguese 10-year cash bonds and their German conterparts should remain in a 100 to 120 basis point range . 
the spread between the two Iberian markets will move to flat from Spain &apos;s seven basis points over Portugal . 
but tensions in the foreign exchange markets could make the peseta and the escudo more unstable , delaying any monetary easing and flattening both yield curves . 
&quot; After this week , I guess the market will strictly follow peseta movements . 
fundamentals are good but the currency &apos;s weakness is preventing the Bank of Spain from cutting its rate , &quot; said Valentin Fernandez , economist at Credit Lyonnais . 
despite better-than-expected inflation Spanish data for January , at 0.3 percent monthly and 2.9 percent year-on-year , the Bank of Spain left its key money market unchanged today . 
&quot; January data was really good , but we were not expecting a cut today . 
the money market future contract is pricing in a cut of 25 basis points in one-months time , &quot; said a trader in Fimat . 
an unstable peseta , amid rumours of possible central bank intervention , was cited by dealers as the factor behind the decision of the Bank of Spain to hold its money market rate . 
later today , the market is looking for Portuguese data . 
dealers forecast January consumer prices would rise at around 0.4 percent monthly and 3.4 percent year-on-year from 3.3 percent in December . 
the range runs from 0.3 to 0.8 percent . 
&quot; The market is discounting poor inflation . 
so there is the possibility of a positive surprise , but it &apos;s unlikely , &quot; said Martin Amaru Natu , economist at Banco Essi in Lisbon . 
&quot; In the short end of the yield curve we can experience turmoil if January CPI surprises the market , &quot; admitted Nuno Godinho , economist at Deustche Morgan Grenfell in Lisbon . 
but dealers also said that the Portuguese market is likely to delay its hopes for a monetary easing . 
and that change of sentiment is expected to flatten the yield curve . 
at the same time the longer end will remain stuck . 
&quot; There is no reason for the spread to converge further from these levels , &quot; said Amaru Netu . 
although new benchmarks make comparisons inexact , these spreads hit all time lows of 83 and 80 basis points at the end of January . 
the Italian BTP &apos;s recent instability due to political jitters was also adding pressure to the Iberian markets . 
&quot; Bonos could be affected by falling Btps . 
Italy &apos;s spread over Bunds widened a lot in recent times . 
after that I guess that if the Spanish market moves , it &apos;ll fall , &quot; said Giovani Polastri , ecomist at 4Cast in Londos .
