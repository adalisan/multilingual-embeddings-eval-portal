Russian shares firmed slightly on slow trading on Monday , a United States holiday , but traders saw the market ready for a pickup , though they disagreed on how fast the bull would charge . 
Mosenergo closed at $ 0.98 on the Russian Trading System ( RTS ) after $ 0.9825 at Friday &apos;s close . 
Purneftegaz , which will stay in state-owned Rosneft &apos;s control after a court on Monday refused to return it to former owner holding company Sidanko , eased to $ 2.28 after $ 2.30 . 
Brunswick &apos;s Martin Diggle , who said Monday &apos;s low volumes and slow appreciation were due to the U.S. absence , said trade could pick up quickly . 
&quot; We could see some significant price appreciation this week and going forward for the rest of September , &quot; he said , adding that new institutional money had been placed last week . 
&quot; People can &apos;t use Yeltsin &apos;s health as an excuse for not investing forever . 
he &apos;s not in the best of health , but he is operational , &quot; and the Chechnya conflict appears to be coming to a close , he said . 
but Troika-Dialog salesman Herman Zvezdin , who said Russian commercial banks are showing interest in equities , said the new investment would keep to a trickle . 
&quot; The institutional elephants are waiting for a more civilised market . 
some of them are taking on exposure in Russia to get the feeling for how it works , but there will be no major pickup unless there are significant ( infrastructural ) changes . 
he predicted a gradual pickup in market steam , especially in preferred stocks , where a new market has formed , he said .
