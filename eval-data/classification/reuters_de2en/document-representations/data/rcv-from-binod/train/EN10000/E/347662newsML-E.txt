President Clinton &apos;s tax plan will include $ 80 billion in tax increases over five years achieved by closing corporate loopholes and extending expiring taxes , a congressional aide said Friday . 
administration officials briefed Democrats on the tax proposals which were said to be much the same as those the White House proposed in last year &apos;s budget . 
the money would offset an estimated $ 100 billion in tax cuts through 2002 . 
one of the most controversial would require investment owners to use &quot; average cost basis &quot; to compute capital gains taxes , a more restrictive method of counting stock sold . 
the congressional aide said administration officials briefed Democratic staff on closures of corporate tax breaks which would raise about $ 39 billion over five years . 
however , unlike Clinton &apos;s fiscal 1997 budget , this year &apos;s proposal would not require investors to use &quot; average cost basis &quot; until the law takes effect , the aide said . 
Clinton &apos;s 1997 plan provided for $ 59 billion in corporate loophole closures . 
another profitable tax break for investors , called &quot; selling short against the box &quot; would be eliminated in Clinton &apos;s plan . 
rather than selling stock that is owned , investors are able to sell identical stock they have borrowed with their own stock used as collateral . 
Clinton is also to seek renewal of airport trust fund taxes which expired Dec . 31 including the 10 percent excise tax on tickets . 
the tax also adds 6.25 percent to air cargo bills , adds $ 6 per ticket for international departures and addes 15 cents per gallon to aviation gas and 17.5 cents per gallon on jet fuel . 
Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz , introduced legislation Thursday to extend the tax through December 1997 . 
in addition , Treasury officials said Clinton &apos;s plan would repeal the subsidy multinational companies receive for exports to foreign units . 
as in last year &apos;s White House budget , the plan will also restrict interest deductions companies get from investments in tax-exempt bonds . 
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer , a Texas Republican , found it an &quot; unwelcome &quot; sign that details of the Administration &apos;s tax proposal were given to the public and not to Republicans in Congress , a senior House Republican aide said . 
&quot; Republicans were not informed of any of the information , &quot; the aide said .
