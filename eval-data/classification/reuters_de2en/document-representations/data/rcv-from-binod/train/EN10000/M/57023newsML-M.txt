soaring world oil prices may have peaked for the time being after Iraq on Friday appeared to step back from the brink of all-out confrontation with the United States , oil traders said on Sunday . 
but a resumption of military activity in the region , raising further concerns over a disruption to Middle East oil supplies , could easily propel markets higher again this week , they said . 
London November futures for international benchmark North Sea Brent blend on Friday closed at $ 23.12 , down from Thursday &apos;s peak of $ 24.39 for October oil . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think at this stage that we &apos;ll see dramatically higher prices but Saddam is out of his cage , he appears to be ahead of the game politically and that spells danger for the market , &quot; said Russell Hill , head of trading at oil company OMV in London . 
&quot; I think it &apos;s too early in the game to pick a top for the market . 
we don &apos;t know what is coming . 
trying to second guess Saddam is always very difficult , &quot; said Peter Gignoux , head of brokers Smith Barney in London . 
&quot; Saddam has scrambled the Middle East again . 
it &apos;s a more unstable place than it was this time last year and given a background of rising demand and low stocks in the west , oil prices are going to remain very sensitive , &quot; Gignoux said . 
Iraq on Friday said it would suspend attacks on U.S. and allied warplanes flying over northern and southern Iraqi no-fly zones . 
Baghdad on Saturday said it hoped the decision would help defuse the military standoff with Washington . 
the Pentagon described the move as &quot; encouraging &quot; but continued its military buildup in the region . 
eight U.S. stealth bombers landed in Kuwait on Friday and a second aircraft carrier , with 75 warplanes , was expected to reach the Gulf on Sunday . 
U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry arrived in Kuwait on Sunday after a brief visit to Saudi Arabia in an attempt to drum up support among Washington &apos;s hesitant Arab allies . 
Perry , also scheduled for Turkey on Sunday , said further U.S. military action against Iraq was still a possibility . 
U.S. bombers launched cruise missile attacks against Iraq two weeks ago in retaliation for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein &apos;s military incursion into Kurdish safe havens . 
oil traders said Iraq &apos;s latest move had defused some of the tension that last week drove crude prices to five-year highs . 
but with the antagonists playing a guessing game , oil prices would remain hostage to events in the region . 
&quot; Oil supplies could be disrupted . 
it is possible . 
that is the big fear . 
it &apos;s difficult for the market to come down much while we have this cat and mouse situation in Iraq , &quot; said Hill at OMV . 
&quot; The probability of any real and sustained interruption to oil supplies , in the market &apos;s mind , is minimal . 
but the fact of the matter is that events in a whole region responsible for supplying a major portion of world supplies are uncertain and that &apos;s going to keep the heat under oil prices . 
Iraq &apos;s Gulf neighbours Saudi Arabia and Kuwait contribute a combined ten million barrels per day ( bpd ) of the world &apos;s 70 million bpd of supplies . 
Saudi Arabia controls most of the world &apos;s unused capacity . 
any Iraqi move against Kuwait , victim of an invasion by Baghdad in 1990 , would send prices spiralling again . 
diplomats , however , think Saddam is unlikely to attempt a repeat given his massive military disadvantage against U.S. forces in the region . 
hard-pressed oil buyers already are having to cope without the 600,000 barrels a day of Iraqi crude expected back on the market by about now as a result of an oil-for-food exchange arranged by the United Nations in May . 
the accord , designed to raise cash for humanitarian supplies in Iraqi , was put on hold when the latest crisis erupted . 
Washington &apos;s difficulties in rallying support from Russia , some key NATO allies and much of the Arab world for fresh attacks on Iraq is only likelty to add to market uncertainties . 
&quot; It probably gives Saddam more leeway to make trouble on a more frequent basis , &quot; said OMV &apos;s Hill .
