the underlying rate of inflation in Britain rose to 3.0 percent in July from 2.7 percent in June , official figures released on Tuesday showed . 
the Office for National Statistics said retail prices were unchanged last month for a year-on-year increase in the headline inflation rate of 3.3 percent after 2.9 percent in June . 
British inflation rate rises to 3.0 PCT in July 
the July figures were slightly higher than economists had forecast and the price of British government bonds eased back on the news . 
analysts said the rise in the inflation rate appeared to reflect measures included in last month &apos;s budget , the first by the new Labour government . 
the retail price index excluding the impact of indirect taxes fell 0.5 percent last month , for a year-on-year rise of 2.2 percent , unchanged from June . 
the core inflation rate is well above the government &apos;s target of 2.5 percent , but economists said the latest rise did not necessarily point to another rise in interest rates . 
after the last 1 / 4 point increase in British interest rates last week , many economists believe the cost of borrowing may have peaked -- at least for the time being .
