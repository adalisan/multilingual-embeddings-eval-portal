Lebanon on Tuesday condemned Israel &apos;s occupation of southern Lebanon and said it has proved to be the Jewish state &apos;s Vietnam . 
&quot; The Israeli occupation of the south is a very negative situation for Israel , &quot; Foreign Minister Faris Bouez told reporters . 
&quot; The south is a real Israeli Vietnam , actually ... , &quot; he said in reference to America &apos;s troubled involvement in southeast Asia in the 1960s and 1970s . 
&quot; The only way for the Israelis to stop this problem is to fully evacuate , to fully withdraw from southern Lebanon . 
Israel and the South Lebanon Army patrol a 15-km ( nine-mile ) deep border zone inside Lebanon with the declared aim of preventing guerrilla attacks on Israel &apos;s northern border . 
Bouez &apos;s remarks came a day after Lebanese militiamen led by pro-Israeli Christian commander Antoine Lahd shelled the southern port city of Sidon . 
they acted in response to a roadside bomb that blew up a car -- killing two teenage children of a Lahd aide who himself died in a similar blast four years ago . 
the shelling killed seven civilians and raised fears that escalating violence in south Lebanon would undermine a 1996 ceasefire agreement between Israeli forces and pro-Iranian Hizbollah ( Party of God ) guerrillas . 
Hizbollah fighters rained scores of Katyusha rockets on northern Israel on Tuesday , prompting a threat from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of a tough Israeli response . 
Bouez accused Netanyahu of trying to sabotage Middle East peace agreements . 
&quot; He is trying to end , or to terminate the Oslo agreement and at the same time he is trying to change the nature and the goal of the eventual mission of ( U.S. ) Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ... trying to talk about security and not hear about politics , &quot; he said .
