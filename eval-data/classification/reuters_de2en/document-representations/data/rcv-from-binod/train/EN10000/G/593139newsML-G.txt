tiger Woods , in his first 
tournament since his spectacular triumph at the Masters , won 
the $ 1.8 million Byron Nelson classic by two strokes on 
Sunday . 
the 21-year-old mega-star struggled with his swing , but a 
two-under-par 68 was good enough to carry him to his fifth 
professional last August . 
today 
the tournament record low score . 
fellow American Lee Rinker , who led by two strokes after 
seven holes , shot 68 to finish second on 265 , while eight-time 
major winner Tom Watson ( 67 ) tied for third with Dan Forsman 
( 70 ) on 267 . 
this year , moved to the top of the money list with $ 1,290,350 
and jumped to the top of the American Ryder Cup rankings . 
he also took his career earnings to $ 2,080,944 , passing 
the $ 2 million barrier far quicker than anyone else ever . 
but perhaps the most impressive thing about the win was 
that it was achieved with a faulty swing , which is the sign of 
a great player . 
&quot; I hit some really good shots and some really bad shots , &quot; 
Woods said . 
&quot; I had to rely on my mind and my short game to get 
me through and that &apos;s what happened . 
everytime . 
Woods was so concerned about his swing after the third 
round that he summoned coach Butch Harmon , who jumped into his 
car for the four-hour drive from Houston . 
Harmon arrived in the wee hours of Sunday morning , and 
spent time with his star pupil on the range before the final 
round . 
the session did not work miracles , but it was enough to 
carry Woods to victory . 
he started the final round with a two-stroke lead , and 
made his lone bogey at the par-four third , where he sliced his 
drive into water . 
Rinker , playing two groups ahead , birdied three of the 
first seven holes to open a two-stroke lead , but he could not 
hold it . 
with a bogey at the 15th , he handed the lead back to 
Woods , who had five holes left , and it was as good as over . 
Woods Tees up again on Thursday at the colonial tournament 
in nearby Fort worth , where he also is expected to meet with 
fuzzy Zoeller . 
at the Masters , Zoeller made comments about Woods that 
were perceived by many to be racially-insulting . 
the two have 
not spoken since .
