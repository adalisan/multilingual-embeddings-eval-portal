a steeply rising U.S. trade deficit with China is likely to be a major source of friction with Beijing despite recent efforts by U.S. officials to play down differences and smooth out relations . 
the monthly trade report released Wednesday by the Commerce Department shows the U.S. trade deficit with China may be heading for a new record and analysts said they expect to see that trend continue over the next few years . 
&quot; I think with China you are probably headed for new records I would guess for the next two or three years , &quot; said Greg Mastel , vice president of the Economic Strategy Institute , a Washington think tank . 
the Commerce Deparment report showed the U.S. trade deficit with China rising to nearly $ 29 billion during the first nine months of the year , compared with $ 25 billion during the same period last year . 
the trade gap could top $ 40 billion this year , up from $ 34 billion last year . 
imports of toys and clothing for the holiday shopping season are likely to add significantly to the U.S. trade imbalance with China during the last three months of the year . 
the U.S. deficit with China is second only to that with Japan , which reached $ 60 billion last year . 
some analysts believe that China will soon replace Japan as the source of the United States &apos; largest trade deficit . 
the rising gap is likely to figure in Congressional debates next year on China &apos;s Most Favored Nation trade status , which allows Chinese goods into the country at the same tariffs as goods from most other countries , analysts said . 
it is also likely to weigh on the minds of lawmakers as they cast an eye over administration negotiations with China on its bid to enter the World Trade Organization . 
a bipartisan letter to President Clinton from Sen. Jay Rockefeller , D-W.Va. , and eight other members of the Senate Finance Committee , questioned China &apos;s trade practices and whether they are consistent with the rules of the global trading body . 
&quot; In order to maintain the integrity of this rules based system , China must not be permitted to enter the WTO on special terms or to derogate from the WTO &apos;s fundamental requirements , &quot; the Senators wrote . 
&quot; To do otherwise , and admit China permaturely , would seriously erode the credibility of the WTO and greatly harm U.S. economic interests . 
the letter was sent to Clinton ahead of his meeting on Sunday with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Manila , Philippines . 
it is taking place on the sidelines of a gathering of Asia-Pacific leaders . 
in preparation for the meeting U.S. officials have sought to play down past differences and concentrate on areas of cooperation . 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said at a news conference Tuesday following a meeting of the U.S.-China Joint Economic Committee that differences between the two countries were inevitable but that they should not be allowed to sour overall relations . 
he said the rising trade gap with China is due in part to production shifting from Japan and other Asian countries as manufacturers seek to take advantage of less expensive Labor . 
Mastel said that Beijing &apos;s policy of requiring foreign investors to export a significant portion of their production is also a major cause of the deficit . 
much of that production is aimed at the lucrative U.S. market . 
Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli , speaking through interpreter at the press conference Tuesday with Rubin , blamed the huge deficit on difference between the two countries in calculating the source of imports and on U.S. controls on some technology exports . 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher , who was in Beijing Tuesday , announced Wednesday that the United States may allow U.S. companies sell some types of nuclear technology to China for peaceful purposes .
