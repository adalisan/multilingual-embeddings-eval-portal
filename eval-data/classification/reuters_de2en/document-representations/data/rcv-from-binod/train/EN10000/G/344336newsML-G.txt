Germany &apos;s environmentalist Greens called on parliament on Thursday to back their draft law to ensure Jewish Holocaust survivors living in eastern Europe receive the same benefits as their counterparts in the West . 
Volker Beck , the Greens legal spokesman in parliament , presented the first reading of the bill aimed at approving full compensation for about 13,000 Jewish Nazi victims , who had been excluded from remuneration during the Cold War . 
he said the German government had set money aside for them but this only amounted to a maximum of 1,000 marks ( $ 609 ) in one-off payments until the end of their lives , while those living in Germany received about 500 marks a month . 
&quot; There are still many Jewish victims of the Nazis living today in eastern Europe who have not received any compensation -- particularly those living in countries with which Germany still has no bilateral agreements , &quot; said Beck , citing Romania , Bulgaria and the Baltic states . 
&quot; Holocaust survivors must leave their native country for the West if they want to receive reasonable compensation from Germany for their suffering . 
this is politically and morally unacceptable , &quot; Beck told the lower house . 
but Heinz-Juergen Kronberg of Chancellor Helmut Kohl &apos;s Christian Democrats said he felt Jewish Holocaust survivors in east Europe should receive more , but that such payments could not be justified in the present climate of financial austerity . 
&quot; At a time when we are all talking about cutting social and welfare benefits it doesn &apos;t seem the right time to talk about giving millions of marks in more compensation , &quot; Kronberg said . 
he said Germany had set aside 1.5 billion marks for Jewish Holocaust survivors in Poland , Russia , Ukraine and Belarus and argued that these individual hard currency payments went a long way in the poor economies of the former eastern bloc . 
Germany has paid about 100 billion marks in compensation since the war for victims of Nazi injustice . 
last year Kohl launched a series of measures to tighten public spending , stretched by record post-war unemployment , and rein in the budget deficit to qualify for European monetary union .
