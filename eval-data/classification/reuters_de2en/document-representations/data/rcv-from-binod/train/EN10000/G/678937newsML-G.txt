an Israeli woman was injured in the West Bank on Sunday when her car overturned after it was stoned while passing a Palestinian village in the Hebron area , security sources said . 
they said the woman was taken by ambulance from the road near Sourif village to a Jerusalem hospital for treatment for mostly light wounds . 
tensions in the West Bank have been on the rise over a three month deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian peace moves and Israel &apos;s expansion of Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank , including Arab East Jerusalem . 
clashes between stone-throwing Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops raged all week in Hebron , where 400 Jewish settlers live and study in fortified enclaves in the heart of the city of 100,000 Arabs . 
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat &apos;s self-rule Authority said in a sharply worded statement released on Saturday that Israeli settlement expansion in areas captured by the Jewish state in 1967 had spurred the unrest and warned that patience on the Palestinian streets was wearing thin . 
&quot; The arming of Jewish settlers and the protection offered to them by Israeli soldiers while they continuously attack Palestinian landowners will not leave our masses any choice but to confront these aggressions using all available means , &quot; the statement said . 
Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai called on the Palestinian Authority to do more to curb confrontations , saying that unrest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip will lead to casualties mainly on the Palestinian side . 
&quot; I hope that the Palestinian Authority and other forces in the area will use their influence to prevent unnecessary confrontations which will cause casualties mainly on the Palestinian side , &quot; Mordechai said . 
Palestinian police refrained from intervening in the Hebron clashes during most of the week . 
PLO officials have said the Authority was not ready to enter into a conflict with its people while Israel is expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank , Gaza and Arab East Jerusalem .
