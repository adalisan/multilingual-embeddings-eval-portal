Kenya &apos;s President Daniel arap Moi has blamed the opposition for violence this week in which nine people died and lambasted Western nations for urging dialogue to end the political stalemate . 
the opposition on Friday denied the charge and blamed Moi &apos;s government for the disturbances . 
&quot; Our friends telling us about democracy have no moral authority to tell us to do things which they do not . 
a set of double-standards of democracy have been established for each country by the Western world , &quot; Moi said on state Kenya Broadcasting Corporation ( KBC ) late on Thursday night . 
&quot; The opposition is responsible for the violence . 
we also know that they were responsible for the violence in 1992 ( in the runup to landmark pluralist elections ) , &quot; Moi added . 
official parliamentary opposition leader Michael Kijana Wamalwa said he had told Moi dialogue was the only solution to the clamour for constitutional reforms and blamed Moi &apos;s government for the violence . 
&quot; I have written to the president urging him to carry out his official duty and confer with me and other opposition leaders on these urgent matters of national importance and extend true dialogue to the rest of the country , &quot; Wamalwa said . 
the Kenyan shilling took a further battering on jitters in the market , with bids of up to 61 to the dollar at opening on Friday compared to 55 at the start of the week . 
Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka , in comments broadcast by KBC television , warned foreign missions to keep out of Kenya &apos;s internal affairs because Kenyans would solve their problems on their own &quot; without foreign meddling &quot; . 
Nairobi newspapers trumpeted Moi &apos;s stand but also said the calls for changes to level the playing field would continue . 
&quot; As it becomes more obvious that negotiations are the only way out of this stalemate , the ( ruling ) KANU ( Kenya African National Union party ) and the government appear unmoved , &quot; the independent Daily Nation newspaper said in an editorial . 
&quot; It is in the interest of all Kenyans that dialogue be pursued with regard to constitutional reforms -- now and not tomorrow , &quot; the editorial added . 
nine people were killed in Kenya on Monday during the most violent clashes between police and protesters since a violent campaign in July 1990 that helped persuade Moi to allow multi-party politics . 
three straight days of unrest broken up by riot police had prompted a total of 20 countries to press Moi &apos;s government to open dialogue with opposition-backed groups demanding constitutional reforms before elections due this year . 
the United States joined 13 European Union member states , the European Commission , Canada , Cyprus , the Czech Republic , Japan , Norway and Switzerland in condemning the violence and urged the government to start talks with pro-reform groups . 
Reformists want the repeal of six laws from colonial times including the Public Order Act used to regulate public gatherings . 
they also demand free access to state-controlled media , particularly radio , and changes in the electoral law . 
there was no sign that the 73-year-old Moi and ruler for 19 years , would heed the appeals from Kenya &apos;s principal donors . 
opposition parties , human rights and church groups in the National Convention Executive Committee ( NCEC ) had said they will do all possible to change Kenya . 
on Thursday , Kenya &apos;s protestant churches issued a statement calling for an immediate start to the constitutional reform process and saying Moi must take full responsibility for the violence this week .
