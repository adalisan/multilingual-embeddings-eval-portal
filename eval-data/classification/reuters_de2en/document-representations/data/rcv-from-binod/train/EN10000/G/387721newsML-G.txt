Peruvian rescue workers had recovered the bodies of 47 people by Wednesday and were searching for at least 150 more people feared buried under a mudslide that swept away two remote Andean villages . 
&quot; Up to the moment , we have 47 people , &quot; Fanny Vivanco , a worker at the Abancay mayor &apos;s office which is coordinating the rescue operation , told Reuters by telephone . 
she said that most of the bodies , mutilated by stones carried in the torrent of mud , were unrecognizable . 
an Andean mountainside in southeast Peru collapsed before dawn on Tuesday and the villages of Ccocha and Pumaranra at its foot were deluged by a torrent of mud and rocks . 
as President Alberto Fujimori flew to the area , Civil Defence chief Gen. Homero Nurena arrived in the nearby city of Cuzco to direct operations assisted by 300 soldiers , and to evacuate other villages threatened by heavy seasonal rains . 
&quot; We are going to be evacuating people from the area who are in danger , &quot; Nurena told Reuters on arrival at Cuzco airport . 
authorities in Abancay , capital of the stricken Apurimac department , said 33 deaths had been confirmed by the time darkness , fog and further small landslides forced rescuers to call off the search for more bodies under the mud late Tuesday . 
Abancay fire service Capt. 
Felix Vivanco Velasquez said : &quot; There could be 150 to 180 bodies buried under the mud . 
&quot; Congressman Dennis Vargas Marin , who comes from the area and flew there to assess damage , said as many as 350 people had disappeared . 
after a delay because of early morning fog on Wednesday , scores of firemen , soldiers , police and volunteers resumed the grim task of finding bodies before the mud dried . 
rescue workers pulled dozens of bodies from the mud , many mutilated . 
&quot; There were arms , heads , pieces of bodies sticking out of the mud , &quot; said one firefighter . 
&quot; We have tried to dig up the bodies using picks and shovels , but it &apos;s been difficult . 
two other nearby villages , Kerapata and San Jorge , have been evacuated because of the risk of mudslides and Abancay was on alert because of the threat of collapse of snowfields in high mountains above the city which could cause further mudslides . 
local leaders called on the government to declare a state of emergency for the devastated area . 
there were people weeping and trying desperately to move the mud , &quot; Lt. Manuel Gonzales , of the region &apos;s military authority , said . 
&quot; We are taking tents and food now for the more than 100 people who have nothing . 
civil Defence was sending 18 tonnes of supplies including food and blankets to the region as well as three dogs to help find bodies . 
flash floods , mudslides and landslides , known locally as &quot; huaycos &quot; , are common in Peru &apos;s Andes during the January-March rainy season . 
but Congressman Jubert Chavez Serrano , who also flew to the scene , said : &quot; It &apos;s the worst tragedy of this kind we have seen in many years . 
we had some big &apos; huaycos &apos; 20 or 30 years ago , but never like this . 
the tragedy comes on top of five deaths from flooding in Tamburco this weekend and three in the jungle province of Rioja where at least 750 families &apos; homes were swept away by floods . 
in one of the worst disasters in Peru &apos;s history , an earthquake in 1970 set off land movements that buried 70,000 people in the Andean town of Yungay and its surrounding areas .
