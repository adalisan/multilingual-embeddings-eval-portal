the outlook is favourable for economic growth and inflation in Australia in 1996 / 97 , the Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) said in its annual report . 
the central bank said it expected good growth in business investment , a recovery in the housing market during 1996 / 97 , and a further expansion in household spending . 
&quot; On balance , these factors should help to deliver a growth rate sufficient to make modest inroads into the current unacceptably high level of unemployment , &quot; the RBA said . 
&quot; The immediate outlook for inflation is favourable , &quot; the bank said .
