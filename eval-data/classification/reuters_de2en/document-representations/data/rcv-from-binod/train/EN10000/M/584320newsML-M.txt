June gilt futures on LIFFE will drift lower toward support around 113-24 on Wednesday , dragged down by a weak U.S. market and hesitant ahead of data on both sides of the Atlantic , analysts said . 
&quot; The market is getting overbought , &quot; said Norman Beauchamp , head of derivatives at Cooperative Bank in London . 
&quot; It has had a very good rally and we &apos;ve got key numbers both in the UK and the U.S. &quot; 
British data includes March average earnings and April unemployment data as well as unit wage costs at 0830 GMT . 
Beaucahmp said initial support would come in at 113-24 , the high on May 6 . 
the June contract was registering a relative strength index of 75.43 percent on Wednesday , well above the 70 percent level that gives an overbought reading . 
Beaucahmp said initial support would come in at 113-24 , the high on May 6 . 
below there , the top of the value area on May 7 around 113-13,14 would act as support . 
he added there was a trading void on the charts in the last several days from 114-07 to 113-00 and that area would eventually have to be filled in . 
&quot; Stochastics are about to roll over . 
we &apos;re all looking for a sell signal but it &apos;s slow in the coming , &quot; the trader said . 
he said he was looking for the market to make a new low for the week below 113-28 .

Beauchamp at Cooperative also said the market had formed a top at the recent highs .
