the United States and South Korea will hold joint military exercises this month to test their preparedness against threats from North Korea , a U.S. military spokesman said on Monday . 
the annual manoeuvres , codenamed Ulchi Focus Lens , would feature computer-simulated war games and focus on command post exercises , he said . 
about 16,500 U.S. military personnel and tens of thousands of South Koreans will take part . 
the exercise , scheduled for August 18-29 , will coincide with the South Korean government &apos;s command post exercise between August 18-23 . 
&quot; The Ulchi Focus Lens is designed to evaluate and improve combined and joint coordination , procedures , plans and systems necessary for the conduct of contingency operations of the Republic of Korea and the U.S. government in the defence of the Republic of Korea , &quot; a statement by the U.S. military said . 
Seoul officials said the exercises had long been planned and had nothing to do with four-nation talks to be held in New York on Tuesday . 
the Tuesday meeting , involving officials of the two Koreas , the United States and China , is aimed at setting a date , venue and agenda for talks to hammer out a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War . 
North Korea last year described Ulchi Focus exercise as an &quot; act which renders the situation of the Korean peninsula strained and drives it to the brink of crisis &quot; . 
the joint Ulchi Focus exercise has been carried out every year since 1976 , but in March Seoul and Washington cancelled larger military exercises , Team Spirit , in a goodwill gesture to nudge North Korea towards the four-party peace talks . 
the once-annual Team Spirit has been a major source of inter-Korean friction , with the North calling it preparation for an invasion . 
the drill was last held in 1993 . 
&quot; The Combined Forces Command &apos;s preparedness is an effective deterrent to external aggression and serves as the foundation for diplomatic efforts to achieve peace and stability on the Korean peninsula through dialogue , &quot; the U.S. statement said . 
about 37,000 American servicemen , backed by 655,000 South Korean military personnel , confront communist North Korea &apos;s 1.1 million-strong army across the world &apos;s last Cold War frontier .
