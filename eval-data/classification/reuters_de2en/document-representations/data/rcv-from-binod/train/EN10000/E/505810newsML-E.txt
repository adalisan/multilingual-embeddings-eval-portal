-- GDP growth is forecast on average to slow to just 2.6 percent in 1998 , ensuring Britain escapes an economic crash landing which has bedevilled its economic cycle over the past 25 years . 
-- The survey found an average core inflation forecast of 2.7 percent in 1997 and 3.0 percent in 1998 -- not far above the government &apos;s target and probably acceptable to policy makers after a long period of sustained economic growth .

by end-998 , analysts predicted the pound would stand at 1.5800 dollars and 2.5000 marks , the average showed . 
-- The mean of forecasts showed the gilt / Bund spread is expected to fall to 157 basis points by end-1997 from current levels around 185 basis points . 
by end-1998 , expectations of a rise in Bund yields will see the gap narrow to 118 basis points .
