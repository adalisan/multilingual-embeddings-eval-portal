the Polish government sent Deputy Transport Minister Tadeusz Szozda on unpaid leave on Monday after he drove into the country from Russia without stopping at a passport checkpoint , PAP news agency reported . 
the agency quoted Deputy Prime Minister Roman Jagielinski as saying that Szozda would stay on leave pending the result of prosecutors &apos; investigations into the incident on Friday . 
Szozda and several other top ministry officials were in two government cars which failed to stop at passport control on the border with Russia &apos;s Kaliningrad enclave and were only halted , deep inside Poland , after an hours-long police operation . 
finally several police vehicles blocked the road and set up spiked barriers near the northern town of Nidzica , before halting the cars and taking them back to the border . 
tests showed the drivers of the cars were sober . 
Szozda told a news conference that the cars had driven slowly through the border control but had not stopped because there did not seem to be any border officials present . 
PAP said Szozda denied newspaper reports quoting his companions as saying they had failed to notice the checkpoint . 
&quot; We could see the checkpoint perfectly clearly , we were holding our passports , but there were no officials , &quot; he said .
