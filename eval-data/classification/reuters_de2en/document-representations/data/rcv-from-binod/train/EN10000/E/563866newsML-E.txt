British inflation would have accelerated closer to four percent than to three percent by the end of 1998 without Tuesday &apos;s corrective steps , including a quarter-point interest rate rise , a senior government aide said . 
he said the economic information made available by the Treasury to incoming Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown pointed to the need for a tightening of monetary policy without delay . 
the aide disclosed that Brown and his advisers had been working for months on plans to give the Bank of England operational independence over interest rates . 
he said a draft of the letter sent on Tuesday to Bank of England Governor Eddie George setting out the new institutional arrangements was presented to top Treasury officials on Friday morning , hours after Labour &apos;s landslide election victory . 
the final decision to implement some of the most sweeping changes to the Bank of England since 1694 , was taken on Sunday night at a meeting attended by Brown , Prime Minister Tony Blair , Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook . 
the aim of requiring the Bank of England to support the government &apos;s growth and employment objectives , without prejudice to its aim of delivering price stability , was to ensure the central bank did not become &quot; overzealous &quot; in its use of monetary policy -- either in the direction of either higher or lower interest rates , the aide said . 
he said Brown &apos;s proposed legislative changes did not go far enough to to meet the Maastricht Treaty &apos;s requirements for monetary union . 
for that , the Bank of England would have to have the independence to set its own inflation target , he explained . 
Bank of England Governor Eddie George &apos;s contract , which runs until 1998 , will not be amended to include a New Zealand-style requirement to hit the government &apos;s inflation target , the aide said . 
Britain &apos;s representative at the International Monetary Fund in Washington will remain accountable under the new arrangrements to Brown , who will also continue to give instructions to Britain &apos;s representative on the European Union &apos;s monetary policy committee , he added .
