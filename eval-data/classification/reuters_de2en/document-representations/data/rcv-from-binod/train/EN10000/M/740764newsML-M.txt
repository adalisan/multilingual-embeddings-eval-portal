Hong Kong stocks are expected to drift lower on Friday after HSBC Holdings closed easier in London and buyers take a breather , brokers said . 
&quot; HSBC jumped so sharply recently and , with a number of covered warrant issues on the stock launched on Thursday , profit-taking is expected today , &quot; said Peter So , deputy head of research at Schroder Securities . 
on Thursday , the Hang Seng Index soared 260.27 points , or 1.69 percent , to a record close of 15,706.29 on HSBC &apos;s strength . 
HSBC &apos;s surge in Hong Kong was prompted by expectations of good earnings when the bank announces its interim results on August 4 , brokers said . 
&quot; The Hang Seng &apos;s performance very much depends on HSBC these days , &quot; said Antony Mak , sales director at Vickers Ballas . 
selective buying was expected in individual H-shares and red chips , while property counters should move sideways on a lack of good news , Mak said . 
the Hang Seng London Reference Index eased 64.10 points , or 0.41 percent , to 15,642.19 on Thursday .
