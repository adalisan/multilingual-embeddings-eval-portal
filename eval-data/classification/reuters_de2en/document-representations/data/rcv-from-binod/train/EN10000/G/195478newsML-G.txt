former presidential candidate Bob Dole made a guest appearance on NBC-TV &apos;s &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; , joking that he had a new job , but that his impersonator on the programme was out of work . 
&quot; I got a job answering phones down at the Red Cross , &quot; Dole told the live studio audience . 
&quot; My wife pulled some strings . 
&quot; Hello , Red Cross . 
how may Bob Dole direct your call ? 
Elizabeth Dole , who heads the Red Cross , was in the audience , flashing a thumbs up sign . 
dole , a 35-year veteran of Congress , lost his bid to unseat President Clinton in the Nov . 5 election -- but not his sense of humour . 
poking fun at comic norm MacDonald , Dole said it was too bad he wouldn &apos;t be able to play the president for the next four years . 
&quot; If it &apos;s any consolation , norm , the impression isn &apos;t that great . 
dole joked about MacDonald &apos;s impression of the Kansas Republican , including a skit about Dole &apos;s tumble off a campaign podium during the campaign . 
but he got the most laughs with a line poking fun at his own use of the third person to refer to himself in campaign stump speeches . 
&quot; I don &apos;t run around saying Bob Dole does this and Bob Dole does that , &quot; Dole said . 
&quot; That &apos;s not something Bob Dole does . 
that &apos;s not something Bob Dole has ever done , or that Bob Dole will ever do .
