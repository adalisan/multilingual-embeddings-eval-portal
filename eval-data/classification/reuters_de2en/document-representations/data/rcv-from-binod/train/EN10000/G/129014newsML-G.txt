President Boris Yeltsin has brought in a tame replacement for ousted troublemaker Alexander Lebed , hoping to calm the tensions threatening stability as he prepares for heart surgery next month . 
Rybkin &apos;s appointment on Saturday followed a week of high drama in Moscow , in which Lebed was accused of plotting a creeping coup to take power from the ailing president by force . 
Russia &apos;s loyal and moderate new Security Council chief and peace envoy to breakaway Chechnya strikes a sharp contrast with his ambitious and outspoken predeccessor , fired on Thursday for rocking the boat . 
on Sunday Rybkin , scorned by Lebed as an incompetent bureaucrat , won cautious approval from the Chechen separatists , who had previously seen Lebed as the only hope for a permanent end to 21 months of bitter fighting over the southern region . 
&quot; We are ready for cooperation and close working contacts with Ivan Rybkin and any Russian official sincerely interested in the re-establishment of stable peace in the region , &quot; rebel security chief Akhmed Zakayev told Itar-Tass news agency . 
troops were continuing their withdrawal from Chechnya , Interfax news agency said , in line with the peace plan signed by Lebed in August which was condemned by many in Moscow as a sell-out to the rebels . 
Rybkin has pledged to stick to the deal but his ability to keep the warmongerers at bay is not the only question mark hanging over Russia , where Lebed stirred up a good deal of dust during his brief spell in the byzantine corridors of power . 
by drawing attention to the parlous state of Russia &apos;s armed forces , the former paratroop general upset the establishment but won fans in the military , which is badly split and demoralised . 
in a letter to a liberal opposition newspaper a group of General Staff officers told the cash-strapped defence ministry to pay off wage arrears by this Friday or face the consequences . 
military analysts have ruled out a mutiny , saying the army is too divided and its leaders too timid , and Lebed dismissed the Interior Minister &apos;s charge that he was planning a coup . 
but Lebed has brought tensions in the armed forces to the surface -- two top officers have been replaced in the past week , one for insubordination -- highlighting a potential flashpoint . 
on the political front , much now depends on Yeltsin &apos;s own future , which will become clearer next month when doctors have said he will undergo heart surgery to correct a heart problem which has laid him low for nearly four months . 
Yeltsin &apos;s incapacity fuelled the Kremlin infighting which led up to Lebed &apos;s sacking . 
if the surgery is delayed , or goes wrong , it may split Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and chief of staff Anatoly Chubais , currently allied against Lebed . 
many analysts feel Yeltsin has furthered Lebed &apos;s plans to replace him as president by sacking him so unceremoniously in an obvious echo of his own ousting by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987 which marked the start of his rise to power . 
Gorbachev on Saturday became an unlikely champion of the general , who might find himself standing against Chernomyrdin in a future poll and appears isolated from the powerful backing which helped him come third in June &apos;s presidential election . 
Lebed would have tackled crime and corruption if he had not been blocked , Gorbachev told Interfax , adding that he had offered a glimpse of chaos and panic in the Kremlin . 
Lebed chose a visit to the theatre to start his fight for a political comeback -- a fight more complicated than Yeltsin &apos;s because Russians , preoccupied with everyday survival , are no longer so keen to rally behind those who oppose the status quo . 
the play &quot; Death of Ivan the terrible &quot; depicts a world of cloak-and-dagger intrigue at the 16th century court of the dying tsar as noblemen jostle for power , including the ambitious young Boris Godunov who eventually takes over . 
&quot; I &apos;ve learned how not to run a country , &quot; Lebed told the hoards of journalists at the theatre , making it more than clear that he saw himself as Godunov .
