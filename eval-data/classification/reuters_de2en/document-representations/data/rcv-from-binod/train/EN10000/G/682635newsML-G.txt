U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Ronald Asmus met Lithuanian diplomats on Tuesday to discuss a charter which Washington hopes will assuage the Baltic states &apos; fears at being left out of NATO . 
the charter contains no security guarantee , which the Balts desperately want as they remain suspicious of Russia , but is aimed at convincing them that the United States sees them as fully-fledged members of the West and does not want them to be isolated . 
Asmus visited Estonia on Monday and will also visit Latvia . 
&quot; This charter is a statement of shared values , principles and the common vision that we have of a new , free , democratic , undivided Europe , &quot; Asmus told a news conference . 
he said the charter would be a politically but not legally binding document signed at the highest level possible . 
&quot; It might be signed , perhaps , in the autumn , &quot; Asmus said . 
all three Baltic states quit the former Soviet Union in 1991 and want cast-iron guarantees that they will never again come under the control of Moscow . 
but they are expected to be left out of a first stage of NATO expansion , due to be launched at a summit in Madrid in July , as Russia &apos;s objections to their inclusion are too strong . 
Asmus would not say what would go into the charter , but said Washington would prefer to sign with all three Baltic states at the same time rather than country by country . 
a next round of talks is expected in Washington next week .
