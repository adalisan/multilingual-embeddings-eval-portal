Zairean rebels said on Sunday that Lubumbashi , the country &apos;s second largest city and the site of copper and cobalt mines , was the next target of their advance . 
&quot; Lubumbashi is the next big target ... but all the towns of the republic are targets including Kinshasa itself , &quot; rebel information commissar Raphael Ghenda told journalists in the eastern border town of Goma . 
Lubumbashi , close to the Zambian border , is the capital of Shaba region and has long been a centre for opposition to Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko . 
Ghenda confirmed reports on rebel radio that the lakeside town of Pweto , 400 km ( 250 miles ) northeast of Lubumbashi , had fallen to troops of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire ( ADFL ) . 
&quot; Pweto fell two days ago and the forces have gone even further , beyond Pweto , &quot; he said . 
regional military sources said rebels took Pweto with little fighting because government troops were afraid of their advance and popular anger directed against them by residents . 
the Alliance led by Laurent Kabila scored its biggest victory to date on Saturday in the war to topple ailing Mobutu by taking the eastern city of Kisangani , the base for a failed government counter offensive . 
Ghenda said Kabila was expected to visit Kisangani on Sunday . 
the rebels , whose campaign started in South Kivu &apos;s Uvira last October , moved north to take Goma in November and Bunia in December before fanning west to attack Kisangani from several directions . 
at the same time the advance headed south towards mineral-rich Shaba region seizing control of a string of towns including Kalemie and Moba .
