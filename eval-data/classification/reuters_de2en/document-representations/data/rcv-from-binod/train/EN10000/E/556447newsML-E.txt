Pakistan expects aid commitments of about $ 2.8 billion from foreign donors for fiscal 1997 / 98 ( July-June ) , Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said on Friday . 
he told reporters that Islamabad also expected a higher new credit line from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) under a new so-called Extended Structural Adjustment Facility ( ESAF ) . 
Aziz attended a World Bank-sponsored meeting of a consortium of 14 donor nations and international aid organisations in Paris on April 22-23 and later held talks with the World Bank and IMF officials in Washgington . 
no pledges were made in Paris , where Islamabad asked for fresh consortium commitments of $ 2.268 billion . 
but Aziz said the meeting gave a &quot; very strong endorsement &quot; to the economic reforms programme of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif &apos;s new government . 
&quot; We hope that the total commitments from the consortium sources for 1997 / 98 will be $ 2.8 billion compared to $ 2.2 billion in 1996 / 97 , &quot; he said . 
Aziz said Pakistan planned to begin talks with the IMF in July on concluding a new ESAF loan to replace a standby loan facility suspended in March . 
he said that he hoped the arragement would be finalised by September . 
he said it was for the IMF board to decide the amount of the credit line , but &quot; this can be said that time it may be a little more than a previous $ 1.2 billion ( ESAF ) &quot; , which had preceded the suspended standby facility . 
the previous government of prime minister Benazir Bhutto had promised to redude the budget deficit to four percent of gross domestic product in 1996 / 97 from 6.3 percent in 1995 / 96 as one of the conditions for the suspended standby loan . 
the pledge was reaffirmed by a caretaker government after President Farooq Leghari dismissed Bhutto government in November on disputed charges of misrule . 
Aziz said he could not yet estimate the deficit for the current fiscal ending on June 30 but added that the four percent target was unlikely to be achieved before the present government &apos;s new economic reform agenda made some progress . 
Sharif &apos;s government has announced three packages on economic reforms , export promotion and agricultural revival after taking office in February . 
it plans to bring three more package on banking and tax administration reforms and downsizing the government and state-run corporations . 
&quot; If you take all these six packages together , this will be the most far-reaching and fundamental agenda of our economic history , &quot; Aziz said .
