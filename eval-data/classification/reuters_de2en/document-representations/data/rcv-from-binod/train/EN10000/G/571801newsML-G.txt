more than 1.4 million acres ( 600,000 hectares ) of Colombian forest are being razed every year by drug traffickers and poor farmers planting illegal coca and poppy crops , a senior police official said on Friday . 
&quot; The impact of drug trafficking on the environment is clear and serious , &quot; said Col. Leonardo Gallego , head of the anti-narcotics division of the National Police . 
&quot; The natural resources of the jungles and Andean forests are being devastated , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We have to put a definitive end to this , once and for all , because a disaster is occurring in Colombia , &quot; he added . 
Gallego , who spoke at a forum on the environmental impact of the drug trade , did not how the statistics were obtained . 
the anti-narcotics division regularly overflies forested areas of Colombia seeking drug plantations and clandestine drug laboratories used to make cocaine and heroin . 
Gallego stressed that many of the forest areas cleared for use as drug farms never reach the planting stage because police and military authorities keep a close watch on them once they have been spotted from the air . 
according to the most recent statistics from the National Police , no more than about 148,000 acres ( 60,000 hectares ) of drug crops , including marijuana , are currently believed to be planted across Colombia .
