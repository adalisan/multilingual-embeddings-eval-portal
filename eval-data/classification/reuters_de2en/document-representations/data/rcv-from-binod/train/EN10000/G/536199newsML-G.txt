Switzerland will return 3.2 million Swiss francs ( $ 2.2 million ) to Mali that the west African state &apos;s authorities say was stolen by ousted former dictator Moussa Traore , Swiss justice officials said on Thursday . 
it will be the first time that Switzerland has handed over money from a toppled head of state based on claims by a successor government that the cash was put aside criminally , Berne &apos;s Federal Police Agency said . 
&quot; As far as cases of former heads of state go , it is the first time , &quot; agency spokesman Folco Galli said . 
Galli confirmed a report in the Swiss news magazine Facts that the money would be repatriated soon , after a final ruling by the Swiss supreme court in March . 
legal wrangling has stalled efforts to return fortunes put in Swiss bank accounts by Philippines strongman Ferdinand Marcos , ousted in 1986 , and by Haiti &apos;s Jean-Claude &quot; Baby Doc &quot; Duvalier , overthrown the same year . 
Mali &apos;s new government asked Switzerland to freeze and return funds after the military ousted Traore in 1991 and paved the way for multi-party democracy . 
&quot; The money involved here came from embezzlement , corruption and other criminal acts , &quot; police spokesman Galli said . 
the Federal Police Agency , which looks after Switzerland &apos;s response to requests for international legal aid , ordered the accounts frozen in September 1991 after the new Mali government pledged to offer a formal request , which followed in November .
