Turkey &apos;s Islamist-led coalition looks set to survive its fifth parliamentary challenge in as many months , underscoring the inability of mainstream secularists to put forward a government formula of their own . 
analysts say opposition parties appear incapable of mobilising the 276 votes needed in the 550-seat parliament when a censure motion against Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan is considered on Tuesday . 
&quot; The opposition is not opposing , &quot; said one senior Western diplomat . 
passage of the motion would bring down Erbakan &apos;s 10-month-old government , an uneasy partnership between his Islamist Welfare Party and the conservatives of U.S.-educated Tansu Ciller . 
the two control 278 seats between them . 
the censure vote follows a string of defeats last week , when parliament voted not to impeach Ciller for alleged corruption while head of the previous cabinet . 
anti-government forces fell short by 19 votes in their best showing . 
analysts and politicians say this repeated failure is all the more glaring , given Turkey &apos;s officially secularist system , strong backing from the officer corps , and growing unease within society at Islamist policies . 
President Suleyman Demirel , whose role is mostly symbolic , has tried to compensate for the lack of a strong opposition . 
&quot; I urge the free media , the free judiciary and politicians to come and protect Turkish democracy and the Turkish republic , &quot; he said in an interview with the Milliyet daily published on Monday . 
Demirel voiced rare criticism of Islamists last week . 
a series of Islam-based proposals , including the lifting of a ban on Islamic headscarves for female government workers , has alarmed the secular public and upset the powerful armed forces . 
most were later withdrawn or toned down . 
even the defection of 17 MPs from Ciller &apos;s True Path Party -- leaving her with 118 -- has failed to turn the tide . 
Mesut Yilmaz , laconic leader of the main opposition motherland Party ( ANAP ) , has proved largely ineffective and is subject of a budding leadership challenge . 
and a bitter feud between rival leftist parties has further complicated the search for a formula that would exclude Erbakan and his Islamist Welfare Party . 
MP Cemil Cicek , in remarks to the mass-circulation Sabah daily , issued a thinly-veiled call for Yilmaz to step down for failing to lead the party of late president Turgut Ozal back to power . 
&quot; In the West political leaders are convergent and make concessions . 
ours are quarrelsome , provacative , gossipy and splittist , &quot; Cicek said . 
&quot; In the West you stay in your job if you win and do well . 
you go if you lose . 
here you stay whether you win or not . 
divisions on the left have also plagued the campaign to replace Erbakan with a government more in line with modern Turkey &apos;s secularist vocation . 
a proposal to unite the Republican People &apos;s Party and the Democratic Left Party was shot down late last week by Bulent Ecevit , leader of the Democratic Left and former prime minister . 
&quot; Even if the whole world wanted it , I would not unite ( with the Republican People &apos;s Party ) , &quot; Ecevit declared . 
the failure of the secularists to oust Erbakan , who captured a plurality of just 21 percent of the vote in the last general polls , has drawn the armed forces into the political limelight . 
three times in the last 36 years the military has stepped in to domestic politics , deposing elected governments . 
earlier this month the general sent tanks into an Islamist district to express their concern for the direction of the country .
