European vegetable oil prices were mixed at midday on Monday ahead of the Chicago opening . 
&quot; The market is nervous this morning with most people waiting to see what happens next in Chicago , &quot; said one trader . 
traders said for once there was some genuine concern over the weather patterns in the U.S. Midwest . 
&quot; In the past we have had all kinds of stories coming out of Chicago about the crop and people have lately been ignoring them , but this year they seem to be taking more notice , &quot; said one . 
traders added the next 48 hours hold the key to the market for this week . 
if the Midwest gets a good soaking prices are expected to fall sharply , but if rainfall is only spotty then a rally is expected around mid-week . 
however , the firm dollar will also have its part to play , limiting any down side movement in Europe . 
Malaysian private forecaster Ivan Wong &apos;s latest crop report had little impact . 
Wong forecast an increase of five percent in local palm oil output during July while stocks were projected at 865,000 to 875,000 tonnes at end-July against PORLA &apos;s end-June figure of 786,123 . 
data released after the Malaysian futures market closed by cargo surveyor SGS put exports n the July 1-20 period at 444,956 tonnes against 369,494 during June 1-20 . 
traders said an increase in exports would normally be expected to trigger a rally , even if short-lived , on the Malaysian market , but a lot depended on how Chicago performs . 
at midday Dutch soy oil was one guilder up to 0.50 down while rape oil was one guilder higher to 0.25 guilders lower . 
crude palm oil CIF Europe sellers were unchanged to $ 5 down after Aug traded at $ 495 a tonne CIF . 
RBD palm oil was unchanged to $ 2.50 after Sep fetched $ 82.50 a tonne fob Malaysian ports while olein $ 2.50 down in a tradeless market . 
palm stearin offers were unchanged after Aug traded at $ 365 a tonne fob Malaysian ports . 
Lauric oils were quiet with sellers unchanged to $ 5 up with buyers around $ 15 below the asking prices .
