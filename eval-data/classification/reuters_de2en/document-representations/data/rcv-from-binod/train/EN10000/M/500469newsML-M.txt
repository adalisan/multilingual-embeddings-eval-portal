a Western High grown broken Orange Pekoe tea invoice fetched a record 234 rupees per kg at this week &apos;s Colombo auction , the brokers involved in the transaction said on Thursday . 
&quot; This is the highest on record so far this year for a Western High grown BOP grade , &quot; Eastern brokers said in a statement . 
the line of tea from Mattakelle Estate , Talawakelle , was bought by Unilever Ceylon Ltd , it said . 
&quot; The price obtained was unusually high at this time of the year , &quot; a broker said . 
&quot; This year we have not seen the quality peaking during the Western quality season ( from early March to end April ) because the weather has been very dry . 
the previous high for the same type of tea this year was 204 rupees per kg at the March 12 auction for a line of tea made by St. Coombs Estate in the same region .
