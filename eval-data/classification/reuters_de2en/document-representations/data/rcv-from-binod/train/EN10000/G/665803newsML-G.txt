Frenchman Emmanuel Collard will test drive for the Prost Grand Prix formula one team at Magny cours this week , heightening speculation that he will replace the injured Olivier Panis . 
Collard , a former test driver for Williams , Benetton and Tyrrell , has been linked with a future role at the Prost outfit since the start of the season . 
Panis , who suffered multiple fractures to his legs when he crashed during Sunday &apos;s Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal , is not expected to race again this season . 
the Prost team said in a statement on Tuesday that while Collard would test drive this week , a decision on Panis &apos;s replacement for the French Grand Prix on June 29 would not be taken until &quot; a later date &quot; . 
former F1 drivers Martin Brundle and Jean-Christophe Boullion have also been linked with the Prost drive .
