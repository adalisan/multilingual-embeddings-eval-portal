&quot; No one &apos;s really taking any particularly big bets ahead of that ( FOMC meeting ) . 
also , this morning the CPI numbers which came out for Canada were benign , &quot; said Michael Gregory , a fixed-income economist and strategist with Lehman Brothers Canada Inc .

Canada &apos;s unadjusted July consumer price index rose 1.8. percent in the year , Statistics Canada said Tuesday . 
economists in a Reuters survey had forecast a 1.8 percent year-over-year rise in the all-items index and a 1.9 percent increase in the core CPI . 
analysts said the data was likely to push back the timing of a second Bank of Canada rate hike this year , which would likely weigh on the Canadian dollar . 
&quot; They were much better from an inflation standpoint than expected and I think that has cast some doubt over certain near-term prospects for the Canadian dollar , particularly in the wake of Monday &apos;s sluggish manufacturing report , &quot; said Gregory . 
&quot; ( The reports ) suggest there &apos;s no sense of urgency for the Bank of Canada to move rates up .
