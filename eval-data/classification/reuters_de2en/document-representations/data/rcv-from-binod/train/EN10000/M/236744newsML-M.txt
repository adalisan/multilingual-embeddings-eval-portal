Colombian stocks edged up amid signs of revived demand from foreign funds , brokers said Thursday . 
Bogota &apos;s IBB index gained 0.19 percent to close the day at 843.17 in a 1.55 billion peso volume while Medellin &apos;s IBOMED index rose 0.24 percent to 13,279.52 in a 939.6 million peso volume . 
&quot; Some foreign funds seem to be anticipating a rise in prices before the end of the year and so they decided to go out and buy today , albeit timidly . 
there were quite a lot of cross-deals and interest in the banks tailed off , &quot; one Bogota trader said . 
the Bogota exchange saw a 483 million peso deal in insurance company Suramericana de Seguros , part of the powerful Sindicato Antioqueno conglomerate . 
its price remained unchanged at 18,500 . 
there were also deals in Banco Ganadero preferential shares , unchanged at 180 amid a 185 million peso volume and in cigarrette manufacturer Coltabaco , unchanged at 3,000 . 
demand drove brewing giant Bavaria up 0.02 percent to 4,100 in a 377 million peso volume on the Bogota exchange and supermarket chain Cadenalco gained 1.12 percent to 810 after a disastrous session Wednesday . 
&quot; Foreign funds are most interested in buying shares that have recently fallen and then wait for them to rise again . 
that strategy is quite effective in terms of profits , &quot; another broker said . 
Banco de Bogota fell back 0.31 percent to 5,981 and Banco Industrial de Colombia dipped 1.44 percent to 3,400 . 
brokers said demand for both was very thin . 
in Medellin , Cadenalco made up some of the previous day &apos;s loss , climbing 1.25 percent to 810 . 
cement manufacturer Cementos Argos gained 0.93 percent to close at 5,300 . 
Coltabaco was unchanged at 3,000 .
