the Federal Reserve is expected to inject reserves into the banking system on Monday through a round of multi-day system repurchase agreements , analysts said . 
predictions ranged from two-day system RPS to 10-day system RPS , although analysts said three-day system RPS are most likely since there are three days left to the current two week maintenance period . 
the RPS are seen for fixed collateral . 
analysts project a $ 1.5 billion add need left for the remainder of the period . 
a recent $ 5.1 billion , 10-day system operation remains outstanding , although Wednesday &apos;s $ 6.9 billion five-day system RPS run off this morning and needs to be replaced , analysts said . 
the Fed stayed out of the open market on Friday . 
Federal funds are steady , opening at the 5-1 / 4 percent target rate and trading at that level thus far this session .
