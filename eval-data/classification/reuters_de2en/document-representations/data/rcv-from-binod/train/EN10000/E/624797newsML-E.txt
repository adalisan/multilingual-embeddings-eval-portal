expectations of strong first quarter Australian economic growth received a setback on Thursday with the release of data showing that consumption , one of the key factors driving growth , may have actually worked to hold down the final growth figure . 
after a poor December quarter , consumption rebounded strongly in the quarter ended March 31 and is expected to be a key contributor to first quarter gross domestic product ( GDP ) . 
but that same consumption has meant companies have run down stock levels dramatically , possibly because they underestimated the strength of demand , which means that business stocks will now make a negative contribution to GDP , analysts said . 
the level of business stocks , or inventories , fell by 2.1 percent in the March quarter , the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported . 
this contrasted with median forecasts of a 0.5 percent rise and the December quarter rise of 1.0 percent , and was the first time stocks had fallen since the September quarter of 1993 . 
&quot; It &apos;s a case , with the stocks numbers , of being bad for historic growth but good for future growth , &quot; HSBC Markets economist Anthony Thompson said . 
the change in the level of stocks feeds through to GDP calculations . 
when stock levels grow by less than in the previous quarter , or as in this case actually fall , it means they will detract from that quarter &apos;s growth . 
&quot; I think the important point though is that with a lot of sales having been met through stock rundowns , it &apos;s important to also look at spending , and that was certainly a lot stronger in the March quarter -- private spending we estimate was up 2.2 ( percent ) , &quot; ANZ Treasury economist David de Garis said . 
forecasts for GDP were being revised down from a median of around 1.1 percent , although quarterly balance of payments data on Friday is needed before final forecasts can be made . 
&quot; It was a bigger fall than we &apos;d expected , but you can explain it as partly due to the increase in demand and partly due to the overhang in stocks from the previous quarter , &quot; Bankers Trust Australia senior economist David Bassanese said . 
&quot; GDP for the quarter now looks like coming in under one percent , &quot; he said . 
but against that , if , as many economists think , the fall in stocks was due to the strong consumption demand and therefore could be considered involuntary , it augurs well for growth prospects later this year . 
if business is confident of the stronger demand continuing , they will have to lift production to meet the demand and also to build back up stock levels , analysts said . 
this should then feed through to stronger overall economic growth . 
&quot; With inventories being run down a little it sets the groundwork for a pick-up later in this year , as as the economy picks up they will have to re-stock , &quot; Citibank Australia chief economist Stephen Koukoulas said . 
&quot; It &apos;s consistent with the view that the economy will have to be a little bit stronger , &quot; he said . 
however , as stocks had been rising so strongly since their last fall , analysts said that it was possible businesses may allow stock levels to unwind further , meaning there was still potential for stocks to make a negative or weak GDP contribution next quarter as well .
