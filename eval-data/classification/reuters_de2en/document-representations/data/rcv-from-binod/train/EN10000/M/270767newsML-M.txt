Brazil - The Guaxupe Coffee Cooperative on December 19 released a statement estimating Brazil &apos;s 1997 / 98 ( May / April ) coffee crop at no more than 20 million 60-kg bags . 
the cooperative cited studies showing a combination of cyclical production patterns and climatic alterations were behind the low estimate . 
agronomist Jose bras Matiello said those trees unaffected by the 1994 frost had shown high production for the 1996 / 97 crop . 
he said this fact - plus unusual warm and dry winter months - had left trees &apos; tired &apos; leading to a likely fall in 1997 / 98 yields . 
Matiello added that the spring rains of July / August 1996 had arrived earlier than usual . 
he said this led to robust vegetable growth but disappointing flowering and cherry formation , especially in the south of Minas Gerais . 
Colombia - Colombia &apos;s coffee production in calendar year 1997 will increase to 12.8 million 60-kg bags compared to the 11.6 million bags harvested in 1996 , Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo said . 
he added exports in 1997 will be 11.6 million 60-kg bags in line with the ACPC retention scheme . 
national Coffee Growers Federation chief Jorge Cardenas said it was too early to put an exact figure on production for calendar year 1997 but predicted a minimum of 12.5 million and a maximum of 12.8 million bags . 
Colombia &apos;s coffee inventories currently stand at 6.2 million bags . 
the stocks will be cut by about 500,000 bags to meet 1997 export commitments , Ocampo said . 
a drop in inventories will reduce the projected deficit of the coffee fund which was recently estimated to be about $ 400 million in 1997 . 
however , Ocampo said that the figure could probably be less than $ 150 million . 
Thailand - Coffee production in 1996 / 97 ( October / September ) will be sharply below earlier expectations . 
the total is now expected to reach 1.033 million bags from around 1.357 million bags forecast earlier because of heavy rains , industry sources said . 
production in 1995 / 96 was put at 1.313 million bags . 
it was said that the outlook for coffee exports is bleak as world prices are not satisfactory and production costs of Thai coffee are much higher than those in Vietnam .
