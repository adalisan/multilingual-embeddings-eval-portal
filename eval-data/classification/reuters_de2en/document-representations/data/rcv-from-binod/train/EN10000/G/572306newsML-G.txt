Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied on Friday U.S. reports of a possible Israeli spy scandal in Washington as baseless . 
&quot; There is no basis to the reports that were given ... I say to you with authority Israel does not activate agents in the United States , &quot; Netanyahu told Israel Channel Two television . 
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno confirmed on Thursday an investigation was underway involving an intercepted conversation suggesting Israel may have an intelligence source who can obtain sensitive U.S. information . 
Reno declined to give any details of the investigation . 
Netanyahu said Israel was cooperating fully in the U.S. investigation . 
&quot; I instructed our people that are affected by the matter to cooperate with their counterparts , &quot; Netanyahu told Israel Channel One television . 
the Washington Post reported on Wednesday the investigation was launched in January after the National Security Agency intercepted a secure communication between a senior Israeli intelligence officer in Washington and a superior in Tel Aviv . 
the newspaper said the communication referred to someone codenamed &quot; Mega &quot; and an attempt to obtain a sensitive American document , a letter from then U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat . 
Israeli media and experts blamed on Thursday a misunderstanding over the codename &quot; Mega &quot; for the scandal . 
Israel &apos;s Haaretz newspaper said Mega was apparently a mistaken decoding of &quot; Elga &quot; -- an old Israeli intelligence word for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency . 
Netanyahu , when asked if it bothered him that the FBI listened to Israeli Embassy telephone conversations , said : 
&quot; usually every sane diplomat , in every state where there are Israeli diplomats , has to assume that the difference between a telephone and microphone is not great . 
the last major spy case involving the United States and Israel occurred 12 years ago . 
Jonathon Pollard , a Jewish U.S. Navy intelligence officer , was arrested for passing secrets to Israel . 
he is serving a life prison sentence . 
the FBI in February said agents seized computers , financial records and other documents from the home of a Detroit tank engineer suspected of having divulged U.S. military secrets to Israel for the past 10 years .
