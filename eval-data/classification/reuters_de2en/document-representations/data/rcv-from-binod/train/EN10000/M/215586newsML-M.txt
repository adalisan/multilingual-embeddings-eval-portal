Hong Kong &apos;s Hang Seng Index scored a record close on Monday , taking its cue from Wall Street &apos;s shattering of more records on Friday and buoyed by continued bullish sentiment in the property market . 
the index closed 122.60 points higher at 13,239.39 after setting a record intraday high at 13,261.25 . 
&quot; Obviously it is on the back of New York on Friday , &quot; said Miles Remington , sales trader at Crosby Securities . 
&quot; Property is still the main word in Hong Kong &apos;s stock market at the moment , &quot; he added . 
the Dow Jones Industrial average closed 53.29 points higher at 6,471.76 on Friday , the 42nd record closing high for 1996 . 
Howard Gorges , director at South China brokerage , said Hysan Development &apos;s acquisition of the entertainment Building in Hong Kong &apos;s Central district for a rich price had allowed the recent market rally to broaden out to property investment companies . 
&quot; It has been another stimulus for the market , &quot; he said . 
&quot; A revaluation of property within Central is certainly boosting some of the stocks , &quot; said Remington . 
Gorges also noted a strong tone in banking stocks . 
they were leading the market up then they went into quite heavy profit-taking . 
it looks like they have stabilised , &quot; said Gorges . 
he said the rotation from one sector to another may prevent a large correction in the Hong Kong market . 
&quot; I would imagine that we can &apos;t go up in a straight line . 
pretty soon I would expect the market to consolidate a bit but the undertone of the market through the last 10 days has been very strong so I don &apos; t think one can bet on a big correction , &quot; Gorges said . 
but Remington said the 13,200-point area seemed to be towards the top of the trading range in the short term . 
shares in Shanghai Industrial jumped HK $ 1.65 to HK $ 22.85 following news that the company would acquire various automotive , infrastructure , food and commercial interests .
