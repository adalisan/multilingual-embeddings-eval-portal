Afghanistan &apos;s unstable power balance has tilted again , this time against the Taleban zealots who for a few fleeting days last week seemed close to their goal of imposing their rigid Islamic rule over the whole country . 
their black-turbanned fighters had advanced across the northern heartland of Uzbek opposition leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum , with the help of rebels in Dostum &apos;s ranks . 
local people and opportunistic commanders were hoisting white Taleban flags in town after town in the few northern provinces still outside the militia &apos;s control . 
about 3,000 Taleban fighters rolled into the northern capital of Mazar-i-Sharif from the northwestern province of Badghis after Dostum had been forced into exile in Turkey . 
a similar-sized force burst across the strategic Salang Pass that links north and south Afghanistan to take the town of Pul-i-Khumri and advance into Samangan and Baghlan provinces . 
the Taleban , who captured Kabul in September , appeared to have gained control of up to 90 percent of Afghanistan and were rewarded when Pakistan and Saudi Arabia became the first countries formally to recognise their government as legitimate . 
the opposition seized on the hasty recognition and the sudden arrival of the Pakistani ambassador in Mazar-i-Sharif as proof of their long-held conviction that the Taleban are a U.S.-backed creation of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia . 
Pakistan again denied that it favoured the Taleban , whose advance had set off alarm bells in Iran , Russia and the Central Asian republics on Afghanistan &apos;s northern border . 
Uzbekistan reinforced its border , blocking and fortifying the so-called Friendship Bridge across the Amu Darya river , apparently fearing a Taleban attack or a refugee influx . 
the mainly ethnic Pashtun Taleban then suffered a series of reverses as stunning as their earlier gains . 
their Uzbek allies , resenting the Taleban &apos;s high-handed behaviour in Mazar-i-Sharif , changed sides and helped the Shi &apos;ite Moslem Hezb-i-Wahdat militia to boot them out of the city on Wednesday after a bloody , 15-hour street battle . 
renowned guerrilla chief Ahmad Shah Masood &apos;s ethnic Tajik fighters broke out of his Panjsher Valley fiefdom to capture the key town of Jabal-os-Siraj , 70 km ( 44 miles ) north of Kabul , at the foot of the Salang Pass through the Hindu Kush mountains . 
that dealt a double blow to the Taleban , effectively isolating their forces north of the Hindu Kush and those in the Ghorband Valley to the west , who had been trying to force a way across the Shibar Pass to the Shi &apos;ite-held city of Bamiyan . 
by Sunday , Shi &apos;ite Hezb-i-Wahdat fighters were reported to be advancing in Wardak province , west of Kabul . 
a Western military analyst in Islamabad said the Taleban , with their greater cohesion and sense of divine purpose , remained the most powerful force in Afghanistan , but last week &apos;s rapid setbacks had clearly caught them by surprise . 
diverse opposition forces , he said , were fighting by instinct , rather than with any overall plan of action , and might find it hard to forge any lasting joint strategy . 
&quot; The first side to wilt logistically and in purpose , direction , leadership and coordination will lose , &quot; he said , adding that a decisive outcome was unlikely . 
&quot; This will go on for some time , &quot; he predicted . 
the analyst , who asked not to be named , said the Taleban , aware of their present danger , were pouring reinforcements to their frontlines , but many of them were raw recruits . 
&quot; They know the Koran and one end of a Kalashnikov from another , but that &apos;s about all , &quot; he said of the new fighters . 
he said Masood had superior tactics , but his chances of destroying now-isolated Taleban forces depended on his supplies of ammunition , fuel and rations , as well as his men &apos;s morale .
