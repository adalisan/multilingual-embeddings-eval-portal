Israel has not implemented the latest phase of a programme to liberalise processed-food imports on January 1 as scheduled , a Treasury spokesman said on Monday . 
under the phased-in programme , duties on processed foods were due to fall by one-seventh on January 1 . 
but the spokesman said the committee in charge of setting the exact terms had not completed them . 
he said he did not know when the new , lower duties would go into effect . 
the next phase of the liberalisation will also need cabinet approval . 
under World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) regulations , Israel removed administrative barriers on imports of processed foods from January 1 , 1996 . 
in addition , Israel undertook unilaterally to lower customs over seven years . 
the liberalisation covers all processed foods except bakery goods , coffee and chocolates and is aimed at bringing the base customs rate to eight percent in the year 2002 .
