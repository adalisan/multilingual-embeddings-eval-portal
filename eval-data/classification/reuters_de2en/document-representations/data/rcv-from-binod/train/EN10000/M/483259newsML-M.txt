June Bund futures on LIFFE on Wednesday will attempt to fill a gap from last week &apos;s close of 99.79 as the German market is encouraged by firmer U.S. treasuries , but the upside is limited , analysts said . 
&quot; What we saw yesterday was a new test of very significant support around 99.28 , &quot; said ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett technical analyst Geert-Jan Nikken in Amsterdam . 
&quot; For the moment it seems that support holds , &quot; he said . 
&quot; What we are facing now is only slightly higher prices . 
they had left a gap from Thursday &apos;s 99.79 low to Tuesday &apos;s 99.70 high . 
Nikken said if the market filled that gap there were new selling opportunities , with good resistance at 99.85 to offer another stumbling block . 
John Ratcliffe , senior money market analyst at Technical Data in London , agreed that 99.79 was the initial goal . 
&quot; It &apos;s got a bit more upside , &quot; he said . 
he said a steep downtrend since late February comes in around 100.00 . 
he did not see that level as a serious obstacle but rather as a potentiallly positive indicator if the market got above it . 
&quot; I certainly can &apos;t get too enthursed about the whole thing until 100.54 gets exceeded , &quot; Ratcliffe said , noting a March 26 high . 
Nikken said there was scope for a new attempt on Tuesday &apos;s important 99.26-28 floor . 
&quot; However we will find some support at 99.52 , &quot; he said , noting that was a low on March 20 and also a level where the market found resistance on hourly charts during its bounce on Tuesday . 
Ratcliffe said he would not get immediately bearish unless the market went below Tuesday &apos;s lows .
