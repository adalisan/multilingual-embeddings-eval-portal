the United States reacted cautiously to Iraq &apos;s promise to stop firing at allied warplanes on Friday , pressing ahead with a build-up of forces in the Gulf and an initiative to gain international support . 
after President Bill Clinton &apos;s top national security advisers met at the White House to map out the next moves in the showdown with Iraq , administration officials spoke of a bid for broad-based international support for military moves . 
defence officials said Defence Secretary William Perry would visit the Gulf region to discuss the Iraq situation , and administration officials said he was expected to leave shortly for Turkey , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and Bahrain . 
after two weeks of tension between Baghdad and Washington , a spokesman for Iraq &apos;s ruling Revolutionary Command Council said attacks on U.S. and allied warplanes patrolling no-fly zones would stop as of midnight local time ( 2000 GMT ) . 
&quot; Saddam Hussein knows what has to happen if he &apos;s going to step back from the brink of this problem , &quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said . 
&quot; He has to stop his aggression . 
he has to stop his military movements which have posed an unacceptable risk to the United States and to our partners , &quot; he told reporters . 
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters that it would be &quot; encouraging &quot; if the Iraq declaration that it was halting attacks on allied planes was followed by action . 
he added : &quot; However , we will continue to move forces into the region as necessary to protect our interests . 
with further military strikes being considered virtually inevitable around Washington , White House officials said Clinton would not be rushed and was taking time to build support among reluctant allies and the American public . 
&quot; He wants to build a consensus . 
it &apos;s important , &quot; one official said in noting that the president was willing to defer an immediate strike briefly in order to strengthen its diplomatic and political underpinnings , especially this close to the November 5 U.S. presidential election . 
officials said Clinton was expected to meet with his senior advisors at the White House Friday night to formalise a plan . 
earlier in the day they met without Clinton , led by Secretary of State Warren Christopher , Perry and White House National Security Adviser Anthony Lake . 
White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said that , &quot; as to international support , we &apos;ve worked very hard to create that kind of support , to continue to remind governments of the threat that Saddam Hussein poses in the region . 
&quot; But I would remind you ... that we have leadership responsibilities in this world , and if we need to act alone , if necessary , we will act alone , &quot; McCurry said . 
as the spadework proceeded , a U.S. military buildup in the Gulf region continued as well . 
eight sleek , radar-dodging stealth warplanes arrived in Kuwait and a second U.S. aircraft carrier , the Enterprise , steamed toward the Gulf . 
with the exception of the British , most allies have been tepid at best in their support for the two cruise missile attacks Clinton ordered last week in retaliation for military action by Baghdad against Kurds in the north . 
since then , Iraqi forces have fired on American warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones in both northern and southern Iraq and efforts have been made by Baghdad to repair some of the southern air defence batteries damaged in the missile attack . 
a Pentagon official said eight F-117A stealth fighters , designed to drop laser-guided bombs while avoiding Iraqi radar , arrived in Kuwait from the United States on Friday after a 20-hour non-stop flight . 
four U.S. B-52 bombers with cruise missiles have already rebased to the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia , and the aircraft carrier Enterprise was steaming south in the Mediterranean en route to the Gulf with some 75 warplanes . 
the carrier Carl Vinson is already on patrol there .
