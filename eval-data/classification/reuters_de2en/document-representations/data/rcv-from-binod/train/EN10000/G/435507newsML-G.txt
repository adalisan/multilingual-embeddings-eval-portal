former Olympic and world pairs champion Artur Dmitriev and his partner Oksana Kazakova have been restored to the Russian team for next month &apos;s world championships in Lausanne , team officials said on Wednesday . 
Dmitriev and Kazakova were dropped for January &apos;s European championships after finishing fourth in the national trials but earned their recall in Hamilton , Ontario , two weeks ago by coming second and pushing compatriots , current world and European champions Marina Eltsova and Andrei Bushkov , into third place in the Champions Series final . 
Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov , also former world champions , are the pair to be dropped . 
they were fifth at the Europeans . 
Dmitriev won world , Olympic and European gold through the early 1990s with then-partner Natalia Mishkutienok . 
he made a successful comeback with Kazakova to win the European title last year , then they placed fifth in the world championships in Edmonton , Alberta . 
Russia &apos;s third pair in Lausanne will be youngsters Elena Berezhnaia and Anton Sikharulidze , third at the Europeans where their country completed the first-ever sweep by winning all four titles .
