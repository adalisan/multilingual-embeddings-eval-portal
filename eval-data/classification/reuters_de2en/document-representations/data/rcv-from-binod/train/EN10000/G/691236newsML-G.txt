a senior Palestinian official on Thursday called a move in Israel &apos;s parliament to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip a recipe for confrontation . 
a proposed bill , which passed a preliminary reading on Wednesday by a vote of 21-3 , will go to committee and must pass three more readings . 
political sources said it had little chance of final passage in a vote by the full 120-seat Knesset . 
&quot; The draft law proposed to the Knesset regarding annexation of settlements is the beginning of the official policy of annexation and expansion at the expense of all the Palestinian lands , &quot; Palestinian Minister of Information and Culture Yasser Abed Rabbo told Israel Radio in Arabic . 
&quot; This means directing the final blow to the peace process ... This is the path of confrontation between us and it is the road to executing the peace process , &quot; he said . 
Israel has built more than 140 settlements for Jews in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since it captured the areas from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war , but it never annexed the areas except for Arab East Jerusalem . 
under a landmark 1993 peace deal with the Palestine Liberation Organisation , Israel agreed to negotiate a permanent peace settlement that includes the fate of Jewish settlements and Jerusalem . 
Israeli-PLO peace moves have been stuck since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent bulldozers in March to start building a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem .
