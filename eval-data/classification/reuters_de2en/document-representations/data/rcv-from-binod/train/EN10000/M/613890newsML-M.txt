the Indonesian rupiah was stable against the dollar in dull trading on Monday , dealers said . 
they said there was no momentum in the market despite campaign violence which caused the deaths of at least 142 people on Friday in Banjarmasin , South Kalimantan . 
authorities have said that most of the victims in Banjarmasin were looters trapped by flames in a shopping mall which had been set ablaze earlier after riot police and troops began to patrol the streets . 
&quot; The rupiah is surprisingly firm despite the violence . 
there was no reaction at all , &quot; one European bank dealer said . 
&quot; People seem to have no mood to trade , &quot; the dealer said . 
dealers said operators seemed to have been long on dollars in the spot market which made further covering unnecessary . 
they said operators were also long in the forward market , built up recently and from last Friday when foreigners heard Jakarta businesses were closing early on fears of violence . 
spot rupiah was at 2,440.5 / 41.0 at 0900 GMT , compared with an opening of 2,440.0 / 42.0 . 
tomorrow closed at 2,440.0 / 40.55 . 
dealers said the spot rate was traded in a narrow range , betweem 2,440.0 and 2,441.0 throughout the day . 
they said a public holiday in the United States was the other reason for the quiet market . 
one Singapore dealer said earlier people were reluctant to go long further on the back of low Tom / next swap rates . 
dealers said liquidity was ample , with overnight money falling to three percent from 11.0 / 12.0 percent . 
Tom / next was at 0.1 / 0.2 points . 
another dealer said the market was likely to remain stagnant in the run-up to the May 29 general elections . 
&quot; I think people would stay square or slightly long on dollars in the next few days until we have the election , &quot; the dealer said . 
one-month swaps were at 16.5 / 17.5 , two at 29.0 / 34.0 , three at 43.0 / 45.0 and six at 84.5 / 86.0 points . 
the central bank raised its intervention band by one point to 2,413 / 2,605 but lowered its conversion band by three points to 2,416 / 2,464 on Monday .
