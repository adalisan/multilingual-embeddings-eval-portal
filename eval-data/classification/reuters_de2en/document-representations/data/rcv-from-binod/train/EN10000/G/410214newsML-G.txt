some 35 people were hurt on Thursday when a tower holding loudspeakers collapsed at the start of a rock music concert in Chile , officials said . 
police said 20 people were trapped for a time under the debris , but all were rescued and the concert by Deep purple was resumed . 
the tower collapsed under the weight of a crowd that had climbed to see the band , which had only played three songs when the accident occurred . 
the tower fell on top of people sitting at Santa Laura Stadium in the northern part of Santiago . 
there were no fatalities , but officials said some of the injuries were considered serious , with several victims suffering broken bones and concussions . 
officials said concert organisers decided to resume the performance in order to avoid further disturbances if the show was cancelled .
