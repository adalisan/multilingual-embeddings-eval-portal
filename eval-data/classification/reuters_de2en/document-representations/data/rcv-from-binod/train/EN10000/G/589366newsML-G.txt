Jean-Pierre Papin , whose little daughter Emilie suffered brain damage at birth , has helped organise an auction next week of sports memorabilia in aid of handicapped children . 
&quot; ( The parents ) are often on their own , discouraged and haven &apos;t the same financial means as us . 
so , if we can , ( we will ) help them , &quot; the Bordeaux centre forward , whose wife also had a part in creating the Nine of Hearts Foundation , said . 
Emilie is undergoing an American method of treatment that involves great expense and frequent trips to the United States . 
&quot; It &apos;s a restricting method and not a miracle solution ... With Emilie , it &apos;s working . 
she has made enormous progress and I live only for that , &quot; the former France captain said . 
Papin has rounded up sports equipment belonging to leading figures in world sports , travelling to Imola for contributions from racing drivers Jean Alesi and Jacques Villeneuve and also obtaining the late Ayrton Senna &apos;s last helmet . 
jerseys belonging to soccer greats Michel Platini , Roberto Baggio and Eric Cantona and basketball &apos;s magic Johnson , a pair of gloves worn by the late world boxing champion Carlos Monzon and tennis gear from Thomas muster , Stefan Edberg and Mary Pierce will also go under the hammer in a televised auction in Bordeaux on Monday .
