leading European stock markets were boosted on Wednesday by a late burst of activity on Wall Street overnight , which helped the Dow score its second biggest one-day gain ever . 
on the currency front , the dollar made a muted start to the European session , edging lower against the mark and yen after profit-taking overnight knocked it back from Tuesday &apos;s fresh 37-month high of 1.7375 marks . 
London and Paris blue chips pushed around half a percent higher in early trading and German shares were up well over one percent following the dramatic rise in U.S. share values . 
the Dow Jones industrial average ended up 135.26 at 6,587.16 after encouraging U.S. inflation data raised hopes that interest rates might not have to be hiked as steeply as had been feared . 
in London shares were also underpinned by British unemployment figures which , as expected , showed a 41,000 drop in the jobless total in March . 
dealers said volumes were expected to remain light as institutional investors stay on the sidelines . 
&quot; We &apos;ve had a bit of a mark-up but the fund managers still don &apos;t want to do too much , &quot; the head of trading at a major investment house said . 
&quot; There is still too much uncertainty about for the market to go charging forward . 
fears that the opposition Labour Party , the clear favourite to win Britain &apos;s May 1 election , would need to raise corporate taxes in order to shore up fragile government finances was cited as a contributing factor to the FTSE index &apos;s recent thin trading volumes . 
&quot; The market expects the corporate tax burden to go up after Labour takes office but until we see exactly what the tax burden will be , the funds aren &apos;t going to commit themselves , &quot; another dealer said . 
worries that a Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer might agree to a 50 basis point interest rate rise shortly after the ballot in order to establish credibility with the financial markets have also dented investor enthusiasm . 
in Frankfurt the DAX index for bourse floor trading was up 1.1 percent in early trade but dealers said the market was being held back somewhat by the weaker dollar . 
new result details from Daimler-Benz were being viewed positively but not with the same enthusiasm that greeted recent figures from BMW . 
upgrades were nonetheless expected to result from an analyst meeting later in the day , dealers said . 
Daimler &apos;s shares were trading around five pfennigs higher at 138.60 after earlier reaching an all-time high of 142.40 . 
in Paris French shares were up 0.56 percent following the bourse &apos;s 2.12 percent gain on Tuesday . 
currency traders said Tuesday &apos;s surge in the Dow and U.S. Treasury markets failed to hold the dollar above 1.73 marks but it still looked well-supported and speculation on higher U.S. interest rates was still in place . 
&quot; The Dow and bonds surge was purely a domestic reaction to the soft CPI data and seemed a more technical correction of its recent falls , &quot; said a Japanese bank dealer . 
against the yen , the dollar orbited the 126 yen level in morning European business , down from overnight levels amid contuing concern about possible Bank of Japan intervention . 
comments overnight from senior Ministry of Finance official Eisuke Sakakibara , who reiterated official concerns over excessive currency moves , further dampened the upside potential for the dollar / yen rate . 
the dollar was quoted at 1.7250 marks and 126.00 yen after ending at 1.7333 and 126.28 in late trading in Europe on Tuesday . 
gold was quoted at $ 341.50 versus $ 341.75 at the close in London on Tuesday . 
silver was firmer at $ 4.72 .
