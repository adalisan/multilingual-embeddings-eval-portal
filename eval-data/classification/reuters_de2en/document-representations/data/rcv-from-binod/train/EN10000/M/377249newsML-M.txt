Tokyo stocks rallied for the third consecutive day on Thursday , inspired by the weak yen which supported blue-chip buying and Nippon Credit Bank Ltd &quot; s recovery , brokers said . 
wall Street &quot; s record climb was also a supportive factor for the market , they said . 
but brokers said that stock rises were capped on the topside after earlier heavy gains , weighted down by strong profit-taking ahead of corporate book closings in March . 
the Nikkei average of leading 225 issues finished up 278.10 points or 1.51 percent at 18,688.06 , after climbing as high as 18,854.76 at one point . 
its March futures gained 340 points to end at 18,730 . 
&quot; The weak yen provided positive incentives to the market , &quot; said Tim Hayashida , strategist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc , adding that it was expected to help a broader range of stocks , including those of medium-sized firms . 
&quot; The weak yen is the only remedy left for the Japanese economy when the government tightens its fiscal policies , &quot; said Hiroyuki Nakai , chief investment strategist at Nikko Securities Co Ltd . 
Nakai expects the Nikkei 225 to head gradually higher to the 19,000-20,000 range by the end of March . 
Hayashida said selling pressure might limit the topside to some extent until the end of the financial year in March because of profit-taking ahead of book closings and further dissolution of mutual share holdings . 
trading was relatively active , with turnover hitting 548 million shares on Thursday , up from Wednesday &quot; s 457 million . 
gainers outpaced losers 681 to 422 issues , while 146 issues were unchanged . 
in other indices , the broader-based TOPIX index rose 14.36 points or 1.05 percent to end at 1,382.79 . 
the Nikkei 300 average closed up 3.27 points or 1.25 percent at 265.51 . 
key chart points of 18,335 and 18,500 brightened sentiment . 
Thursday &quot; s close was the highest level since January 8 , when the index ended at 18,680.38 . 
the market was also encouraged by buying back of Nippon Credit Bank ( NCB ) shares , which had been hit hard in recent weeks . 
Thursday &quot; s gains were sparked by a Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) official &quot; s remark on Wednesday that public money could be used to protect creditors holding bank debentures . 
buying of NCB shares provided relief to other banking shares , which had been dragged down by concern &quot; s about their 
NCB &quot; s shares ended up 31 yen , or 15.20 percent , at 235 yen , making it the largest percentage gainer . 
its volume of 14,765 million shares was the heaviest on the first section . 
&quot; In the short-term , short-covering is expected to push up NCB shares , &quot; said Akira Takai , an analyst at Daiwa Institute of Research Ltd . 
but he added that after a round of short covering , the shares may stay flat while the market awaits the bank &quot; s business results for fiscal 1996 / 97 . 
major blue-chip issues hit highs for the financial year , with Sony Corp jumping 170 yen to end at 9,070 yen . 
canon Inc gained 120 yen to end at 2,750 yen , Toyota Motor Corp rose 50 yen to end at 3,410 yen , and Honda Motor Co Ltd gained 130 yen to end at 3,640 yen . 
by sector , gainers were led by precision instruments , rubber , credit / lease , electric equipment and machinery . 
the major retreating sectors were electric power , communications , construction , warehousing and oil . 
the second-section index finished up 7.03 points at 1,728.98 , with 8.66 million shares traded .
