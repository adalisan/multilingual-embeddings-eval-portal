it started with a backyard game of catch in the coal-country of southeastern Ohio 50 years ago and ended in Hall of fame glory for knuckleballer Phil Niekro , baseball &apos;s newest forever resident of Cooperstown . 
the knuckleball - fluttery , elusive , utterly unpredictable - was the only pitch father Phil could toss to his son after the coal miner injured his shoulder hurling in a sandlot game . 
the ball danced in mid-air and young Phil missed it . 
&quot; What was that ? 
&quot; he asked his father , who showed him the unorthodox grip , the nails of the index and middle fingers dug into the ball to push it forward with no rotation . 
&quot; I would have liked to be able to throw a Tom Seaver fastball or a Bob Gibson slider , &quot; Niekro , 57 , said Tuesday at a news conference celebrating his election to the Hall . 
&quot; That was my life , the knuckleball . 
that single , baffling weapon was good enough to help Niekro produce 318 major league victories over 24 seasons , spent mainly with the National League braves . 
&quot; There was no question when you walked up to the batter &apos;s box what you were going to get , &quot; he said . 
&quot; All I know is if I could get that around the plate , the batter was going to have a hard time . 
younger brother Joe later joined in the knuckleball games with dad in the backyard - some 20 yards away from the yard of boyhood friend and basketball Hall of Famer John Havlicek - and also rode the trick pitch to a stellar big league career . 
between them , Phil and Joe ( who won 221 games ) combined for 539 wins , the all-time major league record for brothers . 
the knuckleball , which floats tantalizingly until seized with a sudden urgency to drop , dart or sail in any which direction , does not command respect in the macho world of professional baseball . 
&quot; ( Catcher ) Bob Uecker always told me he was the only guy who ever figured out how to catch a knuckleball , and that was to wait until it stopped rolling and pick it up , &quot; Niekro said . 
Niekro seemed to suffer from guilt by association . 
the knuckleball artist stands 14th on baseball all-time win list and his career ranks fifth in longevity but the right-hander had to wait until his fifth year of eligibility to win election to the Hall . 
&quot; Some people just don &apos;t like knuckleball pitchers . 
some managers don &apos;t want to have a knuckleball pitcher on their team , &quot; said Niekro , who also led the National League in losses four times with some bad braves teams , and gave up the most hits and runs for three successive seasons from 1977 . 
Niekro , bitterly disappointed in previous years for failing to get the required 75 percent of baseball writers &apos; votes , this time garnered 380 of 473 votes ( 80.34 percent ) . 
&quot; The first time ( he was eligible ) , I bought a brand new suit , bought brand new ties . 
I was packed and had arrived at the airport , &quot; he said . 
&quot; For three or four years I got pumped up so high , for me and my family . 
Niekro , who now manages the women &apos;s touring Silver bullets baseball team , admitted his excitement over finally getting in . 
Niekro credited two men for turning his career around -- former braves general manager Paul Richards and journeyman catcher Uecker , now a baseball commentator and sometime comedian , who gets a lot of mileage with jokes about his ineptitude as a player . 
&quot; Paul Richards came to Atlanta and traded Gene Oliver from the braves to Philadelphia for Bob Uecker , specifically to catch my knuckleball . 
he led the league in passed balls . 
&quot; He ( Uecker ) was the guy who said , &apos; hey Niekro , you &apos;re going to throw it on a 3-2 count , with the bases loaded , I don &apos;t care what the situation is . 
we &apos;re going to lose games throwing it but you &apos;re going to win more than lose . 
&quot; He &apos;s the guy who really made me believe in myself as far as having someone back there that I really had confidence in . 
Niekro , who threw a no-hitter against the Padres in 1973 , said his greatest moment came when he beat Detroit to enable he and brother Joe to surpass Gaylord and Jim Perry ( 529 wins ) as baseball &apos;s most successful brother act . 
&quot; That was a family win . 
that was really something , my dad being alive to see it and my mother was at the game , &quot; he said . 
&quot; You can have the no-hitter back , you can have it all back . 
that was the most special . 
Niekro struggled to get his 300th win , failing four times to notch the milestone victory and battling spasms in his arm before finally accomplishing the feat in the final game of the 1985 season for the Yankees against Toronto . 
amazingly , Niekro mystified the Blue Jays for nine innings without throwing a single knuckler until using it on the last pitch to strike out Jeff Burroughs to end the 11-0 game . 
&quot; They had clinched the pennant the night before and I don &apos;t know if there were any sober guys on that team , &quot; said Niekro , who became the oldest pitcher , at age 46 , to throw a shutout .
