a growing perception that the Federal Reserve &apos;s policy-making arm would hold off further tightening at its meeting in July pushed yields lower on Friday . 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported May nonfarm payrolls rose 138,000 , far less than economists &apos; expectations of a rise of more than 200,000 -- even given seasanal revisions . 
the data continued to paint a picture of contained inflationary pressure for the U.S. economy , making it politically difficult for the Federal Reserve to justify further tightening of monetary policy . 
Paul McCaulley , chief economist at UBS Securities Inc , said nonfarm payrolls rose at a less-than-expected rate but the number was market neutral as the unemployment rate dropped 0.1 percentage point to 4.8 percent in May . 
McCulley said there was no question the Labor market remained tight and that clearly put the risk to the upside the Federal Reserve would tighten at its July meeting . 
fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has stated that the central bank would move preemptively to control inflation even without overt inflationary statistics should economic growth continue at what is seen as an unsustainable pace . 
the May nonfarm payrolls unemployment rate dropped to 4.8 percent from 4.9 percent in April , a figure McCaulley said was not a fluke . 
&quot; There &apos;s no question that inflation remains benign , but if the Fed remains preempmtive the risk clearly is to the upside , &quot; McCulley said . 
he said retail sales , set for release next Thursday , would be the most important number for the week . 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond was scheduled to release its survey on Tuesday and the Atlanta Fed on Thursday . 
producer prices were slated for release on Friday . 
Michael Englund , economist at mms International , said the next major price movements likely would be based on retail sales data . 
he said 17 out of 25 analysts his firm surveyed now expected no action on short-term interest rates at the Fed &apos;s next meeting in July , with one seeing a 50-basis-point hike . 
last week , 60 percent of those surveyed expected another tightening , he said . 
Englund said economic data had been much stronger than anticipated since the Fed last met and the unemployment rate had shrunk far more than anticipated . 
&quot; It &apos;s obvious the economy will shrink from first quarter growth , but the trend is still strong , &quot; Englund said . 
&quot; We see even stronger numbers in the fourth quarter . 
the Treasury Department said on Thursday it had not yet decided to accept a private-sector advisory committee &apos;s recommendation to cut some sales of 10-year notes . 
talk on Friday was that the government would cut back on 10-year note sales . 
Treasury announced on May 1 that it was increasing sales of the notes to six times a year instead of four .
