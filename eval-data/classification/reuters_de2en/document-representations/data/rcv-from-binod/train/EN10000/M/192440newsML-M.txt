the combined effect of sharp rises of heavyweight Telkom and some banking stocks coupled with the presence of fresh funds boosted the Jakarta index to a sharply higher close in active trading on Friday , brokers said . 
the Jakarta composite Index jumped 15.98 points , or 2.66 percent , to 616.89 points . 
Advancers led decliners by 71 to 40 , with 55 counters unchanged . 
brokers said the market was likely to be mixed next week with some consolidation after big increases in some counters over the past couple of days . 
but some investors had already anticipated they would not get their full subscription and put their money in other stocks over the past two days , &quot; Jordan Zulkarnaen , analyst at PT Pentasena Arthasentosa , said . 
Zulkarnaen predicted the market was likely to stabilise in the coming week with profit-taking in some big-cap counters . 
but brokers said some local investors could be active buying secondaries after they received their BNI subscription refunds next Thursday , November 21 .
