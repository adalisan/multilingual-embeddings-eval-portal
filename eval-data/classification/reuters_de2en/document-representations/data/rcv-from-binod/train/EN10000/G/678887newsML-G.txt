a Philippines citizens group said on Sunday it had collected nearly six million signatures on a petition demanding constitutional change to let President Fidel Ramos run for re-election . 
a convoy of trucks will carry the bales of signatures to the offices of the poll watchdog , the Commission on Elections ( Comelec ) , on Monday in a last-ditch attempt to force a referendum on amending the 11-year-old constitution . 
&quot; They said the people &apos;s initiative is dead . 
we are here to prove we are resurrected , &quot; lawyer Jose Calida of the People &apos;s Initiative for Reform , Modernisation and Action ( PIRMA ) said . 
PIRMA officials said the signatures were collected nationwide and showed Filipinos favoured a second term for Ramos to ensure continuity of his policies to revive the economy . 
the constitution limits a president to one term of six years . 
the Supreme Court on June 10 rejected a petition by PIRMA for a plebiscite to remove the limits on terms of office . 
&quot; The people ( are ) the only deciding factor in this political exercise , &quot; Calida told a news conference . 
&quot; It is not the Supreme Court justices . 
under the law , the Comelec is empowered to call a plebiscite on petitions to amend laws but it is required to verify the authenticity of signatures . 
Comelec earlier said it would accept PIRMA &apos;s petition but it might not act on it because of the Supreme Court &apos;s ruling . 
Ramos , whose term ends in June 1998 , told a news conference in London last week that he would not run for a second term but would continue to act as an elder statesman after leaving office .
