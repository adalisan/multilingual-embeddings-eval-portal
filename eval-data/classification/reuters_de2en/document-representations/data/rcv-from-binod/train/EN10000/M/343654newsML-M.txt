the Polish zloty edged down in light early trade sparked mainly by dollar / mark movements on world markets and the short-term outlook for the local currency remained unclear , dealers said . 
they said the scope of market &apos;s was appetite for zlotys in the near future would likely result from foreign investor moves in or out of Polish treasuries , with the growing trade deficit still neutralised by foreign direct investment inflows . 
&quot; The zloty is tracking the dollar &apos;s moves against the mark with a trend difficult to forsee . 
it seems the market is split , &quot; said Mateusz Bieniek of Societe Generale in Warsaw . 
at 0855 GMT the zloty was quoted at 2.35 / 2.30 percent from the trading band centre , slightly softer than 2.45 / 2.33 percent at 0800 GMT and Wednesday &apos;s close at 2.40 / 2.33 percent . 
it was at 3.0020 / 40 to the dollar , up from 3.0035 / 50 on Wednesday and at 1.8305 / 11 to the mark , down from 1.8290 / 10 . 
dealers said investment inflows , such as German Bitburger &apos;s purchase of a small Polish brewer on Wednesday , may put some upward pressure on the zloty , but central bank intervention expectations would limit its upside to 2.5 percent from parity . 
overnight rates tumbled as banks found excess funds on the last day of the January required reserve period , dealers said . 
&quot; There is a lot of cash but if the central bank offers NBP-bills with an overnight value date , O / N could still rebound later today , &quot; said Maciej Ratulowski of Bank Zachodni SA . 
tomorrow / next were at 21.00 / 21.90 percent versus yesterday &apos;s 21.60 / 21.75 percent . 
dealers said one-day rates should on Friday again straddle the central bank &apos;s main reverse repo rate , at 21.64 percent for 14-days .
