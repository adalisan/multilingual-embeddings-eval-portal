&quot; The market is already registering quite interesting demand for some liquid shares , such as blue chips Slovnaft , Nafta and VSZ , and that &apos;s why we predict higher trading activity , mainly from foreign investors , in the near future , &quot; said Dusan Sykora of ING Barings . 
the largest commercial bank , VUB lost 250 crowns to close at 1,650 , but traded only 20 shares which , brokers said , did not indicate any future trend .
