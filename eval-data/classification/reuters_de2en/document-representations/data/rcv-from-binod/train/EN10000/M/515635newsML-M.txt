Canadian bonds opened weaker on Thursday , underperforming U.S. issues , as a drop in the Canadian dollar and profit taking after gains on Wednesday weighed on prices , analysts said . 
&quot; It &apos;s just a little rebalancing of what had happened yesterday . 
yesterday we outperformed the U.S. with particular interest in the two and five-year area , &quot; said Will Sutherland , vice-president of fixed income with Altamira Investment . 
&quot; We &apos;re going back to Tuesday &apos;s Canada-U.S. spread levels . 
the U.S. 30-year bond rose 6 / 32 to yield 7.08 percent . 
the spread between the two bonds widened to 22 basis points from 20 basis points on Wednesday . 
&quot; The Canadian marketplace was caught without bonds yesterday and it drove prices up , &quot; said Sutherland . 
weighing on the Canadian market this morning was a softer Canadian dollar . 
the unit weakened from the open after the release of the Canadian merchandise trade surplus for February . 
the auction will take place April 23 and will be dated and delivered May 1 . 
the U.S. bond rose 4 / 32 to yield 6.87 percent . 
the negative spread between the bonds narrowed to 12 basis points from 14 basis points on Wednesday . 
the three-month cash T-bill yielded 3.18 percent against its U.S. equivalent which yielded 5.30 percent .
