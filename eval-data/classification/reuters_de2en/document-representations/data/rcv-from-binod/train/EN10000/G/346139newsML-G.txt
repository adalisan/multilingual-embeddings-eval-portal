English premier league club Blackburn on Friday denied reports Swedish coach Sven-Goran Eriksson had asked to be released from his agreement to become manager of the club later this year . 
Italian newspapers had said Eriksson , currently coach at Sampdoria , wanted to pull out of the deal after receiving a three billion lire ( $ 1.9 million ) offer to become manager at Lazio . 
the reports said Blackburn had agreed to his request . 
but this was strongly refuted by Blackburn chairman Robert Coar . 
&quot; We have a written agreement with Sven-Goran Eriksson that he &apos;ll be with us in July . 
that &apos;s the situation , pure and simple . 
there are no get-out clauses and he &apos;ll be with us in July , &quot; he said . 
according to the Rome daily La Repubblica , Eriksson made his request after being asked to take over at Lazio , the serie A club which sacked Zdenek Zeman as manager on Monday and appointed former Italy goalkeeper Dino Zoff as a temporary replacement until the end of the season . 
la Repubblica said Blackburn had agreed to release the 48-year-old Eriksson on condition they could find an adequate replacement and it suggested Blackburn had Inter &apos;s English coach Roy Hodgson and Barcelona &apos;s former England manager Bobby Robson in their sights . 
Blackburn , premier league champions in 1995 but currently fourth from the foot of the table , signed a preliminary agreement with Eriksson in December for him to take over in July . 
a front-page article in Rome &apos;s sports daily Corriere dello Sport said Eriksson &apos;s mind was definitely made-up . 
&quot; Sorry , but I don &apos;t want to leave Italy any more , &quot; Eriksson was quoted as telling Blackburn , beneath the headline &quot; Eriksson : Lazio , Si &quot; . 
Eriksson enjoyed a highly successful three-year spell in the Italian capital with Lazio &apos;s arch-rivals Roma in the mid-1980s , narrowly missing out on the league title in 1986 . 
after periods with fiorentina and Portugal &apos;s Benfica , Eriksson has spent the past five seasons successfully rebuilding Sampdoria , this season leading the side to second-place in the Italian first division behind Juventus .
