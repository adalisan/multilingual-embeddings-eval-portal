the United States struggled on Wednesday to salvage an Israel-PLO deal for the West Bank town of Hebron amid Arab calls on Israel to respect old deadlines . 
PLO officials described the gaps in talks as &quot; very wide &quot; while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said only Palestinian intransigence was holding up a deal . 
&quot; There is a constant attempt by the other side to delay implementation of the agreement ... apparently there is a decision on the other side not to complete the negotations , &quot; Netanyahu told reporters . 
in Egypt , President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan &apos;s King Hussein held a meeting in the southern resort town of Aswan to discuss the peace agreements with Israel , which have been weakened by Israel &apos;s long-delayed withdrawal from Hebron . 
King Hussein , Israel &apos;s closest Arab ally , said the Jewish state must honour old deadlines for the next stage of redeployment from Palestinian parts of the West Bank . 
&quot; We feel extremely concerned if the situation doesn &apos;t evolve into peace , which is what we hope for , &quot; King Hussein told a joint news conference when asked if the new tensions between Israel and its Arab neighbours could lead to war . 
Mubarak said it was up to the Palestinians to decide on the timetable . 
but if the Palestinians lost confidence in Israeli promises , he added , it would &quot; mess things up &quot; and Syria would not rejoin peace talks with Israel . 
in Israel , U.S. Middle East mediator Dennis Ross continued his efforts to nail down a long-elusive accord on an Israeli handover of 80 percent of Hebron to Palestinian self-rule , meeting with Netanyahu in Jerusalem . 
but both sides said on Wednesday the sticking point had less to do with Hebron than with three further transfers of West Bank areas to Palestinian control . 
the Arab world views a Hebron deal as a test of Netanyahu &apos;s commitment to the peace deals he inherited from the government ousted last May . 
&quot; The gaps are still very wide , &quot; Nabil Abu Rdainah , an aide to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat , told Reuters . 
Arafat &apos;s spokesman described five hours of late night talks between Arafat and Ross on Tuesday as &quot; extremely tense . 
PLO negotiator Hassan Asfour said the talks were at an &quot; impasse &quot; and accused Netanyahu of trying to renege on Israeli commitments . 
the handover of the town , where 400 Jewish settlers live or study among more than 100,000 Palestinians , has been put off for 10 months largely because of Israeli security concerns . 
a 1995 interim peace deal binds Israel to complete the final handover of mostly rural areas by September of this year . 
Netanyahu wants to link it to talks due to be completed by May 1999 on a final Israeli-Palestinian peace arrangement . 
in Hebron , Jewish settlers said they had begun clearing a site for construction of a new apartment complex in an area of the town slated to remain under Israeli control . 
Palestinians say new Israeli construction in Hebron violates the 1995 Israel-PLO peace deal . 
the talks on Wednesday were conducted in the shadow of violence along Israel &apos;s northern border . 
Israeli warplanes twice attacked suspected targets of the Islamic Hizbollah ( Party of God ) group after attacks on Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon and a Katyusha strike on Israel . 
a Hizbollah spokesman in Beirut denied that the group had any links to the rocket attack on northern Israel . 
&quot; The Islamic Resistance denies that it has any links to firing any rockets on northern Israel , &quot; he told Reuters . 
the rocket attack was only the second in nine months since a ceasefire agreement in April 1996 banned pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas from firing Katyushas into northern Israel . 
the U.S.-brokered ceasefire understanding ended a 17-day Israeli blitz against pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas in Lebanon .
