the State ( central ) Bank of Pakistan said on Friday it had adjusted the rupee down to 40.3900 / 40.5920 to the dollar from 40.33000 / 40.5317 fixed on May 6 . 
the central bank gave no reason for the adjustment , but bankers said the move was in line with the government &apos;s policy to boost Pakistani exports . 
bankers said the market was expecting a rupee devaluation before the 1997 / 98 ( July-June ) budget , due on June 14 . 
&quot; Pakistan &apos;s trade deficit has widened and to keep the exports competitive , devaluation is necessary , &quot; a banker said . 
he said the current devaluation had nothing to do with the international currency market , but has been done because of country &apos;s weak fundamentals .
