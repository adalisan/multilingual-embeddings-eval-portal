a United Nations human rights body on Friday accused France of seriously maltreating some prisoners , particularly foreigners , and failing to investigate alleged abuses . 
the U.N Human Rights Committee also said they were concerned at reports of deaths from the unnecessary use of firearms by French authorities . 
a rise in the suicide rate in French detention centres , long pre-trial detention practices , tough immigration laws and abnormally long delays in probes into alleged rights abuses by law enforcement officers topped the body &apos;s list of concerns . 
the report said foreign and immigrant detainees bore the brunt of maltreatment by French law enforcement officials . 
lack of investigations into abuses allegedly committed by French police and Gendarmerie Nationale resulted in &quot; virtual impunity &quot; , the committee said in a report published in Geneva . 
&quot; In most cases , there is little , if any , investigation of complaints of such ill-treatment by the internal administration of the police and Gendarmerie Nationale , resulting in virtual impunity , &quot; the report said . 
&quot; The committee is seriously concerned by the number and serious nature of the allegations it has received ... including unnecessary use of firearms resulting in a number of deaths . 
it gave no further details of the allegations but urged the French government to grant access to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR to centres where asylum seekers or those awaiting deportation were held .
