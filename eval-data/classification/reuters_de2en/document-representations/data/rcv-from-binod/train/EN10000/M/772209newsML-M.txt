Chilean blue chips rallied to close over one percent higher with the market led by the Chispa stocks , which surged on news of the deal between Spanish utility Endesa and Enersis . 
the news is seen continuing to buoy the Bolsa next week as more details emerge of the $ 1.5 billion deal , the largest ever in Chile &apos;s energy industry , they said . 
&quot; There may well be more positive news from Endesa , which will keep stocks rallying , &quot; said Enrique Danioni , head of research at brokerage Sud American . 
the .IPSA index ended up 1.19 percent at 135.69 points . 
the general .IGPA index gained 0.51 percent to 5,735.79 points amid turnover of 12.5 billion pesos . 
traders reported heavy speculation in the Chispa group of investment companies on news Endesa will buy the firm &apos;s A and B series stock to take a controlling stake in Enersis . 
&quot; The deal is positive but we need to study it more to see various aspects including the administration and whether there will be changes in the company &apos;s policy towards investing abroad , &quot; said one analyst . 
investors are betting that Endesa will buy the stocks for up to 250 pesos per share with many disbelieving Endesa &apos;s statement that the offer will only apply to shareholders owning stock on May 30 , said traders .
