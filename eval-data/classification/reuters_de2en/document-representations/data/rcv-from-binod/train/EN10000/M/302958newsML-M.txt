&quot; You are starting the earnings season and everyone is bracing for the fourth quarter reports . 
J.P. Morgan was an auspicious start to the season and that is helping the market as much as anything today , &quot; said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.

&quot; The worst performing groups are the oils and chemicals , groups that are sensitive to the economy , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We &apos;ve had a couple of weeks during which the economic news was upbeat . 
&quot; Today , things are starting to creep back in the other direction . 
it is clear that this market is not convinced that the economy will remain strong .
