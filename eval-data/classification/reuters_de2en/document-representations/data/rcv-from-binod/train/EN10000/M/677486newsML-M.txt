the South Korean won closed flat against the dollar on Friday and dealers said the won was expected to stay firm on export deals and dollar supplies by foreign share investors . 
the won ended at 888.30 after trading in a narrow 888.20-888.80 range . 
&quot; Many traders would maintain short dollar positions as they see the dollar falling , &quot; said a domestic bank dealer . 
but dealers said any won rise would be limited in view of fears that the central bank will intervene if the local unit rises sharply . 
dealers said the won opened at 888.70 in line with the yen &apos;s weakness overnight . 
&quot; It regained strength as the yen did , &quot; one said . 
dealers said the won &apos;s base mid-rate would be pegged at 888.40 on Monday , the same as on Friday .
