the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) will discuss the rationalisation of its organisation and programme of action during a three day workshop due to open on Monday . 
executive secretary Kaire Mbuende will open the workshop which will be attended by sectoral co-ordinators from the 12 SADC member states and officials from the Gaborone-based secretariat . 
latest statistics from SADC , prepared for the February Consultative Conference in Windhoek , show that the projects that make up the programme of action are seriously underfunded , donor money is not coming forward as freely as it was hoped . 
of $ 8.2 billion sought , $ 3.5 billion is still required . 
sources within the secretariat said a major problem with the organisation of SADC was the staffing , decentralisation and lack of direct control over the sectoral offices . 
&quot; They have to report through the government of their host country . 
it can take weeks and even months before a report reaches the secretariat , &quot; one source said . 
the recommendations of the workshop are expected to be presented on Wednesday . 
the 12 SADC member states are Angola , Botswana , Lesotho , Malawi , Mauritius , Mozambique , Namibia , South Africa , Swaziland , Tanzania , Zambia , Zimbabwe . 
that Kenya , Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo should join SADC has been suggested , but no official positions have been taken .
