Britain &apos;s London Merchant Securities plc said on Wednesday it could realise at least 62 million stg in cash from the sale of its minority stake in BSB Holdings Ltd . 
earlier , media firm Granada Group plc said BSB Holdings had sold 19.5 million shares in British Sky Broadcasting Group plc , representing about 1.1 percent of the satellite company &apos;s share capital . 
the proceeds of the sale would be used to permit a restructuring of BSB &apos;s capital and enable London Merchant and other shareholders to realise their investment in the holding company . 
if approved , London Merchant said the proposals would result in it realising not less than 62 million stg in cash receivable this summer , compared with the book value of 8.1 million stg at March 31 . 
the cash proceeds would be placed on deposit pending reinvestment in the group &apos;s core activities , the company said in a statement .
