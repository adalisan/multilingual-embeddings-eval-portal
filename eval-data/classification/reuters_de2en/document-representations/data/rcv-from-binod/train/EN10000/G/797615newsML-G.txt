Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on Wednesday rejected new U.N. proposals aimed at fostering compromise in Cypriot inter-communal peace talks but will stay at the negotiating table , a senior Turkish official said . 
Inal Batu , deputy undersecretary of the Turkish Foreign Ministry who is in this Swiss village representing the Ankara government , told Reuters Denktash had refused to discuss or sign the new document tabled on Tuesday at his meeting with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and U.N.special Cyprus negotiator Diego Cordovez . 
&quot; But the negotiations will continue , &quot; Batu said . 
Cordovez , chairing the five-day session , had earlier presented Denktash and Clerides with an amended version of proposals he had tabled at July &apos;s inconclusive first round of Cyprus talks in New York . 
the Turkish official said Cordovez had insisted on putting forward the proposals despite Denktash &apos;s objection to the tabling of new documents at the five-day talks , held in a hotel in the village of Glion near Montreux and due to end on Saturday . 
&quot; The United Nations has submitted a document knowing that the Turkish Cypriot delegation did not come here to negotiate a document . 
Denktash rejected the document . 
he has also refused to sign any document , &quot; Batu said . 
&quot; But Denktash has said he is ready to continue the negotiations , &quot; Batu said . 
he said Denktash had reiterated his position at the two-and a-half-hour meeting . 
Cordovez was due to listen to Clerides at a second meeting scheduled for 1330 GMT . 
Batu said Cordovez was pressing the two sides to sign a joint declaration at the talks , aimed at ending the 23-year partition of Cyprus under a bi-zonal , bi-communal federation . 
he added : &quot; There will be no joint declaration . 
if they want to sign a one-sided declaration on their own , they can do it . 
but there was no need to come to Montreux for that . 
Denktash , head of the breakaway northern Turkish Cypriot state recognised only by Ankara , is on record as threatening to pull out of the negotiations if the European Union goes ahead with a plan to start entry talks for Cyprus early next year . 
the Greek Cypriot side says the EU plans have nothing to do with the negotiations to reunite the island , divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded the north in response to a coup in Nicosia engineered by the military junta then ruling Greece . 
Cordovez faces the difficult job of overcoming an impasse in the talks over the key issues of sovereignty , resettlement of refugees , security and guarantor states that have for decades deadlocked efforts to reunite the Mediterranean island under a bi-zonal , bi-communal federation . 
his mediating tactic appears to be conducting working papers that combine different options based on observations from talks with the two sides to draw out a compromise , while at the same time trying to keep Denktash and Clerides talking to each other . 
he detailed his latest proposals in a draft document on the procedure of the talks including a timetable and an annex about a proposed constitution and also referring to key sticking issues such as sovereignty , officials close to the talks said . 
these included a new paragraph saying both parties should refrain from any action that might damage the procedure . 
diplomats close to the talks said Greek Cypriots had sought a clarification on what this means -- and whether it might refer to the contentious issue of European Union entry plans . 
among the set of suggestions presented were : 
- There will be one federalist state with single and indivisible sovereignty -- a change from the previous paper that called for a sovereignty derived from the two communities 
- The federal republic will respect human rights 
- Each community will have its own territorial administration 
- A provision that Denktash and Clerides may meet in Cyprus on humanitarian issues 
diplomats said the papers omitted a paragraph in the previous document that Cyprus would enjoy a &quot; most favoured country &quot; status in trade with both Turkey and Greece . 
the new documents repeated a timetable under which the two sides would prepare their positions by the end of the year and start real negotiations in March 1998 , following presidential elections in the Greek Cypriot south set for February . 
Cordovez has called for a step-by-step approach in the negotiations but has not said how this fits in with the EU timetable , which gives him a five-month window .
