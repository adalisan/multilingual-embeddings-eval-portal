German economic growth must accelerate further to reach 1997 targets but private economists on Thursday said conditions were improving for such a pick-up , even though risks related to sluggish domestic demand lingered . 
economists largely shared Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt &apos;s assessment on Wednesday that growth needed to speed up now to reach Bonn &apos;s 2.5 percent goal but fears that Germany could fall far short of this goal should now be erased . 
&quot; I am astonished that fears about growth should crop up again , &quot; said Gerhard Grebe , economist at Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt . 
&quot; The 2.5 percent rate is within reach &quot; . 
soured in February by a record 4.7 million jobless total and a collapse in the construction industry , the mood has improved recently , paving the way for brasher official comments that Germany would pass its test on criteria for European currency union on time . 
delighted by stronger leading indicators , economists said conditions for growth , including monetary policy , were appropriate and the economy could grow by up to one percentage point in each successive quarter . 
&quot; Exports , already quite strong , will improve further during the year , &quot; helped in part by a stronger dollar , said Joachim Fels , economist at Morgan Stanley in London . 
consequently comments from Bundesbank council member Klaus-Dieter Kuehbacher , president of the state central bank in Berlin and Brandenburg , that growth targets were pitched too high had virtually no impact on markets , economists noted . 
Kuehbacher is seen to be closely linked to Berlin &apos;s economic research institute DIW , whose growth forecast is at the low end of the range of the five main institutes and few economists were surprised by his statements . 
while sentiment is slowly shifting , economists said risks remained , particularly as domestic demand , seen as necessary for a lasting economic recovery , has failed to kick in yet . 
&quot; There is a risk that German growth will not reach the forecast 2.5 percent and it is largely linked to public demand , &quot; said Mathias Haffner , economist at BZW in Frankfurt . 
calling Bonn &apos;s protracted debate on a planned tax reform a key obstacle to domestic investments , economists said the government could affect growth by finally removing some uncertainty on the issue and hurrying the process along . 
Goldman Sachs economist Thomas Mayer said that as long as the key issues of cutting taxes for individuals and companies were pushed through , later horse-trading on other points would not worry investors as much . 
&quot; Rexrodt should exert some pressure on his party and the ( opposition ) Social Democrats on the tax issue so that this uncertainty is finally cleared up , &quot; said Julius Baer &apos;s Grebe . 
he added that this could make a big difference even for small personal investments by raising disposable income . 
noting that one percentage point of economic growth could subtract about 0.4 percentage points from the budget deficit compared to gross domestic product ( GDP ) , or add it in reverse , economists said Finance Minister Theo Waigel should be in a particular hurry to push through reforms . 
a signal by Waigel in the mass circulation Bild newspaper to compromise was seen as a step in the right direction , even though economists were not overjoyed at his suggestion to cut social contributions and finance them through an increase in indirect taxes . 
&quot; The taxes should be cut -- period -- and not just shifted around , &quot; Goldman &apos;s Mayer said . 
with Waigel under increasing pressure to squeeze the budget deficit into shape for Europe &apos;s currency union , economists predicted that he might opt to raise mineral oil tax by some 10 or twenty pfennigs , drumming up another four to eight billion marks ( $ 2.3 to $ 4.6 billion ) for his coffers . 
he might also freeze spending again from mid-year . 
&quot; A spending freeze and a 20 pfennig hike in the mineral oil tax could do it , &quot; Fels said . 
ultimately economists said anything above a two percent growth rate should put Germany in line to comply with the reference level for the budget deficit under currency union of three percent of GDP . 
&quot; We do need an acceleration of growth to help the budget deficit lower , &quot; Mayer said . 
he said growth of 2.2 percent could translate into a budget deficit of 3.4 percent , which could just be enough to let Germany realise Chancellor Helmut Kohl &apos;s dearest goal and squeeze into the first group to adopt the new currency , the euro .
