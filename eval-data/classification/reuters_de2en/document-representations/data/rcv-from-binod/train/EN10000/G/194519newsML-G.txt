Deportivo Coruna wasted a golden opportunity to overtake Barcelona at the top of the Spanish first division on Saturday in a tedious 0-0 draw at neighbours Compostela . 
champions Atletico Madrid hung on to beat Espanyol 2-1 , but Tenerife and Valencia , both in European action this week , endured contrasting fortunes . 
Tenerife beat Hercules 3-1 but Valencia could only manage a goalless draw at home to struggling Extremadura . 
their unhappy fans booed beleaguered coach Luis Aragones at the end of the game and called for the return of Brazilian striker Romario , who left the club last month . 
Deportivo &apos;s second consecutive goalless draw left John Toshack &apos;s side with 27 points from 13 games , one point behind Barcelona , who play Valladolid on Monday . 
Deportivo missed suspended striker Mickael Madar and injured creative chief Fran Gonzalez in a Galician derby which looked like a practice match . 
there were less than half a dozen shots on goal in the entire game . 
Atletico Madrid , in sixth place , closed the gap on Barcelona to seven points thanks to a strike by international playmaker Jose Luis Caminero and defender Santi Denia &apos;s first goal for the club . 
but Radomir Antic &apos;s side had to fight hard to hang on after Javi Garcia pulled one back for the visitors 10 minutes from the end . 
shortly afterwards Atletico were reduced to ten men when forward Kiko Narvaez picked up his seoncd yellow card . 
Tenerife looked to have victory tied up thanks to a 55th minute goal by Antonio Robaina , only to see Hercules hit back with just five minutes to go . 
the Canary Islanders promptly struck again twice before the final whistle through Juanele Castanos and Meho Kodro .
