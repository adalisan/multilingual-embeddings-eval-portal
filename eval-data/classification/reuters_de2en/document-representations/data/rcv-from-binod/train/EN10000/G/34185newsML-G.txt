Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Thursday sharply criticised his African National Congress rivals and the former white government but did not admit fault in testimony to South Africa &apos;s &quot; truth commission &quot; . 
Buthelezi , who leads the mainly Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party , delivered a 760-page indictment of Nelson Mandela &apos;s ANC and the country &apos;s former white rulers to the truth commission on human rights crimes under apartheid . 
he denied any role in the violence that has racked his KwaZulu-Natal home province for the past decade , but apologised that members of his party were drawn into conflict with supporters of the ANC -- in which around 15,000 people have been killed since the mid-1980s . 
the Inkatha submission , including a catalogue of attacks on its members , gave no details of any violence blamed on Inkatha . 
Buthelezi said his party was alone in the struggle against apartheid , without the support or funding given to Mandela &apos;s ANC which had taken up arms against the apartheid governments . 
&quot; As we look around this room , we do not see many friends . 
&quot; Buthelezi told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission headed by 1984 peace laureate Desmond Tutu . 
in an apparent reference to Tutu , an Anglican archbishop who was for decades a prominent voice of opposition to apartheid , Buthelezi said the country needed apologies from &quot; some of South Africa &apos;s more political clergy &quot; . 
the statutory commission has been given two years to probe the human rights record of the struggle over apartheid , to pardon perpetrators of abuses and award limited compensation . 
de Klerk of the National Party gave details last month of human rights violations perpetrated by their supporters and apologised for their actions . 
but Buthelezi said on Thursday this was not enough . 
&quot; I believe that the ANC &apos;s national executive must apologize to South Africa purposefully , simply and specifically for the planting of bombs on street corners , in discos , in supermarkets and other public places , &quot; he said . 
history showed the ANC &apos;s armed struggle was unnecessary and its support from international groups had been misguided . 
&quot; It would be a hideous distortion of political reality to say that South Africans had to die on street corners from bombs planted there ... That would be hideously untrue , &quot; he said . 
Inkatha chairman Frank Mdlalose told the commission about ANC plots to assassinate Buthelezi and wipe out Inkatha -- a war still being fought , he said . 
&quot; Our transformation from apartheid is increasingly being revealed as a seven-day wonder . 
there is no peace and there is no freedom , &quot; said Mdlalose , who is premier of the Zulu heartland province of KwaZulu-Natal , site of most of the violence between the ANC and Inkatha .
