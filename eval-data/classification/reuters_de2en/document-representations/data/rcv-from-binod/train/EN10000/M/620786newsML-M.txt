Swiss shares slipped more than one percent but ended off the day &apos;s lows as profit-taking in blue chips and derivatives-linked transactions wiped out initial gains on Wednesday . 
&quot; The market is also nervous at these high levels and nobody wants to take risks , &quot; one dealer said . 
trade again concentrated on Roche certificates following the company &apos;s announcment on Monday it planned to purchase German firm Boehringer Mannheim for some $ 11 billion . 
the blue-chip Swiss Market Index slid 56.9 points , or 1.1 percent , to 5,133.1 . 
the broad Swiss Performance Index was down 30.89 points at 3,250.39 . 
turnover was high at 3.26 billion Swiss francs . 
dealers said there was a great deal of shifting going on between different sectors . 
Roche slumped 385 francs , or nearly three percent , to 12,810 on profit-taking . 
traders noted the market generally welcomed the planned takeover of Boehringer . 
some foreign brokers were said to have raised price targets for Roche certificates . 
among chemicals , Ciba specialty Chemicals and Clariant bucked the trend , ending up 1.77 percent each . 
Ciba was up 2.50 francs at 144 , profiting from news first-quarter sales rose 19 percent and from a technical rebound . 
Clariant was up 16 francs to 920 on spin-off speculation . 
German Dystar GmbH said on Tuesday it would be interested in Clariant &apos;s textile dyestuff business but said it was not in a position to make a decision . 
Hoechst also holds a 45 percent stake in Clariant . 
Alusuisse added 18 francs to 1,380 . 
dealers said old rumours about the possible sale of the company &apos;s aluminium or chemical divisions may have been revived . 
major financials were mostly weaker except for insurer Zurich , which jumped 17 francs to 524 .
