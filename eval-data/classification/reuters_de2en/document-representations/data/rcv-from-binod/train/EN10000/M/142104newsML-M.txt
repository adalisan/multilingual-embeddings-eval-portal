the overnight interbank rate rose to 7.20 / 30 percent against 6.00 / 10 on Wednesday as the market tightened after Bank Negara &apos;s intervention , dealers said on Thursday . 
they said Bank Negara intervened to borrow for a one-month deposit at an unchanged 7.05 percent to draw out excess liquidity from the system . 
&quot; We don &apos;t know how much Bank Negara took so the rates are being quoted higher . 
but , it looks unlikely to go any higher , &quot; said a dealer with a Kuala Lumpur-based bank . 
Bank Negara regularly intervenes in the interbank market to mop up excess liquidity or set interest rates as part of its effort to maintain a tight monetary policy . 
it does not reveal the size of its intervention . 
dealers said the intervention , prompted by one-month money being quoted at the central bank &apos;s support level , did not absorbed a large amount . 
&quot; Otherwise the overnight should have hit 8.0 percent , as it usually does , &quot; one dealer said . 
earlier , interbank rates were also boosted by the intervention , with short-term tenures gaining the most . 
one-month money which was being offered at 7.10 percent before the intervention , rose to 7.15 percent . 
one-week money rose to 7.10 percent from 6.80 in the morning and from 6.90 / 00 on Wednesday . 
the two-week rate was at 7.15 / 20 from 7.00 in the morning and 7.00 / 10 previously . 
dealers said the central bank may have been prompted to intervene after some banks started offering one-month money as low as 7.10 percent , seen as a trigger level for intervention .
