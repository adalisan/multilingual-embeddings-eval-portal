Belgian money market yields were launched into orbit on Wednesday due to a liquidity drain caused by the central bank , traders said . 
&quot; It &apos;s purely a lack of liquidity . 
the central bank has been taking liquidity out of the market and the shorter the term , the more yields rise , &quot; one trader said . 
linear bonds ( OLOs ) were also weaker with the Bund / OLO spread widening most in the two- to five-year range . 
the benchmark 2007 OLO yield spread over comparable Bunds was up at 15 basis points , against 12 at the close on Tuesday . 
some traders said the central bank might have been cutting liquidity to nip any speculation against the Belgian franc in the bud . 
but the franc , which has been trading weaker than its midpoint to the mark of 20.6255 for several weeks , clearly failed to benefit and weakened further to 20.6435 / 45 to the mark , against 20.6395 / 15 late on Tuesday . 
recent domestic political trouble was seen by traders as the main cause for the franc weakness . 
but one also noted some speculation against the Dutch guilder . 
but traders welcomed the liquidity shortage , saying it boosted volatility and business in the money market . 
&quot; It &apos;s only bad for those who are long , &quot; one added . 
but trading in the OLO market continued to suffer from the absence of end-investors , another said .
