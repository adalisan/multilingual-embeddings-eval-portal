the stock market is expected to fluctuate considerably as new trading rule -- known as net settlement -- is introduced on Thursday for the first time . 
in a move to boost trading volume , the Stock Exchange of Thailand will from today allow investors who sell or buy the same stock on the same day to settle the transaction by paying only for capital gains or losses , without having to pay first and wait for three days to settle the deal . 
&quot; We expect the market to fluctuate for the whole session but with improved volume . 
it hard to say which direction the market will go as there are no major leads , &quot; said a broker at National Finance and Securities . 
&quot; But so far , it seems the sentiment has improved and foreign investors were net buyers in the last two days , &quot; he added . 
the SET Index gained 4.79 points , to end at 858.97 on Wednesday on 6.5 billion baht turnover .
