justice Minister Giovanni Maria Flick won praise from magistrates on Sunday for his plan to overhaul Italy &apos;s creaking legal system but said a proposal to beef up plea-bargaining did not mean the end of the country &apos;s war on graft . 
flick &apos;s draft changes , which will be presented to the centre-left cabinet of Prime Minister Romano Prodi this week , were hailed by commentators as a way out of the notorious tangentopoli ( Bribesville ) bribes-for-contracts scandals that broke in 1992 and toppled the political old guard . 
the main novelty of the plan would be to allow defendants facing jail terms of up to three years to negotiate sentences provided they admitted guilt . 
&quot; This is not a short-cut for tangentopoli , &quot; said Flick , a trained lawyer , adding his aim was &quot; a criminial justice system that works better for everyone &quot; . 
the plan won the thumbs-up from magistrates and limited approval from several members of the opposition centre-right Freedom Alliance , who called it a good starting point for talks . 
Milan &apos;s chief prosecutor Francesco Saverio Borelli , who has been at the heart of the tangentopoli investigations , said the plan would &quot; unblock and speed up justice &quot; . 
&quot; It &apos;s definitely not an amnesty in disguise , &quot; he said , adding he would extend it to crimes carrying longer penalties . 
but Carlo Taormina , lawyer for ex-Socialist prime minister Bettino Craxi , a top tangentopoli casualty sentenced to more than 25 years in jail , dismissed it as &quot; a licence to embezzle , extort , corrupt , launder dirty money , and traffic drugs with recourse to these immoral measures if you get caught &quot; . 
Italy &apos;s lumbering legal system has been overwhelmed by the sheer size of tangentopoli , a cosy web of corruption running right through politics and big business in which former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi , and Cesare Romiti , the boss of Italy &apos;s biggest firm , car maker Fiat , are among those on trial . 
magistrates also want to try Prodi for alleged misconduct when he ran state holding IRI and even the former star anti-graft magistrate Antonio Di Pietro is under investigation . 
some 1,000 people have been sentenced since tangentopoli broke but under Italian law a sentence becomes final only once the full appeals process has been exhausted . 
that takes years . 
as probes have spiralled -- a fresh scandal over alleged trial and contract fixing dubbed &quot; tangentopoli 2 &quot; was uncovered last September -- legal and political figures have increasingly debated how to close the chapter on tangentopoli . 
commentators say the new fast-track system with its &quot; super plea-bargain &quot; could be used in most criminal cases with the exception of murder , kidnapping , Mafia activities , major attacks and sexual violence which Flick has said would be exempt . 
Plea-bargaining has only a limited use at present and the defendant does not have to admit guilt . 
under the new system , graft charges would have the safety net that those convicted of corruption could still be barred from holding public office . 
flick also proposed allowing the payment of negotiable damages in return for up to a third off the sentence and the application of fast-track procedures to some crimes carrying life in jail , in which case the maximum term would be 30 years .
