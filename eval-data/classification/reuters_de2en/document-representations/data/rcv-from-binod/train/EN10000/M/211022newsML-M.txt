Sydney futures Exchange ( SFE ) wheat futures edged down on Friday but resisted the full extent of Chicago &apos;s overnight fall . 
with the U.S. in a 20 cent trading range for the March contract between $ 3.81 and $ 4.00 , a close outside that range was needed to give direction , Hillary said . 
the U.S. market &apos;s early rise then its heavy sell-off at the close indicated it may fall to test the bottom again , he said . 
&quot; I think a lot of local players may be sick of playing yo-yos with the world market and are perhaps waiting for an actual break . 
if ( it ) broke $ 3.80 you would see our market come off quite a bit , &quot; he said . 
&quot; ( But ) while the U.S. is range-trading ( Australia will ) sit roughly around this level , &quot; he said .
