Jennifer Capriati , playing her first match since leaving the Australian Open in tears last month , had a happier time at the IGA Tennis classic on Tuesday . 
the fifth-seeded Capriati shook off a slow start to beat Maria Alejandra Vento of Venezuela 6-3 6-4 in the first round . 
third seed Kimberly Po , who was just named to the U.S. Fed Cup team , and seventh seed Marianne Werdel Witmeyer also reached the second round . 
the 19th-ranked Po held off compatriot Tami Whitlinger Jones 7-6 6-4 , while Witmeyer caught a break when Nana Miyagi of Japan was forced to retire while on the verge of winning . 
Miyagi won the first set 6-4 and was leading 5-3 in the second when she had to quit with a lower back sprain . 
there was one minor upset when eighth-seeded Canadian Patricia Hy-Boulais fell to semi-retired veteran Pam Shriver 7-5 6-7 6-3 . 
the 20-year-old Capriati , in the second year of her comeback after her highly-publicised bouts with legal and personal problems , quickly fell behind 0-3 to Vento . 
the former teen phenom then went on a tear , winning 11 of the next 12 games to take the first set 6-3 and a commanding 5-1 lead in the second . 
I am happy with the way I am playing , &quot; said Capriati , who reached the final of the Sydney International only to suffer a devastating first-round loss at the year &apos;s first Grand Slam tournament days later . 
Capriati shrugged off her shaky start against Vento . 
&quot; This is the first time I have been seeded in awhile .
