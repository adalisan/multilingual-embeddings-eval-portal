the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday approved the release of a $ 130 million instalment of its loan to Bulgaria , an international monetary source said . 
the loan is part of a $ 510 million standby agreement aiming to help cement Bulgarian economic reforms . 
&quot; The loan went through without any problems and the money will be disbursed according to the standard procedures , &quot; said the source , who asked not to be identified . 
&quot; It was quite a positive meeting ... people were quite pleased to see the good progress that has been made . 
Bulgaria , trying to recover from a deep economic crisis , introduced a currency board on July 1 , pegging the Lev at one German mark per 1,000 Lev and backing Lev emissions with central bank mark reserves . 
officials say the currency board , introduced with strong IMF backing , has been working well . 
the aim is to curb inflation by anchoring the Lev to the mark .
