U.S. shares were steady in cautious trade on Tuesday as investors awaited Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s testimony before the U.S. Senate at 1500 GMT . 
investors were also wary of taking new positions ahead of IBM &apos;s fourth quarter earnings statement , due after Wall Street &apos;s close on Tuesday . 
&quot; The bond markets are weaker ahead of Greenspan &apos;s comments . 
people fear he will pour water on the Dow &apos;s rally and put out the fire , &quot; one market maker said . 
comments by Greenspan , always carefully scrutinised for any clue about Fed policy , are a persistent source of tension for markets . 
with the outcome of the Fed &apos;s next policy meeting still a matter of debate , the comments are drawing even sharper attention . 
&quot; If Greenspan hints about higher interest rates today the bonds will take a big hit and shares could be in for a bumpy ride , &quot; another dealer said . 
the dealer noted , however , that the Dow has risen around 400 points since the Fed chief , in early December , warned the share market about rising too far too fast . 
&quot; Greenspan may warn the market again , but it could again choose to ignore the warning , &quot; the dealer said . 
the Dow bellweather company is expected to report Q4 earnings of $ 3.88 per share according to First Call , compared with $ 3.09 per share in the same period a year ago . 
amongst other high-techs , Intel gained $ 1 / 4 at $ 145-1 / 2 , Texas Instruments rose $ 1 / 2 to $ 64-1 / 2 and Digital added $ 1 / 8 at $ 35 .
