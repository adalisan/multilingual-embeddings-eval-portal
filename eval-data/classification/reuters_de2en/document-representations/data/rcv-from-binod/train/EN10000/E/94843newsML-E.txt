U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on Wednesday called the world economic outlook the best in a &quot; long , long time &quot; and credited a new consensus over the best policies to follow for the improvement . 
addressing the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank , Rubin also praised the two lending agencies for their renewed attack on corruption and pledged &quot; full &quot; U.S. backing for their efforts . 
&quot; The fundamentals of the world economy look as solid as they &apos;ve been for a long , long time , &quot; Rubin said . 
his upbeat comments were the latest in what is proving to be a drumbeat of optimism during this year &apos;s annual meeting . 
Rubin told the gathering of 181 countries that much of the success in the recent period reflected what is now a widespread consensus on the best economic policies to follow . 
&quot; That consensus is to open markets , not close them , free business to compete , not restrain them , reduce deficits , not sustain them , and invest publicly in people , infrastructure and other areas critical to future productivity , &quot; he said . 
Rubin said the United States too was enjoying solid growth with low inflation . 
&quot; I believe that if we continue to follow the right policy path in this country , we can have solid growth and low inflation on balance over the long term . 
the financial markets seem to agree . 
the dollar rose on Wednesday to its highest level in over 2-1 / 2 years against the Japanese yen , while U.S. stocks soared to another record . 
Rubin though was not alone in singing the praises of the world economy . 
from rich and poor , large and small , the litany here has been the same -- the world economy is enjoying a period of growing opportunity and well-being that provides a platform for tackling issues that had seemed insurmountable . 
even Mexico and Russia -- countries that have until recently been wracked by economic turmoil -- seem to be on the mend , thanks in part to huge loans from the IMF . 
a Russian official said Wednesday that the IMF was set to hand over another $ 330 million to Moscow after a Fund mission delivered a positive report on the nation . 
and Mexican Finance Secretary Guillermo Ortiz he expects to negotiate a new three-year loan pact with the IMF in the first quarter of 1997 . 
but he called the credit &quot; precautionary &quot; and said the money would not be used except in an emergency . 
with the world economy looking up , problems that have only been whispered about in past annual meetings , such as entrenched corruption in many countries , are being discussed openly in the belief that it can be changed . 
world Bank President James Wolfensohn on Tuesday lashed out at corruption in industrial and developing countries , calling it a cancer and vowing not to tolerate it in the projects his organisation finances . 
by throwing a spotlight on a problem hidden out of sight in the past , the plain-speaking Wolfensohn risked raising the hackles of developing nations that may view his broadside against bribery as just an attempt to meddle in their affairs . 
Rubin , though , lauded Wolfensohn and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus for &quot; lifting the fight against corruption to the top of the agenda , &quot; calling it a major impediment to economic development . 
Rubin also urged the IMF and Bank to work together to help shore up banking systems in emerging market economies , saying that too often banking problems undermine economic growth . 
Wolfensohn on Tuesday said that one in five developing countries face a banking crisis , while Camdessus called such problems the &quot; Achilles heel &quot; of the global economy . 
declaring that America &apos;s economic future is increasingly linked with the rest of the world , Rubin pledged the &quot; fullest and upmost effort &quot; to work with Congress to meet U.S. financial obligations to the multilateral lending agencies . 
Washington has been criticised by its economic partners for failing to chip in what it has promised .
