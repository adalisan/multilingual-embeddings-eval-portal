a top Mexican prosecutor helped cover up police torture of an assassin in a key murder case in order to extract a confession , a leading Mexican newspaper claimed Tuesday . 
the allegations by the daily Reforma were the latest twist in the scandal surrounding the September 1994 shooting of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu , then the number two in the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( pri ) . 
former president Carlos Salinas de Gortari &apos;s brother Raul is in jail on charges of having masterminded the killing , allegedly because of a family feud . 
Raul has pleaded his innocence , saying President Ernesto Zedillo &apos;s government has tried to frame him . 
Reforma printed a transcript of what it said was a tape recording of 80 minutes of the interrogation of Daniel Aguilar Trevino , who confessed to having gunned down Ruiz Massieu outside a Mexico City hotel . 
in the tape , Reforma said interrogators tried to suffocate Aguilar , subjected him to electric shocks , hit him several times , dunked his head in a bowl of water and excrement and threatened him repeatedly to force a confession . 
the transcript showed Aguilar begging interrogators to allow him to vomit before receiving fresh torture , having carbonated water forced up his nose and being threatened with having carbonated water forced up his anus . 
despite the torture , Ismael Eslava Perez , then working for the government National Human Rights Commission , signed a statement afterwards saying he had inspected the prisoner and certified that his rights had been respected during the interrogation . 
Eslava is now a senior official at the Attorney-General &apos;s office in charge of the Ruiz Massieu murder investigation . 
holding the title of General Coordinator of Investigations , he is part of the team which Attorney-General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar brought with him from his previous job as head of the human rights commission . 
Spokeswomen at the Attorney-General &apos;s office had no immediate comment to make on the Reforma report and Eslava &apos;s office did not return calls on the subject . 
Zedillo has repeatedly pledged to make Mexico a &quot; country of laws &quot; where rules are scrupulously respected and torture becomes a thing of the past .
