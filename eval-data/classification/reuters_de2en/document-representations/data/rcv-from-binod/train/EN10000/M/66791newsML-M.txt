Polish shares extended last session &apos;s fall on Friday but analysts said the lower turnover and strong buying after price-fixing signalled the market would likely rise on Monday . 
the main market &apos;s WIG index fell 32.8 points , or 0.2 percent , to 14,504.1 and turnover fell 9.4 percent to 103.9 million zlotys ( $ 37.1 million ) on both markets as 39 issues fell , 20 rose and 19 were flat . 
&quot; It &apos;s likely the market will go up again , but the question is how far and how long it will rise &quot; , said Remigiusz Tarka , an analyst at IB Austria brokerage . 
some analysts said the main WIG index could rise to about 16,000 points in the next few weeks but said that a deeper correction afterwards was possible due to the bourse &apos;s rise by over 90 percent since the beginnning of the year . 
continuous trade turnover was at 1.2 million zlotys ( $ 0.4 million ) with biggest mover Bank Inicjatyw Gospodarczych ( big ) falling 3.9 percent . 
mass privatisation NFI units rose 5.3 percent in a 17.7-million-zloty turnover ( $ 6.3 million ) in the bourse &apos;s regular session and jumped 7.2 percent in continuous trade , also in 17.7-million-zloty ( $ 6.3 million ) trade . 
biggest loser construction company Espebepe , down 8.4 percent , dropped for the second day running after releasing a poor August earnings report .
