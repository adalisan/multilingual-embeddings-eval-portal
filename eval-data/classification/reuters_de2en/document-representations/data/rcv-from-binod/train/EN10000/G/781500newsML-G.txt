Spanish tenor Placido Domingo broke off his concert in a packed Chilean theatre on Tuesday night after just two Arias , saying that bronchitis kept him from continuing . 
fans speculated that Domingo &apos;s bronchitis may have been caused by the high levels of smog in the city that suffers some of the world &apos;s worst air pollution . 
&quot; It may have been the smog , the central heating . 
Domingo abandoned the concert at Santiago &apos;s Municipal Theatre after just half an hour , disappointing some 1,500 opera fans who had bought tickets to the recital with Chilean soprano Veronica Villarroel months ago . 
&quot; It is not fair for you or me to continue singing in these conditions , &quot; Domingo said after the second aria in the concert organised to commemorate his first visit to Chile 30 years ago . 
the tenor said he was planning to return to Chile at the end of the month to finish his recital . 
&quot; I feel sorry because of the enthusiasm of the public with this theatre full of flowers , but I want to return and we are trying to fix a date , &quot; he said in his dressing room where he was visited after the concert by dozens of fans , including President Eduardo Frei . 
Domingo often sings solo or accompanied by fellow Spaniard Jose Carreras and Italian Luciano Pavarotti in a series of concerts that have become known as the Three tenors .
