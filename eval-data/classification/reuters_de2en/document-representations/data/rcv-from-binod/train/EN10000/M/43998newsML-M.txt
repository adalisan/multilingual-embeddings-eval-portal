U.S. Plains cattle market activity midday Tuesday was mixed in light volume , feedlot sources said . 
a small packer in the northern plains of Texas paid $ 71.00 for about 500 head of top grade cattle while sales in other parts of the state were reported at $ 70.00 , the sources said . 
volume was estimated near 2,000 head , according to USDA and private sources . 
major packers continued to bid $ 70.00 against asking levels of $ 72.00 , but feedlot sources said the trade was anticipating a $ 71.00 market later in the week . 
Feedlot cattle prices were expected to be supported by tight numbers of fed cattle compared with a week ago and strength in the boxed beef market , the sources said . 
midday boxed beef prices were quoted up $ 0.80 to $ 1.08 per cwt , with 200 fabricated loads sold . 
the heavyweight choice value has climbed $ 1.76 since Friday &apos;s close .
