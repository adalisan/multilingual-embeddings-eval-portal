Croatian stocks closed mixed on Thursday on lower turnover and analysts expected relatively slow trade with some gains in blue chips in the days ahead . 
&quot; This will be so until the political situation becomes more clear , &quot; said Zoran Ilic of Consult Invest brokerage . 
but he expected an increased interest for food processor Podravka and confectioner Kras to push their prices up . 
only three of eight active issues rose , four fell and one was flat . 
turnover shrank to 2.6 million kuna from 7.7 million . 
Podravka was the most active stock with 1,510 shares sold , inching up eight kuna to 228 . 
Kras gained 10 kuna to 410 , with 652 shares traded . 
&quot; These two will play the major role on the market , &quot; Ilic said , predicting that trading with drugs firm Pliva and Zagrebacka Banka entirely depended on developments in London . 
both were on the losing side in Zagreb as their GDRs dipped in London . 
Pliva lost 430 kuna to 13,020 and only sold six shares . 
Zagrebacka edged down four kuna to 1,000 , with 1,326 units sold . 
its E-series were flat at 430 kuna on volume of 76 . 
top gainer , climbing 40 kuna to 1,050 , was hotelier Laguna -- the only issue in its group to resist the downward trend while two other stocks , Istraturist and Suncani Hvar , fell . 
Ilic predicted possible further losses in hotel stocks during the coming Christmas season . 
Istraturist was the top decliner , down 40 kuna or 22.2 percent to 140 on volume of 170 shares . 
Suncani Hvar inched down eight kuna to 50 , with 323 shares sold . 
second tranche of public debt refinancing bonds traded at five percent above par , down from 5.35 percent last week , on turnover of 2.6 million kuna .
