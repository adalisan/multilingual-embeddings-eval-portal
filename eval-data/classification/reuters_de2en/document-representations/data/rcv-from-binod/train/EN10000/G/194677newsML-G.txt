Russia on Saturday launched a rocket on a 100 million km ( 60 million mile ) mission to Mars to find out more about the icy planet and look for signs of life . 
the six-tonne probe lifted off from Kazakhstan &apos;s Baikonur space centre at 11.48 p.m. Moscow time ( 2048 GMT ) , Itar-Tass news agency said . 
it is due to reach Mars on September 12 next year . 
the $ 64 million Russian mission is the second of three planned trips from Earth to Mars in just over a month . 
the United States launched one robot voyage to the Red Planet two weeks ago and a second mission will blast off on December 2 . 
all will check for signs of water on the far-away planet -- a key clue to whether there once was life on Mars . 
Russia &apos;s Mars-96 mission is being launched two years behind schedule due to cash shortages in its hard-pressed space sector . 
its probe is carrying 1.1 tonnes of scientific equipment from 20 European countries and the United States . 
it includes two dart-like penetrators designed to pierce the Martian soil and take samples from below ground level and beam information back to the orbiting probe .
