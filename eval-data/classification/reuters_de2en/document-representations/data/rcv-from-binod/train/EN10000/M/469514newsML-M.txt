the dollar closed mixed Wednesday despite early gains on a surprisingly robust U.S. manufacturing report , which fuelled expectations of higher future interest rates following Tuesday &apos;s Federal Reserve rate rise . 
the dollar hit session highs against the German mark and Japanese yen shortly after the Commerce Department announced that U.S. durable goods orders rose 1.5 percent in February . 
analysts had been expecting a 0.4 percent pullback in February to follow January &apos;s strong showing of an upwardly revised 4.1 percent increase . 
&quot; They were pretty good numbers and pointed to more U.S. rate rises . 
it is my personal opinion that we can see another 50 basis points this year , &quot; said Hans Boman , chief spot dealer at Swedbank in New York . 
on Tuesday , Federal Reserve policy-makers raised a key short-term interest rate for the first time in more than two years . 
the federal funds rate -- the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans -- was increased 25 basis points to 5.50 percent . 
in light afternoon trading Wednesday , the dollar succumbed to profit-taking to close slightly lower at 1.6887 marks from Tuesday &apos;s close of 1.6903 and well below its 1.6955 session high . 
against the yen , the dollar also closed below its 124.47 session high at 124.18 , but held above Tuesday &apos;s 123.70 close . 
the prospect of more interest rate hikes in the near future bolstered the dollar as the gap between U.S. rates and those in Japan and Germany could become even more pronounced . 
also aiding the dollar was a rise in the British pound and active buying of Italian lira for marks on optimism that Italy &apos;s leaders will soon issue a mini-budget tailored toward meeting the criteria for joining the proposed European Monetary Union . 
a sneak preview of Italy &apos;s 1997 mini-budget was made available Wednesday , and the official , full unveiling is expected Thursday . 
the pound was boosted by news that Britain &apos;s trade deficit with the rest of the world had narrowed more than expected in January . 
that aided the currency because it suggested that recent fears that the pound &apos;s strength had hurt exporters were premature . 
the Office of National Statistics said the global trade deficit narrowed to 641 million pounds ( $ 1 billion ) , down from 825 million pounds ( $ 1.3 billion ) the previous month . 
the U.S. currency also got support from expectations of sizable Japanese investments in U.S. assets at the start of the new Japanese financial year next week , dealers said . 
&quot; We hear there is good interest to buy various U.S. securities from Japanese investors and Japanese trust banks , &quot; said Tom Arnold , chief dealer at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in New York . 
market players said trading was thin Wednesday , and business was expected to be relatively slow for the rest of the week as financial markets begin closing early in advance of the Easter weekend . 
many markets will shut down early Thursday , and trading in the United States and much of Europe will be closed Friday . 
in other trading , the dollar inched down to 1.4635 Swiss francs from 1.4655 at Tuesday &apos;s close , and fell to Canadian $ 1.3739 from C $ 1.3782 . 
the pound rose to $ 1.6295 from $ 1.6195 .
