Zairean peace talks resumed in South Africa on Monday as news broke of a rebel advance to within 30 km ( 20 miles ) of the crucial mining centre and second largest city of Lubumbashi . 
a South African foreign ministry spokesman said full delegations representing the government of President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila began their meeting shortly after 10 a.m. ( 0800 GMT ) at an undisclosed venue near Pretoria . 
&quot; The full delegations last met from 10 p.m. on Sunday until after midnight and they are just sitting down now to start again , &quot; he told Reuters . 
the talks resumed shortly after residents of Kipushi told Reuters by telephone that the town had fallen to rebels who continued walking towards Lubumbashi , about 30 km ( 20 miles ) down the road . 
the negotiators moved to a secret location after a frosty start in Pretoria on Saturday when rebel envoy Bizima Karaha in effect told the Kinshasa government delegation it was now or never if they wanted a peaceful settlement . 
the spokesman declined to say what progress had been made or when the participants might be ready to make a substantive statement . 
&quot; That will have to come from them , &quot; he said . 
the current talks are being brokered jointly by South Africa and the United Nations , which is being represented by U.N. and Organisation of African Unity envoy Mohamed Sahnoun . 
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was present throughout Sunday &apos;s talks , but handed over on Monday to Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad , who chaired the talks together with Sahnoun .
