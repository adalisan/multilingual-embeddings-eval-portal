Mexican overnight Cetes rates continued their early slide and were down 325 basis points at 21.00 percent in late morning dealing Monday . 
traders said rates were returning toward average trading levels posted last week from a late spike seen Friday in the wake of speculative pressure triggered by a temporary liquidity shortfall . 
dealers said a strong peso had also helped bring down secondary rates . 
benchmark 48-hour peso contracts were trading 2.3 centavos stronger at 7.8150 / 7.8170 per dollar .
