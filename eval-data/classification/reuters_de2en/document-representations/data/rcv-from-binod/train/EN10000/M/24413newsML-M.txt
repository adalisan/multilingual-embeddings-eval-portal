CSCE cocoa futures extended losses in light afternoon dealings Friday , as mixed trade and speculative selling pushed prices to the edge of key support , traders said . 
but dealers said today &apos;s activity was subdued , with many players absent ahead of the three-day holiday weekend . 
the CSCE will be closed Monday in observance of the U.S. Labor Day holiday . 
benchmark December cocoa settled down $ 11 a tonne , at $ 1,352 , after ranging between $ 1,368 and $ 1,351 . 
March fell $ 8 to $ 1,387 , while the rest ended $ 5 to $ 15 lower . 
volume was thin , at an estimated 4,300 lots , traders said . 
dealers said technically driven buying near the lows kept the December contract from breaching $ 1,350 a tonne support . 
they said December &apos;s next downside target would be $ 1,341 , a low reached one month ago . 
resistance was pegged at $ 1,370- $ 1,375 . 
on the week , the December contract slid $ 39 , or nearly three percent , as the latest round of Ivorian crop estimates pressured values , traders said . 
PCR Ltd &apos;s updated Ivorian 1996 / 97 crop forecast released Wednesday said prospects for the upcoming harvest had improved due to heavy rains in early July . 
they pegged output at about 850,000 tonnes . 
last week , a private U.S. forecaster reportedly estimated the 1996 / 97 Ivorian crop would range between 790,000 and 930,000 tonnes . 
last season the Ivory Coast produced a record cocoa crop of about 1.2 million tonnes .
