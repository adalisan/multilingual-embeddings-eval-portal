CSCE coffee prices continued to advance on Monday , led by steep gains in the spot December contract , as concerns about low near-term supply levels continued to bolster the market , trading sources said . 
&quot; The market is going up because there is no coffee , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; It is very tight . 
benchmark December futures jumped 2.90 cents per lb Monday , to 112.70 cents , its highest settlement in a month , after ranging between 113.00 and 110.25 . 
Second-month March finished up 2.10 , to 106.25 , while the rest gained 1.90 to 2.00 . 
dealers noted renewed buying interest by commodity funds , with locals seen following the upswing . 
light buy stops were triggered above 112.50 cents basis December , traders said . 
Scale-up origin selling was seen throughout the day , but dealers said it would probably be another four to six weeks until coffee coming in from Central America would build stockpiles . 
supply woes re-emerged last Monday , when the CSCE reported exchange-certified stocks fell to their lowest level in 12 years . 
&quot; The stockpiles keep getting tighter and they ( traders ) may have anticipated a further drawdown in stocks tonight , &quot; said Smith Barney analyst Walter Spilka . 
&quot; Overall the export season is getting off to a slow start . 
the nearby switch ballooned to 6.50 cents on Monday , from 5.65 at the close on Friday . 
on the charts , traders pegged December &apos;s next level of resistance at 115 cents . 
strong support was noted at 111.00 . 
volume was moderate , at an estimated 7,129 lots .
