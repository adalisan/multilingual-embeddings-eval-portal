Jan Ullrich of Germany emerged as cycling &apos;s new man to beat on Tuesday when he took a remarkable lead of nearly three minutes with a devastating finish to the 10th stage of the Tour de France . 
Ullrich , the first German to wear the leader &apos;s yellow jersey since 1978 , crushed his rivals , including his Telekom team leader and defending champion Bjarne Riis , with a powerful breakaway on the steep climb to the finish at Arcalis in Andorra . 
the 23-year-old German was one minute eight seconds ahead of second-placed Italian Marco Pantani and third-placed Frenchman Richard Virenque , in the 252.5-km stage in the Pyrenees . 
Klaus Peter Thaler was the last German to wear the prized yellow jersey which he held for two days 19 years ago . 
no German has ever won the Tour . 
Ullrich was 2 : 38 ahead of Virenque overall . 
Spaniard Abraham Olano , tipped before the Tour as a strong contender to fill the void left by compatriot Miguel Indurain who retired after five wins , was 4 : 46 adrift overall with Riis another seven seconds behind and Pantani 5 : 29 . 
ever since the first time I watched the Tour de France as a boy I wanted to become a cycling professional and one day wear it , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I had not thought about the yellow jersey before the Tour . 
Ullrich already looked strong as he came in fourth behind Frenchman Laurent Brochard on Monday in the first mountain stage of the Tour . 
he moved up to second overall then just 13 seconds behind Frenchman Cedric Vasseur , who is now 10th and 7 : 31 adrift . 
Virenque , first over the line on the Tour &apos;s highest climb of 2,407 metres at Port d &apos;Envalira and who took over the polka dot best climber jersey from his festina team mate Brochard , said : &quot; Today we saw a great Ullrich . 
on the longest day of the Tour -- Ullrich won in 7 : 46 : 06 -- the leading group remained compact right into Andorra , the likes of Riis and Olano making up on the descents the time they gave away on the climbs . 
then in the principality , Frenchman Jean-Philippe Dojwa of the Mutuelle de Seine et Marne team made a solo break on the day &apos;s fifth of six climbs at Ordino and remained ahead until Ullrich made his attack some 10 km from the Arcalis finish . 
Riis somehow managed to draw new strength in the final climb when he had looked out for the count . 
he embraced and congratulated Ullrich afterwards . 
the Dane said he and Ullrich had not discussed the German going out on his own , but he said : &quot; We have to accept that the way he was riding so strongly he should go for it .. &quot; 
Ullrich denied he had thoughts of victory on the Champs Elysees in Paris on July 27 . 
&quot; There are many days still to come , very hard days in the Alps , &quot; Ullrich said . 
all the riders stopped 45 km from the Luchon start at the Portet d &apos;Aspet climb for a minute &apos;s silence in memory of Fabio Casartelli at the Italian &apos;s memorial on the roadside where he was killed in a fall in 1995 . 
on Wednesday , the 192-km 11th stage heads out of Andorra and down to the Mediterranean at Perpignan .
