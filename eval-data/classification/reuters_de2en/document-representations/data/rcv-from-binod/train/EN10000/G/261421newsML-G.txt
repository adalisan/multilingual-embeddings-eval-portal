stepping back from its calls for sweeping reforms of the Superfund toxic waste cleanup law over the last four years , the Clinton administration said Tuesday there was no need for broad legislative changes . 
&quot; We all feel that the program is not a broken program , &quot; said a senior administration enforcement official , who asked not to be named . 
&quot; It &apos;s a substantially different program than it was four years ago and legislative changes should be targeted to the needs of today . 
EPA administrator Carol Browner had repeatedly said the program was broken and needed to be fixed by Congress . 
but enforcement officials said Tuesday they had changed their view because administrative moves by the EPA had led to quicker and cheaper cleanups . 
to date , the government has spent about $ 14 billion and companies have spent about $ 12 billion to begin getting rid of waste at the 1,300 Superfund sites . 
on average it has taken about 12 years to clean up sites . 
efforts to pass broad reform of the 16-year-old Superfund law failed in the last two congresses . 
last year , Legislation proposed by Republicans came to a halt over whether firms that dumped toxic waste legally should have to pay to clean it up . 
House Republicans blamed the administration for stalling negotiations in the election year . 
&quot; The administration committed to negotiations in the last Congress and yet would never come to the table -- now we know why , &quot; a spokesman for the House Commerce Committee said . 
White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles said recently that Superfund reforms would be a high priority , but the enforcement officials said they were still assessing if changes were needed . 
the officials said that their main goal would be to reinstate the Superfund taxes , worth about $ 4 million a day , which expired at the end of 1995 . 
but House Republicans have said they would not renew the corporate environmental , oil and petrochemical taxes unless the Superfund program was overhauled .
