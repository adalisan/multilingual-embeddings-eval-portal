IPE Brent crude dipped in early afternoon trade on Tuesday , pulled to session lows by losses on U.S. markets ahead of the release of key inventory data . 
July Brent touched a low of $ 19.23 before recovering slightly to trade at $ 19.28 a barrel , down 24 cents on Monday &apos;s close by 1437 GMT . 
&quot; The market looks principally crude led at the moment , &quot; said a broker . 
U.S. crude stocks are over 18 million barrels above year ago levels and some brokers expect American Petroleum Institute ( API ) figures due later on Tuesday to show little change . 
&quot; Current expectations suggest a crude draw of 2-3 million barrels , although watch out for potentially high import figures into the U.S. Gulf which could scupper a stock fall , &quot; said brokers GNI . 
brokers would also be watching the API data for further evidence of the strength of U.S. demand for gasoline which typically sets the pace for oil markets during the early summer . 
&quot; We &apos;re expecting a slight build given the high refinery throughputs so any falls ( in gasoline stocks ) could prompt another move higher , &quot; said a broker . 
brokers saw support at $ 19.09- $ 19.12 a barrel on July Brent . 
also keeping dealers on their toes were continuing discussions in New York aimed at agreeing an extension of the six-month U.N. oil-for-food deal which expires on Saturday . 
U.N. Security Council members are scheduled to meet Tuesday to draft a resolution to allow the $ 2 billion pact &apos;s renewal , probably by Friday at the latest , U.N. sources said . 
&quot; A lot of this is background noise but the locals have tried to push the market lower , &quot; said a broker . 
despite the move lower , July Brent remains well within a 50-cent range established since a sharp 78-cent slide a week ago .
