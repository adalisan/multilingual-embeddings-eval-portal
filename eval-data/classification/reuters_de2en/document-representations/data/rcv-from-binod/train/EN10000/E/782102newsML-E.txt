Italy &apos;s trade surplus is &quot; still satisfactory &quot; but will probably be less this year than in 1996 , Foreign Trade Minister Augusto Fantozzi said in a statement . 
earlier , statistics office Istat said Italy had a global trade surplus in May of 4.73 trillion lire ( $ 2.6 billion ) against 7.41 trillion lire a year ago . 
Italy &apos;s surplus for all of 1996 was 67.48 trillion lire from 45.51 trillion in 1995 . 
&quot; It is unlikely that forecasts of a surplus ( in 1997 ) in line with 1996 will be borne out , &quot; Fantozzi said . 
&quot; Unless there is a change in trend , the surplus could be smaller , &quot; he added . 
ISTAT said earlier that imports from non-European Union countries climbed 18.2 percent in June to 11.68 trillion lire , while exports rose 5.5 percent to 15.55 trillion lire . 
&quot; The growth in imports is gathering pace ... confirming that internal demand , after a long period of stagnation , is now waking up , &quot; Fantozzi wrote . 
he noted the recovery in imports largely centred on consumer goods instead of intermediate or investment goods . 
&quot; This makes one suspect that output from Italian companies is not growing at the same pace as demand , partly because of the strength of the dollar , &quot; he said . 
ISTAT officials said the import boom was particularly evident in the car sector , with a government incentive scheme aimed at boosting car sales giving a boost to both domestic and foreign auto firms operating in Italy .
