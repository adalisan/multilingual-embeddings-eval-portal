President Bill Clinton said on Monday he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had a &quot; very specific , frank , candid and long talk &quot; on the stalled Middle East peace prospects but he could say no more until he had spoken with the Palestinians . 
&quot; We had a very specific , frank candid and long talk . 
and now we &apos;re going to talk to the Palestinians and see whether there &apos;s something we can do to get this thing going again , &quot; Clinton told reporters after a meeting of about two hours with Netanyahu . 
&quot; The problem is , the more I comment the more I undermine chances of success , &quot; Clinton told reporters an another White House event that followed the Netanyahu meeting . 
I &apos;m going to do my best to get it ( the peace process ) back on track . 
the Netanyahu visit was arranged hastily in hopes reviving Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that have been disrupted by angry Arab reaction to Israel &apos;s decision to build new Jewish housing in Arab East Jerusalem , and by Israeli demands for a halt to Arab attacks on Israelis . 
Netanyahu said before the meeting that Israel considered the housing construction a right that it had no intention of stopping . 
he declined to answer questions from White House reporters after his talk with Clinton . 
&quot; This was a profoundly serious meeting , profoundly serious enough that we &apos;re going to say very little about it , &quot; White House press secretary Mike McCurry said . 
he said Clinton expected to talk with a Palestinian delegation later this week , and added that he thought Clinton had given Netanyahu &quot; some serious things to think about .
