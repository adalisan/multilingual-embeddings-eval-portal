NYMEX crude and heating oil futures fell on Monday in a continuation of the sell-off which began two weeks ago on diminishing worries about low inventories . 
gasoline futures rose modestly as recent refinery problems in the Gulf of Mexico and a switch away from gasoline production helped reverse gasoline &apos;s previous seasonal price decline . 
DEC crude closed 28 cents lower at $ 22.75 a barrel , while Dec heating oil was off 0.80 cents at 65.80 cents a gallon . 
&quot; Everything was real quiet most of the day with very low volumes . 
the outlook is still sideways , lower ; it &apos;s still in trouble , &quot; said a NYMEX trader at brokerage prudential . 
the market quickly discounted news over the weekend that a U.S. jet fighter fired at an Iraqi position , the prudential trader said . 
and there wasn &apos;t much reaction to news that Sun Co would keep an 80,000 crude distillation unit at its Marcus Hook refinery down an extra month after a scheduled maintenance because of poor margins , he added . 
&quot; gasoline was the primary supporting factor ... but going out late in the day so close to the lows and with longs liquidating close to the close , it &apos;s not a good sign , &quot; said Tom Bentz , a trader at ING Derivatives . 
December gasoline futures ended at 65 cents a gallon , up 0.30 cent on the day . 
but forward gasoline contracts declined across the board and the sector remains relatively weak . 
the gasoline market has been supported in the last two weeks by a series of problems at refineries in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean , including a problem at Venezuela &apos;s giant Amuay complex . 
also , a stronger market in Europe has choked off imports to some degree , traders said . 
gasoline has recovered from an 11 cent discount against heating oil to a 1.54 cent premium last Thursday . 
but December gasoline ended at an 0.80 cent discount to heating oil on Monday and remains at the low end of its seasonal average . 
&quot; It appears the market is in a downward mode here . 
it looks like we &apos;ll get more weakness tomorrow , at least early in the session , &quot; said Bentz . 
the market will then focus on the American Petroleum Institute and Energy Department weekly inventory reports due out late Tuesday / early Wednesday to see if the strong burst of heating oil production in early October continued through last week . 
since peaking two weeks ago at a post-Gulf War high $ 26.10 a barrel , NYMEX crude has slumped 13 percent to $ 22.75 in early after-hours trading on Monday . 
though more losses are forecast , traders said the market decline may slow down now as &quot; oversold &quot; signals are flashing , with three-day relative strength index at around 4.0 on Monday , well below the 10 level which typcially signals a bottom .
