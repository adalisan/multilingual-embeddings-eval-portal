the Chinese yuan closed down at 8.2972 against the U.S. dollar on Monday from 8.2966 last Friday on speculative selling , but pro-yuan sentiment remained strong due to China &apos;s increased trade surplus , dealers said . 
the offical media said on Saturday that China posted a trade surplus of $ 12.24 billion for 1996 . 
the yuan opened slightly up at 8.2960 and moved mainly between 8.2965 and 8.2970 for most of the session , hitting an intra-day high of 8.2915 and a low of 8.2975 . 
trading was dull , with most done at 8.2966 , traders said . 
&quot; Some speculative offers pushed the yuan down before the close , but such activity will have little impact on the yuan &apos;s stable upward trend , &quot; one dealer said . 
he added that China &apos;s bigger trade surplus strengthened the yuan and was supporting its move towards higher levels . 
dealers expect the yuan to continue to move around 8.2970 on Tuesday . 
the yuan closed up at 7.1393 from 7.1450 against 100 Japanese yen and ended little changed at 1.0726 from 1.0727 against the Hong Kong dollar .
