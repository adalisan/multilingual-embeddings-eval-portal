Slava Dosedel has been chosen to replace Bohdan Ulihrach for the Czech Republic &apos;s Davis Cup tie against India in the first round of the 1997 world group . 
Czech tennis officials said Ulihrach , who had earlier been named to the team by captain Vladimir Savrda , had failed to sign an agreement with the Czech Tennis Union over his participation . 
the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes reported on Wednesday that Ulihrach &apos;s manager advised him not to play since &quot; it could be a waste of time &quot; if the player trained for a week and then did not play a match . 
Petr Korda , Jiri Novak and Martin Damm complete the team . 
Olympic bronze medallist Leander Paes spearheads the Indian team which also includes Mahesh Bhupathi , Susheel Narla and Nitin Kirtane . 
the Czechs are seeded fifth . 
India are unseeded . 
the tie will be played from February 7-9 on indoor clay courts in the town of Pribram , 55 km ( 35 miles ) southwest of Prague .
