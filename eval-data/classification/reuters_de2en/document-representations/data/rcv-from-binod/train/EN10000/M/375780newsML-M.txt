a Chicago Board of Trade task force recommended Thursday the following alternative to the exchange &apos;s current grain delivery system , the CBOT said . 
- Northern Illinois River , from Pekin , Ill. to Chicago , including Burns Harbor . 
- Number 2 grade yellow corn delivered fob water conveyance , four to five cents over futures . 
- Number 2 grade yellow soybeans delivered fob water conveyance , two to four cents over futures . 
- Delivery would be a shipping certificate . 
- Each facility &apos;s regularity will be calculated by taking 30 days and multiplying it by one eight-hour day loading rate . 
- Storage rates would be .0012 cent per bushel per day in Chicago and .0010 cent per bushel per day on the river . 
- The vessel loading rate would remain unchanged at 300,000 bushels per day . 
- deliveries would have to be made in 50,000 to 55,000 bushel increments . 
- Financial requirements for the deliveries would be $ 40 million minimum net worth and outstanding receipt value is not to exceed 25 percent of net worth . 
the commodities futures Trading Commission in December ordered the CBOT to increase grain storage capacity in Chicago in 75 days or face regulatory action . 
in response , the exchange named new members to an existing task force . 
the original task force had proposed a plan to expand grain storage space in Chicago , but the plan was voted down by the exchange &apos;s membership in October 1996 . 
the new task force is slated to meet again later this month to review comments on the proposal .
