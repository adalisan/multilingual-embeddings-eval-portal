Indian Finance Secretary Montek Singh Ahluwalia said on Thursday that corporate tax cuts proposed in last week &apos;s federal budget for 1997 / 98 ( April-March ) could spur increased capital formation and fuel growth . 
&quot; Revenue growth of around 16 percent can be achieved in spite of a cut in tax rates , &quot; Ahluwalia told a meeting of businessmen of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry ( Assocham ) in the Indian capital . 
if this is achieved , fiscal deficit would be under control , and at the same time serve as an incentive to invest , he said . 
&quot; It will support much higher rates of capital formation , &quot; Ahluwalia , the most senior civil servant in the Finance Ministry said . 
India aims to cut fiscal deficit to 4.5 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) in 1997 / 98 , after closing the current 1996 / 97 fiscal at 5.0 percent . 
the budget announced by the centre-left United Front coalition government proposed to cut corporate tax to 35 percent from 40 percent in a move that surpassed industry &apos;s expectations . 
net tax revenue in 1997 / 98 has been projected at 1133.93 billion rupees ( $ 31.6 billion ) , up 16.6 percent from an expected 972.12 billion in 1996 / 97 . 
&quot; I think the budget as a whole is a sign of confidence , &quot; Ahluwalia said . 
international investors had come to believe that there was a much deeper consensus on the economic reform programme launched in 1991 , he said . 
the Congress party had launched the reforms , which are being continued by the successor government after the Congress lost power in general elections last year . 
with a bit of luck , India &apos;s long-term growth rate environment will be seen as seven percent . 
that is no mean achievement , &quot; Ahluwalia said . 
India expects GDP to grow by 7.0 percent or more in 1997 / 98 , after closing 1996 / 97 with 6.8 percent .
