top law enforcement officials and interior ministers of 11 east European countries met in the Slovak capital Bratislava on Wednesday to discuss a joint strategy to combat drug crime in the region . 
the two-day meeting , also involving officials from Interpol and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , was to discuss harmonising laws to promote cooperation in the fight against organised drug crime in the former Soviet bloc . 
&quot; Slovakia is beginning to be no longer only a transit country , as the domestic drug scene emerges , with heroin as the leading hard drug , &quot; Slovakia &apos;s interior minister Gustav Krajci told the conference . 
he said the fall of the communist police state in 1989 left Slovakia unprepared to face an explosion of all kinds of crime , including drug smuggling and consumption . 
&quot; Changes in the former Soviet Union and the Balkan war also contributed to plugging Slovakia into the network of the international drug business , &quot; Krajci said . 
most countries in the region do not have clear legislation , making international cooperation against drug crime harder . 
&quot; New legislative measures should create the framework for combating all forms of crime , including the organised and transnational , &quot; Krajci said . 
&quot; This requires a complete re-codification of the criminal code , &quot; he added .
