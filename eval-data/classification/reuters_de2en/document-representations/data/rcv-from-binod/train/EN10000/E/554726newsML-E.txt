the Irish pound is expected to continue its slide on Thursday , its rate of descent temporarily slowed as the market &apos;s focus is distracted by Britain &apos;s poll and the lack of business from key European markets , closed for a May Day holiday . 
&quot; There is still huge downside potential in the Irish pound , &quot; AIB Group Treasury economist Oliver Mangan told Reuters . 
&quot; We believe the mark / Irish will find a floor at around 2.53 marks by which stage the forward rates will be discounting a move back to its ERM central parity . 
the Irish pound hit a five-year low against sterling on Wednesday and dropped 6.5 pfennigs against the mark after Ireland &apos;s central bank indicated it was not going to intervene to shore up the ailing currency . 
the punt encountered huge selling pressure on the assumption that Ireland would have to drop to the central rate within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism if it hopes to enter a single currency in 1999 . 
this would imply a level of 2.41 against the mark , dealers said . 
Ireland &apos;s Finance Minister Ruairi Quinn on Wednesday tried to soothe markets , saying Ireland did not necessarily have to enter a single currency at the central rate . 
he said no decision had been made on this yet . 
&quot; Quinn said yesterday that Ireland may not necessarily go into a single currency at the central rate but one of the original criteria for joining the single currency was that your currency had to be stable around the central rate precisely to avoid these kind of problems , &quot; Riada stockbroker &apos;s economonist Dan McLaughlin said . 
&quot; So essentially this is the price we have to pay if we want to join EMU . 
by 0947 GMT , the Irish unit fell to 0.9150 / 80 stg from a close of 0.9248 stg on Wednesday . 
it dropped to 2.5674 / 99 marks from a close of 2.5992 . 
dealers said the rate of descent was slowed partly by lack of European business as core Europe remained closed for a May Day holiday . 
operators were also distracted by Britain &apos;s general election . 
&quot; The market considers it a one-way bet , the punt will continue to fall , &quot; McLaughlin said . 
&quot; What would help is if sterling fell as well . 
right now it is unambiguously negative for inflation because we are falling against both sterling and the mark . 
dealers said if Britain &apos;s Labour Party gets an expected landslide victory in Thursday &apos;s poll this will compound the punt &apos;s problems as the new government is likely to tighten policy , both fiscal and monetary , &quot; ... so if that happens sterling is more likely to firm not fall . 
Irish money market rates were also under pressure as a consequence of the Irish pound &apos;s sharp drop . 
&quot; Traders are borrowing Irish pounds which is pushing up interest rates and one month money has been trading above 6.5 percent . 
if it stays at this level it is likely to trigger a mortgage rate hike , &quot; McLaughlin said . 
Ireland &apos;s official Short Term Facility rate ( STF ) , which is considered a ceiling rate , is set at 6.25 percent . 
McLaughlin said the central bank could try to push rates down below 6.0 percent but would make the currency cheaper to borrow and sell it &quot; ... and that would accelerate the fall . 
&quot; ... or if they try to hold up the fall or reduce its pace by leaving interest rates above 6.0 percent then you are going to have a mortgage rate rise , &quot; he said .
