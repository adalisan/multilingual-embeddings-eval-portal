the Mauritian rupee strengthened against the dollar and sterling on Friday in line with international trends , commercial banks foreign exchange dealers said . 
the rupee was fixed at a mean commercial rate of 19.9735 to the dollar from 20.1015 on Thursday . 
the rupee was quoted at a mean rate of 32.7770 versus the pound from 33.1055 on Thursday . 
Forex dealers said the stronger rupee on Friday reflected the weaker dollar in overnight international markets . 
&quot; Commercial banks are long in their foreign exchange reserves and the rupee &apos;s fixings at the moment are principally influenced by international trends , &quot; one dealer said . 
he added the long positions in banks arose from regular central bank interventions in the interbank forex market . 
the central bank said it sold $ 1.45 million to banks this week during two interventions on Tuesday ( corrects from Monday ) and Wednesday . 
both intervention rates were lower than the prevailing interbank rate , dealers added . 
&quot; The lower intervention rates gave support to the rupee and this was an extra appreciating factor for the local currency against the dollar during the past week , &quot; one dealer said . 
an increased supply of foreign currency to commercial banks was seen on Friday with a tender sale of sterling from the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate . 
since last August , the syndicate sells 25 percent of the island &apos;s sugar export proceeds directly to banks and the remaining 75 percent is kept by the central bank for market intervention . 
sugar is the largest hard currency earner for Mauritius in net value added terms ahead of textiles export and tourism .
