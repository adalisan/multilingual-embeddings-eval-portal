Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko sacked his defence minister for turning up drunk at an official ceremony on Friday , Russia &apos;s Interfax news agency said . 
defence Minister Leonid Maltsev had earlier arrived with Lukashenko to mark the 75th anniversary of a medical institute in the capital of the former Soviet republic . 
&quot; The reason for his sacking was the general &apos;s behaviour , who was drunk at the moment when he had to deliver an opening speech at the celebrations , &quot; Interfax said . 
&quot; The head of the military body was unable to read the prepared text clearly , &quot; the agency added . 
a defence ministry spokesman said he was unaware of the decision and presidential administrative officials were unavailable for comment . 
but Interfax said Lukashenko interrupted Maltsev &apos;s speech , ordered him to leave the hall and promptly announced his sacking , Interfax said . 
the president &apos;s bodyguards accompanied Maltsev from the hall . 
a few hours earlier Maltsev had attended a ceremony to open a new satellite communications centre near Minsk , Interfax said . 
Belarus is the most militarised of the former Soviet republics , with 100,000-strong armed forces in a nation of about 10 million . 
the republic , sandwiched between Poland and Russia , is home to 18 SS-25 strategic nuclear missiles which it is due to hand over to Russia for destruction by the end of the year as part of the START-1 strategic arms reduction treaty .
