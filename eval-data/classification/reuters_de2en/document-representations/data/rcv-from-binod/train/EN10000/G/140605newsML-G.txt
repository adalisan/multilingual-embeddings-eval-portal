a federal grand jury on Thursday indicted a former Cuban Interior Ministry official on air piracy charges for a July hijacking in which a Cuban plane was forced to land at the U.S. Guantanamo Bay military base . 
the indictment charged Jose Leonardo Fernandez Pupo &quot; did knowingly and unlawfully seize and exercise control &quot; over the small commercial plane &quot; by force and threat of force and by other forms of intimidation , &quot; including discharging a firearm . 
the aircraft , a Cuban Aero taxi , departed Bayamo , Cuba on July 7 and was scheduled to fly to three Cuban cities . 
but the plane was diverted to the U.S. 
Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay , where Fernandez Pupo sought asylum . 
justice Department spokesman Bert Brandenburg said Fernandez Pupo , 52 , has been in custody at the military base until Thursday , when he was flown to Washington , D.C. to face the criminal charges . 
another Justice Department official said a court hearing in the case is expected on Friday . 
Cuba last month said it cooperated in allowing U.S. officials to investigate the hijacking , but it still wanted Fernandez Pupo returned , arguing that failure to do so would violate a 1995 bilateral migration accord . 
Cuba has branded Fernandez Pupo a &quot; traitor . 
the air piracy charge carries a minimum punishment of 20 years in prison upon conviction .
