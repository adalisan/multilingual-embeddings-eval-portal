with just a week left in the 1996 trading year , the South Korean market is fighting against a tide of supply pressure , high interest rates , a floundering won , and an uncertain economic outlook , analysts said on Wednesday . 
but investors with long-term horizons may profit from the downturn , which has seen many blue chip prices tumble , they said . 
the composite stock index has lost 25 percent since the beginning of the year . 
it closed Wednesday at 661.39 points , falling for the sixth consecutive session . 
analysts said the bourse was unlikely to significantly improve until the second half of next year , when many expect a turnaround in the economy . 
&quot; The current account is worsening , Korean industries are not competitive ... But the economy is expected to pick up in the second half , when cyclical pressures ease and corporate earnings improve , &quot; said Seong C. Gweon , an economist and correspondent for the Joong-ang Daily News . 
but some investors saw the decline as a signal to start looking for bargains . 
at a Merrill Lynch presentation on Tuesday , regional strategist Pauline Gatley said South Korea was among Merrill &apos;s favourites . 
although not for the &quot; faint-hearted &quot; investor , the nation was poised for a cyclical rebound in the second half of next year , she said . 
poor sentiment was a key factor pushing down Seoul shares , analysts said . 
&quot; Obviously the market is cheap only if investors are confident that the market will recover , &quot; said Lim Chun-soo , head of research at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Seoul . 
&quot; In order for the market to recover , we have to see recovery in the trade balance , corporate earnings and global demand for certain products , &quot; he said . 
South Korea &apos;s customs-cleared trade deficit is forecast to reach about $ 19 billion in 1996 , up from $ 10.1 billion last year , according to the Trade Ministry . 
the shortfall was blamed mainly on a slump in semiconductor exports . 
chip shipments this year fell to $ 18 billion , compared with the projection of $ 30.7 billion made in January , the ministry said . 
the depreciation of the won by about eight percent against the U.S. dollar this year has scared away foreign investors , analysts said . 
benchmark three-year corporate bond yields are around 12.6 percent , close to the year-high of 12.65 . 
the government has tried to improve the market without directly intervening , brokers said . 
on Monday , it announced a series of market boosting measures , including liberalising interest rates on customer deposits at securites houses , and easing the maturity period and interest rates on loans for margin trading . 
on Wednesday , the Finance Ministry called a meeting of pension fund managers to urge that they buy 300 billion won in stocks by the end of the year .
