the Mediterranean was the star of the crude tanker market on Thursday as rates for 80,000 tonne vessels rose further after spectacular gains on Wednesday , brokers said . 
Cross-Med ships were fixed at up to W170 , from the W155 seen on Wednesday when rates rose about 50 points , on continued high demand and an acute shortage of tonnage , they added . 
&quot; There are a lot of orders , especially for prompt positions and end-January / early February . 
most ships have disappeared . 
if there is just one left it will get good money , &quot; an Italian broker said . 
&quot; The only fresh news is in the Med market , &quot; he added , noting that rates in other sectors were flat . 
the Middle East market showed little change with very large crude carriers ( VLCCs ) westwards fixed at W55 and to Japan around W65 , while VLCCs on transatlantic voyages continued at about W62.5 from the North Sea to the U.S. and from West Africa . 
rates for 130,000 tonners from West Africa showed a firmer tone . 
although W95 was still being done on West Africa / U.S. 
TRIPS , one broker said rates were date-sensitive with slightly higher numbers seem for later fixtures , especially to Asia . 
&quot; You can &apos;t find the ships to China and Korea , &quot; he added . 
Inter-U.K. / CONT rates for 80,000 tonners were steady at around W115 , brokers said .
