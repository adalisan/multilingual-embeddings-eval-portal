President Fidel Ramos warned foreigners on Wednesday that he would not tolerate meddling in the Philippines &apos; internal affairs during the APEC summit he will host this month . 
Ramos said his government would use &quot; maximum tolerance &quot; in dealing with meetings organised by non-governmental groups opposed to APEC &quot; so that Filipinos can do their thing whether it is for , against , parallel to or supportive of the official APEC summit meeting . 
&quot; The only reservation we put forth very strongly was that foreigners must not interfere with the internal affairs of the Philippines , &quot; he told his weekly news conference . 
Ramos has barred the entry of Nobel peace prize laureate and East Timorese activist Jose Ramos-Horta on grounds his presence in Manila this month might disrupt the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum scheduled for November 25 . 
Ramos has also authorised the immigration bureau to keep out any potential foreign trouble-makers during the summit to be held in nearby Subic Bay and APEC ministerial meetings to be held in Manila before the leaders &apos; conference . 
a group organising a counter-APEC meeting said on Wednesday they planned to invite controversial outside speakers to their meeting despite their being rebuffed in the case of Ramos-Horta . 
organisers of the &quot; Manila People &apos;s Forum on APEC &quot; ( MPFA ) said they would invite a &quot; high official &quot; of the East Timorese independence movement and an Indonesian dissident to attend their November 21-23 conference . 
in lieu of Ramos-Horta , MPFA organisers said they had invited another &quot; high official &quot; of the East Timorese independence movement and possibly four other members . 
dissident Indonesian academic George Aditjondro , now exiled in Australia , had also been invited , MPFA &apos;s Walden bello said . 
the group is opposed to APEC &apos;s policies in favour of liberalising trade on the grounds workers will lose wages and the environment will suffer . 
&quot; Our delegates ... are not threats to national security and we fully expect the Philippine government not to bar their entry , &quot; bello told a news conference . 
&quot; We will be able to test this ban in the next few days . 
bello described Aditjondro as a scholar who &quot; is by no means anybody who can be classified as a terrorist except in the eyes of the Indonesian government &quot; . 
he refused to identify the East Timorese leader , saying , &quot; We want to make sure this person can enter the country but we can assure you this person will be there . 
Indonesian President Suharto is among the leaders of 18 APEC member economies expected to attend the summit . 
Indonesia invaded East Timor , a former Portuguese colony in 1975 , and annexed it the following year in a move never recognised by the United Nations . 
immigration officials on Tuesday initially barred entry to two South African unionists invited by another group to attend &quot; anti-imperialist &quot; peasants meeting in Manila , but allowed them in after holding them for six hours .
