on the eve of talks with Jordan &apos;s King Hussein , President Bill Clinton on Monday received a &quot; sober &quot; report on the condition of the Middle East peace process from U.S. diplomatic troubleshooter Dennis Ross . 
Ross held two days of talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week aimed at keeping the latest tensions between them from destroying a fragile reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians . 
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Ross &apos;s report on the talks had been &quot; a sober one , but also one that as always in the Middle East peace process contains in the dark clouds the silver linings that encourage those who work to create peace , gives them the will to try harder . 
McCurry said Ross and other U.S. officials would continue to be in contact with Netanyahu and Arafat &quot; encouraging dialogue between them . 
&quot; And he said Netanyahu was expected to visit Washington to see representatives of the American Jewish community next week and might meet Clinton at that time . 
at the United Nations , Secretary-General Kofi Annan , with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright by his side , said : 
&quot; The peace process is at a difficult stage and we are doing whatever we can to get it back on track again . 
I would appeal to all sides to avoid any initiatives that would jeopardise the process further . 
so I hope we will find ways and means of de-escalating the tensions . 
McCurry sought to avoid attaching an aura of crisis to Clinton &apos;s meeting with Hussein , which was postponed from March 18 after an apparently deranged Jordanian soldier killed seven Israeli schoolgirls in a border incident . 
Hussein , who underwent a medical checkup at Minnesota &apos;s Mayo Clinic last week , is &quot; here in the United States on an unrelated matter and will take the opportunity to visit with the president of the United States , as he almost always does , &quot; McCurry said . 
Israeli-Palestinian talks have been frozen since Netanyahu two weeks ago broke ground for new Jewish settlements in Arab East Jerusalem , triggering West Bank violence that continued on Monday for a 12th day . 
Palestinians say the project violates an Oslo peace accords commitment to decide Jerusalem &apos;s future in final status negotiations . 
the crisis deepened following a March 20 suicide bombing at a Tel Aviv cafe that killed three Israelis . 
Israel accused Arafat of giving a tacit &quot; green light &quot; for militant attacks . 
Clinton &apos;s meeting with Hussein is the fourth with Middle East leaders , including Netanyahu , Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , over the past two months designed to give the peace process new impetus even before the latest difficulties . 
a White House official said Clinton and the Jordanian monarch would explore ideas for reviving the peace process . 
he also predicted Clinton would publicly single out Hussein &apos;s bended-knee request for forgiveness from the families of the murdered schoolgirls as the kind of &quot; personal reaching across the divide &quot; needed to restore momentum to negotiations . 
the United States implicitly rebuked Arab states for their decision on Monday to stop normal relations with Israel , saying improved ties would serve the cause of peace better . 
Arab League foreign ministers , after a two-day meeting in Cairo , said they would bring back an old economic boycott of the Jewish state , close down Israeli missions and withdraw from multilateral talks on Middle East peace . 
but State Department spokesman John Dinger said the U.S. view was &quot; quite clear , and that is that sustaining a regional environment supportive of peace-making is an essential part of promoting peace in the area . 
&quot; We hope that the Arab League recognises that it has a responsibility to shape such an environment , &quot; Dinger told a State Department news briefing .
