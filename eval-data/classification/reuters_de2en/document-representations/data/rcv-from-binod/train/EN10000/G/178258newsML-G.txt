a summit of European leaders ended in discontent on Saturday when Albania said it would oppose Yugoslavia &apos;s membership in the Central European Initiative ( CEI ) unless it agreed to bilateral talks on Kosovo . 
&quot; We have the right not to allow their membership in the CEI , &quot; Albanian Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi told reporters after the two-day summit of the 16-member group . 
&quot; ( They have to agree to ) not only bilateral talks but to make some solutions . 
Albania accuses Serbian-led rump Yugoslavia of mounting agression against ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo region , where violence has flared up repeatedly over recent months . 
in its final communique , the CEI failed to mention the Kosovo issue , after a proposal to do so was voted down by the Slovak delegation , Meksi said . 
the CEI , a loosely-knit group formed in 1989 after the collapse of Communism , requires unanimous decisions . 
the communique instead stressed the need for boosting regional cooperation , particularly in transport and energy , combating organised crime and protecting the environment . 
but while the issue of minority rights in the politically sensitive Balkan region seemed to have been high up on the agenda of the leader &apos;s closed-door meetings , there appeared to be strong opposition to taking a public stance on the topic . 
&quot; I have to warn against overestimating some efforts to get strongly involved in such sensitive issues as the protection of rights of minorities ... In Europe there are other institutions fully qualified to work in these areas , &quot; Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus told the meeting in the southern town of Graz . 
rump Yugoslavia is scheduled to become the group &apos;s 17th and final member after Moldova joined the group at the weekend . 
Belgrade has yet to present its formal application . 
Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky , the meeting &apos;s host , appeared eager to tone down the disagreement . 
&quot; We have made a note that there still is a situation in Kosovo that gives rise to concern to some members , &quot; he told a news conference . 
Croatian Prime Minister Zlatko Matesa added fuel to the simmering row over the CEI &apos;s declared aim to foster regional cooperation , reiterating his country &apos;s stern refusal to be pushed into a closer alliance with rump Yugoslavia , from which broke lose after a bloody war in 1991 . 
&quot; We support any type of cooperative movement of goods and people and even capital but we don &apos;t want to enter political organisations that are against our interest , &quot; he told Reuters . 
leaders of former Yugoslav republics told the summit stability in their region was still far from a reality and that reconstruction efforts had to be stepped up to ensure lasting peace after last year &apos;s U.S. brokered Dayton accord ended 43 months of ethnic war . 
the central and eastern European heads of government &quot; emphasised the importance of economic development for a successful implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords in Bosnia and Herzegovina &quot; , their communique said . 
&quot; They agreed that special attention and priority should be given to projects of reconstruction of the war-torn areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia , &quot; it said . 
Vranitzky said the IFOR peacekeeping force should not be withdrawn from former Yugoslavia , although its mandate ends next month . 
&quot; The international community cannot and will not abandon Bosnia after the expiry of the IFOR mandate by the end of the year , &quot; he said . 
Bosnia will take over the rotating chairmanship of the CEI and will host a &apos; s summit next year in Sarajevo . 
&quot; We hope all members will understand the difficulty and problems that we are working under , &quot; Prime Minister Hasan Muratovic said .
