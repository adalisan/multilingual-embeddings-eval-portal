President Lee Teng-hui pledged on Monday to reunify Taiwan with China but blamed the &quot; stubborn policy &quot; of the Communist mainland &apos;s leadership for a stalemate in once-warming relations . 
Lee , addressing a meeting of the National reunification Council , reiterated Taiwan &apos;s long-standing policy that reunification was a &quot; historic mission &quot; . 
the council is composed of ranking government officials , opposition leaders and independent scholars . 
Lee criticised Beijing for a sharp downturn in what had been warming ties in June 1995 -- a setback that China blamed on Lee &apos;s visit to the United States . 
&quot; Last year could have been a major turning point for the development of national reunification . 
regrettably , the Chinese Communist authorities did not realise the situation , &quot; Lee said . 
&quot; They adopted a hegemonic attitude and stubborn policy toward Taiwan , singlehandedly blocked the development of history and caused the stalemate of cross-Strait relations , &quot; Lee said . 
Lee has regularly called on Beijing to acknowledge the existence of his estranged Republic of China government as a crucial step towards ending their half-century-old differences . 
but a furious Beijing said Lee &apos;s U.S. visit proved that Lee actually coveted Taiwan &apos;s independence , not reunification . 
China broke off semi-official talks with Taipei and rattled Taiwan with war games and missile tests in waters near the Nationalist-ruled island in the months before its first direct presidential elections in March , which Lee won by a landslide . 
Lee said Taipei was committed to peaceful reunification , but that the interests of Taiwan &apos;s people must come first . 
Taiwan is ruled by the government that lost a civil war to the Chinese Communists in 1949 and fled into exile on the island . 
both sides say they want unification but under very different terms . 
Beijing views Taiwan as a rebel-held province and vehemently opposes Taipei &apos;s effort to break its international isolation , threatening to retake the island by force if it opts for formal independence . 
&quot; Communist China &apos;s high-handed policy ... will deepen meaningless misunderstandings and hostility . 
it is detrimental to the development of reunification , &quot; Lee said . 
&quot; The pursuit of China &apos;s reunification is our historic responsibility , but the security and welfare of the 21.3 million in Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen ( Jinmen ) and Matsu ( Mazu ) are the fundamental issues of our survival , &quot; Lee said , listing the four islands that since 1949 have resisted communist rule . 
&quot; Our mainland policy will be aimed at keeping our roots in Taiwan , &quot; Lee said . 
Taipei and Beijing should tolerate and respect each other and step up communication and dialogue to create favourable conditions for reunification , Lee said . 
on a softer tone , Lee reiterated his willingness to embark upon a &quot; journey of peace &quot; to China to meet with top leaders in Beijing for a direct exchange of views . 
Beijing has given a cool response to Lee &apos;s proposal .
