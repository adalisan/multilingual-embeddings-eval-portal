state-owned National Food Authority ( NFA ) concluded a contract for 100,000 tonnes yellow corn with Top Glory Trading Co , representative of the National Cereals , Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corp of China on Thursday , the official said . 
&quot; The NFA merely facilitated the importation for the private sector , &quot; the official who requested not to be named told Reuters . 
&quot; Under the contract , the Philippine government was given an option to import an additional 10 percent of its actual order , &quot; the official added . 
delivery of the commodity is set between February 20 and March 25 . 
local poultry and livestock firms have asked the govt to import corn due to a local shortfall . 
&quot; We are willing to pay a premium to be able to import corn because of the lack of local supply , &quot; said an official at the Philippine Association of Feed Millers Inc . 
the official said he expected local corn shortfall this year to reach one million tonnes . 
but Agriculture Secretary Salvador Escudero said he expected Philippine corn imports this year to reach 500,000 tonnes to address the local shortfall . 
local grains traders also said NFA has started negotiations for the importation of rice this year . 
in Bangkok , Thailand &apos;s Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn said on Thursday the Philippines is to buy 205,000 tonnes of 25 percent grade Thai rice . 
Prachuab just returned from a trip to Manila . 
Prachuab did not provide details on prices and shipment but said the deal would be on cash basis and not be a part of any counter-trade arrangement . 
grains traders from Vietnam also said they were expecting news to emerge soon of a possible deal between the Philippines and Vietnam , involving the purchase of as much as 200,000-300,000 tonnes of rice . 
&quot; We have not concluded any deal with Vietnam . 
that &apos;s not true , &quot; the Agriculture official . 
Escudero said in a previous interview he expected the country to import between 300,000 and 500,000 tonnes of rice this year .
