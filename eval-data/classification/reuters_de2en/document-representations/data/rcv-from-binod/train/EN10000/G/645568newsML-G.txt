Grenoble , France , June 8 ( Reuter ) - Briton Chris Boardman won the prologue of the Dauphine Libere for the fourth consecutive year in the streets of Grenoble on Sunday . 
the world one hour record holder confirmed he was the best time trial specialist in the world , covering the 5.1-km flat course in five minutes 50 seconds , at an average speed of 52.433 kph . 
last year &apos;s Tour of Spain winner Alex Zuelle of Switzerland was second , three seconds behind , and another time trial specialist , Russian Viacheslav Yekimov , was third in the same time . 
I feel I &apos;m ready , &quot; said Boardman , who aims to put two consecutive disappointments in the Tour de France behind when he competes in the event next month . 
but Boarmdan , who won the Dauphine Libere in 1994 , said he did not consider the race as mere preparation for the Tour . 
it &apos;s like a small Tour de France in the mountains . 
it &apos;s special to me since it &apos;s the first stage race I &apos;ve ever won .
