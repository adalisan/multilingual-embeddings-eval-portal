Zairean rebels are stopping aid agencies from entering South Kivu region to look for up to half a million refugees missing since last month , aid officials said on Wednesday . 
but the U.N. reports more than 100,000 of the missing refugees could be on the move north towards Goma from South Kivu &apos;s regional capital Bukavu . 
rebels have blocked all attempts by the U.N. and aid agencies to enter Bukavu or Uvira to look for the refugees who fled fighting between ethnic Tutsi rebels and the Zairean army . 
aid efforts are hampered by the fact that the only border crossing at Uvira was landmined by the Zairean army during its retreat last month . 
&quot; The Banyamulenge ( Zairean rebels ) have indicated through contacts that they have no intention in letting anybody including the U.N. come across , &quot; Gary Miller , Burundi country director of Medecins sans Frontieres ( Doctors Without Borders ) Holland said in a telephone interview . 
aid workers link the denial of access to continued insecurity in South Kivu , but they also say rebel leaders based around Goma could want to postpone the issue of the South Kivu refugees . 
&quot; It is a question of the administrative structure which has to be established by the ( rebels ) . 
as soon as the administrative structure is set up on the other side then we can start talking , &quot; UNHCR Burundi representative Hitoshi mise said . 
diplomats say the rebels , whose leaders are based in Goma several hundred kilometres north , may be &quot; marking time &quot; until the position of the Goma refugees becomes clearer . 
in all 700,000 Hutu refugees who fled fighting between ethnic Tutsi rebels and the Zairean army are missing in eastern Zaire since 500,000 walked back into Rwandan from Goma between November 15 and 19 . 
around 200,000 Rwandans refugees from Goma camps are unaccounted for . 
the U.N. &apos; s World Food Programme ( WFP ) reported &quot; strong indications &quot; that at least 100,000 refugees were heading north from Bukavu and could arrive around Goma by Thursday . 
&quot; There are strong indications that a large movement of people from the Bukavu area are heading north towards Goma . 
we believe that there could be more than 100,000 , &quot; WFP spokeswoman Michele Quintaglie said in Nairobi . 
Quintaglie said it was a mystery why the 100,000 chose to walk the 120 km ( 75 miles ) to Goma rather than cross straight into southern Rwanda from Bukavu at Cyangugu . 
&quot; But the WFP is shifting some of its operations from Cyangugu back to Gisenyi , &quot; she said . 
if confirmed the WFP report would account for some of the 380,000 refugees stranded in the Bukavu area . 
it could also suggest a strategy in which rebels , blocking access to South Kivu , attempted to direct refugees north to the Rwandan border at Goma . 
UNHCR , acknowledging its lack of concrete information , estimates around 380,000 Rwandan Hutus could be stranded near Bukavu and a further 100,000 Burundian Hutus are missing from Uvira camps . 
a total of 225,000 Rwandan and Burundian Hutus fled fighting last month around Uvira between ethnic Tutsi Zairean rebels who now control much of East Zaire and the Zairean army . 
around 30,000 Burundian refugees have since returned home while around 4,000 have arrived in Kigoma , western Tanzania , after crossing Lake Tanganyika by boat .
