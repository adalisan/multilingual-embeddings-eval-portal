there &apos;s a place called The blob , another known as Blow-Me-Down bluff and a prominent rock outcrop called sore Thumb because it sticks out like one in the frozen wilderness . 
no other spot in the world has such odd names as Antarctica , where a century of explorers , adventurers and researchers have let their imaginations run riot when it comes to putting a moniker to a mountain or a label to a glacier . 
names range from whimsical to weird , from inspired to insipid . 
there &apos;s Mt . 
Wyatt , named by an admirer after 1950s Hollywood actress Jane Wyatt , a conical peak known as The Pimple , and a pair of rocky pinnacles known as The Office Girls , named by appreciative U.S. surveyors in honour of the secretarial staff back home . 
other names seem to reflect the explorers &apos; state of mind as they made their way through this vast , ice-bound continent -- exasperation Inlet , deception Island , despair rocks . 
all these names appear in &quot; Geographic Names of the Antarctic , &quot; an 834-page catalogue published by the U.S. government and containing the definitive and internationally recognised list of Antarctic toponyms . 
the book gives all the rules and regulations for putting titles to as-yet unnamed geographical features , and experts say there are plenty left . 
&quot; There was this frenzy to name things a few decades back but it &apos;s cooled off now , &quot; said Anthony Amos , a University of Texas meteorologist and Antarctic veteran . 
&quot; There are lots of places that have no name . 
Central Antarctica is nearly devoid of them . 
in theory , anyone can submit an &quot; Antarctic Place Name Proposal , &quot; but applicants must supply detailed reasons for the choice , plus charts , surveys and other supporting documents . 
the process is not always easy or fast . 
Amos and University of Hawaii oceanographer David Karl are still waiting for an answer to their proposal to give the name Santa Claus Island to a remote rock where they have studied the effects of sea ice on plankton populations . 
not just whimsical , their proposal is an approximate acronym for Studies in Antarctic coupled linkages Among Micro-U Organisms . 
they have already succeeded in dubbing another spot Racer Rock , an acronym for Research on Antarctic Coastal Ecosystems and Rates . 
some kinds of names are unacceptable -- no names of pets or of commercial sponsors , and you cannot name a feature after yourself . 
someone else has to name it for you . 
decisions on whether to accept a name are made by a seven-person committee including members from the U.S. National Science Foundation , the Library of Congress and the Defence Mapping Agency . 
other countries have their own committees , which apply more or less the same criteria . 
every country with a presence in Antarctica has put its own distinctive stamp on the continent through the names it has given . 
the French have a penchant for naming places after family members , like Marguerite Bay , which explorer Jean Charcot gallantly named for his wife in 1909 . 
the Americans like to name things after not just the powerful and famous but ordinary folk . 
mount Smart is named for the cook on a 1965 expedition , and Mom Peak was named after Shirley Anderson of San Diego , widely known as the &quot; Antarctic Mom &quot; because her radio chats used to cheer up U.S. personnel during the long Antarctic winter , the book says . 
for flights of pure fancy , no one beats the British . 
they named one group of islands after characters in Charles Dickens &apos; novel &quot; Pickwick Papers &quot; and named features in another area after famous opera composers -- Mozart Ice Piedmont , Rossini Point , Verdi Inlet . 
the New Zealanders named a spot after their famous rugby team , the All-Blacks Nunataks , while the Latin Americans have a preference for military figures . 
Sepulveda Point was named for a Chilean navy lieutenant and Lanusse Bay is a tribute to Argentina &apos;s first naval aviator on the continent . 
Norwegian explorer L.A. Larsen is the champion of Antarctic tributes . 
he has 12 places named after him including an ice shelf and a glacier . 
U.S. explorer Nathaniel Palmer , often credited with being the first person to set foot on Antarctica , has six including scientific base Palmer Station . 
not all names stick . 
one peninsula was confused with another place and mistakenly carried its name for years until the error was discovered and the place rechristened . 
its new name ? 
misnomer Point .
