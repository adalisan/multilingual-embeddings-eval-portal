Australian Treasury Secretary Ted Evans said on Thursday that it was not clear there was a case for tighter fiscal policy , particularly with high unemployment . 
Evans said the government &apos;s 1997 / 98 budget which reduced the underlying budget deficit and continued the strategy begun in the 1996 / 97 budget kept the focus on the medium term . 
&quot; While there will always be a case for greater fiscal consolidation , it is not clear that there is a case for further accelerating consolidation , particularly with unemployment as high as it is , &quot; Evans said in a speech to business economists . 
&quot; Thus it was sensible to retrieve the slippage identified in the January 1997 mid-year review in 1998 / 99 , rather than in 1997 / 98 when substantial fiscal consolidation measures announced in last year &apos;s budget are still to come into effect , &quot; he said . 
Evans said the budget &apos;s medium term focus was an attempt to minimise over-reaction to short term fluctuations and to address those issues which might help ensure that the cycle is prolonged well into the medium term . 
experience showed that the fiscal consolidation in prospect within the government &apos;s projection period , to 2000 / 01 ( June 30 ) would be needed as a buffer against cyclical developments . 
&quot; For this and other reasons , there is thus a premium on our prolonging the cycle -- on avoiding extremes , either in policy application or in outcomes , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The medium term focus of macro-economic policies is driven by that objective . 
in its 1997 / 98 budget , the government forecast an underlying budget deficit of A $ 3.9 billion for the year to June 30 , 1998 , compared with a estimated deficit of A $ 6.9 billion in 1996 / 97 . 
the 1997 / 98 budget has been criticised by some in the business community as a missed opportunity , as it contained no policy surprises . 
&quot; One favourable implicaiton of this medium term focus of fiscal policy is that there should be fewer surprises in each annual budget , &quot; Evans said . 
&quot; It is thus a little ironic that so many commentators and analysts appear to have been surprised by the absence of surprises in this budget , &quot; Evans said . 
he also noted the budget &apos;s references to the role of structural reform in lifting the limits of growth , and thus reducing unemployment and inequality . 
&quot; In particular , it highlights the importance and interrelation of competition , productivity and competitiveness ; and makes the simple but crucial point that while lack of competitiveness will stifle growth , achieving competitivness , in a global environment , will reduce demand side constraints - 
leaving growth constrained only by a factor availability ; the Asian experience if we are interested , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Are there limits to this process ? 
in the medium term , no . 
&quot; In the short term , the persistence of structural rigidities in one area will limit the benefits of reform elsewhere , &quot; he sadi . 
&quot; This explains the observed superior performance of comprehensive reform approaches , &quot; he added . 
&quot; Equally , it explains why there are benefits in persisting with reforms in areas with economy-wide effects ; labour markets , tax systems , competition policy , communications and transportation , &quot; he said .
