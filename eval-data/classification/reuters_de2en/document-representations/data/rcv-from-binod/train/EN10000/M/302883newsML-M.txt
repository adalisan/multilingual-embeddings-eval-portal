continued profit-taking in blue chips and secondaries which made healthy gains earlier on Monday saw Jakarta shares closing lower , brokers said . 
the Jakarta composite Index fell 1.78 points , or 0.27 percent , to close at 656.09 points but recovered from a low of 655.12 points . 
Decliners outpaced advancers 52 to 41 , with 71 counters unchanged . 
total volume was 133.5 million shares on a turnover of 284.98 billion rupiah . 
brokers said the market was likely to be mixed on Tuesday as some investors were expected to continue making one-day forays due to the lack of fresh leads . 
&quot; Active buying of some fundamentally-sound stocks failed to push the index into positive field as many sellers were cashing in their profits today , &quot; a broker with foreign firm said . 
brokers said speculative buying in the late session in counters such as Barito Pacific , Summarecon and Kalbe Farma had prevented the index from further falling . 
timber firm Barito Pacific topped the active list with 28 million shares traded , rising 17.74 percent , or 275 rupiah to 1,825 rupiah on a spate of rumours including acquisitions and that the company had just secured a big loan , brokers said . 
they said the counter also attracted attention on talk that President Suharto &apos;s eldest daughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana was planning to buy a large stake in the firm . 
a Barito official declined to comment on the rumours but said the market had possibly started to realise the value of the stock . 
another broker , however , attributed the rise to market talk of expected strong earnings in 1996 after reports of a rise in Indonesia &apos;s forestry exports last year . 
Indonesia &apos;s export earnings from the forestry sector rose to $ 8.3 billion in 1996 from $ 7.1 billion in 1995 . 
pharmaceutical producer Kalbe Farma was actively traded on speculative interest following talk that a company might buy a large stake in the firm , brokers said . 
company officials were not immediately available for comment . 
Kalbe Farma rose 150 rupiah to 3,100 on 1.7 million shares . 
Paper producer Tjiwi Kimia rose 50 rupiah to 2,500 on 2.3 million shares on news that it would benefit from a sustained high global pulp inventory . 
&quot; We expect pulp prices to either remain stagnant or drop through the year , while regional paper prices remain strong , &quot; peregrine Sewu Securities said in its weekly report . 
peregrine said the trend was bad news for Indonesian pulp producers such as Indorayon and Indah Kiat . 
however , it said , the trend should benefit margins and earnings for paper producer Tjiwi Kimia . 
Bank Negara Indonesia , Bank Servitia , Telkom and Bimantara Citra were among the targets of profit-takers , brokers said . 
Bank Negara Indonesia fell 25 rupiah to 1,275 on 13.1 million shares , while Bank Servitia eased to 1,025 rupiah on 1.8 million shares after rising to 1,050 earlier . 
heavyweights telecommunications firm Telkom and conglomerate Bimantara Citra were easier at the close after early gains . 
Telkom closed at 4,200 on 4.3 million shares after rising 25 rupiah to 4,225 in the morning , while Bimantara closed at 3,150 on 1.1 million shares after rising to 3,175 rupiah earlier . 
cement maker semen Gresik rose 100 rupiah to 7,425 rupiah before closing at 7,325 rupiah on 1.8 million shares on selling pressure from profit-takers , brokers said . 
brokers said sentiment on the counter was boosted earlier by news that the firm would announce this week its December sales and projections for 1997 , coupled with news that its units PT semen Tonasa and semen Padang were among five cement producers allowed by the government to export 215,000 tonnes in the first quarter .
