options related selling kept Hong Kong gold dealers busy on an otherwise slow Friday , dealers in the colony said . 
Bullion prices moved up to US $ 370 an ounce in early trading before coming back to settle on $ 369.30 / 80 . 
this was slightly up on New York &apos;s overnight close on Thursday of $ 368.90 / 369.40 . 
&quot; There &apos;s a COMEX options expiry tonight , with the gold number at $ 370 , so we could see some choppy activity , though I expect they will try to keep it as close to $ 370 as possible , &quot; a dealer at a North American bank said . 
Australian producer liquidation for year-end book squaring kept some buoyancy in the market as did rumoured European central bank selling , dealing sources said . 
but with Christmas approaching and the Dow Jones Industrial index having already taken a fall this week , tight range-bound trading between $ 368 and $ 371 was seen continuing . 
any more falls on Wall Street would give gold some much-needed impetus to go up , one source said . 
but he added that gold prices in Asia were being held down , with no reason for a lift in the immediate term . 
the carryover charge at the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society rose to -5.49 from its previous fix at -6.0 .
