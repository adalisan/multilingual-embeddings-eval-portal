it has been another tough day for Mohammed whose shop is hidden down a twisting alley of Kano &apos;s ancient market in northern Nigeria . 
&quot; We have nothing here , only poverty . 
that &apos;s why people join in when the Brothers riot , &quot; he says . 
for the Moslem Brothers , with their home-grown Shi &apos;ite philosophy , the answer to Nigeria &apos;s problems is an Iranian style revolution to overthrow the military government and install Islamic Sharia law . 
when he was in school Mohammed wanted to be an accountant . 
now he &apos;s 28 , he sells cloth , and not very much of it . 
&quot; I must sympathise with them , the Brothers are our friends , &quot; he said . 
at least seven people died in September in clashes between Shi &apos;ites and police . 
the Shi &apos;ites say the death toll is much higher , claiming that more than 30 died in separate incidents . 
the trigger for the violence was the arrest of charismatic Shi &apos;ite leader Ibrahim Yakub El-Zak-Zaky , 43 , on charges of producing inflammatory leaflets , running an illegal radio station and trying to import arms . 
&quot; People will protest about anything right now , they don &apos;t have enough to eat , &quot; Sheikh Gumbi , a prominent Islamic scholar told Reuters in the northern city of Kaduna . 
&quot; This is a major crisis , and if it continues it will spread to so many places . 
the arid north has always been the poorest part of Africa &apos;s most populous nation . 
oil money has flowed from the south , but many northerners do not notice the benefit . 
&quot; The whole state of the economy , the lack of work , the lack of recreation , the lack of direction has encouraged people to follow El-Zak-Zaky , &quot; Bala Usman , history professor at Zaria university told Reuters . 
Islam &apos;s presence in Nigeria was consolidated during another period of poverty and despair at the start of the early 19th century by jihad revolutionary Usman Dan Fodio . 
but Moslems make up only about half of Nigeria &apos;s 100 million people , and most of the Moslems are Sunni , not Shi &apos;ite . 
it was only in the 1970s that Shi &apos;ite groups , including El-Zak Zaky &apos;s surfaced . 
since the Iranian revolution in 1979 they have grown more influential . 
&quot; Every Friday for the past six months they have fought with other Moslems in the mosques , wanting their preachers to take over , &quot; Usman said . 
&quot; They record the fighting on video cameras to send to Iran , and justify their funding . 
any kind of instability in the north is an unwelcome prospect for Nigeria &apos;s ruling generals . 
&quot; If they break the laws of the land we are ready to break their necks , &quot; warned Kaduna police commissioner Yakubu Shaibu . 
Nigeria has been in political crisis since 1993 , when a previous military government annulled elections that would have ended a decade of army rule . 
strikes and riots followed the detention of the presumed winner , millionaire Moslem businessman Moshood Abiola in 1994 , but were largely confined to his southwestern homeland . 
&quot; We have had enough of religious trouble in the north , unless stern measures are taken from the onset ... it could spread like wildfire , &quot; said Tanko Yakasai , a northern politician who backs the military &apos;s plan to hand over rule to civilians by October 1998 . 
&quot; Whenever there is no political activity in Nigeria the vacuum can attract anyone . 
the sooner political parties are out the sooner this will be abandoned , &quot; he added . 
with El-Zak Zaky jailed and at least 35 other members arrested for their part in the riots , the leadership of the Moslem Brothers has now been driven underground . 
&quot; We are just trying to continue with our programme as usual , teaching Islamic philosophy and working to deliver Nigeria from this corrupt system of government , &quot; spokesman Mohammed Ciroma said by telephone from Zaria . 
he has since been arrested .
