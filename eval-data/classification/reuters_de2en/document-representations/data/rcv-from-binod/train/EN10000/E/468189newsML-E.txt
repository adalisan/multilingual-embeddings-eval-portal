index ( base 100 = 86 ) 129.8 129.7 129.8 
intermediate goods + 0.2 -1.3 
finished goods + 0.1 + 2.1 
the IPPI reflects the prices producers receive as goods leave their plants . 
a Reuters survey of economists had forecast that the overall index would fall 1.4 percent in February from January . 
statistics Candaa said the index &apos;s rise was primarily due to the slight rise in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar , which raised the value in Canadian dollars of all export prices quoted in U.S. currency . 
the exchange rate increased the month-to-month change in industrial prices from slightly under zero to an increase of 0.1 percent , the federal agency said . 
the impact was most noticeable for motor vehicles , pulp , paper and wood products . 
the agency said the most important monthly price increases in February were for non-ferrous metal products , motor vehicles and parts , and softwood lumber . 
declines in petroleum products , newsprint and pulp prices partly offset the increases .
