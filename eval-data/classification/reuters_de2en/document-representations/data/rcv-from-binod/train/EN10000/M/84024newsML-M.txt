the overnight funds were opened at 11 percent but sharply came down to four percent due to excess liquidity , a dealer at Standard Chartered Bank said . 
at the end of the day , offers were seen at the level of three percent but no borrowing interest was seen , and the market closed at two percent , the dealer said .
