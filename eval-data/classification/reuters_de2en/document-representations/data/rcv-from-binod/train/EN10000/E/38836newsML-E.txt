the Philippines &apos; central Visayan islands want to increase trade with China , presidential assistant for the region Rhett Pelaez said on Friday . 
&quot; We are looking at China as a major partner . 
last July , we signed a sister province agreement with the province of Hainan , &quot; Pelaez told reporters . 
it has an existing agreement with Xiamen . 
the Visayan region exported $ 3.5 billion worth of products last year , accounting for more than 10 percent of the country &apos;s exports . 
it is strong in the agro-industrial sector and most of its trade was with the United States , Japan , Singapore and Australia , Pelaez said . 
&quot; We are looking at places where we will have a comparative advantage ... where we can complement rather than compete , &quot; he added . 
Pelaez said most of the business opportunities will be in agriculture and agro-industrial enterprises . 
at present , the government is inviting one Chinese oleochemical processor to relocate in the region , he said .
