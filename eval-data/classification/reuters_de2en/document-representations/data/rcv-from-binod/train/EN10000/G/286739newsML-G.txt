fire has destroyed a house in southern Belgium where the bodies of two victims of a child sex abuse ring were found last September , the local fire service said on Friday . 
the empty chalet in Jumet , a suberb of Charleroi , was last lived in by Frenchman Bernard Weinstein , an acquaintance of convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux who is chief suspect in Belgium &apos;s paedophile investigation . 
&quot; The chalet is completely destroyed . 
( the fire ) caught hold very quickly -- it was entirely made of wood , &quot; a fire chief from Charleroi told Belgian RTBF radio , adding that arson was suspected . 
&quot; We &apos;re in the middle of winter , the house was uninhabited - so it was surely set on fire deliberately , &quot; he said . 
the decomposed bodies of teenage friends An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks , missing for a year , were found on September 4 last year under a shed in the grounds of the house . 
later that month more than 3,000 local people signed a petition clammering for the detatched property - which they dubbed the &quot; House of Horror &quot; - be razed to the ground and a memorial to the victims be put in its place . 
Dutroux , who is in jail along with several alleged accomplices , has admitted abducting An and Eefje as well as murdering Weinstein . 
in August Dutroux led police to the bodies of two other girls -- Melissa Russo and Julie Lejeune -- buried alongside Weinstein in the garden of a house Dutroux owned in Sars-La-Buissiere south west of the city . 
the youngsters had gone missing , aged eight , in June 1995 .
