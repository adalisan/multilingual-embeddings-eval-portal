South African stocks fell for the third day running on Wednesday as anxieties over the recent weakness of the rand and confusion over government policy on exchange controls darkened the market &apos;s mood , dealers said . 
an early rally , boosted by U.S. election results that matched market predictions , rapidly turned sour and share prices steadily fell to end in the red near their day lows . 
the all-share index fell 50.1 points to 6,873.9 as industrials tumbled 56.9 points to 8,091.5 . 
the market is concerned about apparent contradictory statements from finance minister Trevor Manuel and Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals on whether the government is committed to a phased withdrawal of controls or may be mulling a &quot; big bang &quot; approach . 
trade was light for most of the day until a huge basket trade involving most shares in the top forty index boosted volumes to healthy levels . 
dealers said the trade , linked to an unnamed international broker , was a sign that futures traders were starting to enter the market in preparation for the contracts close-out in December . 
gold shares also had a miserable day as renewed weakness in the bullion price pushed prices down after a resilient few weeks . 
the gold index finished at 1,702.0 , down 2.19 percent or 38.1 points .
