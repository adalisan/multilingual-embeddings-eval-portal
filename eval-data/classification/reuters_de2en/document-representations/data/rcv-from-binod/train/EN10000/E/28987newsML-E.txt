a rebound in the U.S. manufacturing sector in August marks yet another sign of a strengthening economy which may soon tilt the scales toward a Federal Reserve tightening of credit policy , economists said . 
&quot; All the latest numbers point towards a strengthening U.S. economy , &quot; said David Jones , chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc . &quot; The third quarter started with a whimper , but it looks like it &apos;s going to end with a bang in terms of the economic outlook . 
it looks like the Fed will have to tighten at the September 24 meeting if not before , &quot; he added . 
Jones said forecasters should not rule out the prospects for a between-policy-meetings Fed tightening sometime after crucial August jobs data are released on Friday , September 6 . 
earlier Tuesday , the National Association of Purchasing Management ( NAPM ) reported a rise to 52.6 in its August index of business conditions versus a reading of 50.2 in July . 
after tumbling four points to a reading of 50.2 in July , economists had predicted a rebound to 52.9 last month following last Friday &apos;s strong jump in a regional report . 
the Chicago association of purchasing managers &apos; survey printed 60.0 in August versus 51.2 in July . 
experts agree the latest NAPM report is consistent with a stronger manufacturing sector . 
and other reports such as those on new home sales and auto sales further support the idea of a bouyant economy . 
prior to the NAPM release , market observers were zeroed in on the employment component of the manufacturing report to shed some light on Friday &apos;s August employment data . 
&quot; The employment component fits with a 200,000 payroll employment increase , but it doesn &apos;t give a strong signal that the payrolls number will be higher than that , &quot; said Elliot Platt , director of economic research at Donaldson , Lufkin , and Jenrette Securities Corp. 
in a Reuter poll , U.S. economists expect a 244,000 increase in payrolls for August and expect the unemployment rate to dip to 5.3 percent . 
&quot; From the Federal Reserve &apos;s standpoint , we are still very very contingent on Friday &apos;s ( employment ) numbers . 
he predicted that if payrolls grow by 200,000 or less , the Fed will keep monetary policy unchanged . 
the next meeting of the central bank &apos;s policy-setting Federal Reserve Open Market Committee is scheduled for September 24 .
