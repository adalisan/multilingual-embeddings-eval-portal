finance Minister Alexander Livshits said on Thursday that Russian commercial interest rates could fall to 25 percent per year in 1997 , boosting economic growth . 
&quot; We want a rate of 25 to 30 percent next year . 
after that ... the crisis ends and investment begins , &quot; Livshits said in an interview on NTV commercial television . 
&quot; That is low , but it is possible . 
next year &apos;s slogan is the year of inexpensive credit , &quot; he said , adding that the government would keep inflation low . 
prices fell by 0.2 percent in August , the first drop since market reforms began in 1992 . 
July inflation was also a post-reform low at 0.7 percent . 
much of Russian industry cannot afford to restructure , analysts say , because commercial credit , which typically exceeds the rate on government treasury bills , currently over 60 percent annualised for six-month bills , is too costly . 
economy Minister Yevgeny Yasin has said Russia will not free domestic funds for investment until the government tightens its own belt , decreasing the budget deficit and allowing treasury bill yields to fall . 
when government yields fall , banks will take their money from that market and begin extending commercial loans to make a profit , he said . 
Livshits , reacting to criticism from parliament that the 1997 draft budget had unrealistic expectations for growth next year and afforded too few funds to back it , said Russia would have to stick to tight spending . 
&quot; We have very limited possibilities ( to manoeuvre ) , &quot; he said . 
he refrained from predicting that the Russian parliament would pass the budget law , but said its basic , frugal nature could not be changed . 
&quot; To stray from the basic parameters will not help anyone , &quot; he said .
