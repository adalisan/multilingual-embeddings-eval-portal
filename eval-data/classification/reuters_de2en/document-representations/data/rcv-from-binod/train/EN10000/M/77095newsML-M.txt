Shanghai copper futures ended up on Wednesday due to overnight gains on the London Metal Exchange with many investors offsetting their positions before China &apos;s National Day holiday , traders said . 
the most active January 1997 contract ended at 20,110 yuan ( $ 2,422 ) per tonne , rising 190 yuan . 
it opened at 20,150 yuan , hitting an intra-day low of 20,080 and a high of 20,200 . 
October rose 10 to 20,460 yuan , November 90 to 20,240 , December 190 to 20,150 , February 200 to 20,100 , March 170 to 20,130 and April 240 to 20,150 . 
combined volume rose to 32,740 tonnes from 21,430 . 
copper opened up and moved at that level for most of the session . 
traders said that LME copper breaching the key $ 1,900 resistance level last night triggered short-covering in Shanghai and pushed all the later-maturing contracts above 20,000 yuan . 
&quot; Short-covering was responsible for today &apos;s rises but investors lost short-term direction due to a consolidation on the LME after the breach of the $ 1,900 level , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; The open interest of most contracts fell . 
investors do not want to hold positions during the National Day holiday , &quot; he added . 
the holiday lasts from Sept 30 to Oct 3 . 
traders said that the LME was still a major factor influencing Shanghai copper because of a lack of domestic market-moving news . 
&quot; copper will follow LME &apos;s trend in the next few days with many investors continuing to liquidate their positions with the approach of the holiday , &quot; a second trader said . 
analysts said that copper was likely to test the 20,000-yuan support level in the short term .
