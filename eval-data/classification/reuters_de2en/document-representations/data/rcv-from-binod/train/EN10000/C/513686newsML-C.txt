Microsoft Corp is expected to show a sharp 40 percent jump in quarterly earnings Thursday on strength of the software giant &apos;s core business including the latest upgrade to its best-selling Office suite . 
on average analysts expect the Redmond , Wash.-based company to post earnings of $ 0.64 a share for its fiscal third quarter , compared with $ 0.44 a year ago after adjusting for a split , according to First Call . 
several analysts predicted revenues in the range of $ 2.9 billion , up about 32 percent from last year &apos;s $ 2.2 billion and up from $ 2.68 billion in the December quarter . 
&quot; I think on balance it will be a very good quarter , &quot; said David Readerman , analyst at Montgomery Securities . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see any motivating factor why they should blow the number out . 
in January , Microsoft launched Office 97 , the latest version of its &quot; productivity &quot; applications such as word processing and spreadsheets that accounted for an estimated $ 2 billion of the company &apos;s $ 8.7 billion in fiscal 1996 revenues . 
Microsoft makes the bulk of its money from &quot; platforms &quot; including the operating systems preloaded onto new personal computers , which generate about third of the company &apos;s revenues . 
but analysts said the fastest-growing driver of revenue continues to be the high-end Windows NT operating system and related products for back-end computer servers . 
Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs estimated that Microsoft &apos;s BackOffice business , including NT , would be up 100 percent over the year-earlier quarter and represent about 20 percent of total revenues . 
analysts expect results from the current fourth quarter to be similar to the third , but Microsoft has warned that growth is likely to slow in the fiscal year that begins July 1 . 
&quot; I do expect them to reiterate that fiscal &apos; 98 will represent a period of slower growth for the company , &quot; Sherlund said . 
while Microsoft is still benefiting from a mix shift to its more lucrative Windows 95 and Windows NT systems , analysts said it was not clear how planned updates to the products next year would affect revenues . 
&quot; They &apos;re being very cryptic on pricing , &quot; said analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie . 
he said Microsoft had delayed release of the products in part because corporate customers were becoming confused by the proliferation of Windows flavors . 
nevertheless , McAdams estimated Microsoft &apos;s revenues in fiscal 1998 would rise 27 percent to $ 13.7 billion . 
&quot; The markets they &apos;re playing in could double the size of the company , &quot; he said .
