Manchester United &apos;s proud 40-year-old record of never having lost at home in European competition was shattered on Wednesday when Turkey &apos;s Fenerbahce emerged from Old Trafford with a 1-0 victory . 
United , who had played 26 European Cup ties without defeat in Manchester as well as dozens of UEFA Cup and Cup Winners &apos; Cup matches , dominated much of the Champions &apos; League Group C match without ever playing to their full potential . 
they were punished after 78 minutes when Elvir Bolic broke down the left , making a rare Fenerbahce foray into United territory , and unleashed a hopeful shot from 25 metres . 
the ball ricocheted off the Shin of David May , looped over a static Peter Schmeichel in the United goal and nestled in the back of the net . 
United -- Schmeichel included -- poured forward in the remaining quarter of an hour in search of an equaliser , but the Turks , who had resisted stubbornly throughout , held on to claim a historic victory which rekindles their hopes of qualification for the European Cup quarter-finals . 
&quot; It &apos;s a sad way to end a record with a stupid deflected goal like that , &quot; said United legend Bobby Charlton , veteran of the reds &apos; finest European hour in 1968 , when they lifted their solitary European Cup . 
&quot; Forty years . 
that &apos;s a sensational record . 
&quot; This is a night we won &apos;t ever be allowed to forget , &quot; admitted manager Alex Ferguson . 
&quot; Our intention now has to be to beat Juventus in three weeks . 
Bolic &apos;s goal ensured a dramatic end to a match that started dismally . 
the first half was scrappy with neither side playing with any fluency , particularly around their opponents &apos; penalty area . 
Fenerbahce &apos;s Senturk Kemalettin had the best chance of the half , pouncing on a loose ball in the United area after 13 minutes and rifling a close-range volley over Schmeichel &apos;s crossbar . 
at the other end Eric Cantona and David Beckham squandered half-chances but Ferguson &apos;s men were not reading each other and failed to create any real goal-scoring chances . 
as the half limped to a close , the visiting fans entertained themselves by taunting the Stretford End with chants of Newcastle and Southampton -- the two premier league sides which between them put 11 goals past United in the last fortnight . 
United improved after the interval and , just before the hour , Karel Poborsky put Nicky Butt clean through on goal for United &apos;s best chance of the night . 
but the 21-year-old hit his shot straight at Rustu Recber , and Jordi Cruyff and Butt failed to turn in the loose ball . 
Ferguson made a double-substitution in an attempt to break the deadlock , bringing on Paul Scholes for Poborsky and Ole Solskaer for Cruyff . 
the switch almost reaped immediate dividends when Scholes swung in a cross from the United right which floated over Rustu and bounced off the top of the Fenerbahce crossbar . 
yet just when it seemed a United winner was on the horizon , Bolic struck , stunning the vast majority of the 53,000 strong crowd who witnessed the end of an era .
