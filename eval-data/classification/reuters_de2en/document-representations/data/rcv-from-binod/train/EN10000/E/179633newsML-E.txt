British producer prices edged higher in October , largely due to a surge in oil prices , the Office for National Statistics ( ons ) said Monday . 
financial economists said the figures indicated a modest increase in inflationary pressure in the pipeline but they were not a serious cause for concern . 
the ons said output prices -- the price of goods leaving factory gates -- rose 0.2 percent in October , giving a year-on-year increase of 2.3 percent , compared with 2.2 percent in the 12-month period ending in September . 
input prices , a measure of the costs of raw materials and fuel , rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent in October but were down 2 percent from a year earlier . 
&quot; All of the rise in input prices was due to the recent rises in oil prices -- crude oil prices are 44 percent higher than a year ago , &quot; said Jonathan Loynes , UK economist at HSBC Markets . 
although other components either fell or were flat , Loynes said the rise in oil prices threatened to put further upward pressure on underlying inflation in the next few months , pushing it further away from the government &apos;s target of 2.5 percent . 
&quot; Oil apart , cost pressures in industry remain extremely subdued , suggesting that , while the next few inflation figures will be pushed up by higher petrol ( gasoline ) prices , the underlying picture continues to look favourable , &quot; he added . 
economists said Monday &apos;s figures were not strong enough to prompt the Bank of England to step up pressure for a further rise in official interest rates in the near future . 
Chancellor of the Exchequer ( finance minister ) Kenneth Clarke bowed to pressure from the Bank and raised rates unexpectedly Oct . 30 to 6 percent from 5.75 percent to head off a future pickup in inflation .
