European bunker prices were steady on Wednesday with demand good in Ara good , but poor in most other ports , dealers said . 
traders said a seller in Gothenburg had drawn buyers away from other NWE ports with offers lower than in Rotterdam , perhaps to cash in on profit gains to date . 
Rotterdam 380 CST was at $ 128 / $ 129 fob after barges backed off from morning gains . 
the steady prices launched about 25,000 to 30,000 tonnes of enquiries , although traders said some shipowners were likely to defer purchases until Thursday . 
&quot; The final demand should still be good even with deferrals , &quot; one dealer said . 
Hamburg prices pushed a little higher to $ 131 fob , opening a differential over Rotterdam that had collapsed late last week . 
Mediterranean prices were broadly steady . 
business in almost all ports was described as &apos; very quiet &apos; . 
the Fujairah bunker market was steady at $ 116 / $ 118 , leaving it still one of the world &apos;s cheapest ports . 
demand was thin and supply good . 
Durban fuel oil was steady at $ 130 / $ 132 ex wharf .
