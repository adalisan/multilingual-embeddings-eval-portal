the European Commission moved on Wednesday to ensure that European sports fans can continue to watch live major events on television without having to pay . 
the European Union executive proposed rules to allow national governments to guarantee viewers free access to coverage of events such as the Olympic Games , World Cup soccer finals and Tour de France bicycle race . 
pay TV operators that won exclusive rights to broadcast those events would have to ensure they were offered unscrambled or on a non-pay channel . 
EU Audiovisual Commissioner Marcelino Oreja said the proposal , which will now be debated by the European Parliament and EU governments , struck a balance between the public interest and the right of sports federations and pay-TV channels to earn money . 
the initiative reflects growing concern , especially in the parliament , that expensive bidding wars for television rights to major sports events by pay-TV operators will lead to charges for broadcasts of impoortant events . 
last July , for example , Germany &apos;s Kirch group won a bidding battle for TV rights to the 2002 and 2006 World Cup soccer finals . 
the Commission decided in favour of a &quot; mutual recognition &quot; system , rather than any kind of mandatory EU list of &quot; free &quot; events . 
&quot; The Commission is proposing that each member state should be free , within certain conditions , to determine which sporting events it deems to be of general interest , &quot; Oreja told a news conference . 
countries can draw up lists that are of &quot; major importance for society &quot; either EU-wide , nationally or even regionally -- for example , the Scottish FA Cup Final soccer match , the Commission said . 
Britain , France and Belgium already have such lists . 
Britain includes the Wimbledon Tennis Championships , for example , and France the Tour de France , while Belgium &apos;s Flemish community draws up a list every year . 
the proposal would not affect procedures for purchasing exclusive rights . 
Commission officials said broadcasters would still profit from advertising and sponsorship and would be able to sell the rights to television channels in the countries concerned .
