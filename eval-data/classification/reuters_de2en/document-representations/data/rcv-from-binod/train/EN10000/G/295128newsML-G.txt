Indonesia &apos;s official National Commission on Human Rights on Wednesday blamed an unnamed third party for inciting an ethnic and religious riot in West Java late last month in which four people died . 
Commission Chairman Munawir Sjadzali said in a written statement released early on Wednesday that the body &apos;s fact-finding team had found evidence in the town of Tasikmalaya of the involvement of a third party in the post-Christmas riot . 
&quot; Based upon the facts that were found , among others banners and leaflets which incited the people to protest , there is a strong suspicion there is a third party who set in motion this social disturbance , &quot; Sjadzali said in the statement . 
&quot; Because of this , the commission requests authorities as quickly as possible try this third party to prevent the occurrence of damage on this scale in other cities , &quot; the statement , co-signed by commission secretary-general Baharuddin Lopa , said . 
some Moslem leaders blamed the Tasikmalaya riot on so-called formless organisations , a government term for latent communist elements . 
but despite similar claims after a number of riots last year , no masterminds have so far been caught or prosecuted . 
the official Antara news agency on Tuesday quoted Armed Forces Chief Gen. Feisal Tanjung as saying the military knew the names of some of the &quot; intellectual actors &quot; in Tasikmalaya riot and a similar event in Situbondo , East Java , in October . 
&quot; We know there are intellectual actors behind the Tasikmalaya and Situbondo riots . 
we have recorded their identity , &quot; Tanjung was quoted as saying , adding they would be arrested and tried . 
a mob of mainly-Moslem youths set shops , buildings and some churches ablaze in Tasikmalaya , apparently incensed by a report of police brutality toward some Moslem religious teachers . 
in the Situbondo incident , a crowd of Moslems burned 25 churches and other buildings in a rampage sparked by the trial of a Moslem heretic who was subsequently jailed for blasphemy . 
five Christians died in one church fire . 
the rights commission also released a report on an ethnic riot last week in West Kalimantan on Borneo island , in which five people were killed . 
the riots erupted after a man from Madura island off Java reportedly stabbed two native Borneo Dayak tribesmen . 
more than 5,000 people of the Maduran ethnic group , who moved to Kalimantan in a government resettlement programme , temporarily fled the riot area , seeking safety in nearby military bases and major towns . 
&quot; The system and process of moving people must be perfected so that local residents are also able to raise their standard of living together with the people who are moved so that feelings of injustice do not appear in society and the nation , &quot; it said . 
while Indonesia &apos;s impressive economic performance has brought prosperity to the business community , analysts say the effects have yet to trickle down to the poor or to less-developed regions of the vast Indonesian archipelago . 
&quot; We still have the problem of gaps between sectors , between regions and between groups in society , &quot; President Suharto said in his annual budget speech on Monday .
