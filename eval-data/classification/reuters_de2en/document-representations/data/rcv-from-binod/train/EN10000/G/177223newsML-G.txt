a lovesick wild stag , playing havoc on a southern Irish golf course , evaded a security cordon on Friday round a hotel where a major EU conference is taking place . 
the potentially-dangerous stag has raised fears for 500 delegates attending talks on rural development hosted by current European Union president Ireland at the Cork city Silver springs Hotel . 
the stag moved onto the golf course a number of days ago and has chased off hotel staff who tried to get him to move on . 
&quot; At this time of year they are &quot; in rut &apos; so they are actually a bit violent because they hammer each other to get at the female and that is why it is behaving so aggressively , &quot; hotel manager Eoin Daly told Reuters . 
he said the hotel had no idea where the stag came from as the nearest herd of deer was more than 80 km ( 50 miles ) away . 
&quot; We have a massive EU conference here at the moment which started on Thursday and will go right through until Saturday morning but we are going to have to call in the ISPCA ( the Irish Society for the Protection of Cruelty to Animals ) to get rid of the stag so we can use the golf course , &quot; Daly said . 
during the rutting season , which can last for a few weeks , the usually timid male deer undergoes a character change and becomes aggressive , fighting other stags to win a female for mating . 
a Northern Ireland deer farmer was gored to death by a rutting stag several years ago .
