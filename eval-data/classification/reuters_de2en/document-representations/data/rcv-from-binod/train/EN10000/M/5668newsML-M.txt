yen broke down again late to day &apos;s lows and small losses when traders said a fund sold 800 Septembers after the contract had attempted to rise but stalled in choppy trade . 
pressure on yen stemmed partly from news overnight that a large Japanese consumer credit company had filed for bankruptcy , traders said . 
&quot; I definitely think that ( bankruptcy filing ) had some weight on it ( yen ) , &quot; said a floor trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange . 
marks advanced as traders reassessed the likelihood of an imminent a cut in German rates after a stronger-than-expected reading in the July &apos;s IFO Institute &apos;s business climate index . 
the index rose to 94.1 from 90.4 in June , above forecasts for about a 91.0 level . 
the IFO index redoubled attention on Thursday &apos;s council meeting after German M3 money supply data , released on Tuesday , showed slower growth and stoked talk of a cut in the 3.30-percent German securities repurchase rate . 
&quot; No change , &quot; said one floor broker of the expected outcome of Thursday &apos;s Bundesbank council meeting . 
he said if Germany leaves rates unchanged , he expected a knee-jerk rise in the mark . 
&quot; I think it &apos;ll ( dollar ) test below 1.48 and make a run for 1.4715 , &quot; he added . 
those levels equate to about $ 0.6767 and $ 0.6806 , respectively , in September mark futures . 
others looked for a German rate cut soon , albeit not necessarily on Thursday . 
&quot; I still think to keep some credibility and the EMU on track to some extent they have room to lower it ( repo rate ) at least five basis points , &quot; said a currency trader . 
&quot; I think it would be sending the wrong message if they didn &apos;t ( ease ) . 
&quot; I think they &apos;re ( Bundesbank ) going to cut , and that &apos;ll be it for a while , &quot; said another floor broker . 
the Swiss franc also shaved gains late after advancing on safe-haven purchases linked to anxiety about the status of Russian president Boris Yeltsin &apos;s health . 
the Interfax news agency reported on Wednesday that Yeltsin , the subject of rumors speculating he had heart surgery , would return to Moscow from holiday , but the Kremlin could not confirm that report . 
sterling edged up outright but slipped on crosses after the 0.6-percent month / month drop in July &apos;s U.K. retail sales . 
the drop fueled talk that U.K. chancellor Kenneth Clarke could press for a U.K. rate cut . 
September yen eased $ 0.000010 to $ 0.009251 , marks rose $ 0.0026 to $ 0.6754 , Swiss francs advanced $ 0.0033 to $ 0.8346 , Sterling gained $ 0.0022 to $ 1.5498 , Canadian dollar slipped $ 0.0003 to $ 0.7285 , Australian dollar rose $ 0.0042 to $ 0.7896 , and Mexican peso lost $ 0.000125 to $ 0.131750 .
