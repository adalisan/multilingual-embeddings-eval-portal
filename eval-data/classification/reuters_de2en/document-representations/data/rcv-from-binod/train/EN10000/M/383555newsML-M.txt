Indonesia &apos;s bond market is set to boom following a surge in the establishment of mutual funds despite the absence of a yield benchmark . 
market sources say a 1996 presidential decree granting tax exemption for interest income and capital gains from investments in bonds listed on stock exchanges is bearing fruit . 
agus Projosasmito , president director of PT Danareksa Sekuritas , told Reuters he was confident 1997 would be an impressive year for the fast developing bond market . 
&quot; I &apos;m very optimistic that the bond market will boom this year . 
there will be some 2.0 trillion rupiah ( $ 840.6 million ) of bonds to be issued this year through Danareksa alone , &quot; Projosasmito said . 
he said this was only the amount already confirmed . 
&quot; We are also in negotiations for some other deals which will further boost bond issues this year , &quot; Projosasmito said , adding he hoped this could help fill the demand for bonds by mutual funds . 
the same view was also shared by Ari Murhandoko , a director of PT Bahana Securities . 
&quot; There is no question the market is poised for rapid growth this year due to the tax rules , &quot; he said . 
Danareksa and Bahana , both controlled by the government , are among the top players in the bond market . 
although some market players were sceptical of a truly big bang in the Indonesian bond market , many remained optimistic despite the absence of a widely acceptable yield benchmark . 
&quot; There are not enough issuances to establish a proper yield curve in Indonesia , so that is probably the biggest problem , &quot; David Tan , product manager of JP Morgan , told Reuters . 
but Murhandoko said the boom would be mainly demand-driven . 
&quot; There will be a take-off in demand . 
but it won &apos;t be like a developed market because the rush in bonds will be driven by mutual funds seeking high yielding papers , &quot; he said . 
there is no official benchmark in Indonesia because the government is not allowed to issue bills to finance its budget , which is balanced by law . 
the government did issue Yankee bonds last year , but this was aimed mainly at reducing funding costs for Indonesian companies seeking funds offshore , especially in the U.S. market . 
Central bank governor Sudradjad Djiwandono said recently that the lack of liquidity and a benchmark and the absence of a central clearing and custodial body were among the problems hampering the progress of a bond market in Indonesia . 
however , Djiwandono said the government might select one bond issue to play the benchmark role . 
at present , some bond dealers were looking at the five-year one trillion rupiah of the state electricity firm Perusahaan Listrik Negara V / A bonds as the &quot; emergency &quot; benchmark , which was trading at 105.25 percent and yielding 15.37 percent . 
&quot; Mutual funds will mushroom . 
you can see a lot of firms are setting up investment funds now , &quot; Murhandoko said , adding that in the long run this would threaten traditional banking businesses . 
a mutual fund is often an open-end management company which pools funds from investors to establish a diversified portfolio of investments . 
investors buy the shares at net asset value and can redeem them at any time at the prevailing market price . 
Pardi Kendy , treasury head of PT Bank Buana Indonesia , said many fresh mutual funds had been set up recently and the most successful were those focusing on investments in bonds . 
&quot; Local interest rates are on a declining trend . 
we have to look for higher yielding long-term papers , and bonds offer the best alternative , &quot; Kendy said . 
&quot; We can fund the purchase through the money market . 
the indisputable attraction is the tax exemption , &quot; he said . 
the Capital Market Supervisory Agency ( Bapepam ) said net assets value of 24 mutual funds , and one close-end fund , totalled 2.9 trillion rupiah by January . 
&quot; We will have almost three trillion rupiah in six months time . 
we are in the process of granting another seven mutual funds in the near future , &quot; said a Bapepam official . 
&quot; The potential is enormous . 
we are still small compared to other countries . 
the establishment of open-end mutual funds was possible only after the enactment of new measures by Bapepam in May last year
