German shares were higher in early IBIS computer dealings on Tuesday as the firmer dollar helped the market rebound from Monday &apos;s losses . 
&quot; There &apos;s a good potential for the market to keep up this recovery , &quot; said one Frankfurt trader , noting that the dollar was trading above 1.74 marks in European dealings . 
others said the losses on Monday , tied to the drop on Wall Street , did not signal a change in the market &apos;s upward trend . 
they said the DAX would seek to reach 3,800 points this week and stabilise above the psychologically-important level that was broken last week when the DAX reached a new high in IBIS computer trading at 3,836.91 points . 
but any further advances would be dependent on trading volumes , which were weak on Monday as the second quarter ended . 
chemical and carmaker shares , which benefit from the weak mark helping exports , were leading the advance . 
Hoechst gained 2.47 marks to 76.37 marks , while Bayer was up one mark at 68.50 marks and BASF was up 1.10 marks at 64.60 marks . 
strong gains , rising 100 marks to 1,450 marks , or a rise of about four percent . 
market attention during bourse dealings will also focus on trading in software group Betasystems , the share price of which more than doubled on Monday from its initial public offering price of 100 marks to end the session at 206 marks .
