President Bill Clinton closes in on the Democratic Convention on Wednesday with a proposal to spend nearly $ 2 billion to speed Superfund toxic waste cleanup and persuade U.S. business to reclaim blighted urban industrial sites . 
aides said Clinton would promote the environmental plan , an element of his &quot; America Forward &quot; re-election agenda , as he wound a triumphal train trip to Chicago to be nominated on Wednesday night for a second term . 
Clinton , pumped up by the cheers of more than 20,000 supporters at a Lansing rally on Tuesday , proposed last March that $ 2 billion in tax incentives be given to spur private development of urban &quot; brownfields &quot; -- abandoned , lightly polluted factories and plants . 
most are found in decaying , drug and crime-ridden U.S. inner cities riddled with joblessless and despair . 
rolling through the Midwest on his 13-car campaign special , Clinton also lofted anti-crime and education initiatives . 
but Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole said his surging rival would arrive in Chicago &quot; on a train called the Status Quo Express . 
&quot; They &apos;re off track , and they &apos;ve been off track right along , &quot; Dole told reporters in San Diego , where he was preparing for the fall campaign . 
aides said Clinton &apos;s proposal on Wednesday would expand on his earlier brownfields plan by adding another $ 300 million in loans and grants to encourage urban reclamation projects . 
Clinton was also expected to call for a $ 1.3 billion Superfund boost over the next four years , which would allow cleanup of two-thirds of the country &apos;s toxic dumps by the year 2000 ; for $ 196 million to provide more environmental health data to the public ; and for $ 76 million to clean up the Great Lakes watershed . 
his environmental proposal would theoretically create jobs -- White House officials say the brownfields initiative alone would trigger $ 10 billion in private spending . 
but the 50-year-old Democrat was saving a targeted jobs initiative -- a plan to offer $ 3.4 billion in tax credits to companies to hire welfare recipients -- when he addresses the convention on Thursday night . 
Clinton &apos;s goal in the speech &quot; is to show his vision for the country and for what he wants America to be in the year 2000 , &quot; said White House Communications Director Don Baer . 
Baer said the speech would include &quot; very concrete proposals &quot; but no surprizes . 
&quot; There will be no gymnastics in his ( Clinton &apos;s speech ) , &quot; the presidential aide told reporters . 
Clinton , who began his 559-mile ( 885-km ) train trip in West Virginia on Sunday , angered many fellow Democrats last week by signing a Republican-backed welfare reform bill that effectively ends a 60-year-old federal guarantee of aid to the poor . 
at rally after rally on his whistlestop trip , Clinton said that making the politically popular welfare bill succeed was &quot; our next challenge . 
&quot; If you &apos;re going to tell somebody they have to go to work because they &apos;re able-bodied , they have to have work to find . 
they have to have a job to go to , and we have got to do that , &quot; he said .
