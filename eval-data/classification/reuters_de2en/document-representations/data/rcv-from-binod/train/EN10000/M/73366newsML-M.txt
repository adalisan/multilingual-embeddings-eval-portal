LME copper broke above the key $ 1,900 level as cash metal buying developed on Tuesday after inventories fell by more than had been expected . 
most of the other base metals ticked higher in sympathy and nickel backed away from a test of Monday &apos;s lows . 
three months copper finished the morning kerb at $ 1,905 per tonne , up $ 22 from Monday , after stocks fell by 8,825 tonnes , nearly 6,000 tonnes more than expected . 
many analysts had been expecting copper to remain under pressure after slipping under $ 1,900 in late trading on Friday and losing ground on Monday . 
&quot; We saw some good cash buying on the kerb and then some stops were hit , &quot; a floor trader said . 
in the first ring , nickel headed down towards Monday &apos;s nadir of $ 7,200 after stocks rose 462 tonnes , scoring a low of $ 7,220 . 
but it rebounded , ending the morning at $ 7,290 , down $ 30 from the previous afternoon kerb close . 
the market has been largely ignoring a week-long dispute at the Manitoba facility of INCO , which analysts say has good reserves . 
&quot; Estimates vary , but it is felt that a dispute of up to one month could be managed , but obviously the longer output is down , the better the stock situation will be with respect to prices , &quot; said broker GNI . 
aluminium held close to Monday &apos;s levels , with last kerb business at $ 1,395 , up $ 3 . 
the break below $ 1,400 has damaged the chart picture , but the market was oversold and support was being seen , dealers said . 
&quot; I &apos;ve seen some good consumer buying , but that doesn &apos;t mean it won &apos;t go lower , &quot; a floor trader said . 
tin stabilised after Monday &apos;s drop to six-month lows , finishing the morning at $ 6,060 per tonne , up $ 30 . 
Chartist Elli Gifford of Investment Research of Cambridge said tin risked forming a major top . 
&quot; Critical support is at $ 5,950 and were it to be breached , falls should extend to $ 5,400 at least , &quot; she said . 
&quot; Against any mildly oversold background such a breakdown may be averted near term , but the longer term picture has deteriorated enough to suggest that this risk may not be avoided for long , &quot; Gifford added . 
lead also moved sideways , reluctant to return to Monday &apos;s low of $ 764 , finishing the morning at $ 778 , up $ 3 . 
Monday &apos;s nadir should provide support , while resistance was pegged at $ 780 . 
zinc also edged higher , with last morning business at $ 1,022 , up $ 3 , 
Alloy was untraded on the kerb , but last ring business was at $ 1,228 , up $ 3 .
