Asian crude prices were steady on Tuesday , but Minas market levels were difficult to pinpoint with deals heard done at varying premiums , traders said . 
but traders said the direction of the market was vague as they were uncertain of as to which of the two deals were done first . 
rumours of a July Duri sale from an equity producer to a fuel oil blender at ICP + 80 cents was denied by the alleged seller , although traders agreed that the level is easily achievable . 
activities on West African crude was subdued as the Brent / Dubai spread widens . 
traders also expected the narrower premium of Tapis over Brent to cause refiners to cover their incremental demand with light regional crudes instead of West African . 
they said the spread between August Brent and Tapis is currently around $ 1.37 , compared to $ 1.87 a week ago . 
but this bullish sentiment had not filtered into the prices of light Asian crudes , traders said . 
they said July light Belida crude was rumoured sold at a low premium of ICP + 13 cents by an equity producer to a US major . 
August trading on the Middle East market was centred around Masila and Dubai , as buying interest for Oman and the other Middle East crudes was lacklustre . 
a shosha sold August Dubai yesterday at July whole month quotes at minus four cents to a major . 
the same seller also sold an August Masila to a western trader at OSP + 13 / 14 cents . 
the buyer , who is normally a Masila crude seller , had already bought several cargoes of August
