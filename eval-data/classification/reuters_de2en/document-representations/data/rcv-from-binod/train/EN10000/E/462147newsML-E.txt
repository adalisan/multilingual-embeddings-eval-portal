Malaysia &apos;s central Bank Negara &apos;s annual report for 1996 is expected to keep the economy on a tight leash and to focus on policies to manage the bank &apos;s successes , economists said . 
they said the central bank was widely accepted as a significant contributor last year to allaying international fears of overheating in Malaysia by helping to bring down economic growth and the current account deficit . 
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim &apos;s Anwar announced last month that Malaysia &apos;s economy grew by 8.2 percent in 1996 against 9.5 percent in 1995 , and its current account deficit dropped to 11 billion ringgit ( $ 4.4 billion ) from 18 billion ringgit previously . 
the annual report , usually the first official document to announce economic data for the past year and provide revised forecasts for the current year , is due out on March 28 . 
&quot; By and large they ( Bank Negara ) should be happy with their performance . 
from here on they have to manage their success , &quot; said Liew Yin Sze , economist with J.M. 
Sassoon in Singapore . 
he said the key in the report would be the central bank &apos;s view of the economy . 
&quot; We want to see if they are still concerned by consumption growth and loans growth , &quot; he said . 
he said loans growth and spending by consumers were still problems facing the economy , and Bank Negara was expected to tackle them by leaving unchanged its high interest rate regime . 
&quot; I expect them ( Bank Negara ) to reaffirm their stance on monetary policy ... reaffirm their desire to bring down monetary growth ( and ) ... continue their fight to bring down current account deficit , &quot; said Danial Lian , economist with NatWest Markets in Singapore . 
Malaysia &apos;s growing current account deficit and inflation had triggered worries about overheating and forced it to maintain a tight monetary policy since late 1995 . 
the three-month interbank rate has risen nearly 200 basis points in the last two years . 
&quot; I would also like to see if they are endorsing the strong ringgit policy . 
but I don &apos;t think they will mention the ringgit , they don &apos;t usually , &quot; Lian said . 
improving economic fundamentals have sharply boosted the ringgit this year . 
it has risen 1.9 percent against the dollar and 5.1 percent to a 30-month high against the Singapore dollar . 
Patrick ER , economist with CIMB Securities in Kuala Lumpur , said the central bank endorsed a strong ringgit , though they would not say it openly . 
&quot; If you see , they have not intervened in the market even once since the ringgit started rising . 
he said another figure to be watched for in the annual report was that for long-term capital inflows . 
&quot; I want to know how the current account gap is being funded , &quot; he said . 
most economists agreed that in terms of broad economic numbers , the report would not contain any surprises . 
economic growth for 1997 was expected to be around the government &apos;s previous forecast of 8.0 percent . 
however , Yin Sze of J.M. 
Sassoon said the report could announce a rise in the current account deficit . 
he said economic growth last year had slowed partly due to a drop in exports . 
with a recovery expected , imports would rise sharply , particularly for the Commonwealth Games that Malaysia is hosting next year .
