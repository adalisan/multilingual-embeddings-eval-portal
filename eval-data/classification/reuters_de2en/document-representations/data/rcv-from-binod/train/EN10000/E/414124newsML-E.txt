&quot; On February 28 , the IMF approved the release of SDR 10 million to Zambia following the completion of the mid-term review of the first annual arrangement under ESAF , &quot; Elwaleed Taha told Reuters on Monday . 
&quot; Negotiations between the government and the IMF for the second phase will start soon , probably in April , &quot; Taha said . 
ESAF is a concessionary IMF facility aimed at assisting eligible members undertaking economic reforms to strenghten their balance of payments and improve their growth prospects . 
ESAF loans carry an interest rate of 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a five-and-a-half year grace period . 
the country was declared ineligible to use IMF financial resources in September 1987 following the accumulation of overdue financial obligations to the IMF . 
the southern African country faces severe financial problems following aid cuts effected last year by western governments opposed to the manner in which controversial general elections were held . 
Analaysts estimate that , of the $ 130 million promised to Zambia by the Consultative Group in 1996 , only some $ 25 million actually materialised . 
several western governments have said they will retain the aid cuts this year .
