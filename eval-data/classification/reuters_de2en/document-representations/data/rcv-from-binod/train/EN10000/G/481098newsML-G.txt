a Lagos high court judge said on Wednesday he could not hear an application for bail by eight Nigerian dissidents charged with treason because of the absence in court of a lawyer for the military government . 
the eight have been detained since December and were charged last month with treason over a series of bomb blasts in Lagos which killed three soldiers and wounded dozens . 
Self-exiled Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka and two other leaders of the exiled wing of NADECO ( National Democratic Coalition ) opposition group are charged with the same offence . 
justice James Oduneye said he could not hear the bail application as there was no government legal representation . 
&quot; The accused have been charged with waging war against government . 
this is a serious offence and so the prosecution needed to be in court to argue against the request for bail , &quot; Oduneye said . 
he scheduled the next hearing for Monday . 
lawyers said the government was not represented because it was not clear if the Lagos state government or the federal authorities based in Abuja were responsible for opposing bail . 
none of the dissidents were in court . 
radical lawyer and human rights activist Gani Fawehinmi , representing them , said the absence of a government lawyer was &quot; executive and anarchical lawlessness . 
&quot; A court order that one of my clients Frederick Fasehun be released was never obeyed , &quot; said Fawehinmi , a staunch critic of the military authorities . 
twice this year , a Lagos high court ordered the authorities to free medical doctor Fasehun , chairman of the Campaign for Democracy ( CD ) pressure group . 
but security authorities said he was being held for the bombings , which Nigerian police have blamed on NADECO of which CD is a member .
