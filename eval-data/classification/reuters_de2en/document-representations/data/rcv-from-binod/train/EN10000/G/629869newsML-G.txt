three former Boston players came back to haunt the Red SOx on Sunday as the trio helped the New York Yankees prevail 11-6 in 15 innings at Fenway Park . 
mark whiten walloped a tie-breaking Homer and Wade Boggs added a three-run blast against their old club in a six-run 15th and Mike Stanton turned in some strong relief against his former teammates in New York &apos;s marathon victory . 
the Yanks scored three runs in the top of the ninth to erase a 4-2 deficit and grab a 5-4 lead . 
Boston bounced right back with a run in the last of the ninth to bring extra innings . 
five scoreless innings followed before New York &apos;s six-run outburst . 
&quot; There &apos;s always satisfaction to beat up on your old team , &quot; said whiten , who hit a lowly .185 with one Homer in 108 at-bats with Boston in 1995 . 
&quot; The way I played here , then to come back and do something positive , is great . 
Boggs played 11 seasons in Boston before signing with the Yankees as a free agent in 1993 . 
Stanton , who hurled 3-2 / 3 innings of scoreless relief , pitched 81 games for Boston in 1995 and 1996 . 
whiten hit a solo shot into the right-field bullpen off Kerry Lacy and Boggs broke an 0-for-15 slump with a three-run blast down the right-field line off Rich Garces . 
Boggs , the former Boston Red SOx who batted lower than third ( sixth ) Saturday and Sunday for the first time since his rookie year in 1983 , was booed each trip to the plate . 
&quot; It &apos;s not easy ( getting booed ) , especially being in Boston , &quot; Boggs said . 
&quot; Everybody becomes a little louder . 
Jeff Nelson ( 2-4 ) picked up the win . 
in Milwaukee , Jose Valentin &apos;s two-run Homer in the sixth inning gave the Milwaukee Brewers the lead for good as they went on to a 7-4 victory over the Chicago White SOx . 
Jeff Cirillo also hit a two-run Homer for Milwaukee , which has won the first three games of the series . 
winning starter Jose Mercedes ( 2-1 ) took the win as Milwaukee climbed back over the .500 mark ( 26-25 ) . 
Albert belle extended his current league-high hitting streak to 27 games when he led off the second with a Homer . 
he tied the team record , established by Luke Appling in 1936 . 
frank Thomas homered twice for Chicago . 
at Texas , Joe Vitiello and Jeff King each homered and drove in two runs as the Kansas City Royals defeated the Texas Rangers 6-2 . 
Vitiello hit a two-run Homer in the first and King added a solo shot in the fifth . 
Jose Rosado ( 4-3 ) retired the first 14 batters he faced . 
Randy Veres went the last 3 1 / 3 innings for his first save . 
in Anaheim , Terry Steinbach continued his torrid hitting with a pair of homers , including a go-ahead solo shot in the fifth inning , as the Minnesota twins beat the angels 5-4 . 
Steinbach , who is 17-for-39 with eight RBI in his last 10 games , cracked a two-run blast off Anaheim rookie starter Matt Perisho in the top of the third before breaking a 4-4 tie against Shigetoshi Hasegawa ( 1-3 ) in the fifth . 
Greg Swindell ( 3-2 ) got the win with 2 2 / 3 innings of shutout relief . 
Rick Aguilera struck out two in the ninth for his 12th save . 
he has two wins and six saves in his last eight appearances . 
in Oakland , Matt stairs hit a three-run Homer in the second inning and Mike Oquist came within one out of his first career complete game as the Oakland Athletics routed the Toronto Blue Jays 8-2 . 
Oquist ( 1-1 ) allowed two runs and 10 hits , walking two and striking out five in the longest outing of his career . 
&quot; He ( Oquist ) pitched great today , &quot; Toronto manager Cito Gaston said . 
&quot; He did an outstanding job against us , you have to give him credit . 
in Seattle , Dan Wilson hit the game-tying home run in the seventh inning and Mike blowers and Alex Rodriguez added solo shots in the eighth as the mariners snapped a three-game losing streak with a 4-1 victory over the Detroit Tigers . 
Seattle starter Derek Lowe , who was celebrating his 24th birthday , and three relievers combined on a four-hitter for Seattle . 
Scott Sanders ( 2-5 ) won in relief . 
the way the kids are pitching . 
Detroit &apos;s Justin Thompson ( 5-4 ) pitched 7 1 / 3 innings and yielded two runs and six hits . 
he walked none and tied a season-high with nine strikeouts . 
in Baltimore , the Orioles &apos; game against the Cleveland Indians was rained out after one inning .
