South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said on Monday that a comprehensive solution was needed to end the crisis in Central Africa and that Pretoria was willing to play a significant diplomatic role as an &quot; honest broker &quot; . 
Mbeki also told a news conference in Rome that , in principle , South Africa would be willing to take part in a military force for the region if its refugee-aid mandate was well defined by the United Nations . 
&quot; Clearly one of the first things that needs to be done is reaching the refugees in east Zaire , &quot; said Mbeki , who is holding talks with Italian officials on trade and will attend the U.N. World Food Summit in the city this week . 
&quot; The refugee matter -- urgent as it is -- in the end one needs a comprehensive resolution of all the tensions that exist in this part of Central Africa and East Africa and that &apos;s going to take a bit of time , &quot; he said . 
in Zaire , foreign aid workers took some aid into the eastern city of Goma on Monday , but more than a million refugees remained beyond reach and were reported dying in their thousands . 
Mbeki said South Africa had been in touch with the governments of Rwanda and Zaire . 
&quot; We don &apos;t aim to lead in this process but we have good contacts with all of the players in the region and they treat South Africa as an honest broker because we don &apos;t have any special national interests in this region , &quot; he said . 
&quot; In the event of the deployment of military troops of one kind or another , they must not be attacked by anybody . 
we are involved in that process to try to assist , to get that kind of agreement , &quot; he added . 
the repatriation of refugees to Rwanda and Burundi had to be linked to a search for stable political settlements in both countries . 
&quot; You need a comprehensive settlement that would impact not just on Burundi and Rwanda but would have to include Zaire , Uganda and Tanzania and some other countries in East Africa , &quot; Mbeki said . 
he said South Africa was willing to consider supplying communications and military hospitals in any eventual international force . 
&quot; In principle we would be ready to participate in such programmes as might be necessary to achieve ... a defined mandate , &quot; he said . 
Mbeki said it was important that both sides should firmly commit themselves to a ceasefire and to not hindering the movement of humanitarian assistance .
