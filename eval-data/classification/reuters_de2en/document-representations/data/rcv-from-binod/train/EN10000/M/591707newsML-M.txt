Swiss-owned Nestle Australia Ltd declined to comment on Friday on any plans by the company to raise domestic retail prices after a surge in international prices to around 20-year highs . 
Nestle last raised its Australian instant coffee prices 10 percent in April , which restored the product to the same levels it had been a year previously before the firm lowered prices by the same amount , spokesman Peter Kelly told Reuters . 
Kelly said April &apos;s increase represented only a fraction of the 100 percent rise in the price of coffee beans over the same period . 
Nestle holds 70 percent of Australia &apos;s instant coffee market and has 54 percent of the country &apos;s total coffee market by volume . 
world coffee prices soared to 20-year highs on the New York futures market on Thursday on frantic buying from speculators and commercial coffee firms worried about small coffee stockpiles and shrinking crop prospects . 
some managers of coffee bars on Sydney &apos;s streets said they expected surging world prices to be passed through to their customers in coming weeks . 
&quot; We haven &apos;t raised our prices yet , but we &apos;ve been told by our supplier that its coming in a month or two , &quot; John Louicv , manager of the Euro cafe in Sydney &apos;s business district . 
Louicv said a cup of capuccino currently retails for about A $ 2.50 in Sydney &apos;s trendiest cafes , although that could change with higher wholesale prices on the cards . 
&quot; It &apos;s inevitable , &quot; said another cafe manager . 
&quot; If prices go up around the world , its got to hit us at some point . 
Richard Palm of Angco Ltd , which imports coffee into Australia from Papua New Guinea , said he has seen his costs more than double recently .
