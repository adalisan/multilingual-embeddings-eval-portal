Hong Kong gold bounced back from a three-year low on Monday but still ended below New York &apos;s Friday close on overseas selling , dealers said . 
Bullion ended at US $ 360.50 / 361.00 on Monday against New York &apos;s $ 360.75 / 361.25 close on Friday . 
gold sank to a three-year low of $ 360.30 in the afternoon session before rebounding . 
traders reported healthy sales from overseas markets in the afternoon , which put pressure on prices . 
&quot; Everyone is very , very short , &quot; said one bullion trader , noting that the downward trend could continue only for a short time before players started short-covering . 
dealers saw strong support at $ 360 per ounce . 
many physical buyers were holding back , some bullion dealers said , but one large supplier of physical gold in the territory said the firm had seen strong demand on Monday . 
&quot; But it &apos;s not enough against the tidal wave of people who want to push gold lower , &quot; said a dealer at the firm . 
Japanese traders bought gold in morning trade , dealers said , adding that the amounts were less than expected , which had led to long liquidation . 
Tael gold was at a strong premium over spot gold prices , with the U.S. dollar equivalent at $ 361.40 / 90 per ounce . 
traders said stocks in Hong Kong were low , partly on steady demand for kilobars and partly because tael gold prices followed spot gold down after a time lag . 
the carryover charge at the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society was unchanged from its previous fix on Saturday at -4.00 .
