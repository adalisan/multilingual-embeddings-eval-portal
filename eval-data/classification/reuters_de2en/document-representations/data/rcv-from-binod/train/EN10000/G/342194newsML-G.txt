Finland may have to review before general elections in 1999 its stance of not seeking membership of NATO , Defence Minister Anneli Taina said on Wednesday . 
although Finland was not seeking membership now it had not &quot; closed the door &quot; on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation , Taina told the daily Helsingin Sanomat in an interview . 
&quot; The ( NATO ) enlargement process is moving rapidly , bringing new swings , so it is altogether possible that the lines of policy will have to be reassessed in Finland too , &quot; she said . 
Taina was responding to a question whether membership of the Western alliance would come onto the agenda of Finland &apos;s coalition government , whose term runs to early 1999 . 
Finland , which shares a long border with Russia , was neutral during the Cold War but since joining the European Union in 1995 it has preferred to say it is militarily independent . 
its leaders see EU membership as a cornerstone for security and President Martti Ahtisaari has repeatedly said Finland has no need of NATO membership under current circumstances . 
&quot; It is justifiable to assume tighter cooperation through NATO enlargement and its expanded Partnership for Peace will lead to a situation where the whole of Europe &apos;s military security will lean on NATO , &quot; Taina said . 
intensification of NATO &apos;s Partnership for Peace programme could lead to a partnership council of members and partners which Finland should aim to join , she said .
