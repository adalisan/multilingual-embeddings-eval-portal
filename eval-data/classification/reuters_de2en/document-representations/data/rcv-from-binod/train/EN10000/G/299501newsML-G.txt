the European Parliament -- in limbo until its presidential elections are held on Tuesday -- will not take any decision next week on whether to throw out bankrupt French businessman Bernard Tapie , officials said Friday . 
parliamentary officials were reacting to a decision by France &apos;s top administrative court on Wednesday to reject an appeal by embattled Tapie to retain his seat in parliament , his last political job . 
the Council of State turned down Tapie &apos;s request to suspend a French government decree removing him from the Europarliament after a court declared him ineligible for public office on bankruptcy charges . 
for the parliament to act , its president must be formally notified of the French decision and that will be impracticable before Tuesday &apos;s election in Strasbourg of the new president , officials explained . 
the parliament committee which would have to prepare the decision will not be able to meet until its new chairman is elected on Thursday next week , the official said . 
the parliament &apos;s president , vice presidents and other officers are changed half way through the assembly &apos;s five year term . 
the official said that a decision would be taken when the parliament meets for in Brussels on January 29-30 for a mini-session or at the latest when it meets in Strasbourg in February . 
the Council of State ruled that a conviction for bankruptcy carried ineligibility , and national authorities were entitled to end the European mandate of ineligible representatives . 
the ruling , released to the press , appeared to spell the end of the political road for Tapie , a flamboyant ex-cabinet minister who has already been stripped of his seat in the French National Assembly . 
the parliament had deferred a decision to strip him of his seat after his lawyers argued that Prime Minister Alain Juppe &apos;s decree , issued last November , was unprecedented in the history of the assembly and created a situation not provided for in its rules . 
Tapie , the target of a blizzard of legal actions over his now destroyed business empire and the Marseille soccer team he once ran , has been sentenced to jail terms of eight and six months for tax fraud and rigging a soccer match . 
he is appealing in both cases to the French supreme court and has promised to resign from the European Parliament if the court confirms his sentence for match-rigging at the Olympique Marseille . 
the ruling is expected on February 4 .
