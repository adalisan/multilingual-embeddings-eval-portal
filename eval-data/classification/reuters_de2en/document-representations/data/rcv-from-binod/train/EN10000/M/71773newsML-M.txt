Saudi Arabia is working on international offers to sell the country barley and appears to be closing towards a final purchase of some 1.4 million tonnes , grain traders said on Monday . 
details of the purchase , following a tender , have not been confirmed but may become known later on Monday , they said . 
Saudi Arabia , the largest world barley importer , last week stunned grain markets with a tender to buy 1.72 million tonnes between October and December . 
up to one million tonnes of the grain is expected to come from the European Union , split between EU intervention stores and the open market . 
traders on the sidelines of an international grains conference said that offers to the Saudi tender were anywhere between some $ 146 and $ 164 a tonne with freight . 
highest ones were for nearby delivery . 
average sale prices could be in the high $ 150s , they said . 
fob barley firmed by several dollars from as low as $ 130 last week on news of the Saudi tender .
