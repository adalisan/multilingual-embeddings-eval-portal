Seattle SuperSonics guard Hersey Hawkins scored the NBA &apos;s 7,000,000th point in the league &apos;s marquee game Sunday , but three teams in action elsewhere had a lot of trouble putting the ball in the hoop . 
the NBA runner-up Sonics went down to defeat when Karl Malone scored 30 points and grabbed 13 rebounds as the Utah Jazz scored a 96-90 road victory in a rematch of last year &apos;s Western Conference finals . 
John Stockton added 12 assists but only six points for Utah ( 12-2 ) , which won its 10th straight . 
Utah &apos;s only two losses came in a home-and-home series against the Houston rockets , who lead them by two games in the Midwest Division . 
&quot; This is one game . 
we &apos;ve had some big games with Chicago , Dallas , Denver and the Sonics , &quot; said Utah coach Jerry Sloan . 
&quot; These are the kinds of teams we judge ourselves against . 
we played hard and took advantage of some key situations , but it &apos;s just another win . 
&quot; As far as I &apos;m concerned , it &apos;s just one game in a season and we came out and executed and did everything we needed to do , &quot; said Malone . 
&quot; We never let the crowd into it . 
every time they did something , we answered and kept them out of it . 
Malone has led the team in scoring in all but two games and in rebounding in all but five . 
Shawn Kemp had 29 points and 12 rebounds and Gary Payton added 19 points for the Pacific Division-leading Sonics ( 14-4 ) , who had won 13 of their previous 14 games . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think we played with an urgency or an energy that was respectful of the matchup , &quot; said Seattle coach George Karl . 
Seattle got to within six points on Kemp &apos;s 20-footer late in the fourth quarter , but Shandon Anderson and Malone had two free throws apiece to put the lead back to 95-85 as Utah held on for the victory . 
&quot; Obviously we &apos;re not as good as we think we are , &quot; said Seattle forward Detlef Schrempf . 
&quot; We have beaten a lot of teams , but teams we were supposed to beat . 
it took us a long time to get any energy in the game and when we did , we fought back into the game but they made the good plays and we didn &apos;t . 
Hawkins scored the NBA &apos;s 7 millionth point on a jumper at 7 : 58 of the fourth quarter , the league said . 
Seattle &apos;s only other loss to a Western Conference team this season came against the Jazz in a 99-91 decision on opening night . 
in Detroit , Grant Hill scored nine of his 23 points during a 21-2 run in the first quarter and Grant Long added 15 points as the pistons whipped the Sacramento Kings 95-66 . 
Detroit , whose largest lead was 35 , bounced back from its second home loss of the season and won for the seventh time in nine games . 
the 66 points was the second-lowest output in Kings history , by seven points . 
Sacramento fell to 1-4 on its six-game road trip and has lost three straight by an average of 20 points per game . 
the pistons made just over 50 percent of their shots ( 34-for-67 ) , while the Kings shot 28 percent ( 24-for-85 ) . 
&quot; It was a horrible performance , &quot; said Kings coach Garry St. Jean . 
&quot; It started early and stayed consistent . 
say whatever you want , we got spanked , kicked , pushed and shoved . 
it was a long night sitting there on the bench and I am sure it was the same for the players out on the floor . 
at Los Angeles , Shaquille O &apos;Neal had 24 points and 16 rebounds and tied a career-high with eight assists as the Lakers held the Denver nuggets to a franchise-low nine points in the first quarter before holding on for a 104-96 victory . 
Nick Van Exel added 24 points for the Lakers , who closed the first quarter on a 10-1 run for a 23-9 lead . 
Derek Fisher &apos;s three-pointer capped a 20-1 run bridging the first and second quarters as the Lakers took a commanding 33-9 advantage with 6 : 38 to go in the first half . 
Antonio McDyess scored 15 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter to help the nuggets get within 99-90 with 62 seconds remaining . 
but Van Exel sealed the victory with four free throws in the final 33 seconds . 
Dale Ellis scored 20 points for Denver , which dropped to 1-3 under new coach Dick Motta . 
the nuggets have lost seven of their last eight games . 
at Golden State , Latrell Sprewell scored 28 points and B.J. 
Armstrong added seven of his 18 in a second-quarter run as the Warriors pounded the Portland Trail Blazers 98-70 . 
Chris Mullin added 11 for Golden State , which salvaged the back end of a home-and-home series against Portland . 
the Warriors set a franchise record for fewest points and field goals ( 24 ) allowed . 
Portland shot only 30 percent ( 24-of-79 ) from the field . 
it was the second time this season the Trail Blazers have been held to 70 points , two higher than their franchise record for fewest points in a game .
