the Australian 10-year bond futures contract continued to edge away from the 1994 peak of 93.630 in SYCOM trade , touching another all-time high of 93.680 , and will look to press higher after Friday &apos;s likely consolidation . 
the contract ended after hours trade at 93.660 , up from Thursday &apos;s 93.625 open outcry close and after bouncing from a session low of 93.575 . 
Peter Pontikis , technical strategist at Westpac , said the contract is mirroring the positive trend of U.S. debt and to a lesser extent the short end of the local curve , and expects a move into the 93.700s after consolidating a 93.580 / 93.666 range . 
the contract had touched a peak of 93.675 on Thursday after weaker than expected monthly and quarterly retail trade data , although the market now falls into a data void with the next major release not due until next Thursday &apos;s labour force report . 
U.S. treasuries ended firm for the fourth straight day , recovering from a volatile opening amid a barrage of data and faces the key non-farm payrolls report later on Friday . 
second quarter U.S. GDP rose 2.2 percent , slightly above expectations , but the first quarter was revised down to 4.9 from 5.9 percent . 
other data saw weekly jobless claims fall , while the Chicago purchasing manager &apos;s survey declined .
