tanks on Tuesday paraded through an Islamist-controlled Ankara district that staged an anti-Israel protest last week in an apparent show of strength by the staunchly secularist army . 
the state-run Anatolian news agency said 20 tanks , 15 armoured personnel carriers , military jeeps and heavy lorries were taking part in a training march through the Sincan district . 
military officials denied the march was as response to the anti-Israeli rally . 
&quot; This has nothing to do with that . 
this is training that we do all the time . 
this is the normal route of the tanks . 
are they supposed to fly or something , &quot; a military official told Reuters . 
the interior ministry has launched an investigation into an Islamist mayor over the anti-Israel protest , organised under the name of &quot; Jerusalem night &quot; in Sincan district last Friday . 
a speech by Sincan &apos;s mayor , Bekir Yildiz , has been criticised in the media as a call for the implementation of the strict Islamic sharia law . 
Anatolian news agency quoted Interior Minister Meral Aksener as saying she would act as necessary against the mayor , who belongs to the senior coalition partner , Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan &apos;s Welfare Party . 
youths dressed as Palestinians pretended to throw stones at Israeli troops in a play at a public hall in Sincan to mark Jerusalem Day , declared an annual day of protest against Israel by late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini . 
the mayor and the Iranian ambassador spoke on a stage draped with the banners of Fathi Shaqiqi , the late leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group , and Imam Moussa Sadr , an influential cleric venerated by some Lebanese Shi &apos;ites . 
imam Sadr disappeared while on a trip to Libya in the late 1970 &apos;s . 
the foreign ministry summoned Iran &apos;s ambassador , Mohammad-Reza Baqeri , to protest against his role in Jerusalem day . 
Iran objected to Turkey &apos;s protest . 
a state security court also launched an inquiry on the event while main opposition motherland Party asked the government for an explanation for the conduct of the Iranian ambassador . 
Erbakan , Turkey &apos;s first Islamist prime minister , has gone back on promises to scrap a military training accord with Israel that has angered Arab countries and Iran . 
but Erbakan has raised the hackles of the secularist wing of his coalition government in recent weeks with plans to build mosques and other Islamist programmes .
