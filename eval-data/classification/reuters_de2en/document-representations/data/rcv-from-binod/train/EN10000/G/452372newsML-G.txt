Japanese scientists announced on Wednesday that by delving inside a cell membrane they had found the world &apos;s tiniest natural motor . 
they said the protein molecule F1-ATPase rotated with an incredible force , and they were able to videotape the motion . 
&quot; We now show that a single molecule of F1-ATPase acts as a Rotary motor , the smallest known , by direct observation of its motion , &quot; Masasuke Yoshida and colleagues at the Tokyo Institute of Technology wrote in a report in the science journal Nature . 
the central rotor is just one nanometre ( one-billionth of a metre ) across , turning in a &quot; barrel &quot; 10 nanometres across . 
other studies had indicated the protein might work as a rotor , but Yoshida &apos;s team proved it . 
they used a fluorescent filament , which they attached to the protein , to watch the motion . 
&quot; In the presence of ATP , the filament rotated for more than 100 revolutions in an anticlockwise direction , &quot; they wrote . 
ATP or adenosine triphosphate carries chemical energy and is basic to cell metabolism -- the chemical changes that provide energy for movement and growth . 
the rotor is one component of cell metabolism . 
Steven Block , a molecular biologist at Princeton University , called the experiment &quot; elegant &quot; and proved that the protein was indeed the world &apos;s smallest Rotary motor . 
before now , the smallest rotor was found in the flagellar motors of bacteria , which drive the little filaments that propel them along . 
these motors , many times the size of the one found by Yoshida , turn at speeds in excess of 1,000 hertz ( cycles ) . 
&quot; transposed into our own dimensions , if cars could drive at equivalent scale speeds , they would break the sound barrier , &quot; Block wrote in an accompanying commentary .
