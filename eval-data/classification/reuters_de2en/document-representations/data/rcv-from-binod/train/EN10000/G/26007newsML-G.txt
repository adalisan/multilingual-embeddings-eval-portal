an Iraqi opposition group in Jordan urged Iraqi troops on Saturday to rebel against President Saddam Hussein to thwart any attacks on Kurdish-held territory . 
&quot; The Iraqi National Accord ( INA ) warns of frightening movements and premeditated plans and preparations by ( Iraqi President ) Saddam Hussein to strike against the liberated areas of northern Iraq , &quot; the group said in a faxed statement . 
&quot; The INA calls on the Iraqi army and armed forces to rebel and thwart Saddam &apos;s plans , abort his rash adventure and stop his orders being carried out . 
he said the tanks were stationed between four to 10 km ( two to six miles ) from Arbil . 
London-based Iraqi exiles said earlier that Iraqi tanks had entered Arbil but the INA spokesman , who said he was in touch with members in Arbil and Mosul , could not confirm their reports . 
Arbil is inside the safe haven zone patrolled by U.S. , British and French planes since the end of the 1991 Gulf War . 
the Iraqi National Accord was the first Iraqi opposition group to set up a base in Jordan after King Hussein broke ties with Saddam last year and called for a change of leadership in Baghdad .
