Tokyo stocks faltered slightly in in early morning trade on Tuesday due to small-lot selling , with the market unable to recover from the heavy losses it accumulated on the previous day , brokers said . 
they added that the down-side should be limited as bargain hunting was expected .

in the futures market , the benchmark December futures were down 10 points at 20,670 . 
&quot; The market is basically in a wait-and-see mood and participants are few , and arbitrage-linked selling could become a burden , &quot; a &quot; Big Four &quot; brokerage broker said .
