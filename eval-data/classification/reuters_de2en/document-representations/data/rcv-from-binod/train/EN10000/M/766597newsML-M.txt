the dollar ended lower on Wednesday after climbing to a fresh 2-1 / 2-month high against the yen and faltering in an attempt to retest its high of 1.8490 marks set on Tuesday . 
dollar / yen briefly hit 118.95 -- its highest since 119.15 on May 14 -- on weaker-than-expected Japanese economic data . 
it also staged a brief assault on the Swiss franc to peak at a fresh 47-month high at 1.5261 Swiss francs . 
the U.S. currency soared overnight against the yen on news that Japan &apos;s industrial output dropped 3.1 percent and retail sales fell 2.3 percent in June . 
the reports were disappointing for investors who had been betting on a Japanese recovery and higher Japanese rates . 
dealers said the rally lacked conviction as market players were hesitant to push the dollar into a higher trading range above the key technical retracement level of 119.00 . 
&quot; There were big sellers waiting just above 118.50 yen , &quot; said Jeffrey Yu , senior dealer at Sanwa Bank Ltd in New York who added that concern about U.S.-Japanese trade relations frazzled some nerves at that lofty dollar / yen level . 
the dollar ended at 118.40 / 45 yen vs. 118.80 / 85 at the open . 
traders cited rumors that U.S. carmakers wanted Washington to review U.S.-Japan trade barriers . 
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky had suggested on Monday that Japan had fallen short of fulfilling a trade agreement . 
the dollar also tried to retest the 1.8490-mark level , the highest since November 1989 set on Monday , but that rally ran out of steam at 1.8454 marks . 
dollar / mark ended at 1.8360 / 70 vs. 1.8435 / 40 at the open . 
that same rally was accompanied by an attack on the Swiss francs that culminated at 1.5261 , the highest level since 1.5375 in August 1993 . 
both dollar / mark and dollar / Swiss rallies faltered on lack of follow-through that raised some limited concern of a near-term top formation . 
traders also noted that the dollar &apos;s long-standing bullish momentum was tempered by growing market concerns about the possibility of higher German interest rates to counter any inflation born via the weak mark . 
however , the U.S. unit &apos;s ability to hold firmly above support at 1.8250 -- the 38-percent retracement of the rally from 1.7860 on July 21 to the high of 1.8490 on Monday -- convinced participants to reset long dollar / mark positions . 
but David Horner , First Vice President at Merrill Lynch , played down the chances of a German rate hike this summer . 
&quot; talk of a Bundesbank rate rise is a paper-tiger threat with German unemployment at 11 percent , &quot; Horner said . 
&quot; In the short-term , the Bundesbank can take care of the mark that way , &quot; Horner said , referring to the German central bank &apos;s recent decision to fix repo rates for only two of its four-week summer recess . 
traders said this could be read as meaning Germany &apos;s 3.0-percent repo rates could become variable in mid-August and drift higher , lending support to the weakening mark . 
&quot; By holding German rates too high for too long , the Bundesbank put the German economy in such a precarious position that it ends up undermining the currency , &quot; Horner said , adding that both the German economy and the mark would be better off today if Germany had eased last year . 
the dollar closed at 1.5120 / 30 Swiss francs vs. 1.5240 / 50 at the open , in a range between a high of 1.5261 and a low of 1.5115 . 
cable ended at $ 1.6280 / 90 vs. $ 1.6240 / 50 while the Australian dollar finished at $ 0.7442 / 47 vs. $ 0.7451 / 55 .
