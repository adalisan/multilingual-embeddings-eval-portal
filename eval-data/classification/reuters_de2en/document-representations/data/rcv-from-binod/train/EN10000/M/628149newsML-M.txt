Asian coffee producers are scrambling to cash-in on the highest world coffee prices in two decades , but many may have missed the boat as global coffee stocks slump and prices on store shelves in the region climb . 
&quot; It &apos;s so volatile at the moment , everyone is just standing around with their mouths open , &quot; one major coffee roaster said on Friday . 
new York arabica coffee futures set new 20-year peaks overnight on Thursday in the third straight day of a sizzling rally that saw prices shatter the $ 3.00 a pound barrier and the July contract settle six percent up on the day at 314.18 cents . 
consuming and producing countries &apos; depleted coffee stocks , also hovering near 20-year lows , have been behind the sustained five-month run-up in futures . 
since the start of the year , the New York market has soared more than 175 percent . 
the latest fear among traders is that as cold weather sets in during the Brazilian winter next month , coffee trees could be damaged as they were during a hard frost in June 1994 . 
Arabica coffee beans , growing predominantly in Central and South America , are milder in flavour and are generally regarded as of better quality than robusta beans which form the bulk of the coffee crops in Asia &apos;s big growers , Indonesia and Vietnam . 
Robusta beans are not in such short supply worldwide as their arabica counterparts and prices have lagged behind , though the main London robusta futures market still rallied to a 20-month high on Thursday . 
instant coffee manufacturers use a blend of arabica and robusta coffees to achieve the required taste and are increasing the proportion of robusta as arabica supplies dwindle . 
in Indonesia , the world &apos;s third largest coffee producer and the biggest grower of robusta , the main Grade 40 coffee for export has risen to around $ 2,300 a tonne fob ( free on board ) compared with about $ 1,400 at the end of April . 
&quot; The Indonesians are going to make some money out of this , &quot; a veteran coffee trader in Singapore said . 
&quot; The farmers will reap a lot of money this year , but the crop is also down . 
I know of some farmers whose harvest will be 50 percent lower than what they had last year . 
that sort of evens out , &quot; another trader for a European dealing house said . 
one dealer said the Indonesian exporters who would benefit were those fixing their prices for nearby months in their contracts over the next few days . 
but those who pre-sold their crop before the recent rally erupted will lose out . 
traders estimate that between 60-80 percent of the Indonesian crop has already been harvested . 
the total exportable crop for this year will probably reach 240,000-260,000 tonnes , down sharply from the more than 300,000 tonnes last year . 
exporters in Vietnam , hoping for even higher prices , are believed to be holding back about 25,000 tonnes of robusta beans , which is all the stock estimated to be left from 260,000 tonnes at the end of the crop in February . 
in is much the same story in Thailand and India , two smaller Asian coffee growers . 
Thai exporters are now thought to be holding only 2,000 tonnes of coffee and sellers are ignoring escalating bids from buyers amid fears that some suppliers may default on contracts . 
India has already committed most of its coffee exports , estimated at 140,000 tonnes in the current season . 
around the region retail coffee prices are on the rise and industry sources said this will ultimately hit consumption , bringing the market back into balance . 
in Japan , the world &apos;s third largest coffee consumer after the U.S. and Germany , major roasters raised wholesale coffee prices by 20 percent this month , but the country has been importing more and stocks now stand at more than 20 percent above last year &apos;s levels . 
new Zealand &apos;s coffee wholesalers have recently increased prices between 15-20 percent and importers expect retail prices will have to go up by 50 percent . 
one importer said if frost did hit the Brazilian coffee growing season , then the price could jump to three times today &apos;s levels . 
each 10 percent price rise saw coffee consumption fall 1-2 percent , he said .
