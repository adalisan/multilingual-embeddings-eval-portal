a Jewish settler shot dead a Palestinian who entered a settlement area in the still-occupied Gaza Strip on Monday , Israeli security sources said . 
they said the shooting -- which coincided with a critical stage in Israeli-PLO negotiations over a long-delayed troop pullout in the West Bank town of Hebron -- took place in Kfar Darom settlement , in the past a frequent target of guerrilla attacks . 
the Israeli army confirmed the killing , but said the circumstances of the incident were still under investigation . 
Israel &apos;s army radio quoted the settler as saying he opened fire when the Palestinian attacked him . 
the settler was detained for questioning , it said . 
it was not immediately known if the dead man had been armed , an army spokeswoman said . 
witnesses said large numbers of Israeli soldiers and other security forces closed off the Kfar Darom area , an isolated enclave near Palestinian refugee camps . 
Israeli forces have turned over much of the Gaza Strip to Palestinian control under peace deals with the PLO . 
Jewish settlements remained in place in accordance with interim accords between the sides , but have been a focus of friction .
