European stock markets on Tuesday clawed back some of their losses following Wall Street &apos;s best one-day rally for three weeks overnight , although investors remained cautious ahead of U.S. economic data . 
the dollar held firm a little below its 37-month high of 1.7350 marks set overnight , while bond markets ticked higher . 
wall Street &apos;s 60 point rise drove European bourses during morning trade , but investors continued to fret at the prospect that U.S. consumer inflation ( CPI ) data due at 1230 GMT could underline fears of another rise in U.S. interest rates . 
stocks on both sides of the Atlantic suffered badly after strong U.S. wholesale figures last Friday , and similarly strong retail numbers would raise the likelihood of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan signalling another rate rise next month . 
the market reaction to Wall Street displayed by the major European bourses was reflected amongst second-tier markets too . 
among the majors , Frankfurt rebounded the most after being the biggest loser on Monday . 
the 30-share DAX benchmark was nearly 1.5 percent higher at 3,328 by early afternoon . 
dealers were focusing on the U.S. price data , but some traders said the German market was still underpinned by domestic fundamentals , including the weaker mark . 
carmakers sought to maintain their early gains , particularly VW , after a report showing a three percent drop in European new car registrations during March . 
London dealers rose moderately during the morning on the back of Wall Street , but traders identified a possible rise in interest rates as a continuing investor worry . 
&quot; This market is just messing about . 
there is no real conviction to go higher , &quot; one senior London equities dealer said . 
&quot; Unless we see Wall Street soar over the next couple of days the risk is still on the downside . 
French shares started one percent higher but later trimmed their gains to about 0.55 percent as caution took hold . 
LVMH was 4.2 percent higher at 1,341 francs after it reproted a big rise in first quarter sales . 
on the foreign exchange market , the prospect of higher U.S. rates was the dominating factor behind the dollar &apos;s strength and was reflected in a widening of the yield gap between U.S. and German 10-year bonds . 
&quot; With the inherent strength of the dollar we &apos;re looking for a high CPI number this afternoon . 
very few people are not expecting another couple of quarter-percent rate rises from Greenspan , &quot; said Peter Wood , trader at Bank of Boston . 
the dollar was quoted at 1.7337 marks and 126.20 yen after ending at 1.7228 marks and 126.45 yen in late trading in Europe on Monday . 
gold fixed lower at $ 345.60 against $ 346.75 on Monday . 
silver was unchanged at $ 4.73 .
