Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze said on Monday that he had met with a largely positive response to the idea of deploying a large multinational peacekeeping force in his country , whose Abkhazia region is under the control of separatists . 
&quot; Practically at every meeting there has been expressed a positive attitude towards the deployment of a multilateral , large-scale peacekeeping operation , &quot; Shevardnadze told reporters at the United Nations . 
&quot; Naturally , that will require the allocation of funds and there will be some structural and organisational work . 
but this must happen as soon as possible , &quot; he added . 
a 1,500-strong Russian-led peacekeeping force deployed by the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) has been patrolling a buffer zone between Georgia and the breakaway region of Abkhazia , from which Georgian troops were driven in 1993 along with hundreds of thousands of refugees . 
the mandate of the CIS troops expires on July 31 and Georgia has said they must leave if they do not agree to do more , including policing a wider zone and helping ethnic Georgian refugees to resettle . 
Shevardnadze , who visited Washington before coming to the United Nations , conferred with Secretary-General Kofi Annan , members of the Security Council and others concerned with the situation in Georgia . 
asked about a statement on Monday by Abkhaz leader Vladislav Ardzinba rejecting Georgia &apos;s call for U.N. peacekeepers , Shevardnadze , speaking through an interpreter , said : &quot; I don &apos;t know about it yet because I was busy , engaged here . 
and it &apos;s their business if they are saying &apos; No &apos; to it . 
but the United Nations can act according to its Charter and whatever its Charter allows , this can be done by the United Nations . 
Ardzinba said there would be no replacement for the Russian troops if they left and that the idea of an international force was an attempt by the Georgian government to use foreign countries to do its bidding . 
referring to talks between Georgian and Abkhazian representatives due to take place in Geneva from July 23 to 25 , Shevardnadze said they would include the so-called &quot; Friends of Georgia Group , &quot; comprising Russia , the United States , Britain , France and Germany . 
&quot; We have agreed that this is not going to be an isolated episode ... so there will be a special group of experts that will continue working after those meetings , and so it will continue until the conflict is resolved , &quot; he said . 
Shevardnadze said he considered all his meetings had been very useful , &quot; but it is still not the time for a celebration , because celebration will occur only after 300,000 refugees and displaced persons come back to Abkhazia and when the conflict has been finally settled . 
the U.N. secretary-general , in a report to the Security Council Monday , recommended extending until January 31 , 1998 , the mandate of just over 100 U.N. observers stationed in Georgia . 
the current mandate of the U.N. Observer Mission in Georgia ( UNOMIG ) expires July 31 . 
but noting that the mandate of the CIS peacekeepers also expired then , Annan said the extension of the U.N. force &quot; should be subject to an early review by the council if decisions taken by the governments of the states that make up CIS result in changes in the mandate of that force .
