Istanbul shares eased in quiet trade on Friday amid persisting political worries , brokers said . 
the IMKB National-100 closed at 1,467 , down four points , or 0.27 percent from Thursday . 
over the week , it lost 1.7 percent . 
trade volume firmed slightly to 12.03 trillion lira ( $ 86.8 million ) from Thursday &apos;s 11.01 trillion ( $ 79.6 million ) . 
brokers said the resignation of a second deputy from the conservative True Path Party ( DYP ) , the junior coalition partner , sparked selling in early afternoon trade and caused the index to fall to a low of 1,447 . 
it rebounded in late trade . 
&quot; Such resignations prompted sales at first , but afterwards there was buying on expectations of a new government . 
but it is not possible to expect a healthy rise until political stability is restored , &quot; Sid Erden Gokay from Taksim securities . 
DYP deputy Hikmet Aydin gave his resignation in the afternoon after Samil Ayrim stepped down in a row over Islamist activism earlier in the day . 
&quot; The thought that the Islamist-led coalition is unraveling negatively affects the market . 
on the other hand , the expectation of an alternative ( secularist ) alliance is vague . 
therefore , I expect the index to go down towards 1,380 in coming days , &quot; said Serdar surer from Ekinciler securities . 
the market awaits two meetings to be attended by top military generals and Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan . 
the secularist army had urged the government to take tough measures against rising Islamist activism at a February meeting . 
the coalition , ailing since the February meeting survived a censure motion by a close vote in parliament on Tuesday .
