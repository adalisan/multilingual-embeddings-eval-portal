ethnic Zairean Tutsis fighting Zaire &apos;s troops on Friday were reported to have seized the airport in the eastern Zairean town of Uvira and cut off satellite and radio communications , Western aid workers said . 
the reports could not be confirmed independently but the aid workers in Geneva , citing field reports , said Tutsi Banyamulenge fighters , resisting Zairean attempts to force them back to Rwanda , took the Kiliba airport in Uvira and many people were fleeing the town . 
aid workers said they had lost telephone and radio contact with their local staff in Uvira earlier on Friday . 
Western aid agencies have evacuated international staff from the town . 
earlier , aid workers reported heavy fighting in Uvira and said a local U.N. radio operator in the city had said on Thursday night that he would stop transmitting as the rebels were about to take the area . 
he then went off the air . 
fighting in the region broke out after Banyamulenge Tutsis , who came to Zaire as long ago as the end of the 18th century , resisted Zairean attempts to drive them from their land and force them back into Rwanda . 
Zairean troops , unpaid for months , have been forced to retreat . 
Zaire has accused Rwanda of invading but Rwanda has denied the charge .
