after a series of failed attempts to rally , coffee looks more likely to break lower , technical analysts said . 
traders called benchmark September due to open $ 10 up . 
&quot; For the last two weeks coffee has traded below resistance from $ 1,695 upwards , &quot; Trevor Neil , senior technical analyst at Union Cal futures , said . 
&quot; This resistance is capping rally attempts . 
&quot; The most likely outcome is for coffee to break lower , &quot; he said . 
if there were a break lower he predicted a significant move , through $ 1,477 . 
there would then be &quot; massive &quot; resistance above the new price , from January through to April , giving coffee a long-term cap . 
&quot; To turn bullish coffee needs to clear the June-early July resistance extending up to $ 1,975 , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Only a move through there takes the pressure off . 
new York coffee futures ended lower on Wednesday , as speculators took profits following two straight sessions of hefty gains , traders said .
