the three most heavily weighted shares on the Prague bourse , SPT Telecom , CEZ and Komercni Banka , rose on Monday and accounted for the bulk of trading on the PX50 . 
but widespread losses among less heavily capitalised shares ensured that the PX50 lost 0.3 points to 503.8 - its eighth successive decline . 
however , dealers said that sustained price falls in the month of October were likely to bring new buyers back into the market , especially for the most highly capitalised shares which on Monday accounted for the bulk of trading on the bourse 
&quot; They are looking quite cheap but also those stocks particularly are watched by foreign investors and domestic ( alike ) , &quot; he added . 
CEZ was the biggest gainer of the three , rising 28 crowns to 980 . 
SPT Telecom was unchanged on 2,885 and Komercni Banka rose four crowns to 2,130 in what dealers described as an erratic trading day for the issue .
