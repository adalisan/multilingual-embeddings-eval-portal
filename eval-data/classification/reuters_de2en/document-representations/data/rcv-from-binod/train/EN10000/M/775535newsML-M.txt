Australian bonds saw a brisk start as the market got back into full swing after Monday &apos;s New South Wales state holiday and tried to hold its ground against further weakness in U.S. treasuries . 
the local market was marked down sharply on Monday in the wake of a massive sell-off in the U.S. , which followed stronger than expected non-farm payrolls and data showing a buoyant manufacturing , although domestic interest was illiquid . 
however , with Australia clearly at a different stage of the cycle analysts saw scope for local market to outperform the U.S. and for yield differentials to compress . 
Australia &apos;s inflation is currently far superior to that of the U.S. , on the demand side retail trade remains benign , and Thursday &apos;s domestic labour force report is likely to inspire any thoughts of a recovery . 
&quot; We are different to the U.S. &quot; said Stephen Roberts , chief economist at UBS Australia . 
&quot; It implies that if you are looking for the Fed to get a but trigger happy ( on policy ) , perhaps not on the August 19 meeting , but the one after , it &apos;s going to be a long way down the track before the Reserve Bank finds itself on the same side of the ledger , &quot; he added . 
the RBA cut official interest rates to 5.0 percent last week , and while a recent poll of economists gave only a 30 percent chance of a further easing , a majority did not expect a tightening until the second half of 1998 . 
meanwhile , the U.S. faces the first of three quarterly refunding auctions later on Tuesday with US $ 16.0 billion of three-year notes up for grabs . 
ten-year bonds outperformed against the U.S. , putting support at 25 basis points under pressure and the lowest level since the early 1980s . 
the Canadian bond market was closed on Monday . 
the short end of the New Zealand curve weakened after its employment report was stronger than expected .
