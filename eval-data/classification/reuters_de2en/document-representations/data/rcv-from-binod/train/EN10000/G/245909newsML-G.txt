&quot; The president signed two decrees today . 
the first one sacked Tabachnyk in connection with his transfer to another post . 
the second one stripped him of three military ranks which he got in the last three years , &quot; the source told Reuters . 
Tabachnyk , 33 , described by the media as &quot; the president &apos;s shadow &quot; and widely regarded as one of the country &apos;s most influential politicians , has come in for sharp criticism in paraliament , including several calls for his resignation since Kuchma took office in July 1994 . 
a parliamentary anti-corruption commission is conducting an official investigation into allegations that Tabachnyk had illegally used his position to obtain a second apartment in Kiev , an accusation he has denied . 
Tabachnyk ran Kuchma &apos;s media campaign in the run-up to his election victory . 
the president has said he plans to seek re-election in 1999 .
