Japan &apos;s trade surplus rose last month for the first time in two years , as the weaker yen triggered a shift in the trade balance that economists said could lead to friction with overseas trading partners . 
the trade surplus rose 6.5 percent in February to 686.72 billion yen ( $ 5.53 billion ) , the first increase since November 1994 , according to official statistics released on Monday . 
the sensitive trade surplus with the United States -- which has voiced concern recently about a possible increase in the Japanese surplus -- grew by 12.3 percent to 407.35 billion yen ( $ 3.28 billion ) . 
economists said the data signalled a change in the tide , with the trend now towards a rising surplus . 
they saw this as linked to a fall in the yen , which has accelerated Japan &apos;s exports while putting a brake on imports . 
&quot; I think ( these figures ) are certainly indicating that the trend is starting to change . 
we should be seeing from now on the Japanese surplus starting to pick up fairly steadily , &quot; said Jason James , strategist at HSBC James Capel . 
the dollar averaged 121.18 yen in February , according to Finance Ministry calculations , against 106.38 yen a year earlier , a depreciation of nearly 14 percent during the period . 
the weaker yen has made Japanese products more competitive overseas , while boosting the price of imports into Japan . 
a Finance Ministry official said the surplus was still on a downward trend , although the pace of the decline was slowing , and cited surging exports as one factor . 
in quantitative terms , exports rose 7.6 percent in February from a year earlier while imports dropped 2.7 percent . 
economists said the rise in exports showed that Japanese economic growth was being led by external demand . 
&quot; ( The surplus ) brings a plus impact on the Japanese economy -- much higher growth of Japanese exports , but relatively weak imports , &quot; said Masaru Takagi , chief economist at Fuji Research Institute . 
HSBC James Capel &apos;s James said the surplus was starting to contribute positively to Japanese growth instead of negatively as it has done for the past three years . 
but this conflicts with the Japanese government &apos;s goal of seeking growth led by domestic demand and could trigger renewed trade tensions , especially with the United States . 
in recent months the United States has voiced concern that Japan &apos;s trade surplus was about to start climbing again and has urged Tokyo to ensure its economic recovery is fuelled by domestic growth , not resurgent exports . 
car exports to the United States grew by 15.4 percent in value terms in February from a year earlier . 
the Japanese government played down the significance of the data and possible political repercussions . 
&quot; I do not hold the view that the huge ( trade ) surplus is necessarily rapidly increasing , &quot; Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama , the government &apos;s top spokesman , told a news conference . 
the figures had only a limited impact on the currency market , which had been expecting the surplus to rise . 
but dealers said the changing trade pattern could push up the value of the yen in the longer term , as exporters will need to exchange their growing export earnings for yen . 
&quot; We cannot ignore this . 
if it ( the surplus ) keeps on accumulating , it &apos;ll put a lid on the dollar , &quot; said Yasuhito Kawashima , chief manager of foreign exchange at Toyo Trust &amp; Banking Co . 
although U.S. authorities have shown no sign of using the exchange rate as a tool to control trade imbalances , the market will be on the alert for any hint of a policy shift , he said .
