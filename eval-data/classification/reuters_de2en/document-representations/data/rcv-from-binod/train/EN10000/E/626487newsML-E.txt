Colombia should return to growth soon after plunging into recession for the first time in decades , the World Bank &apos;s chief Latin American economist Guillermo Perry said . 
&quot; I &apos;m sure that at some time this year the recovery will set in , or early next year . 
there is no good reason why it should not , &quot; Perry told Reuters in a telephone interview from Cartagena , where he was hosting a World Bank conference . 
Colombian gross domestic product fell 1.22 percent in the first quarter , in part due to an exceptionally poor 1996 / 7 coffee harvest . 
the drop was the second consecutive quarterly fall . 
government officials have said 3.5 percent growth for the year is still possible and have forecast the economy will bounce back in the second half -- led by oil and coffee and helped by low interest rates .
