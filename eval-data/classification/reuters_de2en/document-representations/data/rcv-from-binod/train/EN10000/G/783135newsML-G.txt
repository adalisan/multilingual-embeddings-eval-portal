the latest opinion poll on the European Union &apos;s Amsterdam Treaty reforms shows Danish supporters , opponents and those unsure how they would vote if a referendum were held now running neck and neck . 
the survey by the sonar Institute , published in the leading daily newspaper Jyllands-Posten on Wednesday , showed that 35 percent would vote to accept the new treaty agreed at an EU summit in Amsterdam in June , and 34 percent would reject it , with 31 percent unsure or not intending to vote . 
previous polls have shown a narrow majority of Danes in favour of the treaty , with almost half of samples undecided . 
Danish prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has said that he will ask Danes to vote on the Amsterdam Treaty changes early next year , but has set no date as yet . 
Danes , who traditionally have a lukewarm attitude to Europe , shocked their fellow EU members when they flatly rejected the Maastricht Treaty on closer European cooperation in a referendum in 1992 . 
they only voted to ratify the treaty in the following year on condition that Denmark opt out of economic and monetary union , a joint defence structure , cross-border policing and common asylum policy .
