Finland &apos;s Tommi Makinen , became world champion for the first time with an emphatic victory in the Australian rally on Monday . 
Makinen , 32 , cruised through the final day of the 1,560-kilometre rally to take his fifth victory of the season and become the first driver to win more than half the rounds of the World Rally Championship in one year . 
&quot; It &apos;s an unbelievable feeling . 
of course it was really quite a lot of pressure today , even though I wasn &apos;t in a hurry . 
the car is unbelievable , &quot; declared a beaming Makinen who also became the first Mitsubishi driver to clinch the title . 
Makinen finished in 4 hours 08 minutes 50 seconds , 1 minute 17 seconds ahead of Sweden &apos;s Kenneth Ericksson in a Subaru and a further four seconds ahead of former world champion Spaniard Carlos Sainz in a Ford Escort . 
if Sainz had finished second he would have prolonged the battle for the title until the Sanremo Rally next month . 
he made a last-gasp charge to overtake Ericksson but just failed by four seconds . 
Sainz though , did well to finish third after twice coming off the road while Eriksson cracked part of his car &apos;s transmission system on a massive jump and completed the rally leaking oil . 
Britain &apos;s Colin McRae was a subdued fourth , but took his first finish for Subaru in three months , just seconds ahead of fellow countryman Richard Burns . 
I was sure I could have gone a lot quicker , but as soon as you try to alter your pace in this rally , it &apos;s a risk , &quot; commented McRae , who was anxious to finish after a spate of accidents . 
&quot; I &apos;m reasonably happy , &quot; said Burns who equalled his best Australia result in his Mitsubishi . 
Belgian Bruno Thiry nearly lost sixth place almost within sight of the finish . 
severe electrical problems cost the Ford man two minutes on the final stage and the car stopped twice in the closing kilometres . 
Thiry only reached the end by getting his co-driver to clamp part of the electrical system together as they threaded their way through the Perth traffic . 
the Sanremo Rally , the next round in the championship starts on October 13 .
