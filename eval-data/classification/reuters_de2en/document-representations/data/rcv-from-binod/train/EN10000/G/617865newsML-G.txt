Manfred von Ardenne , a German inventor who pioneered work on projects as diverse as television , atomic weapons and cancer therapy , has died at the age of 90 . 
Ardenne &apos;s research institute in the eastern city of Dresden said on Tuesday its head , who had worked under both Hitler and Stalin during a life packed with incident and invention , had died peacefully on Monday night after a short illness . 
born to an aristocratic family in Hamburg in 1907 , von Ardenne registered the first of around 600 scientific patents at the age of just 16 . 
his early research work dealt with radio , the birth of television and radar technology . 
he founded his first research institute at the age of 21 in Berlin , where he produced a groundbreaking electronic television set and the first high-definition electron microscope . 
von Ardenne , who shunned his aristocratic title of &quot; Baron &quot; , worked increasingly in the field of atomic physics during the 1930s , carrying out projects in the field for the Nazis . 
after World War Two he worked on the Soviet Union &apos;s atomic weapons programme at a Black Sea research institute . 
returning home in 1955 , von Ardenne set up base in Dresden and his research institute became the largest employer in East Germany &apos;s tiny private sector . 
nicknamed the &quot; Red Baron &quot; by citizens in the communist state , he devoted himself increasingly to medical research . 
&quot; After working on the atomic bomb , it was good to do something humane , &quot; he told Reuters in a 1991 interview . 
some of his cancer therapy techniques were highly controversial . 
they involved heating up a patient &apos;s body and adding sugar and oxygen to the bloodstream in an attempt to kill malignant cells .
