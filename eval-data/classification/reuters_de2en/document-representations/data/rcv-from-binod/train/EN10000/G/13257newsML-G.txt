North Lebanon voted on Sunday in the second round of Lebanon &apos;s parliamentary elections and observers reported a sharp drop in electoral abuses after charges of widespread vote-rigging in the first round . 
troops in armoured vehicles patrolled this predominantly Sunni Moslem port city as voting began . 
officials said rival campaign workers scuffled outside a polling station and a man was badly hurt in a fight in the far north region of Akkar , but there were no other reports of violence . 
some 580,000 voters were eligible to elect 28 deputies to the 128-member parliament . 
mount Lebanon , the Christian heartland , elected 35 deputies last Sunday and Beirut , south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley vote on the next four Sundays . 
last week losing Christian opposition candidates demanded the resignation of President Elias Hrawi and Interior Minister Michel al-Murr , charging widespread abuses after supporters of the pro-Syrian government won 32 of 35 seats in Mount Lebanon . 
officials said 20 percent of votes in North Lebanon were cast by 2 p.m. ( 1100 GMT ) compared with a total 31 percent vote there in 1992 when most Christians and many Moslems boycotted the poll . 
fears of a repeat of last week &apos;s electoral abuses failed to materialise . 
&quot; There are some breaches but in general it is much calmer than Mount Lebanon , &quot; Paul Salem , secretary-general of the Lebanese Association for the Democracy of Elections ( LADE ) , told Reuters in Tripoli . 
LADE said police were positioned illegally inside some election booths and authorities gave candidates voter lists at the last minute . 
Maronite Christian candidate Mikhail Daher said many people found their names were not on voting lists and officials were summoning voters and telling them who to vote for . 
Daher said he telephoned Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri to protest at the &quot; scandalous &quot; the way the vote was being run . 
newspapers have dubbed the vote in the north , where four government ministers and 26 parliamentary deputies are seeking election , the most confusing round of the five-stage election . 
five rival tickets are based on local alliances and personal rivalries and offer no clear choice between the government and opposition . 
almost all candidates are friends of Syria , whose 35,000 troops give it a powerful say in Lebanese affairs and a close interest in the vote . 
supporters of Hariri , who is trying to build a national political base and is running in Beirut , were running on different tickets , sometimes side-by-side with his enemies . 
the most prominent list was headed by two foes of Hariri : Omar Karami , a former prime minister and Sunni Moslem , and Suleiman Franjieh , a Maronite Christian and former minister . 
but their list included three Hariri supporters . 
the main rival list of Karami &apos;s cousin Ahmed Karami also included three Hariri supporters beside three of the Sunni Moslem fundamentalist group Gama &apos;a Islamiyeh which opposes him . 
the Gama &apos;a is allied with the pro-Iranian Shi &apos;ite Moslem Hizbollah which Hariri has denounced as &quot; extremist &quot; and vowed to crush in the election .
