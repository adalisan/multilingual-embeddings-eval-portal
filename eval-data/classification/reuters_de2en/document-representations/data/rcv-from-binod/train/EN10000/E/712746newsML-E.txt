Poland &apos;s budget deficit next year will be sufficiently small not to cause any further widening of the country &apos;s large trade gap , Finance Minister Marek Belka said on Tuesday . 
&quot; I think the reduction of the budget deficit that we were planing for next year is sufficient to arrest the growth of the trade deficit , &quot; Belka said . 
after the first four months of the year Poland &apos;s trade gap was $ 4 billion , twice as much as in the same period last year . 
the finance ministry wants to cut the deficit to 1.9 percent of the gross domestic product from 2.8 percent planned for 1997 , but the independent central bank says that Poland can only afford a 1.5 percent budget gap and should aim at a balanced budget as quickly as possible . 
the National Bank of Poland has said the government should balance its books in 1999 or face a Czech-style currency crisis stemming from a ballooning trade gap which would be fuelled by high domestic demand for imports . 
but the Polish Peasant Party ( PSL ) , the junior partner in the ruling left-wing coalition with the ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance ( SLD ) , wants the deficit at 2.8 percent of GDP , saying otherwise the economy &apos;s growth would be throttled . 
Belka , speaking at a reception after Poland &apos;s successful Yankee bond launch , said he was confident the government would resist pressure from the PSL to raise the deficit . 
it is easier to construct and defend the budget in 1997 , a few months before the elections , than it was last year , &quot; Belka said . 
asked if government subsidies for the inefficient mining and energy sectors would get the axe Belka said : 
&quot; We are proposing cuts in real terms and in some cases even in nominal terms .
