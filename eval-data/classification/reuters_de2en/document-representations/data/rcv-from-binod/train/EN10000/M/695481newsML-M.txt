the Zimbabwe dollar was quoted mixed against hard currencies on Monday with dealers expecting it to stabilise on the key U.S. dollar after last week &apos;s steep fall . 
the local currency lost seven cents on the U.S. dollar last week on the back of import pressure which overwhelmed the export resources available , prompting the central Reserve Bank to intervene on Friday to smoothen the decline . 
&quot; We &apos;ve seen a big movement over a short space of time and I think now the dollar should stabilise or even appreciate a little , &quot; one dealer said on Monday . 
however at around 0810 GMT , the local currency was trading softer on the U.S. unit at 11.3950 / 4050 compared to Friday &apos;s 11.3825 / 3925 but was little changed at 18.9400 / 9600 from 18.9400 / 9685 versus sterling . 
it firmed to 6.5400 / 5600 from 6.5650 / 5725 against the mark and to 2.5100 / 5175 on the rand from 2.5195 / 5235 .
