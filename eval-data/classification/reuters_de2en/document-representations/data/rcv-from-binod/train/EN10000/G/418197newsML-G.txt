a Security Council debate scheduled to begin on Tuesday on Israel &apos;s decision to build a new Jewish neighbourhood in East Jerusalem was postponed until Wednesday at the request of the United States . 
&quot; The United States is very pleased that the Security Council has honoured our request for a 24-hour postponement of the discussion on the settlements issue , &quot; U.S. ambassador Bill Richardson told reporters after closed-door council consultations . 
he said President Bill Clinton and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat &quot; held some very good talks yesterday on the whole comprehensive peace process . 
&quot; We felt that a short delay would be helpful and we look forward tomorrow to a briefing by Chairman Arafat in the morning and then a discussion of the settlements issue in the afternoon , &quot; he added . 
asked what would be achieved by a delay , Richardson said : &quot; It would be helpful to discuss this issue in the Security Council after President Clinton and Chairman Arafat had a very good discussion ... that ... led towards the creation of an American-Palestinian joint committee that would meet on a regular basis to discuss economic and cultural and other isues . 
we just felt a brief delay would be helpful . 
Arafat , currently in Washington , was due in New York late Tuesday and was scheduled to attend a reception at the United Nations . 
Wednesday morning he was scheduled to confer with Secretary-General Kofi Annan and meet informally with Security Council members . 
later on Wednesday , he is scheduled to fly to Houston , Texas , for meetings with former President George Bush and former Secretary of State James Baker and to speak at the James Baker Institute for public policy at Rice University .
