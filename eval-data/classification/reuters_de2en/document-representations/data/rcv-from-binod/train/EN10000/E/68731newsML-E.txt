Singapore expects to spend Singapore $ 18 million ( US $ 12.8 million ) to play host to nearly 5,000 delegates at the World Trade Organisation ministerial meeting in December , one of its ministers said on Saturday . 
the delegates and participants include representatives from 150 countries and from many inter-government organisations and non-governmental organisations , Minister for Trade and Industry Yeo Cheow Tong told a news conference . 
&quot; The inaugural ministerial conference in Singapore has the very important task of conducting a comprehensive and critical review on the progress of Uruguay Round implementation , &quot; he said . 
another important task was to ensure the momentum of global trade liberalisaion was mantained . 
on whether issues like investment , labour standards and government procurement should be discussed at the WTO , Yeo said the key word is &quot; relevance &quot; . 
&quot; WTO and its first ministeral conference should not be distracted from its core activities by considering issues that are not relevant to trade , &quot; he said . 
some Western industrialised nations are pushing for the WTO to take up issues such as working conditions and liberalising investment rules , but those proposals have received a cool reception from Asian , African and South American countries . 
Yeo said Singapore was making detailed information on the conference available on a website on the internet ( http : / / www.wto 96.org ) .
