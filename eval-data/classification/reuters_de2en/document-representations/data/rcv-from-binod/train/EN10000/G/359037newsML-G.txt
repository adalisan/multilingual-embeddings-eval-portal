Syrian Vice-President Abdel-Halim Khaddam , on a tour of North African countries to build support for Syria &apos;s stand in Middle East peace process , met Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on Tuesday night . 
the official Libyan news agency Jana , monitored in Tunis , reported on Wednesday that Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara handed to Gaddafi a message from Syrian President Hafez al-Assad . 
it said Assad affirmed in his message Syria &apos;s opposition to last month &apos;s deal between Israel and the Palestinian Authority on the West Bank town of Hebron . 
he also called on Arab states to stick to their rights , Jana said . 
Khaddam later left Tripoli where he arrived a few hours earlier after a visit to Morocco where he met King Hassan on Monday . 
Syria says it would resume negotiations with Israel only after the Jewish state agreed to return the Golan Heights occupied by Israel in 1967 . 
Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refuses to commit itself to the principle of returning land for peace . 
Damascus says Israel &apos;s previous Labour-led government had committed itself to a complete withdrawal from the Golan .
