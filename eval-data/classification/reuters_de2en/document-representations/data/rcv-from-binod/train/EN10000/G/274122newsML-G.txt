premier Richard Court and Minister for Resources Colin Barnett were re-elected today as the leader and deputy leader of the Western Australian Parliamentary Liberal Party at the first meeting of Liberal MPs since the state election . 
Court was returned unopposed but Barnett had to survive a challenge from Industrial Relations Minister , Graham Kierath . 
at a press conference held shortly after the meeting , Court refused to disclose the results of the ballot for deputy leader but said the mood of the meeting was &quot; very good &quot; . 
&quot; It was accepted by everyone that all positions would be thrown open , &quot; Court said . 
&quot; We have just completed a very successful four years in government . 
the challenge for us now is to make sure we deliver on the commitments we gave in the election campaign . 
asked about the composition of his new Cabinet , Court said this would not be finalised until after negotiations with his Coalition partner , the National Party .
