Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo said on Tuesday that second-quarter growth of 7.2 percent was a clear sign that the Mexican economy was recovering from a crisis that began in December 1994 . 
&quot; This means not only that the contraction has ended , but also that we have entered clearly into an expansion phase , &quot; Zedillo told the National Chamber of Commerce in a speech . 
the government said Sunday night that the gross domestic product grew by 7.2 percent in the second quarter of 1996 compared with the same period a year earlier . 
it was the first quarter of growth since the December 1994 peso devaluation led to a severe contraction of the economy . 
Zedillo added that the current phase was one &quot; of recovery for our country .
