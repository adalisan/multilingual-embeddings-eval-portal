Algerian President Liamine Zeroual met leaders of eight political parties on Thursday to discuss when local elections would be held this year . 
the official news agency APS said Zeroual wanted to discuss the date and organisation of the elections and had invited all political party leaders to the talks . 
APS said among those at the talks were the National Democratic Rally ( RND ) , the Movement of a Peaceful Society and the National Liberation Front . 
the three parties on Wednesday night formed a coalition government dominated by RND members . 
Zeroual has promised to hold local elections this year to finish restructuring the political map after years of violence . 
at the last local elections , held in 1990 , candidates of the Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) swept to power in more than half the country &apos;s town halls and 48 provinces . 
the FIS went on to take a massive lead in Algeria &apos;s first multi-party general election in December 1991 . 
the following month the authorities scrapped the poll and the North African nation plunged into violence . 
about 60,000 people have been killed . 
the authorities outlawed the FIS and replaced its elected local and provincial councils with government appointees . 
earlier this month , Algeria held multi-party parliamentary elections from which radical Islamists were barred .
