a South African television drama about three boyhood friends won praise on Thursday as the most ambitious effort so far to capture the essence of life under apartheid . 
the makers of &quot; Homeland &quot; hope their series will do far more than death-squad trials and truth commission hearings to help ordinary blacks and whites understand how apartheid operated and how it shaped each other &apos;s lives . 
&quot; Homeland is the first English South African serial which really rubs at the national core , shaving away at the deceit and betrayal which have scarred the nation , &quot; the Johannesburg Star newspaper said . 
the 13-part series that began on Wednesday spans three decades and shows how two white boys and their black friend from a rare mixed Johannesburg suburb grow up and are driven apart . 
Director Neal Sundstrom said he saw the story as &quot; a catharsis for apartheid &quot; , and just a beginning . 
&quot; The Americans have made at least 40 movies about Vietnam and they still haven &apos;t exhausted the subject , &quot; he said . 
many South Africans , carefully segregated by race in all but a few &quot; grey &quot; neighbourhoods , remained largely ignorant about how people from other races lived . 
the state-owned South African Broadcasting Corporation , which brought television to the country in 1976 , hopes to sell Homeland abroad . 
images from the first episode , helping to recreate the atmosphere on the early 1960s , included British singer Cliff Richard , hula-hoops and the Sharpeville massacre .
