Italian bond futures held to higher levels in late afternoon chased bunds and T-bonds higher after tame U.S. March CPI data pushed U.S. bonds up and underpinned an across the board bond market rise , dealers said . 
U.S. March CPI showed a rise of just 0.1 percent after market expectations of an 0.2 percent increase , and so eased pressures on the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten interest rates further , they added . 
&quot; Market players are focusing on lower Italy inflation and interest rates , so the U.S. data just added to the generally positive sentiment around the market , &quot; dealers said . 
dealers added that the market was heartened by an expected fall in April &apos;s preliminary CPI next week which is set to see annual CPI dip below two percent and could spark a cut in Italian interest rates before the end of the month . 
the European Monetary Institute today urged EU nations towards tougher financial budgets as they head nearer EMU , but the market continues to hopes that Italy will be in the first wave of the single European currency . 
&quot; For the moment , the government &apos;s political problems have been forgotten and we are looking to go higher , &quot; said another LIFFE trader . 
Italian industrial production in February fell 3.8 percent year / year unadjusted versus a 6.4 percent January decline , which together with a stronger lira continued to fuel hopes of a cut in Italian interest rates , dealers added .
