the Hungarian forint closed easier against the dollar on Friday after tracking the dollar / mark cross all day , dealers said . 
the unit remained at the National Bank of Hungary &apos;s resistance level ( NBH bid ) for all but a brief period when strong buying interest prized it to five pips from the bid , dealers said . 
the forint finished at 176.50 / 55 , compared with an opening level of 176.24 / 29 . 
&quot; The shorter Friday session meant someone was in a hurry to get their purchase in but it was not a significant move and the forint returned to the bid by the close , &quot; said Zsolt Tilimon of Citibank . 
&quot; Otherwise it was a very silent session with the forint following the dollar / mark cross . 
the forint floats within the NBH &apos;s 4.5 percent wide intervention range against a currency basket made up 70 percent of the mark and 30 percent of the dollar ..
