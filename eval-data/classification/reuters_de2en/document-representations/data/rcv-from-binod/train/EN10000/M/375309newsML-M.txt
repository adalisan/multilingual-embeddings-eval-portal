benchmark 48-hour peso contracts closed slightly weaker on Thursday after closing firmer for five straight sessions , due to swaps ahead of the weekend , traders said . 
nonetheless , traders said the peso shrugged off adverse circumstances . 
&quot; The peso still closed stronger than 7.80 per dollar , despite swaps and lack of dollar inflow , &quot; a trader said . 
the benchmark 48-hour peso closed 0.7 of a centavo weaker at 7.7940 / 7.7960 per dollar , while its 24-hour stablemate was unchnaged at 7.7810 / 7.7830 per dollar . 
same-day peso contracts closed earlier 1.3 centavos firmer at 7.7740 / 7.7770 per dollar . 
dealers said 48-hour contracts were in heavy demand as they do not have to be settled until Tuesday because U.S. markets will be closed on Monday , February 17 , for President &apos;s Day . 
the advantage , they said , was that dollars could be sold in the same-day market and bought back at 48 hours , with pesos that may be invested in the money market for five days . 
traders differed as to whether or not the peso had scope to gain ground against the dollar . 
&quot; We feel there are more and more domestic players short on dollars who will not be able to hold out for long without squaring positions , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; It will be enough for one player to step in to buy dollars for the rest to follow suit . 
other traders felt the peso could head for resistance at 7.77 per dollar before receding to 7.80 . 
&quot; The peso did not firm up today because they took profits on the bourse , but when the rally gets under way again then the peso could gain ground , &quot; another trader said . 
dealers said they would keep a close eye on reaction in the U.S. bond markets to Producer Price Index data due to be announced in early trade on Friday .
