Brady bond prices were sharply higher in late trade sparked by a run-up in U.S. Treasury prices , emerging market sources said . 
&quot; There was substantial tightening today . 
on average 25 to 30 basis points of tightening , &quot; said one emerging market debt trader at a U.S. investment bank . 
while many market participants expect a tightening of 25 basis points in U.S. interest rates , emerging market sources said there was a growing consensus that a move by the Federal Reserve Bank would not happen until the May FOMC meeting . 
&quot; Most opinions I &apos;ve heard are now talking about a Fed hike but they are not talking about a Fed hike in March , they are talking about a Fed hike in May , &quot; said a head trader of a major U.S. investment bank . 
sources said strong buying across the board helped to push prices sharply higher . 
&quot; We saw a lot of buyers across the board . 
we saw buying from locals , institutional investors and hedge funds . 
the market was extremely oversold , &quot; the second source said . 
meanwhile , comments by Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Cathy Minehan that signs of tight U.S. Labor markets are a warning of inflation failed to rattle the market , emerging market debt sources said . 
Minehan , speaking at Middlebury College in Vermont , said : &quot; These signals of Labor market tightness in the face of above trend growth clearly sound inflation alarm bells . 
one market expert said : &quot; We have already heard that . 
elsewhere , Peru closed its long-awaited Brady plan with commercial bank creditors today in New York covering an original principal amount of $ 4.3 billion in medium- and long-term commercial debt . 
under the Brady plan , the Peruvian government issued $ 560 million in discount bonds , $ 182 million in par bonds , $ 1.7 billion in front-loaded interest reduction bonds and $ 2.4 billion in past-due interest bonds . 
the government also repurchased $ 2.6 billion of principal and past-due interest of eligible debt under a debt buyback . 
among Eastern European instruments , Bulgarian Bradys continued higher on hopes that an agreement on a funding program would be reached with the International Monetary Fund next week . 
Bulgarian IABs were 2-1 / 8 higher at 61-5 / 8 .
