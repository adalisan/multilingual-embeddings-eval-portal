the dollar rose against most major currencies Tuesday after an important group of German economists predicted it would rally in coming months and U.S. negotiators reportedly neared a deal on the federal budget . 
the dollar also benefited from official Japanese comments suggesting major central banks will not enter the markets to stop the dollar &apos;s rise against the Japanese yen . 
&quot; This market does like to test the toleration level of the central banks ( for the dollar ) and we have yet to find that level , &quot; said Seth Garrett , a director of foreign exchange at Credit Suisse First Boston . 
Rumors swirled throughout the U.S. trading session that Congressional and White House negotiators were close to agreement on a plan to balance the federal budget by 2002 . 
late in the day , a White House spokesman said President Bill Clinton would discuss the budget with Congressional Democrats on Wednesday . 
us stocks and bonds also rallied on the news , helping the dollar post fresh highs . 
the Dow soared 173 points , or 2.6 percent , as the 30-year Treasury bond rose a half-point . 
&quot; A budget deal would definitely be bullish in the short term , &quot; said Garrett . 
the dollar rose to 1.7170 / 75 marks from 1.7065 / 75 at the open and 1.6980 / 85 at Monday &apos;s close . 
the dollar also rose to 126.30 / 35 yen from 126.15 / 25 at the open and 125.32 / 37 Monday . 
a group of six leading German economic research institutes predicted in their semiannual report that the dollar would trade at an average rate of 1.80 German marks in 1998 . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see a strong economy in Germany and the fundamental picture is much better ( in the United States ) . 
I think within six months we could see the dollar at 1.80 marks , &quot; said James Powers , vice president of corporate foreign exchange at Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale . 
the dollar rose in Asian trading when Japan &apos;s Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told parliament not to expect aggressive support for the yen at an official meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations this weekend in Washington . 
Mitsuzuka said the meeting would probably produce a statement similar to one released at the February G7 meeting in Berlin , which simply said the group would deal with excessive currency movements as appropriate . 
&quot; The market took that as a sign the United States and Germany don &apos;t care about the strong dollar as much as Japan does , &quot; said Powers . 
yet investors refrained from making aggressive bets on the dollar ahead of the meeting as a precaution against a surprise statement or market intervention to weaken the dollar . 
&quot; Nobody wants to take the dollar too high before the G7 meets , &quot; said Mike Malpede , senior foreign exchange analyst at Refco Group Ltd . 
comments from a Swiss official helped accelerate the dollar &apos;s rise against European currencies , dealers said . 
near 1200 EDT / 1700 GMT Swiss National Bank Vice Chairman Jean-Pierre Roth said he saw no reason to expect Swiss interest rates to move in either direction in the near term . 
traders interpreted that as a sign the SNB sees the Swiss economy as too weak to tolerate higher interest rates , which would tend to boost the Swiss franc . 
&quot; That &apos;s partly why the dollar was so strong , &quot; Malpede said . 
the dollar rose to 1.4630 / 40 Swiss francs from 1.4518 / 28 at the open and 1.4413 / 23 at Monday &apos;s close . 
cable fell to $ 1.6330 / 40 from $ 1.6358 / 68 at the open . 
the Australian dollar fell to $ 0.7768 / 73 from $ 0.7785 / 90 .
