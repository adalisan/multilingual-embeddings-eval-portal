Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori arrived in Bolivia on Friday for talks on the deadlocked Lima hostage crisis in which a Bolivian diplomat is one of the 72 captives . 
as he arrived , a top Bolivian official said his government might consider easing prison terms for Peruvian Marxist rebels held in jails as a way to help win the release of the lone Bolivian hostage in the 108-day siege at the Japanese ambassador &apos;s home in Lima . 
but Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada said his government could not bow to demands by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) for outright freedom for four MRTA rebels jailed in Bolivia , echoing Fujimori &apos;s own stand on the 450 MRTA prisoners in Peruvian jails . 
&quot; We are barred by law from freeing people who are subject to the judiciary , &quot; Sanchez de Lozada said after Fujimori arrived in the humid city in the Amazon lowlands . 
&quot; We will listen to what President Fujimori has to say , &quot; Sanchez de Lozada told reporters . 
Fujimori , making his fourth trip outside Peru since the MRTA rebels stormed a cocktail party and took the guests hostage on Dec . 17 , 1996 , looked relaxed and was dressed in a sports jacket as he arrived in Santa Cruz . 
he had no comment for journalists before going straight into talks and later dinner with Sanchez de Lozada . 
talks in Lima have stalled on MRTA demands for freedom for about 450 jailed comrades , including leader Victor Polay in exchange for release of their hostages . 
&quot; They are discussing very delicate issues , &quot; said Bolivia &apos;s information minister , Mauricio Antezana . 
Antezana said Bolivia might be willing to relax prison terms for MRTA convicts to win the release of Bolivian ambassador to Peru , Jorge Gumucio , one of the 72 hostages holed up in the residence . 
&quot; We don &apos;t have an official petition in that regard from the MRTA , but if that were the case , the government would consider it , &quot; Antezana told reporters . 
Fujimori aides who asked not to be identified dismissed speculation that the Peruvian leader had plans to discuss with Sanchez de Lozada either a release of prisioners or a lessening of sentences for jailed MRTA rebels . 
&quot; The only request I will make is that everything that is humanly possible be made in order to find a peaceful solution , although I expect him ( Fujimori ) to keep telling me to be patient and keep up the spirit , &quot; said Sanchez de Lozada . 
the two leaders will also discuss an upcoming Andean summit in Sucre , Bolivia , at the end of the month and will visit the drug-producing Chapare area on Saturday , Antezana said . 
in Peru , mediator and Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani visited a naval base in the port of Callao where Polay and a few other MRTA leaders are imprisoned . 
the visit led to speculation that Cipriani , facing a deadlock in talks to end the siege , was talking directly to the MRTA leadership . 
there was no sign that talks with MRTA by Cipriani and two other mediators , Canadian ambassador Anthony Vincent and Red Cross representative Michel Minnig , were making any headway . 
Canada &apos;s Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said on Friday he saw no early solution to the standoff , but underscored his government &apos;s willingness to help resolve the crisis . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see any breakthrough , &quot; Lloyd said in Tokyo , where he was completing a 24-hour visit . 
&quot; There is no magic answer . 
a secret intelligence report obtained by Reuters said new information suggested Congress President Victor Joy Way , two legislators and five mayors -- all harsh critics of the MRTA -- might be targeted for attacks by rebel commandos . 
joy Way was expected to fly to Tokyo this month for hostage crisis talks with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto . 
the health of a few of the hostages was reported to be deteriorating . 
all of them were men , mostly in their 40s and 50s , and some suffered from hypertension , diabetes and other chronic diseases , as well as stress-related disorders . 
there was concern about Gumucio &apos;s health after he was reported to have had an argument with one of the captors , which ended with the captor threatening Gumucio with a gun . 
Antezana said Gumucio was in good health and his mood was &quot; reasonably good .
