Bulgaria &apos;s Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) fell a real 11.7 percent in the first quarter of 1997 compared to the same period of last year , the National Statistics Institute ( NSI ) said on Thursday . 
&quot; GDP fell by a real 11.7 percent in the first quarter to 2,182 billion levs at current prices due to the slump of the Bulgarian economy in 1996 , &quot; the NSI said in a statement . 
GDP fell a real 3.5 percent year on year in the first quarter of last year and dropped a real 10.9 percent for the whole of 1996 to 1,660.2 billion levs , NSI figures showed . 
further details were not immediately available . 
the Lev fall in 1996 , shrinking demand and soaring inflation due to mismanagement by the former Socialist government and delayed structural reform have laid an extremely negative basis for economic development this year , the NSI said . 
a fall in GDP by a real 7.4 percent from 1996 to 16,150 billion levs at current prices was assumed in this year &apos;s budget due to be passed by parliament by end-June . 
business managers polled by the NSI expected a rise in economic activity in 1997 but said economic recovery would be accompanied by growth in unemployment . 
introduction of a restrictive fixed exchange rate mechanism called a currency board system from July 1 and speeding up of privatisation were expected to stabilise the economy . 
the currency board system envisages a fixed exchange rate of 1,000 levs to the German mark and requires that levs in circulation be matched by Bulgaria &apos;s foreign exchange reserves . 
Prime Minister Ivan Kostov said last week that this year &apos;s budget for the first time in seven years offered businesses in the country sufficient stability to plan their costs and investment for the long term .
