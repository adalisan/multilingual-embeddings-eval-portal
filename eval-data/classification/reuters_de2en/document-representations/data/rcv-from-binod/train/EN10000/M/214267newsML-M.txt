oil traders reacted with caution Monday to news that Iraq had agreed to all U.N. conditions in an oil-for-food deal and the prospect that Iraqi crude oil could start flowing as early next month . 
oil initially lost 50 cents to $ 23.25 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange following a statement by Iraqi U.N. 
Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon that Baghdad had agreed on a deal that would allow the sale of $ 2 billion of Iraqi oil over six months . 
the market later cut the loss , and the January crude oil contract closed down 26 cents at $ 23.49 as traders sensed that the extra oil from Iraq is likely to be absorbed by a hungry winter oil market . 
December heating oil ended down 0.56 cent at 72.23 cents a gallon , while December unleaded gasoline edged up 0.19 cent at 67.99 cents a gallon . 
the final green light for 800,000 barrels a day of Iraqi oil in exchange for badly needed food and medicines , which was agreed to on May 20 , remains in the hands of U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the powerful U.N. Sanctions Committee . 
one of the issues that has been holding up the agreement has been Iraqi insistence on controlling the number , make-up and freedom of movement of a U.N. team to observe its implementation on the ground . 
&quot; All the aspects of the MOU ( memorandum of agreement ) have been discussed and they have been agreed upon , &quot; said Hamdoon , adding that this included the issue of U.N. observers . 
he also said a pipeline leading from northern Iraq to Turkey , through which the bulk of the oil is to pass , &quot; will definitely be ready by the first week of December . 
analysts said they did not expect the market to react too dramatically to the news , until at least the first Iraqi oil is on the water . 
&quot; The market is hungry for barrels right now , &quot; said Peter Gignoux , head of the energy desk for Smith Barney in London . 
&quot; I think for the time being we are in a world of status quo and I don &apos;t think prices are going to react sharply one way or another . 
Peter Bogin of Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris said traders had already been burned when the deal was shelved in September after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent troops into northern Iraq to intervene in factional Kurdish fighting . 
&quot; Traders are saying that when the oil starts flowing or is on a ship , then they will believe it , &quot; he said . 
but Bob Finch , head trader at Vitol SA , the world &apos;s biggest independent trading and refining company , said he believed the market could easily soak up the extra oil . 
&quot; The market is strong irrespective of Iraq . 
spot market demand for winter fuels in the West is strong and stocks at refineries are low , &quot; he said . 
the breakthrough in the Iraq-UN talks took place against backdrop of this week &apos;s meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum exporting Countries . 
OPEC ministers converged on Vienna for talks expected to freeze current output quotas to try to extend this year &apos;s jump in oil prices . 
delegates at the meeting that formally starts Wednesday are already predicting a consensus on extending existing quotas to mid-1997 . 
OPEC Secretary-General Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria expressed satisfaction at the recent rally that has already lifted prices to their highest levels since the 1991 Gulf War . 
prices are averaging almost $ 20 per barrel so far this year and up $ 3 from 1995 . 
&quot; It &apos;s cold but I hope it gets colder , &quot; Lukman told reporters , observing that an early winter in the United States and Europe is firing up demand for fuel . 
one reason for the tighter market has been a delay in implementing the Iraq-U.N. accord . 
although the oil-for-food deal was set to go into force in September , it was delayed after Iraq sent its troops into the north of the country in late August to back one side in an inter-Kurdish conflict .
