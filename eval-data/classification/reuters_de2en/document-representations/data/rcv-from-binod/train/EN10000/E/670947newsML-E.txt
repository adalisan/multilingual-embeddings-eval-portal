note - dollar figures are billions . 
other figures are percentage changes . 
a Reuters survey of economists had forecast a 1.2 percent month-on-month rise in April . 
the increase in wholesale trade in April is in line with the strong sales recorded in the first two months of 1997 and a reversal of temporary setback recorded in March , Statistics Canada said . 
March wholesale trade fell 2.7 percent on the month . 
wholesalers reported higher sales in April for most sectors , except for computers and packaged software , which fell 5.8 percent , other products , down 0.7 percent , and food products , down 0.4 percent , StatsCan said . 
the federal agency said that in terms of dollars , sales increases in motor vehicles and parts ( up C $ 290 million ) and industrial machinery and equipment ( up C $ 176 million ) accounted for more than two-thirds of April &apos;s increase . 
motor vehicle sales have risen mainly because of renewed consumer confidence and lower interest rates , while industrial machinery sales were up because of increased activity in the non-residential sector , StatsCan said . 
declines in sales of computers and packaged software in the past two months may reflect some supply problems of key components , the agency said . 
inventories were up in April , rising 0.6 percent following a slight drop in March , down 0.2 percent . 
StatsCan said wholesalers are built up stocks in April to met strong demand . 
the inventory to sales ratio fell to 1.42 in April from 1.46 in March , StatsCan said . 
the 1.42 ratio for the months of April and February 1997 is the lowest since December 1994 . 
the agency said the ratio has been volatile in the last few months , reflecting the difficulty wholesalers have in controling inventory levels when sales are fluctuating .
