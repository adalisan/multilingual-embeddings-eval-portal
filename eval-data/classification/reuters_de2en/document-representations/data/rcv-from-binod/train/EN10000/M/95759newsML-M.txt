most U.S. spot products edged lower with futures on Friday after giving up early moderate gains , but vigorous exports to Europe helped Gulf distillates hold their own , players said . 
colder weather in the Northeast had pushed prods moderately higher in the morning , but prices retreated amid profit taking in the futures market , traders said . 
European traders said Friday as many as four million barrels of U.S. distillates had been fixed to sail to Europe in October to meet the continent &apos;s keen demand for 0.2 and 0.05 percent sulfur grades . 
U.S. Gulf Coast traders said the export activity had enlivened their market the past few days , helping to firm differentials on low sulfur diesel 0.20 cent Friday to about 1.10 cents below the November print . 
&quot; It looks like eight or ten cargoes will be moving to Europe the first half of October , &quot; one Gulf trader said , adding more were likely to follow . 
&quot; The exports are going to cut into our own stocks , &quot; another Gulf trader said , noting U.S. distillate levels were the lowest in a generation and likely to keep upward pressure on U.S. prices as colder weather sets in .
