the ringgit weakened in late Asian trading on Thursday on selling pressure triggered by rumours the governor of central Bank Negara Malaysia has resigned , dealers said . 
a Bank Negara spokesman denied that Ahmad Mohamed Don has stepped down . 
&quot; The rumour originated out of London . 
it prompted ringgit selling from offshore as well as local players , &quot; said a European bank dealer in Singapore . 
&quot; The selling was not very large but given the thin market volumes , it was enough to push the ringgit down more than 100 points , &quot; he said . 
at 1000 GMT , the ringgit was at 2.6455 / 85 to a dollar after hitting a low of 2.6490 . 
it closed at 2.6350 / 80 in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday . 
dealers said given the weak ringgit sentiment , the dollar was likely to test its recent high of 2.6530 . 
breaking this level could take dollar / ringgit to as high as 2.70 , they said . 
&quot; London may try to push it above 2.6530 tonight , &quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank . 
&quot; We are still looking at a weaker ringgit . 
sentiment is bearish at the moment . 
the stock market is weak and we just had a very large trade deficit for June .
