IPE Brent crude and gas oil futures continued climbing after the NYMEX open , extending earlier gains on forecasts of cold weather in Europe and the United States , brokers said . 
January Brent stood 30 cents up at $ 22.82 per barrel at 1554 GMT while January gas oil gained $ 6.75 to $ 212.00 per tonne . 
&quot; Gas oil got a boost from heat going over 70 cents , but this market is still treacherous , &quot; said Charles Gray of prudential Bache futures in London . 
private forecasters WSC said western European temperatures would continue well below average for the time of year . 
Gray said heavy oil price falls earlier this week had prompted increased domestic and retail buying of heating oil in Europe . 
he added that prices may have fallen too far , given that winter was only just starting . 
volume was slightly below average , brokers said , and many kept their eye on NYMEX December crude options expiry on Friday . 
they said the market should settle near $ 24.00 evens .
