Australian bond yields were only marginally higher in the face of a weakening U.S. Treasury market and another slump in neighbouring New Zealand debt ahead Wednesday &apos;s second quarter inflation data . 
the local market has priced in an extremely benign inflation outcome , so there is the risk of a &apos; buy the rumour , sell the fact &apos; scenario , but even so , there is a strong belief that it will lead to the Reserve Bank easing policy again . 
&quot; As long as wages are okay ( Thursday ) , we will be looking for a rate cut Friday , &quot; one bond trader said . 
median forecasts centre on a 0.1 percent quarterly fall in the headline CPI for a year-on-year rate of just 0.5 percent , and an underlying rate of 0.4 percent for an annual rate of 1.7 percent , below the RBA &apos;s 2.0-3.0 percent target . 
however , such are the market &apos;s expectations for inflation it may need outcomes at the low end of forecasts to spur on any further significant rally in the market , traders said . 
ranges for quarterly inflation in a recent Reuters survey of economists were plus 0.3 to minus 0.3 percent for the headline rate and plus 0.2 to 0.6 percent for the underlying . 
the bond futures market is very close to all-time-highs after rallying since April , so the market is going into the data very much on the long side , traders said . 
one hurdle the market must overcome before the data is the reaction to the first leg of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony later on Tuesday in the U.S. at 1800 GMT ( 0400 a.m. eastern Australia ) . 
&quot; ( But ) Greenspan could actually do us a favour if he is as negative as people expect him to be , in that it will give us more room to manoeuvre and give a bigger reaction to our data if we go into it offered , &quot; one bond trader said . 
such is the expectation for the inflation data that two reasonably negative surveys for the bond market by independent banks failed to daunt the market . 
HSBC chief economist John Edwards said that his bank &apos;s wages report , which showed enterprise bargaining agreements running at 4.9 percent in the June quarter , should not prevent a rate cut , although it may cause the RBA concern further down the track . 
likewise , Westpac &apos;s chief economist Nigel Stapledon said there is still ample slack in the economy for an easing , despite his bank &apos;s leading index in May showing annual growth at 8.2 percent , which is indicating growth picking up into 1998 . 
the 10-year spread differential to the U.S. is expected to test support at 25 basis points on the inflation forecast . 
on the day spreads were little changed within the dollar bloc , although New Zealand debt blew out sharply as the market adjusted to another slump in the N.Z. 
dollar . 
support at 93.360 remains unscathed on the 10-year bond contract , risking a test of last week &apos;s 3-1 / 2 year high of 93.510 , en route to the all-time-high of 93.630 set in early 1994 .
