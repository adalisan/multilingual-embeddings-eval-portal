U.S. Plains feedlot cattle bids near midday on Monday were light at $ 65.00 per cwt and passed by owners pricing cattle $ 67.00- $ 68.00 , feedlot sources said . 
&quot; packers are telling us they have plenty of cattle and are not in any hurry to buy for awhile , &quot; a Kansas feedlot manager said . 
sales were seen taking place Wednesday or Thursday . 
active sales last week and increased availability of contract and formulated cattle when calendar pages flipped to a new month on Friday kept buying interest light , several sources said . 
cattle owners anticipated fed cattle prices to be underpinned by outlooks for smaller showlists this week and recent firm beef prices , cattle feeders said . 
however , early estimates pegged showlists steady to slightly smaller than a week ago and beef prices appeared to be near a top after last week &apos;s climb , they said . 
Heavier-weight choice was quoted down $ 0.01 at $ 108.86 after jumping $ 4.10 per cwt higher last week . 
&quot; There &apos;s a little concern that the meat business could be slowing because of the higher money , &quot; a market source said .
