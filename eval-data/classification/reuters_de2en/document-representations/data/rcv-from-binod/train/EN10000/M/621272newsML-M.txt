copper ticked up towards recent highs on Wednesday morning , but the buying was thin and the market was unsure whether stronger levels could be sustained . 
three months copper climbed to $ 2,524 per tonne , up $ 17 from Tuesday &apos;s afternoon kerb close . 
U.S. commission or investment houses were reckoned to be behind the buying , traders said . 
&quot; I think they were playing with it , trying for the $ 2,525 / 30 resistance . 
it was marked up more than traded in volume , &quot; one said . 
the potential for higher numbers was there , if the $ 2,530 high hit last Thursday was surmounted , but one trader said he had selling on his books around that number . 
if the market fails to reach the recent high and stalls , it was vulnerable to lower numbers . 
the speculative community may throw up their hands and sell it off if prices break $ 2,500 , traders said . 
support was seen at $ 2,495 , then $ 2,480 and $ 2,440 / 50 . 
aluminium shrugged off a 5,775-tonne fall in LME inventories , after a spike to $ 1,658 on Tuesday failed to stimulate follow-through buying . 
prices were last at $ 1,633 , down $ 3 from Tuesday &apos;s kerb close . 
after the disappointing close , the market might want to take another look at the downside , including the $ 1,610 low seen on Friday , analysts said . 
nickel recovered from Tuesday &apos;s dive to $ 7,300 after news emerged of an illegal strike at South Africa &apos;s Rustenburg platinum mine , which also produces nickel . 
the market gained $ 69 to $ 7,370 , but it was still seen as vulnerable to further losses after breaking below its trendline . 
support was pegged at $ 7,230 and $ 7,110 , the April low . 
zinc edged slightly lower after a sizeable stocks fall of 6,250 tonnes , shedding $ 5 to $ 1,355 . 
large tonnages departed European warehouses , but nearly 3,000 tonnes arrived in the Singapore facility . 
the decline was not regarded as bullish since the European metal was expected to move into U.S. warehouses ahead of new rules requiring more paperwork next month , traders said . 
on the other hand , the deliveries into Singapore was seen as the start of a long-awaited influx of Chinese material into that facility . 
the other metals were sluggish and locked in ranges . 
lead was down $ 4 at $ 630 , tin slipped $ 5 to $ 5,725 and alloy was indicated at $ 1,492 / 97 , down $ 2 .
