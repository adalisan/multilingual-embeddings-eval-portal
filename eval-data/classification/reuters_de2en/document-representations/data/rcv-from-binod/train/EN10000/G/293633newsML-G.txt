King Hussein of Jordan said on Wednesday that Israel must honour the next deadline for handing over parts of the occupied West Bank to Palestinian administration . 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , speaking at a joint news conference , said accepting Israeli changes to the timetable was up to the Palestinians but warned that Syria would not rejoin negotiations if Israel broke its promises . 
Mubarak and King Hussein spoke in the south Egyptian winter resort of Aswan after an 80-minute meeting at a tourist hotel on an island in the Nile . 
King Hussein sought the meeting to discuss Jordan &apos;s role in Middle East peace talks , in which Egypt acts as informal patron to Palestinian negotiators , diplomatic sources said . 
the king , asked about Israel &apos;s request to delay the next stage of its troop redeployment in the West Bank until 1999 , said : &quot; Binding deadlines must be observed . 
an agreement since by Israel more than a year ago says that after handing over most of the West Bank town of Hebron -- still not carried out -- the next Israeli redeployment , mostly from rural areas , should be complete by this September . 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now wants to link the handover to talks due to be completed by May 1999 on the future of the 130,000 Jewish settlers in Gaza and the West Bank . 
that has thrown a new complication into Israeli-Palestinian talks on Israel &apos;s long-overdue withdrawal from most of Hebron , which have dragged on for months without conclusion . 
Mubarak , under fire from Israelis for his influence over the Palestinian negotiators , said accepting a new deadline was a Palestinian decision but warned of the consequences of Israel &apos;s action . 
&quot; If the Palestinians agree to delay it until a fixed deadline , that &apos;s their business , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But if the parties don &apos;t have confidence that Israel is respecting what has been agreed , then I say to them that it will mess things up and Syria won &apos;t be happy to join in ( negotiations ) as long as there &apos;s no confidence even in the agreements signed ... 
this is the problem , &quot; he added . 
&quot; We &apos;re interested in just and comprehensive peace but if the peace isn &apos;t comprehensive and just , I fear the consequences . 
Syria has held no talks with Israel since Netanyahu &apos;s right-wing government took office in June . 
it says talks must resume from the point where the previous government left them . 
asked if tensions between Israel and its Arab neighbours could lead to war , King Hussein said : &quot; We feel extremely concerned if the situation doesn &apos;t evolve into peace , which is what we hope for . 
Mubarak said : &quot; forget war . 
I don &apos;t think the peoples in the region are thinking of war . 
the Egyptian and Jordanian leaders both criticised Netanyahu &apos;s attempts to exclude Jerusalem from negotiations despite earlier agreement that the city is on the agenda for final status talks . 
&quot; There can be no peace unless the full right of the Arab Palestinian people in Jerusalem is recognised , &quot; said King Hussein . 
&quot; It would mean it ( the peace process ) is finished and we have to start from scratch , &quot; added Mubarak . 
&quot; When you say no dialogue on Jerusalem , you shut the doors to hope .
