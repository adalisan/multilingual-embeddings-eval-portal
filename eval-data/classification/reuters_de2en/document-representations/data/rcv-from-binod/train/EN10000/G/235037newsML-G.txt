Israel &apos;s parliament gave preliminary approval on Wednesday to a bill requiring foreign countries to move their embassies from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem despite international opposition . 
only 13 of the Knesset &apos;s 120 members voted on the bill , presented for the first of three readings by lawmaker Rehavam Zeevi of the far-right Moledet party . 
the bill , which passed eight to five , aims to force countries to recognise Israel &apos;s annexation of Arab East Jerusalem , occupied in the 1967 Middle East war . 
the bill now goes to committee . 
foreign Minister David Levy , who replied to the motion on behalf of the government , said the bill was &quot; just &quot; but expressed opposition , saying it could not be enforced . 
&quot; There is no place in the world where someone will determine where your capital is located , &quot; Levy said . 
&quot; The necessary question is in the reality ... We will not be able to enforce it ... What kind of sanctions could Israel apply ? 
only two countries -- Costa Rica and El Salvador -- have embassies in Jerusalem . 
other countries maintain embassies in Tel Aviv as a sign of their opposition to Israel &apos;s annexation of East Jerusalem . 
under a 1993 Israeli-PLO accord that launched limited Palestinian self-rule in parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip , the future of East Jerusalem is due to be decided during talks on a permanent peace settlement . 
the PLO wants East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future Palestinian state .
