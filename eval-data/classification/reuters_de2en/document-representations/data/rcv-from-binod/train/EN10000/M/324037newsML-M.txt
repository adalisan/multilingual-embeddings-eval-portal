Hungarian overnight rates ended higher after a session of tight liquidity , dealers said . 
overnight rates finished at 27.5 / 28 percent , up from Tuesday &apos;s close of 26.50 percent . 
&quot; Banks were taking money up at levels above the repo rates , &quot; said Pal Szucs of Hypo-Bank Hungaria . 
&quot; There &apos;s a huge lack of liquidity as everybody is seeking money , &quot; he said , adding that deals were struck mostly on the offer levels . 
the central bank &apos;s overnight and one-week repo rates are equally 27.75 percent . 
reasons behind the thin money supply included banks &apos; speculation in reverse repo deals which resulted in sources landing at the central bank , dealers said . 
others reasons maybe that one of the big banks &quot; sat &quot; on the money supply while it was also possible that banks had bought long-term government securities on expectations of long-term interest rates falling , thereby allowing them to lock in profits , Szucs said .
