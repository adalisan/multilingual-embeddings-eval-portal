lower oil imports and improvements in business with China and Japan kept the U.S. trade deficit from growing as sharply as anticipated in November , the Commerce Department said Friday . 
the gap between exports and imports increased 4.9 percent to $ 8.4 billion from a revised $ 8.01 billion in October -- well below the $ 9.8 billion shortfall forecast by Wall Street economists . 
total November exports rose 0.3 percent to a record $ 71.97 billion while imports increased 0.8 percent to $ 80.37 billion . 
previously , the department said the total October trade deficit was $ 7.99 billion , but it revbised that up slightly . 
&quot; It was substantially better than expected , &quot; said Charles Lieberman , managing director and director of financial markets research at Chase Securities Inc . &quot; There was only a slight deterioration in November after the enormous improvement in the trade account in October . 
there were dramatic improvements during November in chronic monthly deficits with Asian trade giants Japan and China . 
the deficit with China plunged 38.8 percent to $ 3 billion in November -- the first monthly decline in seven months -- while the shortfall with Japan shrank 12.9 percent to $ 4.32 billion . 
it was the smallest monthly deficit with China since April , when the gap was $ 2.3 billion . 
the department said the cumulative deficit of $ 43.4 billion in trade with Japan for the first 11 months of 1996 was the lowest for that period since 1991 . 
the smaller China deficit apparently reflected the fact that merchants already had stocked up for Christmas , as imports of toys and clothing were down sharply from October . 
but exports to China also were at record levels , with the biggest gains in sales of soybeans and electrical machinery . 
imports of foreign oil dropped sharply in November , possibly reflecting completion of a buildup in winter heating-oil inventories . 
crude petroleum imports declined to $ 4.11 billion from $ 4.81 billion in October , although the price per barrel was up to $ 21.44 from $ 21.38 . 
as a result , the U.S. deficit with oil-producing OPEC nations plunged 27 percent to $ 1.47 billion in November from $ 2 billion in October . 
the United States typically runs a surplus on its trade with other countries in services like travel and tourism that partly offsets big merchandise trade deficits . 
in November , the merchandise deficit rose to $ 14.7 billion from $ 14.1 billion in October . 
the surplus on services increased to $ 6.3 billion from $ 6.1 billion in October . 
the main contributor to the overall rise in November imports was the resumption of stronger volumes of Canadian-made cars and parts . 
imports were curbed in October by a strike against General Motors Corp. plants in Canada , but once it was settled , the normal flow of car imports resumed in November . 
on the export side , foreign sales of civilian aircraft fell sharply in November , by $ 366 million to $ 1.39 billion from $ 1.75 billion in October . 
before the report was released , analysts said a strong dollar that made U.S. exports more expensive for foreigners , together with economic weakness among key trade partners in Europe and Japan , was likely to make it hard to shrink the U.S. monthly deficit in 1997 . 
&quot; With the combination of three things : slow growth overseas , a strong dollar , then U.S. economic growth picking up steam , I think we will see probably the trade deficit deteriorating , &quot; said economist Sung won Sohn of Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis . 
during November , the deficit on trade with Western Europe fell 24 percent to $ 1.38 billion from $ 1.82 billion in October . 
but the gap with Canada grew 34 percent to $ 1.89 billion from $ 1.41 billion in October and the deficit with Mexico was up 38.8 percent to $ 1.52 billion in November .
