U.S. golfer John Daly has entered the Betty Ford Centre in another attempt to overcome his battle with alcoholism , he said in a statement issued by the American PGA Tour on Sunday . 
it is the second time Daly , the big-hitting 1991 PGA Champion and 1995 British Open champion , has undergone alcohol rehabilitation . 
in 1993 he was treated for two weeks at Sierra Tucson Rehabilitation Facility in Arizona . 
Daly withdrew from this week &apos;s Players Championship in Ponte Vedra Beach , Florida , after shooting a 76 on Thursday , saying he had a sore hip . 
after the round Daly was reportedly seen drinking well into Friday morning at sloppy Joe &apos;s , a Jacksonville Beach bar , dancing , jamming with the band , and drinking with a couple of members of the Jacksonville Jaguars NFL team . 
the PGA Tour released a statement from Daly which read : &quot; As part of my ongoing battle to overcome alcoholism , I have decided to immediately enter the Betty Ford Alcohol Rehabilitation Programme . 
&quot; In August of 1996 , I suffered a setback in dealing with my disease . 
&quot; I &apos;ve come to realise this terrible disease is much tougher than I thought and have decided , with the support of my family and friends , to let others help me . 
I apologise to others who struggle with me in fighting this disease . 
I am going to do my best , and hopefully we will prevail together . 
at the end of 1992 Daly was suspended from the tour by then-commissioner Deane Beman after he was arrested for assaulting his then-wife Bettye Fulford . 
soon afterward Daly entered alcohol rehabilitation . 
although he stopped drinking he was suspended again at the end of 1993 after he withdrew from the Kapalua International . 
he voluntarily removed himself from the PGA Tour in September 1994 after he got into a scuffle with the 62-year-old father of one of his fellow competitors at the &apos; 94 World Series of Golf . 
in between all the trouble , Daly has won four times , two of the wins , including the British Open , while sober . 
he took his first drink since January 1993 the week after last year &apos;s British Open . 
PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem also issued a statement on Sunday , saying : &quot; It is an important step for John to continue to recognise and acknowledge his disease and his relapse . 
&quot; We fully support his decision to enter the Betty Ford programme , and we admire his courage in taking the action he has to find the best professional help he can .
