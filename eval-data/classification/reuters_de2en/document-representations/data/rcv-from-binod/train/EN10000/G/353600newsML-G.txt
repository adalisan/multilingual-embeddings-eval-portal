Central African Republic &apos;s outgoing Prime Minister Jean-Paul Ngoumpande said on Tuesday he had been prevented from leaving the country to return to France and see his family . 
President Ange-Felix Patasse named outgoing foreign minister Michel Gbezzera-Bria on January 30 to head a government action for the defence of democracy -- part of a peace deal brokered by African mediators to end the third army mutiny in under a year . 
Ngoumpande , who took office in June 1996 , told Radio France International he wanted to return to Paris to see his family for the first time in eight months after formally stepping down on Monday . 
&quot; My collaborators were carrying out the formalities at the airport when they were told that I could not move , I could not leave the country , &quot; he said . 
I would like to think it is a misunderstanding , &quot; he added . 
the revolts -- in April and May and latterly from November to January -- began over pay but escalated into an attempt to oust Patasse . 
French troops intervened to keep rival army factions apart .
