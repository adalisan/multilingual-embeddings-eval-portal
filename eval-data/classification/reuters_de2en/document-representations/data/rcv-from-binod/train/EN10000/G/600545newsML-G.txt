judging from its first edition in a brave new format , the television ratings of that heady British cocktail of comedy , farce and politics -- Prime Minister &apos;s Question Time -- may be about to plummet . 
the programme , off the air for the past few weeks while its cast reauditioned for the best parts -- the general election came and went on May 1 -- returned on Wednesday , but was a pale shadow of its former self . 
John Major , who has replaced Tony Blair as leader of the opposition , failed somehow to carry off the role with the pugnacity of his predecessor . 
&quot; There was not much fire power , &quot; one of Blair &apos;s aides remarked . 
Blair , who has taken Major &apos;s old role of prime minister , was sober and serious , but his performance was scarcely riveting . 
in the words of Paddy Ashdown , whose role as leader of the minority Liberal Democrats has been enhanced during the break by a doubling of his supporters , the affair has become &quot; a little less confrontational and a little more rational &quot; . 
it is Blair , whose Labour Party won Britain &apos;s election by a landslide who has forced changes to &quot; PMQs &quot; , as it is known to afficionados who watch on cable television in the United States or Sky television in Britain and elsewhere . 
instead of a 15-minute slot each Tuesday and Thursday , there is now a half-hour jumbo edition on Wednesdays . 
in theory the action has been speeded up . 
the Prime Minister no longer repeats the mantra : &quot; I refer the honourable member to the answer I gave some moments ago &quot; every few minutes after being asked once again about his activities earlier in the day . 
the Blair changes are designed to give PMQs extra gravitas . 
&quot; While it may make for less effective TV , it must make for more effective questioning of the executive , &quot; the Blair aide said . 
in any case , during the break in which Britain &apos;s election took place , the entire atmosphere surrounding has changed . 
the female interest used to be provided almost solely by Betty Boothroyd , a former leg-kicking formation dancer , who in her more mature years has taken the equally demanding role of parliamentary Speaker . 
now far more members of the supporting cast , especially among those who cheer Blair on , are women -- more than a quarter of the 418 Labour MPs . 
their presence , by general assent , inhibits the grosser sorts of insults . 
indeed the best jokes of this new edition were about the change of format . 
Conservative Ian Taylor welcomed Blair to his new role of answering questions rather than posing them and added sarcastically : &quot; I am most grateful to him for finding time in his diary to do so .
