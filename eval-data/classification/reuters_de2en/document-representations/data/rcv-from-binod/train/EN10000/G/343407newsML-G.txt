Hutu extremists killed some 20 Tutsi civilians and wounded at least nine in a village in northwestern Rwanda at the weekend , aid and hospital officials said on Thursday . 
they told Reuters that the Tutsi-dominated army killed an unknown number of Hutus in reprisal . 
&quot; It happened on the night of Saturday and Sunday . 
Hutu extremists came to Musanze and killed 20 people , &quot; said Andre Kabazyiza , a local employee of the International Committee of the Red Cross . 
&quot; Some of these people were thrown into the river that flows into Ruhengeri and six of these were recovered by local people , &quot; he said . 
&quot; On Sunday and Monday there was a reprisal operation by the security forces in which a large number of people were killed , &quot; he added . 
Veronique Babilihenga , an official at Ruhengeri hospital , said : &quot; We have had nine wounded brought into this hospital since the attack on Saturday night . 
Rwandan officials said troops killed some 80 people in a crackdown in the northeastern prefecture of Ruhengeri last week after suspected Hutu militiamen killed three Spanish aid workers of Medicos del Mundo ( Doctors of the World ) in their compound . 
in the same attack an American aid worker was shot in one of his legs which was amputated . 
the aid workers &apos; killings followed a series of attacks on survivors of the 1994 genocide and Hutu witnesses to the killings who had returned to Rwanda in November and December . 
it was the worst deliberate attack on foreigners in Rwanda since an estimated 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed by hardline Hutu militiamen and troops in 1994 .
