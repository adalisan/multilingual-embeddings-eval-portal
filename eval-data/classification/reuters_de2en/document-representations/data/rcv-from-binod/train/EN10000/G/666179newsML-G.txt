five leaders of Mali opposition parties , held on charges of inciting violence on June 7 , have been released on bail , they or their families said on Tuesday . 
the five are from parties that reject President Alpha Oumar Konare &apos;s May 11 election victory as rigged . 
they were also charged with refusing to recognise the authority of the state . 
&quot; In detention , we were quite clear , &quot; Mountaga tall of the National Congress for Democratic Initiative ( CNID ) , one of the five , told Radio France International . 
&quot; We do not recognise the May 11 election which was fraudulent . 
the others held were Almamy Sylla of the Rally for Democracy and Progress ( RDP ) , Sogal Maiga of the Patriotic Movement for Renewal ( MPR ) , Colonel Issouf Traore of the Union of Democratic and Popular Forces ( UFDP ) and youth leader Moussa Kone . 
the Monday night releases followed mediation from religious groups led by Bamako Archbishop Luc Sangare . 
the opposition leaders said dialogue was conditional on their release . 
Mali was widely praised for its 1992 transition from Moussa Traore &apos;s dictatorship to a multi-party system . 
the constitutional court ruled in April that numerous irregularities made an April 13 first round vote for the former French colony &apos;s 147-seat parliament flawed . 
main opposition parties , calling for the whole cycle of elections to be rerun , boycotted the May 11 presidential election . 
Konare won 84.36 percent of votes in the first round . 
the government had set the parliamentary first round rerun for July 6 . 
it has since put it back to July 20 .
