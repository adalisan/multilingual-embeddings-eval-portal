fresh South Korean supplies , high inventories and weak regional demand sent gasoline prices tumbling to a six-month low on Wednesday , industry sources said on Wednesday . 
a European major with a 50,000-barrel cargo of 95-octane unleaded gasoline lifting May 1-5 dropped the offer by 30 cents per barrel to $ 24.50 , the lowest level since early October . 
another European major offered the 97-octane at $ 24.90 , down from the $ 25.10 offer on Tuesday . 
South Korean refiner Ssangyong started exports , adding to an already oversupplied market . 
Ssangyong started up its new 40,000-barrel-per-day catalytic cracker early this month and has already sold two cargoes of 200,000-300,000 barrels and 100,000 barrels lifting April / early May , to respectively , U.S. refiner Coastal and European major BP . 
traders said the cargoes were sold on a mixture of gasoline and naphtha spot quotes on a fob Onsan , translating to &quot; flat landed in Singapore &quot; . 
official told Reuters there were no firm plans for may exports as its 150,000-bpd crude distillation unit shut between May 6-June 1 for turnaround . 
another South Korean refiner was heard to have sold an April-lifting cargo of 300,000-barrels to Saudi Aramco at around $ 3.00 per barrel over Singapore spot quotes , fob Yeochon . 
&quot; It is around the right level considering the naphtha / mogas spread , &quot; a trader said . 
traders said the spread , or the reforming margin , had weakened to $ 3.00- $ 3.50 per barrel , putting pressure once again on Singapore refiners to cut gasoline output . 
although bearish amid a lack of buyers , naphtha prices were only slightly softer . 
but the backwardation on paper disappeared with May swaps dropping 25 cents per barrel to $ 21.50 / $ 21.70 while June lost 5 cents to fall on par with May .
