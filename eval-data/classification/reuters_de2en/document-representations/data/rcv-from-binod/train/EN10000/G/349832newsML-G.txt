Nobel Peace Prize winner Jose Ramos-Horta leaves New Zealand on Monday and says he will not return while an &quot; utterly hypocritical &quot; government is in power . 
Ramos-Horta , a prominent spokesman for East Timorese independence , reacted with rage on Sunday when he saw a copy of a news release from Foreign Minister Don McKinnon summing up their half-hour talk on Friday , the New Zealand Press Association reported . 
McKinnon &apos;s statement included a reference to efforts to encourage &quot; reconciliation amongst the East Timorese factions &quot; . 
speaking in Christchurch , Ramos-Horta , who was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year , said it was a myth that East Timorese seeking freedom from Indonesia were divided . 
East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed a year later in a move never recognised by the United Nations . 
&quot; The root of the problem is the military occupation , annexation and gross and systematic abuse of the Timorese people , &quot; said Ramos-Horta . 
East Timorese resistance would have been crushed by the Indonesian military by now if the desire for independence was not widespread . 
he said he found it &quot; utterly hypocritical &quot; to read talk of Timorese factions after 21 years of occupation . 
&quot; If I keep reading this kind of communique , New Zealand should drop dead . 
he would ask Oxfam , who had organised his trip , to convey his outrage over the statement and his intention to continue to campaign for a referendum on East Timorese independence without the help of the New Zealand government .
