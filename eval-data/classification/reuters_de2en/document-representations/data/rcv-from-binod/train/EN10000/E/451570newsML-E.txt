China may lower interest rates slightly in 1997 to help to spur economic growth as inflation continues to fall , the Financial News said on Tuesday . 
Beijing would continue to maintain an &quot; appropriately &quot; tight monetary policy and inflation in 1997 was seen falling below last year &apos;s level , the newspaper said . 
but interest rates on treasury bond issues and interbank lending were too high and should be reduced , the newspaper said . 
it did not say by how much interest rates should be cut . 
Beijing cut interest rates last May and again in August to ease credit as inflation fell . 
the August cut trimmed bank deposit rates by an average of 1.5 percentage points and lending rates by 1.2 percentage points . 
China notched up economic growth of 10.2 percent last year and has set an official target of eight percent growth for this year . 
China &apos;s benchmark retail price index rose a year-on-year 2.9 percent in February , down from 3.3 percent in January . 
Beijing has forecast retail price inflation to come in under six percent this year . 
the index was 6.1 percent in 1996 , down from 14.8 percent in 1995 and a Communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994 .
