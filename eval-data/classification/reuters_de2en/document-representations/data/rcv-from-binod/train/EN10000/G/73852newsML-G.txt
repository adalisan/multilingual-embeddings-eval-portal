the French Riviera resort of Mandelieu has banned a billboard advertisement by the Italian clothes retailer Benetton featuring a black horse and a white horse mating , officials said on Tuesday . 
the Riviera town of Nice banned the poster last week . 
Henri Leroy , conservative mayor of Mandelieu outside Cannes , ordered the poster to be taken down as &quot; a threat to public morals &quot; . 
he said several people had complained about it . 
Nice &apos;s Gaullist mayor Jacques Peyrat said last Friday : &quot; The shocking and provocative presentation of coupling black and white horses is attempting to incite either racism or human behaviour that is contrary to our republican values . 
the billboard , the latest in a series of controversial advertising campaigns by Benetton , &quot; could also foster an unhealthy perception of mixed couples in our country , &quot; Peyrat said . 
the posters sparked a barrage of criticism when they first appeared in Belgium last month . 
the country &apos;s two largest billboard operators refused to put them up . 
Benetton &apos;s controversial advertising campaigns began in 1989 . 
previous posters have shown a white baby being breast-fed by a black woman , bodies stamped &quot; HIV positive &quot; and a nun and a priest kissing .
