Israeli troops shot and killed a man who infiltrated Israel from Jordan on Saturday , the Israeli army said . 
&quot; An unidentified man was shot and killed during the night near the eastern security fence of Kfar Rupin in the Jordan Valley after an infiltrator was located . 
an Israeli army force rushed to the location and shot at a suspicious figure , &quot; an army spokeswoman said . 
Kfar Rupin is an Israeli village just north of the border between Israel and the West Bank . 
&quot; It appears we are dealing with an unarmed man who tried to cross the fence . 
his body has not yet been identified , &quot; she said . 
the spokeswoman said the army scoured the area on Saturday morning for possible further infiltrators and that the incident was under investigation . 
&quot; The incident and investigation of its circumstances are being conducted in coordination with the Jordanian army , &quot; the spokeswoman said . 
anti-Israel guerrillas periodically attempt to cross from Jordan into Israel and the occupied West Bank , which Israel seized from Jordan in 1967 , to mount attacks . 
but Jordan , which cooperated quietly with Israel even when the two states were publicly enemies , has kept tight control of the Jordan Valley area since it signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state in 1994 .
