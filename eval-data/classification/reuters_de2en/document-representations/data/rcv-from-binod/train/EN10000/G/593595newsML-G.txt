Hong Kong &apos;s return to Chinese sovereignty could lay the groundwork for reunification with Taiwan , Chinese vice premier Zhu Rongji told Newsweek magazine in an interview released on Sunday . 
&quot; I firmly believe that the successful implementation of one country , two systems will surely contribute to reunification , &quot; Zhu said in an exclusive interview in the news magazine &apos;s latest edition , due out on Monday . 
&quot; Our terms for Taiwan &apos;s return to the motherland are more generous , &quot; Zhu said . 
&quot; We will not deploy troops or station troops on Taiwan , and Taiwan &apos;s leaders can come to be leaders in the central government . 
but as for when Taiwan will return to the motherland , it will be when forces in the U.S. no longer support an independent Taiwan . 
Communist-ruled China has regarded Taiwan as a rebel province since 1949 , when defeated Nationalist forces took refuge on the island after years of civil war . 
Beijing , which reserves the right to invade Taiwan if it ever declares formal independence , has repeatedly demanded the island &apos;s leaders accept the principle of &quot; One China &quot; and prove their intention to eventually reunify with the mainland . 
Zhu , the architect of China &apos;s economic reforms , reiterated Beijing &apos;s stance to its military option against Taiwan . 
while he maintains that &quot; it is our consistent policy that we will achieve reunification through peaceful means , &quot; he added &quot; we will not give up the military option . 
he said missile tests conducted by China off the coast of Taiwan last year were &quot; normal exercises &quot; and probably did not discourage Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui in his push for independence . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think he will really pull back when he can purchase and import advanced weapons from the U.S. at will , &quot; he added . 
in a wide-ranging interview with Newsweek editor Maynard Parker in Beijing , Zhu also said there would be minimal interference by China &apos;s central government in Hong Kong after the handover from Britain in July . 
&quot; Except for defense and foreign affairs , the central government of China won &apos;t interfere in Hong Kong &apos;s internal affairs and will pursue the policy of one country , two systems ... the facts will show that it will be successfully implemented , &quot; Zhu said . 
he added , however , that Hong Kong &apos;s current success and development was due not only to its political system . 
&quot; Hong Kong &apos;s success is mainly determined by Hong Kong &apos;s people . 
but without development in China , Hong Kong would not have enjoyed the level of development that it has today .
