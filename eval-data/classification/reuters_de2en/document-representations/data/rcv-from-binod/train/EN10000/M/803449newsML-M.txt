aluminium and zinc prices pushed higher during Friday LME pre-market trading , building on Thursday &apos;s advances , but the other markets , including copper , were fairly slow . 
zinc was helped by a sizeable stock fall and a widening backwardation , while aluminium ignored another inventory increase and continued to focus on prompt August date nearby tightness , traders said . 
&quot; zinc and aluminium are the lively ones at the moment , but copper has been slow for weeks now . 
but it is the summer , &quot; one trader noted . 
zinc stocks fell by 5,625 tonnes , and although there was a net increase in Singapore inventories , this was more than compensated by shipments elsewhere , principally Rotterdam . 
the cash / threes spread was also widening , standing at $ 138 / 45 , against $ 125 / 130 on Thursday . 
trade buying underpinned the forward market , which touched $ 1,542 before settling at $ 1,536 , up $ 17 a tonne from the overnight kerb close . 
aluminium stocks rose by 4,825 tonnes , the fourth day in a row , making a net rise this week of 9,875 tonnes . 
traders continued to attribute these increases to metal being attracted by the August backwardation . 
metal was delivered into Japan yesterday , while today &apos;s rise saw aluminium being warranted in the UK . 
prices picked up from an early low under $ 1,700 and traded up to $ 1,715 , a $ 14 advance . 
copper prices rallied up from an early low around $ 2,254 to $ 2,268 , down just $ 3 from Thursday . 
business was slow and the market now seemed to have formed a rough $ 2,250 / 2,300 range . 
cash / threes was holding at a $ 7 / 11 backwardation , but this spread premium may soften further as longs are rolled forward , traders said . 
nickel prices ranged either side of $ 6,700 but continued to enjoy corrective short covering . 
business was $ 5 lower at $ 6,710 . 
lead edged up to $ 614 , up $ 4 , continuing this week &apos;s rally from the $ 600 level . 
tin was steady at $ 5,420 / 40 a tonne , as was alloy at $ 1,520 / 30 .
