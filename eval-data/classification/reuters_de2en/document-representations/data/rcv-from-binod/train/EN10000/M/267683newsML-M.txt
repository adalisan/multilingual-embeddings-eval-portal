Indian higher-grade rice export prices rose by nearly $ 10 per tonne this week after good export demand from CIS ( Commonwealth of Independent States ) countries , traders said on Thursday . 
&quot; Good export demand from CIS countries pushed up five percent broken non-Basmati prices by nearly $ 10 per tonne , &quot; Prem Garg , managing director of Sri Lal Mahal Overseas Ltd , told Reuters . 
traders said India five percent broken non-Basmati was quoted at $ 310 per tonne fob , 10 percent at $ 290 , 15 percent at $ 255 and 25 percent at $ 235 per tonne . 
&quot; Sri Lanka is the major buyer right now , &quot; Garg said . 
he said two or three vessels of around 12,500 tonnes each were currently being loaded for shipments to Sri Lanka . 
traders said export prices of fine grade , aromatic Basmati rice had shot up this year due to a surge in demand from European countries and a fall in domestic arrivals . 
&quot; Basmati prices were ruling at least 25 percent higher compared to last year , &quot; Garg said . 
traders said Basmati was quoted at around $ 900 per tonne compared to about $ 700 at the same time last year . 
about 80 percent of the winter crop had been harvested , they said . 
India harvests two rice crops , getting the bulk of its output from the winter crop . 
the winter crop is sown during July and the harvest starts from October . 
the Agriculture Ministry expects India &apos;s winter rice output to be 71.27 million tonnes .
