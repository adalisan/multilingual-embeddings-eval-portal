Friday was a quiet day on the Botswana Stock Exchange -- as usual . 
with an average of just 12 trades a day there is plenty of time to mark price moves on the big white board in the offices of the only stockbroking firm , stockbrokers Botswana Ltd , which runs the market . 
Botswana &apos;s young bourse , which became a formal exchange last year after five years of informal dealings , is caught in a bind . 
&quot; Our investor base is our biggest problem -- we have just five domestic institutional investors , &quot; said stockbrokers Botswana chief executive Alan Norrie . 
individuals prefer to invest in cattle . 
in a bid to appeal more to the slim domestic audience of pension funds and insurers , the BSE is now changing tack , winning official approval last month for the dual listing of stocks in Gaborone which are already listed overseas . 
the first company to take advantage of the new rule is Regent undervalued Assets Africa Fund Ltd which will become the 13th company on the BSE when it lists simultaneously in Gaborone , Dublin and Nairobi on December 27 . 
for local institutions , dual listings offer the chance to hedge locally against the Pula which is unofficially pegged to the falling South African rand . 
but the move could limit the availability of genuine Botswanan stocks if firms like Barclays or Engen decide to delist their local units , dual listing the parent instead . 
and dual listing will not make life any easier for foreign funds looking for exposure to one of Africa &apos;s more successful economies . 
some 20 emerging market funds are currently invested in the BSE , notably via purchases of shares in brewery holding company Sechaba sold by the state Botswana Development Corp over the last two years . 
Norrie estimates foreign funds hold about 150 million Pula ( $ 41 million ) of BSE shares , or around 12 percent of the market &apos;s 1.2 billion Pula total capitalisation . 
by international standards Botswanan stocks are a bargain . 
the market trades on an average price / earnings ratio of 7.04 times -- half that of neighbouring South Africa -- and dividend yields of over 10 percent exceed bank deposit rates . 
furthermore , by emerging market standards , Botswana is a paragon of economic and political virtue : the government is stable , has virtually no debt and will be funded by revenues from the world &apos;s richest diamond mines well into next century . 
the problem is illiquidity and lack of investment targets . 
&quot; Botswana is not at the top of our list because the market is not liquid enough . 
it is very cheap , but there are not enough places to put our money , &quot; Templeton Asset Management emerging market head Mark Mobius said during a recent visit . 
full , or more likely partial , privatisation of state utilities such as Botswana Telecommunications Corp could provide a new supply of assets to the private sector . 
but while the government appears receptive to the idea , local businessmen say privatisation may take several years since the state is under no budgetary pressure to sell . 
in the meantime , the immediate headache for foreigner investors and local institutions -- who are allowed to take 65 percent of their assets offshore -- is the falling Pula . 
the government &apos;s decision to track the rand to keep industry competitive has dissipated the Pula &apos;s innate strength . 
in local currency terms , the Botswana share index has gained six percent this year , but in U.S. dollars it is back to where it was in June 1990 . 
( $ 1 = 3.66 Pula )
