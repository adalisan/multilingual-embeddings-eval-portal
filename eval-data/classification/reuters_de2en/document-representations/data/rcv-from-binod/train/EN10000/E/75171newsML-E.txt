Argentina &apos;s lower house of Congress Wednesday voted into law a bill letting the federal government keep all the revenues from a planned fuel tax hike . 
the bill was passed by 153 votes in favor and 53 against , while eight deputies did not vote . 
the law extends a previous deal with provincial governments and will allow the federal government to keep all of the extra $ 1.6 billion in additional fuel taxes . 
but the provinces will be guaranteed some $ 700 million from a tax on personal wealth . 
another law of great fiscal import was to be debated by the Senate later Wednesday -- a package of measures originally aimed at cutting the 1996 budget deficit by $ 1.6 billion to $ 5.0 billion . 
but the package has since been watered down at the committee stage and may now only have half that effect .
