Desmond Tutu , chairman of South Africa &apos;s truth commission , said on Monday that apartheid-era president P.W. 
Botha had agreed to meet him to discuss accusations that he ordered the bombing of a building used by black activists in the 1980s . 
Tutu , chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission probing human rights abuses committed under white rule , said Botha had sent him a letter accepting an invitation to a meeting . 
&quot; ( Botha ) has responded very warmly and positively to the letter I sent him last Thursday , &quot; Tutu told reporters in the Indian Ocean port city of Durban . 
&quot; We are going to be dealing with all the relevant issues , &quot; he said , adding he would raise the allegation by former police commissioner Johan van der Merwe that Botha had personally given the order for the 1988 bombing of Johannesburg &apos;s Khotso House . 
he declined to say when or where the meeting would occur . 
last week the commission said it would subpoena Botha if he refused to meet its officials to discuss allegations against him . 
however , Tutu said on Monday Botha &apos;s poor health and his position as a retired president had prompted the commission to approach Botha at his home in the Cape province . 
the commission has so far mainly heard testimony from victims of apartheid but the hearings over the past two weeks have initiated what could be flood of disclosures by perpetrators of abuses .
