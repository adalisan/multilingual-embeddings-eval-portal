* choppy stocks finish with light gains , futures dictate tone as traders wary of U.S. data . 
a choppy Australian share market wandered to a just firmer close on Thursday with futures trading dictating many of the day &apos;s gyrations . 
the All Ordinaries Index edged 3.8 points higher to 2,627.4 . 
September share price index futures contracts were down six points at 2,625 , a 2.4 point discount to the underlying index . 
&quot; The future players have had a big say in many of the moves today , &quot; said one Sydney broker , adding that most individual performances matched the broader market &apos;s little changed close . 
&quot; The rest of them were all a little mixed . 
others echoed similar sentiments , adding that caution appeared to have set in amidst the plethora of key U.S. economic data out this week . 
&quot; Some important economic data is leading the U.S. market this week , &quot; said Henderson Charlton Jones dealer Hamish Dee . 
&quot; Retail sales and PPI ( producer price index ) were out last night but the CPI ( consumer price index ) figure is out tonight and there is a fairly large emphasis being placed on that in the short term , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I think that &apos;s what has driven our market this afternoon -- a little bit of cautiousness heading into tonight . 
the big banks got an boost from a buoyant bond market , which strengthened after a surprisingly benign set of local second quarter wages data . 
however , trader wariness ahead of possible U.S. moves trimmed gains with all four big banks finishing well off their highs for the day . 
with patchy performances the general order of the day , the individual focus was on profit results with several impressive showing from industrial stocks . 
financial services and construction conglomerate lend lease Corporation ended 21 cents higher at A $ 28.97 after reporting a 15 percent higher year net profit of A $ 322 million and lift in final dividend to 50 cents a share . 
construction and contract mining group Leighton Holdings Ltd impressed many on the day with a special dividend of 10 cents a share , in addition to a final payout of 13 cents a share , made from a 32 percent higher year net profit of A $ 86.24 million . 
recently listed bancassurance group colonial Ltd closed over four percent higher at A $ 3.55 after its maiden half year net profit of A $ 118 million . 
however , Sydney Harbour casino ended down two cents after reporting a half year net loss of A $ 7.34 million . 
elsewhere , shares in ferry operator Holyman Ltd plunged 65 cents to end at a record low at A $ 1.70 as investors jumped ship after Wednesday &apos;s profit downgrade due to problems at its 67 percent owned Holyman Sally operations in Europe . 
rises shaded falls by just a whisker , while about 27 percent of stocks traded remained steady . 
futures business was active with a high 11,842 September SPI contracts traded underlining the influence of the market on the day . 
options traded was moderate with 30,417 traded . 
in other local markets , the Australian debt market saw its strongest performance for some weeks as thoughts once again turned to the possibility of another easing in monetary policy after the release of a benign set of final wages data . 
by 5.00 p.m. ( 0700 GMT ) , 10 year T-bonds were yielding 6.69 percent , down from 6.83 percent on Wednesday . 
the Australian dollar posted its first lower local close this week after selling from its morning highs was compounded by unexpected weakness in key wages data that left the door open for a sixth cut in interest rates .
