North Korea on Thursday slammed South Korean President Kim Young-sam &apos;s visit to Japan this weekend , questioning why Kim would visit Japan when his country was in a &quot; serious political and economic crisis &quot; . 
&quot; Why the traitor Kim Young-sam is going to visit Japan in the beginning of the year and at this time when the political situation of South Korea is totally paralysed draws international attention , &quot; North Korea &apos;s official Korea Central News Agency ( KCNA ) said in a report monitored in Tokyo . 
South Korea has been rocked by industrial strife since a controversial labour law was passed more than three weeks ago . 
Kim will spend two days from Saturday in the scenic hot-spring resort of Beppu in southern Japan to meet Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and other officials . 
&quot; He is in the most serious political and economic crisis in his term of office , &quot; KCNA quoted the spokesman for the Korean Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries as saying . 
&quot; It is obvious that during his overseas trip , Kim Young-sam , forsaken at home and abroad , will beg Japan to remain in the &apos; cooperation system &apos; against the DPRK ( North Korea ) and to refrain from humanitarian assistance to the DPRK , &quot; KCNA said .
