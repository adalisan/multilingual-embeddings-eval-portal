Brazil &apos;s National Monetary Council ( CMN ) Thursday set the so-called &quot; discount &quot; used for calculating the benchmark Reference Rate ( TR ) at 0.95 percent for next May , a Finance Ministry official said . 
Pedro Parente , the ministry &apos;s executive secretary , told reporters the discount in May would be unchanged from April . 
the discount is used to calculate the Reference Rate , which determines savings rates and mortgage rates . 
the TR is based on an average of a basket of certificates of Deposit ( CDs ) interest rates minus the discount . 
the discount for January has been set at 0.97 percent , for February at 0.96 percent and for March at 0.95 percent .
