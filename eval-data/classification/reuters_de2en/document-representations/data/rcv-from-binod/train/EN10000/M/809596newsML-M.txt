U.S. treasuries rose early in the session and never looked back , ending moderately higher on Monday , as the market was boosted by early deterioration in stock prices and a stronger dollar . 
&quot; The stock market was dictating a lot of flows , &quot; said one head trader at a European-based primary dealership . 
&quot; There was a lot of asset allocation ( from stocks to bonds ) going on . 
stock prices , which plunged on Friday , spent much of Monday &apos;s session weaker , with the Dow Jones industrial average down as much as 83 points in the afternoon . 
but stocks staged a furious late-day rally , with the Dow ending 80 points higher . 
yet the rise in stocks barely made a dent in Treasury prices . 
late Monday , the 30-year bond was at 98-3 / 32 , up 11 / 32 from Friday . 
it had been up as much as a half-point early in the afternoon . 
the bond &apos;s yield fell to 6.52 percent from 6.55 percent . 
last week , a falling dollar hurt treasuries . 
the dollar was at 117.95 yen and 1.8340 marks in late day trading , up from 117.90 yen and 1.8200 marks at the open . 
&quot; People are looking for direction , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; Watch stocks and watch the dollar and that will tell you what is going on . 
indeed , Monday &apos;s econonic calandar was bare , with only so-called minor data due out this week . 
the data were not expected to have much market impact . 
also , the Federal Reserve &apos;s policy setting committee meets but no change in rates were forecast . 
therefore , stocks , the dollar and technical factors will dominate activity on Tuesday , market participants said . 
on Monday , even as the market was reacting to the gyrations in the stock market , technicals played a part in the continuation of the bond market &apos;s rally . 
the September contract , for instance , broke through its 114-4 / 32 resistance level , rising as high as 114-12 / 32 before retreating to 114-3 / 32 at the close . 
the market was said to be eyeing 114-15 / 32 , a 50 percent retracement from recent lows . 
Treasury prices opened higher on Monday , on buying from European central banks and retail accounts . 
activity was very light , with volume at around $ 55 billion . 
one trader said that if not for the early stock to bond re-allocation , most of the Street would have been on the golf courses . 
Thomas Estes , head trader at SBC Warburg , said the stock trade was overstated . 
he said that the market would have been &quot; considerably higher &quot; if there had been a concerted outflow from stocks . 
others argued that the early strong performance of the short end was helped by the stock trade , much like on Friday when a &quot; flight to quality &quot; was reported as the Dow industrials fell 3.1 percent . 
three-month bills closed down one basis point to yield 5.12 percent . 
six-month bills were up one basis point at 5.15 percent and year bills were unchanged at 5.21 percent . 
the 10-year issue was up 7 / 32 at 99-12 / 32 to yield 6.21 percent . 
the five-year was 2 / 32 higher at 99-25 / 32 to yield 6.05 percent and the two-year was unchanged at 100-3 / 32 to yield 5.82 percent .
