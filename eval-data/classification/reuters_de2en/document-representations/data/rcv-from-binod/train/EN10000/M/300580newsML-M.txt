state-owned Indian Oil Corp ( IOC ) is expected to buy three 40-45,000-tonne high speed diesel cargoes in a supplementary tender for February delivery , industry sources said on Friday . 
sources said IOC was likely to buy two 1.0 percent sulphur cargoes from Kuwait Petroleum Corp at premiums between $ 1.59 and $ 1.64 per barrel over Middle East quotes on a cost-and-freight ( c-and-f ) basis to Kandla on the Indian west coast . 
IOC was also expected to buy one 0.25-percent sulphur cargo from Italian refiner AGIP at a premium of about $ 3.10 a barrel above spot Middle East quotes on a c-and-f Kandla basis , traders said . 
the tender closed on January 9 and offers were valid to January 11 . 
IOC has already purchases 720,000-tonnes by tender for February arrival cargoes , but it issued a supplementary tender soon after . 
expectations for the top-up tender were down from a day-earlier 200,000-tonne purchase and adding to the bearish tack of the Singapore gas oil market , traders said . 
the market was under downward pressure Friday due to reduced Chinese buying and large export supplies available from South Korea , they said . 
February gas oil swaps were quoted Friday afternoon at $ 30.40 / $ 30.50 , down from $ 30.90 / $ 31.00 on Thursday . 
for IOC &apos;s kerosene purchases , traders said India was likely to buy only one cargo for delivery to the east coast . 
the tender closed on January 9 and offers were valid to January 10 . 
IOC bought two kerosene cargoes totalling 90,000-tonnes for January delivery at $ 2.30 a barrel premium above Middle East quotes on a c-and-f Kandla basis and at 75 cents premium to Middle East quotes on a free-on-board Kuwait basis .
