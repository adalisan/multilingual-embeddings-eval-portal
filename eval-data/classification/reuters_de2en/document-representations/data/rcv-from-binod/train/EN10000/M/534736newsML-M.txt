the Czech crown lost ground towards the end of the day against its mark / dollar basket despite a central bank announcement that it had decided not to cut interest rates at its meeting on Thursday afternoon . 
one senior dealer said the crown was probably falling because of pessimistic appraisals of its medium term prospects from foreign investors . 
&quot; Despite two pieces of good news -- one is the trade balance and ( the other ) is no cut in interest rates , which are two invitations to carry trades again , -- the Czech crown has weakened at the end of today &apos;s trading , &quot; one trader said . 
earlier this week , the Czech Statistical Bureau said the trade deficit widened only slightly in March to 13.43 billion crowns from a revised 13.42 billion in February . 
despite the better than expected March trade figures , the Czech Republic has one of the largest current account deficits in the world , at 8.6 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , last year . 
on Wednesday , the governor of the central bank Josef Tosovsky said that the current account deficit was the main problem facing the Czech economy and rejected criticism that the tightness of monetary policy was responsible for the current slowdown in economic growth . 
last summer the CNB raised the discount rate to 10.5 percent from 9.5 percent and the Lombard rate to 14 percent from 12.5 percent . 
it also raised minimum reserve requirements to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent but two weeks ago cut reserve requirements back to 9.5 percent . 
immediately after the central bank monetary policy statement on Thursday , the crown staged a brief rally rising to around minus 1.2 percent against the mid-point of the basket but it subsequently fell back to around minus 1.7 percent against the basket .
