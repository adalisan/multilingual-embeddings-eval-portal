the United Arab Emirates &apos; supreme court on Saturday overturned a lower court ruling sentencing a Filipino man to death for killing an Indian national , the Philippines embassy said . 
the embassy source said UAE &apos;s Federal Supreme Court decision spared John Aquino from execution by firing squad after spending seven years on death row . 
&quot; Fortunately the ( lower court ) judgement was declared invalid ... by the supreme court , &quot; an embassy official said . 
&quot; There will now be a new trial which will be to be conducted by the supreme court itself . 
the embassy said it had not yet been notified of the date for the retrial . 
&quot; Mr Aquino was very , very glad about the ruling . 
he was very happy , &quot; the official said . 
Aquino was sentenced to death by a criminal court in the emirate of Ajman in 1989 for stabbing to death Harbajan Singh and the attempted murder of another Indian man during an argument . 
the official said the embassy had not yet received a copy of the supreme court ruling , and further details of its decision were not available . 
the Federal Supreme Court makes the final ruling on death sentences , but any execution must be approved by UAE President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan . 
the UAE came under international criticism last year when a court sentenced Filipina Sarah Balabagan to death for stabbing her 70-year-old employer to death . 
she claimed he had tried to rape her . 
Sheikh Zaid intervened and persuaded the victim &apos;s family to drop the death sentence in exchange for a financial settlement , referred to as blood money . 
Balabagan returned to the Philippines in August after serving nine months of a one-year sentence .
