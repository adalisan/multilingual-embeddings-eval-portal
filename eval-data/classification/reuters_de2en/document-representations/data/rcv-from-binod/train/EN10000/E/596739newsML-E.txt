Italian yearly consumer price inflation is seen continuing its downward trend in May although the monthly rate is likely to show a rise on the previous month , a Reuters poll showed on Thursday . 
the 10 analysts surveyed on average saw May inflation showing a month-on-month rise of 0.2 percent and an annual rate of 1.5 percent . 
Italy &apos;s 11 sample cities are due to publish their preliminary CPI data next Wednesday and Thursday . 
the final national figures will be issued on June 4 . 
in April , inflation rose 0.1 percent on a monthly basis and 1.7 percent year-on year . 
in May 1996 , inflation rose 0.4 percent month-on-month and came in at a yearly 4.3 percent . 
Marco Ricci of brokers Centrosim said the year-on-year fall would reflect &quot; above all a statistical effect in comparison with May last year which was a very high rate . 
analysts noted that weighing on the May monthly CPI rate was the so far unknown impact of recent rises in postal charges and in fruit and vegetable prices . 
Rodolfo Dozio of Banca Commerciale Italiana , which forecasts a monthly increase of 0.2 percent and yearly rate of 1.5 percent , said some postal tariffs had risen a lot while others were increased by only minor amounts . 
&quot; If all postal tariffs had risen by the 20 percent affecting some charges then we would have expected a May monthly CPI rise of 0.2 percent and yearly rate of 1.6 percent , &quot; he said . 
some noted that recent abnormal weather , with drought and frost affecting large parts of the country , could have had an impact on prices of fresh produce . 
&quot; The falling trend in the food sector has fizzled out and from May prices should be steady or very slightly higher , &quot; said Lucia Trevisan of Caboto securities house . 
Paolo Casadio of Credito Italiano saw food sector prices , which soared 4.8 percent in May last year , posting a monthly 0.4 percent rise although on a year-on-year basis they would show a fall of 0.2 / 0.3 percent . 
the analysts also said that durable goods could have a certain effect on May prices . 
but this sector , said Trevisan , &quot; should not weigh too much because demand is very weak .
