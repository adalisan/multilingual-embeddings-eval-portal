Indian global depositary receipts ( GDRs ) firmed in hectic London trading after the resignation of Congress party parliamentary chief P.V. 
Narasimha Rao , with blue chip stocks spearheading the market strength , traders said . 
&quot; The market is up , there &apos;s been a shortage of liquidity but we &apos;ve seen strong demand , &quot; said one trader here . 
the Casenove GDR index ended up 3.28 percent after the Bombay Sensex Index ended up 1.16 percent at 3,035.91 . 
the HSBC James Capel Indian GDR index closed 1.78 points , or 2.92 percent higher at 62.70 points , with the premium over the local market at 21.26 percent compared with yesterday &apos;s 19.01 percent . 
prices rallied on the local market shortly before the close of play on expectations that former finance minister Mahmohan Singh might take over from Rao . 
traders said blue chip stocks including Bajaj , State Bank of India ( SBI ) and Hindalco were among the day &apos;s biggest GDR gainers . 
SBI , whose GDRs rose $ 1.00 to $ 17.00 on Thursday , and the Bank of Baroda are expected to lower their prime lending rates after the second round of reduction in the cash reserve ratio in January . 
Bajaj Auto GDRs climbed $ 1.08 to $ 31.95 , while Hindalco gained $ 1.16 to end at $ 23.45 . 
Korean GDRs continued to firm during the trading day after the finance ministry urged public pension funds to buy into the depressed domestic market . 
but local brokers say the rally was likely to peter out by the new year . 
the Capel Korea GDR Index ended 3.36 points , or 5.47 percent firmer at 64.77 , a premium of 46.58 percent over the local market , compared with yesterday &apos;s 48.67 percent . 
Taiwanese GDRs softened , however , after institutional sellers on the underlying market offset earlier gains . 
Capel Taiwan GDR Index however eased , losing 0.28 points or 0.30 percent to 93.48 points , a premium of 3.79 percent after 3.14 percent on Wednesday .
