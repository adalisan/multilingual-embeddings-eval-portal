Canada spot propane prices firmed in moderate trade this week amid an uptick in winter heating and crop drying demand , traders said on Thursday . 
in eastern Canada , Sarnia spot propane soared about 2.50 cents since last Thursday to between 55.75 cents and 56.50 cents a gallon . 
postings ranged widely , between 52.50 and 56.50 cents , making the spot market difficult to narrow down . 
&quot; Winter demand for propane is starting to pickup and so is crop drying , &quot; said one Sarnia trader , adding much of the corn crop is in Ontario . 
in western Canada , Edmonton hub spot propane also soared about 2.50 cents in line with firmer U.S. Midwest prices , which have been gaining on strong crop drying demand . 
Edmonton is usually about 5.50 cents below Conway , Kansas , hub values . 
meanwhile , Sarnia normal butane rose 2.50 cents to 52.00 / 53.00 cents amid an increase in gasoline blending for winter driving fuel , traders said .
