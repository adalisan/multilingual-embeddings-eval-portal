about 5,000 U.S. troops in Germany are awaiting Pentagon orders for a Bosnia mission to help in the withdrawal of U.S. forces when their U.N. mandate ends in December , a U.S. military official said on Monday . 
the troops , assigned to the army &apos;s First infantry Division in Wuerzberg , will be sent to Bosnia as a &quot; covering force &quot; for U.S. soldiers who are scheduled to begin leaving as their year-long commitment to the Implementation Force ( IFOR ) ends . 
&quot; We expect to get a mission but we do not have any orders yet . 
we have been training and taking steps toward prudent planning , &quot; said U.S. Army Major Dave Daigle , a spokesman for the U.S. European Command in Stuttgart . 
Pentagon officials are expected to announce the deployment as soon as this week . 
troops will then begin leaving Germany by bus and train for staging grounds in Hungary and Croatia before entering Bosnia . 
the U.S. now has 15,000 troops serving in the 52,000-strong IFOR force , which was sent in last December to police the Dayton peace accords . 
U.S. officials have set a cap at 20,000 as the total limit of U.S. forces allowed on the mission . 
the bulk of the soldiers now in Bosnia are from the First armoured Division , which is also based in Germany . 
orders for the troops in Wuerzburg could depend on a final date being set for municipal elections , but the troops , who have already undergone training , are expected to be in place before the voting . 
the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) has postponed the elections until November 22 due to voter registration irregularities . 
NATO sources have said ministers have agreed the current force would not begin a withdrawal until after the elections . 
officials said the alliance was committed to providing the same sort of security blanket it gave to countrywide polls on September 14 , but emphasised any postponement would not delay the start of the current withdrawal plans . 
Daigle said the additional troops would not be part of the follow-up troops under discussion by U.S. and NATO officials . 
&quot; This mission will be to provide protection as they go about closing up camps during Operation Joint endeavour , &quot; Daigle said . 
&quot; This is not a follow-on force . 
this is a covering force to protect troops . 
there is no change in the posture . 
U.S. military planners are expected to approve sending a &quot; balanced combined arms unit &quot; that will include infantry units , tanks , armoured personnel carriers and air defence units .
