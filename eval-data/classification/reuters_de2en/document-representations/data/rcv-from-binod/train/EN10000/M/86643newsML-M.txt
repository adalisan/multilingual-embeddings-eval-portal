key December Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures staged a sharp rise to regain the 122 level on Monday after rate comments by Bank of Japan Governor Yasuo Matsushita , which reached the market early in the morning . 
Matsushita said in Washington that a recent fall in long-term interest rates may reflect changes in sentiment about Japan &apos;s economic prospects . 
his comments , virtually denying a wire report on Friday that the BOJ is concerned about excessive falls in interest rates , prompted those who had made short positions on Friday to clear their positions , dealers said . 
the December contract closed at 122.20 , just off the day &apos;s high of 122.21 , against Friday &apos;s close of 121.45 . 
volume was 41,002 contracts . 
&quot; The market simply came back to where it was on Friday before the wire report , &quot; said a dealer at a city bank &apos;s securities affiliate . 
short positions in the market may have been bigger than generally thought after the market fell for three sessions until Friday . 
the market was then distracted by a rumour that August industrial data could be worse than expected , dealers said . 
before the data &apos;s release at 3.30 p.m. ( 0630GMT ) , some dealers talked of an unfounded rumour that it would show a month-on-month decline of about three percent , compared to market expectations of a fall of about one to two percent . 
some dealers said this speculation also helped the contract to go higher . 
the figure unveiled by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) was undramatic , though , showing production declined 1.9 percent in August from the previous month . 
following the data &apos;s release , the December contract in London slipped a little . 
cash JGBs also went down slightly . 
those who had bought on the rumour may have unloaded their positions , a dealer at a long-term credit bank said . 
another dealer at a trust bank pointed to a MITI forecast of 3.2 percent production growth in October . 
&quot; This figure was pretty good . 
it &apos;s not a bad idea to sell after watching this . 
in the cash JGB market , the yield of the benchmark 182nd 10-year JGBs rose a little to 2.825 percent from 2.820 percent after the production data . 
but as of 0740 GMT , it had slipped back to yield 2.815 percent , down 0.055 from Friday .
