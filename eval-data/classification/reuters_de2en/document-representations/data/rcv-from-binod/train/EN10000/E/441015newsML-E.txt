Spanish inflation plunged to its lowest level in 29 years in February , and economists said they expected the Bank of Spain to acknowledge the moderation by sanctioning its second interest rate cut of the year on Friday . 
Spain reported on Thursday that consumer inflation dived to a 2.5 percent year-on-year rate in February from 2.9 percent in January , abruptly fulfilling the inflation requirement for Europe &apos;s monetary union and the government &apos;s target for 1997 . 
the minority Popular Party government has made Spanish participation in the common currency launch in 1999 the cornerstone of its European policy and inflation had been seen as one of its toughest challenges . 
the government had set itself a target of 2.6 percent inflation for the end of the year . 
&quot; In just two months we have come down seven-tenths which is a push for Spanish convergence in European monetary union and market credibility , &quot; Economy Secretary Cristobal Montoro said . 
economists , who had predicted a drop in inflation to just 2.7 or 2.8 percent , said the rate -- the lowest since January 1969 &apos;s 2.4 percent -- would persuade the central bank to cut its key rate at its regular repurchase tender on Friday . 
seven of 10 analysts surveyed said the Bank of Spain would respond by cutting 25 basis points off the six percent rate . 
&quot; Before inflation , I didn &apos;t think that they would cut rates , but the data was impressive and now I think they could cut by 25 basis points , &quot; said Juan Antonio Mielgo , economist at the Bank of America . 
the Bank of Spain last cut on January 16 , shaving the rate by 25 basis points to six percent . 
it has been easing since December 1995 after the rate peaked at 9.25 percent , and many economists have been expecting further reductions . 
&quot; This is surprisingly good CPI , &quot; said Carmen Hernansanz , economist at Merrill Lynch Espana . 
&quot; There &apos;s a high probability that the Bank of Spain will cut rates by 25 basis points at tomorrow &apos;s repo or at the next one . 
in any case , we think there &apos;ll be a cut in March . 
inflation data for the last two months gives sufficient room for it , &quot; she said . 
the government said the drop put inflation , pending the harmonised European data , beneath the single currency limit . 
a country &apos;s inflation may not exceed the average of the three best performing members by more than 1.5 percentage points . 
the government has tightened finances and introduced liberalisation measures in a bid to meet the economic requirements for the single currency on inflation , deficit , debt , currency stability and long-term interest rates . 
but the peseta &apos;s recent instability and uncertainty surrounding progress between unions and employers on key labour market reforms would keep the Bank of Spain from cutting rates by a larger amount , economists added . 
a minority felt these factors -- coupled with disquiet about service prices -- would prevent the central bank from cutting on Friday . 
&quot; Both headline and core inflation fell very impressively , but service inflation is still stubborn ( up 0.4 percent versus January ) and this is what is worrying the Bank of Spain , &quot; said Colin Warren , economist at Tokai Bank in London . 
&quot; In terms of the rate outlook , I guess they &apos;re still worried about service inflation . 
the labour reform isn &apos;t ready yet . 
they will wait to see the peseta more stable and they would like to have deficit numbers , &quot; he said .
