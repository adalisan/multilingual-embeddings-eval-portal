Russian artillery and aircraft pounded the Chechen capital Grozny for several hours on Wednesday as new contradictions surfaced over Moscow &apos;s policy towards the breakaway region . 
the military in Chechnya , humiliated by separatists who captured much of the city on August 6 , seemed determined to use whatever force required to drive the rebels out of Grozny . 
but President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s security chief , Alexander Lebed , who visited Chechnya on Wednesday for the third time in just over a week , wants to use peaceful means to resolve the conflict , in which tens of thousands of people have been killed . 
&quot; I come with peace , &quot; he said as he arrived at the Russian army based outside Grozny , according to Itar-Tass news agency . 
the president himself , seen just once in public since July 26 , stayed out of sight , although Interfax news agency said he would return to Moscow on Wednesday from a two-day break in the lakelands of northwestern Russia and be back at work at the Kremlin on Thursday . 
Yeltsin &apos;s press office , which has been almost as elusive as the president in recent days , could not comment on the report . 
&quot; We are aware of the report . 
we can neither confirm it nor deny it , &quot; a spokesman said . 
Yeltsin &apos;s disappearance has unsettled Russia &apos;s financial markets , where traders are also alarmed at a series of media reports that the president has had a recurrance of the heart problems which put him in hospital twice last year . 
one rumour circulating on Wednesday said Yeltsin was dead , but this , like the other reports , was denied by the presidential press office . 
he has been signing decrees , &quot; a spokesman said . 
Yeltsin &apos;s absence has also increased the sense of confusion about who is in charge of Russian security issues , which are theoretically shared between Lebed &apos;s Security Council and the ministries for defence and the interior . 
&quot; When Yeltsin is absent there is a pervasive feeling that nobody is in command , &quot; said one Western diplomat . 
&quot; The basic problem is the lack of any regular institutional line of command on security matters . 
defence Minister Igor Rodionov on Wednesday dismissed an ultimatum by Russia &apos;s deputy military commander in the region for people to quit Grozny or face bombing raids . 
many civilians , afraid that the threat will be carried out , have already fled Grozny , although others are still hiding in the cellars of the city , home to 400,000 people before Russia sent in the troops in December 1994 to crush an indepedence bid . 
trapped residents , whose fears were heightened by shelling and bombing on Wednesday afternoon , pleaded for help . 
&quot; Our houses are bombarded continuously from heavy weaponry . 
we are in a desperate state , without bread , water , or light . 
there are no fighters in our houses , no soldiers , and no one is firing from them , but the bombardment never stops , &quot; said a handwritten statement from local residents handed to reporters . 
&quot; We are living in uncertainty and confusion , we feel that we have been abandoned in our own country . 
we ask that you do everything possible to stop this war . 
troops from both the defence and the interior ministries are based in Chechnya , but Lebed said after a visit there last week that they were demoralised and poorly clothed and equipped . 
the latest fighting -- the head of the military prosecutor &apos;s office in Chechnya told Ria news agency that 420 Russian servicemen had been killed and 1,300 had been wounded -- has prompted criticism at home and abroad . 
&quot; It should be clear to the parties involved that after 20 months of conflict the dispute there cannot be resolved by use of force , &quot; U.S. State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said . 
&quot; There has to be an element of negotiation . 
the German Foreign Ministry said Russia should look for a peaceful solution involving the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which on Wednesday abandoned its central Grozny office in anticipation of the threatened bombing . 
Russian human rights campaigner Sergei Kovalyov , recovering from a heart attack , called on Yeltsin to stop the fighting . 
&quot; Something monstrous is happening right before our eyes , &quot; the former dissident told an outdoor news conference on Pushkin Square in the centre of Moscow . 
Kovalyov , once Yeltsin &apos;s human rights commissioner , was always an outspoken critic of the 20-month-old Chechen campaign in which more than 30,000 people , mostly civilians , have died .
