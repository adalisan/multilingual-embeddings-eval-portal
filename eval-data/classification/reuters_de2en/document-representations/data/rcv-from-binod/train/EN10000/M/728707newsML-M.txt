the Czech National Bank ( CNB ) said on Tuesday it would drain liquidity from the local money market through a two-week reverse repo tender , with maximum yield set at 16.2 percent . 
the limit rate was unchanged from a similar operation on Monday , which failed to attract any bids . 
the CNB said it would accept two bids from each party totalling at least 100 million crowns before the deadline at 10 : 10 a.m. ( 0810 GMT ) .
