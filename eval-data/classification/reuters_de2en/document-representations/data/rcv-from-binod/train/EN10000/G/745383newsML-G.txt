the government of the Indian Ocean Comoro Islands arrested the main leader of a secessionist movement on Anjouan island in what family members said on Tuesday was a trap . 
Foundi Abdallah Ibrahim , 75 , was arrested by security forces late on Monday after being called by three government emissaries to the office of newly appointed Governor Cheikh Allaoui for a meeting , witnesses said . 
&quot; From the beginning my father did not want to follow the emissaries but he did so at the strong insistence of my brothers , &quot; Siti Abdallah Ibrahim , one of the leader &apos;s daughters , told Reuters . 
&quot; Continue the struggle until recognition of the fundamental rights of the Anjouan people , &quot; Ibrahim said in a message from a police station read on a private television station . 
secessionists on Anjouan , demanding independence or a return to the French fold , closed down the island &apos;s five prefectures on Monday in response to a government decision last week to outlaw two main pro-secessionist parties , witnesses said . 
the Comoro Islands has a population of 190,000 and became independent from France in 1975 . 
residents of Anjouan , the second island , argue independence has brought only poverty and civil strife . 
at least two people including a gendarme were killed on Anjouan on Monday last week in clashes between pro-secessionists and the security forces . 
several people were killed in clashes in March .
