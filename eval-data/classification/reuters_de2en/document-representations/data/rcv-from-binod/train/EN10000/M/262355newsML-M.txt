a combination of the coming holiday season and wait for the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting later today made sure that very few investors were prepared to brave the emerging debt market on Tuesday . 
&quot; There &apos;s a bit of position squaring . 
but clients are more risk averse at the moment , especially with the recent volatility of the ( U.S. ) long bond , &quot; one European bank trader said . 
though a market consensus is for no change in interest rates at the FOMC meeting , traders said investors remain extremely wary of a sudden move in U.S. treasuries which might knock into Bradys . 
in any case , the market for emerging debt appears to be already coming to a halt for this year , they added . 
Russia continued to attract some modest interest after the government managed to win over both the International Monetary Fund for a loan and parliament to approve next year &apos;s budget . 
but traders said market lethargy prevented prices from moving up much . 
Bulgaria was also a touch firmer , though it remains off its recent highs . 
one trader said there has been some increased interest in Croatia recently , possibly in anticipation of a high credit rating either this year or in January . 
however , in a recent research report , Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said it was unclear whether it would be given investment grade . 
though its track record on economic reform probably deserves investment grade , politicial considerations complicated matters . 
&quot; Until some of the domestic uncertainties have been clarified , we struggle to see yield spreads falling much below 150 basis points , &quot; the bank said .
