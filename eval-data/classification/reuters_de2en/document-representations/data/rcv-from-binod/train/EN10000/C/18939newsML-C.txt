TransCanada pipelines Ltd said on Wednesday it scheduled a 26-day maintenance run on its Canadian natural gas mainline in September . 
the maintenance on the cross-Canada system was not expected to affect firm transport customers , but about 350 million cubic feet per day of interruptible transport would likely be cut , said TransCanada spokesman Tony McCallum . 
the work was scheduled to start on September 3 and end on September 28 , McCallum said . 
he said the work , which was expected to take place at various locations in Ontario , would include about 4.O km of pipe replacement , in-line inspection and maintenance to 35 compressor stations along the route . 
traders said on Wednesday they expected the maintenance window to pressure Alberta spot gas prices in September as the curtailed interruptible volumes were backed up into the province . 
the TCPL mainline carries about 6.2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas to eastern Canada from the Alberta-Saskatchewan border .
