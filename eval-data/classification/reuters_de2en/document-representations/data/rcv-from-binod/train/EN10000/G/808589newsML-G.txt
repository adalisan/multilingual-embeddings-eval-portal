some of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami &apos;s cabinet nominees , under fierce criticism from conservatives in parliament , will have to put up a strong defence on Wednesday to survive their critics . 
Members of parliament spent 10 hours on Tuesday scrutinising Khatami &apos;s 22 cabinet nominees , with conservatives singling out one minister designate as a &quot; liberal &quot; threatening the future of the Islamic republic and another for alleged disloyalty towards Iran &apos;s supreme leader . 
Parliament is due to vote on Wednesday after a third five-hour session during which the cabinet nominees will defend themselves and their programmes . 
analysts expect the majority of Khatami &apos;s cabinet to be approved by the 270-member parliament but believe that key domestic ministries essential to the president &apos;s hopes for carrying out social reforms could face setbacks . 
Khatami &apos;s nomination of Ataollah Mohajerani to head the sensitive Culture and Islamic Guidance Ministry and Interior Minister designate Abdollah Nouri came under sharp attack on Tuesday from conservatives and hardliners . 
&quot; The main danger at this sensitive time is cultural leniency and liberalism and we promise ... to resist it to the last drop of our blood , &quot; said deputy Ahmad Nejabat . 
&quot; When someone suggests talking to America I wonder how the Imam feels , &quot; Nejabat said , referring to the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini who led the 1979 revolution that deposed the U.S.-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi . 
Mohajerani was repeatedly criticised for having advocated talks with Washington in 1990 and for his moderate views . 
his backers responded that he had quickly withdrawn the proposal . 
the Culture and Islamic Guidance Ministry has emerged as a battleground between Khatami &apos;s backers , who want to breathe more freedoms into the Islamic republic , and conservatives who see the body as a key weapon against a &quot; Western cultural invasion &quot; . 
the Culture Ministry has a major influence on daily life as it decides what media , books , films and music are allowed in the country . 
Khatami , a 54-year-old moderate Shi &apos;ite Moslem cleric , was elected in a landslide in May on promises of carrying out social , cultural and economic reforms . 
Nouri was also challenged by conservative deputies and one member publicly cast doubt on his allegiance to parliament and supreme spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . 
some deputies scoffed at hints that parliament had to accept Khatami &apos;s cabinet because of his huge election win . 
&quot; Some deputies and newspapers reason that since President Khatami received 20 million votes in the election , we have to vote for all the ministers . 
but the Majlis ( parliament ) has 24 million votes behind it , &quot; said deputy Abufazel Razavi Ardakani . 
candidates for the agriculture , higher education and oil ministries also came under heavy fire from the eight conservative deputies who spoke in a second five-hour session . 
seventeen pro-Khatami deputies spoke to urge the 270-seat parliament to pass its necessary vote of confidence on the entire cabinet with thinly veiled warnings to conservatives that they could not ignore Khatami &apos;s election mandate . 
&quot; In the May elections people called for fundamental changes in the management of the country so as an deputy I feel obliged to respect the people &apos;s vote and agree with the proposed cabinet of the elected President , &quot; said deputy Zarei Ghanavati .
