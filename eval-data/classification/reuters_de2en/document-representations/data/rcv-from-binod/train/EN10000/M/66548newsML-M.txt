short-term trading rates on Zimbabwe &apos;s money market slipped on Friday in sympathy with the benchmark treausry bill rate which came down at Thursday &apos;s weekly auction , dealers said . 
&quot; The inflation rates dropped recently and obviously trading rates also had to come down in line with that , &quot; one dealer said . 
inflation fell to 17.7 percent in August from 22 percent in July , and analysts attributed this to a reduction in food prices . 
meanwhile on Friday , discount houses were taking up 91-day central bank paper at 21.46 percent , down from the 22.49 percent set at last week &apos;s tender , and were also selling them softer at 21.25 from 22 percent . 
NCD bills maturing after 30 , 60 and 90 days were being bought and sold lower at 23 and 22 percent respectively from Thursday &apos;s 23.5 and 22.75 percent while bankers acceptances slid to 21.75 and 21.25 from 22.75 and 22 percent across the board . 
call money shed half a percentage point to 21.50 percent in a market which opened with a surplus figure of Z $ 382 million from Z $ 600 million the previous day .
