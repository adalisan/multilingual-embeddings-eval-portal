the Bank of England allotted a total of 50 million stg in money market repos maturing on April 10 , 11 and 14 on Wednesday in what could be the last of its regular , fortnightly repos . 
the Bank of England offered repos maturing from April 10-14 and also April 24-28 to the money market at a rate of six percent . 
only 50 million pounds of the shorter-dated repo was taken up . 
it will commence on Thursday . 
the Bank said it would not offer rollover of the facility after this round , but it would hold it &quot; in abeyance for future use if necessary . 
the Bank introduced gilt repos into its daily money market operations at the start of this year and has enjoyed some success . 
traders said the main advantage of the new system , which deprives the discount houses of their historically cosy relationship with the Bank , is that more people can participate directly . 
the Bank now has a much clearer idea of how much money people are looking for in the cash market .
