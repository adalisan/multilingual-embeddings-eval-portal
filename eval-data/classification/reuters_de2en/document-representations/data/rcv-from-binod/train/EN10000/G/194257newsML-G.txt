Pakistan produced an irresistible combination of speed and spin to lift the singer Champions trophy after a compelling fightback against New Zealand in the final on Friday . 
although dismissed for a meagre 160 in 48.5 of their 50 overs , Wasim Akram &apos;s Pakistanis bowled to such telling effect that they routed New Zealand for 119 to snatch a 41-run victory . 
new Zealand , spurred by a second wicket stand of 59 between Mark Greatbatch and Adam Parore , were well placed to win at 66 for one , only for their last nine wickets to tumble for 53 . 
Greatbatch , promoted to open for the first time in the tournament , hit 52 off 80 deliveries with seven fours while Parore chipped in with 22 off 59 balls , but no one else reached double figures . 
the turning point came when Waqar Younis and Akram , both returning for a second spell , ripped through a tentative middle order . 
Akram , named man of the match , took three for 20 , and there was effective support from off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq and wrist spinners Mushtaq Ahmed and Shahid Afridi , each claiming two wickets . 
earlier , New Zealand confounded expectations by dismissing the overconfident Pakistanis for 160 in the absence of their frontline pace bowlers Danny Morrison and Simon Doull -- out for groin and hamstring injuries respectively . 
all New Zealand &apos;s bowlers stuck to their task , keeping a tidy line and length . 
they were fired up by the early fall of in-form Saeed Anwar , caught by Stephen Fleming off Justin Vaughan on the fifth delivery of the match . 
Anwar , with two centuries to his credit in the tournament , scored just one . 
Pakistan could not recover from the early blow . 
most of their top order batsmen fell to overambitious shots , their inexplicable haste for plundering runs contributing to their dowfall . 
only Salim Malik and then Moin Khan applied themsleves to the task of steady the innings . 
Malik , who made 40 off 58 balls with one four and one six , and Azam Khan ( 22 off 55 balls ) posted the biggest stand of the innings -- 53 off 87 balls for the fifth wicket . 
with Pakistan fast running out of overs and wickets , Moin Khan chipped in with a useful 32 off 44 deliveries , striking three sixes , two in one over from Chris Harris . 
for New Zealand , Chris Cairns , Harris and Dipal Patel took two wickets each , but it was Gavin Larsen , playing in his first match of the tournament , who returned the most economical figures of one for 22 in nine overs . 
new Zealand captain Lee Germon attributed defeat to inept batting : &quot; We did a great job by restricting Pakistan to 160 , but our batsmen blew the chance . 
Pakistan skipper Akram paid tribute to the fighting qualities of his team . 
&quot; Despite being bowled out for 160 , we fought back tremendously -- this is what you call the killer instinct of the game .
