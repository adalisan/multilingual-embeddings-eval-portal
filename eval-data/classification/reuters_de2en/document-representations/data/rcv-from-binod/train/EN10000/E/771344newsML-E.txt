South Korea &apos;s consumer price index ( CPI ) rose 3.7 percent in July , down from a 5.4 percent rise a year earlier , the finance ministry said on Thursday . 
a ministry official said the index for foods and food products rose by 3.3 percent year-on-year in July while that for non-food items gained 3.8 percent . 
the ministry attributed the low price increase in July to drops in international crude oil prices and subsequent price cuts by local oil products makers . 
prices for several industrial goods also fell in line with intensifying sales competition among makers , it said . 
consumer prices for farm , livestock and fishery products rose by 2.3 percent year-on-year , against a 4.8 percent gain in July 1996 , it said in a report . 
the growth in oil products prices also slowed to 12.3 percent in July from 19.9 percent a year earlier and that in public utility fares eased to 4.4 percent from 7.0 percent . 
the government has targetted keeping the CPI growth , South Korea &apos;s major inflation indicator , below last year &apos;s level of 4.5 percent .
