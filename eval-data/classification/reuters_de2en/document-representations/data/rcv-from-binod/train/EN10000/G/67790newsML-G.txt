Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov , outlining Moscow &apos;s vision of post-Cold War European security , said on Friday stationing NATO &apos;s military might closer to Russia &apos;s borders was &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; . 
Primakov , who was due to meet NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana in the Austrian capital at 1430 GMT , said Moscow was aware it had no right of veto if former Soviet bloc members wanted to join the Western military alliance . 
&quot; However , Russia finds it absolutely unacceptable that NATO &apos;s military infrastructure should come closer to its territory , &quot; he said in an address to the Vienna-based Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 
Moscow &apos;s outright opposition to NATO expansion relaxed a notch following President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s victory in presidential elections in June . 
Primakov then suggested a limited expansion of NATO to the east may be acceptable if no troops or weapons were stationed inside the new member states . 
Ex-Warsaw Pact states the Czech Republic , Hungary and Poland are front-runners to join NATO , probably next year . 
Slovenia said on Friday it also had a good chance of joining the 16-member alliance in the first wave of new members . 
setting out Russia &apos;s ideas for a pan-European security framework , Primakov said Europe , together with its partners in North America , had to grasp the chance to set up new structures otherwise new lines of division based on military alliances would emerge across the continent . 
&quot; Unfortunately , a trend toward this eventuality does exist . 
in our opinion , the intention to expand NATO to the east will reinforce it , &quot; he added . 
Primakov said the 53-member OSCE , which includes most of Europe , the United States and Canada , was uniquely positioned to be bolstered into Europe &apos;s main security body . 
&quot; The model should envisage counteraction against an entire range of threats , both military and terrorist , as well as challenges in the economic , ecological , humanitarian and other fields , &quot; Primakov told OSCE ambassadors . 
Primakov went on to suggest that all organisations involved in security policy should have an input in a restructured OSCE -- the United Nations , NATO , the Council of Europe , the European Union , the Western European Union ( the EU &apos;s defence arm ) as well as the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) . 
Russia is expected to press for the proposals to be seriously addressed at the OSCE &apos;s summit in Lisbon in December as a balance , or alternative , to further NATO expansion , diplomatic sources said . 
the Russian foreign minister said he hoped a treaty to set up the new body would be ready at the next OSCE summit in 1998 . 
Primakov made no reference in his speech to proposals put forward by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier this month to draw up a new charter defining NATO &apos;s ties with Russia or an enhanced Partnership for Peace programme to include countries not accepted into the alliance in the first wave of new entrants . 
following talks with Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky earlier , Primakov said he hoped Austria would not give up its neutrality and join NATO but stressed such a move was solely a matter for the Austrian people . 
during the Cold War , the Kremlin had insisted that Vienna should remain neutral , a commitment it made to ensure Moscow pulled its World War Two occupying forces out of Austria in 1955 .
