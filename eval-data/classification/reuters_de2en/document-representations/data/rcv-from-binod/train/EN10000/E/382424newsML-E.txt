India &apos;s richest state on Monday launched a bid to lure billions of dollars into the province &apos;s creaking infrastructure sector , promising speedy government help and clearances . 
&quot; I am told that as many as $ 150-200 billion can easily be channelled by overseas Indians into our country , &quot; said Manohar Joshi , chief minister of western Maharashtra state . 
&quot; We have only to evolve an appropriate national policy to attract a substantial portion of this wealth for infrastructure investments . 
India &apos;s commercial hub of Bombay is the capital of Maharashtra . 
Joshi said the state had identified 55 projects , mostly infrastructure , that would cost $ 5 billion to set up . 
&quot; To ensure that these projects take off in a record time , the state government has given advance clearances in as many cases as possible , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I &apos;m confident that the Centre ( federal government ) too would give its clearances in a prompt manner . 
he was addressing a two-day investment convention attended by 900 delegates from 25 countries which ends on Tuesday . 
inaugurating the convention , Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda said the government would do everything to remove hurdles that blocked foreign investment and denied there was any dithering in decision-making . 
Srichand Hinduja , a rich expatriate Indian and president of IndusInd International Federation , one of three sponsors of the convention , said red tape was a major obstacle that affected foreign investment . 
&quot; All this is now changing , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We &apos;re experiencing a growing awareness and investor-friendly approach . 
on Monday , P &amp; O Australia Ports Pvt Ltd , a wholly-owned unit of Peninsular and Oriental steam Navigation Co of Britain , signed an agreement to develop a port in Maharashtra . 
the $ 1 billion project involves an initial outlay of $ 360 million in the first phase . 
grossly inadequate infrastructure , poor utilisation of existing ventures and lack of government funds were cited as crucial problems , said P.C. 
Alexander , governor of Maharashtra . 
&quot; One port in Rotterdam handles 288 million tonnes , while all ports in India handle only 177 million tonnes , &quot; he said .
