Cambodia &apos;s economy , weighed down by a bloated civil service and an inadequate tax system , faces a make-or-break budget year in 1997 , the country &apos;s finance minister warned on Thursday . 
&quot; In many respects 1997 will be for Cambodia a moment of truth , &quot; Keat Chhon wrote in a grim report delivered to international donors on Thursday . 
he chided government officials for failing to set clear priorities in their 1997 budgets and for hiring more staff , despite strong recommendations from international donors that the roughly 150,000-strong civil service be slashed . 
&quot; Preparation for the ( $ 556 million ) 1997 budget confirmed the lack of rigour and discipline -- not to mention laxity -- which characterise the financial and administrative management of state departments , &quot; he wrote . 
Keat Chhon &apos;s report was provided to the Consultative Group of multilateral and bilateral donors , which gathered in Phnom Penh on Thursday to discuss the country &apos;s progress . 
the finance minister &apos;s report noted there were signs that gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth , estimated at six percent , was slowing , and stated that the riel was &quot; barely stable &quot; after depreciating for months against the dollar . 
other concerns for 1997 included the cost of Cambodia joining the Association of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , which he said would double its diplomatic budget , and the cost of bringing thousands of Khmer Rouge defectors into the army . 
a ban on all log exports would severely cut into revenues , he added , and questioned where spending on health and education could come from in the future . 
Keat Chhon , who has consistently championed ambitious tax reform , emphasised the government must broaden its revenue base . 
customs revenue provides 72 percent of taxes raised . 
&quot; Tax revenue &apos; lingers &apos; around six percent of GDP , maybe seven percent in 1997 ... Only Bhutan ( 4.7 percent ) has a lower average in the region , &quot; he wrote . 
after decades of war , Cambodia &apos;s economy has attained stable inflation and scratched out an average of nearly seven percent GDP growth , but per capita GDP still remains at under $ 300 per year .
