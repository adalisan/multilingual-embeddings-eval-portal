a businessman in Spain &apos;s Basque country was killed on Tuesday in the third fatal attack blamed on the separatist group ETA this week . 
the man , identified as Francisco Arratibel , was shot in the head in the Basque town of Tolosa in Guipuzcoa province , police said . 
the attack occurred aday after a gunman fatally shot a Supreme Court judge in the head in Madrid and a car bomb killed an employee of a military base in the southern city of Granada . 
&quot; We are living in a moment of escalating terrorism on different geographical fronts , &quot; Spanish Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja told reporters on Tuesday . 
&quot; Yesterday there were ( attacks ) in Granada and Madrid and today in Guipuzcoa . 
the spiral of violence over the past month has presented Spain &apos;s nine-month-old conservative government with its most difficult period so far in the long-running conflict with Basque separatists but officials said it would not alter its policy of refusing to negotiate with the guerrillas . 
&quot; It is one of the most delicate moments , &quot; Deputy Prime Minister Francisco Alvarez Cascos said of the recent violence . 
Monday was the bloodiest day in Spain since December 1995 when a car bomb killed six Navy employees near Madrid . 
also on Monday , a leader of ETA &apos;s political wing Herri Batasuna ( HB ) was found hanged at his home in the Basque country hours before he was due to appear before the Supreme Court . 
the court has summoned the entire 25-person leadership of HB to answer charges of distributing a video to promote ETA during last year &apos;s election campaign . 
an HB leader warned last week that Spain would pay the price for the Supreme Court action . 
Basque police said the businessman killed on Tuesday had acted as an intermediary in negotiations between ETA and the family members in a 1988 kidnapping . 
Arratibel was convicted in 1994 for mediating in the kidnapping and sentenced to two years probation , police said . 
ETA later accused him of keeping part of the ransom money and last May planted a bomb outside his company but it was defused , police added . 
ETA is suspected of five killings in the past month and a Basque journalist described the atmosphere in the northern region as the most tense since the fascist dictatorship of Fransciso Franco . 
about 800 people have been killed since 1968 in ETA &apos;s drive for an independent homeland . 
Interior Minister Oreja reiterated the government &apos;s rejection of peace negotiations with the ETA . 
&quot; Today for the terrorists negotiations are not a formula to end ( the conflict ) . 
they are a symbol of victory , &quot; Oreja said . 
he was speaking at the funeral for the Supreme Court Judge Rafael Martinez killed in Monday &apos;s attack . 
&quot; The government reiterates the principles of the anti- terrorist struggle -- primarily we must not be coerced by the violence and the terrorists , &quot; he said . 
Oreja predicted more violence . 
&quot; We still have before us a future of pain but we shouldn &apos;t give in to defeat too soon .
