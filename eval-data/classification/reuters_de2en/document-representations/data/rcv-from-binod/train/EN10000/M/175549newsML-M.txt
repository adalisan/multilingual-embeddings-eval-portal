a meeting of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) and Japanese September trade and current account data will be the main highlights for financial markets in the coming week , analysts said on Friday . 
while Wednesday &apos;s meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve &apos;s rate-setting FOMC is expected to bring no change in interest rate policy , it will still exert an influence on the markets . 
&quot; The economic slowdown and continued good behaviour of inflation mean people are going to be fairly relaxed ( about interest rates ) , &quot; said Ian Harwood , head of strategy and economics at Kleinwort Benson in London . 
he said there would still be some residual anxiety that the Fed may raise rates , but it was most unlikely to happen . 
U.S. October producer price and consumer price data , on Wednesday and Thursday respectively , will affect bond market sentiment if they come in higher than expected , but forecasts were muted , analysts said . 
Harwood said Thursday &apos;s October retail sales and Friday &apos;s industrial production were also likely to show continued easing of economic growth . 
in Japan , markets will be looking for comments and indications about dollar / yen after comments from Japanese Ministry of Finance official Eisuke Sakakibara on Thursday that the dollar &apos;s recovery was about to end . 
&quot; The Japanese current account figures will be influential there , &quot; said Paul Donovan , senior economist at UBS in London . 
the September trade balance and current account data , to be published Monday , are expected to justify the shift in policy and indicate a stronger yen policy in the future . 
&quot; The weak yen policy has been very useful in stimulating the Japanese economy but has outlived its usefulness , &quot; said Paul Meggyesi , senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London . 
he said the pace of decline in the trade surplus was slowing and players would scrutinise the data for signs of confidence that trade trends were changing . 
Harwood said trade account data would be watched for a strong revival in exports and a deceleration of import growth . 
&quot; The trade figures might not be as conducive to good relations between the U.S. and Japan as people have been assuming . 
it will be a busy week in Britain . 
October producer prices , due on Monday , are forecast to show a rise in output of 0.2 percent compared with a rise of 0.4 in September . 
&quot; On Wednesday there is another welter of inflation data with average earnings and unemployment , &quot; said Harwood . 
October retail prices on Thursday will also be key . 
&quot; There is growing concern that above-trend economic growth is jeopardising inflation stability and the market will be sensitive to any indications that inflation is now in an upward trend , &quot; said Meggyesi . 
in Europe , markets will watch Thursday &apos;s meeting of the Bank of France . 
&quot; The French economy still needs all the help it can get from lower interest rates , particularly as French banks aren &apos;t passing on the full benefits of cheaper money , &quot; said Harwood . 
&quot; People will probably be looking for a further cut in rates at some point . 
Meggyesi said the focus for investors in Italian markets will be November 17 &apos;s deadline for the lower house of parliament to approve the 1997 budget , after which markets will be hoping for a cut in interest rates and a decision about re-entry to the ERM .
