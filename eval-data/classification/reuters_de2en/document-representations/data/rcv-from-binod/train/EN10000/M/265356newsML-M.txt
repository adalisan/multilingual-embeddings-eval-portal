Dutch money market rates moved up somewhat on Wednesday after the central bank allocated 3.28 billion guilders under a new six-day special advances pact at an unchanged rate of 2.50 percent . 
dealers said most activity was in the short end , where call money traded at 2.88 percent , and up to two-month deposits . 
they said the pact , replacing a five-day facility of 4.76 billion guilders , would underpin money market rates until extra money flows into the market . 
&quot; On Thursday and Friday , payments to public officers will total a sum near 16 million guilders , making the new pact look a little ampler . 
but today , call is up because the allocation seems tight , &quot; one dealer said . 
he added he expected call money to rise on Friday on the back of the usual end-of-week effect . 
&quot; Especially before Christmas , people will need more cash , &quot; he said . 
money market rates seemed unimpressed by an upward revision of the 1996 Dutch gross domestic product growth forecast this morning . 
the Dutch statistics agency CPB said it expected Dutch GDP to grow 2.75 percent in 1996 , raising its forecast from an earlier 2.50 percent , while keeping its forecast for 1997 of 2.50 percent . 
&quot; There is little chance this will trigger a hike of Dutch rates . 
around us , some central banks are still cutting theirs , while others are likely do so in the first half of next year , &quot; one dealer said . 
he added that the Dutch central bank was not expected to raise rates soon and might even be tempted to follow its neighbours by moving them downwards . 
tomorrow &apos;s Bundesbank meeting , after which the German 1997 M3 growth target will be announced , is not seen having a big impact on Dutch short rates . 
&quot; They will probably stick to this year &apos;s target ( of four to seven percent ) , &quot; one dealer said .
