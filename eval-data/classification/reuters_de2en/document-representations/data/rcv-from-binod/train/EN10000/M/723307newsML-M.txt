CBOT soybean futures were expected to open two to four cents per bushel lower on forecasts showing rain for much of the Midwest , traders said . 
&quot; It looks like we &apos;re going to see more rain and have more coverage over the weekend , &quot; traders said . 
many U.S. forecasters are showing a rain system moving from west to east through the Corn Belt , which should deliver good amounts of rain from Friday through the beginning of next week , traders said . 
weekly crushing data from the National oilseed Processors Association was also seen weighing on prices , traders said . 
NOPA put the crush as 23.014 million bushels , which was below trade expectations for 23.50 to 24.50 million . 
changes the U.S. Department of Agriculture made to the soy supply and demand table were as expected , traders said . 
USDA put 1996 / 97 ( Sept / Aug ) soybean ending stocks down five million at 125 million bushels and raised 1997 / 98 ending stocks to 285 million from 240 million a month ago .
