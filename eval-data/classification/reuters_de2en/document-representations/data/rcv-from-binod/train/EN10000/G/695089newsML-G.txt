Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Sunday he was &quot; extremely satisfied &quot; with the way elections had been conducted in Albania . 
&quot; Apart from one little incident , the elections took place with the greatest possible order and our troops played a very important role in preventing any irregularities or incidents , &quot; he told reporters in the northern Italian city of Bologna . 
&quot; I want to thank our troops because they &apos;ve contributed to the greatest expression of democracy a country can have -- free elections . 
&quot; We will now ask them to be present and vigilant for the second round , to make that sacrifice . 
an official was shot dead in a village near the southern Albanian city of Fier but otherwise Sunday &apos;s general election passed off without the widespread violence which has gripped the country for months . 
Italy has led the 7,000-strong International Protection Force in Albania since its deployment in April .
