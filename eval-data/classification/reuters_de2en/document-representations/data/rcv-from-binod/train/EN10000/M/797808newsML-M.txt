the FTSE 100 index will lose its grip on the 5,075 level and drop to around 5,000-5,025 region on Wednesday with shares of banks and pharmaceuticals coming under pressure , technical analysts said . 
no sooner than fighting its way back up on Tuesday , the market will be forced to beat a retreat after a collapse on Wall Street on Tuesday night , they added . 
as is usually the case whenever there is a sharp fall on Wall Street , UK shares will be marked down initially in order to fend off some selling pressure . 
just how successful this manoeuvre will be depends very much on wholesale inflation data from the U.S. due at 1230 GMT . 
there is likely to be cautious trading ahead of the producer prices data for July where consensus forecast is for a month-on-month rise of 0.1 percent . 
even excluding the volatile food and energy component , the rise is forecast to be 0.1 percent . 
analysts believe a rise greater than 0.2 percent will not be tolerated by the market and will have the effect of share prices falling as fears will increase that Thursday &apos;s consumer prices data will also be greater than expected so that the probability of a hike in U.S. interest rates becomes greater . 
also weighing on the market will be U.S. retail sales for July and if this is greater than 0.7 percent , share prices will weaken . 
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average fell 101.27 points to 7,960.84 .
