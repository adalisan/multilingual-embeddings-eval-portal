of the 100 members of the U.S. Senate , Connecticut Democrat Joseph Lieberman stands alone . 
he is the only orthodox Jew in the chamber . 
Lieberman observes the rigid dietary laws of Judaism . 
on the Sabbath , he will not travel , write , engage in political activities or use electricity . 
and he says he is deeply influenced in his political life by Jewish ethics and texts . 
&quot; It &apos;s a wonderful organising principle of my life . 
it gives it order , a sense of purpose , but it also provides me , in terms of the Sabbath , with a sense of sanctuary in my week which has become more important to me as I &apos;ve gone on in life and become busier , &quot; Lieberman told Reuters in an interview . 
he said he would always show up for Senate votes on the Sabbath but he declined to appear at the convention that nominated him to his first Senate term because it was held on the Sabbath . 
&quot; The Sabbath has become more important probably psychologically than physically , as well as spiritually , as a day to set aside for gratitude to the Almighty and to be with family , &quot; he said . 
Lieberman occasionally consults Jewish religious texts and speaks to his rabbi about political issues heavy with spiritual content . 
a recent example was the question of assisted suicide , which Lieberman opposes . 
more often , religion stays in the background , but its influence is always there . 
&quot; There &apos;s no question that my religious upbringing and my religious education was a major contributor to who I am . 
one example is his commitment to a strong national defence policy , which has sometimes put him at odds with his fellow Democrats . 
he said that goes all the way back to when he was 13 and had his barmitzvah -- the Jewish ceremony that marks the passage from boyhood to manhood . 
at the ceremony , he read a passage from the book of Exodus telling how the Amalekites attacked the Children of Israel from the rear , an act that the Bible says could neither be forgiven nor forgotten . 
Lieberman backed the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989 and was one of the leaders in the fight for a resolution backing the U.S.-led war to expel Iraq from Kuwait in 1991 . 
&quot; Without his earnest and vehement support , it might not have passed , &quot; according to the 1996 edition of the Almanac of American Politics , a guide issued annually by the National Journal magazine . 
on another issue , abortion , Lieberman finds himself at odds with most conservative Christians . 
ultimately I decided that , after all my struggling with this question , we really had to respect the right of women to choose , &quot; he said . 
in 1994 , when Republicans swept to control of both houses of Congress and a Republican won election as governor of Connecticut , Lieberman won his own Senate re-election battle with 67 percent of the vote . 
the Almanac of Politics said that in his first Senate term Lieberman exerted influence far out of proportion to his seniority , committee position or political clout . 
in his second , his influence has only increased . 
one of the first senators to endorse Bill Clinton &apos;s first presidential bid in 1992 , Lieberman has now emerged as leader of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council . 
his relationship with the President goes back to 1970 , when Clinton , then a Yale University law student , volunteered to work on Lieberman &apos;s first campaign , for the Connecticut state senate . 
Lieberman has also forged a strong alliance with Vice President Al Gore , especially on environmental issues , which he also attributes to his religious faith . 
&quot; As a committed Jew , fundamental to our religious tradition is the notion that there is a God who created the world and everything on it , &quot; he said . 
&quot; That really has contributed to the priority I &apos;ve given to environmental protection as a matter related to our stewardship , our trusteeship over the Earth . 
unlike many Jews , Lieberman says he is not threatened by the rise of the Christian conservative movement , even though most of its adherents vote for Republicans . 
&quot; I find myself out of step with a lot of the Jewish community . 
I don &apos;t view the rise of religious groups in politics as an unnerving or negative development .
