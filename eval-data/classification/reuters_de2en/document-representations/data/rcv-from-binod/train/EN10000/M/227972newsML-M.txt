gold &apos;s recent lows could be attributed to central bank selling and producers trying to make up shortfalls in their forward sales positions , South African gold analysts said on Monday . 
gold was near a fresh low on Monday as rumours of sales by South African and Australian producers and of central bank selling of bullion swept the market . 
gold was fixed at $ 370.50 per ounce on Monday morning -- its lowest level since April 25 , 1994 , when the precious metal was fixed at $ 370.25 . 
it fixed at $ 371.50 on Friday . 
&quot; The pressure at the moment is from central banks &apos; selling and speculators who believe that central banks could sell , &quot; Fedsure Asset Management analyst Nick Goodwin said . 
other analysts cited weak physical demand and possible sales of gold by South African producers -- who on average sell about 30 percent of their gold forward . 
&quot; Rumours of heavy selling out of South Africa might amount to nothing more than normal selling -- just selling at a time when the market wants to make the best out of bad news , &quot; gold analyst Trevor Pearton of stockbrokers Societe General , Frankel Pollak said . 
but Pearton said it was possible that the world &apos;s largest gold producer , Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd , could have increased gold sales towards the end of the year . 
&quot; All I can think of is that Anglo American might not have got together the forward position they would have liked to over the course of the year and left a bit of selling for the last month . 
&quot; December is traditionally a very buoyant month for gold and with too many people leaving their sales too late in the year , we could be seeing that effect , &quot; Pearton added . 
analysts said Anglo American &apos;s hedging policy was to sell about 35 percent of its gold production forward . 
&quot; They are always in the market ... They sell about 35 percent of their gold forward , &quot; Goodwin said . 
but other analysts pointed to weak physical demand for gold as the reason for the lower price . 
the physical demand is just very weak . 
I would be a bit surprised if our guys were doing a lot of selling that would be shaking the market , &quot; said a Johannesburg gold analyst who asked not to be identified . 
traditionally gold demand reaches its peak between November and February as the jewellery industry buys gold to provide for Christmas shopping in the west . 
this coincides with the end of the monsoons , the Indian wedding season and the other major festivals in Asia where gold is sought after for jewellery . 
dealers said the Chinese New Year traditionally gives another boost to jewellery buying which feeds back into the bullion market . 
but dealers said as bullion prices eroded this year , the jewellers and other physical buyers had been less active .
