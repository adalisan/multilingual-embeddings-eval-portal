the Inter American Development Bank ( IADB ) said on Wednesday that it has approved a $ 250 million loan to Mexico for various projects to improve the efficiency of the Labor market . 
the multilateral organization said in a statement that it was the first loan aimed specifically at the Labor market in Latin America , one of the poorest regions in the world . 
the loan has a 20-year maturity with a three year grace period and a floating interest rate , currently at 6.87 percent , the IADB said . 
the money will form part of a program by the Mexican government to help train unemployed workers and give financial incentives and technical advice to small and medium-sized businesses to help train their workers .
