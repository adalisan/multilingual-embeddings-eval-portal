French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette telephoned Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf on Sunday to try to defuse a row over whether Paris was interfering in the violence-racked North African country . 
he told Attaf that France &apos;s official policy of non-interference in Algeria had not changed , a French ministry statement said . 
Attaf said on Friday that Paris should not to meddle in his country &apos;s internal affairs after days of debate in France over the crisis in Algeria , where the military-backed government is battling Moslem rebels in a conflict that has claimed 60,000 lives . 
de Charette &quot; expressed his solidarity with the Algerian people , victims of violence . 
he confirmed that French policy guidelines towards Algeria were unchanged from those he had expressed in the past , &quot; the statement said . 
de Charette also said he would adopt the principles that Attaf wanted to guide Franco-Algerian relations -- &quot; mutual respect based on non-interference , a balance of interests and coordination on matters of mutual interest , &quot; it said . 
Algeria has been without an elected parliament since 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election which the now outlawed Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) was poised to win . 
opposition Socialist leader Lionel Jospin and ex-president Valery Giscard d &apos;Estaing , head of the National Assembly &apos;s Foreign Affairs Committee , urged the French government last week to do more to solve the crisis and push for free elections . 
and , according to a Foreign Ministry statement , de Charette told a parliamentary committee behind closed doors that France hoped Algerian general elections would take place &quot; under open and incontestable conditions , and include representatives of all legal political parties . 
the influential French daily Le Monde said de Charette also told the committee that the Algerian authorities had made repression their top priority and a political solution to the crisis was becoming less likely . 
Jospin urged France to consult its European partners on a joint initiative , saying no one dared to discuss the conflict while Paris stayed silent about Algeria , which won independence from France in 1962 after a bloody war . 
Giscard d &apos;Estaing said on Saturday he felt he had broken a taboo by speaking out on Algeria . 
he urged elections in which all democratic forces , including Islamists , could have a say . 
he noted that France and other European countries had criticised Russia &apos;s use of military force in the breakaway region of Chechnya before a peace accord last year and so should not feel bound to silence about worsening violence in Algeria . 
suspected Moslem guerrillas killed 31 people at the weekend in Medea , south of Algiers , the independent Algerian newspaper El Watan said . 
if confirmed , at least 225 people have died during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan that started on January 10 .
