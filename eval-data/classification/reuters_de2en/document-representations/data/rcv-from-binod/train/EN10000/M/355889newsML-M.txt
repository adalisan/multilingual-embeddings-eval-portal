Indonesia &apos;s central bank planned to offer repo of central bank papers ( SBIs ) totalling 300 billion rupiah to stabilise high rupiah demand , dealers said . 
one state bank dealer said repos on SBIs will be offered in the morning and might be raised later if demand remained high . 
dealers said demand was high due to the upcoming lunar new year on February 7 and the EID al-Fitr on February 9 and 10 . 
one Japanese bank dealer said overnight rupiah was traded at 17.0 / 17.5 percent early on Tuesday .
