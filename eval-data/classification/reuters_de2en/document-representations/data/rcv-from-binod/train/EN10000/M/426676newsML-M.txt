Hong Kong stocks closed Friday trading on a weak note , chiefly influenced by the cautious trend seen in the U.S. bond and equity markets , brokers said . 
&quot; The main factor is the wavering seen in the U.S. bond market last night , said David Robinson , regional investment strategist at HSBC James Capel . 
the Hang Seng Index closed 79.01 points lower at 13,337.35 , after hitting a low of 13,304.24 in late afternoon trade . 
the U.S. long bond ended down 22 / 32 at 96-24 / 32 to yield 6.88 percent on Thursday from 6.83 percent on Wednesday and the Dow Jones Industrial average eased 1.15 points to 6,944.70 . 
most institutional investors in Hong Kong were sidelined in advance of the U.S. unemployment report for February due out later on Friday , brokers said . 
further tightening in the U.S. labour market could be inflationary , thus reigniting concerns of higher U.S. interest rates . 
the market was only briefly buoyed by the news of the modest but positive sales prices hikes announced by Cheung Kong for its latest luxury residential property development project . 
&quot; The point is any optimism generated by this sale has already been discounted by the market , &quot; said Robinson . 
Cheung Kong announced during the morning session that it was selling units in the prime Kowloon development at an average price of HK8,286 per sq FT , just 10 percent above analysts &apos; estimates of HK $ 7,500 per sq FT . 
the property sector was the worst performing . 
investor interest in China plays was a chief feature of the market . 
&quot; Interest might switch to those with a land bank of low cost properties in China , such as newcomer Shum Yip , &quot; said Charles Cheung , executive director at J &amp; A Securities . 
the Shenzhen-government backed issue ended its first trading day at HK $ 4.525 on turnover of HK $ 1.01 billion , the most active stock of the day . 
the company offered 250 million shares to the public at HK $ 1.85 per share . 
&quot; This is too much too fast , &quot; said Cheung . 
&quot; I think we will see Shum Yip consolidate before it rises again .
