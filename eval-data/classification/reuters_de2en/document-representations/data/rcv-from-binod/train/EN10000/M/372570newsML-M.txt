U.S. Gulf Coast refiners eschewed pricey crudes from across the Atlantic on Wednesday , opting for domestic alternatives and short-haul Latin American crudes instead , traders said . 
the spread between benchmarks West Texas Intermediate / Cushing and North Sea Brent was around $ 1.40-50 a barrel Wednesday afternoon , up 25 cents from Tuesday afternoon , but still too narrow for economic transatlantic activity , traders said . 
in a move that reflects the closed transatlantic arbitrage , a U.S. domestic refiner agreed with a major broker to swap a March 5-10 Brent cargo for a Colombian Cusiana . 
meanwhile , a U.S. company is still showing some West African qua Iboe , brass River and Cabinda / Nemba cargoes loading at the end of February at around dated Brent plus $ 2.10-20 a barrel . 
the closed arb , combined with concerns over an ongoing public-sector strike in Colombia , lit a fire under domestic grades early on Wednesday . 
the grades deflated , however , when traders realized that the strike was not affecting loadings as yet . 
&quot; I haven &apos;t seen anything to make me worry yet , &quot; said one regular Cusiana buyer who is awaiting a pair of spot cargoes in March . 
elsewhere in Latin America , state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. resumed spot crude sales this morning after breaking for Carnival . 
traders noted some strengthening , with Mesa 30-gravity crude fetching a discount of around $ 2.90 a barrel , compared to $ 3.00 last Friday .
