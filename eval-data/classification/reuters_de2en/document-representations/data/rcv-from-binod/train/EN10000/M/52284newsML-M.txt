solid buying on dips below 1.51 marks helped the dollar to bounce back against the mark after a seesaw session that saw it hit two month highs and test the downside after a soft set of U.S. economic data . 
U.S. consumer price and retail sales data below expectations pressured the dollar to session lows initially as some of the interest rate rise speculation gripping the market cooled . 
but after digesting the data the market took the view that a rate hike remains a possibility as other economic data point to a robust U.S. economy , analysts said . 
&quot; The data has eased some of the aggressive rate hike speculation for a 50 basis point hike , but the feeling is that a 25 basis points rise might still be on the cards , &quot; said Brian Kiely , treasury technician at Royal Bank of Scotland . 
at 1444 GMT the dollar traded at 1.5122 / 28 marks and 110.34 / 40 yen compared with 1.5129 / 34 and 110.11 / 21 in late European trading on Thursday . 
the consumer price index edged up 0.1 percent in August from July in both the overall and the core rates , below the 0.2 percent rise expected . 
Weaker-than-expected August retail sales also sparked initial dollar sales , traders said . 
both overall and core retail sales rose 0.2 percent , below average expectations of a 0.7 percent rise overall and a 0.4 percent increase gain ex-autos . 
but strong gains in U.S. Treasury bonds helped limit dollar losses , keeping firm support at 1.5060 marks out of play . 
&quot; At the end of the day , nothing much has changed . 
the market is still expecting a 25 basis point rise , and the dollar will probably crawl a bit higher in the run-up to the FOMC meeting , &quot; said a senior trader at a German bank in London . 
traders generally expect the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) to sanction a 25 basis point rise in the Fed funds rate . 
the dollar &apos;s upside is being limited by trading strategies that have become more and more short-term as interbank operators are quick to take profits or cut losses , leaving the dollar out of breath on attempts on the upside , analysts said . 
the dollar broke a key level at 1.5060 marks today , its high from July and a 61.8 percent retracement of its entire fall from May highs just below 1.55 marks to the mid-1.46 area in July . 
the dollar rose to 1.5173 but the move failed to trigger a wave of buying typically associated with such a move . 
&quot; It &apos;s very frustrating when such a move doesn &apos;t generate follow-through buying , &quot; said Alan Collins at Merita Bank . 
buying of Swiss francs against the mark also helped the dollar higher against the German currency , while a firm mark / yen cross rate lent a helping hand to dollar / yen , traders said . 
the dollar was firmly back above 110 yen after an initial drop below that psychologically important level on news that Japanese gross domestic product fell by a less-than-expected 0.7 percent in the second quarter from the previous three months . 
economists had forecast a 1.1 percent drop . 
&quot; The dollar looks well supported against the yen , &quot; said Collins , head of technical analysis at Merita . 
&quot; There are bids all the way down . 
the background factor of the Iraq crisis continued to lend the dollar some support but a further escalation could hurt the U.S. currency , analysts said . 
if the action is not seen as being a policy victory for the U.S. it could start to drag on the dollar . 
any further boost to oil prices will hurt the U.S. bond market , a potential negative for the dollar .
