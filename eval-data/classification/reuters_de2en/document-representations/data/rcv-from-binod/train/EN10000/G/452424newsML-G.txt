John Major is watching James Cooper dangling from some branches , pretending to be a tree surgeon in distress . 
the 18-year-old is supposed to be unconscious after falling from the treetops when his safety line broke . 
the prime minister looks uneasy , perhaps realising that the scene could be a visual metaphor for the stunned state of his Conservative party after its freefall in the opinion polls . 
but Cooper is soon rescued by his fellow cadets displaying Conservative values of leadership , hard work and self-reliance that Pangbourne School inculcates and that Major , visiting for his daily campaign photo-opportunity , wants to promote . 
he moves on , relieved that there will be no repeat of the previous day &apos;s fiasco , when he was photographed next to a racing car propped up on trestles . 
&quot; Wheels come off Major &apos;s election machine &quot; was one predictable headline in Wednesday &apos;s press . 
Pangbourne College is hardly a typical British school . 
the private college , founded in 1917 to train boys for the navy , charges fees of 12,000 pounds a year -- about two-thirds of gross average earnings -- and no class has more than 18 pupils . 
but the school , set in rolling country an hour west of London , serves Major &apos;s purpose precisely . 
thanks to the government &apos;s &quot; assisted places scheme &quot; , almost a tenth of Pangbourne &apos;s 375 pupils come from working-class families that get help with the fees . 
children of millionaires share cold showers with those of poor single mothers . 
the main opposition Labour party is committed to scrapping the assisted places scheme and using the money saved to reduce the size of primary school classes to a maximum of 30 . 
labour leader Tony Blair , who has placed education at the top of his agenda for the May 1 election , says this encapsulates his party &apos;s determination to govern for the many not the few . 
major retorts that it shows Labour is driven by the politics of envy and is intent on stopping people like Pangbourne &apos;s students from getting on in life . 
&quot; One of the reasons I came here was to draw attention to the opportuntities that exist for youngesters from low-income households to actually have the advantages of the assisted places scheme and come to schools like Pangbourne . 
&quot; It actually is an indication of excellence in education , the sort of excellence that I would like to see right the way through the education sector , &quot; Major told reporters . 
the most relaxed part of the visit is when he takes off his jacket to answer questions from about 40 pupils gathered in the headmaster &apos;s study . 
he deals deftly with issues ranging from Northern Ireland to his party &apos;s divisions over Europe . 
the pupils of voting age are impressed . 
major has won over at least one voter , then , in his fight to lead the Conservatives to a fifth election victory in a row . 
but as he helicopters back to London , journalists on the press bus learn of a still-fresh tragedy that risks souring the next day &apos;s coverage . 
in 1993 , a 16-year-old Pangbourne pupil , instead of play-acting , hanged himself for real .
