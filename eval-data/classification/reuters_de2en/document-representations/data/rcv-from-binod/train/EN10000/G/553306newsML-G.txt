President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and rebel leader Laurent Kabila prepared on Thursday for face-to-face talks at sea with South Africa &apos;s Nelson Mandela amid confusion over the timing of the meeting . 
Mobutu &apos;s camp said the talks would focus on a peaceful transition with elections open to all , Kabila &apos;s camp insisted that the veteran strongman must stand down after more than three decades in power . 
but as the civil war rivals and mediators variously announced that the talks would start on Friday , Saturday and Sunday , the rebel advance on the capital Kinshasa continued . 
&quot; The talks will just be about Mobutu and what we do with him . 
our uncompromising demand is that he leaves power and we shall look after him , &quot; Kabila said before leaving his Lubumbashi headquarters for talks in neighbouring countries . 
&quot; There can be no ceasefire or indeed elections in this country until Mobutu and all he represents is removed and thrown away , &quot; Kabila added . 
there was no indication Mobutu , who seized power in 1965 but is sick with cancer , was ready to step down -- although rebel &quot; foreign minister &quot; Bizima Karaha said the veteran president had agreed to discuss his departure . 
&quot; We are happy that Mobutu has agreed to come and negotiate one and only one thing : his departure from power , &quot; Karaha said . 
U.S. envoy Bill Richardson , who helped persuade Mobutu and Kabila to meet , told reporters in Kinshasa on Wednesday there were no preconditions for the talks . 
Mandela said through a spokesman that he would chair the face-to-face talks on Friday aboard a South African naval vessel in international waters off the coast of West Africa . 
Mobutu &apos;s son Nzanga said the talks had been postponed until Saturday . 
Karaha said Kabila could only attend on Sunday . 
Honore Ngbanda , Mobutu &apos;s security advisor and hitherto chief negotiator , envisaged talks on &quot; a peaceful transition leading to transparent and democratic elections that exclude no-one &quot; . 
Kabila &apos;s rebels , who took up arms in October , say they expect to take the capital over the next 10 to 15 days . 
they now control over a half of the sprawling Central African nation -- including all its main cities outside the capital . 
residents of Kenge , just 200 km ( 125 miles ) from Kinshasa , said the army had retreated and that the town was calm and waiting for the rebels to arrive -- a familiar pattern in the seven-month campaign . 
residents of Kikwit , the rebels forward base for their march on Kinshasa , said an expected rebel airlift into the town had not begun but that reinforcements had been arriving by truck . 
the war has trapped Hutu refugees , who fled Rwanda fearing reprisals after the 1994 genocide of Tutsis . 
critics accuse Zaire &apos;s Tutsi-dominated rebels of killing refugees -- or at least leaving them to die . 
international efforts to repatriate the Hutus gathered pace . 
a U.N. refugee agency official said 1,438 were flown out of Zaire &apos;s third city of Kisangani on seven flights on Thursday to Rwanda &apos;s capital or its southern town of Cyangugu . 
thousands of other Hutus , many with appalling injuries , streamed back to camps south of Kisangani as U.N. agencies struggled to clear a backlog of those waiting to be airlifted . 
aid workers at Biaro camp , 41 km ( 25 miles ) south of Kisangani , said they could not keep up with a flood of refugees returning to camps they fled in terror after attacks last week .
