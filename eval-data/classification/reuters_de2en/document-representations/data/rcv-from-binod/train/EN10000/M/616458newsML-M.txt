Mexican stocks fell Tuesday as analysts said investors shied away from gains on Wall Street and stood on the sidelines while awaiting the outcome of a central bank auction later in the day . 
&quot; Basically , there was concern over month-end pressure on the peso and money market liquidity , which changed the outlook for the Cetes ( bond ) auction , &quot; said Esteban Rojas , associate research director at the Arka brokerage . 
final closing figures placed the blue chip IPC index down 24.16 points , or 0.61 percent , at 3,960.86 . 
trading volume was a meagre 50.8 million shares . 
&quot; The bourse , to a certain extent , is discounting an increase in primary rates , as opposed to the falls we expected last week , &quot; Rojas added . 
a Reuters survey conducted before the auction showed money market traders had forecast Banco de Mexico would assign bellwether 28-day Cetes rates at an average of 18.19 percent . 
this would represent an increase of .12 percentage point since last week &apos;s auction . 
individual estimates ranged from 17.87-18.57 percent , which analysts said was a measure of market uncertainty . 
a sign of month-end pressure on debt market liquidity was overnight Cetes rates , which soared 1.40 percentage points to 18.50 percent . 
benchmark 48-hour peso contracts weakened by 2.3 centavos to 7.9360 / 7.9390 per dollar in early trade , on what analysts said was a delayed reaction to a narrower-than-expected trade surplus posted Monday . 
dealers noted the IPC had slightly recovered from a session low of 3,956.64 points but failed to match a recovery on Wall Street , where the Dow Jones closed up 37.50 points at 7,383.41 . 
&quot; It just didn &apos;t want to recover , &quot; a desk trader said . 
&quot; They &apos;re on standby . 
&quot; There was some selling this morning , but things stood still after midsession , &quot; a floor trader said . 
dealers said selling was most notable on retail stock Cifra , which came after strong gains posted Monday due to speculation over a forthcoming holdings sale . 
Cifra &apos;s three share series together accounted for 14 percent of all shares traded during the session . 
dealers observed that many Mexican ADRs failed to gain on the Dow Jones &apos; coattails . 
&quot; The ADRs are following us , rather than us following them , which would otherwise be a good sign , &quot; a desk trader said . 
ADRs listed by market heavyweight Telmex closed off 1 / 8 at 44-1 / 8 on Wall Street . 
the telecommunications company &apos;s L shares nonetheless ended up 6 centavos ( less than 1 cent ) at 17.46 pesos ( $ 2.21 ) in Mexico . 
&quot; Just look at how the peso shifted , Telmex obviously gained here on arbitrage trading , &quot; another desk trader said . 
financial group Bancomer was another noteworthy slider , which shed 9 centavos ( 1 cent ) of its recent sharp gains to close at 3.00 pesos ( 38 cents ) on fears of higher interest rates , traders said . 
on the broad market , 98 stocks changed hands , with decliners outpacing gainers by 57 to 19 . 
dealers said leading percentage gainers had all moved at wafer-thin volume and did not signal significant market trends .
