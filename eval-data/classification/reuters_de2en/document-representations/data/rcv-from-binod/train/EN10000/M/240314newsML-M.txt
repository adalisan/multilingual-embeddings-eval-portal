debt yields closed sharply up but off highs as the market tailed the international financial scare after a warning against &quot; irrational exuberance &quot; in asset markets by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan . 
a weaker than expected November U.S. job report helped Swedish debt to recover from the worst levels . 
&quot; Today trading has been driven entirely by foreign factors , &quot; said one dealer . 
six-month T-bill rates closed two basis points higher at 4.10 percent and ten-year bond yields rose twelve basis points to 7.04 percent after hitting 7.10 percent in early trade . 
the crown tracked a weaker dollar . 
at 1515 GMT , the mark had firmed to 4.4035 crowns from 4.3800 crowns on Thursday . 
dealers hope that the focus will shift to Swedish fundamentals next week . 
Swedish November CPI figures , to be released on December 12 , are expected to show a 0.1 percent drop in the month , taking the year-on-year figure down to deflation of 0.2 percent from deflation of 0.1 percent in October .
