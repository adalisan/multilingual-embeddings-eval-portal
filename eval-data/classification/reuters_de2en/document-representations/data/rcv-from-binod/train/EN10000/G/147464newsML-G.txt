six people , including an eight-year-old boy , were massacred by a suspected right-wing paramilitary gang in Colombia &apos;s northern Cesar province on Sunday , national radio reported . 
nine other people disappeared , presumed kidnapped , and one was hospitalized with multiple bullet wounds after a group of about 60 men , dressed in camouflage clothing , raided the village of Media Luna , close to Colombia &apos;s border with Venezuela , according to the RCN radio network . 
the attack took place just before midday ( 1500 GMT ) in the remote village , about 25 miles ( 40 km ) north of provincial capital Valledupar . 
police told RCN that the motives for the attack were not yet clear . 
the attackers arrived in three pick-up trucks and cut telephone lines before opening fire on their victims . 
before leaving , the gang scrawled pictures of machine-guns on walls in the village together with the initials &quot; ACCU &quot; , which stands for the so-called Peasant Self-Defence Group of Cordoba and Uraba -- a shadowy paramilitary group , possibly backed by regular members of the armed forces and police . 
the Peasant Self-Defence Group of Uraba and Cordoba has unleashed a bloody war against the country &apos;s leftist guerrillas , especially in northern and northwest Colombia where the rival groups battle for control of lucrative contraband routes . 
since the summer , the paramilitary group has kidnapped a number of close relatives of rebel chieftains in what they claim is a bid to stifle guerrilla activities . 
police were not immediately available to confirm details of the massacre .
