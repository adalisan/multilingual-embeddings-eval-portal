heavy snowfalls in the Himalayas left some 4,000 Hindu pilgrims stranded on Saturday on their way to a sacred mountain cave , an Indian police spokesman said . 
&quot; Around 2,500 are stranded near Sheshnag Lake and another 1,000 near Panjtarni , &quot; a police spokesman told Reuters in Jammu , the winter capital of the state of Jammu and Kashmir . 
&quot; Another 500 are in between . 
he said the pilgrimage to the cave of Amarnath in Jammu and Kashmir had been suspended until the weather improved . 
no casualties were reported . 
at least 214 pilgrims died last year after bitter winds and heavy snow lashed the trail to Amarnath , located 12,500 feet ( 3,846 metres ) above sea level , some 330 km ( 200 miles ) northeast of Jammu . 
&quot; They might resume the trek tomorrow . 
the snowfall has stopped , &quot; the spokesman said after a heavy snowfall at Mahagunus Top , a mountain pass at 14,800 feet above sea level , forced the devotees to stop . 
he said the pilgrims had erected tents along the route , where the temperature had fallen to five degrees Celsius ( 41 degrees Fahrenheit ) . 
Community kitchens set up to feed the devotees on the annual pilgrimage had enough food to last four days , the spokesman said . 
Sheshnag Lake is 306 km ( 184 miles ) northeast of Jammu , and Panjtarni lies 13 km ( eight miles ) further along the route to Amarnath . 
since the pilgrimage began on July 16 , more than 24,000 pilgrims have visited the cave , where they worship an ice stalagmite believed to be a symbol of Lord Shiva , the Hindu god of regeneration . 
the 5,000-year-old cave &apos;s chief priest says he expects 120,000 pilgrims to visit Amarnath this year .
