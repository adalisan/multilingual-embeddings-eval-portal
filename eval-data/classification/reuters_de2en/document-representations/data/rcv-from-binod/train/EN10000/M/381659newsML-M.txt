Romania &apos;s leu closed Monday lower at 7,500 / 600 to the dollar after idling at 7,200 / 300 throughout the day with traders waiting for the central bank ( BNR ) to name the banks reauthorised to act as dealers . 
&quot; The funny thing is that some of us will be acting as dealers again tomorrow but we still don &apos;t know which of us as the central bank has failed to make any announcement so far , &quot; said one trader with a bank relegated to a broker status on the local market last March . 
the BNR said last Friday several banks would get back their lost local dealer licences starting Tuesday . 
over the past year the local market operated with only four dealers . 
most operators said trading kept a subdued note with few hard currency offers coming mainly from foreign investors on the local capital market . 
but they said the market was still affected by squeezes , with hard currency holders awaiting weaker prices . 
&quot; I see the leu down at 8,000 in the next few days , &quot; said one trader . 
short-term rates went higher to some 130 percent for one-week funds on a money market plagued by leu shortages . 
traders said they were bracing for fresh news expected later on Monday when Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea sets forth a reform package which his centrist coalition government discussed with international lenders . 
the government is seeking up to $ 1.0 billion in total loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , which had withheld credits to Romania last year . 
Leu-dollar retail prices bobbed at 7,600 / 8,200 .
