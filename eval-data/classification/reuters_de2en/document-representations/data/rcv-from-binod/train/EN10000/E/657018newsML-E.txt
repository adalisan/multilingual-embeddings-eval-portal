Portugal can look forward to strong growth in output and consumption , helping it to cut its budget deficit to its official target of 2.9 percent of Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) this year , the OECD said on Thursday . 
&quot; fuelled by domestic demand , output growth is expected to remain strong , rising to approximately 3-1 / 2 percent in 1998 ( from around three percent in 1996 and 1997 ) , &quot; the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) said in its semi-annual report . 
reduced job insecurity , together with lower interest rates , should continue to spur private consumption , while gross fixed investment might accelerate with improved growth prospects and rising profitability , it added . 
&quot; The official target for the budget deficit ( 2.9 percent of GDP in 1997 ) is projected to be met , as revenues should continue to increase strongly with the recovery in output , lower tax evasion and the positive effects of measures to reduce tax arrears , &quot; the Paris-based OECD said . 
&quot; In 1998 , yields from structural measures adopted in previous years , along with cyclical revenue gains , should keep the fiscal deficit below three percent of GDP , &quot; it added . 
the OECD said the unemployment rate was projected to fall back to around seven percent in 1998 , at which level there should still be downward pressure on wage inflation . 
it forecast unemployment of 7.1 percent in 1997 , down from 7.3 percent in 1996 . 
wage moderation , together with further real exchange rate appreciation , was likely to help consumer price inflation remain below 2.5 percent in 1998 , the OECD said . 
on the external side , the current account deficit was expected to remain broadly unchanged at less than one percent of GDP , as the increase in the trade deficit , associated with a pick-up in import growth , would be partly offset by an increase in transfers , it said . 
it added that Portugal looked well-placed to continue the process of economic convergence , but warned that any market turbulence associated with European Union-wide doubts about Economic and Monetary Union could reverse the process of interest rate decline .
