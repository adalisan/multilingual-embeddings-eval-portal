Swedish shares closed higher on Tuesday after spending most of the day in the red , with telecoms major Ericsson leading the way aided by a strong open on Wall Street . 
the Stockholm general index rose 0.56 percent to 2,888.69 in turnover worth 3.87 billion crowns . 
&quot; It was a little uneasy today with some jitters over EMU but New York &apos;s fantastic strength dragged the bourse up in the afternoon , &quot; one broker said . 
Ericsson gained four crowns to close at 286 crowns amid positive market sentiment . 
&quot; Ericsson saw good turnover yesterday and it seems there was some profit taking , &quot; one broker said . 
&quot; But with the strength in the U.S. now I think we could see the share continue to go up . 
the drugs sector was in focus . 
Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn closed 8.5 crowns up at 277.5 . 
this followed an announcement about a merger of its life science unit Pharmacia biotech with that of British health and technology company Amersham International . 
&quot; It is more important in terms of sentiment . 
the company is trying to tidy up its portfolio . 
industrial engineer Atlas Copco was one of the day &apos;s losers after gaining 5.5 crowns on Monday . 
its shares ended 5.5 lower at 209.5 after the market digested the news of its seven billion crown takeover bid for U.S. machinery leasing group Prime Service . 
&quot; After people went home and did their calculations they decided the price was too high , &quot; a Stockholm based broker said .
