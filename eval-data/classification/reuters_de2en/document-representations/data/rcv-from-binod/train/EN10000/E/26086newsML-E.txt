Germany &apos;s inflation rate is unlikely to rise in the foreseeable future , Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing said in a speech prepared for delivery on Saturday . 
in the speech , to be delivered at a symposium in Jackson hole , Wyoming , sponsored by the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank , Issing said : 
&quot; In Canada , just as in Germany , the rate of inflation is at present below two percent and no new rise seems likely in the foreseeable future . 
Issing said that although inflation is down in many countries , central banks should not let up their guard . 
&quot; Things are not going so well in our economies that we do not have to be afraid of the temptation to solve problems through inflation becoming irresistible again , &quot; he said . 
West Germany posted a preliminary 1.4 percent inflation rate in August .
