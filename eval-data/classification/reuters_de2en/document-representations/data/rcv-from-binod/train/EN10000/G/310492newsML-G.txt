China handed over to U.S. military officials on Wednesday the remains of U.S. airmen who died 52 years ago when their bomber crashed into a remote mountain during a World War Two run . 
&quot; No matter where we must go or how much time it takes , America does not forget its warriors and we will endeavour to bring each and every one home , &quot; said Alan Liotta , deputy director of the MIA / POW ( Missing In Action / Prisoner of War ) office under the Department of Defence . 
a uniformed Chinese military officer handed over two wooden chests containing remains and a third containing personal effects to the U.S. defence team who visited the remote site of the crash on a mountain slope in the southwestern Guangxi region on Tuesday . 
&quot; Fifty years ago these brave young men scattered their blood over this beautiful region , &quot; said Liang Ziwei , director of foreign affairs in the town of Xingan . 
four U.S. soldiers in full military uniform took the boxes , exchanged salutes with the Chinese officer and placed a folded U.S. flag on each of the three boxes . 
local residents searching for wild herbs in thick forest discovered the crash site last October . 
the B-24 bomber with its 10-man crew never returned from a raid on Japanese ships around Taiwan .
