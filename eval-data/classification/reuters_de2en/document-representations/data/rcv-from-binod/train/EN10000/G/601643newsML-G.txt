Poles are about to vote on a new constitution to enshrine the democracy they won in 1989 but many anti-communist veterans say it betrays the Roman Catholic , patriotic values they struggled for . 
the Solidarity union and rightist parties , backed by strong hints from the church , are urging voters to reject the document in Sunday &apos;s referendum . 
&quot; We are threatened in Poland by an atheistic constitution which will cut Poland off from its Christian roots ... from the basic values on which Poland was always based , &quot; Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski thundered in a debate this month . 
the referendum provides a foretaste -- if not a clear test of strength -- for parliamentary elections due in September when the union-led , pro-Church Solidarity Election Action ( AWS ) hopes to supplant the ruling former communists , in power since 1993 . 
it also provides graphic evidence of divisions still rending much of Polish society since the communist period . 
for the right , underrepresented in parliament , the draft approved in a compromise between the ruling parties and two centre or leftist opposition groups in the legislature is galling because ex-communists are its main authors . 
it is a harsh irony for Solidarity that the party rooted in the communist system should be sponsoring a constitution that starts with a reminder that in 1989 Poland recovered the sovereign democratic right to decide its fate . 
the right , asserting historic ties between the Catholic faith of most Poles and their national identity , wants a constitution that clearly invokes God and accepts that Christian principles take precedence over man-made law . 
an alternative draft which Solidarity has drawn up contains , for example , a clause protecting life from conception to death , which would overrule a recent law passed by the secular-minded left liberalising abortion rules . 
Parliament &apos;s version tries to make room for everyone . 
&quot; We , the Polish Nation , all citizens of the Republic , equally those believing in God as the source of truth , justice , goodness and beauty and those not sharing that faith and drawing these universal values from other sources ... &quot; reads the constitution , which separates Church and State . 
the Church , preparing for a major 11-day visit to his native Poland by Pope John Paul ll , has strayed from its original resolve not to get involved and has told voters it has strong moral reservations about the constitution . 
public approval of the constitution could be a sobering sign of the waning influence of the Church in a country where 90 per cent of the population is Catholic . 
the right voices various objections to the draft , on which the electorate will be asked to vote &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no &quot; without the choice of commenting on Solidarity &apos;s version . 
for example , Solidarity alleges that a section permitting Poland by treaty to surrender some state functions to international organisations -- designed to ease its entry into the European Union -- unacceptably limits national sovereignty . 
opinion polls predict that voters will approve the constitution . 
sociologists say a longing to end uncertainty on the issue may lead many to approve the document even if they identify with Solidarity traditions . 
solidarity leaders say a referendum defeat would not herald a setback in the parliamentary elections and would merely indicate they had not yet mobilised their supporters . 
this view is backed by pre-election opinion surveys showing the AWS about level with the ruling ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance ( SLD ) , each with 20 to 30 percent . 
Poland adopted Europe &apos;s first democratic constitution on May 3 , 1791 , just before the country was dismembered by foreign powers for more than a century , and the issue arouses strong passions . 
if the present constitution fails to pass , the country would continue with its makeshift interim constitution , cobbled together after 1989 , until the next parliament is able to agree on a new version . 
the ex-communists , now reformed as pro-Western social democrats , say a referendum defeat for the draft constitution would show the world that Poles are unable to settle their affairs eight years after democracy was restored . 
even the constitution &apos;s authors admit it is ungainly . 
they concede the compromise struck in parliament means everyone has some reservations about some of its 243 articles . 
but its backers , who include President Aleksander Kwasniewski and centrist opposition leader Tadeusz Mazowiecki , a Catholic intellectual , say it reflects the country &apos;s diversity . 
&quot; Poland needs a constitution . 
everyone will give something up so we can all gain , &quot; Kwasniewski told a radio interviewer . 
he argued , for example , that it leaves room for a future parliament to tighten abortion rules if the majority wants . 
the proposed constitution guarantees civil and economic liberties and ensures the parliamentary system with proportional voting . 
some economists say Poland cannot afford the social provisions which outline a welfare state guaranteeing free , publicly-funded basic health care , free basic education and a minimum wage , while obliging the government to curb unemployment and to stimulate housing construction . 
but the draft wins applause for capping the public debt at 60 percent of gross domestic product and forbidding the government to finance the budget deficit through the central bank . 
the constitution would slightly weaken the president by allowing parliament to overturn his veto by three-fifths of votes in the lower house rather than the present two-thirds . 
but it gives him greater authority to appoint key figures , such as army chiefs and senior judges . 
for Lech Walesa , who led Solidarity before 1989 , and was Poland &apos;s first democratically-elected president from 1990 until his 1995 defeat by Kwasniewski , a central flaw is that it fails to usher in a presidential system allowing decisive rule . 
&quot; I ... am going to vote against the parliamentary draft of the constitution and will urge everyone to do the same , &quot; he told Reuters in his home city of Gdansk .
