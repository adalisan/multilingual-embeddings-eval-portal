tough-talking Russian ex-general Alexander Lebed says he is coming to President Bill Clinton &apos;s inauguration , but it was not clear who invited him . 
Lebed has been touting himself as a potential successor to ailing Russian President Boris Yeltsin , leading the pro-Yeltsin U.S. government to keep him at arms length . 
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton did not invite Lebed and suggested he was a guest of the Joint inaugural Committee , made up of leaders of Congress . 
not so , said committee spokesman Eric Ruff , who was engulfed by a flood of press phone calls about Lebed . 
he said it was unclear who invited Lebed . 
the gravel-voiced general has said he was invited but he did not say by whom . 
&quot; We didn &apos;t invite him , &quot; Ruff said . 
&quot; The Joint inaugural Committee didn &apos;t invite him . 
that doesn &apos;t preclude a member of Congress from giving him a ticket or a group of tickets to someone who might give a ticket to Mr. 
Lebed . 
all 535 members of Congress are allotted tickets for Monday &apos;s inaugural ceremony . 
&quot; If he &apos;s been invited , as he apparently has been , it came from an allotment from an individual member of Congress , &quot; another White House spokesman , Barry Toiv , said . 
what does the White House think about that ? 
&quot; Congress is free to invite whoever Congress believes is appropriate , &quot; McCurry said .
