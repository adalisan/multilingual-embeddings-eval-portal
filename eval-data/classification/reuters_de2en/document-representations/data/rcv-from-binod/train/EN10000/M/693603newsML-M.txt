shares were seen easing on 
Friday after U.S. shares edged down overnight and Nokia closed 
in New York lower than in Helsinki , brokers said ; but they 
expected trade to be hesitant . 
adding that some investors may hold off until the U.S. Federal 
reserve &apos;s policy-making meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday . 
UPM-Kymmene was expected to stay lively -- 
although it looked unlikely to escape the softer trend -- after 
selling a big chunk of Nokia this week , fuelling 
speculation that it was looking for acquisitions , brokers said . 
Nokia alone was seen dragging the index , after it ended at 
about 383.50 in New York , 4.50 markka below its Helsinki close . 
brokers said Raisio looked set to stay on a 
downward trend after recent volatility and a sharp drop on 
Thursday , but one noted bargain-hunters could always move 
in after sharp falls , like Thursday &apos;s .
