Pakistan &apos;s sacked prime minister Benazir Bhutto took her fight against her dismissal to the Supreme Court on Wednesday , filing a petition that contained blistering criticism of her nemesis , President Farooq Leghari . 
the 42-page petition , written by Senator Aitzaz Ahsan , argued that Leghari &apos;s action in sacking Bhutto &apos;s three-year-old government on November 5 had been illegal and unconstitutional . 
it said Leghari believed that Bhutto &apos;s husband , Asif Ali Zardari , had leaked evidence of the president &apos;s alleged links to a crooked land deal that the opposition used against him . 
the petition said Bhutto had assured her former ally Leghari , who has denied any wrongdoing , that neither she nor Zardari had released any such evidence . 
nevertheless , it said , &quot; he became bitter and gradually became hostile and adversarial &quot; . 
Leghari , in poor health since Saturday , was not available for comment on the petition . 
he has made no public statement since addressing the nation on the day he removed Bhutto . 
&quot; We should win if the court simply goes by past precedents , including the Nawaz Sharif judgement , &quot; Ahsan told Reuters shortly before the petition was filed on Bhutto &apos;s behalf . 
the Supreme Court reinstated a government led by Sharif , leader of the Pakistan Muslim League , in 1993 , a few weeks after then president Ghulam Ishaq Khan had dismissed it . 
when he removed Bhutto &apos;s government , Leghari issued a nine-point charge-sheet that included accusations of corruption , nepotism , misrule , undermining the judiciary , bringing the army and presidency into disrepute and letting the security forces kill thousands of people in cold blood in Karachi and elsewhere . 
Bhutto &apos;s petition tried to refute the charges point by point and to show that none of them constituted legal grounds for Leghari &apos;s action , which it said came from a &quot; vindictive mind &quot; . 
it cited the president &apos;s decision to lodge a Supreme Court challenge to Bhutto &apos;s powers to appoint judges on September 21 , the day after her brother Murtaza Bhutto was killed in Karachi . 
two days later , Leghari sent a message to parliament , without consulting Bhutto , urging it to act against corruption . 
the petition said the timing of the president &apos;s moves showed &quot; callous indifference to the grief and agony which was being suffered by the petitioner ( Bhutto ) &quot; . 
Bhutto &apos;s was the fourth government to be overturned by a president in less than nine years . 
the Supreme Court has upheld none of the previous dismissals , although the Lahore High Court endorsed the removal of Bhutto &apos;s first government in 1990 . 
former human rights minister Iqbal Haider rejected the idea that this time the court might be prejudiced against Bhutto because of her wrangling with the judiciary earlier this year . 
&quot; When it comes to judgement , one has to hear cases without favour or fear , &quot; he told Reuters . 
Bhutto , 43 , has voiced confidence that the court will restore the National Assembly and her government within a month . 
Ahsan , a member of Bhutto &apos;s Pakistan People &apos;s Party ( PPP ) , contended in the petition that Leghari &apos;s dissolution of the National Assembly ( lower house ) had been &quot; wholly without lawful authority , unconstitutional ( and ) arbitrary &quot; . 
Leghari , 56 , used a controversial article of the constitution , introduced by former military ruler General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1985 , to dismiss the assembly . 
when he took office in 1993 after Bhutto nominated him for the presidency , Leghari vowed never to use his constitutional powers to dismiss an elected government . 
after sacking Bhutto , he named 80-year-old Meraj Khalid as prime minister of a caretaker government charged with supervising a parliamentary election set for February 3 .
