CSCE cocoa futures ended lower for the sixth consecutive session Thursday , as a late sell-off by commodity funds dragged the key March contract to its lowest settlement in over nine months , traders said . 
March delivery fell $ 19 a tonne to $ 1,333 , its lowest close since March 21 , after ranging between $ 1,359 to $ 1,331 . 
on the continuous weekly chart , today &apos;s settlement was the weakest in a month . 
Second-month May slipped $ 16 to $ 1,358 , while the back months finished down $ 14 to $ 15 . 
turnover was heavy at an estimated 13,722 lots , up from Thursday &apos;s official tally of 11,422 lots . 
prudential Securities analyst Arthur Stevenson said today &apos;s downturn was fueled by a combination of technically driven and currency-linked selling . 
&quot; The market was hammered by currency considerations , &quot; said Stevenson . 
&quot; And the March contract dipped under a long-term sideways trend . 
the U.S. dollar &apos;s strength against the British pound spurred some selling in favor of sterling-denominated London cocoa . 
traders said once March cocoa slipped beneath key support at $ 1,345- $ 1,342 , fund selling accelerated . 
they said March should now be well supported at $ 1,322 , its life-of-contract low . 
to the upside , resistance was seen near $ 1,350 . 
on the week , New York &apos;s March contract has fallen $ 49 , or about 3.5 percent . 
traders said disappointing European fourth quarter grind figures reported this week set the bearish tone . 
the 1996 fourth quarter Dutch grind rose 3.90 percent versus the same 1995 period , to 97,273 tonnes . 
industry sources had expected about a five percent rise . 
the German cocoa grind dropped by 21.2 percent to 56,254.7 tonnes in fourth quarter 1996 from 71,375.0 tonnes in the same period in 1995 . 
analysts estimated the data to be down by some two percent from comparable 1995 . 
the U.K. figures were slightly better-than-expected , but still lower than a year ago . 
U.K. fourth quarter 1996 cocoa grind fell by 3.3 percent to 45,147 tonnes when compared with 46,688 in the same period in 1995 . 
industry sources had expected the grind to decline by up to ten percent . 
the U.S. 1996 fourth quarter grind will be released Friday , January 17 . 
prudential &apos;s Stevenson estimated the figure would come in three to four percent lower versus the 1995 fourth quarter grindings of 93,320 tonnes .
