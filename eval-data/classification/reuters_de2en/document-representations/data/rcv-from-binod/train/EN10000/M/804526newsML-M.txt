the Australian dollar was showing that despite upside rebuffs last week it still had good support , and it was expected to hold above US $ 0.74 on a day when the U.S. dollar and stockmarket fall would dominate regional trading . 
traders said the fact the dollar had held above US $ 0.74 in offshore trading was a positive sign , although it also appeared to be lacking the buying strength to take it through US $ 0.75 , leaving the unit to trade in the broader US $ 0.73-75 band it has held since early July . 
&quot; The fact that the Aussie has held up here after Friday &apos;s selloff is mildly positive , &quot; one trader said . 
traders will be watching to see if the U.S. investment bank that was a solid buyer last week remains on the bid . 
interest rate moves remain the major influence on the market this week , although with no data of note scheduled for Monday , trade was likely to be subdued . 
the first key piece of information this week is the Reserve Bank Bulletin on Tuesday , which will contain the RBA &apos;s quarterly assessment on monetary policy , although the RBA Governor &apos;s speech last week has taken the edge of this somewhat . 
data on wage enterprise bargains in the second quarter are also due this week , with the rate cut bulls looking for signs of moderation after last week &apos;s soft average weekly earnings data . 
a danger for the dollar was that its strong rally last week -- it rose from a two year low of US $ 0.7295 on August 8 to a high of US $ 0.7483 last Thursday -- may have led to many short positions being squared , and thinned support below US $ 0.7380 . 
the market will keep an eye on Tuesday &apos;s U.S. FOMC meeting , where a change in rates is not expected , and on Thursday &apos;s Bundesbank meeting , where traders are are not as confident that rates will be held steady . 
the regional focus will be on reaction to Friday &apos;s fall in the U.S. dollar and stockmarket . 
the Dow Jones Index fell by 247.37 points , its second largest point fall , on fears about the corporate profit outlook . 
the fall was not helped by a weakener U.S. dollar , which fell on fears of higher German rates . 
the U.S. dollar held this bias in early trade in Asia , easing to 1.8143 / 48 marks and 117.00 / 10 yen from New York closes of 1.8185 / 95 and 1.1739 / 44 . 
that fed through to Australian dollar cross rates . 
the Aussie opened at 1.3453 / 75 marks and 86.80 / 90 yen , down from Friday &apos;s late 1.3697 / 14 and 87.86 / 96 .
