term lifters of Yemen &apos;s Masila crude in Japan and South Korea said on Wednesday that Yemen has revised down the price of its Masila crude for the fourth quarter by 10 cents to dated Brent minus 55 cents . 
one South Korean trader said Yemen &apos;s new offer , which was faxed overnight , was the same as his firm &apos;s initial bid , and that it believed this was the end of negotiations for Masila for the fourth quarter . 
asked if he had sent a reply accepting the latest offer , he said there was no need to do so . 
&quot; It &apos;s a deal done , &quot; he said . 
but Japanese traders said they had not yet reached a decision . 
they said Yemen had asked that a response be made by 7 p.m. ( 1600 GMT ) Yemen time on Wednesday . 
Yemeni oil officials could not immediately be reached for comment . 
Yemen &apos;s latest compromise to cut the Masila price failed to appease many East Asian traders , who continued to maintain that the price was still too high . 
&quot; It &apos;s still not good economics , &quot; a second South Korean trader said . 
but he said his firm would probably accept the latest offer . 
many other Asian term buyers said last week they were prepared to drop fourth-quarter contracts if prices were not lowered . 
last week , Yemen said it had rolled over its official fourth-quarter Masila crude oil price to maintain it at dated Brent minus 45 cents . 
term holders -- whose initial bids to Yemen had ranged from dated Brent minus 55 to 60 cents -- put off making a decision on whether they would accept the price . 
the most recent sales of Masila crude in the spot market have been at steep discounts of up to 15 cents to the official selling price . 
traders said Masila crude is difficult to sell in Asia because the price is linked to Brent and not crudes such as Oman and Dubai , which are regarded as benchmarks in Asia . 
Brent-linked crudes lose price competitiveness in Asia when the price of Brent rises in comparison with Oman and Dubai .
