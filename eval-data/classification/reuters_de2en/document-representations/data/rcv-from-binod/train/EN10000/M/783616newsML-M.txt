Shenzhen &apos;s hard currency B share index fell slightly during the Wednesday morning session on a technical correction after rises over the past three sessions , analysts said . 
the index lost 0.90 point or 0.68 percent to 130.55 on turnover of HK $ 21 million . 
the domestic A share index declined 1.37 points or 0.33 percent to 411.86 on turnover of 1.5 billion yuan . 
&quot; But the market still lacks clear direction . 
analysts said the B share index was likely to move within a narrow range in the coming sessions . 
&quot; sharp declines in the B share market are unlikely , &quot; an analyst at China Guotai Securities said . 
the stock was the morning &apos;s most active and it finished down HK $ 0.10 at a session low of HK $ 5.60 on volume of 1.3 million shares . 
the issue rose strongly earlier this week on institutional bargain hunting after its previous heavy losses , brokers said . 
on the A share market , weakness in market leader Shenzhen Development Bank added to the index decline , brokers said . 
the issue fell 0.13 yuan to 33.97 yuan on volume of 700,740 shares . 
brokers said the share has performed poorly since the bank last month forecast slower than expected earnings growth for 1997 .
