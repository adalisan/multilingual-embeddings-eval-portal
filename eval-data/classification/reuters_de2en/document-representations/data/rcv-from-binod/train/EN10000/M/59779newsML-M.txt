fears that Beijing will tighten up on domestic investors trading in B shares are continuing to pull down Shanghai &apos;s foreign-currency stock market and the index could fall further in the near future , brokers said on Tuesday . 
the B share index has been on a downward trend for the past six weeks , mainly on rumours of new restrictions , with securities authorities declining to comment on the issue . 
poor company interim results posted in July and August also contributed to the falls , the brokers said . 
the Shanghai B share index has lost 3.161 points or 5.94 percent since August 12 . 
it closed on Tuesday at 50.059 points , down 0.68 percent on the day . 
China &apos;s securities rules limit B share trading to foreign nationals and residents of Hong Kong , Macau and Taiwan . 
but brokers estimate that , in practice , about 50 percent of trading on the two markets , in Shanghai and Shenzhen , is now done by locals . 
&quot; Rumours about the crackdown have been the most important factor , &quot; said an analyst with a major Chinese securities house . 
&quot; Since the securities authorities reaffirmed a ban on trading in B shares by domestic investors in June , rumours that concrete measures will be taken shortly have circulated on the market from time to time . 
&quot; Some rumours say a set of rules have been been drawn up and will be announced shortly , &quot; he added . 
&quot; Nobody knows whether the rumours will turn out to be true or not , &quot; said a Shanghai-based investment analyst with a Western brokerage . 
&quot; But if they prove true , it will kill the market . 
in late June the CSRC issued an urgent circular ordering the country &apos;s two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen to ban Chinese citizens from opening B share trading accounts to stop repeated violations of rules governing B share trading . 
the circular was issued after B share trading on the two markets surged as more and more domestic investors entered the market . 
but B share volumes have been very light for the past two years on weak market sentiment partly due to poor profit performances by listed companies , a broker said . 
&quot; The 1996 interim results were very disappointing , &quot; said a foreign investment analyst . 
&quot; This was another reason for the recent falls . 
but after a few weeks of falls , the poor results have been factored into share prices , &quot; he added . 
&quot; If there is no fresh stimulus , the Shanghai market will consolidate in a narrow range . 
Shenzhen &apos;s B share market has been little affected , partly because of better performances by the companies listed there , brokers said . 
the Shenzhen B share index edged up to 87.93 points on Tuesday from 87.06 on August 12 .
