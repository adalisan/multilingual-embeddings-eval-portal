an international aid agency said on Monday it pulled out of a province in north Burundi because of insecurity and the government said dialogue with various groups -- excluding the Hutu rebels -- would start this month . 
Medecins Sans Frontieres ( Doctors Without Borders ) officials said their staff were evacuated from Kayanza province because of the insecurity but declined to give details of the problems . 
a western diplomat said the aid agency had received threats from Tutsi militiamen against its staff so they left on Friday . 
in the capital Bujumbura , officials said the government would start a national debate on Burundi &apos;s future on January 27 . 
the long-awaited talks will exclude rebels of the Hutu majority . 
the officials said 60 participants from Burundi factions would be invited and the debate would cover the causes of war , peace and reconciliation in Africa and the nature of Burundi &apos;s conflict . 
the leader of the Tutsi-dominated Uprona party welcomed the proposed debate . 
the Hutu-dominated Frodebu party said it was impossible because of insecurity in the country but a ceasefire and dialogue were essential to end to massacres of civilians . 
a national debate was integral to U.N. plans for bringing peace to Burundi before a coup by the army last July . 
without rebel participation , analysts say it has little chance of success . 
more than 150,000 people have been killed in Burundi since the killing of its first freely-elected Hutu president in 1993 .
