Mexico &apos;s election authorities Wednesday announced rules for opinion pollsters ahead of key July mid-term elections and said a team of scientists would review the accuracy of the electoral rolls . 
the autonomous Federal Electoral Institute said pollsters would not be allowed to publish their findings in the eight days before the July 6 elections , in which Mexicans will renew the lower house Chamber of Deputies and part of the upper house Senate . 
Mexicans will also vote for the first time to choose a mayor for Mexico City and elect several state governors . 
Mexico City &apos;s mayor has previously always been a presidential appointee . 
Pollsters would also be banned from publishing their findings until all voting in Mexico &apos;s various time zones had ended , the Institute said , and would have to carry out their polls according to methodology approved by the Institute to avoid bias . 
it said it had named a commission of scientists and technical experts to review the electoral roll and the voting lists to be used at each polling booth . 
Mexico &apos;s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party has been in power since 1929 and has frequently been accused of vote-rigging . 
President Ernesto Zedillo , who won August 1994 presidential elections for the pri , has pledged to wipe out vote fraud .
