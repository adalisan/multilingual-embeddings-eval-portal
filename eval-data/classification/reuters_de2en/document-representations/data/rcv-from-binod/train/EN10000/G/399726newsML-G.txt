two United Nations human rights investigators have delayed a visit to Nigeria because authorities have refused to give them full access to prisoners , U.N. sources said on Monday . 
Param Cumaraswamy , special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers , and Bacre Waly Ndiaye , special rapporteur on extrajudicial or arbitrary executions , were due in Lagos at the weekend for a 10-day trip at the invitation of the government . 
the investigators expected full access to detainees and dissidents , which the Nigerian authorities have refused , U.N. sources said . 
the envoys were hoping to visit 19 jailed Ogoni leaders who were close to the executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and also face the death penalty , and Moshood Abiola , the presidential claimant who has been jailed on charges of treason since June 1994 after a previous army government annulled a 1993 presidential poll . 
U.N. sources said an official of the U.N. human rights centre in Geneva was in Nigeria negotiating with the authorities to clarify the terms of reference for the visit . 
Nigeria drew worldwide outrage in November 1995 when it hanged Saro-Wiwa and eight Ogoni minority rights activists after their conviction in the 1994 murder of four pro-government tribal chiefs . 
their trial was judged unfair by international judicial experts , and the defendants had no right to appeal . 
they had been campaigning for compensation for Ogoniland in south-eastern Nigeria for oil extracted there by multinational corporations . 
the 19 Ogoni leaders , said to be detained in poor conditions and in deteriorating health , were followers of Saro-Wiwa and belonged to the Movement to Save the Ogoni People . 
Nigeria will be one of the countries in the dock when the main U.N. human rights forum opens its annual six-week meeting in Geneva on March 10 , according to U.N. sources .
