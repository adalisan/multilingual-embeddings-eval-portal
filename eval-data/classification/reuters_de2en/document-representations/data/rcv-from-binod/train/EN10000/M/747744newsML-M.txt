Taiwan &apos;s central bank issued T $ 3 billion in one-month negotiable certificates of deposit on Tuesday at an average yield of 7.308 percent , a central bank official said . 
the range of the bids was between 7.230 and 7.375 percent . 
the issue coincides with a renewed bull run in Taiwan &apos;s stock market , where the index has pushed to a series of seven-year highs in recent weeks . 
Central bank chief Sheu Yuan-dong said last week the bank would not adjust monetary policy merely to cool Taiwan &apos;s red-hot stock market , saying such moves were no &quot; cure all &quot; in the face of concerns of overheating . 
but the central bank &apos;s repeated issuance of NCDs has been seen widely as a bid to dampen the sizzling stock market by slowing what have been huge flows of liquidity out of the money market and into the bourse .
