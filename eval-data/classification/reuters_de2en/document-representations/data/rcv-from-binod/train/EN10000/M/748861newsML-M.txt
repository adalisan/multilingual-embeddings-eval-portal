the Polish zloty recaptured more lost ground on Wednesday , strengthening against the basket for the fourth straight trading day after a steep fall as foreign and domestic players lengthened zloty positions , dealers said . 
dealers said that small sums moved the shallow market and that foreign investors actively bought zlotys on Wednesday . 
&quot; Overall foreign capital flew into Poland today , which bodes well for the zloty in the near-term . 
some say the zloty may even rise to around parity levels , &quot; said Mateusz Bieniek , dealer at Societe Generale in Warsaw . 
however , others said the zloty stood to loose some ground . 
&quot; The potential for further zloty gains is not large because Poland has a widening trade deficit ... and the economy has been hit by heavy floods , &quot; said Leszek Szafranek from Bank Slaski SA . 
&quot; The zloty may soon return to three percent below parity . 
the zloty closed at -1.09 / -1.20 percent from parity , up from Tuesday &apos;s -1.90 / -2.02 . 
on Friday it was at -3.29 percent . 
it closed at 3.4360 / 80 to the dollar , against 3.4536 / 65 on Tuesday and at 1.8770 / 05 to the mark , against 1.9010 / 40 . 
dealers said the zloty received an additional boost by the IMF &apos;s favourable assessment of Poland &apos;s fundementals despite losses from floods in southern Poland over the last two weeks . 
&quot; Although the present level of the current account deficit ( 4-5 percent of GDP in 1997 ) is not a problem , a further significant deterioration would make Poland vulnerable to sudden shifts in confidence and resulting economic and financial disruptions , &quot; the International Monetary Fund said . 
the IMF also said the recent zloty fall created room for an interest rate rise , needed to contain credit growth , and that large zloty swings within the currency &apos;s present 14-percent trading band should limit hot capital flow pressures . 
on Wednesday the central bank rejected all bids at its reverse repo tender , but pushed up yields on its 91-day bills . 
some dealers said that today &apos;s rejection of all reverse repo bids may have been a signal that the central bank was in no hurry to increase nominal rates , now at 22 and 25 percent . 
&quot; The central bank will not increase rates during the summer months , but perhaps around the autumn , &quot; said Piotr Schmidt , dealer at Pekao SA . 
last week the central banker said there was a very real possibility on an official interest rate rise . 
overnight rates closed at 22.60 / 23.10 percent , against 23.55 / 23.65 at opening and tomorrow / next were at 22.70 / 23.20 against Tuesday &apos;s 23.65 / 24.05 . 
the 91-day NBP-bill yield rose 0.08 to 22.58 percent .
