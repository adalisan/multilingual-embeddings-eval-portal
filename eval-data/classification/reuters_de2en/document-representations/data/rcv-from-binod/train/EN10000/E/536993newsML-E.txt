the British Chambers of Commerce said on Thursday that it would like to see a 1p rise in the standard rate of UK income tax in order to dampen consumer demand . 
&quot; We said when income tax was cut by the Chancellor in the budget that it was a penny too far . 
we &apos;d like to see that reversed , &quot; said Ian Peters , BCC deputy director general . 
both major parties contesting the May 1 election have committed themselves to not increasing income tax . 
but the BCC said a tax rise would be by far the best policy &quot; Politicians always have a choice and they will have to live with the consequences of their actions , &quot; Peters said . 
analysts expect the next government to cool the economy down with interest rate rises rather than tax increases .
