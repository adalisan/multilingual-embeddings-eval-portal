shares eased in low turnover on Lithuania &apos;s bourse on Monday and dealers were uncertain if things would pick up soon . 
Group A shares slid 7.70 points to 1,981.83 points and the official index dipped 1.29 points to 920.86 points . 
&quot; Today , the market was very sleepy , &quot; said Tomas Andrejauskas , a broker with Suprema . 
&quot; It was a normal Monday , &quot; said Saulius Merkys , a broker with Vilfima . 
Central market turnover was down to 402,065 litas from 480,000 litas . 
dealers said that there were no red rags to attract bulls at the moment and its was difficult to say what direction the struggling market would move in . 
the market has sputtered since a bull run in January and analysts cite low liquidity and a lack of big , attractive companies among the reasons why it has failed to mirror trends elsewhere in Europe . 
Hermis Bank was down slightly on the central market , at 174.00 litas from 175.10 litas in trade of 68,000 litas . 
the bank &apos;s shares were more active in block trading , turning over 688,000 litas at 172.00 litas a share . 
brokers say Hermis shares have been active recently due to the bank &apos;s new 23 million litas share issue and say Hermis shares are comparatively cheap . 
Vilniaus Bank shares saw 352,500 litas turnover in block trades at 235.00 litas a share .
