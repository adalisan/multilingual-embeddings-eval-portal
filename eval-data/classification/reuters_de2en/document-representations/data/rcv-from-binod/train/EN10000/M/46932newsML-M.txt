the Fed in its so-called Beige Book report said the economy seemed to be expanding moderately with no clear sign of higher inflation , although wages appeared to be on the upswing . 
&quot; Inflation indicators ... were varied and generally inconclusive , although there appears to be greater upward pressure on wages than on prices , &quot; said the Beige Book summary prepared by the Cleveland Fed . 
it was based on information collected before Sept . 4 in the 12 Fed districts and will be used when central bank policymakers meet on Sept . 24 to plot interest-rate strategy .

the bond market held steady with the 30-year Treasury bond &apos;s yield at Tuesday &apos;s close of 7.11 percent . 
&quot; The question is how will the Fed react , &quot; Johnson said . 
&quot; The report shows upward pressure on wages and also , even though none of the 12 Fed districts saw inflationary pressures subsiding , one of the districts said &apos; trace increases are expected to intensify &apos; . 
he added that , &quot; The Fed will want to sent a strong signal that they are not ignoring these events &quot; .
