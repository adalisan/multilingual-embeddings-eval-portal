June IPE was trading four cents lower at $ 19.47 , up from an earlier low of $ 19.36 at 1516 GMT , but struggling to push into positive territory . 
June gas oil was trading $ 2.0 higher at $ 172.75 a tonne . 
&quot; It &apos;s not very interesting at the moment , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; It &apos;s stuck in range . 
traders attributed earlier losses to news of crude run cuts at a major European refinery , continued fallout from Tuesday &apos;s bearish American Petroleum Institute ( API ) U.S. stock data and a virtually unchanged Brent loading programme in June . 
European products traders said on Thursday that Texaco had cut crude throughput at the Nerefco refinery in Rotterdam by 10 percent for the whole of May which means a 20 percent cut in runs for the second half of May . 
meanwhile , the June Brent loading programme announced on Thursday morning gave little support to the market . 
the equivalent of 38.4 cargoes will be loaded in June against 41.8 cargoes in May . 
some players had been hoping for a lower programme . 
a protest by fishermen around Venezuela &apos;s Lake Maracaibo shipping channel which threatened to paralyse traffic in the area for three hours from 1300 GMT had limited results . 
shipping agents said the channels had stayed open despite the protest . 
&quot; The fisherman protest at the Maracaibo Lake in Venezuela is worth watching because one million bpd passes through it , &quot; said GNI &apos;s Leslie Nicholas in his daily report . 
the fishermen are attempting to draw attention to their $ 292.5 million claim against the owners of the Nissos Amorgos tanker which spilled 25,000 barrels of crude into the channel on February 28 .
