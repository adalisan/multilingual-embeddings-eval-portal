government statistician Len Cook said on Thursday that Statistics New Zealand is close to agreeing with the Reserve Bank over the publication of an underlying inflation rate . 
the underlying rate excludes interest rate changes , one-off government charges above a specified level and overseas price shocks . 
Cook and Reserve Bank Governor Don brash on Wednesday briefed key exporter groups who had convened to discuss how the calculation of inflation affected price stability , monetary policy and the exchange rate . 
&quot; At the moment we are looking pretty positively at the issue , &quot; Cook told Reuters . 
SNZ and the RBNZ have discussed the issue over a number of years but failed to agree because of variable factors in the calculation of the underlying rate . 
SNZ is currently reviewing the calculation of the CPI with a decision on the review expected at the end of the year . 
the exporters recommended at their meeting that SNZ publish the underlying rate to improve the credibility of the data . 
the issue of how price shocks are defined remains a sticking point , Cook said . 
&quot; We are getting closer and closer to that not being such a big deal . 
we &apos;re not sure whether we are there or not but we are closer than we have ever been . 
the differences between the organisations &apos; views don &apos;t appear to be that dramatic . 
Cook expects agreement within a year . 
he said SNZ and RBNZ had whittled away most differences over how government charges could be excluded from the calculation of core , or underlying , inflation . 
&quot; What has become much more important over time , is the time lag between releasing the CPI and the underlying inflation measure , &quot; he said . 
Cook said he had strong reservations about the term &quot; underlying inflation &quot; . 
&quot; If you are subtracting a good number of items from a measure I &apos;m not quite sure what it should be called . 
&quot; The Australian one is clearly labelled as &apos; the Treasury underlying Inflation Measure &apos; . 
it is very clearly ascribed to the Australian Treasury , &quot; he said . 
Cook said the Australian measure removed many items where one-off items could affect the measure and so only included 52 percent of the items in the CPI . 
&quot; In New Zealand we don &apos;t anticipate changes by reducing items that are volatile , we actually make a direct adjustment . 
&quot; It &apos;s how you manage to apply judgements to data before you &apos;ve got them that &apos;s been part of our concern . 
&quot; But that is less of an issue now than it was a couple of year &apos;s ago .
