a bomb rocked a village and fighting was reported in many parts of Sri Lanka on Friday as islanders voted in council elections seen as the first political test for the government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga . 
about 70 violent incidents were reported overnight before polling began at 8,246 stations , the police elections secretariat said . 
the Centre for Monitoring Election Violence , an independent group , said it had recorded about 200 incidents of poll-related violence between Thursday night and Friday . 
most of them were clashes between supporters of the ruling People &apos;s Alliance ( PA ) and the opposition United National Party ( UNP ) , the two main contenders in the election . 
police said 10 people were wounded , four seriously , when a bomb exploded near a polling station in Koswatte village in the northcentral Puttalam district , 50 km ( 30 miles ) from Colombo . 
&quot; A People &apos;s Alliance candidate has complained , accusing United National Party supporters of having thrown the bomb , &quot; an official at the elections secretariat told Reuters . 
UNP spokesman Irvin Weerackody said the party &apos;s polling agents had been driven from election centres by PA activists in several areas , including the capital Colombo . 
&quot; Widespread intimidation of UNP-ers by PA supporters have been reported , &quot; Weerackody said in a statement . 
but Colombo and its suburbs , which have been centres of violence during previous elections , were largely peaceful and saw brisk voting , election workers said . 
&quot; By noon we recorded a 70 percent turnout , &quot; said S. Subramanium , presiding officer at a polling station in Borella , a district of Colombo . 
&quot; We may get about a 90 percent turnout by the end of day . 
&quot; Colombo is very peaceful . 
there seems to be a feeling of mutual goodwill ( among voters ) towards each other , &quot; said government minister A.H.M. 
in Colombo , offices closed early to enable people to vote . 
banks were open only for an hour in the morning and trading hours were curtailed at the stock exchange . 
office workers rushed to get home as speculation was rife that the government would impose a curfew soon after polling ended at 4 p.m. ( 1000 GMT ) . 
&quot; We are counting on a high voter turnout , &quot; said opposition leader and former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe after casting his vote in Colombo . 
&quot; If it is a free and fair election , the UNP will win . 
the UNP said earlier this week it was concerned that violence during the campaign would keep voters away . 
some 10 million Sri Lankans are eligible to vote to elect 3,567 representatives to 238 local bodies . 
the election Office says more than 100,000 public servants manned 8,246 polling stations across the island except in the northern and eastern provinces where government troops are fighting Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) rebels .
