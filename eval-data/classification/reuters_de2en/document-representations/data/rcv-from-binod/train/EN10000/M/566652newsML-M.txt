U.S. municipal bonds were flat to slightly softer in late morning trade on Wednesday as the market looked to Treasury bonds to set direction ahead of the auction of $ 12 billion of 10-year notes . 
the latest data from the Federal Reserve &apos;s Beige Book weakened cash Treasury bonds , as the report showed a 2.0 percent gain in first quarter productivity , exceeding predictions for a 2.4 percent increase seen in a Reuters consensus survey of economists . 
the rise was offset by a 2.7 percent Labor cost rise , which also topped forecasts for a 1.0 percent gain . 
Fixed-income markets rallied sharply last week as economic reports showed the economy , though growing more swiftly than expected was not triggering inflation , and prices have hung on to most of their gains . 
new offerings of municipal bonds were expected to add up to nearly $ 4.1 billion this week , and traders said some of the big deals seen on Tuesday had attracted a fair amount of demand , predicting buyers likely would stick around unless the market turned down sharply . 
&quot; The deals have done pretty well . 
there &apos;s been good demand from the property and casualty companies , as well as the insurance companies , and bond funds . 
I don &apos;t think the deals are tremendously over-subscribed , but certainly there &apos;s enough demand to take on what we see , &quot; a trader said . 
two key deals slated for sale are a $ 450 million sale of revenue bonds by Puerto Rico Electric Power through Bear Stearns , and a $ 343 million sale by Orange County , Florida , School Board , through PaineWebber . 
both offerings are expected to go smoothly as the two issuers are considered desirable . 
traders said there were few bid wanted lists being circulated , but noted activity had yet to fully start . 
while supplies are rising for new issues , the reverse is true for the secondary market , as the Standard and Poor &apos;s Corp Blue List slipped to $ 887 million , a fairly lean level . 
in the secondary market , Dade County , Florida , Water and sewer System revenues of 2026 , which pay a 5-1 / 4 percent coupon , were bid at 5.74 percent , net , up two basis points . 
and Denver , Colorado City and County , Airport revenues of 2025 , which pay a 5-1 / 2 percent coupon , were bid at 5.82 percent , net , down one basis point . 
in debt futures , June Treasury bond futures fell 15 ticks to 109-21 / 32 , while June municipal bonds edged down eight ticks to 115-1 / 32 .
