gasoline prices tumbled at NYMEX pulling crude oil down after the same industry reports showed supplies were building . 
cotton prices reached a 3-1 / 2 month high on crop problems in Texas and the former Soviet Union , while wheat tumbled on rumours Egypt cancelled a purchase . 
spot heating oil peaked at 73.15 cents a gallon Wednesday , the highest since 74.40 set late in January 1991 . 
&quot; heating oil was definitely the leader , while crude and gasoline traded separately , &quot; said Jack McIntyre , market strategist with MCM Trade Watch . 
heating oil for November delivery settled 1.22 cents higher at 71.98 cents a gallon after peaking at 73.15 . 
November crude settled nine cents lower at $ 24.05 a barrel , and November gasoline settled 0.40 cent lower at 62.42 cents a gallon .

the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) said Wednesday that for the week ended September 27 , distillate stocks , which include heating oil , dropped 800,000 barrels . 
the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) reported heating oil stocks were 17.9 million barrels below a year ago , with most of the shortfall in northeastern United States , the world &apos;s largest market for heating oil . 
gains in heating oil had been sharpened by a rumour of a fire at the Punta Cardon refinery of Venezuela &apos;s Maraven , a unit of state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA ( PDVSA ) , but a PDVSA spokesman later denied the rumour . 
meanwhile , traders said poor demand is fattening gasoline stocks , with the API reporting gasoline inventories rising 2.27 million barrels and the EIA data showing an even higher build of 4.2 million barrels . 
cotton prices hit a 3-1 / 2-month high at New York &apos;s Cotton Exchange partly because rain and frigid weather may hurt the Texas crop and frigid weather threatened the crop in the former Soviet Union . 
Unseasonably cold , rainy weather slowed cotton maturity and harvest in the Texas Plains during the week ended Sunday and lowered the quality of the lint , the state &apos;s agricultural statistics service said . 
the crop was 18 percent harvested versus 25 percent normally . 
actively traded December cotton rose 1.59 cents to 77.75 cents per lb .
