NYCE cotton futures closed sharply lower amid mixed late-session selling as a steep drop in soybean futures added pressure , industry sources said . 
cotton futures fell to their lows just before the close as the funds joined the trade and some locals in liquidating long positions , traders said . 
the move down filled a gap on the charts between 76.30 and 76.10 cents basis May . 
&quot; The locals went short in search of stops under the market , the specs jumped on the bandwagon and then beans went down , &quot; a trader said . 
Most-active May cotton eased 1.50 cents to close at 76.15 cents a lb , having ranged from 77.35 to 76.00 cents . 
the back months finished 1.28 to 0.25 lower . 
volume reached an estimated 18,000 lots compared to Tuesday &apos;s official 20,037 lots . 
nearby support basis May was seen at 76.00 and then at 75.75 , slightly below the 40-day moving average of 75.77 . 
additional losses are anticipated as the market remains in a technically precarious position . 
analysts noted that the speculators hold a hefty net long position . 
Monday &apos;s runup to the recent high of 78.25 cents in May amid record volume of 33,291 lots , they said , could set the market up for a steep fall . 
fundamental pressure will come from Tuesday &apos;s revised estimate for U.S. exports . 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture raised exports to 6.8 million bales from its previous forecast of 6.5 million bales . 
but prices are likely to retreat if the U.S. is to reach its new export target . 
&quot; We entirely shut off export enquiries over 76.00 cents , &quot; the trader said . 
Cleveland , a cotton marketing specialist with Mississippi State University , said that flooding in the mid-South could ultimately lift prices in the longer term if growers are unable to plant cotton . 
the market may have a better idea of the 1997 / 98 crop potential after the USDA issues its first official estimate of planted cotton area , on March 31 . 
signs that the U.S. may be importing soybeans from Brazil prompted a fall in CBOT soybeans futures .
