Zaire &apos;s armed forces chief of staff said on Wednesday that the army was fighting a war imposed on it but would fight on until ordered to do otherwise . 
at the same time , General Mahele Lieko Bokoungo urged the government to take care of soldiers needs and leave the army to make its own logistics arrangements . 
&quot; The Zairean Armed Forces ( FAZ ) , engaged in a war which is imposed on them , will continue with it until receiving contrary orders , &quot; he said in a statement read by a fellow officer at a news conference . 
Mahele , appointed by Zaire &apos;s ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko in December , went on to urge his notoriously ill-disciplined soldiers to refrain from looting . 
army looting at regular intervals during Mobutu &apos;s three decades in power has alientated local Zaireans and now works in favour of rebels advancing in the east and south . 
&quot; You , those in power , take care of the fate of our soldiers , &quot; Mahele &apos;s statement said . 
&quot; He demanded that the acquisition and management of logistics of the armed forces should henceforth be the responsibility of the army , &quot; it added . 
Mahele &apos;s remarks were the first since a January 20 army counter-offensive flopped in the face of rebels advances on several fronts .
