Slobodan Milosevic &apos;s hard-line Montenegrin allies punished their moderate prime minister on Tuesday for his bold criticism of the Serbian president . 
in a setback for pro-Western reformers in the smaller of Yugoslavia &apos;s two republics , the Main Board of the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro voted no confidence in Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic and demanded that he dump his most trusted cabinet allies . 
the 35-year-old Djukanovic promptly resigned as vice-president of the party and political sources close to him said he would probably quit as prime minister rather than give up his closest fellow reformers . 
&quot; Djukanovic was asked to replace the chief of state security , deputy prime minister , minister of culture and the trade representative in Washington , &quot; Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic told a news conference . 
the four men have backed Djukanovic who heavily criticised Milosevic during the Serbian leader &apos;s three-month battle to reverse opposition successes in local elections . 
Djukanovic &apos;s ouster would be a victory for Milosevic , who has pressed for his resignation for months . 
Montenegro is Serbia &apos;s only remaining partner in what is left of the Yugoslav federation and Djukanovic has pursued an opening to the world separately from Belgrade , which is isolated by an outer wall of sanctions and under Western pressure over human rights . 
Djukanovic enjoys widespread support and most opposition parties applaud his success in putting up to 95 percent of Montenegro &apos;s economy into private hands . 
Milosevic &apos;s Serbia has not even embarked on the privatisation road . 
the three-month long politicial upheaval in Serbia has hurt Montenegro when potential investors shied away from the unstable region . 
Serbian hard-liners in turn accused Djukanovic of corruption , treason for his trips to the United States and of leading the country towards secession . 
Bulatovic said his party will not stray for its pro-Yugoslav course : &quot; There is no alternative road , no alternative programme no alternative solution .
