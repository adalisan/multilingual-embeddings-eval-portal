the following is the text of a press release issued on Thursday by the Russian central bank on the current round of talks between Russia and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , in an unofficial translation by Reuters . 
the press centre of the Bank of Russia states that during the last 10 days , a mission of the International Monetary Fund has been working in Moscow to assess how the Russian Federation is meeting its commitments under the Extended Fund Facility . 
representatives of the IMF , after discussions with representatives of the government and the Bank of Russia , came to the conclusion that as of the end of September , Russia is adhering to key target indicators in the parts of the agreed programme covering monetary and credit policy and the budget deficit , making it possible to keep the inflation rate at a stable and low level . 
at the same time , in the course of discussions on the fulfilment of some other components of the economic programme , the two sides failed to agree on a number of problems . 
this currently prevents the mission from reaching a conclusion . 
in particular , differences of opinion emerged over the temporary timetable for carrying out decisions taken in July-August 1996 which were intended to strengthen budget revenues , as well as over the interpretation of measures adopted by the Government of Russia to defend its domestic alcohol market , and whether the new rules of access of non-residents to the government securities market meet the requirements of Article 8 of the IMF Charter . 
the two sides have agreed to resume discussion of the above-mentioned issues in the first half of November , after the Russian side prepares additional materials which will make it possible to reach agreement on the issues .
