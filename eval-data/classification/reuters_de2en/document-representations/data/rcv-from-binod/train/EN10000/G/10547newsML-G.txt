Moroccan Olympic bronze medallist Salah Hissou produced the run of his life to smash the men &apos;s 10,000 world record on Friday , pushed on by the beat of an African drum and an ecstatic Brussels crowd . 
Hissou ate up the ground of a new track to clock 26 minutes 38.08 seconds at the Brussels grand Prix , slashing 5.45 seconds off the previous mark of 26 : 43.53 set by Ethiopia &apos;s Haile Gebreselassie in the Dutch town of Hengelo in June last year . 
it was the second world record of a superb meeting which saw Russian double Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova break the non-championship women &apos;s 1,000 metres , her second world mark in 10 days . 
after breaking the world mark for the women &apos;s mile in Zurich last Wednesday , Olympic 800 and 1,500 metres champion Masterkova clocked two minutes 28.98 seconds to shave 0.36 seconds off the previous best . 
the Russian powered through a fast last lap to improve on the 2 : 29.34 set by Mozambique &apos;s former world champion Maria Mutola in the same stadium in August last year . 
Mutola pushed the Russian all the way and took second place in 2 : 29.66 . 
like Hissou , an exhausted Masterkova earned a bonus of $ 25,000 for the performance . 
she paid tribute to her rival after the race . 
&quot; That really finished me , &quot; she said . 
she pushed me ... It was a fast track , a terrific atmosphere . 
the Mexican waves in the crowd gave me wings . 
&quot; In the last 400 metres I felt Mutola closing in and that drove me to the decisive extra effort . 
Gebreselassie defeated Hissou to win the 10,000 at the Atlanta Games and was not competing here . 
the 24-year-old Moroccan brought the crowd to their feet when he gritted his teeth on the last lap and forced his way to the line . 
last year , Brussels organisers played African music to spur on the distance racers . 
the athletes liked it so much that they asked for it again . 
it clearly added an extra stride to Hissou . 
afterwards the Moroccan said he could go even faster . 
this was too slow . 
next time I will be on pace for the whole race , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I have achieved my main goal to have a world record . 
now I can &apos;t think of anything but that it could be faster . 
the two records were the highlights of the 20th Ivo Van Damme memorial meeting which saw some superb performances on the new track in front of a capacity 40,000 crowd including great middle-distance names of the past such as Britain &apos;s Sebastian CoE and New Zealander John Walker . 
Dennis Mitchell upstaged a trio of Olympic 100 metres champions , Kenyan Daniel komen produced another historic 3,000 metres and American high hurdler Allen Johnson went within 0.01 seconds of the world record despite damp conditions . 
Mitchell ran 10.03 seconds to take the scalp of Canada &apos;s Olympic sprint champion Donovan Bailey , 1992 champion Linford Christie of Britain and American 1984 and 1988 champion Carl Lewis . 
the American champion , who finished fourth in Atlanta , also beat world and Olympic champion Bailey in Zurich last week . 
you can bet my best is still to come , &quot; he said . 
Olympic champion Johnson defied the wet conditions at the start of the meeting to clock 12.92 seconds in the 110 hurdles , just one hundreth of a second outside the world record held by Britain &apos;s Colin Jackson . 
Johnson ran the same time at the U.S. Olympic trials in Atlanta in June to become the second equal fastest hurdler of all time with American Roger Kingdom . 
Jackson , the only man to have run faster , could not live with his speed , taking second in 13.24 seconds . 
komen failed to qualify for the Olympics but has run the second fastest 3,000 and 5,000 metres in history since the Games . 
on Friday the 20-year-old clocked 7 : 25.87 for the shorter race , beating Algerian world record holder Noureddine Morceli in the process . 
it was the third best time ever but komen was not satisfied . 
Olympic 1,500 metres champion Morceli , who has been suffering with injury since Atlanta , finished sixth in 7 : 36.81 , well outside his world record of 7 : 25.11 . 
&quot; The first kilometre was far too slow to beat the record , &quot; komen said . 
&quot; And Morceli wasn &apos;t really giving any help . 
seven athletes went into Friday &apos;s penultimate meeting of the Golden Four series with a chance of winning 20 one-kg gold bars . 
the prize , worth $ 250,000 , is shared between athletes who clinch specific events at each of the meetings in Oslo , Zurich , Brussels and Berlin . 
with next week &apos;s final meeting in the German capital remaining , only Jamaican Merlene Ottey , who finished third in the women &apos;s 100 metres , has dropped out of the race . 
the athletes still in the hunt are Namibia &apos;s Frankie Fredericks ( 200 metres ) , Denmark &apos;s Wilson Kipketer ( 800 ) , American Derrick Adkins ( 400 hurdles ) , Britain &apos;s Jonathan Edwards ( triple jump ) , German Lars Riedel ( discus ) and Bulgarian high jumper Stefka Kostadinova .
