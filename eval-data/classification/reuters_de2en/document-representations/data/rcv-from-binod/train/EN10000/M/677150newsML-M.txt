German Bunds and futures remained firm in late Friday trade , ticking back up after Thursday &apos;s sharp move south . 
traders said , however , that the market did not seem in the mood for a definitive move in either direction in the near term , with background EMU optimism still being disturbed by bouts of nerves from time to time . 
by 1403 GMT , the September DTB Bund future was trading 15 basis points higher at 101.16 , having dipped to a low of 100.85 in earlier trade in reaction to data showing stronger-than-forecast M3 money supply growth in May . 
in the cash market , the 10-year Bund was quoted up 22 at 101.82 for a 5.748 percent bid yield . 
for the week ahead , analysts said the market had little concrete to focus on other than EMU and G7 developments . 
&quot; What we &apos;re are seeing of late is that the market makes a strong move , like yesterday &apos;s sell-off , but then there is no follow through , &quot; said Charles Diebel , senior fixed income analyst at Technical Data in London . 
&quot; Most of the professional money is chasing the odd 50 basis point move , but cash investors are not really touching the markets . 
analysts said some evidence of general nervousness among retail investors was shown in the May M3 data released earlier . 
growth in M3 money supply ticked up to 7.0 percent in May from 6.7 percent in April , while capital formation -- or investment in securities -- slackened , reflecting investor relunctance to park money in long-term assets . 
may data for producer prices and import and export prices are due for release next week , but are unlikely to have any dramatic effect on the market , analysts said .
