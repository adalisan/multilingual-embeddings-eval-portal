SIMEX Nikkei futures pared early losses to end firmer on arbitrage buying on Thursday , but dealers said the market was likely to run into some resistance soon . 
&quot; There was a quite a good fight before it came back up , &quot; said a trader with a local futures house . 
he said there was strong buying interest in the December Nikkei between 20,500 and 21,000 points . 
after opening weak on the dollar &apos;s steep overnight drop and the Dow &apos;s decline , the benchark Nikkei 225 December contract finished at 21,320 against a previous 21,200 . 
the trader said the contract &apos;s close above 21,250 boded well for further gains , but it would have trouble climbing above 21,500 . 
&quot; The upside &apos;s looking a bit toppish . 
a trader with a U.S. house said the dollar &apos;s weakness against the yen was likely to be short-lived and the Nikkei would derive support from it once it climbed back above 110 yen .
