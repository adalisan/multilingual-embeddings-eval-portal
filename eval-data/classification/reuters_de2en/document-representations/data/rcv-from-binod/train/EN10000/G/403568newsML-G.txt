the Los Angeles dodgers agreed to terms Tuesday on a one-year contract with South Korean pitcher Chan Ho Park , who will be battling for a spot in the team &apos;s rotation . 
the 23-year-old Park went 5-5 last season with 119 strikeouts and a 3.64 earned run average over 48 appearances ( 10 starts ) , spanning 108 2 / 3 innings . 
the Korean right-hander also enjoyed a fine winter , compiling a 2-2 mark and 1.35 ERA in seven starts and one relief outing for Azucareros of the Dominican League . 
park , who made two appearances in both 1994 and 1995 with the dodgers , will vie for the fifth spot in the rotation with veteran knuckleballer Tom Candiotti .
