the Bank of England has further work to do before interest rates are high enough to save the economy from an unsustainable boom , analysts said . 
thus Thursday &apos;s third rise in official interest rates in three months is unlikely to be the last of the current round . 
&quot; The lack of measures to cool consumer demand in last week &apos;s budget didn &apos;t leave the Bank with much choice but to raise rates , &quot; said HSBC UK economist Dharshini David . 
&quot; We think they will have to put up rates next month as well , &quot; she said . 
the Bank of England &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee raised interest rates by 25 basis points , taking them to 6.75 percent , after rises of 25 basis points in both May and June . 
analysts expected the Bank to continue the policy of small , regular rate increases , in the hope of reconciling the need for higher rates to control consumer spending , with the need to prevent another surge in sterling , which could further jeopardise UK exports . 
there had been speculation that the Bank might have been tempted to raise rates by a 1 / 2 point at one fell swoop , in a bid to discourage the consumer sector as it indulged in a spending spree , financed by the 30 billion stg of windfall payments from building society flotations . 
&quot; They &apos;re still opting for a gradualist approach and trying to minimise the adverse effects on the pound and output , &quot; he said . 
&quot; A half point rise would have exacerbated the policy dilemma by increasing the attractions of the pound . 
it would not have solved it , &quot; he said . 
the central bank has expressed concern that the policy prescription for the export dominated manufacturing sector is the opposite of that required for the burgeoning service and consumer sector . 
but , analysts said it cannot afford to take the risk that consumer demand could spark a surge in inflation . 
the next meeting of the central bank &apos;s monetary committee takes place on August 6 and 7 , with the announcement of the decision on interest rates set for the 1100 GMT on the second day of the meeting . 
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown handed over control of monetary policy to the central bank shortly after the May 1 election and analysts said his July 2 budget showed he expected the central bank to use its new powers to prevent the economy from overheating . 
Brown increased taxes by 5.5 billion stg in the current fiscal year but aimed most of the tax increases at companies rather than the buoyant consumer sector . 
in a statement on today &apos;s interest rate rise , Brown said the central bank shared his view that Britain had to make sure it did not return to a cycle of boom and slump . 
the economy is currently enjoying its sixth year of recovery . 
he also sought to blame the Conservative administration , ousted in May after 18 years in power , for the need to increase interest rates now . 
&quot; inflationary pressures in the economy which , despite persistent warnings , the previous government negligently failed to tackle , must be brought under control , &quot; Brown said . 
the central bank &apos;s duty is to ensure the UK delivers the official target of 2.5 percent inflation . 
the difficulty of this task was highlighted by data for June which showed the underlying measure rising 2.7 percent , after managing to hit 2.5 percent in May . 
analysts are divided on where UK interest rates are going to end the year , with the lowest forecasts at around 7.0 percent and the most bearish at 8.0 percent . 
UBS economist Andy Cates expects only one more quarter point rise in interest rates this year and said that the economy does not need more stringent action . 
&quot; If the Bank &apos;s Committee does raise rates more aggressively than we have assumed we believe the economy will slow down markedly next year and by far more than is necessary to meet the inflation target , &quot; he said . 
but SBC-Warburg UK economist Darren Winder argues the ultimate peak in rates could be as high as 8.0 percent . 
&quot; While the economy is experiencing these windfalls , it is better to err on the side of too tight a monetary stance , rather than too lose -- that means higher interest rates and a strong pound , &quot; he said .
