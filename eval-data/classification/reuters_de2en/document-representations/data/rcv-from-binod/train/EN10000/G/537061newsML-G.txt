the world &apos;s democracies should be prepared to use force against rogue states which manage to obtain deadly biological and toxin weapons , a leading think-tank said on Thursday . 
the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) also said that defences should be boosted against the new generation of cruise missiles which could eventually eclipse ballistic weapons . 
the IISS Strategic Survey for 1996 / 7 said a 1972 convention on preventing the proliferation of biological weapons was not enough to prevent their acquisition and use . 
&quot; It is impossible to prevent rogue nations obtaining biological weapons and industrial democracies must therefore be prepared to use force to defend against such states , &quot; it said . 
Western experts fear that international outcasts such as Iraq and North Korea might be tempted to use biological weapons if international blockades against them became intolerable . 
rogue states could wreak havoc among their enemies and kill countless civilians by exposing them to biological agents such as anthrax or bubonic plague . 
the IISS said international fears were sparked by signs that Russia still had a massive biological weapons programme and by the discovery of an Iraqi biological arms arsenal after the 1991 Gulf War . 
the Jane &apos;s defence analysis group said earlier this month that Russia had developed a new variant of the anthrax toxin which was totally resistant to antibiotics . 
the IISS also said Western states should do more to restrict the spread of technology which could be used to produce a new generation of cruise missiles . 
&quot; The mere fact that ready sources of proliferation exist and that serious threats could emerge at the same time as first-generation cruise missiles suggests that considerable thought must be given to missile defence , &quot; it said . 
&quot; slowing the spread of these critical enabling technologies for highly effective cruise missiles will help defensive systems keep pace with threat improvements .
