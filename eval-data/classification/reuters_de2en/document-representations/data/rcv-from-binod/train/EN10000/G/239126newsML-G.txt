FIFA chairman Joao Havelange hit out on Friday over the headaches of staging the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea , saying the split was a political decision and politics never suited sport . 
in an interview with the Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport , soccer &apos;s top official also confirmed that FIFA could pull football out of the Olympics after a perceived snub to world soccer &apos;s governing body at this year &apos;s Atlanta Games . 
&quot; Everyone knows by now that organising ( the World Cup ) jointly between Korea and Japan was an international political decision , &quot; Havelange was quoted as saying . 
&quot; But what is good for politics is almost always bad for sport , &quot; he said in Barcelona , where FIFA &apos;s executive committee is due to meet at the weekend . 
its 33-point agenda will include the 2002 World Cup , at which Japan will host the final and South Korea the opening match . 
Havelange , a Brazilian , said the tournament was proving an organisational problem . 
&quot; How do you divide up the teams ? 
everybody is going to want to see Brazil , Italy , Argentina and Germany and maybe even Nigeria , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s not going to be easy to strike a balance in the draw for the groups . 
and where do you organise it ( the draw ) ? 
perhaps we should do it on a boat in the sea that separates the two countries . 
FIFA &apos;s executive committee will also consider a proposal to abolish the Olympic soccer tournament , which predates the World Cup by 30 years , and instead introduce an under-23 world championship . 
throwing his weight behind the idea , Havelange said soccer had gained nothing in financial terms from the Atlanta Games . 
&quot; If it continues to be marginalised , yes , &quot; Havelange said when asked if soccer could go from the Olympic programme . 
&quot; The tournament in the United States was played everywhere except in Atlanta , not even one match there . 
soccer pulled in 1.4 million spectators , more than the other sports put together and it got nothing in return . 
Havelange said the proposed under-23 tournament would be played among 24 or 32 teams in the year before the Olympics &quot; and not necessarily in the same country &quot; . 
&quot; The best 16 would qualify for the Games . 
in that way , under FIFA &apos;s management , you could earn money to share out among all the participants . 
and the Olympics would also have its soccer tournament but with the dignity of other team sports , &quot; he said .
