economic reforms have enabled Yemen to drive annual inflation down to 10 percent last year from 120 percent in 1994 , the impoverished Arab state &apos;s prime minister said on Wednesday . 
&quot; The inflation rate has fallen from 120 percent in 1994 to 10 percent by the end of 1996 due to the economic reform programme , &quot; Abdul-Aziz Abdul-Ghani told a news conference . 
Yemen launched an economic reform programme in March 1995 in agreement with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank . 
Abdel-Ghani said unemployment was still high but added accurate statistics on the jobless rate were not available . 
economists in Sanaa estimate unemployment ranges between 35 to 50 percent .
