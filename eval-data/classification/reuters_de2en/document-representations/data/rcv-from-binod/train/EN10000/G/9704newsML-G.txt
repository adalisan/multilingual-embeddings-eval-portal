Australia signalled on Thursday that it would take the lead in rescuing a nuclear test ban treaty by sponsoring a U.N. resolution which would bypass India &apos;s veto on the pact . 
after Iran used procedural wrangling to prevent the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva from making its final report on the failed negotiations , Australian ambassador Richard Starr said the treaty could not be allowed to die after years of work . 
&quot; We cannot give up . 
the opportunity is here now , it will not last , &quot; Starr said . 
&quot; We must grasp it or lose it and with it the whole critical step towards nuclear disarmament . 
Western diplomats expect Australia to sponsor a resolution at the U.N. General Assembly calling for the treaty to be opened for signature despite the Indian and Iranian opposition . 
&quot; The Australians are getting ready . 
they have prepared a text and are showing it around to get opinions , &quot; said one diplomat , adding that he expected an announcement on Friday . 
India vetoed adoption of the draft Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) , which would ban all nuclear explosions , in the Geneva body two days ago . 
it says it opposes the draft because it does not commit the five declared nuclear powers -- Britain , China , France , Russia and the United States -- to a timetable for dismantling their arsenals . 
however , treaty backers still hope to send the text to the General Assembly for signature next month , according to a timetable set by the 185-member world body last December . 
&quot; We have a workable treaty and we have a commitment by the five nuclear weapon states to endorse and sign it , &quot; Starr said in a speech at the close of the morning session in Geneva . 
&quot; It is in the interests of this conference that , given this paralysis , its work be taken to the broader international community , recognised and endorsed . 
&quot; accordingly , Australia will be looking to work with friends of the CTBT to fulfil the goal of the 50th General Assembly of a completed text , endorsed and ready for signature by the 51st assembly this year . 
Starr told reporters the decision rested with his government in Canberra and he hoped it would come &quot; shortly &quot; . 
&quot; My government has said quite clearly that we do not want this text to die in the ad hoc committee , &quot; he said . 
U.S. ambassador Stephen Ledogar , asked whether Australia was expected to bring the text to the General Assembly , replied : &quot; It looks like they will be playing an important role . 
the conference had been expected to wrap up its work on the CTBT by adopting the committee &apos;s report summarising more than two years of negotiations and stating no consensus was reached . 
but Iran &apos;s envoy Sirous Nasseri set off more than two hours of heated procedural debate on whether to accept a proposal by Pakistan to send the committee &apos;s final report to New York . 
&quot; Pakistan was just trying to goad India , &quot; one envoy said . 
&quot; Neither India nor Iran want to help the process in New York . 
Poland &apos;s envoy Ludwik Dembinski , who currently chairs the 61-member conference , held consultations before a resumed meeting at five p.m. ( 1500 GMT ) . 
but Nasseri said he doubted whether he would be able to get instructions from Tehran by the end of day because it was a holiday there . 
influential non-aligned states including Pakistan , Mexico , Brazil , Egypt , Peru and Chile backed the treaty on Thursday . 
Pakistan &apos;s envoy Munir Akram read out his country &apos;s simple proposal : &quot; The Conference on Disarmament decides to transmit immediately the report of its ad hoc Commitee on the nuclear test ban treaty to the U.N. General Assembly . 
but Iran &apos;s Nasseri repeatedly objected that Pakistan &apos;s proposal was not appropriately formatted and did not respect rules of procedure allowing delegations two weeks to decide . 
Ledogar said in a brief speech : &quot; I wish to make clear that the United States supports this treaty text as it is . 
&quot; We call on those delegations which have not yet done so to join with us in support of this text . 
nearly identical statements were read out by Russia &apos;s Grigory Berdennikov , China &apos;s Sha Zukang , France &apos;s Joelle Bourgois and Britain &apos;s Sir Michael Weston . 
later Sha left the morning debate , telling reporters : &quot; It is a waste of time .
