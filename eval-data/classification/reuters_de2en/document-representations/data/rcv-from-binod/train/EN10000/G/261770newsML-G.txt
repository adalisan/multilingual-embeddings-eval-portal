despite efforts to soften a bitter public row over U.S. command of NATO forces in southern Europe , France and the United States gave no sign on Tuesday that they were near settlement of the dispute . 
French Defence Minister Charles Millon told NATO defence ministers that France was not ready to drop its demand that the military post in Naples be turned over by Washington to a European officer as &quot; one of the clear signals of alliance renovation &quot; after the Cold War . 
&quot; The French position is known . 
it follows a clear political logic , &quot; Millon told his fellow ministers , according to a text of his prepared remarks obtained by Reuters . 
U.S. officials said privately that Defence Secretary William Perry and Millon would meet on bilateral issues on Wednesday morning and they did not expect a settlement of the dispute although it was likely to be discussed . 
the U.S. military already fills the job of commander of all NATO forces in Europe . 
but despite pressure from France and some other allies to turn over the southern NATO command to a European officer , Washington says it , too , should remain in U.S. hands because the bulk of forces in the region , including the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean , are American . 
&quot; Officials of both countries badly want to settle this thing . 
but right now they appear to be entrenched , &quot; one NATO official told Reuters privately . 
&quot; There doesn &apos;t seem to be a lot of compromise at the moment . 
&quot; This question , you know , is one of the keys to our ( French ) future relations with NATO , &quot; Millon told the ministers . 
&quot; We cannot give up , because it is one of the signals of alliance renovation &quot; after the Cold War , he added of France &apos;s announcement last year that it intended to rejoin NATO &apos;S military structure after an absence of three decades . 
he said France recognised U.S. concerns about the command in the region , but &quot; there is no obstacle that cannot be overcome ... &quot; . 
although the United States position remains firm on the issue , both countries have in recent days indicated they want to settle it without further public acrimony . 
U.S. ambassador to NATO Robert Hunter made a conciliatory statement at a press conference here on Tuesday , a day after French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette visited the U.S. State Department in Washington with praise for outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher . 
&quot; We have said -- and on this we have the broad backing of most of the allies -- that it is essential for us ... that in the restructuring of commands we retain the command &quot; in Naples , Hunter told reporters . 
but , he hastily added , the United States wants to address &quot; the desire expressed by a number of European countries , including France , for a greater role for Europeans , greater responsibility , more command slots going to Europeans , greater visibility &quot; in NATO . 
&quot; And we are pleased to discuss a wide range of alternatives with regard to that and on that basis , I suspect we will find a way to move this to conclusion . 
hunter did not give details , but de Charette &apos;s visit to the State Department on a Washington trip also appeared designed to patch up the long and often fractious alliance between Washington and Paris . 
German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe told reporters here on Tuesday that Germany supported France &apos;s call for the command change . 
in the new NATO , he said , the balance between Europe and America has changed , &quot; and the command structure needs to reflect that . 
Perry told reporters in Brussels on Monday that the Naples command issue had not &quot; soured &quot; the overall relationship between the United States and France , which has been strained over other issues including the U.N. secretary-general &apos;s job and Africa . 
the United States accused de Charette last week of intentionally snubbing Christopher last week during a tribute to outgoing Secretary of State Christopher by fellow foreign ministers in Brussels . 
French officials said later the foreign minister had left the meeting unaware that a toast was to be made to Christopher and denied that the move was an intentional snub .
