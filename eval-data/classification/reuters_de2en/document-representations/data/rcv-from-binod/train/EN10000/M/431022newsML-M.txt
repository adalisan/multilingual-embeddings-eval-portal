wall Street stocks are expected to open higher Monday , following through on Friday &apos;s rally . 
with no important economic data due today , investors will take heart from several factors , including the fact that fears about interest rates were soothed last week . 
&quot; European markets are higher , the dollar is weaker and the bond market is up somewhat , &quot; said Peter Cardillo , director of research at Westfalia Investments . 
&quot; In the absence of economic news until later in the week , we will have two days during which the market will focus on externals like what is happening in Europe and what is happening in the bond market , &quot; Cardillo said . 
the dollar was lower gainst both the yen and mark in listless Tokyo trading and held the mid-range against the mark in Europe . 
U.S. treasuries were mostly slightly higher , with the long bond up 4 / 32 to yield 6.81 percent . 
in Tokyo the Nikkei average lost 84.85 points , or 0.47 percent , to 18,113.89 . 
among U.S. stocks traded in London , Eli Lilly and Co came under pressure after the Wall Street Journal &apos;s &quot; heard on the Street &quot; column said a controversy over its new drug for psychotics &quot; reminded everybody how vulnerable Lilly &apos;s still richly valued stock may be . 
Corning Inc was firmer after saying Friday that it expected first quarter earnings to be up around 40 percent from a year earlier . 
Corning shares were 3 / 8 firmer at 39-1 / 2 . 
general Motors Corp climbed 1 / 4 to 57 , boosted by news that it was close to signing a $ 1.0 billion joint venture in China , dealers said . 
Heinz Co is expected to cut its staff and take a pre-tax charge of more than $ 500 million in its fiscal fourth quarter ending April 30 . 
Heinz shares are little traded in London but dealers said the early indications were that the shares would come under pressure . 
Cardillo said , &quot; A rally will probably take us to the upper end of the Dow &apos;s trading range over the next couple of days . 
the market is in the hands of large cap stocks while the smaller cap ones are not doing much of anything . 
he said this state of affairs is a greater danger to the market than an interest rate hike . 
&quot; If and when we get a major disappointment in large cap earnings , the whole group will be hard hit and that will be reflected in the averages , &quot; he said . 
&quot; If the market doesn &apos;t broaden out , we will get a correction that will be none too light as far as large caps are concerned . 
the New York Times &apos;s &quot; Market Place &quot; column said some observers believe Lucent Technologies Inc could make an acquisition to become a stronger force in data networking .
