an Algerian man suspected of organising a bloody 1995 bomb attack on a Paris commuter train will soon be formally placed under investigation , justice sources said on Wednesday . 
the sources said the move would target Boualem Bensaid , believed by French investigators to have been ringleader of the group which carried out the bombing of the RER underground train at the Saint Michel station in central Paris . 
eight people were killed and nearly 100 were injured in the attack , the first of a series in 1995 and 1996 blamed by investigators on Algerian fundamentalist rebels angry at France &apos;s backing for the government of its former colony . 
the development coincided with a decision by anti-terrorist judges Jean-Francois Ricard and Jean-Louis Bruguiere , who have been leading the probe into the Saint Michel attack , to brief relatives of the victims on Friday on the progress of their investigation , the sources said . 
being placed under investigation in France is similar to an arraignment . 
it is a preliminary step to a trial but does not imply guilt and does not necessarily lead to a trial . 
the ruthless Armed Islamic Group ( GIA ) has claimed responsibility for the 1995 bombing attacks , accusing France of siding with Algeria &apos;s military government in a civil war against Moslem fundamentalists . 
no one has claimed responsibility for the 1996 attacks . 
the GIA said its attacks were intended to avenge the deaths of four of its members in December 1994 when French commandos stormed an Air France airliner they had hijacked and freed their 169 hostages . 
Bensaid was arrested in the northern city of Lille in November 1995 along with nine other suspects . 
investigators have said they believe he worked on the Saint Michel attack with Ali touchent , an Algerian architecture student also known as &quot; Tarek &quot; whose current whereabouts are unknown , and Khaled Kelkal , a young Frenchman of Algerian origin who was shot dead by police near Lyon , central France , in September 1995 . 
Bensaid &apos;s fingerprints have been found on two bombs linked to Algerian rebel groups operating in France , according to investigators . 
one , which failed to go off , was found next to a high-speed TGV passenger train line linking Paris and Lyon in August 1995 , investigators said . 
the second blew up near an entrance to the Maison Blanche Metro underground station in Paris in October 1995 , injuring 13 . 
several Algerian rebel groups including the GIA have vowed to topple the Algerian government and transform the north African state into an Islamic republic . 
an estimated 60,000 people have died in civil strife in Algeria since authorities there cancelled a general election in 1992 that the fundamentalists were poised to win .
