Singapore &apos;s trade growth is unlikely to be affected by recent falls in Southeast Asian currencies because long-term fundamentals were what mattered , a Trade Development Board official said on Monday . 
the government was focused on long-term fundamentals which would affect growth , said Chan Kam Fai , the TDB &apos;s director of the trade policy division . 
the fundamentals look good , Chan told a news conference called to announce trade figures . 
&quot; What is important is not the nominal exchange rate but the real exchange rate because any change in the nominal exchange rate is eventually short term in nature in terms of export competitiveness , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The larger issue here is not to look at the U.S. dollar and the Singapore dollar but on the long term competitiveness of Singapore exports &quot; , Chan said . 
non-oil domestic exports rose by 4.4 percent in the second quarter of 1997 after contracting 4.1 percent in the first quarter , giving a growth of 0.2 percent for the first half .
