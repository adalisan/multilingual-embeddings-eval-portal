Latvian blue chip prices gained slightly on Tuesday in higher volume as low prices prompted cautiously rising investor interest , dealers said . 
total turnover came to 125,000 lats from 77,000 lats and the Rietumu index added 0.46 percent to 176.01 points . 
Saules Bank index Saule10 was also up , climbing 0.32 percent to 136.78 . 
&quot; Some official list prices , including the Riga Transport Fleet and the Riga Shipyard , seem to have stabilised and low levels of prices in general are starting to attract investors , &quot; Girts Ozols of Hansbank Latvia told Reuters . 
Riga Shipyard was the most active stock in trade of 34,400 lats and held steady at 1.32 lats . 
most official list stocks registered gains today , including the Riga Transport Fleet and Kaija fish cannery . 
Riga Transport fleet rose to 1.26 lats from 1.24 lats and traded 16,400 lats while Kaija added one santime to 2.10 lats on volume of 13,200 lats . 
the secondary market was led by Valmiera Glassfibre which registered trade of 16,100 lats and rose to 1.42 lats from 1.40 lats . 
&quot; It is hard to say whether Valmiera is back on an upward track , &quot; Ozols said . 
&quot; But we saw some investors today who considered the price low enough for buying . 
Daugavpils Chain was seen by most dealers as having stabilised before its May 30 bonus share deadline . 
Daugavpils traded 6,000 lats and remained stable at 2.30 lats .
