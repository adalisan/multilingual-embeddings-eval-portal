Vietnam &apos;s official media headlined the appointment of eight new cabinet ministers on Thursday , marking a major personnel reshuffle for the communist country , but analysts reserved judgement on the likely impact . 
the choice of new ministers was approved by the National Assembly late on Wednesday following reports of unprecedented debate among delegates and the rejection of the prime minister &apos;s choice of transport minister . 
many of the new , younger faces were relatively unknown . 
all are men , five speak English , most have some economic expertise and all but one is a member of the Communist Party &apos;s prestigious Central Committee . 
but most are mandarins shunted along the traditional career path from vice-ministerial positions . 
&quot; It is clear as mud , &quot; said one Western analyst . 
&quot; We only know one or two of the people who are taking these positions , and realistically it &apos;s going to take time before people can tell what impact they &apos;ll have . 
prominent among the new line-up is the new interior minister , Lieutenant-General Le Minh Huong , a member of the elite Politburo and former head of police intelligence . 
well-known in Hanoi &apos;s overseas business community is Tran Xuan Gia , who becomes minister of planning and investment . 
he is a former lecturer at the National Economics University and is seen as having had a role in attracting foreign investors to Vietnam . 
but while others on the new-look cabinet may have risen from less prominent positions , business analysts were generally optimistic about the changes . 
&quot; We know some of these people quite well , &quot; said an American businessman . 
&quot; We think the new finance minister is a great choice and speaks truly well for Vietnam . 
this choice is based on ability and merit . 
the new finance minister is Nguyen Sinh hung , an economy expert who replaces Ho Te . 
Hanoi has presented the changes as an injection of younger blood into a government system dominated by men in their late sixties or seventies . 
the average age of the newcomers is 54 . 
as such , the reshuffle is in line with moves begun earlier this year at the party congress to revitalise a system in which many top officials began their careers during Vietnam &apos;s communist revolution in the 1930s . 
but how much influence the new ministers will have was not yet clear . 
Western economists and diplomats say contradictory political signals that have appeared since the late-June congress have left Hanoi looking uncertain about its future policy direction . 
with key decisions made at the politburo rather than cabinet level , analysts say the new ministers could be constrained by blockages or indecision elsewhere in the political system . 
the National Assembly agreed to vacate 12 cabinet posts to make way for the newcomers . 
there was no word on the remaining four unfilled positions on Thursday . 
the official Vietnam News simply said that four ministers had been relieved of their duties . 
State television said two had been retired , while informed sources said replacements for all four positions were likely to be announced soon . 
barring a break with normal practice , the new ministers would be formally appointed at the close of the National Assembly &apos;s autumn session next week .
