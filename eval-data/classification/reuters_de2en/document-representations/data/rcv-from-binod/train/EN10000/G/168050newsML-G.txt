the U.S. military rejected on Tuesday a request by South Korean prosecutors to hand over an American serviceman alleged to have admitted to murdering a local woman in September . 
but the United States Forces Korea ( USFK ) said in a statement it would make the accused , Eric Munnich , available to a South Korean court for trial . 
&quot; General John H Tilelli Jr , commander ( of ) USFK , is unable to direct the transfer of custody of Private Munnich at this time , &quot; said the statement . 
the U.S. military earlier said Munnich , from Chicago , had admitted to the murder during joint questioning by South Korean police and U.S. military investigators . 
in early September Lee Ki-sun , 44 , was found stabbed to death in a boarding house near a U.S. military base north of Seoul where Munnich is stationed . 
&quot; Nevertheless , USFK will make Private Munnich available for trial in Korean court ... , &quot; the statement said . 
the military was required through agreements with South Korea to consider custody requests , it said . 
Munnich is now being detained at a U.S. military facility where &quot; he remains confined so that he cannot flee , destroy any evidence , or commit any offence &quot; , the statement said . 
the United States maintains 37,000 troops in South Korea , which technically remains at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a ceasefire .
