a reform commission seeking ways of ending Italy &apos;s infamous history of brief , weak governments voted on Wednesday in favour of introducing a presidential-style system instead of beefing up the role of the prime minister . 
the recommendation , approved by the all-party commission by 36 votes to 31 with three abstentions , was greeted with delight by the centre-right opposition and with gloom by the hard-left . 
opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi , whose centre-right Freedom Alliance had championed a shift to a presidential system , hailed the vote in the bi-cameral commission , whose recommendations will be put to a referendum . 
&quot; I think we can be satisfied by today &apos;s vote since we were the first to underline the need for a reform to ensure that the head of state should be above party politics but elected directly by the people , &quot; Berlusconi said . 
however , both he and commission chairman Massimo D &apos;Alema said that a French-style presidential system -- which has now yoked conservative President Jacques Chirac to socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin -- would not be appropriate in Italy . 
d &apos;Alema &apos;s ex-communist Democratic Party of the Left is the biggest in Prime Minister Romano Prodi &apos;s centre-left government . 
Italy &apos;s post-war constitution , designed to make sure no-one could ever again be as powerful as Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini , provides for a largely symbolic head of state , while the government is entirely responsible for policy initiatives . 
the president appoints the prime minister after cumbersome consultations with all forces in Italy &apos;s fractured political world . 
the premier has no direct mandate from voters and can be ousted with relative ease by parliament . 
modern Italian governments have consequently lasted just 11 months on average and Italy is now on its 55th since the war . 
the rise of the separatist protest vote in Italy &apos;s wealthy north has underscored the need for reform in a country which has had three general elections in the upheavals since 1992 when the exposure of entrenched corruption felled the ruling old guard . 
an alternative proposal before the commission , backed by the left and government ally Communist Refoundation , was to strengthen the role of the prime minister instead , giving him or her the power to name ministers and dissolve parliament alone . 
the presidential proposal was approved with the votes of the separatist Northern League , which has boycotted proceedings practically since the commission began work at the end of January and only returned to the forum on Tuesday . 
the hard-left Communist Refoundation , king-maker in the current parliament , slammed the outcome as a dark day for democracy . 
&quot; It &apos;s a disastrous end to a badly-run affair , &quot; leader Fausto Bertinotti told reporters . 
he said the semi-presidential system would &quot; move us further away from democracy &quot; and vowed to step up his party &apos;s opposition to presidential-style government . 
d &apos;Alema refused to comment on whether he considered the decision a defeat , saying only : &quot; It &apos;s a step forward . 
electoral reform was the trickiest part of the commission &apos;s work , and was left until last after the commission on Tuesday agreed proposals for federalism , justice reforms and a new-look parliament whose two houses no longer duplicate each other . 
having now adopted basic texts as a preliminary recommendation for reform , the commission will next week begin examining amendments . 
it must report to parliament by the end of June . 
both houses are then expected to spend a year studying proposals and drawing up a package of changes to put to a referendum .
