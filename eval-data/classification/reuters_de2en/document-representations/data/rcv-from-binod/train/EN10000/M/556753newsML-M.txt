gold prices straddled $ 340.00 per ounce on Friday afternoon , roughly the mean of the week &apos;s narrow range having been unmoved by the latest U.S. economic data . 
April employment data released at 1230 GMT showed an increase in the nonfarm payroll of 142,000 against a forecast 211,000 persons and the March figure was revived to 314,000 from 175,000 . 
the data provoked positive comments from U.S. President Bill Clinton -- inflation was low and the economy was in the best shape for 30 years -- reducing the likelihood of an interest rate rise later this month . 
gold fixed at $ 339.65 after $ 339.80 this morning in a market which was still slow and thin after the May Day holiday in Europe . 
the June COMEX contract was down $ 0.40 at $ 341.30 . 
continuing the holiday mood , London is closed on Monday and Tokyo will also be shut for Japan &apos;s Golden Week celebrations . 
dealing in London was distracted also by the overnight win of the UK &apos;s Labour Party which swept out the Conservative government with a landslide result . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think it will go far today , &quot; said one dealer of a gold market where attention was desultory . 
however relatively benign U.S. data this week was probably a factor behind gold clinging to the $ 340.00 level after it had been forecast to test four-year lows around $ 336.00 a week ago . 
&quot; The G7 , the IMF and the U.S. data have all been fairly neutral for gold . 
it could have been a lot worse , &quot; one analyst said , adding that there was still room for a fall . 
however the upside was limited too with the fear that the producers would take advantage of any price rise with accelerated selling . 
silver was a little lower at $ 4.72 / $ 4.74 down three cents . 
dealers said silver had held on well this week when it was fancied to go lower and short covering could be expected on any rise . 
even so $ 4.80- $ 4.85 was about as high as it would get . 
&quot; If it breaks through $ 4.60 , then there would be another 40 cents to go , &quot; one dealer said . 
platinum and palladium moved narrowly in opposite directions with platinum $ 1.30 easier at $ 371.20 / $ 372.20 and palladium 50 cents firmer at $ 157.00 / $ 158.00
