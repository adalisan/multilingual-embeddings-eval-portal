Indonesia &apos;s armed forces commander General Feisal Tanjung said authorities would deal harshly with any attempts to disrupt general elections on May 29 , the official Antara news agency reported on Sunday . 
&quot; This applies to every effort to disturb or foil the general elections in 1997 , &quot; Tanjung was quoted as saying on Saturday . 
Antara gave no other details . 
Tanjung made his comments the same day President Suharto urged Indonesians to vote in the elections , thereby helping determine the course of national development . 
Tanjung said there were &quot; certain groups &quot; in society that would like to disrupt the polls . 
he did not elaborate . 
many younger Indonesians are known to have refused to vote in past elections in protest against the policies of Suharto &apos;s government . 
Suharto , 75 , has not revealed whether he will step down after his sixth five-year term ends in March 1998 . 
but the ruling Golkar party , of which he is leader , has begun pushing for him to stay in office another five years . 
Interior Minister Yogie Suardi Memet said this week the country &apos;s six million civil servants were required to vote for Golkar .
