the Japanese economy is on a gradual recovery trend despite the effects of the April 1 sales tax increase , the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) said in its latest monthly report . 
the BOJ also said that Japan &apos;s trade surplus has been on a rising trend since the latter half of 1996 . 
&quot; The economy basically is on a gradual recovery trend and private demand is becoming firmer , although it is accompanied by fluctuations arising from an increase in the national consumption tax , &quot; the report said . 
it added that , although the tax rise brought about a drop in private consumption in April , the recovery trend for private consumption remained intact . 
Japan &apos;s trade surplus has been on a rising trend since the latter half of last year due to strong growth in exports brought about by the weakening of the yen , the report said . 
it also said , however , that the yen &apos;s weakness was recently being corrected rather rapidly . 
the report added that the narrowing of the gap between higher U.S. interest rates and lower rates in Japan was one factor behind this correction . 
it said that the rise in Japanese long-term interest rates and in Japanese stock prices reflected receding uncertainty in the financial markets over Japan &apos;s economic outlook .
