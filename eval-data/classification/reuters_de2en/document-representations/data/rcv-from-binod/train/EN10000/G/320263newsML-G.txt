a masked gunman killed a Palestine Liberation Organisation guerrilla in a south Lebanon refugee camp over the weekend , security sources said on Monday . 
they said the gunman fired at Jamal Ayyoub , a 27-year-old member of the PLO &apos;s Fatah faction , before midnight on Saturday in Ain el-Hilweh camp near the southern port of Sidon , killing him instantly . 
it was not immediately known who was behind Ayyoub &apos;s killing , the sources added . 
it was the third incident in which a masked gunman killed a Palestinian guerrilla since the start of the year . 
last Tuesday , a gunman firing a sub-machinegun killed a former member of the radical Fatah Revolutionary Council ( FRC ) in Ain el-Hilweh , 40 km ( 25 miles ) south of Beirut . 
inter-Palestinian feuds have claimed the lives of several officials and members of the rival groups in Lebanon in recent years .
