South African cricket bosses are putting together a plan to extend the career of fast Bowler Allan Donald . 
Donald , and his English wife Tina have been invited to a meeting with convenor of selectors Peter pollock and United Cricket Board of South Africa ( UCBSA ) managing director Ali Bacher before the third test against India in Johannesburg which starts next Thursday , Bacher said on Friday . 
&quot; We are going to have a chat with him and try and work out a way to keep him playing for another five years , &quot; he told Reuters . 
&quot; He is bowling at his peak now but whereas other fast bowlers are finishing at 31 or 32 we believe Allan can bowl as he is now for five more years . 
Donald , 30 , has once again demonstrated his fundamental importance to South Africa &apos;s international strategy during the current series with India . 
he is the leading wicket taker after two tests with 14 scalps to his name and has invariably provided the breakthrough when called upon by skipper Hansie Cronje . 
in his 29 tests since South Africa &apos;s readmission he has taken 138 wickets to become the second-biggest wicket taker in his country &apos;s test history . 
only Hugh Tayfield with 170 wickets in 37 tests in the 1950s is ahead of him on the list . 
Donald returns to English championship county Warwickshire in 1997 , tours England with South Africa in 1998 and is central to his country &apos;s plans for the 1999 World Cup also in England . 
&quot; We have got various ideas to put to Allan and his wife , &quot; Bacher said . 
&quot; Such as cutting down on his provincial cricket -- for instance he is not playing for his province Free State against India -- securing his financial future , giving him more holidays , things like that . 
Donald said on Friday he was looking no further than beyond the 1999 World Cup but added : &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what the meeting will be about but if Doctor Bacher has my health and well-being in mind then that &apos;s obviously good news for me . 
after the final test against India , South Africa have a home three-test series against Australia .
