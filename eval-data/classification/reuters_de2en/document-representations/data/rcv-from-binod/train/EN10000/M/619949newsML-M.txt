&quot; Furthermore , the situation with the teachers provides cause for concern , &quot; another dealer said . 
thousands of teachers have clogged up Mexico City traffic in recent days in marches to protest what they consider an inadequate pay award . 
Roberto Galvan , an analyst at the Bursametrica consultancy , said rises in primary interest rates and weak trade surplus figures also hit the market .

traders said telecomms stock Telmex and financial firm Bancomer led the slide , dealers said . 
the two stocks together accounted for 30 percent of all shares traded .
