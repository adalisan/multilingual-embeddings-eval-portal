attractive yields and strong investor interest have catapulted the Cairo stock exchange to the highest level in its history and brokers say the gains are here to stay . 
this month &apos;s Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference and low price-to-earnings ( PE ) ratios have also launched Egypt &apos;s capital market on the fast track to fame and fortune and sent share prices soaring . 
&quot; The take-off has started , &quot; Shireen ElKady , chief financial officer and vice-president of market analysts arbitrage / Prime Investment , told Reuters . 
&quot; People expected the MENA conference to affect other sectors of the economy but its first influence can be seen on the capital market . 
foreign investors are buying quantities . 
the Egyptian Capital Market Authority ( CMA ) all-share index , rising all last week on gains in blue-chip cement and milling firms , closed on Sunday 6.6 points up at 260.54 -- breaking the record of 255.05 set on October 19 , 1994 . 
brokers say the conference in Egypt revealed the financial delights of the Cairo bourse to hundreds of delegates and now they have come back to do business . 
the market &apos;s relatively low PE of about 8.5 and a change in local investors &apos; mentality towards long-term investment have also buoyed share prices , brokers say . 
they say the market will soon see PES of about 13 and 14 as foreigners continue to buy in bulk and local investors , eyeing future rises , hang on to their portfolios . 
the banking , cement and milling sectors are currently the most attractive , the brokers added . 
&quot; It &apos;s going to boom for a long while yet , &quot; said Amr Abu el-Magd , managing director of brokers Megavest . 
&quot; People now have more knowledge and they aren &apos;t selling . 
there are also a lot of funds wanting to get into the market so prices are definitely going to increase , &quot; he added . 
two international funds trade Egyptian equities -- HSBC James Capel &apos;s Concord Fund and the Egypt Trust of SBC Warburg and Lazard Freres &apos; Capital Markets . 
brokers also say many other securities houses are stocking up on Cairo shares . 
but sceptics are questioning the sustainability of the bourse &apos;s rapid rise . 
they point out that the market usually rises ahead of dividend distribution time and after results are published . 
brokers said the market had enough steam to rise for at least another three weeks . 
then it would stabilise , not fall . 
&quot; No prices are going down . 
they will stabilise in about three weeks and then move in a range of two to three percent , not the current five percent or more , &quot; Abu el-Magd said . 
analyst ElKady said that as long as Egypt kept privatising , the bourse would maintain its uptrend and even scale new highs . 
&quot; The state can sustain the rise by giving more merchandise ( that is ) shares . 
it has to begin with reducing its holding in firms already listed on the bourse , &quot; he added . 
ElKady said the state &apos;s offer to auction 10 percent of Helwan Portland cement was a step in the right direction . 
the sale of 20 percent in Cairo Pharmaceutical and Chemical Industries was also encouraging . 
the state has also promised to sell 91 firms by the middle of 1998 and officials have repeatedly said privatisation and liberalisation were the two main steps towards economic growth . 
&quot; The Cairo market is on its way to become an excellent market . 
the market is definitely taking on a new dimension , &quot; said Walid el-Kholy of El Rashad brokerage and Securities .
