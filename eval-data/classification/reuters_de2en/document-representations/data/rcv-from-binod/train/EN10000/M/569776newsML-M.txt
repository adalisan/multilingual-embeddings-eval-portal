U.S. Plains feedlot cattle sales were light near midday Thursday at $ 69.00 per cwt , steady with active trade on Tuesday , feedlot sources said . 
about 4,000 steers and heifers that will likely grade select and choice were sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area , they said . 
the sales bring Panhandle week-to-date sales near 85,000 . 
there were no reported sales in Kansas , but light trade was also expected at $ 69.00 , the sources said . 
week to date sales in Kansas by early Thursday were pegged near 88,000 head , they said . 
most of this week &apos;s showlists were close to being sold out , market sources said . 
&quot; There &apos;s no wall of cattle out there . 
people have done a good job of staying current , &quot; one Kansas feedlot manager said . 
fed cattle prices were lifted this week by strong demand from packers looking to fill beef orders from retailers stocking up for Memorial Day promotions , market sources said . 
however , lower beef prices on Wednesday suggested that holiday beef demand may have peaked , they said . 
beef prices at midday were quoted down $ 0.18 to $ 0.62 per cwt , with 210 fabricated beef loads sold , USDA reported .
