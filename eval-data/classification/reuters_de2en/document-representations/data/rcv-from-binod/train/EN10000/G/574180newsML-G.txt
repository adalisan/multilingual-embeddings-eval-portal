China has protested strongly against the hoisting of a Philippine flag on a shoal in the South China Sea and asked its immediate removal , Filipino diplomats said on Saturday . 
the Chinese embassy , in a diplomatic note sent to the Department of Foreign Affairs on Friday , also complained about the deployment of Philippine Navy patrol boats near Scarborough shoal , said the officials , who asked not to be named . 
the Philippine Navy said local fishermen raised the Philippine flag on April 30 after seeing two Chinese vessels near the shoal to assert Philippine sovereignty and discourage intrusion by foreign vessels into Philippine waters . 
the fishermen also removed Chinese markers installed near the shoal , the Navy said . 
the shoal lies west of Zambales province just north of Manila and is not part of the Spratly Islands , a cluster of potentially oil-rich isles and reefs being claimed by six Asian countries . 
Beijing says all the islands in the South China Sea historically belongs to China . 
the Spratlys are also claimed wholly or in part by Vietnam , Taiwan , the Philippines , Malaysia and Brunei . 
the Chinese embassy note said the ships sighted near Scarborough shoal were carrying members of a Chinese youth non-governmental organisation and that the presence of Filipinos on the shoal disturbed the Chinese group . 
&quot; They asked the flag to be removed immediately , &quot; a Filipino diplomat said . 
defence Secretary Renato de Villa has said Scarborough shoal is within the Philippines &apos; 200-mile exclusive economic zone . 
the Chinese protest followed a diplomatic clash between Manila and Beijing over alleged intrusion by Chinese naval ships last month near two islands claimed by Manila in the Spratlys . 
Manila said the Chinese naval ships stayed for several days in the area near a hut-like structure built over a reef . 
China pulled out the vessels , which it said were on a scientific research mission , after the Philippines protested , and a senior Philippine army officer said on Friday the hut had also disappeared .
