Taiwan persisted on Saturday in defying rival China &apos;s calls for an end to the diplomatically isolated island &apos;s drive for a higher international profile , sending its foreign minister to Malaysia . 
&quot; visiting overseas is very normal , &quot; Foreign Minister John Chang told Taiwan &apos;s Chinese Television during a transit stop in Singapore . 
&quot; To exchange ideas and have contacts with foreign countries -- this is very important . 
Chang blamed Beijing &apos;s communist government for the secrecy cloaking his Malaysia journey , which -- like an equally furtive trip to Indonesia on Wednesday -- was sure to anger China . 
&quot; As we don &apos;t have diplomatic ties ( with Malaysia ) , I had to keep my departure secret , &quot; said Chang , who reportedly was travelling under an alias . 
&quot; Due to pressure from the mainland China side , I could not reveal my plans to the media beforehand , &quot; he said . 
Taiwan &apos;s Foreign Ministry declined to comment and it was not known who Chang planned to meet in Malaysia . 
in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia officials were tight-lipped about Chang &apos;s presence . 
&quot; At this particular juncture , we are not able to shed any light &quot; on Chang &apos;s visit , a Malaysian Foreign Ministry official told Reuters . 
China said on Friday that it had admonished Indonesia for letting Chang have what Jakarta called an unofficial meeting with Foreign Minister Ali Alatas on Wednesday . 
foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang , quoted by China &apos;s official Xinhua news agency , said Beijing had made &quot; serious representations &quot; to Jakarta over the Alatas-Chang meeting . 
Beijing exploded in fury at Washington and Taipei in June 1995 after Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui made a private U.S. visit . 
it also punished Ukraine in August after it allowed a secret visit by Taiwan Vice-President LIEN Chan . 
such &quot; holiday diplomacy &quot; by Taiwan &apos;s leaders boldly defies China &apos;s persistent calls for the island to halt its drive for a United Nations seat and a higher international profile . 
China has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since 1949 when the Nationalist Republic of China government lost their civil war to the communists and fled into exile on the island . 
Beijing has tried to isolate Taiwan , taking China &apos;s U.N. seat from Taipei in 1971 , refusing diplomatic ties with states recognising Taiwan , and blocking Taiwan &apos;s entry to international organisations . 
only 30 countries now recognise Taiwan . 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin , who has dropped Beijing &apos;s military intimidation of Taiwan in favour of a business-oriented peace offensive , made a new appeal to Taiwan on Friday . 
Jiang , also quoted by Xinhua , said he and other mainland leaders were willing to visit Taiwan -- but only if it abandons its attempts break out of diplomatic isolation . 
&quot; If the Taiwan authorities are indeed sincere about holding meetings , they should give up their political plot of creating two Chinas or one China , one Taiwan , &quot; Jiang was quoted by Xinhua as telling the French newspaper Le Figaro . 
&quot; Two Chinas &quot; and &quot; one China , one Taiwan &quot; are euphemisms for Taiwan &apos;s purported goal of independence from China , something Beijing vows to use force to prevent . 
Beijing and Taipei both espouse Taiwan &apos;s reunification with China , though on sharply different conditions . 
Taiwan demands political reforms and popular multiparty elections on the mainland , while Beijing has offered to let Taiwan keep its political system and even its armed forces as long as Taipei accepts the communist government &apos;s sovereignty .
