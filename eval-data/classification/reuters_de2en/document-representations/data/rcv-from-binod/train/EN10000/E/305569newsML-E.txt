Mexicans with tax arrears won some breathing space on Tuesday , when the government extended and amplified a program to give them more time and better conditions to pay their debts . 
at a high-profile ceremony launching the plan , President Ernesto Zedillo hailed it as one that would help the still-weak economy recover . 
&quot; This program will be very important for businesses which have run into problems in the last few years , &quot; Zedillo promised . 
&quot; It will help to consolidate the economic recovery . 
the government has embarked on a very public effort to persuade Mexicans , hard hit by a sharp economic downturn last year , to pay their taxes -- cracking down on and even arresting rich tax evaders , while warning ordinary Mexicans : &quot; Pay Your Taxes , Don &apos;t Pay the Consequences . 
the government &apos;s tax situation was thrown into chaos by last year &apos;s recession -- the worst in 50 years -- that followed a peso devaluation in December 1994 . 
the expanded program , which could benefit up to 900,000 people , will eliminate the 500,000 peso limit on tax arrears that was part of the original support program known as PROAFI . 
debtors have until July 31 to sign up and will be able to restructure their debts within a period of six years , instead of the 48 months under the previous PROAFI plan . 
the maximum interest rate will be reduced to five percent above the inflation-indexed UDI rate , with a maximum of a nominal annual rate of 25 percent , from the present nomimal annual rate of 30 percent . 
the UDI is a unit of investment , the value of which changes daily . 
debtors will also receive a discount when they pay off their debts within certain timeframes , the government said . 
finance Minister Ortiz told reporters the government had seen a more &quot; dynamic &quot; increase in tax recovery in the last few months . 
&quot; We have to underline that today &apos;s actions indicate that the Finance Ministry is interested not only in increasing its resources and deposits but also in offering aid to debtors so they can regularize their situations , &quot; Ortiz said . 
the cost of the program will not be more than 1.9 billion pesos , but the amount could be less depending on the number of people who take part in the program , and on the payments that are made in 1997 by those who want to take advantage of the discounts , the government said . 
Officals said the program will not have any extraordinary effect on the buget deficit this year . 
&quot; This ( the costs of the program ) was considered in the budget , &quot; Ortiz said . 
business leaders at the news conference praised the new program . 
&quot; It looks to us like a very effective measure to reduce the financial load on companies ... , &quot; said Carlos Abascal , president of one of the the top business groups , Coparmex .
