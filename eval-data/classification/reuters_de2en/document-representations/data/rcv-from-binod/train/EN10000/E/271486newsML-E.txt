the fortunes of Brazil &apos;s most famous jeweller H. Stern are rising as more Brazilian women can afford to adorn themselves with gold , diamonds , emeralds and other precious stones . 
thanks to the country &apos;s successful battle against inflation , Brazilians have more money to spend on luxury goods like jewellery , according to Hans Stern , the slight , bespectacled 76-year-old gentleman who presides over this glittering empire in the heart of Rio de Janeiro . 
H. Stern shops can be found in the United States , the Caribbean , most South American countries , Europe , Israel , Japan and , of course , Brazil . 
he politely refuses to reveal the exact extent of the company &apos;s wealth , but admits sales in Brazil have doubled since the government introduced the anti-inflation Real Plan in 1994 . 
&quot; We are not a public company so we don &apos;t have to disclose any figures . 
there is a lot of envy and jealousy in the world . 
why should we instigate that , &quot; Stern said . 
the success story of a German Jew , who fled the Nazi regime in 1939 and arrived almost penniless in Brazil only to become one of the top 10 jewellers in the world , is indeed astounding . 
what started off in a small office with only one assistant and $ 200 from the sale of an accordion brought from Germany has turned into an international operation with 175 outlets and 3,500 employees in 14 countries and a high-rise company headquarters in Rio &apos;s elegant Ipanema neighbourhood . 
H. Stern , which has mining rights for aquamarines and emeralds , is the only organisation of its kind , handling every aspect of gem production from mining to stone cutting , jewellery crafting and sales . 
business has been going well , with worldwide sales &quot; rising consistently &quot; every since H. Stern opened its doors to the public in 1945 . 
&quot; We don &apos;t really have any competitors , &quot; Stern said . 
&quot; We all have our own niche in the market . 
we distinguish ourselves as specialists in gem jewellery and try to develop new designs and collections to make Stern a brand name . 
H. Stern , which specialises in Brazil &apos;s vast variety of coloured gems , has cornered a 15 percent to 20 percent share in the domestic jewellery market estimated to be worth $ 1.1 billion a year and controls 60 percent of Brazilian gem production , making it the country &apos;s largest jeweller . 
no country in the world has as many different types of precious stone as Brazil . 
Brazil produces about 90 percent of the world &apos;s aquamarines , 75 percent of amethysts , tourmalines , citrines and other coloured gems and has displaced Colombia as the number one producer of emeralds . 
Brazil also produces five percent of the world &apos;s quality diamonds . 
coloured gems other than emeralds , rubies and sapphires are commonly known as semi-precious stones , but Stern , whose favourite gem is a green tourmaline , dismisses this terminology . 
after all , the single most expensive stone he has ever sold is an alexandrite for $ 350,000 . 
&quot; The word semi-precious is really taboo , &quot; he said . 
&quot; What makes a stone precious is its beauty , purity and durability . 
there are no half-precious stones , just as there are no half-pregnant women . 
it has been Stern &apos;s lifework to make Brazil famous for its coloured stones , which are appreciated more abroad than by Brazilians themselves who have a predilection for all things imported at the expense of the homegrown . 
however , Brazil is H. Stern &apos;s largest market with half of the company &apos;s stores and 70 percent of total revenues . 
Brazilians are responsible for 80 percent of sales in Brazil , while tourists account for the remaining 20 percent . 
Russians have displaced Arabs as the biggest spenders since the downfall of the Soviet Union , arriving with suitcases full of cash to buy the most extravagant pieces , while Americans are still the most eccentric . 
a gold dog collar with pink morganites to match the dog &apos;s skin ordered by an American woman sticks in Stern &apos;s mind as the most unusual order he ever received . 
such special orders account for 20 percent of total sales . 
but , it is the middle class buyer who purchases jewellery in the $ 200- $ 1,500 price range who makes up the bulk of H. Stern &apos;s clients . 
&quot; The market has become more popular and more democratic because you can buy jewellery from $ 100 up , &quot; Stern said . 
&quot; The fashion trend is toward simple straight lines using smaller stones , using gold and diamonds .
