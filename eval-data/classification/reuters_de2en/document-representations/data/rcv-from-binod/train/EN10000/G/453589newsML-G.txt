two French aid workers held by Afghanistan &apos;s purist Islamic Taleban militia were found guilty and released on Wednesday after a trial in Kabul . 
the two men , Frederic Michel and Daniel Llorente , who work for the Paris-based charity Action Contre la Faim ( ACF - Action Against Hunger ) , were sentenced by a three-man tribunal to one month in prison and ordered to leave the country . 
they flew to Islamabad on an aircraft of the International Committee of the Red Cross , unshaven , but cheerful and well . 
&quot; We are happy to be out , &quot; Michel told Reuters at the airport . 
their flight to freedom followed 26 days of captivity by the Taleban who had accused them of mixing with Afghan women . 
&quot; Frederic Robert Michel and Jose Daniel Llorente , by the decision of the court , will serve one month of imprisonment from the date of their detention , and also be given an order to leave the country , &quot; Judge Maulawi Gul Mohammed said after a three-hour hearing in the Afghan capital . 
the two men were freed immediately on the grounds that they had already been held for almost a month and allowed to travel to Islamabad with a delegation from the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) , which had interceded on their behalf . 
in Paris , French foreign ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt thanked the OIC and other groups who helped secure the releases . 
he also thanked the United Nations whose local delegate intervened with the OIC in favour of the Frenchmen . 
five Afghan staff who were arrested in connection with the same incident received sentences of 1-1 / 2 months imprisonment with between nine and 29 lashes each . 
the seven were arrested in connection with a farewell party given by the charity &apos;s female workers for their local women staff on February 21 . 
the Taleban , who since capturing Kabul last September have enforced their purist version of Islam , raided the party , arresting two local employees on the spot and seizing music cassettes , magazines , cameras and photographs . 
the other three local staff were arrested later , and the two Frenchmen early the next morning at a United Nations building where they were spending the night . 
in court on Wednesday the seven men were accused of a number of crimes , including being in the same house as Afghan women , taking pictures of Afghan women and having music and alcohol at the party . 
the defendants denied the charges . 
the United Nations , the OIC and the European Community protested against the arrest of the aid workers and called for their release . 
the deputy Secretary General of the OIC , Ibrahim al-Bakr , was in court in Wednesday to hear the verdict . 
he thanked the Taleban for what he called their leniency . 
&quot; The crimes of these young men deserve more punishment according to Islamic law , but because of the Taleban &apos;s tolerance and the mediation of the OIC , they have been kind enough to issue this clemency , not only for the two foreigners , but also for the Afghans , &quot; Bakr said . 
summing up , the judge said the fact two of the defendants were foreigners had persuaded the court to show clemency . 
&quot; Your crimes were very great , but considering that you are expatriates , the court has applied clemency in your case , &quot; he said . 
after the verdict Michel and Llorente told reporters they were thankful for the support they had received and relieved that their ordeal was over . 
it is a bit strange that it is all over , we were not really prepared , &quot; Llorente said . 
they said they had been generally treated well during the latter stages of their imprisonment . 
&quot; Except for the first days , it was almost nice . 
we had a heater , visits and letters . 
after the end of the initial interrogation we had very good treatment , &quot; Llorente added .
