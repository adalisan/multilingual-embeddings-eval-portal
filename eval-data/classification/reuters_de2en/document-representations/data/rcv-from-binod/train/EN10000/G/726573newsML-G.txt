the U.N. war crimes tribunal sentenced Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic to a 20-year prison term on Monday for his part in a vicious &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; campaign against Moslem civilians in 1992 . 
Tadic , 41 , a former police reservist nicknamed &quot; Dusko &quot; , was given a total of 97 years on 11 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes , but the sentences will run concurrently with the longest single term . 
he received the heaviest sentence , of 20 years , under an umbrella persecution charge covering beatings , torture and two brutal murders of Bosnian Moslems during the early stages of Bosnia &apos;s 1992-95 war . 
&quot; You committed these crimes with intention and with sadistic brutality using knives , iron bars , the butt of a pistol , sticks and ... in one case tightening a noose around the victim &apos;s neck until he lost consciousness , &quot; presiding judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United States said . 
the trial chamber recommended the sentence should not be commuted or otherwise reduced to less than 10 years . 
the court &apos;s decision drew an angry response from Bosnia , where it was condemned as a political act and a sham . 
&quot; This is a political sentence ... We are very bitter that care was not taken to put this trial on a better political foundation , &quot; Momcilo Krajisnik , Serb member of Bosnia &apos;s post war multi-ethnic presidency told journalists in Banja Luka . 
McDonald said Tadic showed a pattern of cruel and brutal conduct against his Moslem former friends and neighbours during a purge by Serb nationalist forces of Moslem and Croat inhabitants of the Prijedor area of northwestern Bosnia in 1992 . 
Tadic , dressed in a dark blue jacket and tie , looked pale and shaken as the sentence was read out . 
he waved briefly to supporters in the public gallery as he was led away . 
he had faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment , the term demanded by the tribunal &apos;s prosecutors . 
the court cannot impose a death penalty . 
a former bar owner and father of two girls , Tadic has already spent three years in custody since his arrest in Germany . 
he has consistently denied the charges and his lawyers have lodged an appeal against the verdict and intend to appeal against the sentence . 
&quot; We are disappointed , I think it is a very severe sentence , &quot; Tadic &apos;s lawyer Nikola Kostich said . 
&quot; What the court does is place Mr Tadic at the top of the ladder ... The fact is that he was a very small player . 
Monday &apos;s sentencing was the first after a full-length trial since the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) was established by the U.N. Security Council in May 1993 . 
the tribunal &apos;s prosecutors welcomed the sentence , saying it marked a significant step in the court &apos;s work . 
the tribunal has issued indictments against 77 suspects -- most of them Serbs -- to date . 
but only 10 indictees , including Tadic , are in the tribunal &apos;s custody at its 24-cell detention unit in The Hague . 
but NATO-led peacekeeping troops in Bosnia appear to have begun a more active pursuit of fugitive war-crimes indictees after years of criticism that they were doing little to support the tribunal &apos;s quest for justice . 
last week , crack British troops in Prijedor shot dead regional police chief Simo Drljaca after he resisted capture and arrested hospital director Milan Kovacevic . 
both were the subject of secret tribunal indictments in connection with the 1992 events in Prijedor . 
Kovacevic is now jailed in The Hague awaiting trial . 
the NATO swoop stirred speculation that the two most wanted war-crimes indictees -- former Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic and military chief General Ratko Mladic -- may also be snatched soon . 
the U.N. tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda mark the first attempt to try war criminals before a panel of judges since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials after World War Two . 
where Tadic will serve his sentence remains unresolved . 
only two countries , Italy and Finland , have signed agreements offering to house convicted war criminals , but nine others have expressed willingness to do so .
