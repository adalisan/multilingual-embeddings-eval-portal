&quot; At this meeting , VEB reported that significant progress has been made in the reconciliation of eligible debt , &quot; Deutsche said . 
one banking source said the rescheduling was now well on the way to being finalised in the foreseeable future . 
Deutsche said VEB had reported that it had acknowledged about 80 percent of banks &apos; claims and that creditors had returned signed reconcilation statements of just under 20 percent of eligible debt , thereby approving the reconciliation . 
the VEB urged creditor banks to return their signed reconciliation statements as soon as possible , even where statements included unreconciled as well as reconciled claims . 
Deutsche said VEB and the Bank Advisory Committee had agreed to assist creditors to facilitate the reconciliation process . 
last month a senior Russian finance ministry official said Russia plans to sign the agreement rescheduling the London Club debt by June 30 . 
the agreement , made in principle two years ago , sketched plans for repayment of $ 25.5 billion of principal over 25 years and $ 7 billion in past-due interest over 20 years .
