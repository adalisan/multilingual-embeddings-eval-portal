Pakistan &apos;s newly elected government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif faces a tough task in grappling with runaway inflation and a stubborn trade gap , according to a research report received on Monday . 
the report , by ANB AMRO Bank N.V. , said Pakistan had little choice but to put state-owned assets on the block in a bid to attract non-interest bearing inflows of foreign currency . 
the report said a poor cotton crop and heavy taxes imposed on the manufacturing sector might restrict real gross domestic product growth to 4.5 percent in 1996 / 97 ( July-June ) . 
GDP grew 6.1 percent in fiscal 1995 / 96 , up from 4.4 percent the previous year . 
government officials have scaled back estimates of the 1996 / 97 cotton crop to nine million bales from earlier forecasts of 10 million because of pest damage in late 1996 . 
the 1995 / 96 crop reached 9.96 million bales . 
the ABN AMRO report said the official inflation rate could rise well above 13 percent , despite desperate efforts of the State ( central ) Bank of Pakistan ( SBP ) to keep credit expansion within targets set in the revised credit plan for 1996 / 97 . 
the SBP said in a statement after the central bank &apos;s board of directors met in Lahore on Thursday that government borrowing for budgetary support was &quot; very excessive . 
&quot; It being an unsustainable situation from the point of view of monetary stability , balance of payment viability , credit availability for the private sector and the object of containment of inflation , the board urged that steps be taken to contain government borrowing , &quot; the statement said . 
SBP gave no figures for public domestic borrowing , but bankers said they believed it exceeded 70 billion rupees ( $ 1.74 billion ) against a whole-year target of 20 billion . 
&quot; Given this monetary overhang , it is expected that domestic credit expansion will continue to be closely monitored , &quot; ABN AMRO said , but efforts to reduce aggregate demand were unlikely to curb inflation arising from last year &apos;s rupee devaluation . 
Pakistan slashed 17.14 percent off the rupee &apos;s dollar value in calendar 1996 , including a 7.86 percent devaluation on October 22 . 
the report said Pakistan needed to resolve its trade deficit which has increasingly been financed by drawing down foreign exchange reserves or borrowing from the international market . 
it said financing the monthly trade imbalance was becoming more difficult in the face of soaring foreign debt repayments . 
&quot; In fact , during the month of December , imports of petroleum and edible oils had been financed by short-term borrowing to reduce the drain on Pakistan &apos;s reserves , &quot; it said . 
Pakistan faces foreign debt repayments totalling $ 1.5 billion in March to June , not including payment on military debt , while bankers say the trade gap will reach $ 2.8 billion to 3.0 billion in 1996 / 97 , compared to $ 3.66 billion in 1995 / 96 . 
foreign exchange reserves , excluding bullion , rose to $ 1.068 billion on February 27 from $ 850 million on February 20 . 
&quot; Although the immediate foreign exchange crunch is over , Pakistan still finds itself heavily dependent on short-term inflows to meet its current liabilities , &quot; the report said . 
analysts say Pakistan has assets worth $ 60 billion to $ 70 billion . 
raising $ 10 billion through privatisation could relieve the country of the most expensive part of its $ 30 billion foreign debt and bring down annual debt servicing by 40 percent .
