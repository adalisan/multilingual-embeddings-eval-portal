early elections in Japan appeared certain after two cabinet ministers said on Friday Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto will probably dissolve parliament on September 27 . 
Hashimoto agreed on Thursday with the leaders of the two junior parties in his ruling coalition to convene an extraordinary session of parliament on September 27 , but has remained mum about whether he will call snap polls . 
&quot; It is very probable that the parliament will be dissolved ( at the beginning of the session ) , &quot; Minister of International Trade and Industry Shunpei Tsukahara told reporters . 
Tsukahara , a member of Hashimoto &apos;s Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) appeared to endorse the almost daily media reports that the prime minister would dissolve parliament on the first day of the session and hold general elections on October 20 . 
most observers say the prime minister is balancing competing demands from the LDP , which is keen on early polls , and its coalition partners the Social Democratic Party and Sakigake , which want to put off elections until next year . 
but Finance Minister Wataru Kubo , who is also a senior Social Democratic Party official , told a news conference , &quot; I suspect this will proceed as reported by various media . 
polls are not mandated until July 1997 , but the LDP favours going before voters as early as possible before April , when an unpopular rise in the consumption tax , approved by the Hashimoto government , takes effect . 
the junior coalition parties want more time because they are locked in a bitter row over how to regroup for the coming polls , which will be held under a revised electoral system thought to favour large groupings . 
analysts say rump versions of those parties -- or the nascent Democratic Party , formed mainly of defectors from Sakigake and the Social Democrats -- will be the LDP &apos;s most likely coalition partner if it falls short of a majority . 
the LDP has been projected to get the most votes in the election , but it may not capture a majority in the 500-seat Lower House of parliament . 
a public opinion survey this week by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun , a leading financial daily , gave the LDP the highest approval rating with 22.4 percent , while Sakigake scored just 1.2 percent and the Social Democrats 3.7 percent . 
Shinshinto ( New Frontier Party ) , the main opposition group , polled only 6.5 percent in the survey , trailing even the 7.8 percent pollsters gave the Democratic Party , which will be formed later this month . 
but a senior Shinshinto official told reporters this week that his party would prevail despite gloomy predictions , because it remained the only alternative to the status-quo oriented LDP . 
Shinshinto President Ichiro Ozawa , the party &apos;s prime minister hopeful , on Friday told visiting Australian Prime Minister John Howard , &quot; We want to win the general election in order to address the problems of the tax system as well as administrative and political reforms . 
most pundits predict issueless , do-or-die races for the 300 seats in the lower chamber to be contested in first-past-the-post constituencies , introduced under 1994 electoral reforms . 
the remaining 200 seats will be contested by proportional representation . 
&quot; The election is likely to bring bloodshed among politicians , &quot; said Jesper Koll , chief economist at JP Morgan . 
&quot; We have got 950 candidates running for 300 seats . 
as a result of that , two-thirds are not going to make it .
