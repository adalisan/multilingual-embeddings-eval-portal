Paris Saint-Germain snatched back the lead in the French division from Monaco when they came from behind to beat lowly Caen 3-1 away on Friday . 
with Brazilian Leonardo inspirational in midfield , PSG scored through Panama &apos;s Julio Cesar Dely Valdes , his eighth league goal of the season , and France midfielders Vincent Guerin and Bruno N &apos;Gotty . 
&quot; Mission accomplished , but with some scares and a team that only found itself after half an hour , &quot; said PSG executive director Michel Denisot . 
&quot; It &apos;s a very good result for us in difficult conditions for good football , &quot; he added after a match played in pouring rain . 
&quot; The championship is going to be hard fought up to the last day with Monaco , Bordeaux and Auxerre , who are also in the fight whatever their coach says . 
Monaco won 1-0 at Montpellier on Thursday night to hold a two-point lead for 24 hours but PSG have now 42 points to Monaco &apos;s 41 after 20 matches . 
Chadian playmaker Japhet N &apos;Doram missed a twice taken penalty but ended up with a hat-trick as Nantes crushed 10-man Cannes 5-1 to become the biggest scorers in the division with 37 goals , one more than Monaco . 
Cannes were down to 10 men from late in the first half when defender David Jemmali was sent off for a second bookable offence . 
with the score still 0-0 after more than half an hour N &apos;Doram missed the first penalty kick after he had been brought down but the refree ordered a retake because of encroachment by Cannes players . 
N &apos;Doram had his second spot kick parried by goalkeeper Francois Lemasson but netted the rebound . 
the Chadian added further goals in the 50th and 89th minutes while team mates Claude Makelele and Jocelyn Gourvennec also found the net as Nantes climbed to 10th after equalling PSG &apos;s record run of 13 games unbeaten this season . 
Nancy &apos;s Gregory Wimbee became the first goalkeeper to score in the French first division in open play for 15 years when he came up to snatch a last gasp equaliser from a corner in a 1-1 draw against Lens . 
Nancy squandered a first half penalty and one in four has been in the first division so far this season . 
Strasbourg striker David Zitelli was the only player to convert a penalty of the three awarded to help his side beat Lyon 3-0 and climb to third equal with Bordeaux on 34 points . 
Zitelli scored twice , curling his first goal straight in from a corner kick , to join Rennes &apos; Stephane Guivarc &apos;h as the division &apos;s leading marksmen with 14 each . 
Guivarc &apos;h hit his side &apos;s only goal in a 3-1 defeat by bottom club Nice who won for the first time in 10 games . 
Rennes are the worst travellers with only two points out of a possible 33 away . 
champions Auxerre rose one place to sixth with their first league win in five matches , 1-0 away to Lille with a goal by striker Lilian Laslandes . 
they play their final European champions &apos; league game at home to Glasgow Rangers on Wednesday . 
&quot; We &apos;re off again . 
our injured players worked well in solitude , allowing them to come back a bit sooner , &quot; said Auxerre coach Guy Roux . 
&quot; It was very important to win . 
Bastia and Metz lost and we have recovered a bit of ground , which will add some spice to our match with Bordeaux next week . 
but let &apos;s not get carried away , it was a match of convalescents . 
Midfielders Sabri Lamouchi and Antoine Sibierksi , who were both coming back from injury , played for only 60 and 30 minutes respectively . 
Bastia dropped to fifth as Guingamp ended their run of four wins in a row with a 2-1 home victory .
