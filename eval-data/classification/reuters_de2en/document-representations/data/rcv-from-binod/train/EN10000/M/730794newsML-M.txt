abundant supplies and low prices of diesel in Asia have triggered a rare flow of the product to South America which could resuscitate the ailing market if it continues , traders said on Tuesday . 
&quot; Everybody is looking at the same thing in light of the dull China market and lack of demand from India ... You have to look elsewhere , &quot; said a U.S. refiner . 
&quot; It depends on the freight , there may be some ships around that may be able to give us a good rate , &quot; he said . 
Asian gas oil prices hit a three-year low of $ 19.80 per barrel last week , sparking the search by sellers for markets outside of Asia . 
so far three 40,000-tonne diesel cargoes have been sold to a European trader with strong market links to South America , for delivery in August . 
a European major oil company sold two cargoes to the trader -- a 0.25-percent sulphur diesel cargo for delivery to Argentina and a 0.5-percent sulphur cargo for delivery to Paraguay . 
another 0.25 percent sulphur cargo was sold by a South Korean refiner for delivery to Argentina . 
traders said the 0.5 percent diesel grade was sold at discount levels to Singapore spot quotes , while the 0.25 percent grade was sold at a 45-cent premium , both on a free-on-board ( fob ) basis . 
&quot; People are getting excited about this , &quot; said a trader with a Japanese firm . 
&quot; As far as I could recall this is the first time that such a thing has happened . 
Argentina traditionally buys from Northwest Europe , the Mediterranean and the United States , traders said . 
Asian supplies have become more attractive because they are easily available at low prices , while freight is easily available also . 
although supplies from the Middle East are about $ 1.30 per barrel cheaper than Asia , its prompt supplies are limited because refiners there have committed their supplies in advance , while prices in the U.S. and Europe are not as attractive . 
but Asian refiners have to contend with Mediterranean supplies which are about $ 1.00 cheaper , currently between $ 20.00- $ 20.50 per barrel , on an fob basis . 
however , some traders said they were not convinced that demand in the Latin continent would remain strong enough to enable a continuous flow . 
&quot; I am not sure how long this will carry on , &quot; a trader with a European company said . 
&quot; Demand there is not big . 
the harvest season which is sparking Argentina &apos;s purchases will end soon . 
he noted that there was no incremental demand from South America . 
the trader also said the best hope for Asian sellers was for Brazil to start seeking diesel cargoes from this region . 
&quot; Brazil &apos;s requirement is large but they don &apos;t have much incremental demand , &quot; he said . 
&quot; If the economics work , they might try to source from elsewhere and if they start sourcing from the East , it would be a significant boost to the Asian market . 
but as Brazil normally ships diesel in its own tankers , the chances of sending vessels to East Asia are slim and it would go only as far as the Mediterranean and Red Sea , he added .
