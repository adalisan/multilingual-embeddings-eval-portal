European crude markets are due a respite this week after a recent heavy battering which has driven prices into contango but traders said any gains will be modest as sour supply rises and Brent sales into the U.S. struggle . 
may Brent crude futures shed over $ 1.70 a barrel last week , suffering from slack spring demand and ample supply from all regions , but spot North Sea differentials recorded narrow improvements in most cases and even sour Russian Urals steadied . 
traders said the chances of further consolidation this week rest heavily on the fate of a handful of April 10-20 Brent cargoes held by Shell and the willingness of refiners to buy oil for storage , taking advantage of a deepening contango . 
&quot; It really depends what happens to these Brents , &quot; said a trader at a northwest European refinery . 
&quot; It won &apos;t go roaring up but we won &apos;t see May Brent -95 cents trade again for dated , &quot; he said . 
last week , dated Brent traded a range between 90 cents and $ 1 below May forward paper , pegging the benchmark grade at around $ 16.78 a barrel on Friday , its cheapest price for over 12 months . 
this week &apos;s Brent contracts for difference ( CFDs ) valued Brent at June Brent -94 cents , equivalent to May -72 cents . 
but despite Shell &apos;s attempts to sell Brent into the U.S. Gulf , traders expect most , if not all of the eight the major bought from BP last week to remain in Europe , some within the owner &apos;s system and others on the spot market . 
&quot; I think we &apos;ll see some Brent moving in the ( May Brent ) -80s , lower than the CFDs suggest but not as weak as it was , &quot; said a trader . 
Brent apart , most other North Sea crudes should hold the 10-15 cent gains posted last week but upside potential is limited . 
a spate of deals on Friday showed refineries picking up Oseberg and Forties at substantially narrower discounts to dated Brent than earlier in the week , encouraged by the contango . 
&quot; If you &apos;ve got storage capacity you can print money at these levels , &quot; said a trader . 
&quot; May Brent less 90 cents is cheap oil , you can store that and make money but it doesn &apos;t take that much unsold oil to keep things low in this market , &quot; said another trader . 
nevertheless , softer North Sea freight rates , and the removal of a Norwegian strike threat could prevent differentials for the offshore grades moving much higher , traders said . 
the prospect of increasing supply of sour crude , with Baghdad set to export at least 430,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) of Kirkuk Blend this month from the Turkish port of Ceyhan , up from 300,000 bpd in March , should also keep a firm lid on regional crude differentials in the Mediterranean , traders said . 
rival Russian Urals -- valued at dated Brent - $ 1.40 a barrel last week -- could draw support from an 80-hour pipeline closure at the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk due to start on Tuesday . 
but with Iraqi sales set to rise further to meet the oil-for-food cash target in a falling market , traders believe the breather will be short-lived .
