Ugandan First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Eriya Kategaya has arrived in Tehran to sign a final Iranian-brokered peace agreement with Sudan , the official Iranian news agency IRNA reported on Sunday . 
IRNA quoted Kategaya as saying upon arrival in Tehran on Saturday night that he hoped Iran &apos;s mediation will help Uganda and Sudan &quot; reach agreement on ways of supervising the peace agreement &quot; agreed between the two African countries in September to resolve border tensions between them . 
&quot; The agreement is to be signed by foreign ministers of Sudan and Uganda in Tehran , &quot; IRNA said . 
officials had said the signing was scheduled for Monday . 
representatives of both countries held talks in Tehran in October to follow up on the agreement under which Sudan and Uganda , which accuse each other of supporting anti-government rebels , agreed to halt their activities in the border area . 
Malawi , which has mediated in the past between Sudan and Uganda , is expected to attend the signing , IRNA said . 
Sudan said October it was abiding by the agreement with Uganda and that a monitoring group would soon start work to ensure that neither government helps rebels in the border area . 
under the September agreement , the two governments also agreed to stop hostile propaganda campaigns , destroy rebel positions and supply centres , move all refugees and rebels at least 100 km ( 60 miles ) inside the border and encourage the voluntary repatriation of refugees from the two countries .
