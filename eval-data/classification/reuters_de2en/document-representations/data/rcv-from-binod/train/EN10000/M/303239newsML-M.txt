Belgian shares pushed into unchartered territory on Monday , setting an all-time record high close as investors flocked to the market confident that the bourse could rise further in coming weeks . 
&quot; There is no reason for the market to come back down , the dollar is strong , rates are good , fundamentals are good and there &apos;s a lot of derivative products on the Belgian market , &quot; said trader Paul de Lophem at brokerage Mignon , Hanart , Declerck . 
the blue-chip Bel-20 index closed up 1.57 percent , or 30.57 points , at 1,975.56 . 
&quot; Maybe the sky &apos;s the limit but we &apos;ll certainly reach 2,000 by the end of the week , &quot; de Lophem said . 
trader Benoit Kint at Petercam said guaranteed index funds had helped push the bourse higher . 
dealers said industrial stocks remained the main attraction on the Bel-20 index with chemicals firm Solvay climbing an impressive 5.58 percent to close at 21,750 francs . 
&quot; Chemical prices are up , the dollar effect and the acquisition ( 60 percent stake in Bulgarian soda producer SODI ) led to the fantastic rise we &apos;ve seen , &quot; said analyst Jurgen Fryges at KB-Securities . 
dealers said pharmaceutical products Solvay was developing had further tempted investors to pick up the stock . 
de Lophem said Solvay &apos;s anti-depression drug Flesinoxan could compete with the blockbuster drug Prozac in the U.S. 
chemicals and drugs group UCB gained 1.65 percent to close at 86,400 francs . 
&quot; We think UCB will remain strong because of its blockbuster product Zyrtec , &quot; said another trader . 
he added that UCB could reach 100,000 francs once it made an annoucement on when it would receive approval to sell Zyrtec in Japan , the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world . 
retailer Delhaize pushed higher on the back of a strong dollar and investors &apos; confidence in the cyclical stock . 
it closed up 2.27 percent to 2,030 francs with a high volume of 184,462 shares traded . 
oil and chemicals firm Petrofina was up 2.05 percent at 11,225 francs , lifted by the strong dollar . 
brokerage Vermeulen-Raemdonck said in its weekly market report on Friday that it rated Petrofina a buy ( 11,000 BEF ) .
