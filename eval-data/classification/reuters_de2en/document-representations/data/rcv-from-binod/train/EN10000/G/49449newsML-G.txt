Saddam Hussein has wrested back control of northern Iraq for the first time in five years , isolated Washingon from most of its Gulf War allies , and defiantly withstood two waves of punitive missile strikes . 
the Iraqi leader could be forgiven for sitting back to relish his success and gloat at his opponents &apos; disarray . 
but instead , Saddam appears ready to risk all by goading the United States once more into military action . 
undaunted by overwhelming U.S. weapons superiority , he told Iraqi pilots and anti-aircraft gunners to shoot down Western planes flying over his country and declared invalid the &quot; no-fly zones &quot; they have been patrolling . 
so why is Saddam still spoiling for a fight ? 
to the West , Saddam &apos;s defiant rhetoric may be one more sign of his unshakeable belligerence . 
but Iraqi exiles in Jordan said that challenging the no-fly zones , set up by Western allies after Iraq &apos;s 1991 Gulf War defeat , was crucial to erasing Saddam &apos;s memory of military humiliation at the hands of the U.S.-led military coalition . 
&quot; He is trying to regain his dignity and his sovereignty , &quot; said Saad al-Bazzaz , a former editor of the government daily newspaper al-Jumhouriya who fled Baghdad four years ago . 
but his mentality is different . 
he doesn &apos;t believe in limited success , &quot; said Bazzaz . 
&quot; First he returned to Kurdistan . 
now he has to break the no-fly zone . 
Iraqi opposition figures in Jordan , frustrated by the limited international response to Saddam &apos;s foray into Kurdish territory , said the U.S. strikes last week had emboldened the Iraqi president to further test Washington &apos;s resolve . 
&quot; The U.S. reaction was weak , and the missiles didn &apos;t touch his troops in the north , &quot; said a member of the Iraqi National Accord , the first Iraqi opposition group to be formally established in Jordan . 
&quot; Based on that experience , Saddam thinks that any new blows would not be serious , &quot; he added . 
&quot; He won a strategic victory in the north ... and emerged unscathed , &quot; said another exile . 
&quot; ( But ) the most important thing for him is to be seen to be standing up to the might ( of America ) . 
Western diplomats said they were not surprised by the latest display of brinkmanship from Saddam , who led Iraq into a ruinous eight-year war with Iran before his 1990 invasion of Kuwait . 
&quot; He &apos;s made illogical and unpredictable decisions before , &quot; said one . 
&quot; In this case , he &apos;s just following up a pledge to resist the no-fly zones . 
that pledge led Iraqi gunners on Wednesday to fire on U.S. F-16 jets overflying northern Iraq , unleashing an exchange of bellicose threats between Baghdad and the Pentagon . 
U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry said the attack would draw a &quot; disproportionate &quot; response . 
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz on Thursday said Kuwait &apos;s readiness to let U.S. planes fly from its territory was &quot; an act of war &quot; . 
later on Thursday , Iraq said its air defence units fired three missiles at U.S. and allied warplanes patrolling the no-fly zone in the south , forcing them to flee . 
but the opposition groups said anything less than an all-out U.S. strike against Saddam &apos;s hold on power would just encourage him to keep chipping away at Western resolve to hold him at bay . 
&quot; He will do his best to shoot down an American plane , and he doesn &apos;t care about the cost , &quot; Bazzaz said .
