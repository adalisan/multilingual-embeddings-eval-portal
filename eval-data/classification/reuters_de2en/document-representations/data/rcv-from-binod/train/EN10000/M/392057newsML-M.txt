* Stocks end lower as profit-takers cash in , bonds slide with future-linked selling . 
no impact from Deng death . 
a combination of a battered bond market and profit-taking after its recent record breaking run pushed the Australian share market to a lower close on Thursday . 
the death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping had no impact on the local market , traders said . 
&quot; It was nothing to be concerned about . 
it was more curiosity value than anything else , &quot; said a Sydney-based dealer . 
the March share price index futures contract was 19 points lower at 2,474 , a 2.3 point discount to the underlying index . 
China-related stocks ended mixed in mostly thin trade after the announcement of Deng &apos;s death . 
brokers noted that trading in that sector of the market was usually choppy and illiquid with over half of the companies making up the Australian Stock Exchange &apos;s Asian index untraded on the day . 
China Construction Holdings eased four cents to 85 cents while OLS Asia Holdings ended unchanged at 80 cents , as did Jardine Fleming China Region at 61 cents while NMFM Asia Investments lost a cent to close at 87 cents . 
profit taking in the big banks , particularly in Commonwealth Bank of Australia and National Australia Bank which both lost over 1.5 percent to A $ 13.33 and A $ 16.64 respectively , pressured the leaders right from the start . 
an afternoon slide in bond futures then exacerbated softer sentiment on the day , generating selling in the March SPI contract that flowed into the underlying markets . 
&quot; The futures have been knocked about a bit today , &quot; said dealer Jamie Spiteri of Shaw stockbroking , noting that the underlying market &apos;s showing had been a continuation of the slide started on Wednesday afternoon . 
&quot; In the last hour of trading yesterday , our market was on a downward slide and that has continued as the day &apos;s gone on here . 
really , this is the aftermath of what has been a pretty solid couple of weeks , there is no specific reason for it . 
results remained the focus with plenty reported today . 
shares of Burns Philp and Co ended five cents lower at A $ 2.09 after the food ingredients group reported a 17.6 percent rise in first half net profit to A $ 48.2 million . 
construction group Leighton lost 15 cents to A $ 5.70 despite an 18 percent higher first half net profit of A $ 32.04 million and 42 percent higher dividend . 
Qantas Airways reported a 2.4 percent higher first half net profit of A $ 151.6 million . 
Sydney Harbour casino shares topped turnover with 27.5 million shares traded , the bulk of it in two lines specialled through Merrill Lynch . 
by 5.00 p.m. ( 0600 GMT ) , 10 year T-bonds were yielding 7.44 percent , well up on Wednesday &apos;s 7.30 percent levels . 
the Australian dollar kept a grip on 1 / 2 cent of offshore gains late Thursday but was finding it hard to extend the rally into safer territory atop 77 cents . 
traders said heavy buying , some options related and some from a U.K. corporate , had soaked up impressive amounts of sales and squeezed the currency up from US $ 0.7635 support .
