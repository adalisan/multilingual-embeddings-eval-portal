the former prisoner of war nominated to be the first U.S. ambassador to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam vowed on Thursday to help foster trade , promote stability in Southeast Asia and try to bind old war wounds . 
the nominee , former Representative Douglas &quot; Pete &quot; Peterson , a Florida Democrat , said that if confirmed as expected he hoped to &quot; play a critical and constructive role in helping our nation mend further &quot; from the war that ended with a communist victory in 1975 . 
he said a U.S. ambassadorial presence in Hanoi &quot; can help ensure regional stability in Southeast Asia and we will undoubtedly discover new economic opportunities for American businesses where few previously existed . 
fallout from the war and the deep divisions it sowed in U.S society swirled through Peterson &apos;s remarks , made at the start of his long-delayed confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . 
several senators , including John McCain , an Arizona Republican who was also a prisoner of war in Vietnam , used the hearing to denounce charges that normalisation of ties with Hanoi may have been influenced by campaign contributions to President Bill Clinton and the Democratic National Committee . 
McCain , a frequent critic of Clinton &apos;s foreign policies who spearheaded calls for an independent counsel to probe improper fund-raising by Clinton &apos;s 1996 re-election campaign , noted that he had been deeply involved in administration discussions of steps toward normalisation . 
&quot; I firmly believe that the president made this difficult decision on the merits , &quot; he said . 
&quot; He believed that normalisation was in the best interests of the United States . 
he was right . 
he made a hard , but wise decision which he sincerely believed would cost him politically . 
he acted like a statesman and he earned my respect . 
Senator John Kerry , a Massachussetts Democrat who is also a Vietnam veteran , endorsed McCain &apos;s statement . 
he pointed out that he and McCain had teamed up to provide the bipartisan political cover Clinton sought before lifting a decades-old trade embargo against Hanoi and , in July 1995 , establishing diplomatic ties . 
in his testimony , Peterson said his highest priority would be getting the fullest possible accounting for the 1,594 Americans still listed as missing in action or otherwise unaccounted for in Vietnam , the issue that has dogged relations more than any other since the war . 
&quot; Many of those still missing are personal friends of mine , all were with me , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I assure you , I will do whatever possible to exploit every opportunity to achieve that noble goal at the earliest time possible . 
&quot; Throughout Southeast Asia , the Pentagon listed 2,133 unresolved missing in action ( MIA ) cases as of the end of January . 
Peterson &apos;s involvement with Vietnam began 30 years ago as an Air Force fighter pilot flying daily combat missions from bases in Thailand . 
on Sept . 10 , 1966 , on his 67th mission , his aircraft was downed near Hanoi . 
he spent six and a half years in detention . 
Peterson , who served in the House of Representatives for six years , would be the first U.S. ambassador posted to Hanoi , which overran the U.S.-backed Saigon government in April 1975 . 
the politically potent American Legion , the largest U.S. veterans &apos; group with 3.1 million members , said in a letter made available on Thursday it opposed confirming an ambassador until Hanoi was &quot; fully forthcoming &quot; on the missing . 
responding to critics who oppose upgrading relations to ambassadorial level chiefly over the issue of the MIAs , Peterson said the nearly 400 U.S. companies vying for contracts in Vietnam were at a &quot; distinct disadvantage &quot; because the United States had not yet fully normalised economic relations .
