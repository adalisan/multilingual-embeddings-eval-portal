the last physical relic of China &apos;s paramount leader Deng Xiaoping that will not vanish with his death -- his corneas -- have gone to China &apos;s premier eye hospital , medical officials said on Monday . 
&quot; Our whole hospital is very moved by this , &quot; said one nurse at the Tongren hospital in central Beijing , China &apos;s most prestigious eye hospital and keeper of the capital &apos;s only eye bank . 
&quot; Deng &apos;s corneas are here , &quot; she said on Monday , speaking as the rest of the patriarch &apos;s body was being cremated at the Babaoshan cemetery in western Beijing . 
&quot; We hope they will provide hope and light for our future , &quot; she said . 
it was not known whether the corneas of Deng , who died last Wednesday aged 92 , would in fact be used . 
&quot; Comrade Xiaoping &apos;s corneas should be donated to an eye bank and his body be dissected for the purpose of medical research , &quot; his family wrote in a letter just before his death , in line with his own wishes for his funeral . 
Deng &apos;s ashes are to be scattered at sea . 
the man whose capitalist-style reforms and open-door policy transformed an isolated Stalinist state into a fledgling world superpower had always abhorred the near-hysterical cult of personality that surrounded his predecessor Mao Zedong . 
he had requested a simple funeral . 
his decision to donate his corneas to an eye bank has inspired 440 people in the central city of Nanjing to follow his example , Shanghai &apos;s Wen Hui Bao newspaper said on Monday . 
the volunteers , aged from 20 to 88 , had offered to donate their body parts to medical research , the newspaper said . 
Chinese people traditionally prefer to be buried whole , a preference that has led to difficulty in securing body parts for life-saving operations such as kidney transplants .
