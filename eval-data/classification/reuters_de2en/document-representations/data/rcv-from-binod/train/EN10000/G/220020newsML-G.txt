Colombia &apos;s seemingly uncontrolled level of violence has spilled into the country &apos;s state-run schools , with students apparently issuing death threats to get higher grades , union officials said on Tuesday . 
Boris Montes , president of the Colombian Federation of Teachers , told a news conference there had been numerous cases in cities such as Bogota and Medellin of students brandishing weapons or issuing death threats to force frightened teachers into giving them better grades . 
Medellin has what has often been described as the highest murder rate in the Western Hemisphere , and Bogota comes a close second . 
&quot; There has to be a consensus so that students understand they will promoted from one grade to another on their own merits and not through threats , &quot; said Montes . 
&quot; School should be a place where citizens are formed in an environment of tolerance , co-existence and respect for fundamental rights , &quot; he added , saying the government appeared indifferent to the growing level of violence in state-run schools , especially in Colombia &apos;s inner cities . 
Montes said more than 100 members of his union had reported receiving death threats over the first 10 months of the year . 
forty others were killed during the same time period , he added , saying leftist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitary groups were believed responsible for at least some of the killings .
