Brazil stocks fell 2.21 percent Friday on profit-taking triggered by a rout on Wall Street , and analysts said they expected trade to be nervous again next week . 
&quot; Wall Street was the single most important factor influencing local prices , &quot; said a Rio de Janeiro trader . 
the Bovespa index of 49 most-traded stocks ended at 9,518 points , down 215 points on the day . 
traders said the Brazilian bourse felt the aftershocks of U.S. market turmoil on data that could weigh in favor of a new hike in U.S. interest rates . 
Bellwether Telebras preferred ended down 2.65 percent at 117.30 reais . 
analysts said Friday &apos;s market was also influenced by the habitual wrangling between short and long positions ahead of the options settlement on April 22 . 
the settlement could add an element of tension to trade next week as well . 
traders said Eletrobras and Petrobras prices were hit by a newspaper report which said the government was considering accepting Companhia Vale do Rio Doce common shares from minority stockholders , and exchanging them for stock in the two energy companies . 
while government officials refused to confirm the report , traders said the news was credible . 
they said the government is probably trying to neutralize pension funds , the biggest minority holders of CVRD stock , at the April 29 CVRD privatization . 
minority holders will be allowed to simultaneously offer their stock at the auction and sell it ahead of the government &apos;s stake . 
traders said the government may fear it will not be able to sell the minimum 40 percent tranche needed for the privatization to be valid if the pension funds , which control a 15 percent block , aggressively offer their stake . 
Eletrobras common stock fell 2.73 percent to 462.00 . 
Petrobras common dropped 3.03 percent to 160 reais .
