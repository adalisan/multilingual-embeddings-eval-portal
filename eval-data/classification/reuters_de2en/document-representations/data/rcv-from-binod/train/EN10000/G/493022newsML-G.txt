London marathon organisers said on Tuesday that it was unlikely that there would be any additional security measures for Sunday &apos;s race . 
&quot; We have lived with these issues for several years and have contingency plans in place to deal with any situation , &quot; said London Marathon chief executive Nick Bitel . 
last Saturday , the Grand National horse race was postponed after a hoax bomb warning from the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) . 
Bitel pointed out that the London Marathon had faced security issues in the past and that they had not affected the race . 
&quot; We have had a year to get ready for the marathon and will do whatever is necessary to maintain public order and safety , &quot; said a Metropolitan Police spokesman . 
nearly 30,000 runners are expected to take part and organisers claim almost another million will be roadside spectators .
