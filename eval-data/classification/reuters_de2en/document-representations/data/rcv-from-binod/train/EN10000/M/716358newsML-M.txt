Philippine shares on Wednesday recorded their biggest single-day drop in three months as high interest rates and fears of a peso devaluation sparked selling of near-panic proportions , analysts said . 
the Philippine Stock Exchange composite index plunged more than four percent , losing about 110 points to settle at 2,589.20 , its biggest fall in three months . 
analysts said they expected the market to wallow for the rest of the week . 
&quot; With the overnight borrowing rate at 30 percent , there &apos;s no way the market can move anywhere but down ... This scenario of high interest rates may remain for the time being so I can &apos;t foresee any bounce in the market soon . 
others agreed . 
&quot; The bottom line is the defence of the peso is sending rates higher which is costly for business . 
at the same time , investors are concerned that the Central Bank continues to sell their dollars , &quot; a foreign broker said . 
investors might actually want the peso to weaken as this would eventually allow the authorities to bring down interest rates , he added . 
since Thailand &apos;s de facto devaluation of the baht last week , the Philippine peso has been the target of speculative attacks and the Central Bank has defended it by intervening strongly and by raising its overnight borrowing rate to a two and a half-year high of 30 percent . 
on Wednesday , there was a fresh wave of speculative attacks on the peso after the Singapore Straits Times newspaper said the country &apos;s Monetary Board would discuss its devaluation . 
trade Secretary Cesar Bautista , who was quoted in the article , denied having said that devaluation was being discussed . 
the peso had also been attacked on Monday again in response to an article in the Straits Times and also denied by officials . 
President Fidel Ramos , responding to a question at his weekly news conference on Wednesday , said there was a deliberate attempt by some outsiders to undermine the peso . 
&quot; The unusual behaviour of the exchange rate as well as the obvious attacks on the peso ... indicate that there could be a deliberate effort to undermine the peso from outside sources , &quot; Ramos said . 
&quot; We are also seeing a media disinformation campaign of some kind , &quot; he said . 
stocks analyst said uncertainties over the peso were affecting the stock market . 
&quot; It &apos;s very bad as foreign funds are out of the Philippines and the region because of concerns about the peso , &quot; said Teresa Lee , vice-president at Asiamerit Securities . 
&quot; People do not know what the Central Bank is up to , whether they will continue to defend the peso or not . 
it &apos;s driving the people out of the equities market , &quot; said Jose Ricardo Garcia , executive vice-president at diversified Securities .
