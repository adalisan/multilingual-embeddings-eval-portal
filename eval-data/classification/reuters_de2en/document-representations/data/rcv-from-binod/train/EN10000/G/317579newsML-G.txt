a nagging controversy over how Martin Luther King Jr . &apos; s family profits from his legacy threatened to overshadow the hometown events that mark the observance of the national holiday that honours him Monday . 
less than two weeks ago the King estate signed a publishing deal for the slain civil rights leader &apos;s writings and speeches that may earn the family $ 50 million during the next five years . 
meanwhile , the King Centre is celebrating his birthday with fewer events than at any time since the King holiday was first observed 11 years ago . 
many politicians and dignitaries are passing up this year &apos;s traditional ecumenical service at Ebenezer Baptist Church so they can attend the Washington inauguration of President Clinton , who gave the keynote speech at the church last year . 
since he became president of the King Centre for non-violent Social Change , King &apos;s son , Dexter , has slashed the schedule of events that has traditionally filled the days leading to King &apos;s birthday . 
the teach-ins , tributes , church services and symposia on non-violence and conflict resolution that previously marked King Week are no longer a priority , he said . 
the recent announcement that the King estate was entering into a publishing venture with Time Warner added to the persistent controversy over the King family &apos;s desire to control and profit from King &apos;s legacy as a thinker , dreamer and inspiration for equality . 
the newspaper ended up paying in $ 1,700 for the licensing and $ 10,000 in attorneys &apos; fees and court costs . 
in November 1996 the King estate sued CBS claiming &quot; sustained loss of revenues &quot; because the television network used parts of the speech in a documentary being sold as a home video . 
the King Centre sells an audiocassette of the nine-minute speech in its own gift shop for $ 10 . 
&quot; Intellectual property is what my father created , &quot; Dexter King said . 
&quot; Because my father owned no real property , his intellectual property is especially important as an asset . 
the King family &apos;s joint venture with Time Warner will assemble a posthumous autobiography based on King &apos;s writings , publish books by family members and offer King &apos;s words in new forms of media . 
Phillip Jones , a college friend of Dexter King who began marketing King &apos;s works in 1994 , estimated the deal will bring King &apos;s widow and four children $ 30 million to $ 50 million in the next three to five years . 
some people believe the family &apos;s desire to exploit King &apos;s copyrighted words is incongruous with his last sermon , in which he said he wanted to be remembered for serving others and for not having any money to leave behind after his death . 
&quot; aggressive commercialism starkly contradicts King &apos;s own utter disinterest in using his service to the civil rights movement to benefit himself financially , &quot; said David Garrow , an Emory University law professor whose biography of King won a Pulitzer Prize . 
&quot; The profit motive was never part of his life . 
because King , who was assassinated in 1968 , is a historic figure who is celebrated with a national holiday , critics say his family is being &quot; mean-spirited and ridiculous &quot; by insisting on exclusive ownership of historic thoughts that are in the public domain .
