Dutch giant Philips electronics NV signalled on Friday its clear intent to shed small underperforming businesses , freeing up resources to grow its core activities . 
in a brief statement Philips said its Industrial electronics ( IE ) division would sell nine small operating companies this year , adding to a string of minor sell-offs in recent months . 
&quot; Philips ( IE ) ... announced its intention to further stimulate growth in several of its operating companies , &quot; the group said . 
&quot; This decision , which will allow the division to focus on and strengthen its key businesses , will also lead to nine smaller operating companies being sold . 
it said the companies concerned employ around 1,500 staff and made up around 15 percent of total IE sales , which amounted to over three billion guilders in 1996 . 
the firms to be sold off are : Philips Power Systems of Wavre , Belgium ; Thermocoax of Suresnes , France ; Philips TV Test Equipment of Brondby , Denmark ; Philips weighing and Philips Electronic Center of Hamburg , Germany ; Philips Industrial automation Systems of Eindhoven and PBF of Almelo in the Netherlands ; Philips Kistaindustrier AB of Kista , Sweden and Edax International of Mahwah , New Jersey in the United States . 
Philips &apos; IE division will now focus on several clusters of activities , such as analytical equipment , communication and security products and systems , electronic production equipment and industrial and infrastructure projects , it said . 
the group , which slumped back into a loss in 1996 , said on February 25 it was selling a 50 percent stake in cable television operator United and Philips Communications BV ( UPC ) , a joint-venture with United International Holdings Inc . 
Philips has not yet given a clear indication of what it plans to do with the proceeds of a string of disposals announced or completed since last October when new chairman Cor Boonstra vowed to tackle underperforming elements . 
Philips has embarked on a stringent restructuring to weed out non-core businesses and tighten management as a way of boosting profits , winding up or selling off units such as its Videoland and Superclub home entertainment businesses . 
heavy loss-making German consumer electronics unit Grundig was pushed out to arm &apos;s length in January when Philips said it would no longer pick up the tab for 100 percent of its losses , instead consolidating the firm in proportion to its 32 percent minority shareholding . 
analysts have welcomed the moves as emphasising that Boonstra meant business in sorting out the company &apos;s weak spots and putting Philips back on track towards profit . 
in Amsterdam , Philips shares closed 1.40 guilders higher at 83.50 guilders each .
