India on Friday said it would not block a U.N. General Assembly debate on a nuclear weapons test ban treaty but put the United Nations on notice it would insist on a two-thirds majority vote for any action . 
India &apos;s U.N. ambassador Prakash Shah also told a news conference he would argue that taking a vote was illegal because the Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament had not approved the treaty , as the assembly had asked last year . 
Australia has called a meeting of the 185-member General Assembly for Sept . 9 to have it adopt the draft treaty and open it for signature by individual states . 
after nearly three years of negotiations for a landmark Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , India this month refused to endorse the text by the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament because nuclear weapons states made no move to give up their arsenals . 
that kept the entire treaty in limbo since decisions at the conference have to be unanimous . 
there is a dispute about whether the General Assembly needs a simple majority or a two-thirds vote , but diplomats in favour of the treaty said they expected to get the two-thirds majority in any case . 
India , however , is counting on developing nations , only 29 of which were represented in Geneva , to support its position . 
the treaty cannot go into force until 44 nations with nuclear capabilities sign and ratify it . 
but states like Australia believe the commitment to stop testing would begin as soon as the treaty was open for signature and India would come under pressure to sign it . 
&quot; We are now faced with attempts to circumvent the decision of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva by a procedural manoeuvre , &quot; Shah told reporters . 
&quot; If we all believe that the treaty is such an important issue , Article 18 should apply , &quot; he said , referring to a U.N. Charter article that important questions need a two-thirds majority of members voting . 
Shah said India did not approve the treaty because it did not lead to elimination of nuclear weapons , did not cover all kinds of nuclear testing and allowed the five acknowledged nuclear weapons powers to continue developing and improving the quality of their atomic arms . 
he called the draft a &quot; flawed document &quot; and said it failed to meet the mandate given by the General Assembly as well as the Non-Aligned Movement and therefore could not be considered a first step towards nuclear disarmament . 
Shah also vigorously denied that India opposed the treaty because it did not want to stop its nuclear weapons programme , saying the nuclear powers would not give the slimmest commitment to work towards eliminating these arms . 
Australia &apos;s U.N. ambassador , Richard Butler , earlier said he agreed with many of the criticisms India raised because &quot; it is right to want progress in nuclear disarmament . 
&quot; But he said since 1945 there had been 530 nuclear tests , many in the atmosphere , so states could develop ever more sophisticated arms . 
therefore commitments to stop testing were tantamount to a moratorium on developing new and different nuclear bombs .
