several thousand demonstrators marched through the centre of the Belarussian capital Minsk on Monday to protest against closer ties with Russia . 
large numbers of police and OMON special security men were deployed to preserve order and prevent the protesters marching towards the presidential palace . 
angry scuffles broke out and Interfax news agency said several people were injured . 
the protesters burned a Russian flag and an effigy of hardline President Alexander Lukashenko , a keen advocate of closer relations with Moscow . 
organisers of the demonstration told Reuters they were protesting in particular against the arrival in Minsk of a delegation of Russian deputies to discuss integration between the two former Soviet republics . 
last Friday Lukashenko met Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin and the two leaders agreed to step up their drive for closer union under the terms of a 1996 &quot; community &quot; . 
Moscow &apos;s renewed wooing of Minsk coincides with a diplomatic offensive against NATO &apos;s expansion plans . 
in a joint declaration issued after their talks on Friday , Yeltsin and Lukashenko reiterated their common hostility towards NATO enlargement . 
Monday &apos;s demonstrators carried banners with slogans like &quot; Integration is occupation &quot; and &quot; Belarus will be with Europe , not with Russia &quot; . 
last week Lukashenko , under fire from the West for assuming sweeping powers and rewriting his country &apos;s constitution , ordered limits on political rallies and banned his opponents from using post-independence national symbols , which he has scrapped in favour of old Soviet ones . 
the local authorities had given permission on Monday for no more than 40 people to mount a demonstration .
