the Republican-led Senate Budget Committee , relying on the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office economic forecasts , estimated the current 1997 fiscal year deficit will be near $ 120 billion and will rise to about $ 200 billion in the year 2002 , an aide said . 
the CBO &apos;s projections for the budget deficit , federal spending and tax revenues , are to be formally presented to the panel at a Tuesday hearing and will be very close to the committee &apos;s estimates , the aide said . 
the CBO deficit forecast shows the impact of continuing current programs and policies . 
the Clinton administration is to revise its estimate of the fiscal 1997 deficit in the budget to be released February 6 . 
last week the Treasury Department said the government posted a surprisingly large December surplus of $ 10.4 billion which is expected to improve the year &apos;s picture . 
the last published estimate of the government &apos;s anticipated fiscal 1997 budget deficit was $ 125.7 billion , up from a shortfall of $ 107.28 billion in fiscal 1996 . 
analysts said the fiscal 1997 number could come in around $ 110 billion , just slightly larger than the $ 107 billion posted for fiscal 1996 .
