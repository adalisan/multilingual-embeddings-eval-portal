Ken Griffey Jr drove in two runs as the Seattle mariners completed their first road sweep of the New York Yankees with a 3-2 victory Sunday . 
the mariners had never swept a series of any length at Yankee Stadium since entering the American League in 1977 . 
they have won five straight games overall to climb to 16 games over .500 ( 60-44 ) for the first time in franchise history . 
&quot; It came at a right time for us , &quot; mariners manager Lou Piniella said of the sweep . 
&quot; We &apos;ve got a day off tomorrow . 
we &apos;ll enjoy it a little more . 
Griffey , who ended a long drought by homering in the first two games of the series , stroked a two-run single that completed a three-run third inning against Andy Pettitte ( 12-6 ) . 
Griffey had three hits and is 7-for-14 lifetime against Pettitte , who had a four-game winning streak snapped . 
Jeff Fassero ( 9-6 ) allowed two runs and eight hits in seven-plus innings for his first win in exactly a month . 
Bob Wells worked out of a ninth-inning jam for his second save . 
&quot; I was pitching with a purpose to shut out the middle of the order , &quot; Fassero said . 
&quot; But sometimes you have a tendency to let down when you get to the bottom . 
this sweep shows what a great team we have .
