Central bank governor Dai Xianglong called on Monday for faster reform of China &apos;s financial system and urged expanded use of market levers to control credit . 
&quot; This year we must speed up the use of market mechanisms for controlling the financial markets ... we must actively use the leverage from credit and interest rates , &quot; the Xinhua news agency quoted Dai as saying at the opening of a five-day meeting of Chinese bankers . 
thousands of officials from the central bank and commercial banks around the country had gathered in Beijing to discuss policy issues for the new year . 
major commercial banks would also hold their own internal policy meetings during the week . 
&quot; We must pursue an appropriately tight monetary policy to ensure that inflation this year is lower than last year , &quot; said Dai , head of the People &apos;s Bank of China . 
retail price inflation in 1996 was 6.0 percent , down from 14.48 percent in 1995 and below the economic growth rate of 9.7 percent , official figures show . 
&quot; We have reached our target of controlling inflation after the efforts of the last three years , &quot; said Dai . 
&quot; The financial situation is developing with stability . 
China imposed a credit squeeze in mid-1993 , but last year cut interest rates twice , in May and August , partly to ease the burden of loan payments on lumbering state enterprises . 
China must step up supervision of the financial system and authorities should focus on limiting financial risk , Dai said . 
officials closed down a number of illegal financial institutions and had taken tough measures against firms that had violated financial regulations , he said . 
&quot; As for some trust and investment companies that incurred serious financial risk , the central bank has taken them over , commercial banks have bought them out or new assets have been injected to shore up their finances , &quot; he said . 
the central bank this month placed one of China &apos;s largest investment trusts , stung by real estate losses , under administrative custody . 
the domestic business of China agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp had been taken over by China Construction Bank while its overseas business had become the responsibility of the central Bank of China . 
a major topic of the meeting would be banks &apos; relations with state-owned companies , most of them undergoing restructuring or struggling to survive as China shifts its once centrally planned economy to free market principles , Xinhua said . 
Bank officials would discuss how to continue their drive to lend funds on commercial terms but still help struggling state companies , the news agency said . 
&quot; Over the past few years , local banks have tried hard to help state firms , but with the fear that the banks themselves may be saddled with accumulated bad-loans , &quot; it said . 
China has been trying to reform its ailing state companies , no longer protected by central planning , and make them better able to compete in the sink-or-swim marketplace . 
about 75 percent of its more than 100,000 state firms lost money last year and total losses in the government sector soared to 69 billion yuan ( $ 8.3 billion ) between January and October , a year-on-year rise of 45 percent . 
China has also been trying to make its banking sector extend loans on a commercial basis and move away from past practices of lending based on policy decisions .
