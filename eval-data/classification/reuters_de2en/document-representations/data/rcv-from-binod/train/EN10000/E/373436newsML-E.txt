Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin repeated on Wednesday that a strong U.S. economy will make it possible to balance the budget without the need for a constitutional amendment . 
in prepared testimony for the Senate Finance Committee that echoed his remarks , word for word , submitted on Tuesday to the House Ways and Means Committee , he said the administration &apos;s fiscal 1998 budget proposals were &quot; prudent and realistic , &quot; as was its projection of a balanced budget by 2002 . 
Rubin said a balanced budget amendment was &quot; a threat to our economic health &quot; and urged Congress not to adopt the idea . 
the Treausry chief said progress in reducing deficits since 1993 has made a balanced budget a realistic possibility . 
but he said it should be achieved by Congress and the administration working together to make tough choices about reforming spending , rather than by setting a legally mandated requirement . 
&quot; We are in strong economic shape today and within striking distance of balancing the budget , &quot; Rubin said . 
he added there was strong support among the public for bringing the government &apos;s spending and income into line as well as pressure in global capital markets for the United States to get its spending in order .
