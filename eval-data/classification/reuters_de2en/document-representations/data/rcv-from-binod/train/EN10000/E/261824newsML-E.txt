the Bank of Spain &apos;s 1997 monetary policy report slashed its medium-term inflation goal to two percent , but Bank Governor Luis Angel Rojo warned that the fall in long-term interest rates here may be coming to an end . 
addressing a parliamentary committee on Tuesday , Rojo set out the central bank &apos;s official inflation targets . 
&quot; A medium-term target for monetary policy , ( is to ) place the year-on-year rate of prices growth ... at around two percent in the course of 1998 , &quot; the report said . 
inflation in 1997 was targeted at around 2.5 percent . 
these figures compare with a medium-term inflation target of three percent set this time last year . 
the Spanish government target for 1997 inflation is 2.8 percent . 
the latest inflation data reported inflation at 3.2 percent year-on-year in November , a substantial improvement from 4.3 percent at the end of 1995 . 
despite this much brighter outlook , Rojo warned that the continued fall in bond market yields amid dynamism in Spain &apos;s financial markets might be coming to an end . 
&quot; .. we &apos;ve arrived at a situation where a proportion of reasonable declines ( in long- and medium-term interest rates ) is , to a great extent , over , &quot; Rojo told the committee . 
the central bank would keep its eye on inflation improvements , adjusting monetary policy accordingly and aiming to keep financial markets on a steady course , Rojo said . 
he also warned that falling yields on 10-year bonos would not necessarily be reflected in cuts in the central bank &apos;s key rate . 
&quot; We mustn &apos;t expect that the Bank of Spain &apos;s basic intervention rate moves in strict parallel with longer-term interest rates , nor that ... the reductions in long-term rates should be followed by more or less immediate cuts in the key intervention rate , &quot; he said . 
only last Friday the central bank lopped 50 basis points off its key money market rate , bringing it to 6.25 percent . 
the rate started 1996 at 9.00 percent . 
the move came immediately after the announcement that inflation had fallen to 3.2 percent year on year in November from 3.5 percent in October . 
bond markets today focused on Rojo &apos;s comments that the fall in long-term rates could be reaching its limit , and bono prices slipped in late morning trade . 
&quot; The bono-Bund spread is close to the key 100 basis point level and I think Rojo &apos;s comments will have just encouraged profit-taking . 
also we &apos;ve seen some switching into Italy ahead of an expected rate cut there later this week , &quot; said Mark Geddes , economist at London research company 4Cast Ltd . 
but the central bank &apos;s sharp downwards revision in its inflation target seemed to indicate further rate cuts ahead . 
&quot; These comments are suportive of Spanish easing with a sharp drop in the inflation target , which reflects confidence that the good November figure was not just a one-off , &quot; Geddes added . 
most economists expect cuts in Spain &apos;s key rate of at least 50 basis points in 1997 , stemming from the improved inflation outlook and progress towards European convergence targets .
