peacemaking between Israel and the PLO has has been overtaken by violence and mutual accusations a week after bulldozers began ploughing a hill in Arab East Jerusalem . 
Israeli troops clashed with Palestinians on Tuesday for the sixth consecutive day over construction of a Jewish settlement at Jabel Abu Ghneim ( Har Homa in Hebrew ) launched on March 18 . 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the PLO of directing the violence , while Palestinian officials said the Israeli leader was responsible for the unrest . 
we know there is no such thing , &quot; said Netanyahu . 
&quot; We know that everything is organised and directed and the responsibility for any violence which springs from these demonstrations and any blood that is spilt as a result is on those who encourage and allow this violence , &quot; he told policemen at a citation ceremony . 
in the West Bank towns of Bethlehem and Hebron , Israeli troops wounded dozens of Palestinians with rubber bullets during protests by hundreds of stone-throwers . 
the protest scenes , reminiscent of a six-year Palestinian uprising which ended with the first Israel-PLO peace deal in 1993 , have coincided with warnings by Israeli security officials of more suicide attacks . 
a Palestinian bomber blew himself up at a Tel Aviv cafe on Friday killing three Israeli women . 
&quot; Netanyahu is personally responsible for the violence in West Bank towns and villages as a result of his illegal decisions , &quot; said the head of Palestinian general intelligence Amin al-Hindi . 
&quot; He has created the atmosphere of violence and tension in the area , &quot; he told Reuters . 
Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat have not ruled out a crisis summit but such a meeting appeared far off . 
Arafat , on a visit to the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo , said he was prepared to meet Netanyahu so long as the purpose of their meeting was to discuss peace and not empty publicity . 
&quot; Why not ? 
if this is for peace I am ready , but if it is for propaganda , it is something different , &quot; he told reporters . 
U.S. officials said a peace mission by Middle East negotiator Dennis Ross was under consideration but far from set . 
Netanyahu &apos;s communications chief David Bar-Illan said the prime minister would accept a summit with Arafat so long as the issue of security topped the agenda . 
&quot; We are obviously not rejecting any idea for a meeting but we expect that if such a meeting takes place , it will focus on the issues of security and terrorism , &quot; Bar-Illan told Reuters . 
Palestinians object to any preconditions and say the sides must talk about other issues besides security . 
Palestinians deny charges by Netanyahu that Arafat has given Islamic militants a tacit &quot; green light &quot; to carry out attacks including Friday &apos;s bombing . 
&quot; The Israeli government is looking to having instability and confrontation between the Palestinians , a civil war , which we cannot accept , &quot; Arafat said when asked about Israel &apos;s demand that he clamp down on militant groups . 
Arafat &apos;s Fatah movement , angry at the building of 6,500 homes for Jews in East Jerusalem , called on Palestinians to confront Jewish settlement activity with non-violent protests and by blocking roads used by Jewish settlers in the West Bank . 
&quot; Our objective is to raise our voice to the world against settlement activity . 
but we are not calling for violence , &quot; Fatah spokesman Mahmoud Jasser told Reuters .
