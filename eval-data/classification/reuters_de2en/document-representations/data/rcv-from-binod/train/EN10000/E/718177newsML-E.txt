Indonesia &apos;s central bank governor Sudradjad Djiwandono said on Wednesday a curb on property loans was needed because a policy of moral suasion had not been effective enough . 
the central bank announced on Monday that commercial banks were not allowed to allocate new loans to property developers for land procurement and development , except for construction of low-cost housing . 
&quot; A policy of moral suasion was not effective enough to reduce rapid rises in property loans . 
therefore , on July 7 , we decided to stop loans for land procurement and development , &quot; Djiwandono said . 
economists welcomed the ruling as a good preventive move . 
Djiwandono said , however , more than 90 percent of loans to the property sector were still classified as without problems . 
&quot; compared with total loan collectivity , the state of property loans is still better , &quot; Djiwandono said . 
the governor said a fast increase in property loans could endanger monetary stability and the health of the banking sector because of its sensitivity to economic changes . 
&quot; ... their financing is long-term while banking funds are short-term . 
liquidity and market risks faced by banks providing those loans are relatively high , &quot; Djiwandono said . 
he said property loans as a percentage of total credits rose to 19.61 percent in April 1997 from 12.2 percent in December 1992 , with commercial banks posting the highest growth .
