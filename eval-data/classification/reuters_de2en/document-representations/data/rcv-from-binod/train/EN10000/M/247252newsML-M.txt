basis bids for hard red winter in the central and southern U.S. Plains were mixed Tuesday in quiet dealings , merchandisers said . 
&quot; With the drop in futures yesterday ( Monday ) , I imagine we &apos;ll be quiet this morning , &quot; a Kansas dealer said . 
another Kansas merchandiser noted an increase in farmer selling early Monday , but said that activity dried up as the futures market tumbled . 
he expected slow sales again Tuesday as farmers decided whether to sell before the end of the year . 
&quot; Farmers are asking themselves , do I need the income this year , or should I wait and pay taxes next year , &quot; the merchandiser said . 
however , he said there is growing concern over U.S. tax regulations and deferred payment pricing . 
that concern could spur additional sales this year .
