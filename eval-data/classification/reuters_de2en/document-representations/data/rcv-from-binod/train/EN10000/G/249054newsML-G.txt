President Fernando Henrique Cardoso &apos;s hopes of re-election got a boost on Wednesday when a poll found 60 percent of Brazilians backed his running for a second term , with 36 percent against . 
the survey was published just as the government was seeking to muster majorities in Congress for a constitutional amendment that would allow presidents , state governors and mayors to stand for a second term . 
two polls in October found 51 percent of respondents in favour of letting Cardoso run in the 1998 presidential elections . 
Wednesday &apos;s poll , produced by the private Brazilian Opinion poll Institute ( Ibope ) for the National Industry Confederation ( CNI ) , also gave Cardoso &apos;s government a strong 66 percent approval rating , with 27 percent disapproving , up from 60 and 29 percent respectively in a February poll . 
&quot; Brazilians are growing increasingly satisfied with life . 
this is important as it indicates consistent optimism unlike in the past when public opinion was buffeted by a string of economic plans , &quot; the CNI said in a report accompanying the poll . 
re-election for holders of executive office has been barred since the republic was founded in 1889 in response to Portugal &apos;s authoritarian colonial rule . 
but Cardoso &apos;s administration argues that the government &apos;s two-year-old economic plan , which slashed inflation from an annualized 5,000 percent in 1994 to 10 percent this year , needs the continuity that re-election could provide . 
political analysts say the success of the Real Plan , named after a new currency introduced in 1994 , would make Cardoso a hard candidate to beat if he is able to run in 1998 . 
according to the Ibope / CNI poll , 54 percent of Brazilians believed the plan had improved their lives , with 16 percent saying things had got worse and 30 percent sensing no change . 
seventy-nine percent said 1997 would be a good or very good year . 
the pollsters interviewed 2,000 people across Brazil between Nov . 27 and Dec . 1 . 
no margin of error was given .
