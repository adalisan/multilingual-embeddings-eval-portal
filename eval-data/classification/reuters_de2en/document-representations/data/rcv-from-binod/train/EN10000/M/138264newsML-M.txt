Austrian shares fell 0.65 percent in slow trade on Wednesday , continuing a retracement towards 1,080 points that was triggered by the market &apos;s failure to break above 1,100 at the start of the week . 
the ATX index of 21 blue-chip shares closed 7.12 points down at 1,081.48 despite a rise in earnings at blue-chip firms Mayr-Melnhof and Radex-Heraklith . 
&quot; Not even these positive figures could jolt the market awake , &quot; said a trader . 
most market participants took the decline in their stride , however , arguing that downside was limited . 
&quot; The 1,080 level will certainly hold , &quot; one said . 
AMS was already suffering ahead of the release of its third quarter results next week . 
&quot; Some investors are bailing out ahead of the results , which most people assume will be bad , &quot; said a trader . 
building materials firm Wienerberger and national utility Verbund will release their nine-month profit figures on Thursday and Friday respectively . 
the broad-based Vienna bourse index ended 2.8 points down at 414.79 .
