* Bond market suffers on back of weaker U.S treasuries 
the New Zealand money market rallied into the close on Thursday with solid Asian interest in the front part of the bill curve and a strong Trade-Weighted Index providing underlying support . 
&quot; Those shorter dates were very well bid in the latter part of the afternoon , &quot; said a dealer . 
the 90-day bank bill yield , which fell four points at the open , continued to rally in afternoon trade to end at 7.67 percent , seven points lower than Wednesday &apos;s close . 
dealers saw scope for further falls in short term wholesale interest rates as long as the TWI remained strong , 
&quot; That &apos;s the real key to it . 
it seems to have ignored bond sentiment , so people are still keen to sit on the bid , &quot; said a dealer . 
he said the strength was predominantly in the front of the bill curve , where most of the Asian buying interest was evident . 
&quot; I guess the back part of the bank bill curve is just struggling on a fair-value basis against the futures , which are just washing around inside 92.65-75 , &quot; he said . 
&quot; sentiment too just caps those futures with bonds weaker on the day . 
bond dealers said the long end of the yield curve was weaker on the back of a softer U.S. treasuries market and the mid-dated bonds had suffered indirectly . 
&quot; The pressure is on the long part of the curve to sell but there &apos;s not really too many willing buyers there , so they go looking for other parts of the curve to sell , &quot; a dealer said . 
he said the market was now firmly focused on U.S. payrolls data due out on Friday .
