Thailand &apos;s decision to bite the bullet and seek help from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) was welcomed on Tuesday as a vital move to restore what is most lacking in the economy -- confidence . 
Thailand had been resisting help from the IMF , but with about $ 90 billion in foreign loans and a jittery economy growing at its lowest level in a decade , the government realised it had to act quickly to reassure foreign creditors , analysts said . 
&quot; Thailand just needs the confidence of international investors , &quot; said George Morgan , country manager of ABN AMRO Hoare Govett . 
&quot; It &apos;s very much a confidence-building measure . 
analysts estimate that Thailand needs between $ 10 billion and $ 20 billion to get the economy back on track . 
the government has not yet said if it is actually receiving a loan from the IMF or how much it would seek . 
Thailand has recently taken some tough measures to boost the economy , such as shaking up the ailing finance sector and changing the 13-year-old currency regime that led to a 20 percent de facto devaluation of the baht . 
but analysts said more needed to be done and Thailand could not do it alone . 
they said the country &apos;s dwindling foreign reserves , its rapidly widening balance of payments deficit and looming loan payments had convinced the government to seek advice and a possible standby credit line from the IMF . 
one of the biggest concerns is foreign reserves , which in May dropped to a two-year low of $ 33.3 billion . 
economists say the figure does not accurately reflect the actual amount of reserves and the figure could be as low as $ 20 billion net of forward positions . 
the balance of payments deficit , which widened to about $ 4.3 billion in June from about $ 600 million in May , is adding to the outflow of funds . 
&quot; You &apos;ve also got a lot of capital flight because people don &apos;t have confidence , &quot; said one analyst . 
uncertainty over what level constituted fair value for the baht after its flotation and a hesitation to buy the currency compounded the problems , he added . 
other analysts said Thailand &apos;s penchant for borrowing has also caught up with the economy . 
about $ 40 billion of the country &apos;s foreign loans are short-term , due by the end of the year . 
about $ 10 billion will come due in the next few months . 
analysts said creditors were closely watching financial measures to see if the government was able to make the necessary changes to improve the economy before they decided whether they would roll over loans . 
&quot; If the IMF comes in with offers of standby credit of $ 10-20 billion , the chances of a rollover of those loans will improve , &quot; said Morgan . 
&quot; Foreign bankers are taking a much harder line on rolling over credit , &quot; a foreign analyst said . 
&quot; If confidence does not return and loans are recalled , then reserves could drop to nothing within six months or so . 
if the IMF grants a loan or credit line , it is expected to demand a series of tough measures to narrow the deficit , restore confidence in the economy and stability to the baht . 
&quot; Thailand is really not in a position to negotiate , &quot; said one analyst . 
&quot; It &apos;s going to be very interesting to see how the IMF imposes controls .
