torrential rains brought flash floods to Fort Collins , Colo. overnight , killing four people , sweeping mobile homes into the streets and leaving hundreds homeless , officials said on Tuesday . 
twenty people remained unaccounted for after diving teams rescued people from the flooded waters , some hanging on to poles . 
cars were upturned , mobile homes were floating in bloated creeks and doors were knocked off their hinges in buildings . 
the town , 60 miles ( 100 km ) north of Denver is home to Colorado State University , which suffered extensive damage . 
the American Red Cross in Fort Collins set up two shelters for flood victims . 
some 80 to 90 people showed up at a shelter at the Rocky Mountain High School . 
most of the devastation occurred at a trailer park in Fort Collins where rescue workers went door-to-door , looking for survivors and inspecting damage . 
rescue dogs were brought in and homes considered too unstable to enter were marked in red . 
one train derailed in the flood , officials said . 
Colorado Gov. 
Roy Romer rushed back from a governors &apos; conference in Las Vegas to view the devastation by helicopter . 
&quot; It &apos;s very unusual to have that number of deaths in such a small , concentrated geographic area , &quot; Romer told reporters . 
he said he did not expect the death toll to rise and that no decision had been made yet to seek federal assistance . 
he said state officials would focus on finding emergency housing for flood victims . 
Gail Schoettler looked shaken as she visited the area . 
&quot; My God . 
what nature can do . 
isn &apos;t it incredible ? 
&quot; she said . 
officials were bracing for more rain on Tuesday . 
&quot; There &apos;s a flash flood watch for Fort Collins . 
more thunderstorms are expected , &quot; Frank Denton of the National weather Service said . 
the flash flood watch extended to northeastern Colorado . 
Fort Collins received betweeen four and seven inches of rain on Monday night . 
the area is semi-arid and usually gets about 16 inches of rain a year . 
because the soil in the region is typically dry , it does not absorb rain well , Denton said . 
also , the storm system sat over Fort Collins , rather than moving on . 
Denver received only about one inch of rain on Monday . 
streets and some county roads leading into Fort Collins were closed because of the flooding . 
officials declared a state of emergency during the night and Colorado tourism officials advised travelers to stay out of the area . 
public Service Co. of Colorado , the local utility , said it was called in around 3 a.m. ( 0900 GMT ) to assist in preventing any gas explosions . 
&quot; There were no gas explosions at all , &quot; a spokeswoman for the utility said . 
&quot; Some customers &apos; piping separated from the service line due to the force of the water and there were some small gas ignitions . 
what we did to prevent an explosion from occurring was to shut the gas off in the area . 
at Colorado State University , the Music Department building was hard hit , with marching band uniforms , pianos and sheet music from the 1920s and 1930s destroyed , school officials said . 
classes were cancelled for the day . 
between 20 and 25 buildings suffered major water damage and more than half the library &apos;s 1.7 million books were water-logged , acting CSU President Judd Harper said . 
librarians were hoping they could freeze-dry the books . 
while damage at the university was estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars , school officials said the university had insurance coverage through the state . 
the American Red Cross was asking for donations to be made to the Denver office . 
heavy rains also hit neighbouring New Mexico , causing problems in the desert city of Albuquerque . 
one inch of rain fell in 30 minutes on Monday afternoon , overloading Albuquerque &apos;s drainage system , popping manhole covers and buckling the asphalt on a major city highway .
