Sean Fitzpatrick &apos;s injured knee has improved to the point where he is now a 50-50 chance of leading New Zealand in Saturday &apos;s Bledisloe Cup match against Australia , All Blacks coach John Hart announced on Friday . 
hart said the New Zealand captain successfully completed a private two-hour training session on Thursday night and would face a final fitness test on Saturday morning to determine whether he would play . 
Fitzpatrick aggravated a knee injury during last week &apos;s epic 35-32 victory over South Africa in Johannesburg and was given little hope of playing in Saturday &apos;s match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground when the squad arrived in Australia on Tuesday . 
&quot; He never ceases to amaze me , &quot; Hart told a press conference on Friday . 
&quot; Clearly there is still a bit of a problem but it has improved a lot and I &apos;d say he &apos;s now a 50-50 chance . 
hart said that if Fitzpartick was ruled out , Auckland &apos;s norm Hewitt would come into the team as the new hooker and Zinzan Brooke would take over the captaincy . 
Australia skipper John Eales , meanwhile , defended his team against accusations that they were overawed by the All Blacks . 
Eales said the Wallabies had beaten every other major power in world rugby during the past two seasons but hadn &apos;t been given enough recognition because of their failure to beat New Zealand . 
&quot; The All Blacks are the only team we haven &apos;t beaten since the start of last year and we have to . 
they are the benchmark , &quot; Eales said . 
&quot; I don &apos;t want to come across as though I &apos;m whingeing but we have beaten teams this year that , while they &apos;re not as good as New Zealand , are up on the world stage , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We &apos;re not intimidated by them . 
we &apos;re looking forward to it , and there &apos;s no problems getting the guys up for this game . 
a crowd of 100,000 is expected to attend Saturday &apos;s match which has been billed as one of the most eagerley-awaited Bledisloe Cup fixtures in years .
