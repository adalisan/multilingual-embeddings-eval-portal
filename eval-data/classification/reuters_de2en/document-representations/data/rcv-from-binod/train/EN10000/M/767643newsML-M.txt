Japanese government bonds surged to end Wednesday morning Tokyo trade sharply higher , with the benchmark September 10-year futures contract renewing a three-month high , traders said . 
good buying of cash bonds was seen across the board , but particularly 20-year cash bonds , helped give futures strength . 
rumours that Japan June industrial production , due out at 0430 GMT , may fall by 4.0 percent sparked active buying , with several large-lot orders near 126.00 helping to spur September higher and setting off stop-loss buying . 
September ended the morning at 126.07 against 125.72 at Tuesday &apos;s close . 
September briefly rose as high as 126.17 , its highest level since April 25 , and traders said the fact that the contract had decisively broken above recent resistance near 126.02 suggested further rises may lie ahead , particularly if industrial production falls sharply . 
economists &apos; predictions for June industrial output ranged from a fall of 1.2 percent to a fall of 4.0 percent , compared with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry &apos;s ( MITI ) forecast of a 2.6 percent drop in manufacturers &apos; output . 
one city bank trader said September could rise as far as 126.50 on technical factors if 126.20 resistance is breached . 
good buying of cash bonds across the board , particularly the 20-year cash bond , was detected , giving futures additional strength . 
although institutional investors , perhaps large city banks , were said to be buying the 20-year bond , investor activity elsewhere appeared to be limited , traders said . 
yield on the benchmark 182nd 10-year cash bond stood at 2.145 percent by 0219 GMT against 2.190 percent at Tuesday &apos;s close , the lowest since April 25 . 
light spillover buying resulted from gains in euroyen futures , with the key three-month March euroyen contract at 99.13 by late morning after earlier touching 99.14 . 
little direct impact was expected from the announcement by Tokyo prosecutors that they are investigating Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd in connection with the ongoing racketeer scandal , although traders did say this might provide some peripheral support should stocks fall as a result . 
the market is waiting for the Ministry of Finance &apos;s announcement of penalties for Nomura Securities and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank , expected after the stock and bond markets close at 0600 GMT . 
but little immediate impact is expected from this either , traders added .
