rebels ordered about 30 foreign journalists out of the rebel-held eastern Zairean city of Goma and into western Rwanda late on Sunday , citing security concerns . 
journalists said were told to leave by a rebel commander , who gave his name as Commandant Joseph and said they would be allowed to return to eastern Zaire on Monday when aid assessment teams were due to cross the border into the cities of Goma and Bukavu . 
some other foreign journalists however were allowed to stay in Goma overnight . 
the rebels , who seized Goma more than a week ago , are unable to move west because of firing , at times into the city centre , and battles with former Rwandan troops and militiamen around Mugunga camp . 
Mugunga , which was the largest refugee camp in the world with some 400,000 refugees shortly before the fall of Goma , is believed to still have large numbers of Rwandan Hutu refugees .
