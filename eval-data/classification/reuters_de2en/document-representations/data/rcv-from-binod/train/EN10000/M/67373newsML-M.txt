the Sri Lankan rupee closed on Friday at a record closing low of 56.45 to the dolar on import covering , dealers said . 
the rupee reached an all-time low 56.55 but ended off the low in late dollar profit-taking . 
this compared with Thursday &apos;s close of 56.40 , the previous closing high . 
the rupee &apos;s fall on Friday was also aided by outward remittances by multinational companies , tight liquidity on the money market and speculation the Central Bank would let the rupee fall further , dealers said . 
&quot; There was import covering and speculation got on top of it to drive the rupee very low , &quot; said a Seylan Bank dealer . 
the overnight call money rate ended at 18 percent after rising to 18.5 when a state borrower entered the market , dealers said . 
it closed at 16.5 percent on Thursday . 
dealers expect the rupee to move between 56.35 and 56.50 against the dollar next week .
