prominent opposition deputies launched slashing attacks on Lebanon &apos;s billionaire Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri on Monday as parliament began debating his new government &apos;s policy statement . 
in a rare gesture of defiance from the 128-member house that is dominated by supporters of the pro-Syrian government , leftist Zaher el-Khateeb tore up the statement . 
&quot; This statement is unworthy of anything except tearing up in pieces and here I am tearing it up in front of you , &quot; he told parliament . 
outside , 150 people protested against a government decision to close scores of private radio and television stations by November 30 and issue broadcasting licences to only a handful of stations mostly owned by Hariri and establishment figures . 
&quot; No nation without freedom of expression , &quot; said a banner carried by a demonstrator . 
under the government &apos;s action all stations opposed to the government will be closed . 
opposition groups and trade unions have called a general strike and demonstration on Thursday to protest against the media law , a ban on demonstrations imposed by Hariri three years ago and his perceived lack of social policies . 
the policy statement sets social policies as a priority , emphasising housing , medicare , social security and transportation as well as agriculture , industry and tourism . 
Parliament will hold a vote of confidence on the government on Wednesday after a three-day debate on the proposals . 
Christian deputy Nasib Lahoud , a former ambassador in Washington , said he would vote against the government . 
he called its statement a series of headlines devoid of practical measures to stop corruption and improve the social situation . 
the way the audiovisual media law was being implemented was &quot; a despicable example of the ability of officials to turn a modern , trailblazing law in the Arab world into just a cover to carve up the spoils , &quot; Lahoud added . 
parliamentary newcomer Issam fares , like Hariri a billionaire tycoon and not considered an opponent of the government , also called the government proposals fragmentary and said Lebanon needed a real economic plan . 
fares said the monetary stability Hariri had brought Lebanon was artificial and had raised a danger of stagnation without improving growth or living standards . 
former prime minister Selim al-Hoss said corruption was &quot; settled &quot; in the administration and politics . 
he cited a Reuters report during the parliamentary elections in which a reporter saw Hariri supporters paying people 100,000 Lebanese pounds ( $ 64 ) to vote for him . 
when speaking of corruption &quot; we put the basic blame on the ruling troika ( President Elias Hrawi , parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and Hariri ) ... and more specifically on the government , &quot; Hoss said . 
he called the media law a flagrant case of conflict of interest . 
&quot; If anything similar happened in any of the world &apos;s democracies the earth would have shaken under the feet of the government and the responsible officials , &quot; Hoss said . 
Khateeb , lashing out at Hariri , accused him of ruling with &quot; a condescending logic similar to that of sultans , princes and Sheikhs &quot; while Lebanon underwent social crisis , corruption , bribery and embezzlement . 
&quot; It is the policy of the individual who breaches the constitution and threatens national unity . 
this is the most outstanding characteristic of the prime minister &apos;s pattern of government , &quot; Khateeb said .
