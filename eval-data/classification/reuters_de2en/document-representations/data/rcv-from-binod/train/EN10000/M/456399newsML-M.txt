NYMEX crude ended higher Thursday as traders squared positions ahead of the expiry in the April crude contract at session &apos;s end . 
&quot; The story was refiners rolling their short positions into May out of April , &quot; said Dimon Oil vice president herb Harris , noting commercial players covered short positions in April and established new ones in May , the next spot contract starting Friday . 
April crude ended 28 cents a barrel higher at $ 22.32 .

April gasoline settled off 0.38 cent a gallon at 67.58 cents while April heating oil ended off 0.35 cent at 55.94 cents a gallon . 
traders said there was little talk of possible refined product shipment delays due to sections of the Mississippi River being closed to traffic . 
the mouth of the river was closed after a freighter was grounded there and the area of the river between New Orleans and baton Rouge was closed after 100 barges broke lose there . 
at least one major refiner , Exxon Corp , said operations at its plant at baton Rouge were running &quot; normally .
