Brazil posted a $ 2.031 billion trade deficit in the first two months of the year , within expectations but also in stark contrast to the $ 13 million surplus the country enjoyed in January-February 1996 . 
Jose Roberto Mendonca de Barros , economic policy secretary at the Finance Ministry , said the government sees the trade outlook improving over the coming months when an expected record agricultural harvest starts hitting the docks . 
but he cautioned that Brasilia has not yet made a decision on whether it should stem demand for imports and thus plug Brazil &apos;s burgeoning current account deficit -- widely expected to reach $ 30 billion this year . 
&quot; We are still evaluating ( the data on the economy ) and have taken no decisions , &quot; Mendonca de Barros said . 
&quot; We are watching ( the economy ) with great attention . 
we will keep open the possibility , and that is our natural right , to make changes to our course if needed . 
the trade deficit for January-February this year , based on exports of $ 6.831 billion and imports of $ 8.862 billion , held few surprises for economists , who over the last three months have learned to expect the worst . 
&quot; Nobody was caught by surprise but we cannot say this is a comfortable figure . 
we are talking about a $ 1.0 billion deficit a month , &quot; said Thomas Malaga , chief economist at private bank Unibanco . 
Brazil posted a trade deficit of $ 5.54 billion for the whole of 1996 and a current account gap of $ 24 billion . 
like other analysts , Malaga believes Brazil &apos;s trade picture might start showing signs of improvement in May , as agricultural exports pick up . 
Mendonca de Barros , the economic policy secretary , pointed to the Agriculture Ministry &apos;s latest forecast of an 81 million tonne 1996 / 97 grains and oilseeds crop , a new record and up from its latest estimate of a 78 million tonne harvest . 
he said shipments appear to be starting early this year and this could bode well for the coming months . 
&quot; The agricultural prospects , starting in March , are as good as they can be . 
the increase in the crop is very high and there has also been a good improvement in international prices , &quot; Mendonca de Barros said . 
Mendonca de Barros said that exports were &quot; traditionally weak &quot; at the beginning of the year and that imports of raw materials and capital goods were the result of an investment boom by Brazilian industry . 
and the economic policy secretary said he was unconcerned about how the current account gap was going to be financed , because inflows of foreign direct investment were continuing at record high levels . 
in the first week of March , foreign direct investment was $ 300 million . 
that was the same as in the whole month of February , traditionally slow because of the carnival holiday . 
in January , foreign investment was $ 800 million .
