Vietnam said on Monday it notched up a record trade deficit of $ 3.25 billion in the first eight months of this year as the fast-developing economy sucked in imports at a faster rate than exports . 
the official Vietnam News Agency ( VNA ) said imports rose by 45 percent from the same period of 1995 to $ 7.60 billion , while exports were just 22.6 percent higher at $ 4.35 billion . 
the trade gap was about 5.8 times higher than the cumulative deficit of $ 554 million reported for January-August last year . 
VNA quoted government officials and exporters as saying the trade deficit for the full year was unlikely to be lower than $ 2.50 billion . 
bankers and economists said the Communist government was urgently seeking ways to create a value-added export regime and find funds to bridge a ballooning balance of payments gap . 
&quot; We need to explore the deficiency and in the long term how Vietnam could ... solve the problem of the balance of payments , &quot; said Le Dang Doanh , president of the Vietnam Central Institute for Economic Management . 
Doanh said it was inevitable that a country like Vietnam -- whose economy has taken off since capitalist-style reforms were introduced a decade ago -- should run a trade deficit . 
he pointed out that consumer goods accounted for less than 10 percent of total imports and that most of the country &apos;s imports were capital goods that would ultimately contribute to exports or a drive for import substitution . 
nevertheless , he said investment in manufacturing industry was needed because a country could sustain a balance of payments deficit only if it had a strong export base . 
at present , Vietnam &apos;s main exports are low-value goods such as raw materials , crude oil and rice . 
only 20 percent come from manufacturing . 
earlier this year Hanoi reached a framework agreement on the restructuring of its approximately $ 1.0 billion debt to foreign commercial creditors . 
but foreign bankers say approval by the creditors is unlikely to come before the end of this year . 
without their approval , Hanoi &apos;s plans to make its debut in the international bond market -- where it hopes to raise at least $ 100 million -- will have to remain on hold . 
the country &apos;s annual debt service bill , around $ 270 million a year , leaves little to fill yawning financial gaps at home such as bad loans in the largely state-owned banking system . 
one Western banker said the central State Bank of Vietnam could engineer a &quot; subtle devaluation &quot; of the Dong , the local currency , from around 11,020 per dollar now to 11,150 in coming months to boost exports and trim the import bill . 
he said the government , proud of cutting annual inflation to around three percent this year , would be reluctant to risk upsetting confidence in the economy by sanctioning a more dramatic devaluation . 
&quot; When they see a balance of payments problem looming , they &apos;ll go for a centrally planned solution , &quot; the banker said , adding that the government could opt for stricter import quotas and tariffs .
