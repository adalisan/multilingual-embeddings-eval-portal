China &apos;s experiment with village elections will carry democracy to higher levels of government but reforms will be gradual , a senior civil affairs official said on Thursday . 
grassroots reforms launched in the mid-1980s allowing free , multi-candidate polls had spread to nearly a million villages across China , said Wang Zhenyao , deputy director of the office of basic-level democracy under the Ministry of Civil Affairs . 
&quot; China will develop its democracy , &quot; Wang told a news briefing . 
&quot; But our experiences conclude that promotion of democratic elections should not be too fast . 
China &apos;s Communist Party still holds a firm grip on power and it is far from considering any sharing of political control . 
but at the village level it has been willing to experiment with real elections and reformers within the party would like to see that trend advance . 
market-oriented policies launched in 1978 by late leader Deng Xiaoping had laid the groundwork for democratic elections by allowing people to pursue their own interests , Wang said . 
the ministry was looking into ways to push democratic reform to the county , provincial and even national levels but technical problems meant a lengthy waiting period , said Wang . 
the official quoted Deng as saying in the late 1980s that reforms could take 50 years to reach the national level . 
Wang gave no new timeframe for democratic elections at the most senior level of government but it was clear that multi-candidate polls were still far off . 
educating China &apos;s hundreds of millions of potential voters on election and campaign procedures , monitoring for poll fraud and ensuring smooth transfers of power were just some of the problems facing expansion of elections , he said . 
&quot; There are indeed some people who try to manipulate rural elections in China , and some cases are rather serious , &quot; he said . 
another problem was getting people to follow simple rules of order , he said . 
&quot; How to get the farmers to queue up ? 
we know how difficult it is to get city dwellers to queue up , what about farmers ? 
&quot; he asked . 
&quot; The technical difficulties involved in holding elections even at the county level mean it is still too early and we need to wait a bit longer , &quot; he said . 
Western analysts have speculated that China &apos;s rapid economic development and rising incomes would push democratic reform as individuals demand a greater say in the political system . 
but more money in people &apos;s pockets did not neccessarily mean democratic reform , Wang said , adding that wealthy coastal Fujian province and the impoverished northern province of Gansu had been equally successful in holding elections . 
Wang said grassroots democracy was crucial to peacefully settling local disputes between competing or rival villages and would lessen the need for higher-level intervention . 
&quot; If people enjoy more rights of participation in political , social and economic affairs , they will find their own ways to settle or avoid disputes , &quot; he said .
