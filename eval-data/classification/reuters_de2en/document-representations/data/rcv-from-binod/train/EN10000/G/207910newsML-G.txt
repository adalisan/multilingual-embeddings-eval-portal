French Senate President Rene Monory said on Thursday a cabinet reshuffle might be useful at this point but added that Prime Minister Alain Juppe should keep his job despite a plunge in popularity . 
Monory , interviewed by Europe 1 radio , said he was not aware of any imminent reshuffle of the centre-right government . 
Monory , a member of the centrist UDF party which is the junior partner in France &apos;s ruling coalition , said shuffling ministers might be a useful move to break France out of a mood of pessimism . 
&quot; Why not , &quot; he said when asked whether a reshuffle was advisable . 
&quot; Maybe the time as come , maybe it &apos;s the move that should be taken but I don &apos;t think it &apos;s the prime minister that will make a difference . 
it might be more like a reshuffle to change a bit , you know the French need that from time to time , &quot; he added . 
&quot; I am not at all in favour of overhauling everything but there is talk of it . 
that &apos;s all . 
Juppe , whose popularity has tumbled because of record unemployment of 12.6 percent and budget austerity to help France qualify for a single European currency from 1999 , has faced widening criticism of his rule . 
Monory said he believed changing prime ministers would not be useful because whoever headed the government would be unpopular due to France &apos;s austerity policies . 
&quot; I have always said that whoever was prime minister would be unpopular , &quot; he said . 
on Wednesday , a source at President Jacques Chirac &apos;s office said that rumours of an imminent change had no foundation . 
&quot; If there is a reshuffle , it would probably be at the start of 1997 , &quot; the source said .
