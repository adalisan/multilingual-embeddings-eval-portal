prospects for a recovery in lead prices have risen and the market is expected to strengthen toward the end of the current quarter to target resistance above $ 700 , metal trader Rudolf Wolff said . 
in a special report Wolff said that the prospects for recovery depend on the battery season and the weather during this summer and the coming winter . 
&quot; However , with total commercial stocks below the comfortable five weeks level and falling Chinese exports the oversold lead market looks set for a recovery , &quot; Wolff analyst Martin Squires said . 
global economic expansion , particularly in the developing world , is expected to boost lead demand over the next six to 12 months . 
production is also rising , and should absorb most of this demand . 
but due to mine closures last year and the decreasing availabity of scrap batteries the overall rise in primary and secondary production will be less than previously forecast , Wolff said . 
this is likely to attract increased consumer interest in coming months ahead of battery season , although consumers may be wary of taking coverage too soon . 
but the trigger of a change in consumer buying patterns could come from the speculative side of the market , as investment funds cover their short positions to take profits . 
this may already be happening , as last Friday saw lead prices rise to three month highs . 
Chinese exports are also seen lower this year , compared to 1996 , when there was a surge in the latter half of the year . 
&quot; However , as the months rolled on it has become apparent that this was a one-off increase to take advantage of the high lead price in excess of $ 800 , &quot; Wolff said . 
even if the lead price recovers , Chinese exports are unlikely to return to the levels seen last year , with China &apos;s industry already operating at full capacity and domestic demand rising .
