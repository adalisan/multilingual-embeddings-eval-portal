China &apos;s two B share markets soared on Monday , with the Shanghai index hitting a three-year high thanks to an inflow of domestic investors targetting so-called &quot; rubbish stocks &quot; , brokers said . 
Shanghai &apos;s B share index surged 8.641 points or 12.96 percent to end at a 1996 closing high of 75.331 points , with volume of 91.3 million shares , the biggest this year , worth just under $ 34 million . 
&quot; Most of the buyers today in Shanghai were domestic investors targetting &apos; rubbish stocks &apos; , &quot; said one Chinese broker , referring to low-priced , unpopular share issues . 
&quot; This is the same strategy they have used in the A share market , targetting good-quality stocks first and then the poor ones , which foreign investors will not buy , &quot; he added . 
Shanghai Lianhua Fibre , a poorly-regarded firm which makes yarn and polyester , was the star on bargain-hunting , surging $ 0.074 or 44.04 percent to $ 0.242 , on volume of 3.6 million shares . 
a second Chinese broker said it was clear the regulators had given up attempts to enforce a ban on mainland Chinese buying foreign currency B shares which are legally reserved for investors outside China . 
&quot; The regulators have published the ban but not produced specific regulations to enforce it , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Another bullish factor was rumours that the government will announce measures to boost the market and pick better-quality firms for listing . 
in Shenzhen , the market was also dominated by Chinese investors attracted by its recent rises , brokers said . 
trading has become increasingly speculative and will become more volatile in the coming sessions , they said . 
&quot; The market &apos;s sharp gains over the past month have been attracting more and more investors , especially mainland Chinese , &quot; said a broker at China Southern Securities . 
&quot; Securities regulators may act to cool the excessively bullish sentiment , by such measures as tightening controls on buying by domestic investors , &quot; he said .
