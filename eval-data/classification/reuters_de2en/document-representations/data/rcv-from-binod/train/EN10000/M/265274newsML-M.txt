U.S. West Coast light crudes stayed flat during a quiet Tuesday session , as traders awaited Canadian crude offers due late this week . 
&quot; I think we &apos;ll see some more barrels emerge , &quot; a West Coast dealer said . 
spot cargoes of Alaska North Slope ( ANS ) were still talked $ 1.70 a barrel under WTI following the sale of a cargo Friday . 
absolute ANS prices were flat from Monday at $ 23.90 / 24.10 with some traders already gone for the holiday season . 
line 63 continued to trade very thinly , with no fixed basis deals and posted plus values set at $ 0.95 to $ 1.05 . 
Kern River outright prices kept at $ 18.15 / 18.25 a barrel late after rising the day before on increases in posted prices . 
discounts remained 10 cents below to even with postings , traders said . 
Wilmington crude , produced offshore in Long Beach , Calif . , also rose with postings Monday to $ 19.65 / 19.75 .
