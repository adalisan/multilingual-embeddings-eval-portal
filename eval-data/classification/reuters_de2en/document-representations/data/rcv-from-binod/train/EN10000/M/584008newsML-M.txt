the Belgian franc appeared to have put an end on Wednesday to its recent slide which pushed the currency to well above its 20.6255 ERM midpoint , dealers said . 
&quot; There is a consensus that 20.64 is not so bad after all and since everything is quiet on the political front , it should soon return to its midpoint , &quot; one trader said . 
at 1405 GMT , the franc was at 20.6395 / 00 to the mark against 20.6410 / 20 late on Tuesday . 
dealers said the franc had not affected short-term rates . 
&quot; So bonds certainly stayed out of trouble , &quot; one said . 
OLOs built further on early gains in line with Bunds with the 10-year OLO yielding 5.78 percent against 5.81 percent in early business and 5.83 percent at the close on Tuesday . 
the OLO / Bund yield premium was at 10 basis points against 11 on Tuesday . 
dealers noted some trading in OLOs 26 ( 2007 ) and 14 ( 2004 ) and a flurry of buying interest in the short end in OLOs 11 , 13 and 21 ( maturing in 1998 , 1999 and 2000 respectively ) . 
but they noted that overall business remained slack and feared that once again , key U.S. data due later this week would fail to revive spirits and trade . 
&quot; It looks though that there will be nothing new under the sun , it &apos;s been like this for the past two months now , &quot; one trader said .
