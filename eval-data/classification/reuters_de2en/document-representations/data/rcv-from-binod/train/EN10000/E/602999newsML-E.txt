Denmark &apos;s independent Economic Council on Wednesday urged fiscal tightening to prevent economic overheating , as it upgraded forecasts for the current account , public sector budget and unemployment for 1997 and 1998 . 
the three-member council , known as the Wise Men , left estimates for growth and inflation largely unchanged in its biannual report on the Danish economy . 
it said the overall outlook was positive , but echoed recent central bank warnings about the danger of economic overheating . 
&quot; The current economic situation demands a fiscal tightening in 1998 ... In the attached economic survey it is assumed that that there will be tightening of an extra four billion crowns ( $ 626 million ) , &quot; a commentary to the report said . 
&quot; If there is no such tightening there will be a risk of bottlenecks and a worsening of the balance of payments , &quot; it added . 
finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft has said that he plans 1998 tightening around the current level of 0.5 percent of GDP , equal to some five billion crowns . 
in a section on the likely effects of European economic and monetary union ( EMU ) , the Wise Men saw arguments both for joining and for non-membership . 
&quot; If there is a strong probability that monetary union is going to be stable and the risk of it sparking an economic shock which would specifically damage the Danish economy is deemed to be minimal , Denmark should not hesitate to join EMU from the start , &quot; they wrote . 
Denmark , which is already in Europe &apos;s exchange rate mechanism ( ERM ) , satisfies EMU convergence criteria but its citizens voted in a binding 1993 referendum to stay out . 
the council said that a benefit to Denmark of shunning EMU was that it would remain in control of its own currency . 
&quot; An advantage to non-participation could be that Denmark would have the possibility of single-handedly adjusting its currency if hit by a major domestic upheaval , &quot; it said . 
the Wise Men expected a 1997 current account surplus of 16.1 billion crowns , falling to 11.8 billion in 1998 and rising again to 13.9 billion in 1999 . 
the previous outlook , published last November , saw a 1997 surplus of 6.3 billion crowns , falling to 0.1 billion next year . 
the November survey made no forecasts for 1999 . 
they reversed their outlook on the public sector budget , seeing a 5.3 billion crown surplus in 1997 after predicting a 4.1 billion deficit in their previous report . 
the council saw the budget with a 1998 surplus of 6.8 billion crowns compared with their November forecast of a 4.2 billion-crown deficit . 
the new survey added a 1999 forecast of a sturdy 12.8 billion-crown surplus . 
it said that the stonger public finances were largely due to lower public spending and higher than expected corporate taxes . 
the report said that unemployment would average 219,000 in 1997 , 216,000 in 1998 and 209,000 in 1999 . 
the November overview had foreseen the opposite trend , with a 1997 jobless toll of 236,000 rising to 245,000 the next year . 
latest growth forecasts were unchanged from November , with gross domestic product expected to rise by 2.9 percent in 1997 and 2.2 percent in 1998 . 
the new study added a 1999 forecast of 2.5 percent growth . 
the council said that growth would come from exports and increased personal consumption , fed by rising property values . 
on inflation , calculated by the Danish domestic formula rather than the European Union rationalised method , the new outlook saw consumer prices rising by 2.6 percent in 1997 and 1998 and by 1.9 percent in 1999 . 
the November survey had likewise seen 1997 CPI up 2.6 percent but forecast a 2.7 percent rise in 1998 . 
the report had little effect on financial markets , dealers said , ascribing rises in the benchmark bond price and the KFX top-20 share index to better than expected April inflation data .
