Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will try to end a political quarrel which has shaken Israel &apos;s government by holding talks with Foreign Minister David Levy on Wednesday . 
the prime minister &apos;s office said the two men would meet at 12 : 30 p.m. ( 0930 GMT ) . 
it will be their first confrontation since the disgruntled foreign minister threatened on Monday to quit over the way the government was run . 
levy , a political veteran , accused Netanyahu of keeping him in the dark on important issues including political appointments and Middle East peace moves . 
analysts predicted the government would survive the crisis , which underscored growing disenchantment with the prime minister and with a three-and-a-half-month-old impasse in peacemaking because of Jewish settlement construction . 
Netanyahu , clearly hoping to placate Levy , told reporters on Tuesday : &quot; I believe the most natural thing from my standpoint is that the foreign minister guide the daily work between us and the Palestinians . 
I believe a way will be found also to implement this . 
levy &apos;s threat to resign was triggered by a media disclosure last week that National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon secretly met top Palestinian official Mahmoud Abbas . 
levy said he would have supported the meeting but complained that he had not been informed about it . 
Sharon ruled out a meeting with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on the heels of his talks with Abbas , the Palestinian negotiatior of the 1993 peace accord with Israel . 
levy has said his Gesher faction , with five of the 66 coalition seats in the 120-member parliament , is disappointed by Netanyahu &apos;s failure to advance peace moves or to improve life for low-income Israelis . 
if Levy took Gesher out of the government , Netanyahu &apos;s fate would depend on an unstable parliamentary majority of one built on rebellious Likud members who are also threatening to bolt . 
two ministers have already left the cabinet . 
Netanyahu had hoped to get parliamentary approval on Monday for Sharon to replace one of them , Dan Meridor , as finance minister .
