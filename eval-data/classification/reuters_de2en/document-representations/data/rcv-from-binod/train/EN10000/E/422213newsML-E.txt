financial markets expect a tough statement from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand when it releases its economic projections next week , economists said on Wednesday . 
surprisingly strong economic data and added fiscal stimulus now suggest the Reserve Bank was overly optimistic when it presented its inflation outlook in December &apos;s monetary policy statement . 
the MPS projected a rapid decline in inflation over 1997 and a continued trend lower until March 1999 . 
underlying inflation was 2.4 percent in the year to December 1996 . 
the economic projections , due on March 13 , will be the first to incorporate the National-New Zealand First coalition government &apos;s plans to spend an extra NZ $ 5 billion over the next three years . 
economists said the RBNZ would raise the forecast inflation track and urge markets to maintain current tight monetary conditions . 
&quot; Most definitely a hold-the-line statement , &quot; said Garlick and Co economist Matthew Goodson . 
the economists said any hope of an easing in conditions in 1997 had gone out the window , and in fact some now see a further tightening by mid-1997 . 
Goodson said the crunch question for the RBNZ would be how to incorporate in its projections the government &apos;s extra planned spending over the next three years . 
the answer hinges on results of a referendum , scheduled for September , on whether to adopt a compulsory superannuation scheme requiring people to pay a portion of income into individual pension plans . 
the new coalition government has already postponed until 1998 NZ $ 1.1 billion worth of tax cuts that were due to take place this year . 
if the public votes in favour of compulsory pensions in the referendum , the tax cuts will be scrapped and that money used as the first contribution to the super fund . 
&quot; The problem with ( forecasting ) 18 months out is do you have tax cuts or don &apos;t you ? ... The bank can &apos;t know until after September how they &apos;ll have to set things , &quot; Goodson said . 
Westpac economist Bevan Graham agreed . 
&quot; The Reserve Bank is forced to speculate on the likelihood of tax cuts , not just the impact of the cuts , &quot; he said . 
Westpac is assuming the tax cuts will go ahead . 
Graham said recent economic data gave the bank reason to be cautious next week . 
housing activity was not falling as the RBNZ had expected , unit labour costs had plateaued but were showing no signs of reducing significantly , and import prices did not seem to be falling away as fast as the RBNZ may have expected given the strength of the currency . 
first NZ Capital economist Jason Wong said a 10 percent rise in the minimum wage and the possibility of a further hike next year were also of concern . 
Bancorp Treasury Services economist Roger Kerr said while the RBNZ would probably lift its 1997 forecasts , this could not be interpreted as a harder line on monetary conditions . 
&quot; They will still be forecasting underlying inflation to be at or under the 1.5 percent mid-point ( of the bank &apos;s 0-3 percent target band ) in nine to 12 months time , &quot; he said . 
however , Westpac sees underlying inflation troughing at 1.8 percent at the end of 1997 , before gradually rising back over 2.0 percent . 
&quot; With inflation expectations which look like remaining over two percent , we do not expect underlying inflation longer term to be at the middle of the band , 1.5 percent , &quot; Graham said . 
Westpac doubts the RBNZ will require tighter conditions at this stage , but has brought forward its expectations for the timing of a tightening , to mid-1997 from the end of the year .
