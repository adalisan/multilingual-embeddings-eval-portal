the final phase in selecting a jury to try the wrongful death civil lawsuit against O.J. 
Simpson began on Tuesday with the former football star in attendance , closely following the proceedings . 
Simpson , who was found not guilty last October of the June 12 , 1994 , murders of his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend , Ronald Goldman , avoided making eye contact with any of the 50 potential jurors who were ushered into the courtroom of Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki . 
he watched quietly as jurors were questioned by attorneys , donning glasses during breaks to read newspaper sports pages or transcripts of depositions . 
the Football Hall of Famer is being sued by the families of the victims seeking financial compensation from him for the loss of their loved ones . 
of the 50 potential jurors present on Tuesday , 12 were chosen at random to sit in the jury box to be questioned by attorneys from both sides . 
after a long meeting with the lawyers in his chambers , Fujisaki dismissed two of the 12 , a white woman who appeared to be in her 30s and a black woman in her late 20s or early 30s . 
both had indicated in their jury questionnaires that they had issues to discuss with the judge in private . 
the total number of potential jurors left is 100 of the original pool of more than 200 . 
apart from the two women excused on Tuesday , the others were let go for hardship reasons or because they had formed firm opinions from following the nine-month criminal trial last year . 
of the 100 , 12 will be chosen for the final panel and eight will be picked to serve as alternate jurors . 
the final phase was expected to last for more than a week . 
the first group chosen for questioning on Tuesday consisted of five whites , five blacks and two Latinos . 
also present were Fred and Kim Goldman , the father and sister of Ronald Goldman , who sat in the front row of the public gallery . 
at one point Kim Goldman stared intently at Simpson , who was sitting with his lawyers . 
the first three people to be questioned , a Latino man who works for the U.S. 
postal Service , a black woman who was formerly a court clerk and a white woman who works as an airline stewardess , were questioned closely on the issues of race , whether Simpson &apos;s celebrity status would influence them and whether pressure from friends and family to reach a certain verdict might sway them . 
the racial issue has dominated the jury selection process . 
Simpson is black and the victims were white . 
prosecutors in the criminal case accused Simpson &apos;s defence team of playing &quot; the race card &quot; to appeal to the mainly black jury . 
the former court clerk told Daniel Petrocelli , who represents the Goldman family , that black people viewed racial issues differently from white people , saying &quot; You know &quot; at one point and then adding , &quot; No , you don &apos;t . 
&quot; Petrocelli is white .
