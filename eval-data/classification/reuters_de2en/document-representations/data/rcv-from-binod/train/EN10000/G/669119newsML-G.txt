Jeff &quot; Squeeky &quot; Medlen , the longtime friend and former caddie of PGA Tour star Nick Price , died Monday night after a long battle with leukaemia at the age of 43 . 
Medlen , who had been Price &apos;s caddie for six years , was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukaemia last summer and had been undergoing treatment at a Cleveland hospital . 
in recent months , he underwent two bone marrow transplants . 
&quot; Squeek was more than a friend to me , he was part of my family , &quot; said Price , who dedicated his April victory at the MCI classic to Medlen . 
&quot; He was a huge part of my success , and I will always be grateful for his loyalty and devotion . 
Medlen , nicknamed &quot; Squeeky &quot; because of his high-pitched voice , served as Price &apos;s caddy for 13 of his 14 PGA Tour victories , including triumphs at the PGA Championship in 1992 and 1994 and the British Open in 1994 . 
&quot; I will forever cherish the time , the triumphs and the laughs we shared , &quot; added Price . 
&quot; Golf has lost one of its most colourful characters . 
his personality and sense of humour made him many friends around the world . 
we are all going to miss him dearly . 
Medlen also caddied for John Daly when he won the 1991 PGA Championship . 
&quot; Squeeky was a young man who was loved and respected by everyone in golf , particularly the players , &quot; said PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem . 
&quot; He put up a tremendously courageous fight . 
this is a tragic situation and he will be missed by all of us . 
&quot; But he will also be remembered in a very positive way because of the kind of individual he was , &quot; Finchem said . 
players , caddies and fans wore green ribbons at PGA events in recent months in support of Medlen .
