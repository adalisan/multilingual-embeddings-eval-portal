the Indonesian rupiah remained firm against the dollar in late trading on Monday as fears over campaign violence calmed down , dealers said . 
they said a relatively expensive overnight rate was also keeping operators cautious as the month-end approached . 
&quot; I expected the rupiah to recover today but not in a 10-point magnitude . 
it &apos;s a surprise , &quot; one Japanese bank dealer said , adding that the tight market was also not factored in . 
he said the tight rupiah market had played a major role in cooling down the dollar . 
overnight rupiah rose to 14.0 percent from 10.5 percent in the morning . 
overnight swap ended at 0.60 / 0.65 points . 
spot rupiah rose to a high of 2,426.5 before settling at 2,426.5 / 27.0 at 0915 GMT from an opening of 2,435.5 / 36.5 . 
tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,426.0 / 26.5 and 2,429.5 / 30.0 . 
respectively . 
the Japanese bank dealer said he expected the rupiah to remain steady on Tuesday , with operators keeping an eye out for further developments on the streets . 
the campaigning period will last to May 23 for the general elections on May 29 . 
the campaign on Tuesday proceeded without any major reports of incidents after a smooth start on Sunday . 
Saleh Aziz , treasury manager of PT Bank Export Import Indonesia , said the rupiah was expected to recover gradually if things remained under control . 
&quot; I think the rupiah will go back to the bid side of the central bank ( intervention ) band and people will start to focus on the liquidity issue again , &quot; Aziz said . 
Aziz said it would be difficult for the dollar to touch the 2,440 level again , broken last week after the market factored in possible disruption during the campaign . 
dealers said the relatively expensive rupiah on Monday was also attributable to dollar purchases last week which needed to be financed with the local currency . 
the Japanese bank dealer said longer-term swap rates were little changed while rupiah financing for the dollar buying was done through short-term swaps . 
one-month swap was at 12.0 / 13.0 , two at 25.25 / 26.00 , three at 37.25 / 38.0 and six at 74.25 / 74.25 points . 
Bank Indonesia raised its intervention band by two points to 2,406 / 2,598 but lowered the conversion band by seven points to 2,406 / 2,454 on Monday .
