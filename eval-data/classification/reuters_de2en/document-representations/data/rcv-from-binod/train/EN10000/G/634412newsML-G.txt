former interior minister Jean-Louis Debre was appointed interim secretary-general of President Jacques Chirac &apos;s Gaullist RPR party on Tuesday , two days after the right was swept from government in a parliamentary election . 
Debre , 52 , son of the late Gaullist prime minister Michel Debre , was appointed by party leader Alain Juppe , who is staying on as RPR president despite mounting calls for his removal after he led the centre-right defeat and lost the premiership . 
Juppe told a news conference he would summon a congress later this year to elect the movement &apos;s new president , adopt policy proposals and &quot; decide on the necessary opening to create a great political force committed to supporting the action of President Jacques Chirac &quot; . 
he did not say he would be a candidate to keep the party leadership , but he made clear he had no intention of yielding to growing calls from supporters of left-wing Gaullist rival Philippe Seguin for his immediate resignation . 
the brief announcement followed a day in which more than a dozen senior Gaullists had called for Seguin to replace Juppe at the helm of the battered party , which lost more than half of its parliamentary seats in last Sunday &apos;s runoff . 
Debre was a hardline interior minister popular with right-wingers but hated by the left and intellectuals for his legislation to crack down on illegal immigration , which prompted big street demonstrations earlier this year .
