concerns that last week &apos;s rains came too late to help U.S. corn and speculation that cool weather in the coming weeks would further damage crops pushed CBOT corn futures higher on Tuesday , traders said . 
&quot; I think people are going to be disappointed with the quality of the corn , &quot; said Jack Scoville , analyst with The Price Group . 
&quot; As we get closer to harvest , people are going to be more disappointed in the corn than in the beans . 
corn ended four to 2-3 / 4 cents per bushel higher with December up 3-3 / 4 at $ 2.67-1 / 4 . 
traders pointed to the U.S. Agriculture Department &apos;s weekly crop update which showed only a modest improvement . 
on Monday , the USDA rated the corn crop 60 percent good to excellent versus 58 percent a week ago . 
some traders had been expecting last week &apos;s rains to boost the ratings by as much as five percent , they said . 
forecasts for cool weather next week and into September added to the crop concerns . 
the National weather Service six- to 10-day outlook called for below normal temperatures in the U.S. Midwest and the 30-day outlook predicted cool temperatures in September . 
those forecasts led to talk of stunted crop growth and early freeze possibilities . 
the market was watching reports from the Professional Farmers of America annual corn and soybean tour . 
participants on one route of the first leg through northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana said yield potential varied widely but most fields appeared to be average to above average . 
scouts said one field in northeast Indiana had minor corn borer damage but other fields were largely free of insect damage and disease . 
they added that the crops needed warm weather to boost development , which would help avoid crop damage should there be an early freeze . 
on the day , commercials were largely on the sell-side which traders attributed to hedging activity . 
Cargill Inc sold three million bushels December , Farmers commodities Corp sold two million December and Term commodities sold one million September and two million December . 
funds offset the commercial hedging , led by Refco Inc . Refco bought at least six million bushels December , pit sources said . 
Smith Barney and Cargill investor Services were also said to be buyers . 
Tenco Inc spread two million September / December at 3-3 / 4 to four cents . 
in options , Louis Dreyfus bought 600 September $ 2.60 puts at 1-3 / 4 cents , Smith Barney bought 700 December $ 2.40 puts at 2-3 / 4 cents and sold 700 December $ 2.60 puts at 9-1 / 4 cents . 
ADM sold 350 December $ 2.80 puts at 8-1 / 4 cents and $ 2.80 calls at 21 cents , traders said . 
corn futures volume was estimated by CBOT at 38,000 contracts , compared with Monday &apos;s actual volume of 41,127 .
