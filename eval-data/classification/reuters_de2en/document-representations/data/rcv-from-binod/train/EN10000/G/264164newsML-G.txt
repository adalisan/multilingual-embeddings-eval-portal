Jordan &apos;s Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti said on Wednesday Israeli expansion of settlements in the West Bank threatened final status talks with Palestinians and posed a direct threat to Jordanian stability . 
&quot; We consider the settlement process , if it is achieved and exercised on the ground , to be a process whose end result will ... terminate the chances of success for negotiations of the final stage ( of Israeli-Palestinian talks ) , &quot; Kabariti told a news conference at the end of the visit by Tunisian Prime Minister Hamed Karoui . 
Jordanian officials have expressed increasing frustration with what they say is Israel &apos;s footdragging on implementing peace accords with Palestinians , warning it endangered the whole Middle East peace process . 
Jordan feels particularly threatened by the possibility of stepped-up Jewish settlement after Israel announced last week financial benefits to West Bank settlements . 
officials say any unrest in the neighbouring West Bank could spill over the banks of the Jordan River to affect Jordan too . 
Palestinians , who fled the West Bank during wars with Israel in 1948 and 1967 , form a large proportion of Jordan &apos;s population . 
&quot; In Jordan we feel a grave warning and great danger that threatens our national security in future , &quot; Kabariti said , adding he would convey to Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy , due in Amman on Thursday , the dangers of the settlement policy . 
he said trust between Jordan and Israel which underpinned their 1994 peace treaty was being undermined by failure to speedily implement peace accords based on swapping land for peace , a principle opposed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . 
&quot; How can we talk about the peace process as based on Madrid framework and based on the land for peace formula and then talk about settlements ? 
&quot; he asked . 
Kabariti accused Israel of creating conditions on the scale of a &quot; human catastrophe &quot; in Palestinian areas by failing to honour implementation of its peace accords with Palestinians . 
&quot; It &apos;s a matter that lays the foundations for a situation , God forbid , that could in the first confrontation explode and move towards bloody confrontations , &quot; he said . 
he said Jordan risked losing most amongst its neighbours from a renewed cycle of violence in Palestinian areas . 
&quot; This creates a catastrophic human situation that will not only threaten the Palestinian people alone ... Maybe Jordan will be the first of the countries that will be harmed , &quot; he said . 
about 130,000 Jews live in the settlements scattered among two million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza . 
Kabariti said Jordan would from now on judge Israel on its actions , not on what he said were publicity and photo calls . 
expressing exasperation with a long delayed Israeli pullout from parts of the West Bank town of Hebron , Kabariti said : &quot; The situation can no longer tolerate taking two steps back after every small step forward .
