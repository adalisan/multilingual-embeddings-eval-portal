a new bull market for copper has begun , with global supply / demand seen tight at least through the first half of 1997 , Simon Hunt Strategic Services said . 
in its latest &quot; copper Advisory Service &quot; , Hunt said the tightness will be carried on into the second quarter of 1997 , which will be reflected in prices , premia , and the backwardation . 
in the first half of 1997 , global stocks are seen being drawn down by over 200,000 tonnes , with China requiring an increasing amount of imported cathodes . 
although Hunt currently forecast a surplus of 300,000 tonnes for the second half of next year this may not take place . 
consumption growth may be higher than the 1.4 percent being forcast , production growth may be lower , due to delayed start-ups , while there may be less exports from the CIS , Hunt said .
