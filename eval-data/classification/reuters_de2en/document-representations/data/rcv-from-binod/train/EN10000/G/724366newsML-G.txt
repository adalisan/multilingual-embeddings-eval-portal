Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz &apos;s anti-Islamist government won a confidence vote in parliament on Saturday by a vote of 280 to 256 , according to unofficial results . 
two deputies abstained and about a dozen skipped the vote in the 550-seat legislature , in which Yilmaz and his allies needed a simple majority . 
the vote confirmed a return to power for Turkey &apos;s secularists , after one year and one day under the modern republic &apos;s first Islamist government .
