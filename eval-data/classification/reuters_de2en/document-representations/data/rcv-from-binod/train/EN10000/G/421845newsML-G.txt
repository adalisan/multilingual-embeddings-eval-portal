U.S. Defence Secretary William Cohen on Wednesday held what he called &quot; warm &quot; dicussions with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on the American military presence in Europe and later met senior NATO commanders on Bosnia peacekeeping . 
Cohen met Kohl in Bonn for 45 minutes midway through a European trip , then flew to Stuttgart for talks with U.S. army generals George Joulwan , Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces in Europe ( SACEUR ) , and William Crouch , commander of NATO forces in Bosnia and of American forces in Europe . 
Cohen told reporters flying with him that Kohl expressed satisfaction with progress on NATO enlargement and urged a continued presence of American forces in Germany , where the United States now has about 75,000 troops . 
&quot; It was very good , a very warm period . 
we have a very cordial conversation , &quot; Cohen said , adding that Kohl expressed pleasure at Cohen &apos;s recent appointment as Defence Secretary because Cohen had long been interested in European affairs as a former U.S. senator . 
&quot; He thinks it &apos;s important that people be involved who have an understanding of U.S.-German relations certainly , but all of NATO , &quot; Cohen said . 
&quot; We discussed several key things . 
he feels it is very important that the United States maintains its presence in Germany and in Europe , &quot; the secretary said . 
&quot; He knows that from time to time there are members ( of the U.S. Congress ) who call for a reduction of U.S. forces , but he wanted me to know how important it was for the United States to remain engaged . 
Cohen said Kohl also stressed the importance of the upcoming summit in Helsinki between Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin because of the need to move forward on Washington-Moscow relations . 
&quot; He ( Kohl ) felt that we are making progress as far as NATO enlargement and pursuing the NATO-Russia charter , but talked at some length about the importance of moving forward with President Yeltsin , &quot; said Cohen . 
&quot; And so he was encouraging and somewhat optimistic about how things are unfolding . 
Cohen said he and Kohl also discussed the dispute between the United States and France over continuing the American military command of NATO forces in southern Europe based in Naples . 
Cohen said he had again insisted that the U.S. retain command of the area , but was now willing to review that decision &quot; in four , five or six years &quot; with the possibility of giving in to a French demand to give up the command to a European officer or share it with Europe . 
&quot; I think he ( Kohl ) fully understands that and is looking for creative ways in which we can hopefully still bring France into the NATO alliance , &quot; the secretary said . 
Cohen held the talks midway through a four-day trip to Germany , Bosnia , Italy and NATO headquarters in Brussels , his first foreign venture since becoming secretary in late January . 
Cohen said his talks with Joulwan and Crouch would include the possible beefing up of police forces in the northern Bosnia trouble spot of Brcko and the NATO troop presence in that war-torn country .
