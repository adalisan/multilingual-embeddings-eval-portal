output in the British manufacturing industry slumped in May , hit badly by the strong pound , but analysts said on Monday the independent Bank of England was still likely to raise interest rates this week . 
sterling immediately slid by more than one pfennig on the surprise news and the price of government bonds , or gilts , recovered from opening lows . 
manufacturing output came in well below expectations , showing a decline of 1.1 percent in May , compared with forecasts of a small increase of 0.2 percent . 
it was the biggest fall in output since June 1993 , when there was a drop of 1.4 percent , the Office for National Statistics said . 
the one percent rise in output year-on-year compared with analysts &apos; forecasts of 2.5 percent . 
industrial output as a whole fell 0.9 percent in May over April and by 0.2 percent from the year-ago period . 
analysts said the slump in British manufacturing , which contrasts sharply with a booming consumer sector , highlighted the dilemma facing the Bank of England . 
the Bank , given the authority to set interest rates just days after the Labour government took office in May , is widely expected to raise interest rates this week to cool down the strong consumer demand . 
but that could make the situation for British manufacturers even worse , driving up the price of their exports and making them less competitive on international markets . 
the expectations of a rate rise hit the market after the new Labour government &apos;s first budget , which was seen as doing nothing to restrain demand . 
Gerard Lyons , chief economist at DKB International , said the latest manufacturing data would set alarm bells ringing . 
&quot; But , unfortunately , I do not think they will stop the authorities raising rates . 
these figures highlight the problem of consumers doing well with all the problems falling on manufacturing , &quot; he said . 
the Bank of England &apos;s new Monetary Policy Committee meets this week and will announce its decisionn on interest rates on Thursday . 
official British interest rates now stand at 6.5 percent , having been raised by 1 / 4 point three times since last October . 
some economists expect rates to rise as high as eight percent in the current cycle . 
mark bays , at HSBC futures ( corrects institution ) , said , &quot; The market hasn &apos;t changed its mind about a rate rise this week . 
it &apos;s expecting something rather than nothing on Thursday . 
Glenn Davies , at Credit Lyonnais added , &quot; I don &apos;t think they ( the Monetary Policy Committee ) will respond to the manufacturing figures . 
they will be looking at the consumer demand which is far too strong . 
however , some traders on the foreign exchange market thought the weak British figures might now mean that the Bank of England will raise rates by only 1 / 4 point rather than the 1 / 2 point some economists had been tipping last week . 
as a result sterling traded down at 2.9340 marks shortly after the publication of the figures , from around 2.95 in earlier trading . 
government bonds also took heart after taking a hammering last week . 
the September gilts contract rose to 114-23 / 32 from 114-17 / 32 before the data .
