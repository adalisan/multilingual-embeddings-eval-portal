Miami has a $ 38.9 million deficit for fiscal 1997 , but will not seek a property tax increases , city commissioners decided . 
the deficit figure , disclosed by acting City Manager Merrett Stierheim at a Thursday night commission meeting , represents about 14 percent of the city &apos;s $ 275 million operating budget . 
Stierheim proposed leaving the property tax rate at $ 11.7055 per $ 1,000 of assessed value , and compensating for the deficit by raising service charges and fees , cutting expenses , using short-term loans , and transferring or laying off some employees . 
the City Commission unanimously accepted Stierheim &apos;s recommendation , though details still must be worked out before a final budget is adopted for the fiscal year beginning Oct 1 . 
Stierheim described the fiscal problems as &quot; manageable &quot; and said he expected no credit impact . 
&quot; There should be no concern over bond default or that bondholders are at risk , &quot; he said . 
Stierheim said the city would carry over a $ 19.4 million deficit from fiscal 1996 , which ends Sept 30 . 
the remaining $ 19.5 million of the decifit was due to overbudgeted revenue and underbudgeted expenses . 
Stierheim blamed the problems on inadequate checks and balances in the city &apos;s finance department but did not blame anyone by name . 
the budget shortfall was discovered after the resignation of City Manager Cesar Odio , who was charged by federal prosecutors earlier this month with conspiring to solicit bribes in relation to city contracats . 
city Commissioner Miller Dawkins was also charged in the bribery case , and prosecutors said former City Finance Director Manohar Surana had agreed to plead guilty on related charges . 
Surana resigned in August , shortly before federal prosecutors revealed he had worn a hidden wire to record conversations implicating the others .
