U.S. treasuries continued to push lower at the long end in London on Tuesday , but shorter maturities managed to cling on to New York &apos;s closing levels , traders said . 
August leading indicators and September auto sales were also set for release . 
&quot; We &apos;re gentaly squeezing back in London , &quot; said a trader at a Japanese bank in London . 
&quot; Volume is desperately low . 
there &apos;s not a lot of commitment from investors ahead of the figures . 
the long bond was quoted at 97-20 in London , yielding 6.939 percent , down 2 / 32 from Tokyo and 6 / 32 from New York on Monday . 
two-year notes were steady on New York &apos;s close at 99-26 , three-year notes stable at 99-10 and five-years static at 99-21 . 
the bellweather bond lost 7 / 32 on Monday as August homes sales soared 4.7 percent to an annualised 832,000 , their highest level since April 1986 . 
the trader at the Japanese bank said banks were loaded up with paper of two-years and under but were beginning to extend along the curve . 
&quot; Generally , we &apos;ve been moving higher on weak data rather than moving lower on stronger data so we &apos;re in pretty good shape , &quot; he said . 
economists surveyed by Reuters expected the NAPM to show a reading of 52.5 in September , little changed from August &apos;s 52.6 . 
&quot; We &apos;re looking for 52.0 , &quot; said Klaus Baader , senior economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London . 
&quot; We expect the suppliers deliveries index to decline . 
he expected the prices paid index to come in slightly higher at 49 to take account of higher industrial commodity prices , including oil , but noted those prices had now receded . 
leading indicators were expected to rise 0.2 percent in August from a 0.2 percent rise in July . 
Baader said the market should be able to digest all the data without too much trouble , particularly since it declined on Monday .
