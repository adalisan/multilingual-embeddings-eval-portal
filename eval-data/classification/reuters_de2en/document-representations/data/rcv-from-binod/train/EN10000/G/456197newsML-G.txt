French climber Alain Robert , the notorious &quot; Spiderman , &quot; was caught on Thursday scaling the Petronas Twin Towers , the world &apos;s tallest buildings . 
the Frenchman , who has climbed some of the world &apos;s best-known buildings , was arrested as he reached the 60th floor of the towers -- 28 stories short of its peak , police said . 
at 451.9 metres ( 1,482 feet ) , the towers surpass the previous height record holder , the sears Tower in Chicago , by 10 metres ( 33 feet ) . 
owned by Malaysia &apos;s national oil and gas corporation , Petronas , the towers have been under construction since 1992 and are due to be completed this year . 
&quot; He was spotted on the 12th floor , but we waited until we could reach him on the 60th floor and grabbed him , &quot; Zainal Abidin Ali , police chief for the Dang Wangi district in Kuala Lumpur , told a news conference . 
Zainal said Robert could be held a day or two before being produced in court on charges of trespassing . 
if convicted , he could be fined up to 2,000 ringgit ( $ 807 ) or jailed up to a year . 
Robert , 34 , made headlines last month when he was arrested climbing the Sydney Tower in Australia , armed with only chalk powder , three ropes , some masking tape and a spring-loaded metal clip used for joining ropes together called a karabiner . 
among the 30 structures he has climbed since 1994 are New York &apos;s Empire State Building , London &apos;s Canary Wharf and the Far East Finance Centre in Hong Kong . 
his exploits have earned him nicknames such as &quot; Spiderman &quot; , &quot; Madman &quot; , &quot; Human Fly &quot; and &quot; Big Little Man &quot; .
