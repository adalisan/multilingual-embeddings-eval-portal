Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Friday that strong U.S. economic growth and low inflation is sustainable as long as the country maintains fiscal discipline . 
&quot; I think it is sustainable -- this solid growth with low inflation , &quot; Rubin said to reporters following a speech to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation legislative conference . 
he said as long as the federal government remains on a path of deficit reduction , financial markets will not redevelop a deficit premium and interest rates will then remain consistent with long-term growth .
