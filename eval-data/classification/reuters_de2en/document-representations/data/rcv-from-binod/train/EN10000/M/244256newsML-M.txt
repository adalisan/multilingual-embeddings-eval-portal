Argentina could issue a jumbo mark Eurobond before the end of 1996 , new issues traders in London and Frankfurt said on Monday . 
the issue could be for between 750 million and 1.0 billion marks at a five- or 10-year maturity , some dealers said . 
others said terms for the Eurobond were still very vague and it was too early to comment . 
&quot; The amount is still open , it depends , they ( Argentina ) have not yet made up their mind but 1.0 billion marks is possible , &quot; a syndicate manager at a German bank said . 
&quot; It would be a benchmark , &quot; he added . 
other countries like Denmark and Spain recently tapped the mark sector , but spreads on their bonds widened due to weak end-of-year investor demand , dealers said . 
however , Argentina would target retail investor demand for higher-yielding assets . 
&quot; Argentina will target a different investor base , &quot; a Frankfurt syndicate manager said . 
another syndicate manager said Argentina was seeking longer-dated funds so a 10-year issue was most likely . 
its last 10-year issue -- launched in March and increased -- was priced to yield 475 basis points over Bunds via CSFB-Effectenbank and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
it paid an 11.25 percent coupon and some said the issue could serve to help price the next bond . 
it was last trading at 410 b.p. 
over Bunds , dealers said . 
CSFB and Deutsche were in the running to lead manage the transaction given their history of underwriting for sovereign borrowers this year , traders said . 
&quot; But Argentina has many relationships with investment banks so there will be a lot of competitive bidding , &quot; a trader said . 
in early November , Finance Secretary Pablo Guidotti said Argentina was considering issuing between $ 1.5 billion and $ 2.0 billion in bonds this year to finance 1997 spending . 
last week Argentina tapped the lira sector with a 600 billion lire 10-year bond and also issued a 50 billion yen six-year Samurai bond . 
it last tapped the mark sector with a 500 million mark 30-year bond on October 23 . 
in May it raised 750 million marks via two callable Eurobonds -- one at seven and the other at 20 years . 
also in May it raised a total of 1.5 billion marks at three and 15 years .
