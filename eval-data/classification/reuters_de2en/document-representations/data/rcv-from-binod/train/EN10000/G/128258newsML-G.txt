a roadside charge blew up and killed two pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) militiamen and wounded two others in the Jewish state &apos;s south Lebanon occupation zone on Friday , Israeli security sources said . 
they said the incident occurred in the eastern sector of Israel &apos;s self-declared security zone at approximately 0400 GMT but gave no further details . 
Israel carved out the 15 km ( nine mile ) -wide occupation zone when it withdrew the bulk of its 1982 Lebanon invasion force in 1985 . 
pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust Israel from the zone . 
in April , Israel launched an air , sea , and naval bombardment against Lebanon spurred by the guerrillas rocketing northern Israel . 
some 200 Lebanese , most civilians , were killed in the onslaught . 
no Israelis were killed . 
that fighting ended with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire forbidding the sides to fire from or on civilian areas .
