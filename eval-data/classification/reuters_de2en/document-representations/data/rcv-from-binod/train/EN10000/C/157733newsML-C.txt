British conglomerate Lonrho plc said on Thursday it expected to announce that it has sold its 10 luxury Princess hotels next month . 
speaking after the 327 million stg sale of its Metropole hotels to UK hotels and casinos group Stakis , a company spokesman told Reuters : &quot; Lonrho expects to announce the sale ( of the Princess hotels ) in approximately three weeks . 
he declined to be drawn on who was bidding for the Princess chain , which includes resorts in Acapulco , Mexico , the Caribbean and the U.S .. 
Saudi billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal has been tipped as the most likely buyer of the five-star hotels . 
financial sources in the Gulf said earlier this month that the prince had exclusive rights to negotiate a deal at $ 300 million . 
the sale of the hotels is part of Lonrho &apos;s plans to focus on its mining operations .
