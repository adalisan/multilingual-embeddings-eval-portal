an accomplished 89 from Michael DiVenuto in only his fourth one-day international spearheaded Australia &apos;s charge to 258 for seven in their 50 overs against South Africa on Tuesday . 
the left-handed Tasmanian dominated the scoring but Australia failed to rub in their advantage in this fifth game of the seven-match series when DiVenuto fell with the total on 160 . 
fellow opener Greg Blewett contributed 36 to an opening stand of 93 and Jason Gillespie made the most of an unaccustomed role as pinch-hitter with 26 from 30 balls . 
a late assault from Michael Bevan ( 32 ) and Adam Gilchrist ( 26 ) was needed to give the tourists a defendable total on a flat pitch . 
the pair added 42 for the sixth wicket in less than six overs , with Gilchrist making his runs from just 17 balls . 
DiVenuto raced past his previous best score of 23 and was a shade unlucky to be out lbw to Allan Donald after hitting 11 fours from 114 balls . 
but television replays suggested he was lucky to escape a caught-behind off Shaun pollock when he had made just eight .
