London cocoa futures survived a surprise hike in UK interest rates unscathed at the close and even recorded small gains after an initial pounding . 
&quot; It seems to have held pretty well despite the currency shift , &quot; said one trader . 
sterling got a shot in the arm after the UK Chancellor Kenneth Clark announced a quarter-point rise in rates to six percent . 
it romped up to a 19-month peak against the dollar of $ 1.6348 and 22-month high against the mark of 2.4655 . 
a strong sterling usually attracts origin selling into cocoa , but traders associated the latest wave of selling with protective trade action and belated hedging . 
the benchmark March contract was hammered to a new contract low of 951 stg a tonne at the opening of the afternoon but recovered at the close to 964 stg , just below the session high of 965 , representing a rise of three stg . 
other contracts incurred similar gains except the front December and the distant March which ended marginally weaker . 
turnover reached a moderate 5,326 lots . 
the market structure widened slightly , with Dec / March trading at 30 stg and March / Dec at 58 stg . 
Wednesday &apos;s advance was seen unlikely to improve the market &apos;s overall jittery sentiment while industry were reluctant to sway from their current hand-to-mouth buying policy . 
&quot; Consumers won &apos;t buy in a weaker market ... physical bean and butter ratios are also easing , &quot; said one German trader . 
cocoa arrivals in top grower Ivory Coast were slower than normal but exporters expected the rhythm to speed up in the next couple of weeks . 
warehouses were already filling up in Abidjan as exporters awaited licences and a decision on freight rates . 
technical resistance is expected around the closing levels , and then at 990 stg on March , with support pegged at the session low of 951 stg followed by 942 on the continuation chart .
