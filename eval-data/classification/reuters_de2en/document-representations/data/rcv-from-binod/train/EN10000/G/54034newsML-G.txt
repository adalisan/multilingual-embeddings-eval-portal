Cuban President Fidel Castro spent three hours on Saturday meeting members of a U.S.-Cuba solidarity group who donated more than 400 computers to the communist-ruled island , Cuban news reports said . 
the so-called Peace caravan of some 100 people , including some Canadian citizens , arrived in Havana on Friday with the equipment . 
the official news agency Prensa Latina said Castro told the group he was confident Cuba would maintain the successes of its revolution . 
the agency did not give other details of the meeting . 
the computers , aimed at helping modernise Cuba &apos;s state health system , were impounded by U.S. authorities last January at the U.S. border with Mexico . 
several members of the Peace caravan staged a hunger strike to protest the action and the computers were eventually released in May . 
the United States maintains a longstanding economic embargo against Cuba and allows humanitarian donations only if they have been licensed . 
critics of the embargo such as the organisers of the Peace caravans to Cuba say such licenses should not be necessary . 
the Peace caravans , which made several trips to Cuba in recent years , were organised by a church group called pastors for Peace .
