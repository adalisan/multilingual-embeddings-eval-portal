Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni visits South Africa &apos;s Nelson Mandela from Monday , bringing together two men whose shared vision of an African rebirth has been bolstered by a change of rule in former Zaire . 
both men are set to wield a strong influence over Laurent Kabila &apos;s renamed Democratic Republic of Congo , Africa &apos;s third largest and mineral-rich country which is now firmly in their spheres of influence , analysts say . 
Museveni , who denies managing backstage his friend Kabila &apos;s overthrow of Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko , will meet Mandela in Cape Town on Tuesday during a four-day state tour . 
&quot; The visit further symbolises the close ties which have long since existed between President Museveni &apos;s government and the present South African government , &quot; Pretoria &apos;s foreign ministry said . 
Mandela paid a state visit to Uganda in October . 
the Ugandan leader , who 11 years ago ousted Milton Obote -- the ruthless successor to notorious dictator Idi Amin -- said in a recent interview he had been pressing Mandela to promote a common market for southern and eastern Africa , including Congo . 
Mandela and Museveni are old friends . 
they share a vision of an economically successful , well-governed and uncorrupt Africa that , having rid itself of European colonialism , will also see off decades of post-independence misrule by homegrown despots . 
Museveni has exported his vision to neighbouring states but critics say such hopes are a pipedream and are sceptical about the democratic credentials of Kabila , Museveni &apos;s protege . 
but Museveni has turned Uganda into one of Africa &apos;s economic success stories , earning praise from international financial institutions , while Mandela chides pessimists who see Africa as doomed to a cycle of famine , war , corruption and dictatorship . 
&quot; I am convinced that our region and our continent have set out along the new road of lasting peace , democracy and social and economic development , &quot; Mandela said last week , a day after Kabila entered his capital Kinshasa . 
&quot; The time has come for Africa to take full responsibility for her woes and use the immense collective wisdom it possesses to make a reality of the ideal of the African renaissance , whose time has come . 
after a slow start following his historic election in 1994 as South Africa &apos;s first black president , Mandela has intervened increasingly in African crises , arguing that his country needs a stable and prosperous continent if it is to thrive . 
in an interview for a Sunday newspaper , he said he thought South African diplomacy had helped ensure Kabila &apos;s takeover of Kinshasa after Mobutu fled without the much-feared bloodbath . 
Africa &apos;s most revered leader , he is due to retire from politics by 1999 , but told the Johannesburg Sunday Times he would not rule out a role as a global elder statesman . 
&quot; I am facing pressure from inside and outside the country as well . 
if they want me to play a particular role , I &apos;ve got an open mind .
