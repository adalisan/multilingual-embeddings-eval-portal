CSCE world sugar futures closed slightly higher in uneventful dealings Friday , as speculative buying and scale-up trade selling once again confined the market to a narrow trading band . 
with little fresh news to go on , the market drifted in narrowly firmer territory for most of the session . 
scattered buying by locals and commodity funds propped the market up most of the day but a late round of liquidation sliced into the gains , dealers said . 
&quot; It looked good going into the close near 11.00 cents , but I think there were just too many longs in the market , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; The specs weren &apos;t anxious to take on any new longs ahead of the weekend . 
may futures gained 0.04 cent a lb on the day , to close at 10.97 cents , after trading from 10.93 to 11.03 . 
traders stepped up pressure on the nearby switch before the close , shaving 0.02 cent off May &apos;s premium to July . 
the spread closed at 0.23 cent , from 0.25 on Thursday . 
the day &apos;s volume was estimated at 12,380 lots , compared with 9,507 lots on Thursday . 
although May settled off the highs , traders said its close above 10.95 cents would aid the market &apos;s start next week . 
&quot; I think we have a good shot of running up to the mid-February highs toward 11.20 cents , &quot; the trader said . 
but further gains could prove difficult , as speculators remained wary of adding to their already hefty long positions . 
traders estimated that speculators could be net long up to 30,000 lots on the May contract , which carried a total open interest of 73,206 as of Thursday &apos;s close .
