Hong Kong celebrated its last Lunar New Year under British rule on Friday with floats and flowers and its next leader urged the 6.3 million population to focus less on politics after the handover to China . 
&quot; I really hope that after the handover on July 1 , 1997 , that our society will not be as politicised and we can focus more on livelihood issues such as housing , education and welfare , &quot; Chief Executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa said in an address ushering in the Year of the ox . 
Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 after more than 150 years of British rule , which Beijing this week branded a humiliating disgrace . 
standing beside a traditional peach blossom tree festooned with red &quot; Lai see , &quot; or lucky money , envelopes , Tung urged Hong Kong people to respect Chinese cultural values of family , compassion and , particularly , harmony . 
&quot; When we Chinese speak of &apos; the doctrine of the equilibrium &apos; , we mean not to go to the extremes , &quot; he said . 
but the Year of the ox appeared to begin inauspiciously when one person was killed and 31 injured after a float ploughed into a crowd on onlookers at a parade in the Tsim Sha Tsui hotel and entertainment district . 
a British female tourist was reported dead on arrival at hospital . 
two other people were seriously injured , one of them a policeman who tried to stop the float from running over two children . 
the dead woman was identified as B.A. 
Stevens , 45 , from Yorkshire , England . 
frenetic Hong Kong was unusually quiet for the holiday , with record numbers of people flowing across the border into China to visit relatives . 
buses and trains passing through the central business district were almost empty on Friday morning as the territory &apos;s mostly Chinese population spent the day visiting families and make offerings at temples . 
offices and shops were mostly shut . 
only a handful of ships passed through Hong Kong &apos;s harbour , usually the world &apos;s busiest , and even the territory &apos;s scores of newspapers took a day off from publishing . 
the mood was upbeat despite the driving rain which drenched buyers at the traditional flower market on Thursday night and made work more miserable for the clean-up crew on Friday . 
formal festivities will end with a fireworks and laser show on Saturday night . 
Tung , who was born in the Year of the ox in 1937 , said he hoped that people would recognize in him the ox virtues of industry , sincerity and perseverance . 
those characteristics could come in handy . 
Tung has been warned by Chinese fortune-tellers that he faces a difficult year in 1997 marked by envy and requiring compromise . 
Tung may also find his hope for a less politicised future difficult to realize . 
while politics took a holiday in Hong Kong and China , other parts of the world kept Hong Kong in the spotlight . 
speaking from Washington , Allen Lee , chairman of Hong Kong &apos;s pro-China , pro-business Liberal Party , said that reassuring U.S. lawmakers about the territory &apos;s future has become more difficult in the wake of China &apos;s plans to repeal or amend Hong Kong &apos;s civil liberties laws . 
some members of the European Parliament are urging the European Union to give passports to all Hong Kong citizens before the handover . 
China is scrapping the colony &apos;s elected Legislative Council and replacing it with a Beijing-backed provisional legislature . 
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said on Wednesday Hong Kong &apos;s return to the motherland would end &quot; the disgrace and humiliation China has suffered from for more than 150 years &quot; .
