LME three months copper drifted lower in late inter-office trading on Tuesday evening as values backed off from an earlier approach towards resistance at $ 2,290 a tonne . 
by 1900 GMT three months copper was indicated at $ 2,249 / 53 per tonne , slightly down from its afternoon kerb close of $ 2,255 , which was down $ 15 on the day . 
earlier , copper hit a high of $ 2,280 in a halfhearted attempt to vault resistance at $ 2,290 . 
&quot; The upside still remains the favoured direction , with the backwardation within the spread remaining firm , &quot; said Rudolf Woolf in its evening metal report . 
it added that most of the metal being delivered was arriving in the U.S. and being attributed to the inter-market arbitrage against COMEX . 
&quot; Therefore , unless continued and significant deliveries are seen into other locations , it can be assumed that there is little spare material in the system and that physical demand remains strong . 
traders noted the sharply higher copper output reported by Minera Escondida Ltda for December . 
total production reached 841,361 tonnes for all of last year , up about 80 percent from 1995 . 
the mine officially passed Codelco &apos;s Chuquicamata mine , which produces about 620,000 tonnes of copper a year , as the world &apos;s largest copper pit last year . 
reporting company operating results for 1996 , the chairman of Alumax Inc said world primary aluminium consumption appeared ready to resume its upward trend in 1997 after two years of essentially flat demand . 
the other metals were little changed .
