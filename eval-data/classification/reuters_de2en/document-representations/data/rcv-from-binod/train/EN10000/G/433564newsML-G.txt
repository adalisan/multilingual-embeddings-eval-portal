a Florida businessman has been sentenced to 10 years in prison without parole for defrauding the Medicare programme out of more than $ 47 million , federal prosecutors said . 
a federal judge in Kansas City sentenced Ben Caroll of Kissimee , Florida , on Monday for his role in the fraud . 
&quot; This was one of the largest Medicare fraud schemes in the country , &quot; U.S. Attorney Jackie Williams said in a statement late Monday . 
&quot; Carroll received the maximum sentence , which reflects the seriousness of the crime . 
under the scheme , Carroll supplied adult diapers to nursing home patients in Kansas and Florida and then submitted thousands of claims to Medicare for prosthetic devices . 
Medicare does not reimburse for adult diapers .
