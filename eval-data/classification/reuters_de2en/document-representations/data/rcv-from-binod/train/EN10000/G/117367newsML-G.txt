nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan , in an interview published on Tuesday , said he is sitting out the presidential election and will not urge his followers to vote for any candidate . 
I would not discourage our people from voting but I don &apos;t see any candidate that is worthy of my vote , &quot; he told the Chicago Sun-Times . 
&quot; I really don &apos;t see anyone that is in the best interest of our people and an agenda that is in the best interest of the masses . 
Farrakhan organised the Million Man March that drew hundreds of thousands of black men to Washington a year ago and was viewed at the time as a potential force in swaying a portion of the black vote . 
since the march , he has made controversial visits to Libya , Cuba , Iraq , Iran , Nigeria and Sudan , some of which Washington has branded as supporting terrorism . 
the U.S. Treasury Department barred him from accepting a $ 250,000 human rights award in Libya or $ 1 billion that Muammar Gaddafi , the Libyan leader , had pledged to the Nation of Islam after meeting Farrakhan in January . 
the Nation of Islam is thought to have about 10,000 active members .
