Tokyo corn futures ended lower across the board on Friday , pressured by the Chicago market &apos;s losses overnight , traders said . 
prices ranged from 240 yen to 420 yen per tonne lower . 
benchmark September was down 240 yen at 15,060 yen . 
daily volume was 45,122 lots . 
the market opened lower as selling emerged from the opening , but short-covering below the 15,000 yen level for the benchmark September prevented prices from falling further . 
activity was lacklustre ahead of the USDA &apos;s production report to be released later today . 
&quot; Market players were wary of taking fresh positions ahead of the USDA report . 
if U.S. corn production for 1996 is above 9.0 billion bushels , the Tokyo corn futures market could fall by around 500 yen per tonne from the current levels , &quot; one trader said .
