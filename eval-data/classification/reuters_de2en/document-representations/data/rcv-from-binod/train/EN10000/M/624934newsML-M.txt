Seoul stocks finished at a new 1997 high on Thursday , sparked by anticipation of an economic recovery and falling interest rates , brokers said . 
yields on benchmark three-year corporate bonds fell 0.08 percentage point to 11.90 percent . 
the composite stock index rose 4.38 points to 742.50 , off an intraday high of 749.37 . 
however , despite the index rise , losers outpaced gainers by 565 to 257 . 
&quot; Active participation by individual investors fuelled the bull-run in the market , &quot; said Lee Ki-ho , market strategist at LG Securities . 
brokers said large-cap shares , in particular cheap , big manufacturers , construction and financial companies , attracted strong interest as investors believed they would benefit from the strengthening yen and falling interest rates . 
the large-cap sub-index rose 9.83 points , or 1.84 percent , to 1,493.82 . 
but the smaller sub-index fell 32.82 points , or 1.68 percent , to 1,922.61 . 
LG electronics rose 800 won to 14,900 , off a new year high of 15,200 . 
it hit the second largest trading volume with 1.7 million shares . 
Daewoo Securities traded most actively with 1.74 million shares changing hands . 
&quot; The underlying market sentiment remains very positive . 
Large-cap shares will continue to lure buying interest , &quot; said Casey Choe of the Union Bank of Switzlerland . 
the Bank of Korea said the current account deficit narrowed to $ 1.7 billion in April from $ 2.36 billion a year earlier . 
&quot; This signals our economy is getting better , &quot; Lee said . 
but the central bank also said the ratio of South Korea &apos;s defaults on notes hit a 15-year high of 0.25 percent in April . 
brokers said the worries had been already reflected in the market after defaults by affiliates of the financially troubled Hanbo , Sammi and Jinro groups . 
brokers said active foreign buying spearheaded the recent rally . 
the Securities Supervisory Board said net foreign purchase totalled 70.3 billion won worth on Thursday . 
some traders said foreign investors were short-term punters . 
but Casey Choe said foreign fund managers had tried to expand their Korean investment tools after unloading their holdings since last year .
