Yen-based Tokyo palladium prices rose sharply on Wednesday on heavy buying by U.S. based Engelhard Corp , Japanese precious metal traders said . 
&quot; Engelhard has been buying massive amounts of palladium futures since Tuesday . 
it bought about 2,300 lots ( 3.45 tonnes ) on Tuesday and continued to buy large amounts today , &quot; a precious metals industry source said . 
an Engelhard official in Tokyo declined comment on their palladium transactions on the Tokyo commodity Exchange . 
traders said it was not clear why Engelhard had been buying large quantities of palladium futures on TOCOM . 
Engelhard was seen mainly buying the December , February and April palladium futures contracts , they said . 
on Wednesday , all TOCOM palladium futures contracts surged to close up by their daily 22 yen per gram daily limit , excluding limitless spot July , which ended 35 yen higher . 
benchmark June finished at 525 yen . 
Japanese traders speculated that Engelhard was aiming to lock in profits through arbitrage trade by buying TOCOM palladium which is substantially cheaper relative to dollar-based spot palladium . 
hefty profits can be made through this operation even if spot prices fall sharply after Russia resumes exports , they said . 
Engelhard may also be thinking of taking physical deliveries when the contracts expire in order to pass on supplies to their customers in the United States , traders said . 
traders widely suspect Russia &apos;s PGM exports will be delayed again next year . 
&quot; Engelhard has end-users in the United States . 
if they accept deliveries at the ( TOCOM ) spot expiry , they could probably export palladium to the U.S. , &quot; a bullion house official said . 
&quot; They ( Engelhard ) may be expecting Russian palladium shipments to be delayed again next year , &quot; he said . 
PGM shipments from Russia , which have been suspended since the beginning of this year , are expected to resume around July 10 , traders said . 
Russian officials have cited bureaucratic delays and changes in the structure of the precious metals markets as the main reasons for the delays , which have caused palladium prices to hit 17-year highs . 
Russia supplies 20 percent of the world &apos;s platinum and 60 percent of its palladium . 
Japan is the largest consumer of both metals .
