the Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) said on Thursday that the Maldivian economy was poised to improve with the two main industries , tourism and fisheries , providing a strong base for growth . 
but the environment in the Indian Ocean archipelago of 1,192 coral islands -- many no more than two metres ( six FT ) above sea level -- was inherently fragile and over-exploitation could easily lead to degradation , it said . 
&quot; The outlook for the Maldives remains positive with GDP growth expected to average six percent a year in 1997 and 1998 , &quot; the ADB said in its annual report . 
&quot; A continuing tight monetary policy , plus an increase in the number of tourists and a higher fish catch , led to a marked economic improvement in 1996 , &quot; it said . 
real gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth in 1996 was estimated at 6.5 percent while inflation was a low 3.5 percent , the report said without giving comparisons . 
reduced public spending and a tight monetary policy were expected to keep inflation subdued at about three percent in 1997 and 1998 , it said . 
the exceptionally high rates of economic growth reached in 1985-90 -- more than 10 percent a year on average -- could not be repeated in the near future owing to capacity constraints in both tourism and fisheries , the report said . 
but higher growth might be attainable beyond the turn of the century as new islands were opened to tourism and old resorts refurbished , and if more capital-intensive fishing methods were used , it said . 
about 86 islands have been developed as tourist resorts . 
the country earned $ 36 million from tourism in 1996 when more than 338,000 foreign tourists , 70 percent from Europe , visited the archipelago . 
the ADB said reforms were required in the tax system , the financial sector , the exchange rate and trade system , public enterprises , and the regulatory environment . 
&quot; The major fiscal challenges for the government remains the adequate provision of infrastructure and social services , while keeping inflation low through restraining public expenditure and maintaining a tight monetary policy , &quot; it said . 
the high rate of population growth , 2.8 percent a year , had led to rapid growth in demand for social services , it said . 
aspirations were also rising and demand was gradually shifting to relatively high-cost tertiary health care , and to secondary and post-secondary education , it added . 
total export earnings in 1996 rebounded to $ 91.7 million after a period of low growth in 1991-93 , it said . 
the current account deficit narrowed to an average of about five percent of GDP in 1994 and 1995 , and improved further last year , turning into a surplus of 1.7 percent of GDP , it said .
