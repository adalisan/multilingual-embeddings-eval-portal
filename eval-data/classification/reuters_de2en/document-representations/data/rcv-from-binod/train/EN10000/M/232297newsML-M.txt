CME hog futures were expected to open steady to 0.100 cent higher , with pork bellies steady to 0.250 cent firmer , analysts said . 
mostly steady to higher cash hog indications and weather-reduced hog runs in some areas were expected to prompt carryover demand in hog futures . 
packers have been showing good interest for the lighter than expected hog marketings , analysts said . 
producers have been holding back hogs for breeding and this is forcing packers to increase bids for hogs to obtain adequate slaughter numbers , they said . 
pork bellies were expected to show further strength after holding technical support above a gap in the charts Monday and then rallying to close higher . 
the firm tone to cash bellies following the continued lighter than expected hog slaughter pace is also supportive . 
cash belly prices ranged up to $ 74 per cwt Monday , highest price level since early October , analysts said . 
the light kills are also keeping storings down . 
Tuesday afternoon &apos;s CME out-of-town storage report will likely show that the light storage pace has continued and total stocks are holding under year ago levels , they said . 
estimates on the report ranged from unchanged to in 1.5 million lbs versus in 838,000 lbs last week and in 3.862 million lbs in the same period last year .
