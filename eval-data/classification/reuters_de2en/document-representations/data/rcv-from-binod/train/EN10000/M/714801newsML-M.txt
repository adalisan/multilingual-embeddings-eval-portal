Ferro-vanadium prices have firmed further amid talks of declining production in China , one of the world &apos;s major producers , due to a shortage of vanadium slabs , traders said on Tuesday . 
&quot; There &apos;s a gap between demand and supply . 
Ferro-vanadium prices will exceed $ 20 ( per kg ) in the near future , &quot; said a trader at one of Japan &apos;s major trading houses . 
traders in Tokyo said Chinese offers were drying up as Panzhihua Iron and Steel ( Group ) Corp , the country &apos;s sole supplier of vanadium slabs , appeared to have closed for maintainance . 
but in China , an official at Panzhihua &apos;s research department told Reuters the company had not stopped production of vanadium slab , the raw material for ferro vanadium . 
&quot; We never planned to stop production of vanadium slab , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Demand ( for vanadium slabs ) exceeds supply now . 
&quot; Our output of vanadium slab in 1996 was 83,334 tonnes , up from around 52,000 tonnes in 1995 , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Most of that volume is usually exported . 
Japanese traders said ferro-vanadium was quoted around $ 19-20 per kg , while the price of vanadium slab climbed to above $ 4 per pound . 
in China , local prices for the minor metal , used for special steel , have risen in the past few months and are now indicated at $ 19.50 / 20.00 per kg on a cost and freight ( C &amp; F ) basis , an official said . 
&quot; China &apos;s total output of ferro-vanadium is around 100,000 tonnes a year , though output in 1996 was less than that , &quot; the official at Panzhihua &apos;s affiliated trading company said by telephone from western Sichuan province . 
he also said the company accounted for 87 percent of China &apos;s total output and that 70 to 80 percent of Panzhihua &apos;s output was exported . 
in the Asian cobalt market , prices continued to firm , with high-grade cobalt quoted at $ 23-24 per pound and low-grade cobalt at $ 19-20 , traders said . 
end-users started to buy the metal as their hopes of lower prices were dashed , despite the expected resumption of sales by the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency ( dla ) in August and the end of a strike at a plant of Canada &apos;s INCO Ltd , they said . 
&quot; Stocks at large users and traders are running low . 
U.S. demand for super-alloy as well as Japanese demand for batteries is strong , &quot; said one trader in Tokyo . 
&quot; The price may go up by another dollar or two . 
keen buying interest from China had helped push cobalt prices up from recent dips , a trader in Bejing added . 
the magnesium market remained quiet , with Chinese special high-grade ( SHG ) quoted at $ 2,400-2,500 per tonne . 
yet traders in Tokyo said demand from beverage can makers might rise later this quarter if the current heat wave continued to grip Japan . 
&quot; We say one sunny day means 20 tonnes of additional magnesium , &quot; said one trader .
