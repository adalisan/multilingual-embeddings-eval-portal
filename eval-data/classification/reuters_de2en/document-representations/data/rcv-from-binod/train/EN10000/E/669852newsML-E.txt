Australian analysts , surprised by the prolonged softness in the economy , are beginning to consider the traditional Keynesian demand-dampening that might have stemmed from last year &apos;s big budget cuts . 
the fiscal demand-effects described by John Maynard Keynes earlier this century have been rather unfashionable in Australian economics in the past decade , and the Reserve Bank last year explicitly said it could not assume that budget cuts would restrain the economy , as Keynes &apos;s theory suggested . 
the conservative government and many economists argued last year that the private sector would step in to take up the slack , especially since fiscal restraint engenders business confidence . 
but the Australian economy ran out of steam in the second half of 1996 , around the time of a budget that took a huge 1.4 percent of GDP out of the economy , and it has remained soft as the budget &apos;s cuts and revenue hikes have come on stream . 
&quot; I think it ( the budget ) has had some effect , &quot; said Bankers Trust economist David Bassanese . 
&quot; It is obviously pushing in this direction , &quot; he told Reuters , adding that it was difficult to quantify the effect . 
J.P. Morgan economist John Kyriakopoulos named three factors that been pulling down the economy lately : a strong currency , rising real wages -- and the drag from the budget . 
national Australia Bank chief economist Alan Oster , who warned of the Keynesian effects from the budget last year , said forecasters should have realised what was coming . 
&quot; Every major economic model around the world has a short-term dynamic effect from fiscal constraint , &quot; he said . 
the Reserve Bank of Australia does not seem to have agreed with Oster and other economists who forecast Keynesian effects . 
in May 1996 , the bank &apos;s then deputy governor and now governor , Ian MacFarlane , was asked why the bank was not moving to loosen monetary policy before the promised budget cuts . 
he answered : &quot; ... if we look aound the world in the last decade or so at a number of countries where this ( the fiscal tightening ) has happened it is not at all clear that the standard Keynesian effects have resulted ... 
&quot; So our attitude is that you have to look at it ( the economy ) and see what is actually happening . 
you can &apos;t prejudge the answer . 
if you prejudge the answer it is usually going to be wrong . 
when the bank next eased monetary policy , in July , it cited subdued inflationary pressure but not prospective budget cuts . 
access Economics analyst Chris Richardson said the bulk of the 1996 budget &apos;s measures , annual savings of A $ 7 billion , were now in place . 
the budget was the biggest assault on Australian public finances since then Treasurer Paul Keating slashed into the deficit in the late 1980s . 
and it was Keating &apos;s budgets that helped diminish Australia &apos;s faith in Keynes , because in the late 1980s the economy kept running fast as Keating cut . 
but Oster said powerful external demand at the time was responsible , and the economy would have run even faster had the budget not been cut . 
Richardson said the 1980s fiscal cuts were overstated , anyway . 
the Federal fiscal tightening at the time was largely offset by state budgets driven into deficits by cuts to their Federal grants , he said . 
the May 1997 budget implemented cuts worth another A $ 2 billion a year , but mostly by toning down a savings bonus that has not yet started .
