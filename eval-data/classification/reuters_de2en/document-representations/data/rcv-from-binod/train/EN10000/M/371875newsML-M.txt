Zimbabwe industrial shares traded mostly softer on Wednesday in line with predictions that they were under price-correction pressure , but brokers said they expected a mixed market in the coming few days . 
&quot; Although there is some kind of pressure , the market has not quite made up its mind ... and no trend has developed yet . 
I think it will be swinging either way , but in narrow ranges , in the next couple of days , &quot; one broker said . 
&quot; Nobody is quite in charge yet ... and volumes are varying from day to day as investors test the market , &quot; he added . 
the main 57-counter industrial index -- which climbed 34.98 points up on Tuesday -- lost 12.58 points to close at 10,031.88 . 
the industrial index was dragged lower by losses in some heavyweight counters , including sugar producer Hippo Valley which dropped 50 cents to 1,400 and newspaper group Zimpapers , down 100 cents to 2,800 . 
sluggish trade by investors wary of generally low mineral prices drove the secondary seven-share mining index 27.50 points down to 949.01 . 
nickel producer Bindura and coal group Wankie lost five and 50 cents respectively to 750 and 500 , but gold giant Ashanti traded unchanged at 9,800 cents .
