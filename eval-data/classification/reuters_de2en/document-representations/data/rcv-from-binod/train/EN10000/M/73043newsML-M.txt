Dutch bonds followed bunds up on Tuesday and recouped most of Monday &apos;s losses , in almost dormant trade ahead of a possible Fed rate hike , traders said . 
they said a Fed rate hike of 25 points had been largely factored into the market . 
&quot; If it is ( a rise of ) 25 points , then I &apos;d expect to see things largely unaffected , &quot; one trader said . 
Tuesday &apos;s quiet trading was almost a mirror image of Monday &apos;s activity . 
bonds rose , the curve flattened and the spread versus bunds came in . 
Jan 2006s were up 0.28 , having fallen 0.37 on Monday . 
some traders said that , in the short term , the spread of bonds under bunds had probably peaked . 
the 10-year spread , for example , came back two basis points to 14 BP . 
in the longer term , the shortage of paper in the Dutch market was likely to keep bond yields high . 
&quot; If we have no new issue in Q4 , the spread will simply widen again , &quot; one trader said .
