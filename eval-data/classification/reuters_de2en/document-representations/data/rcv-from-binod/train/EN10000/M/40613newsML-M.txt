a lack of trending movement in foreign exchange rates is forcing traders -- both bank dealers and currency funds -- to adapt to a low-volatility era , a panel of long-time traders said on Monday . 
&quot; I &apos;m not saying trends won &apos;t develop , but they will be few and far between , &quot; Michael Waresh of California-based Strome and Susskind Investment Management said at a forex conference held by financial industry publication managed Account Report . 
Panelists agreed that a new twist was needed to survive , whether the sluggishness was temporary or structural . 
for instance , Peter Pfau , chief currency strategist at New York-based AIB Asset Management , questioned the viability of treating currencies as an asset class on their own . 
he said a good trade could have been made in the stagnant dollar / yen if a trader took advantage of interest-rate differentials . 
in general , panelists said depth on both sides of the market , due in part to the growth of currency-oriented funds helped by technological development , appeared to be hampering major one-way moves . 
Central banks &apos; concerted efforts to thwart inflation and their currency intervention in recent years also subdued volatility , they said . 
in addition , the end of the Cold War helped to immunize the market to political factors , they added . 
&quot; Forty cruise missiles in Iraq doesn &apos;t have any impact now , &quot; Pfau said of the market &apos;s short-lived reaction to recent U.S. attacks on Iraqi military facilities . 
for banks , shrinking bid / ask spreads and commissions have taken away their maneuvering room in proprietary trading , already pressured by growing wariness of risk-taking after recent financial disasters . 
for currency funds , a lack of viable trends and short-term oscillation are making going tough for their mainstay strategy of following fundamentals-driven long-term trends . 
still , while most of the discussion in the market these days could be about surviving in a low-volatility environment , panelists warned of the risk of a possible sudden swing . 
they agreed that the planned European Monetary Union was likely to be a major source of volatility in the coming years . 
&quot; In my view , this is a political decision , not an economic one , &quot; said Robert Tamiso of New York-based Tamiso &amp; Co . 
he noted the market &apos;s tendency to force &quot; reality checks &quot; on government efforts to control the market . 
&quot; If you agree that the Euro will happen and that GDP and debt threshold will not be allowed to stand in the way , then you must concentrate on how it will actually happen , &quot; he said . 
Scott Dillman , senior business manager of HSBC Midland , said he did not expect the Euro to take off and predicted large-scale unwinding of the European exchange-rate grid . 
he added that volatility should return to the market in general in the next year or two , based on his study of 50-day historic volatility in dollar / mark .
