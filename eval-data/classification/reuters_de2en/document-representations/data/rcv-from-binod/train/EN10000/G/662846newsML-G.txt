Steaua Bucharest have appointed Mihai Stoichita as their new coach to replace Dumitru Dumitriu , who resigned last week , the club &apos;s president said on Monday . 
at 43 , Stoichita is one Romania &apos;s youngest coaches and served as Dumitriu &apos;s deputy from 1993 . 
he had worked earlier as deputy coach at Dinamo Bucharest . 
Steaua president Marcel Puscas said Stoichita had been offered a one-year contract and that Marius Lacatus , 33 , would combine playing with the role of deputy coach . 
Dumitriu , meanwhile , revealed on Monday he had signed a one-year contract with Greek club AEK Athens . 
the surprise deal follows the Romanian soccer Federation &apos;s refusal to allow national team trainer Anghel Iordanescu to work with Romania and AEK Athens at the same time . 
Dumitriu resigned from Steaua in protest at moves by Puscas to end army patronage of the side . 
under Dumitriu , who was appointed in 1994 , Steaua won the national league three times and the Romanian Cup twice .
