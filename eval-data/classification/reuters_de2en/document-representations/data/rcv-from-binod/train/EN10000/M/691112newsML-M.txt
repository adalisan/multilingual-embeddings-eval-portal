the Philippine stock market &apos;s main index closed moderately higher for the third consecutive day on Thursday spurred by PLDT &apos;s gains and rotational buying in selected firstliner issues , brokers said . 
&quot; The market was inspired by PLDT &apos;s strong showing in New York and it touched other stocks that were components of the index , &quot; said Lisa Joson , research head at Amsteel Securities . 
the main index which was in a limited range for most of the session closed 7.81 points higher at 2,837.10 points . 
but the broader market was mixed with two decliners for every one gainer at 89 to 43 . 
turnover was heavy on Thursday at 2.8 billion pesos . 
traders said PLDT &apos;s climb by 30 pesos to 870 pesos at close could also be attributed to expectations of improved second quarter earnings and that its proposed rate restructuring would get government approval by the second half of the year . 
other blue chips that supported the index were Ayala Land Inc , Pilipino telephone Corp and San Miguel Corp B. 
Anscor-Hagedorn Securities vice-president Noel Reyes said the market will likely correct on Friday due to end of the month book squaring . 
&quot; It was rather a flat market today and it will be the same for the next trading days . 
there &apos;s the Hong Kong handover and end of the month or first half cleaning of books . 
we expect the market to take a breather , &quot; said Manuel Goseco , analyst at Dharmala Securities .
