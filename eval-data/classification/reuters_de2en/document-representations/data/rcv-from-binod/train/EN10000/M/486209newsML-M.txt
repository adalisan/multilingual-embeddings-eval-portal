Morgan Stanley Capital International ( MSCI ) said on Thursday the Singapore equity market was the worst performer in Asia in March , followed by Hong Kong and Malaysia . 
the MSCI Far East Index fell 4.0 percent in March as all six developed countries in the region declined , the company said in a report . 
Singapore investors were negative on the upcoming release of the country &apos;s economic data , MSCI said . 
Hong Kong suffered from concerns over U.S.-drivened interest rates impact on the local property market , the impending takeover by China and the diversion of investor attention to red chips from blue chips . 
red chips are Hong Kong-based companies with financial backing from China listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange . 
Malaysia was dragged lower by disappointing earnings of several Malaysian conglomerates and thin trading as investors awaited the central bank &apos;s annual report . 
in contrast to the weaker Far East index , MSCI Europe Index rose 3.1 percent in March . 
there , the top performers were Germany , Switzerland and Sweden , the report said . 
it said the tightening of U.S. monetary policy did not affect investor sentiment in Germany as the higher interest rates were already reflected in the stock prices . 
Swiss stocks surged on strong earnings reports in the food sector and strength in banking while in Sweden , investors were encouraged by the U.S. market &apos;s initially calm reaction to the rate hike , the report said . 
in March , the best performers in the emerging markets were Greece , Portugal and Peru while India , the Czech Republic and Russia led the worst performers . 
India was weighed by a lack of foreign funds while the Czech Republic was dampened by caution over a slowdown in 1997 economic growth , the report said .
