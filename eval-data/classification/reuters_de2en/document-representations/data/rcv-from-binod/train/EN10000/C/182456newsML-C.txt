All-cargo airline Polar Air cargo is to take delivery of its first Boeing 747-200F series aircraft at Hong Kong &apos;s Kai tak airport on December 13 , an airline statement said . 
the handover of the aircraft fresh from a &apos; C &apos; check at Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company brings the number of B747s in the Polar fleet to 14 , it added . 
the carrier &apos;s chief executive officier , NED Wallace said in the statement that Polar &apos;s fleet will increase by two to three 747 &apos;s each year over the next five years . 
the next 747-200F is scheduled for delivery in first quarter 1997 , he added . 
industry observers say Polar has a reputation for being a low cost airline using first generation former passenger 747 aircraft converted to carry around 100 tons of cargo . 
the U.S. based carrier said it is anticipating a &quot; significant jump &quot; in its Asian operations if the U.S. Department of Transportation finalises a &quot; tentative &quot; decision awarding Polar the new U.S.-Japan all-cargo route . 
polar said the Department of Transportation &apos;s favourable evaluation was partly due to its proposal to increase using anchorage , Alaska as a hub to trans-load traffic between Asia , South America , Europe and the U.S. 
&quot; The final award of the Japan route will mark the culmination of a three year strategy by Polar to create an effective global network of operations . 
as we extend our geographic reach , we enhance our competitiveness by giving our customers the market access and route flexibility they need , &quot; Wallace added .
