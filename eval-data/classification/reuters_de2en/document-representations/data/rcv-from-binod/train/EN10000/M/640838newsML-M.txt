U.S. treasuries opened slightly lower on Thursday ahead of the government &apos;s weekly report on new jobless claims . 
the Labor Department is expected to report at 0830 EDT / 1230 GMT that new claims for state unemployment benefits edged down to 320,000 in the week ended May 31 from 322,000 in the previous week . 
but analysts said prices are likely to remain rangebound during the session as participants await the more influential monthly employment report due on Friday . 
at the open , the 30-year bond was at 96-21 / 32 , down 3 / 32 from Wednesday &apos;s close , its yield at 6.89 percent . 
at the shorter end of the maturity curve , two-year notes were trading at 100-2 / 32 , yielding 6.22 percent . 
analysts said position-squaring before the May employment report due Friday would characterize Thursday &apos;s session . 
technical factors and the belief that the May employment data will not be very negative for the credit markets have been lending support to the market over the last week and would continue to do so on Thursday , analysts said . 
on the September T-bond contract , support was cited at 109-24 , with resistance at 110-09 . 
while the market is cautious about selling off before the Friday payroll report , analysts said there were also some signs of selling on strength . 
analysts at mms International noted &quot; some swap activity &quot; in five- and 10-year maturities . 
six-month bill rates opened at 5.21 percent , up three basis points . 
year bill rates opened at 5.47 percent , up two basis points . 
Matthew Alexy , chief markets strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston , said the prices were unlikely to move decisively ahead of the May employment numbers . 
&quot; We &apos;re going to be pretty tight , &quot; said Alexy . 
&quot; The ( monthly ) chain store sales data are very , very weak . 
so the fundamentals are looking good for the market . 
but you have to get the employment report out of the way . 
&quot; The problem is that everyone is expecting a fairly friendly report and so the risk now is that the data would be less friendly than expected , &quot; Alexy said . 
among large retail companies reporting sales , Wal-Mart same-stores sales were up 3.6 percent , K-Mart said its May sales rose 2.1 percent and sears , Roebuck said its May domestic same-store sales fell 1.2 percent . 
the government will issue the May retail sales report next week on June 12 . 
those data will be examined closely by the market since policy makers are said to be carefully watching consumer demand trends .
