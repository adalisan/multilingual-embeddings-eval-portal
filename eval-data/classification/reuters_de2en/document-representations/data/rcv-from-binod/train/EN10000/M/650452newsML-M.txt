Italian debt markets twitched up into positive territory at the close but traders said this was on short covering in a highly-strung market . 
confusion and nervousness over where European monetary union is heading has rendered the BTP market thin and flighty as investors opt to deal only when the herd does in order to be sure of liquidity . 
otherwise they &apos;re keeping out . 
&quot; They either trade all together or they remain quiet and the market isn &apos;t so liquid , &quot; one broker in London said . 
buoyancy in Spanish markets had allowed the Btps to stay up but brokers were sceptical as to how solid Italian bonds were . 
the September BTP future on LIFFE was 41 basis points higher at 129.88 having dipped close to support at 129.00 earlier . 
&quot; A break there would be a bad signal , &quot; the broker said . 
the February 2007 BTP ended 34 basis points up at 97.30 with the yield 7.26 percent and the spread over the benchmark Bund 149 basis points . 
a broker at a U.S. bank in London said the strength of mark / lira , compared with weakness of the mark outside Europe , was a hint the Italian currency would draw the weight of investor fears first if there were signs of EMU delay . 
&quot; There &apos;s a general liquidation of positions , &quot; the broker said . 
but investors were not actively going short on Italy at the moment and the market was still relatively long despite position unwinding . 
domestic Italian investors were optimistically braving the EMU squall believing EMU would go ahead without delay and , moreover , banking on fall in domestic inflation , brokers said . 
UK investors were the heaviest weight at the Euro sceptic end of the scale , brokers said . 
EMU concerns are the only real stimulus moving the bond market currently . 
&quot; We &apos;ll move only on the back of a change in the EMU scenario , &quot; a broker said .
