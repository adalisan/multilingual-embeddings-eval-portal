Austrian shares ended over 1,200 points on Monday for the first time since early February 1994 , but traders said they expected some consolidation before the index was established above that important psychological mark . 
the ATX index of 21 blue chips jumped 5.0 points , or 0.42 PCT , to 1,201.96 . 
among its constituents 13 ATX shares rose , seven fell and one was unchanged . 
technical analysts saw the index in a range between 1,186 and 1,205 over the next few days . 
some traders were sceptical that the gains could be sustained . 
&quot; When you only get a rise without volumes , it &apos;s not a good sign , &quot; one trader said . 
but others were more optimistic . 
&quot; It looks as though we &apos;ll stabilise above 1,200 , &quot; one said , noting that although turnover was below average , demand remained strong in individual shares . 
&quot; It &apos;s not particularly bullish , but there is no pressure in the market at the moment , &quot; he added . 
he forecast the market would trade between 1,200 and 1,220 points in the near term . 
the top gainer of the session was microchip maker AMS , climbing 4.26 percent to 126 schillings .
