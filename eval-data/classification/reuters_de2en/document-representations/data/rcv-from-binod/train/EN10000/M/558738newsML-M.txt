wall Street investors may turn their attention this week to lagging small cap stocks after the Dow industrials posted a record weekly gain and investors cheered a budget deal in Washington . 
analysts say that last week &apos;s rally began to extend beyond the handful of first-tier large capitalization names that have driven the averages higher . 
the search for value appears to be moving into new territory . 
&quot; A lot of investors feel that the only areas with reasonable value are small and mid-cap issues and some cyclicals , &quot; said Michael Metz , chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co . &quot; The reason is the full exploitation of those stocks which figure prominently in the indexes and the sense that it is a folly to chase them at these levels . 
the stock market rounded out a strong week with the Dow barreling ahead 94.72 points to 7071.20 . 
for the week , it gained 332.33 points , a record weekly rise . 
the move in small caps , which have languished since the start of the year , is a welcome one , broadening the base of a previously narrow rally , analysts said . 
this year through last Friday , the Dow industrials were up 9.7 percent . 
but the Nasdaq composite index has risen a mere 1.1 percent , while the Russell 2000 has fallen 2.4 percent . 
the numbers include impressive gains by the two smaller-cap indexes on Friday . 
the Nasdaq composite posted a record single-day point gain , rising 34.83 points , or 2.7 percent , to 1305.33 . 
the Russell 2000 small cap index jumped 8.32 points , or 2.4 percent , to 353.98 . 
wall Street could get some further fuel from investor enthusiasm for a deal on a framework for a balanced budget by 2002 , announced by President Clinton and the Republican-led Congress late Friday . 
&quot; This is something that ( Federal Reserve Chairman Alan ) Greenspan has wanted for a long time and has said would help keep interest rates down , &quot; said Anthony O &apos;Bryan , technical analyst at A.G. Edwards &amp; sons . 
analysts said there could be some profit-taking in large cap stocks this week . 
&quot; The market is overpriced , &quot; said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. &quot; We could see a decline in large cap stock indexes such as the Dow and the S &amp; P 500 , but an improving relative performance by smaller cap issues as measured by the Russell 2000 . 
but tensions about what action Fed chairman Greenspan will take on interest rates when the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets on May 20 should become less pressing this week . 
&quot; The economic numbers ( last week ) relieved some of the urgency in the Fed &apos;s need to raise interest rates quickly , although they don &apos;t eliminate the risk of another rate increase , &quot; said Peter Canelo , chief investment strategist at Dean Witter . 
Canelo said that the economy is strong enough to absorb more rate increases , and he believes that the market may be overly concerned about the effect of a couple of monetary tightenings on the economy or corporate earnings . 
&quot; Some people believe that a quarter point rise would slow the economy , but I don &apos;t buy that , &quot; he said . 
&quot; A quarter point is meaningless from a corporate point of view , it &apos;s not relevant . 
he said that the economy could &quot; live with one or two rate increases , but three or four more monetary tightenings would be a different story .
