with first new-crop arrivals due by June , Pakistan cotton prices will remain pressured by more than a million 375-lb bales of unsold stock , analysts said on Wednesday . 
&quot; ginners plan to start up their factories in southern Pakistan by the end of June , &quot; Khushi Ram , a broker at the private Karachi Cotton Association ( KCA ) , said . 
ram , who is also a cotton grower and ginner , said the glut of stocks held by ginneries would keep prices in check for the rest of the 1996 / 97 ( July-June ) crop year and beyond . 
&quot; I have sold 2,000 bales of the new crop at 2,250 rupees ( $ 55.94 ) per maund ( 37.32 kg ) for delivery by the end of June or the first week of July , &quot; Ram said . 
&quot; Any taxes , including sales tax , will have to be paid by the buyer . 
prices of NIAB-78 variety closed at 2,278.50 rupees per maund , including 10 percent sales tax , on Tuesday at the KCA . 
ram said it was too early to predict the size of the 1997 / 98 crop but it would be higher than 1996 / 97 output estimated at 8.7 million bales . 
with domestic cotton prices relatively high , cotton offered growers better returns than sugarcane . 
former KCA chairman Maqbool Sadiq said the area to be sown could yield 11 million bales &quot; if the weather remains friendly &quot; . 
farmers had hoped to produce 12 million bales in 1996 / 97 but pest and insect attack after floods in Punjab province kept the crop to 8.7 million , against initial official estimates of 10 million , Sadiq said . 
the government later revised its estimates to 9.2 million bales and ultimately to 8.7 million . 
ram said cotton sowing in Sindh province was to be completed next month . 
sowing had also started in Punjab , which produces more than 75 percent of the country &apos;s cotton . 
&quot; Cotton prices will not be bullish in 1997 / 98 due to the carryover stocks of more than one million bales , &quot; Ram said . 
the state-run Cotton Export Corporation of Pakistan said output had reached 8.623 million bales by March 20 compared to 9.844 million in the same period a year ago . 
textile mills had purchased 7.137 million bales by March 20 compared to 7.613 million a year earlier . 
exporters had bought a paltry 5,700 bales by March 20 , compared to 1.4 million a year ago . 
some 1.48 million bales remained at ginneries . 
former KCA vice-chairman Amir Merchant said output would meet textile mill needs of about 8.6 million bales in 1996 / 97 . 
he attributed the plunge in exports to higher local prices . 
KCA secretary Fasihuddin ( one name ) said exporters had shipped only 15,720 bales between September 1 and December 31 , compared to 541,000 in the year-ago period .
