more than 100 students protested in the northeastern city of Kisangani in the newly-declared Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday , shouting &quot; Tutsis go home &quot; , aid workers said . 
they said the students said they were protesting against what they said was the killing of a fellow student on Tuesday by a soldier of the victorious Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo ( AFDL ) . 
it was one of the first signs of popular opposition in a major city to Tutsi Alliance fighters . 
the alliance includes Banyamulenge Tutsis from the east of the country and some Tutsis from Rwanda . 
&quot; Leave the Congolese people in peace . 
Tutsis go home , &quot; a foreign aid worker quoted the protesting students as shouting . 
&quot; They protested by riding bicycles in the city carrying tree branches with other students marching behind them singing . 
it was peaceful and there were no clashes with alliance forces , &quot; he told Reuters by telephone . 
&quot; There were over 100 . 
at one point they were seen throwing stones to halt vehicles as they went to fetch the body of the student they said had been killed by a rebel soldier , &quot; he added . 
a U.N. airlift of Rwandan Hutu refugees from Kisangani to Rwanda was suspended for Wednesday because of the disturbances but aid agencies were not targeted by the students , he added . 
the Tutsi-dominated rebel alliance seized the capital Kinshasa on Saturday , a day after president Mobutu Sese Seko relinquished power and left the city . 
it took most of the country in a lightning seven-month offensive from the east .
