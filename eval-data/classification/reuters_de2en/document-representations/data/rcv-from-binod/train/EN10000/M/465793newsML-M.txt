the Prague Stock Exchange lost ground for the fourth consecutive session on Tuesday , as blue chips stagnate while foreign investors wait on the sidelines in fear of a U.S. interest rate hike . 
eight of the bourse &apos;s 10 largest issues fell , pushing the PX50 index down 2.7 points , or 0.49 percent , to 550.5 , while the Reuters RPIX index closed down 10.4 points at 1,141.8 . 
dealers said blue chips such as SPT Telecom , CEZ and Komercni Banka -- which account for some 45 percent -- are extremely sensitive to the mood of foreign investors , who normally account for around half the trading in the two shares . 
&quot; The story remains the same , there is no new money coming in . 
everybody is waiting for what will happen in the U.S. , &quot; Jan Sykora of Wood and Company told Reuters . 
overall , 192 issues rose on the day , while 185 fell and 173 held steady . 
a total of 1.05 million shares changed hands on turnover of 910.7 million crowns . 
markets across the region have been eagerly awaiting a meeting of the U.S. Federal Open Markets Committee on Tuesday due to widespread speculation that U.S. interest rates may be raised .
