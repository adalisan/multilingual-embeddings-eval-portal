a military court in Jordan sentenced a soldier to life imprisonment with hard labour on Saturday for killing seven Israeli schoolgirls in March . 
the five-man panel of military judges said the soldier , Ahmed Daqamsa , was guilty of murder but said his crime was not premeditated . 
&quot; The council finds that the circumstances of premeditation do not exist because it is clear that the accused suffers from a personality disorder , with a quick temper which he could not control , &quot; tribunal head Brigadier Mamoun Khasawneh announced . 
military prosecutors had told the court during the two-month trial that Daqamsa plotted to kill Israelis for years and carefully planned his attack . 
but defence lawyers said Daqamsa was a pious man with a mental disorder , who was provoked by the girls while he was praying .
