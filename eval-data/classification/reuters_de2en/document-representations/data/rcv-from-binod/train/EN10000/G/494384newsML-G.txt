foreign ministers of more than 100 nations of the Non-Aligned Movement ( Nam ) said on Tuesday an enlargement of the U.N. Security Council should not discriminate between rich and poor countries . 
a Nam panel also called for a special session of the U.N. General Assembly on the Middle East , which figured prominently at the meeting &apos;s opening on Monday attended by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat . 
&quot; There shall be no partial or selective expansion or enlargement of the membership of the Security Council to the detriment of developing countries , &quot; the ministers said in a declaration adopted on the second day of the two-day meeting . 
the ministers also sought to eliminate the veto power of the permanent members of the council -- the United States , Britain , France , China and Russia -- as part of the move to reform the United Nations . 
an Indian diplomat said the wording was aimed at discouraging a pending proposal from the General Assembly president , Ismail Razali , that could see Japan and Germany included as permanent members in an expanded Security Council . 
the meeting of the 113-nation movement , widely considered irrelevant by critics after the end of the Cold War , received a boost from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan , who backed efforts for U.N. reforms in the inauguration he attended on Monday . 
in a forceful address , Arafat attacked Israel for its recent attempts to build 6,500 homes in Palestinian territory captured in 1967 , violating a Middle East peace accord . 
peace talks were halted after Israel began work last month on the new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem , sparking daily clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops . 
the ministers spent most of their time in closed-door sessions working towards an intended Delhi Declaration , a larger document focusing on U.N. reforms and the demand for the elimination of nuclear weapons within a set timeframe . 
last year , eight Nam members refused to endorse a global treaty to ban nuclear test blasts , seeking to link it to the timebound elimination of all nuclear weapons . 
India conducted a nuclear test in 1974 but says it has no plans to build an atomic bomb . 
Western experts say it already has or can assemble one quickly . 
the Delhi Declaration was scheduled to be adopted later on Tuesday . 
&quot; The use of the veto should be curtailed with a view to its eventual elimination , &quot; the declaration on U.N. reform said . 
the Razali proposal , made earlier this year in New York , aims to complete a restructuring of the council by February , 1998 . 
India , which has lobbied for a permanent seat on the Security Council , is among leading Nam members who feel it is biased by veto powers that often run against the wishes of the General Assembly , where all members are equal .
