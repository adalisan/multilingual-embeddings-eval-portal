sterling took a hammering on Tuesday as expectations of a near-term rise in British interest rates faded in the wake of an apparent softening of the Bank of England &apos;s hawkish stance on inflation . 
&quot; People are reassessing the interest rate outlook and deciding that rates are almost certainly not going to rise ahead of the general election , and perhaps not even going up this year as far as people have expected , &quot; said Jonathan Loynes , UK economist at HSBC Markets . 
on Monday Bank of England governor Eddie George said a spate of economic data alongside sterling &apos;s strength had made the need for an interest rate rise less urgent than was thought in December . 
the comment made the move in sterling one-way traffic all through the day , making it nose-dive four pfennigs against the mark and two cents against the dollar . 
the pound was at 2.7110 marks , down from its day &apos;s high of 2.7535 and its late Monday European level of 2.7451 . 
it was at $ 1.5995 against a high of $ 1.6175 and Monday &apos;s level of $ 1.6171 . 
George denied his comment was a softening of the central bank &apos;s line but said it was possible that strong sterling could push underlying inflation down to the government &apos;s 2.5 percent target in the months ahead . 
the underlying rate stood at 3.1 percent on a year-on-year basis in January . 
but the market did see George &apos;s comment as a softening of his previously hard line on rates , which since the last base rate rise -- 0.25 percent to 6.00 last October -- have been strongly resisted by Finance Minister Kenneth Clarke . 
political considerations have stayed Clarke &apos;s hand on a politically unpopular monetary tightening ahead of the forthcoming election , which is widely expected to be held on May 1 , analysts said . 
with sterling having crashed through some strong support levels on its way on Tuesday , traders saw it slipping further , or at least having a struggle to rise back up again . 
&quot; It looked like 2.7400 marks would provide some support but it didn &apos;t hold . 
so that may prove to be a bit of an obstacle coming back up , and there may be some selling on rallies , &quot; said one trader at a British bank . 
some analysts said data showing the British public sector &apos;s borrowing situation was better than expected also added to sterling &apos;s weakness . 
January public sector debt repayment was 5.818 billion sterling , higher than forecasts of 3.5 billion . 
January cumulative public sector borrowing requirements were 10.342 billion sterling against 19.336 billion a year ago . 
UK Chancellor Kenneth Clarke , lauding the data as &quot; excellent &quot; , said Britain was comfortably on the track to achieving its budget forecast for public finances , adding that it may do even better than forecast . 
&quot; Sterling &apos;s weakness today in part reflects the spectacularly good PSBR data and the perception that fiscal policy was a bit tighter than people had thought , as that releases some of the pressure for higher interest rates , &quot; said Adam Cole , UK economist at HSBC James Capel . 
meanwhile , the market had discounted the victory by Britain &apos;s ruling Conservative Party late on Monday on a censure motion over the government &apos;s management of the mad cow disease crisis .
