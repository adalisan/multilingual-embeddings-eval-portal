Japan &apos;s trade surplus with Asia fell for the first time in nine years in 1996 on the back of strong import growth and a shift of Japanese manufacturing to less-expensive countries in the region . 
analysts said the trend will continue , even though a 50 percent drop in the yen since April 1995 has reduced the incentive for Japanese companies to move production abroad . 
Japan &apos;s merchandise surplus with Asia fell 15.7 percent in 1996 from a year earlier to 5.56 trillion yen ( $ 46.7 billion ) , the first time it has shown a decrease in nine years , the Ministry of Finance ( MOF ) said on Thursday . 
a ministry official said the fall was due to a surge in imports while exports were up modestly . 
imports jumped 22.9 percent from 1995 to 13.96 trillion yen ( $ 117 billion ) while exports to the area edged up 8.7 percent to 19.52 trillion yen ( $ 164 billion ) from a year ago . 
&quot; Most of the imports seem to be made up of so-called &apos; reverse-imports &apos; , imports to Japan from the factories of Japanese companies in Asia , &quot; said George Ikeshita , assistant director at the overseas research division of the Japan External Trade Organisation ( JETRO ) . 
Japanese manufacturers have been moving their production facilities abroad , many of them to Asia , in the last few years to cut labour costs and tackle the sharp rise of the yen , which had made their exports unattractive . 
the number of colour television sets imported to Japan has surpassed that of exports since 1992 , data by the Electronic Industries Association of Japan showed . 
analysts said the trend to move production overseas seems to be undeterred by the steady weakening of the yen , which has once again made Japanese exports price-competitive and lessened the need to shift factories abroad . 
after hitting a record high of 79.75 to the dollar in April of 1995 , the yen has steadily followed a downward path , falling to about 119 to the dollar on Thursday , a 47-month low . 
&quot; Despite the recent depreciation of the yen , Japanese companies will continue to use their overseas factories to export to countries other than Japan , &quot; said JETRO &apos;s Ikeshita . 
analysts said many Japanese manufacturers intended to stick to their plan of shifting production abroad and to set up factories within the region to which it intends to export so as to avoid future fluctuations in exchange rates . 
such moves will work to keep a lid on exports out of Japan , thereby making any sharp rises in Tokyo &apos;s future overall trade surplus unlikely , they added .
