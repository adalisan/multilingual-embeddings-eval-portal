the won closed slightly lower on looming importer deals amid short dollar positions in the market , dealers said on Monday . 
they said the record high monthly trade deficit in August caused some dollar buying interest . 
hit by plunging semiconductor prices , South Korea &apos;s trade shortfall widened to $ 2.9 billion from a $ 901 million deficit a year ago . 
&quot; But dealers could not be aggressive buyers due to fears of a central bank selling intervention , &quot; said a local bank dealer . 
the won closed at 819.50 after opening at 819.30 . 
it fluctuated between 819.60 and 818.80 . 
dealers said the market was still short on dollars despite the weekend exporter negotiations . 
the market remained quiet in general ahead of tomorrow &apos;s announcement of government economic policies by Finance and Economic Minister Han Seung-soo , they said . 
&quot; Many banks are waiting for the announcement , just squaring their positions . 
the economic policies will decide the future dollar direction , &quot; said a Citibank dealer . 
dealers forecast the dollar would drift sideways between 819 and 820 won on Tuesday . 
tomorrow &apos;s mid-rate is expected to be pegged at 819.30 / 40 against 819.40 today .
