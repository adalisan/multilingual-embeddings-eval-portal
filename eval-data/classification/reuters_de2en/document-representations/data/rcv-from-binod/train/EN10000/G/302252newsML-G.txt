clay court specialist Carlos Moya thanked German Boris Becker on Monday for some free advice which helped the young Spaniard oust the defending Australian Open champion in a stunning first-round victory . 
Moya , 20 , who was just learning to play the game when Becker turned professional in 1983 , said the six-times grand slam champion suggested last year that he hone his hardcourt game . 
&quot; Coming from him , it is good advice because he &apos;s been one of the greatest players in history . 
I grew up watching him on the TV and it &apos;s nice for me that he said that , &quot; Moya told reporters after the match , played in sizzling centre court heat . 
&quot; That helped me because I realised that I can ... become a good player on hardcourt , and this is one of my goals for this year . 
now is too early to know if I can prove that . 
back in October , after Moya upset Becker in the second round of the Paris Open indoors , the German in effect wrote his own epitaph by urging the young promising Spaniard to play more hardcourt matches . 
&quot; He has top 10 potential , but if he wants to progress he should not just play on clay for 10 months . 
he has to go to a hardcourt season and play indoors more often , &quot; Becker said . 
now ranked 25th in the world , Moya described his Paris win over Becker as &quot; more than a victory &quot; because his opponent , a veteran of 14 seasons on the tour , was a childhood hero . 
armed with a lethal forehand , a lightning return of serve and a beautifully-weighted lob , the Spaniard again outplayed Becker on Monday winning 5-7 7-6 3-6 6-1 6-4 -- this time on the same rebound Ace surface where Becker triumphed a year ago . 
Moya has yet to survive the second round of a grand slam but his climb up the ranking over the past 12 months has been rapid . 
ranked 63 at the end of 1995 , the long-haired Spaniard raced into the top 20 with 43 tournament wins , claiming such prized scalps as Becker , world number three Goran Ivanesevic and the &quot; King of clay &quot; himself , 1995 French Open champion Thomas muster . 
&quot; I can beat anybody on any kind of surface , &quot; said Moya , a U2 fan whose long hair and grunge outfit of baggy shorts and bandana helped make him an instant favourite with the young fans in Melbourne Park &apos;s centre court crowd . 
youth was clearly on Moya &apos;s side against Becker , whose legs began to wilt as the match entered its fourth hour and the court temperature climbed past 30 degrees Celsius . 
&quot; Nobody can beat Boris when he &apos;s playing 100 percent . 
I was sure at least ( I could ) fight the match and put pressure on him , and also the weather was the key to the match , &quot; Moya said .
