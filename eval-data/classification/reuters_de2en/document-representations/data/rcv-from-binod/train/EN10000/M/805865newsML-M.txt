the Dow Jones industrial average rebounded strongly Monday as bargain hunters resurfaced after the high drama of Friday &apos;s near-record market plunge . 
based on early and unofficial data , the Dow stormed 108.70 points higher , or 1.4 percent , to 7,803.36 , regaining a large chunk of the 247-point loss Friday , which was the second biggest point drop since the 1987 crash . 
in the broader market , declining issues led advances by a narrow margin on active volume of 517 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
analysts said the market raced higher as investors sought an entry point after Friday &apos;s plunge on concern that future corporate earnings growth may slow . 
but many investors were still unsure of the market &apos;s short-term direction , which accounted for the extreme volatility . 
wall Street was also trying to anticipate the outcome of Tuesday &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee meeting on interest rates . 
&quot; This was a very good first step &quot; after Friday &apos;s losses , said Brad Weekes , managing director of equity trading at Donaldson , Lufkin Jenrette &amp; Co . 
despite the big drop in the Dow , some money managers saw little sign of assets being reallocated in investment portfolios . 
&quot; We have not seen any and we don &apos;t intend to make any , &quot; said James Walline , vice president , equities and mutual funds at Lutheran Brotherhood . 
&quot; The market has stabilized this morning and frankly we don &apos;t see any reason to reallocate . 
among the big movers , Hewlett-Packard Co. fell 2-1 / 2 to 63-13 / 16 after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly results .
