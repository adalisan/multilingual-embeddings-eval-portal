following is the text of a statement issued by the Irish Republican Army claiming responsibility for Monday &apos;s bombing of the British army base at Lisburn . 
&quot; Volunteers of Oglaigh na hEireann ( the IRA ) planted two 800 pound ( 360 kg ) bombs that detonated within the confines of the headquarters of the British occupying forces in Ireland yesterday . 
&quot; The target was personnel connected with the Thiepval barracks and we regret any injuries caused to civilians . 
&quot; Contrary to media speculation that this action was designed to provoke loyalist paramilitaries , this action should be viewed in the context of our statement of February 9 , announcing the end of the 18-month complete cessation of military operations . 
&quot; As we outlined on that occasion , we called the cessation to enhance the democratic peace process . 
the British Government responded by squandering that historic opportunity in a vain attempt to defeat the IRA . 
&quot; The resolution of the conflict demands an inclusive negotiated settlement . 
this is not possible unless and until the British Government faces up to its responsibilities . 
&quot; The blame for the failure thus far of the Irish peace initiative lies squarely with John Major and his Government .
