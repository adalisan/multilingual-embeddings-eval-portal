Israeli share prices greeted the new year with a powerful rally and while most analysts say the rise looks sustainable , the broad investing public has yet to join in the celebration . 
&quot; The market is sick of being in a slump , &quot; said Joanthan Ross , a vice president at Nesuah Securities . 
&quot; There is an awful lot of money ready to invest -- money in short-term shekel deposits . 
that money -- estimated at 100 billion shekels ( $ 30.8 billion ) accumulated as the public bailed out of equities over the last three years -- has yet to find its way into stocks . 
nevertheless , the Mishtanim index of 100 leading shares rose 8.9 percent in the first five trading days of the year as trading volume rocketed to nearly 200 million shekels a day , more than three times its level in October . 
along the way the Maof index of blue chips easily shot through what Ross called the &quot; iron ceiling &quot; technical barrier of 223-224 points . 
in fact , the 1997 rally began in the last two months of 1996 , but it gained momentum accompanied by a big increase in turnover this year . 
analysts say that after such big gains , Israeli shares are now due for a correction . 
&quot; I would argue that the market needs a small correction before it can go on to a bigger rise , &quot; said Roger Hornett of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull Securities in London . 
he said the correction would be about three to four percent . 
Ross said he did not see the Maof falling below its old ceiling . 
for now the market has shrugged off political problems -- the impasse in talks between Israel and the Palestinians over a Hebron redeployment and the upsurge in clashes between Israeli troops and Islamic militants in Lebanon . 
over the longer term , analysts warned , further deterioration in the Middle East peace process could undermine the market . 
Israel &apos;s economy has begun slowing from its fast-paced growth of 1990-95 but Hornett said the market &apos;s positive factors outweigh those issues . 
Israeli stocks are trading at about 13 times prospective 1997 earnings , versus 17-18 times in comparable international markets , he said . 
Societe Generale is forecasting 20 percent real earnings growth for traded companies this year . 
Hornett expects economic growth to pick up this year . 
he said Israel &apos;s gross domestic product expanded four percent in 1996 ( less than the government &apos;s preliminary estimate of 4.4 percent ) but that it will rise to 4.5 percent this year . 
he expressed satisfaction with the government &apos;s budget-cutting programme for 1997 . 
but more important is that short-term interest rates will gradually come down at about 20-30 basis points a month from the current base rate of 14.7 percent . 
the market has its eye set on the 100 billion shekels of cash held by the Israeli public , but analysts say that for now the rally is being driven by a much narrower class of investors . 
Eyal Kokla , of Sigma Securities , said mutual funds , the main investment vehicle for small investors , have been the major buyers . 
but he said portfolio managers and insurance companies have been providing the liquidity by buying units . 
&quot; It &apos;s certainly not the public returning to the bourse , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I think you have a good deal of participation by those who never left the market .... What you &apos;re seeing now is a lot of asset shifting , &quot; said Ross . 
a small number of buyers have had an outsize influence because the market has a comparatively small float and lacks liquidity . 
&quot; The market is not only reacting to positive sentiment but to the lack of liquidity , &quot; Ross said , warning : &quot; If foreigners come to the market ( in large numbers ) , we won &apos;t have enough shares to sell them . 
analysts said it is only a matter of time before the public returns . 
with interest rates heading lower and the property market in a slump , said Hornett , stocks are irresistable . 
&quot; It &apos;s the only asset class that will go up , &quot; he said .
