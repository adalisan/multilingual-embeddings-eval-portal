South Korea &apos;s former health minister has been cleared of suspicion of bribery , but his wife was arrested on corruption charges on Thursday , a prosecution official said . 
Lee Sung-ho , minister for health and welfare , was questioned for more than six hours by prosecutors on Wednesday after the presidential Blue House announced his resignation . 
&quot; The former minister was allowed to return home late last night because he had been cleared of suspicion in the scandal , &quot; said Park Joo-sun , a senior prosecutor at the Seoul District Prosecutor &apos;s Office . 
Lee &apos;s wife , Park Sung-ae , was arrested on charges of accepting a total of 170 million won ( $ 205,000 ) handed to her on three occasions between July and October last year from the head of an opticians &apos; trade group , Park said . 
Kim Tae-ok , president of the Korean Optometrics Association , was also arrested on charges of paying money to Park , he said . 
the association was seeking changes in the law to give its members a monopoly over the sale of spectacle frames . 
park Sung-ae issued a promissory note to Kim in March worth about 150 million won to repay most of the debt , but it was not honoured , the prosecutor said . 
President Kim Young-sam said he felt &quot; bitter over this incident &quot; , according to a Blue House statement on Wednesday . 
&quot; In the future I will not condone anybody who is linked to corruption , regardless of whether their title is high or low , &quot; President Kim was quoted as saying . 
Lee was the second cabinet minister to leave office under a corruption cloud in less than a month , severely embarrassing the president , whose campaign to root out corruption has brought to justice former presidents Roh Tae-woo and chun Doo Hwan . 
last month Kim sacked his defence minister , Lee Yang-ho , who was formally charged on Monday with accepting bribes and leaking state secrets . 
a third cabinet official , Foreign Minister Gong Ro-myung , stepped down on November 5 citing health reasons .
