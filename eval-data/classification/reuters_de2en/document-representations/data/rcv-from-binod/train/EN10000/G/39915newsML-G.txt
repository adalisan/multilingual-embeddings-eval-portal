French centre-right politicians were divided on Sunday on a bombshell suggestion by Prime Minister Alain Juppe for electoral law reforms which could mean big gains for extreme rightist Jean-Marie Le Pen . 
the proposed changes would re-introduce some proportional representation into elections . 
the main -- and probably intended -- effect would be that the opposition Socialists would lose dozens of seats to junior partners on the left , political analysts say . 
but it would also mean the likely election to the 577-seat National Assembly of up to 40 members from Le Pen &apos;s stridently-xenophobic National Front ( FN ) they believe . 
&quot; We have joint responsibility for the future of France and ( that ) means each side should be equally associated in conceiving and preparing political projects , &quot; said Education Minister Francois Bayrou in thinly-veiled criticism of Juppe . 
the reform is mostly aimed at staving off possible defeat of pro-government parties by opposition Socialists in general elections in 20 months &apos; time . 
opinion polls suggest Gaullist President Jacques Chirac &apos;s failure to live up to election-time promises of cutting unemployment and improving daily life will give the opposition a strong boost at the polls . 
Juppe &apos;s intended electoral law changes , since confirmed by aides , were disclosed on Friday by the newspaper Le Monde , apparently before allies of his neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic ( RPR ) party were informed . 
Bayrou is from the centre-right Union for French Democracy ( UDF ) party , before which Juppe made a call for unity in this French Atlantic resort on Saturday . 
the UDF is junior partner in the conservative cabinet led by the RPR from whose ranks both Chirac and Juppe emerged . 
but both Bayrou on Sunday and UDF president Francois Leotard the previous day made clear they were lukewarm towards the idea of changing electoral laws primarily to save the RPR from defeat at the polls . 
culture Minister Jacques Toubon , a Juppe loyalist , said the reform would introduce a measure of fairness into French politics where minority views were shut out of parliament . 
French Jewish leader Henri Hajdenberg , to whose community Le Pen is anathema , slammed the reform suggestion , saying : &quot; Who will believe the change has any goal other than to preserve their ( RPR ) interests even if those who will benefit will be the National Front ? 
we are fiercely opposed . 
under the current system , a candidate must win more than half the votes in the first round to be elected outright to the assembly . 
otherwise the two top candidates go on to a run-off . 
the system allows for deals between mainstream left-wing and right-wing parties , especially beneficial to the Socialists , but it shuts out the FN , shunned by mainstream politicians . 
the FN failed to win a single seat in the last national elections in 1993 , despite winning 12.5 percent of the popular vote . 
the party , which wants to expel foreigners from France , is now credited with around 15 percent of voting intentions .
