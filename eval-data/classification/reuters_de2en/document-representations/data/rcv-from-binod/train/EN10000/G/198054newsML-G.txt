Richard Court &apos;s calling a general election last week simply gave the federal government and the states the excuse to call off the Council of Australian Governments ( COAG ) meeting that none of them seemed to want in the first place . 
at the same time , the cancellation of the second COAG meeting under John Howard &apos;s government throws the whole reform process into doubt , particuarly in the light of the prime minister &apos;s comments last week after Jeff Kennett had handed over Victoria &apos;s industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth . 
&quot; pragmatic federalism is when you take opportunities as they come along to remove waste and overlap rather than the pie-in-the-sky , airy-fairy federalism which first seeks to put in place an overall grand plan and a framework and doesn &apos;t do anything to fix up things when they can be fied up until you &apos;ve got the grand plan in place , &quot; Howard said . 
&quot; This ... industrial relations area represents more progress than has been achieve in many other areas without fanfare , without rhetoric , because people have sat down and negotiated in an intelligent , pragmatic fashion , &quot; he said . 
if it is it &apos;s a gloomy outlook for the concept of regular meetings of the state and territory leaders with the prime minister aimed at reforming who does what and where the money comes from . 
Howard -- the man who once said &quot; I &apos;m the most conservative leader the Liberal Party &apos;s ever had &quot; -- carries that conservatism thhrough to reform of federalism . 
he would much prefer to sit down with one premier at a time , as he did with Kennett a week ago , to achieve reform piece by piece . 
the last premiers &apos; Conference proper serves as a cautionary tale for Howad . 
remember the Commonwealth put up its plan involving the end of sales tax exemptions for states , worth about A $ 1.2 billion . 
treasurer Peter Costello was pretty smug about the idea , briefly , until Jeff Kennett took over . 
Kennett led the revolt which overturned the Commonwealth package and unprecedentedly , replaced it with the states &apos; own plan under which they agreed to forgo grants worth $ 2 billion . 
the experience would have demonstrated to the states they don &apos;t have to automatically fall in behind the Commonwealth ; that with a united front , a half-way decent alternative can get up . 
Howard &apos;s main concern is tax and the states &apos; share of it . 
the states are adamant that they won &apos;t accept any of Howard &apos;s reforms , which concentrate on devolving functions back tothe states , until they have a fixed share of tax revenue so they have certainty in funding . 
the premiers fear they &apos;ll take over responsibility for key areas like health and housing and then find the money hasn &apos;t come as part of the package , or that the funding has been sharply diminished . 
not entirely disconnected from the issue is that the premiers &apos; call for tax reform . 
once again , led by Kennett , they recently formed a united front to press the Commonwealth on that front . 
for tax reform , read indirect tax reform , i.e. 
a broad-based consumption tax . 
Howard has nothing to say on this subject expect that he &apos;s not budging on his pledge that a GST or other form of consumption tax is off the agenda this parliamentary term . 
over and over again . 
work is going on within the government on how it will deal with this issue as the next election draws closer . 
the recent tax summit which saw broad agreement between business and welfare groups on the need for tax reform was a sign that that strategy was nearing its use-by date . 
but the cancellation of this COAG meeting to make way for the Western Australian election doesn &apos;t suit those outside the process . 
the health system has to be restructured before next June when the current Medicare agreement expires and as far as the industry is concerned the sooner further progress is made the better . 
aged care , which is seen as one of the models for handing responsibilities to the states , is worrying the industry and those in care . 
a federal government paper prepared for the cancelled COAG meeting argues the reform will offer strong benefits in the long term , but it acknowledges it will &quot; take some adjustment in the short-term . 
and the shake-up of housing funding to a system of cash payments to public housing tenants has has this sector concerned about the difficulties of application throughout the country . 
final word on the reform is probably a year away at this pace . 
so the premiers might have avoided an argument or three with the Commonwealth this time round but they can &apos;t be put off forever . 
and Howard might not be a natural reformer , but some of the processes have already gone too far to simply ignore .
