Suzie Wong has straightened out her life and is studying for a business degree . 
as capitalist Hong Kong prepares for a new dawn under communist China , she is being consigned to history along with the rickshaw , the pigtailed coolie and the opium den . 
the little harbour hotel where she plied her trade with American sailors has been replaced by a marble skyscraper and the waterfront has retreated under force of reclamation . 
Suzie &apos;s place in the girlie bars of Hong Kong &apos;s Wanchai district has been taken by Mimi from Manila , a surly 20-year-old , and Doi from Bangkok , who is worried about the immigration police . 
&quot; No money , no talk ! 
&quot; the bargirl &apos;s cry immortalised in Richard Mason &apos;s 1950s classic , &quot; The World of Suzie Wong &quot; , has become a more threatening , and far more desperate : &quot; You buy me one more ladies &apos; drink ! 
Suzie would be 60 if she was still around today . 
a few relics from her era in the brothel-bar of the Luk Kwok Hotel survive in the trade as hard-bitten mama-sans . 
they crouch on low stools outside neon-lit entrances to clubs with names like superstar and Waikiki , springing up to tug at the sleeves of passing tourists and businessmen , who have replaced sailors as the area &apos;s best customers . 
&quot; Ai Ya ! 
&quot; exclaimed the 40-something topless barmaid in the crazy Horse , the one Chinese face among a dozen or so Filipinas working behind the bar and dancing in leotards on stage . 
&quot; Hong Kong girls don &apos;t like to do this work . 
they like to go to college and study business . 
the truth is that Wanchai &apos;s sex-for-sale bars are now grim , half-empty shelters for lonely expatriates and the odd sailor on a shore pass . 
and they &apos;re expensive , too . 
these days it would cost Robert Lomax , the English hero of &quot; The World of Suzie Wong &quot; , US $ 500 or more to pay Suzie &apos;s &quot; take-out &quot; fee and escort her to a hotel room for an hour or so of &quot; jig-a-jig &quot; . 
a couple of beers and enough ladies &apos; drinks to keep the peace could easily set him back $ 100 . 
budget brothels are now clustered together across Victoria Harbour in seedy tenements that line Temple Street in Mongkok . 
here Mrs Wang , a recent immigrant from Beijing , delivers a bruising massage and -- for those too battered , or too drunk , to resist -- a furtive &quot; special &quot; on a padded bench in the everlasting Virtue sauna Palace . 
Mrs Wang is a former factory hand , hates communism and its regulated drudgery and is proud to announce that in her new line of work among the whorehouses of Kowloon &quot; I can earn more in one month than in one year in Beijing &quot; . 
&quot; There &apos;s nowhere in the world like Hong Kong , &quot; she enthuses . 
many of the Mongkok prostitutes have been smugled in from China by &quot; snakeheads &quot; , the Triad gang-controlled smugglers who shuttle girls and contraband by speedboat into quiet bays in the remote New Territories . 
prices of these mainland hookers are openly displayed on yellow neon signs , ranked in order of age , skin tone and beauty . 
while Suzie Wong &apos;s life had a happy ending -- a fresh start with Lomax in Japan -- the illegal immigrants are often snared in police raids and bussed home across the border . 
back in Wanchai , the Luk Kwok hotel has long been demolished . 
a glittering glass-and-marble replacement now bears its name , but Suzie would never have got past the security guards hovering by the high-speed elevators . 
the old Star ferry , where Lomax first spotted Suzie in pigtails splitting melon seeds with her teeth , still plies the harbour , although its berth in Wanchai is now on reclaimed land far from the bars . 
double-decker trams still clang through the district . 
but the rickshaw pullers who once padded barefoot along Lockhart Road have given way to red Toyota taxis , yellow minibuses and , below ground , the Mass Transit Railway . 
&quot; Like every other business in Hong Kong -- and this is undoubtedly one of the biggest -- the sex industry caters for every pocket , &quot; writes Kate Whitehead in her new book , &quot; After Suzie &quot; , co-authored with Nurie Vittachi . 
&quot; And it &apos;s tax free .
