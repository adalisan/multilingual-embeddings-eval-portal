Taiwan &apos;s foreign exchange reserves edged up to an initial estimate of US $ 86.3 billion at the end of August from $ 86.124 billion at the end of July , the Economic Daily News said on Monday . 
the independent newspaper attributed the small rise to changes in foreign exchange rates . 
a central bank spokesman refused to comment , saying the bank was scheduled to release the official figure on September 25 . 
Taiwan &apos;s foreign exchange reserves , the world &apos;s third largest after Japan and China , fell in late 1995 and early 1996 as political tensions with rival China intensified into a military crisis in March , triggering heavy capital outflows . 
the trend reversed after Taiwan &apos;s March 23 presidential election and the start of a clear easing of tensions with China , with reserves rising slowing since April . 
Beijing , determined to thwart any moves toward Taiwan &apos;s independence , held war games and missile tests in the Taiwan Strait in the run-up to the presidential poll , triggering waves of U.S. dollar buying and a run on gold . 
the central bank intervened during the crisis to support the Taiwan dollar and the island &apos;s hypersensitive stock market . 
Taiwan &apos;s foreign reserves peaked one year ago at $ 100.412 billion in June 1995 .
