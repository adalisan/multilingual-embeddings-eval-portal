Canadian shares will shrug off the gloom expected to hit U.S. equity markets and post nearly double-digit increases during 1997 , a Reuters survey of world stock markets shows . 
seven analysts studying Canadian equities who took part in the poll made an average prediction of 6,470 points for the benchmark TSE 300 index at the end of next year . 
compared with Monday &apos;s close in Toronto of 5,906 , this represents an increase of 9.5 percent , and stands in sharp contrast to expectations for south of the border where U.S. stocks are expected to fall around six percent . 
not all of those polled were optimists -- there is also a view that the Canadian market will follow Wall Street into a bear trend . 
following are a selection of views on next year &apos;s performance of Canadian stocks : 
&quot; We &apos;re in a general long-term up-trend . 
the stock market is still going to be the best place to invest , given the relatively low interest rates . 
&quot; We will start inching up , but even if we do get two or three interest rate hikes in the first couple of quarters next year -- which I think is going to cause a correction in the markets -- it &apos;s not going to put bonds or bills at a competitive-enough level . 
&quot; The inevitable increase in rates has got to happen sometime within the next 12 months , and that will test the markets . 
&quot; ING predicts a decline to 5,750 points by the close of 1997 and further to 5,400 a year later . 
&quot; I think the Toronto Stock Exchange is in the middle of a bull market . 
&quot; He said foreign investors would flood to Canada &apos;s market as it would be seen providing better value than the United States . 
&quot; A lot of market watchers , myself included , think the U.S. market is over-stretched .
