more than a year before the next Winter Olympic Games in Japan , one loser is already counting the off-the-slopes cost . 
no medal loss is involved . 
instead , it is the end of a century of tradition and a livelihood that supported generations of residents in this tiny mountain railway stop . 
the casualty is Yokokawa &apos;s &quot; bento &quot; , or box lunch which , in a nation where trains are the most popular form of travel , has been a national best-seller . 
railway stations across the nation vie with each other to sell box lunches packed with all the creativity and local specialities a region can muster , and Yokokawa was a leader . 
even Emperor Akihito was unable to resist its bento . 
when he was crown prince , he asked for the Yokokawa &quot; kamameshi &quot; when travelling between Tokyo and the imperial family &apos;s summer residence in the nearby mountains of Nagano , site of the February 1998 Winter Olympics . 
the Yokokawa lunch is not unique . 
it consists of stewed meat , vegetables and herbs on a bed of rice , a combination often found in Japanese box lunches . 
what sets it apart is the container -- an earthenware pot which , with &quot; Yokokawa &quot; glazed on it in calligraphy , is a cherished souvenir for any Japanese . 
the stampede to buy a &quot; kamameshi &quot; during the three-minute stop at Yokokawa started when a small company called Oginoya started selling lunches on the station platform 111 years ago . 
but next year the tradition ends because of the introduction of a non-stop , high-speed Shinkansen bullet train to connect Tokyo to Nagano in time for the Olympics . 
the Shinkansen line will bypass Yokokawa , so the station &apos;s &quot; kamameshi &quot; sellers will lose their customers . 
the only trains stopping there will be short-distance locals whose passengers are not interested in buying box lunches for their journey . 
but I guess we have to go with the flow of the times , &quot; said Teruo Nara , 62 , who after 42 years of selling on Yokokawa &apos;s platforms is Oginoya &apos;s longest-serving employee . 
&quot; It &apos;s heartbreaking when the customers ask you , as they buy their lunches , what &apos;s going to happen to this tradition , &quot; said Tadashi Tamura , a kamameshi seller for a mere 37 years . 
&quot; People come from all over Japan to buy our kamameshi at Yokokawa . 
yes , we do sell them at some drive-ins , but that &apos;s not the point , &quot; said Ryosuke Tanaka , Oginoya general manager . 
&quot; Selling lunches on the station platform is what we &apos;ve been doing for more than a hundred years , and it &apos;s the image , the tradition , that matters to people , &quot; he said . 
Oginoya sells about five million kamameshis each year , in Yokokawa or drive-ins in the region . 
business is brisk year-round , with holidaymakers heading for Nagano &apos;s mountain resorts in the summer and its hot spas and ski slopes in the winter . 
&quot; buying the kamameshi here is a ritual . 
we &apos;ve been doing it every year for ages , &quot; said a 38-year-old woman riding on the train with her two children . 
but the fun part is the dash to get one and eating the kamameshi on the train , with the scenery going by and everything . 
it won &apos;t be the same , &quot; said a female college student . 
in a blur of hands , meal containers and money are exchanged witha deftness that would be the envy of the fastest supermarket checkout clerk . 
the kamameshi sellers rarely , if at all , leave a customer unserved before the train departs . 
the kamameshi sellers -- about four or five of them are on the platform at any given time -- have a special thank-you ritual for customers . 
with an easy grace born of long practice , they sweep their caps off their heads and bow deeply towards the passengers on the train as it pulls out of the station . 
next autumn , it will all end .
