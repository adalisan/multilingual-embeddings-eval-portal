diplomatic sources in Havana on Tuesday denied a report from Madrid that unidentified assailants vandalised the house of the Spanish consul in the Cuban capital on Monday night . 
but the sources said that robbers entered the garden of consul Eduardo Cerro last week while he was away on a trip and stole a television antenna . 
in Madrid , a Spanish Foreign Ministry official said that the consul &apos;s house was attacked on Monday night and the attackers punctured the tyres of his car and stole a television antenna . 
amid shortages in Cuba , it is common for Havana thieves to steal items from gardens , ranging from light bulbs to garden furniture . 
Cerro lives in the Miramar district , where many foreign diplomats reside . 
there was no official comment from the Cuban government or the Spanish embassy on the incident , which took place at a time of tension between Spain and Cuba . 
a row erupted a week ago when Cuba withdrew approval for a new Spanish ambassador , accusing Spain of interfering in its affairs . 
but in recent days both Madrid and Havana have sought to ease tensions . 
after the Cuban protest , Spanish authorities asked Cuba to step up security around the embassy in Havana .
