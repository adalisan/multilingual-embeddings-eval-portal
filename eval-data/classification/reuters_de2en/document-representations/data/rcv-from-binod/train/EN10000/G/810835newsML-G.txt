Syrian President Hafez al-Assad reiterated at the end of a visit to Iran that he would never compromise on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights , the state Iranian news agency IRNA said . 
IRNA said Assad made his comments on Friday night during talks with Iran &apos;s President-elect Mohammad Khatami and before flying back to Damascus at the end of his second visit to Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution . 
&quot; Assad said the Golan Heights is an integral part of Syria and no matter how strong the enemy or his supporters are , Syria will not bend to any pressure and will continue pursuing its objectives decisively , &quot; IRNA quoted Assad as saying . 
&quot; He pointed out that growing American support for Israel is a clear demonstration of its policy that it pays little significance either to the Arabs or to the Moslems around the world , &quot; the agency added . 
Khatami , who is due to take office on Monday , said Israel &apos;s &quot; claim to peace ... is just a mirage and a baseless concept and it has no good intention in regard to such initiatives &quot; . 
&quot; Khatami then pointed out that the objective of the United States is to create a strong and a powerful Israel having an upper hand over the Arabs in the region , &quot; IRNA said . 
Syria &apos;s talks with the previous Israeli government had made little progress since peace negotiations began in 1991 -- and were suspended by Israel shortly before the victory of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s Likud party in May 1996 elections . 
but the new Israeli leader &apos;s rejection of the principle of trading occupied Arab land for peace , including Syria &apos;s Golan Heights occupied by Israel since 1967 , appeared to close off prospects of fresh negotiations . 
Israel &apos;s proposal for talks without conditions -- meaning no commitment to discuss return of the Golan -- has been rejected . 
IRNA said Assad left the Iranian capital on Friday night and was seen off by President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani . 
&quot; We reached the conclusion that the two countries &apos; viewpoints in all fields are common , &quot; IRNA quoted Assad as saying at Tehran airport . 
he said his talks &quot; showed that the essence of our intentions are identical , only expressed in different words . 
Iran &apos;s spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , in a meeting with Assad on Friday , urged Arab states to &quot; correct &quot; their policy towards Israel and accused the United States of playing a dishonest role in the Middle East . 
Iran and Israel have been bitter enemies since the Islamic revolution . 
Iran says Israel has no right to exist and has been vehemently opposed to the Middle East peace process . 
Washington , a key player in the peace process , has demanded that non-Arab Tehran end its objections to the peace moves and halt alleged support to militant groups who target Israelis .
