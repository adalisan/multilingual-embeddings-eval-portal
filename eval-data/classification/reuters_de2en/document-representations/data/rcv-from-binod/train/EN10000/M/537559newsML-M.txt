Indonesian buyers are seeking between 20,000-50,000 tonnes of corn and over 50,000 tonnes of soymeal after recently buying a Panamax-sized cargo of Argentine corn for July shipment , dealers said on Thursday . 
&quot; I heard the Indonesians are looking for Argentine or U.S. corn for June / July shipment , &quot; one trader for a U.S. firm said , adding the quantity could reach 50,000 tonnes . 
another dealer said Indonesian buyers were &quot; checking prices on and off . 
they have not covered their positions up to that point so I think they may be in for 50,000 tonnes ( of corn ) . 
Indonesia is also said to be hunting for about 50,000 tonnes of soymeal for late June shipment , traders said . 
&quot; They want 50,000 tonnes or slightly more , &quot; one said . 
traders said the Indonesians were probably given a slight discount for the Argentine corn they bought . 
the only other buyer seen in the market is Thai Vegetable Oil , which is said to be close to clinching a deal for 50,000 tonnes of soybeans for June shipment from Brazil , dealers said . 
Malaysia , on the other hand , is said to need about 20,000 tonnes of soymeal , but is in no hurry to buy because it has put on ample coverage . 
Thailand may also pick up 20,000 tonnes of soymeal in the next few weeks , the traders added . 
dealers said an attractive option for buyers would be Argentine or Brazilian soymeal , which is being quoted by the trade at a discount against U.S. origins and seen at around $ 315- $ 325 a tonne C &amp; F on a handy vessel for June / July shipment . 
&quot; Some of the buyers are putting off their purchases for late June or early July because they think prices will come off sharply by then , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; They also feel they can use other substitutes , especially for soymeal . 
the rest of the grains and oilseeds market in the region remained quiet , with some dealers saying the Chinese were still making offers for corn although there were no takers . 
&quot; There &apos;s nothing substantial really going on at the moment . 
people are just very well-covered , &quot; one trader said . 
Chinese corn was quoted by the trade at around $ 145- $ 148 a tonne C &amp; F Southeast Asia on a handy for June / July shipment . 
Chinese and Argentine origins maintained their discount to U.S. corn , which was seen by dealers here at about $ 149- $ 152 a tonne C &amp; F on a Panamax for June / July shipment . 
the trade is also waiting for clearer signals from Thailand &apos;s Commerce Ministry on rules for the duty-free importation of 200,000 tonnes of corn . 
&quot; What we understand is that buyers there have not received the green light to import . 
that &apos;s what they &apos;re waiting for , &quot; a trader said . 
&apos; That &apos;s why the market is so slow , &quot; one trader said .
