sugar traders in Hong Kong confirmed on Wednesday that China imported up to 80,000 tonnes of sugar in December , but said no new import quotas were being issued . 
&quot; We have actually sold about 40,000 tonnes of Australian sugar in December to China when the price was a bit better , &quot; said a sugar trader . 
&quot; others have also imported some sugar , in total about 80,000 tonnes , but I really think that 80,000 is the maximum they could buy , &quot; the trader said . 
another source said he knew of 14,000 tonnes of sugar , most likely from Australia , sold to China for December delivery . 
no further details were available . 
a China-based sugar source said last month that rumours of cargoes totalling about 50,000 tonnes arriving in China in December had weighed on domestic prices . 
domestic white sugar prices ex-Guangxi , China &apos;s main producing area , continued their downward slide and were heard on Wednesday at 3,800-3,850 yuan ( US $ 458-463 ) per tonne , compared with 3,950 yuan ( $ 476 ) per tonne in the third week of December . 
China &apos;s ban on sugar imports not destined for processing and re-export would be extended through 1997 , the Economic Information Daily said in December , quoting an official from the State Planning Commission . 
sugar traders said no new import quotas were being issued , but were divided on whether this would boost prices . 
&quot; The market price will be getting to around 4,000 yuan ( $ 482 ) around Chinese New Year ( February 6-9 ) , &quot; said one Guangxi-based factory source by telephone . 
others were less sanguine , noting that although sugar prices normally recovered after the lunar New Year , in 1996 the situation had reversed and prices slid right into the summer . 
the current narrowing gap between domestic and international prices made imports unprofitable anyway , traders said . 
&quot; Even today if the imports were allowed , compared to the world price and after ( Chinese ) taxes , it &apos;s very difficult to earn money , &quot; a senior Hong Kong trader said . 
China &apos;s import tariff and value-added tax on sugar added up to 30.7 percent to the prices , the trader said . 
Japanese traders said the sugar market in the Far East remained fairly quiet this week following the New Year holidays . 
premiums for January / March delivery were quoted at 0.75 / 0.80 cents ( bid / offer ) per pound over New York &apos;s Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange on an fob basis . 
March / May deliveries were quoted at 0.45 / 0.55 cents on the New York exchange , they said . 
in Japan , Nissho Iwai reiterated on Wednesday its sugar shipments from Cuba were not delayed . 
&quot; There &apos;s no problem about the Cuban sugar shipment . 
new crop is being shipped from late December , &quot; a Nissho Iwai trader said . 
a Nissho Iwai vessel , the Pichai Samut , arriving at a Thai port to load 18,000 tonnes of sugar to Japan was unconnected to the Cuban sugar sitation , the trader said . 
Japanese traders were watching for possible fallout from the unexpected removal of the president of Cubazucar , Cuba &apos;s state sugar trading firm . 
&quot; This was a surprise for us , too . 
but we &apos;d like to see possible impact , &quot; a Japanese trader at another firm said . 
China has yet to sign the annual government-to-government agreement with Cuba on sugar imports , Hong Kong traders said . 
they expect the amount to be lower than the estimated 360,000 tonnes imported from Cuba for 1996 .
