stone-throwing students at the University of Panama clashed with riot police on Wednesday during a demonstration to demand the return of leftist student leaders suspended earlier this year on vandalism charges . 
the demonstration involved 300 students at the country &apos;s largest university and left at least five people injured . 
there were no immediate reports of any arrests . 
red Cross officials said they treated two students for minor shoulder and head wounds sustained when police shot rubber bullets at the demonstrators . 
protesters inflicted minor lacerations on three police officers , police said . 
the students , many covering their faces with cloth to disguise their identity , blocked traffic along Simon Bolivar Avenue , one of Panama City &apos;s main thoroughfares that runs in front of the university .
