the Hong Kong stock market gave Britain a warm sendoff but China a rousing welcome as the blue-chip Hang Seng Index scored a record close and red chips soared on the last day of trade under British rule on Friday . 
traders on the stock exchange floor cheered as the closing bell rang for the last time under British rule leaving the Hang Seng Index at an all-time closing high of 15,196.79 points , up 68.77 points , or 0.45 percent . 
the index came just shy of its record intra-day peak of 15,322.33 points , rising to an early high of 15,275.54 . 
but its gains paled in comparison to so-called red chip stocks -- Hong Kong-based companies with Chinese financial backing -- which were bid sharply higher ahead of a new era under China . 
the Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporations Index surged 224.63 points , or 6.92 percent , to 3,469.32 , its biggest point gain since it was launched on June 16 . 
&quot; turnover was high and sentiment was strong , &quot; said Howard Gorges , vice chairman at South China Holdings . 
&quot; The day was really made by the red-chip stocks . 
the Hang Seng Index does not really tell you the whole story now with the red chips dominating trading now , &quot; he said . 
Hong Kong returns to Chinese rule at midnight ( 1600 GMT ) on Monday after 156 years of colonial rule . 
less than two hours after the market closed on Friday the office of Hong Kong &apos;s future leader Tung Chee-hwa announced that China would send 4,000 troops into Hong Kong on the first day of Chinese rule . 
but brokers &apos; optimism was unshaken and they expected the market to move higher next week when it reopens on Thursday following a three-day holiday to mark the handover . 
&quot; Investors are not going to be nervous . 
after all , what are we going to become , China right ? 
&quot; said Kent Rossiter , institutional sales manager at Nikko Securities . 
among the big gainers on Friday were China &apos;s new powerhouses which are expected to see a bright future under Chinese rule . 
&quot; Very interestingly it is the red chips which have had a very , very strong day and the more traditional blue chips were lagging , &quot; said Richard Verin , head of equities trading at CS First Boston . 
&quot; Behind the facade of the market -- in a way you can look at it as the old market -- there were some very big movers today . 
Shanghai Industrial Holdings Ltd , an investment arm of the Shanghai municipal government , and China Resources Enterprise Ltd , controlled by China &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation , are expected to become major players in Hong Kong . 
Hong Kong &apos;s stock market regulator , the Securities and futures Commission , said on Friday that it would treat all listed companies in Hong Kong the same way after the handover . 
&quot; They will be regulated to the full , according to Hong Kong rules . 
and it matters not whether it &apos;s a red chip company , blue chip company or a black chip company or whatever . 
everybody will get the same treatment from us , &quot; SFC chairman Anthony Neoh said . 
property stocks limited the Hang Seng Index &apos;s gains on Friday , with investors nervous ahead of an expected announcement soon after the handover of the new government &apos;s housing policy . 
the U.S. Federal Reserve is also due to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday while the market is closed for the handover holiday . 
but brokers said stocks should push higher next week , with the return to Chinese rule ushering in a flow of mainland money . 
&quot; The market will open stronger I think on Thursday because people will want the first day of trading under a new government to be successful . 
I think the market will be pushed up higher , &quot; said Miles Remington , sales trader at SocGen-Crosby Securities .
