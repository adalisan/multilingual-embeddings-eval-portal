the Bank of Israel on Tuesday announced a 0.3 percentage point reduction in its key lending rate for October but the business sector said a sharper cut was needed to put the economy back on track . 
the rate cut , the third in as many months , will bring the key lending rate to an annualised 15.5 percent . 
Israeli banks followed suit , lowering the prime rate to 17.0 percent . 
the Bank of Israel attributed its decision to the low consumer price indices in the past two months and a rate of expansion in money supply that is in line with expected growth . 
Dan Propper , president of the Manufacturers Association , and Danny Gillerman , head of the Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce , said at least another two percentage points should be cut . 
Propper said in a statement that the high level of interest rates could lead the economy to the &quot; brink of a crisis &quot; and he called for a programme that would include a substantial interest rate reduction , a correction in the strong shekel and a cut in the government &apos;s budget . 
the stock market also demonstrated disappointment in the rate cut and traders said only sharp gains in two leading shares prevented the benchmark Mishtanim index from falling . 
it closed up a mild 0.66 percent at 197.31 . 
Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel said interest rates have declined by a sharp 1.5 percentage points since August . 
he argued that a steeper cut would not be prudent given that the capital market &apos;s inflationary expectations for the coming 12 months and forecasts for inflation in 1996 are above the government &apos;s target of 8-10 percent for this year . 
private sector forecasts put 1996 inflation at 11 to 12 percent . 
&quot; It looks now that during 1996 inflation will exceed the level set by the government , &quot; Frenkel told Reuters . 
&quot; I believe a more significant reduction in interest rates would have been irresponsible . 
it would have fueled inflation and would not contribute to the profitability of the business sector . 
Frenkel said the biggest problem facing Israel was the widening current account deficit in its balance of payments . 
&quot; The only effective way to deal with this gap is by cutting government expenditures , &quot; Frenkel said . 
Parliament must still approve the 4.9 billion shekel cut in the 1997 budget sought by the new government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . 
Frenkel urged parliament to vote quickly on the budget and said the government should seek additional ways to cut spending .
