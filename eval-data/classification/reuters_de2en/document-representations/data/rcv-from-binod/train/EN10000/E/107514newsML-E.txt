the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said its Chicago Fed Midwest Manufacturing Index ( CFMMI ) posted a solid 0.4 percentage point gain in August to register a reading of 129.4 . 
&quot; The CFMMI &apos;s increase in August was the result of broad-based strength , unlike the July gain of 0.3 percent that was led by a solid 2.3 percent increase in the auto sector , &quot; said a report issued by the Chicago Fed . 
the broad-based strength reflected in the CFMMI was attributed to &quot; a more moderate gain &quot; in the auto sector than posted in July , even though seasonally-adjusted auto assemblies slumped from an exceptionally high July level . 
in addition , The Chicago Fed said steel and machinery activity rebounded during August after declining in July . 
averaging only about half the growth of May and June , CFMMI growth in July and August expanded at a &quot; markedly slower pace , &quot; according to the report . 
&quot; Should this pattern continue in September , third-quarter gains in the CFMMI will slow down noticeably from the second quarter pace , &quot; the report added .
