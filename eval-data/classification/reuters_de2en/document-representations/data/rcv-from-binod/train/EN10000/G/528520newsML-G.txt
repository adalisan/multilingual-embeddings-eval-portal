NATO &apos;s military chiefs failed on Tuesday to agree the share-out of posts and commands within a streamlined alliance adapted to take account of the realities of the post-Cold War world . 
NATO sources said the alliance &apos;s 16 Chiefs of Defence staffs found broad agreement on the need to reduce the number of regional commands in Europe from three to two , but failed to make any progress on what to do at the lower level . 
&quot; They are encountering more difficulties than had been anticipated a few weeks ago , &quot; said one NATO diplomat after a full day of negotiations at NATO &apos;s Brussels headquarters . 
the military chiefs were expected to return to some of the outstanding problems over dinner in the hope they could find more common ground before handing the dossier over to defence ministers to take the final decisions . 
&quot; Clearly the factors at play are no longer military , but political . 
at the end of the day , you will have to have a balance between the two , only defence ministers can do that , &quot; said a senior military official . 
the proposals on the table aim to reduce NATO &apos;s Cold War defence posture from four command levels to three . 
in addition , a new streamlined network of sub-regional commands , each capable of limited out-of-area operations , would report to two rather than three regional commands -- one in northern Europe and one in southern Europe . 
the reforms are considered essential if the alliance is to be able to take on more Bosnia-style operations , cope with the influx of new members from former communist Europe , and find ways to make savings . 
overall , the current package would move the alliance from 65 headquarters at four command levels to 25 at three levels . 
but the crucial questions of where to situate the new commands and with what level of staffing have yet to be resolved . 
&quot; We have to avoid a proliferation of costly headquarters and strike a balance between north and south , &quot; added the official . 
Britain , which is set to lose a central European zone command headquarters , has said it will not back the proposals if other countries are not seen to be making sacrifices at a lower level of command . 
&quot; London is saying it will not fall on the sword unless others are also willing to make savings . 
we must avoid a proliferation of regional commands which eliminate savings we make from cuts higher up , &quot; said one alliance military source . 
Britain , supported by Canada , is pushing for a package of financial and man-power limits in exchange for losing a prestigious regional command . 
NATO , created to defend the West from a huge attack from the Soviet Union which never happened , has traditionally adopted a defensive posture which leaves it ill-placed for &quot; out-of-theatre &quot; Bosnia-style peacekeeping operations . 
the plans are designed to allow smaller groups of NATO members , often working with non-NATO countries , to take part in security operations on the continent which do not need the huge back-up and fire-power of the Cold War military alliance . 
in the south , Greece , Turkey , Italy , Spain and Portugal all want a command on their territory . 
&quot; The problem is the military say we only need two , and we have not been able so far to agree anything below four , &quot; added the diplomat .
