Polish shares set a 33-month high for the second straight session in heavy turnover on Thursday and analysts expected them to extend gains thanks to likely foreign institutional buying . 
the main market &apos;s WIG index rose 1.1 percent , to 15,249.3 , and turnover fell 5.4 percent to 189.7 million zlotys ( $ 65.4 million ) on both markets as a total of 49 issues rose , 15 fell and 20 were flat . 
&quot; We &apos;ve really got the impetus and it &apos;s a good sign that the demand is generated by foreign funds , which we can tell from the turnover figure and demand on large-caps , &quot; said Czeslaw Pospieszynski , an analyst at Bank Gdanski brokerage . 
some analysts said strong resistance for the WIG index would be 16,000 points , but others saw the index soaring to 18,000 points in the next two months . 
some said new issues at the turn of the month , which were likely to amount to about 200 million zlotys ( $ 67 million ) , could slow the expected growth and make the index stabilise . 
they said much would depend on companies &apos; December and preliminary 1996 earnings reports due next week . 
they said Thursday &apos;s top gainer industrial boiler-maker Rafako SA surged 9.7 percent after it said on Wednesday it sought a strategic investor . 
continuous trade turnover amounted to 18.4 million zlotys ( $ 6.3 million ) with nine stocks falling , six rising and five staying flat . 
mass privatisation NFI units rose 2.8 PCT in 17.4-million- zloty ( $ 6 million ) trade and were up one percent in 26.7- million-zloty ( $ 9.2 million ) continuous trade .
