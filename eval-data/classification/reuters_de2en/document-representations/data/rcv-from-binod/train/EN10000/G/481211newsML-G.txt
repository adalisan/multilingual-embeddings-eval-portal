French President Jacques Chirac arrived on Wednesday for a two-day state visit to the Czech Republic during which he is expected to make clear his support for early Czech membership of NATO and the European Union . 
Chirac , who was greeted at Prague airport by Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec , was due to meet President Vaclav Havel later on Wednesday and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus on Thursday before making a speech to both chambers of parliament . 
French officials have said Chirac will tell the Czechs he wants them to be members of the European Union by 2000 . 
he has made similar statements to Hungary and Poland , who are seen as the other leading contenders to be the next new members of the EU and NATO . 
Czech officials have expressed concern at French insistence that NATO must reach a new security arrangement with Russia before inviting new members to join . 
Havel told the French daily Le Monde this week that the West could not allow its attitude to be dictated by Moscow . 
Prague is the latest stop on a tour of East European capitals by Chirac who has previously visited Warsaw , Bucharest and Budapest .
