Renat Akchurin , the doctor chosen to carry out the planned bypass operation on Yeltsin said on Sunday that the 65-year-old leader could wait another 1-1 / 2 to two months and might have to resign himself to not having it . 
&quot; Everything is going down on this news ... 
even the ( investment ) funds , known as the least nervous and who have bought MinFins long ago , are selling , &quot; Imperial Bank dealer Alexei Denisov said . 
dealers said selling was more active on the Western side , with local operators following the general trend . 
they said it was difficult to forecast how long the fall would continue . 
&quot; It will all depend on what else they or maybe Yeltsin himself says , if they do after all , &quot; one dealer said .
