Market-supportive comments by outgoing finance minister Ruiari Quinn and a firming of the Irish pound against the mark provided a positive backdrop for unusually high volumes of trade in Irish bonds on Wednesday , dealers said . 
&quot; We opened weak but gained as the market digested Quinn &apos;s assertion that we &apos;d have zero EBR this year , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; We lost those gains later in the session but there has been very firm foreign and domestic buying throughout , with steady switch trade along the curve . 
the Irish pound &apos;s gains against the mark had added to the firm backdrop , the dealer added . 
&quot; The punt has had a good day against the mark - trading at around 2.62 and proving quite resilient at the lower levels - and that has reassured the market . 
by 1510 GMT , the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was down five pence at 102.10 to yield 5.92 percent , while the eight percent bond due 2006 was up two pence at 110.07 to yield 6.50 percent . 
yields against German Bunds widened slightly from Tuesday &apos;s close at 159 basis points over in the five-year bond , and 92 over in the 10-year . 
dealers said comments in the press by the outgoing finance minister that Ireland &apos;s capital borrowing would be covered by a current account surplus , resulting in a balanced budget for 1997 , had been supportive of the market . 
&quot; Whether Quinn is correct or not , the market took it as positive , &quot; a dealer said . 
all eyes would be on next week &apos;s exchequer returns , dealers said , which are likely to show a large budget surplus at mid-year and highlight that there will be limited issuance of fresh stock over the balance of the year . 
the new Fianna Fail-Progressive Democrat government is set to take office on Thursday . 
dealers are particularly interested in what how the incoming finance minister - tipped as FF spokesman on finance Charlie McCreevy - will tackle the issue of currency . 
the weak Irish pound has been causing Irish bonds to underperform against Spain and Italy over recent weeks , dealers said .
