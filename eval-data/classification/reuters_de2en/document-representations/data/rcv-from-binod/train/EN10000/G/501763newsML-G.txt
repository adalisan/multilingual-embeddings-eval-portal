eleven Greeks died from using high-grade heroin in the past week while the number of drug users in Greece was rapidly increasing , government officials said on Thursday . 
police said the high-grade heroin had been on the market for the past month and if used with alcohol or sleeping pills could be fatal . 
the health ministry announced on Wednesday that it was setting up three new centres in Athens and the northern port of Salonika to provide users with methadone as a substitute for heroin . 
it will also set up a a special ambulance service to treat emergency cases relating to drug use . 
&quot; The increased number of heroin-related deaths , drug infiltration in schools and low age of drug users are a cause for alarm and indicate that drug abuse in Greece is growing steadily , &quot; Health Minister Costas Gitonas said . 
he said that in 1987 there were 56 drug-related deaths , reaching 176 in 1996 , while turnover from the drug trade was estimated at around $ 2 billion a year .
