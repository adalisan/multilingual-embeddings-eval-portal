a Turkish fan fell to his death as he tried to adjust a television aerial for a perfect picture of Wednesday &apos;s European Champions &apos; League match between Fenerbahce and Manchester United . 
Nejdet Yavuzer , 38 , was killed when he fell from the roof of the five-storey apartment in the eastern town of Erzurum , the state-run Anatolian news agency said on Thursday . 
Soccer-related deaths are not uncommon in Turkey . 
heart attacks brought on by the excitement of big derby games and stray bullets fired by celebrating fans have taken their toll . 
last year , two people hanged themselves after their team narrowly lost a match . 
post-match fights with knives and sticks have also claimed lives .
