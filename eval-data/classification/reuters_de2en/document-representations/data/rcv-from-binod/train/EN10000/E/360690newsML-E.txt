Ireland &apos;s better-than-expected December credit growth data was flattered by exceptional factors which do not mean that the problem of strong Irish credit growth has gone away , analysts said on Thursday . 
&quot; The figures flatter to deceive , &quot; said Oliver Mangan , economist at Goodbody stockbrokers . 
the adjusted annual rate of private sector credit growth fell to 14.9 percent at end-December from a revised 16.5 percent , below market forecasts which ranged from 15-17 percent . 
but credit growth was reduced by the securitisiation of 200 million Irish pounds of mortgages which cut the growth in residential mortgage lending to 14.7 percent from 17.1 percent . 
the figures were also affected by the the ending of the payment of value-added-tax at the point of entry which meant payments amounting to 119 million Irish pounds which would have been due in December were deferred to January . 
analysts said that if these two exceptional factors were stripped out , the deceleration in private sector credit would have been less than the data suggested . 
&quot; If you allow for the mortgage securitisation and VAT receipts , the decleration in private sector credit is much more modest , from 16.5 to 16.1 percent , coming after a very substantial rise between October and November , &quot; Mangan said . 
when adjusted for special factors , the number was also much closer to the markets &apos; consensus estimates and remained well above the central bank &apos;s target , analysts said , and a strong number could be in the offing again in January . 
Padhraic Garvey , economist at Riada stockbrokers , noted the effect of the deferred VAT payments and recent reports of strong car sales and tax returns last month suggested that January &apos;s figure would be high . 
&quot; The strong credit growth story has not gone away , &quot; he said . 
analysts say , however , that the central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates in response . 
the strength of the Irish pound in the ERM grid and the expectation that Irish interest rates will converge toward German levels in the run-up to Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) make it difficult for the bank to raise rates by an amount sufficient to dampen demand , analysts say . 
&quot; The credit numbers are not going to have an effect on monetary policy although they will have some effect from time to time on market sentiment , &quot; said Jim O &apos;Leary , economist at Davy stockbrokers . 
o &apos;Leary believes Irish interest rates will remain unchanged until around mid-year , barring a major accident on the accident on the European stage . 
&quot; From then on , it might become interesting but only in terms of whether they &apos;ll fall and if so , by how much . 
I don &apos;t see a rise in interest rates on the cards at all in 1997 , &quot; he said . 
the Irish bond market , particularly the short end , responded positively on first seeing the numbers but later gave up most of its gains as analysts took a closer look at the data . 
&quot; There was some misinterpretation over the figures and the market came back again . 
broadly speaking , we are still up on back of them but they were not as good as initally perceived although credit growth did weaken from last month and that is positive for the market , &quot; one dealer said . 
the six percent five-year bond due 2001 was at 102.80 to yield 5.79 percent by 1745 GMT compared with 102.75 before the data after gaining 30 pence on its release .
