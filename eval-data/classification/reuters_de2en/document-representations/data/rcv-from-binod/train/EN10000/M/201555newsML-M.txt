the Chinese yuan closed down at 8.3005 against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday in very dull trade and the exchange is expected to take measures to encourage trading , traders said . 
the yuan opened slightly up at an intra-day high of 8.2995 from Monday &apos;s 8.2998 but fell to move around 8.3000 for most of the session , hitting a low of 8.3006 several minutes before the close . 
trading volume was very low , with most done at 8.3002 , traders said . 
&quot; Trading was very dull because most traders had little interest to buy or sell with the price moving in such a narrow range , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; The exchange is expected to take measures in order to make trading more active . 
dealers said that buying was less active than on Monday on concerns about selling by the People &apos;s Bank of China . 
&quot; Most people do not expect the yuan to stay above 8.3000 due to central bank intervention , &quot; said a second dealer . 
&quot; So they sold and pushed the yuan below the 8.3000 level again . 
dealers expect the yuan to consolidate around 8.3000 on Wednesday . 
the yuan closed slightly up at 7.4500 from 7.4600 against 100 Japanese yen and little changed at 1.0734 from 1.0735 against the Hong Kong dollar .
