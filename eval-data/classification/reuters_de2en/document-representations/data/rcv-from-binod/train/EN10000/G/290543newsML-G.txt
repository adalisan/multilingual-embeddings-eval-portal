Mali &apos;s former military leader Amadou Toumani Toure returned to the Central African Republic on Tuesday for his latest attempt to defuse the impoverished nation &apos;s third army mutiny in less than a year . 
Toumani Toure , nominated by four African heads of state who launched the mediation effort in December , met President Ange-Felix Patasse , Prime Minister Jean-Paul Ngoumpande and the French ambassador , sources close to the talks said . 
the army mutineers , who lost men and territory in a weekend of bloody clashes with French troops , are holding out for the release of prisoners , one political source said . 
French troops launched helicopter-led reprisal raids against rebel positions on Sunday , accusing rebels of gunning down two unarmed French officers on a mediation mission on Saturday . 
France put the death toll among the mutineers at 10 while the mutineers said 21 people were killed among their ranks plus 11 civilians . 
French troops detained several dozen mutineers . 
calm returned to the capital after the French intervention . 
witnesses said French troops flushed mutineers out of their main positions in all but the Kassai army camp . 
in the only new incident , witnesses said French soldiers on Monday shot dead a man in civilian clothes who fired at them . 
the revolts began in April over pay but have turned into a campaign to oust Patasse , a civilian elected in 1993 . 
French troops , in the former colony under a defence pact , intervened in May to keep Patasse in power during a second revolt . 
the third revolt began on November 16 . 
hundreds of people have been killed in the unrest .
