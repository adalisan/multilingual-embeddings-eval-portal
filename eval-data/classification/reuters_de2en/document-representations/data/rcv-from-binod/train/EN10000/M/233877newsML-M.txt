Mexican stocks closed down on Wednesday after what traders said was &quot; orderly &quot; profit-taking . 
&quot; It was just profit-taking , quite in order after yesterday &apos;s impressive rally . 
when selling began , potential buyers stood back to wait for prices to fall further , &quot; said a desk trader . 
the blue chip IPC index closed down 5.96 points , or 0.18 percent , at 3,390.48 points , off a low of 3,380.40 points earlier in the day . 
volume was average at 87.4 million shares traded . 
some traders attributed the slide in Mexico to the Dow Jones , which fell 19.75 points , or 0.31 percent , to 6,422.94 points . 
&quot; Although the Dow is just undergoing a normal technical correction , it did hit some Mexican ADRs , &quot; said a trader . 
media group Televisa &apos;s ADRs , for instance , ended off 1 / 2 at 26-3 / 4 and Televisa &apos;s CPO shares fell 3.30 pesos to 105.70 . 
on the broad market , 114 stocks changed hands , of which losers outnumbered gainers by 53 to 36 . 
cement company Cemex was a notable gainer , boosted by news its Spanish affiliate Valenciana had obtained a syndicated loan worth $ 850 million . 
traders noted the list of losers was largely headed by small companies and small trades . 
from a technical standpoint , analysts said the IPC had yet to break out of a stabilization band between 3,200 and 3,400 points . 
&quot; For the last three months stocks have been in demand below 3,200 points and on offer at 3,400 points . 
the secondary upward trend has yet to define itself in that band . 
while yesterday &apos;s rally was encouraging , we need to see more sessions like it if we are to reach all-time highs by the end of the year , &quot; an analyst said .
