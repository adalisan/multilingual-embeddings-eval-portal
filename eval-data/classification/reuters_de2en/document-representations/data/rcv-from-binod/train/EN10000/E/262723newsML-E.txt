China showered the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) with bouquets and blame on Tuesday , saying the body Beijing has long sought to join was important , but that it neglected poorer nations . 
a meeting of the WTO &apos;s 128 member states in Singapore this month had taken a lopsided approach to differing international needs , said Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang . 
&quot; This meeting finally reached a common understanding , but at the same time we should realise that the result of this meeting was not balanced enough , &quot; Shen told a news briefing . 
&quot; It mostly reflected the relations and interests of the developed countries , &quot; he said . 
Shen &apos;s comments came after the official China Daily newspaper published a front page report that suggested that after years of frustrated efforts to gain entry to the WTO , Beijing &apos;s enthusiasm was fading . 
&quot; Accession or not , China has become indifferent and doesn &apos;t care any more , &quot; it quoted Wu Jiahuang , director general of the customs administration &apos;s tariffs department , as saying . 
Wu compared China &apos;s decade-long bid for entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) and current attempts to join the WTO that succeeded it to a &quot; sunken boat &quot; and an &quot; ailing tree &quot; , the newspaper said . 
Western diplomats said Wu &apos;s comments were more a reflection of differing internal views on the importance of the global economy than a signal of a shift from Beijing &apos;s oft-stated desire for a seat in the world trade club . 
asked about the China Daily report , Shen said it did not necessarily reflect Beijing &apos;s formal position . 
&quot; We still feel the World Trade Organisation is a very important international organisation , although of course if China is not taking part then we should say it is incomplete , &quot; he said . 
Beijing seeks to join the WTO on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries . 
but some members -- with the United States the most vocal -- argue that China &apos;s economy is too powerful to be given such treatment . 
Beijing says it must be allowed a relatively long transition period to prepare key industries for the fierce foreign competition they would face under the WTO &apos;s freer trade rules . 
China &apos;s leadership had concluded that negotiations with WTO members on its entry terms were politically tainted , Wu said . 
the high-profile publication of Wu &apos;s downbeat views on WTO accession could be aimed at signalling that China was in no hurry to make concessions on terms , but was more likely an expression of internal differences , said one Western diplomat . 
&quot; They have their different interest groups in China , just as we have , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There are those who are charged with administering the tariffs and taking in the receipts and those who have a longer-term perspective on the whole thing . 
&quot; It doesn &apos;t change the basic fact that those who are charged with representing China in this matter do give us a different impression , &quot; he said . 
assistant Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation An Min was quoted on the inside pages of the China Daily as saying early entry could boost investment . 
&quot; optimistically speaking , the problem could be solved next year , &quot; An said .
