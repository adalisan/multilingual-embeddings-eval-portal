the Sri Lankan rupee ended unchanged on Tuesday at its previous close of 56.80 to the dollar after seeing little movement in the day , dealers said . 
the rupee appeared to recover slightly to 56.75 versus the dollar from the record low level in early trading but a couple of small orders pushed it back to 56.80 , they said . 
&quot; There was hardly any genuine demand . 
speculators were also mostly quiet because the rate is already close to the Central Bank top level , &quot; said a Deutsche Bank dealer . 
the Central Bank fixed buying and selling at 55.8385 and 56.9665 , pushing up the dollar by two local cents . 
dealers said an already lethargic market came to a virtual standstill after noon as dealers gathered around television sets to watch Sri Lankan cricketers play South Africa in Kenya . 
&quot; Since trading was dull no one felt guilty , &quot; said a Commercial Bank dealer . 
the overnight call money rate closed at 16 percent after opening at 15.25 , with the market well supplied , dealers said .
