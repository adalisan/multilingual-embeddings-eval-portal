as a youngster Robbie Fowler dreamt of growing up to wear the blue shirt of Everton -- and whacking the ball into opponent &apos;s nets . 
not yet 22 , Fowler has now achieved the second half of those schoolboy dreams 102 times -- not in the blue shirt of Everton but in the red shirt of Liverpool . 
for like his team-mate Steve McManaman , Fowler was an Everton supporter as a youngster who slipped through their net as a schoolboy to be signed by Liverpool . 
now he is a vital part of Roy Evans &apos; side bidding to bring the championship back to Anfield for the first time in seven years . 
and on Saturday he reached the personal milestone of 100 goals for his club , scoring four times in their 5-1 win over Middlesbrough . 
it took him just 29 seconds to open the scoring and his second goal after 28 minutes was the milestone 100th career goal -- coming in 165 matches . 
as a measure of just what a prodigious talent Fowler has , that is one match less than it took scoring legend Ian Rush to score his first 100 goals for Liverpool in the early 1980s . 
Fowler was still at school the last time Liverpool were champions in 1990 , but those four goals on Saturday kept Liverpool well on course to finish as champions this season . 
the bookmakers are narrowing the odds too , making Liverpool 2-1 favourites on Saturday . 
current leaders Arsenal , a point ahead of Liverpool and Wimbledon , are rated as 11-4 . 
Evans was naturally delighted with Fowler &apos;s efforts afterwards : &quot; We hope Robbie goes on to beat all Rushie &apos;s records , but this is a great start , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It is unbelievable he should have beaten his record as Rushie laid down standards at this club for others to follow . 
he is a legend around here and it was a great thrill to play with him . 
Fowler &apos;s first goal was the fastest in the premier league this season , and created an uphill task for Middlesbrough , who are slowly sinking into the relegation quicksand despite investing heavily in foreign signings . 
Stan Collymore , recalled to the side in place of &apos; flu victim Patrik Berger , was also impressive , making four of Liverpool &apos;s five goals . 
Evans said : &quot; There is not a better talent than Collymore in the game when his application is right . 
&quot; He keeps getting kicked in the teeth and I admit I might not have played him if Berger had been fit . 
he played today like he played last season and that &apos;s what we expect of him in the future . 
the first goal came when Collymore blasted a shot from the edge of the box which &apos; Boro keeper Gary Walsh only partially blocked before Fowler followed up to score . 
the second came after another Collymore shot bounced back off the post , Fowler was the first to react and steered it home . 
in the second half he showed typical opportunism to grab his third and fourth goals of the afternoon . 
Stig Inge Bjornebye was Liverpool &apos;s other scorer on a day Fowler and Liverpool will long remember .
