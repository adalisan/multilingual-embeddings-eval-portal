blue-chip stocks rebounded smartly Tuesday from steep early losses sparked by the U.S. missile attack on Iraq and fears of higher interest rates . 
at 1 p.m. EDT , the Dow Jones industrial average was up 16.64 points at 5,632.85 after rallying from a deep sell-off of more than 50 points . 
but in the broader market , declining issues led advances 2-1 on moderate volume of 208 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
the Nasdaq composite index lost 3.21 points to 1,138.29 . 
in the bond market , the 30-year Treasury bond rose 5 / 32 and its yield , which moves in the opposite direction from the price , slipped to 7.11 percent from 7.12 percent at Friday &apos;s close . 
analysts said a key economic indicator -- the National Association of Purchasing Management &apos;s index for August -- calmed fears of higher interest rates . 
the index came in at 52.6 compared with Wall Street &apos;s forecast of 52.9 . 
earlier , the U.S. missile attack on Iraq and worries of higher interest rates rattled the market , sending the Dow index tumbling just eight minutes after the opening bell . 
Peter Canelo , Dean Witter &apos;s chief investment strategist , said concerns about economic growth and a possible hike in rates by the Federal Reserve were the most serious factors facing the market . 
he cited recent data , including strong durable goods orders and sharply higher new homes sales , pointing to an economy stronger than many analysts expected . 
Canelo said the uncertainty surrounding interest rates prompted Dean Witter on Tuesday to cut its stock and bond allocations by 5 percent each , opting for cash . 
&quot; The Fed is really behind the curve , and they don &apos;t really have a choice on whether they will raise rates by a one-quarter or a one-half point , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The market is not yet priced to handle that kind of a hike . 
Canelo said the stock market faced volatility and uncertainty in the three weeks between now and the Sept . 24 meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee . 
&quot; I think the Fed will look for any reason to stay away from tightening monetary policy at the next meeting , &quot; due to the coming election , said Roy Blumberg , chief investment strategist at Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross . 
Canelo said the situation in Iraq was &quot; less serious than some people would think . 
I don &apos;t believe it has major implications for the economy or for inflation , &quot; he said . 
oil prices rocketed after news of the missile attacks by the United States in southern Iraq , in retaliation for Baghdad &apos;s army offensive in Kurdish regions in northern Iraq . 
October crude oil was up 86 cents at $ 23.11 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange after initially soaring by more than $ 1.70 to a post-Gulf-War high . 
the shares of major oil companies rose , with Chevron Corp. up 1-1 / 8 to 60 , Texaco Inc. up 2-7 / 8 at 91-5 / 8 , Exxon Corp. , up 2-1 / 8 at 83-1 / 2 and Mobil Corp. up 2-3 / 4 at 115-1 / 2 . 
airline stocks were mauled on expected price increases for jet fuel . 
among the big losers , Delta Air Lines dropped 1-3 / 4 to 69-1 / 8 , AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines , fell 1-3 / 8 to 80-5 / 8 , United Airline &apos;s parent UAL Corp. lost 1 to 47 , and Trans World Airlines Inc. was off 3 / 4 to 12-5 / 8 .
