the overnight interbank rate remained at 5.5 percent on Tuesday due to lending by both foreign and local banks , dealers said . 
&quot; The overnight is a bit liquid and capped below six percent . 
foreign banks are still there but Malaysian banks are also coming out to lend , &quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank . 
earlier , other interbank rates fell due to continued lending by agent banks of the central Bank Negara Malaysia , dealers said . 
one-month money was last quoted at 7.25 percent against 7.5 percent on Monday . 
the three-month rate was at 7.5 percent against 7.8 percent . 
&quot; ( Bank Negara ) agents were lending on the one-month and three-month this morning , &quot; said another dealer . 
the central bank has been injecting funds over the past month to help ease market tightness and bring interbank rates down , dealers said . 
Bank Negara &apos;s massive intervention in the foreign exchange market in June to defend the ringgit from speculative attack had caused a liquidity squeeze in the money market . 
interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were up across the board to reflect softer interbank rates . 
at 0800 GMT , the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank offered Rate ( KLIBOR ) September contract was up five points to 92.46 , or an implied yield of 7.54 percent . 
the December contract rose one to 92.65 , or 7.35 percent while March 1998 was up two to 92.73 , or 7.27 percent .
