Russia &apos;s defence ministry acknowledged publicly on Thursday that weapons were illegally supplied by Moscow to Armenia for several years , an action neighbouring Azerbaijan has said raised the risk of war . 
&quot; From 1994-96 military technology was supplied free of charge to Armenia from the Russian defence ministry &apos;s stockpiles , &quot; defence minister Igor Rodionov wrote in a letter released to the media . 
the letter , addressed to to Aman Tuleyev , Russian minister for cooperation with the Commonwealth of Independent States , was dated February 28 and was released by Tuleyev on Thursday . 
a defence ministry spokesman confirmed the contents of the letter by telephone . 
Rodionov said the transfer -- including 84 tanks and 50 infantry combat vehicles -- took place without Russian government approval . 
he did not provide details of how the transfer of weapons took place or who was involved . 
the case &quot; has been sent to the main military prosecutor &apos;s office for further investigation , &quot; he said . 
Armenia &apos;s foreign ministry , which has previously denied weapons transfers , was not available for comment . 
Azerbaijan has condemned the shipments , first reported by Tuleyev last month , saying they violated a 1994 ceasefire designed to end a conflict with Armenia over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh . 
earlier this month Azeri Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov alleged Armenia had obtained offensive missile systems capable of carrying out a nuclear attack on his country . 
an Azeri defence ministry official claimed the rockets were shipped to Armenia from Russia during the last two years . 
&quot; These rockets have a radius of 300 km ( 190 miles ) and can be equipped with nuclear warheads , &quot; Hasanov said . 
Rodionov &apos;s letter made no mention of any missile systems . 
Ria news agency on Thursday quoted a representative of Rosvooruzheniye , the government agency which oversees arms sales , as doubting illegal transfers of weapons to Armenia . 
&quot; The existing rules of arms and military hardware trading completely preclude their sale without the relevant permission of the supreme bodies of the state power , &quot; Ria quoted the official as saying . 
Christian Armenia and Moslem Azerbaijan have been embroiled for nine years in a conflict over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh , populated by ethnic Armenians but surrounded by Azeri territory . 
more than 15,000 people were killed in a war over the issue before a ceasefire was declared in 1994 after Armenia made massive territorial gains .
