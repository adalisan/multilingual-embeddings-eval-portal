October was traded in 25 lots at 12.25 pence per therm , a fall of 0.05 pence , while another 25 lots changed hands in November at 13.35 pence , unchanged from Wednesdy &apos;s settlement . 
all the other months &apos; bid / offer ranges enclosed the price at Wednesday &apos;s close and buyers and sellers were less than two tenths of a penny apart for most of the months quoted . 
brokers said the unchanged IPE futures prices reflected directionless trade on the physical market . 
Transco said in a note to gas shippers a tender would be issued on Friday to sell Top Up gas and Operating margins gas in a phased disposal over the summer at rough and Partington . 
while the quantity of gas was not specified , the company said last month it would sell some 2.4 terawatt-hours ( 82 million therms ) of gas in a tender in June . 
brokers said the imminent tender was not having an immediate effect on prices because players in the market had been aware of it for some weeks .
