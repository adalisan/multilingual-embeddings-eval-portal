Italian shares closed mostly weaker on Wednesday in a tired , lacklustre market as concerns over forthcoming calls on the market for cash from ENI and San Paolo weighed on sentiment . 
the all-share Mibtel index finished 0.79 percent lower at 12,326 while the blue chip Mib30 index closed 0.81 percent down at 18,395. trading volumes dropped to 764 billion lire from 949.83 billion lire . 
disappointing mutual fund figures , showing a sharp slowdown in inflows into equity funds , were also a factor . 
Edison closed 4.96 percent lower at 8,279 lire , dragged down by continued concern that a planned electricity generating venture involving ENI and Enel would put the company under competitive pressure . 
Rinascente also took a battering , closing 772 lire lower at 8,586 lire on the back of a deal between Ifil and France &apos;s Auchan to take joint ownership of the Italian retailer . 
brokers said that the market was now coming to terms with the fact that a large planned capital increase by Rinascente , which is part of the deal , would lead to , significant short term dilution of earnings per share . 
&quot; It looks like minority holders of Rinascente stock have lost out badly from this , &quot; said an equities specialist with a foreign-owned finance house . 
Ifil closed 0.58 percent higher at 5,203 lire . 
Marzotto shares continued their upward climb , closing 3.89 percent higher at 13,309 lire as the market reassessed the stock after the planned merger with HPI came unstuck at the weekend .
