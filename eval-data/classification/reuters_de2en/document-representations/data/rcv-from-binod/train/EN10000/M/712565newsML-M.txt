European oil swaps were all broadly stronger on Tuesday as screen crude showed signs of firmness , but dealers said activity was still fairly slender . 
Brent CFDs gained a few cents , fuel rose $ 1 and gasoline and naphtha firmed $ 4 and $ 2 respectively . 
Brent CFDs for the balance of this week widened out to + 7-10 cents against August Brent compared with + 6 / 7 cents on Monday while July 14-18 edged up to -15 cents from -19 cents . 
July 21-25 was put at -18 / 19 cents from -19 while July 28-Aug 1 actually weakened to -22 cents from 19 cents . 
little CFD action was seen although a July 14-25 was sold at September -22 cents . 
heavy fuel gained about $ 1 with July trading at $ 85.50 a couple of times and August went at $ 85.75 . 
September was 75 cents to $ 1 stronger than August . 
&quot; We will need a bigger move in crude than we have been having to get fuel moving , &quot; said one dealer , commenting on the sparse swaps trading . 
gasoline swaps were around $ 4 a tonne stronger with July hovering around $ 187 by the close of the day . 
July traded at $ 185.50 earlier in the day and August went at $ 186.00 . 
dealers said gasoline &apos;s strength was partly attributable to a lack of sellers , particularly in July . 
Naphtha was about $ 2 a tonne stronger on swaps with a couple of p + c deals done around $ 176.50-177.50 for July paper . 
dealers said the move higher reflected the generally mild upturn in the energy complex rather than anything specific to the naphtha market .
