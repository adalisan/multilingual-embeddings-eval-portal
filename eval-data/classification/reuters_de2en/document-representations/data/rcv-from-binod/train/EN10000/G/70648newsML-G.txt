Pope John Paul was &quot; very pleased &quot; with his four-day trip to France , the chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said on Monday . 
&quot; The Pope was very pleased , in particular yesterday at Reims , where there were 200,000 people , many of them young people , &quot; Navarro-Valls told reporters . 
&quot; The Holy Father was particularly struck by their seriousness and concentration in prayer , a very positive sign of faith . 
&apos; This , &apos; the Pope commented , &apos; is the France of tomorrow &apos; , &quot; Navarro-Valls added . 
the Pontiff bore up well to the demanding trip despite frail health and won praise in France for defusing controversy on a visit when huge crowds at his masses dwarfed scattered protests . 
&quot; The visit surpassed our most optimistic hopes , &quot; said Bernard Lagoutte , secretary-general of the French Bishops &apos; Conference . 
the trip , which culminated in a mass in Reims to honour the 1,500th anniversary of the baptism of king Clovis , the first monarch in western Europe to convert to Roman Catholicism , was the last abroad before the 76-year-old Polish Pontiff enters hospital to have his appendix removed . 
he is due to stay at his summer residence in Castelgandolfo , south of Rome , until the end of the month . 
cardinal Camillo Ruini , president of the Italian Bishops &apos; Conference , urged Catholics to pray for the Pope &apos;s health . 
&quot; Now we shall wait , without unfounded alarmism , the surgery which has been announced but let us accompany the wait with insistent prayer , &quot; Ruini said .
