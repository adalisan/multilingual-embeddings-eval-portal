Britain and Russia launched a plan on Friday to build a memorial to the 26 million people from the former Soviet Union who were killed in World War Two . 
the joint Russian-British project envisages the unveiling of a monument in the grounds of London &apos;s Imperial War Museum in 1998 , the Russian embassy said . 
the monument would be made by a Russian sculptor and paid for by subscriptions from the public in Russia and abroad . 
&quot; The spirit of this memorial is for peace and reconciliation , &quot; the Russian embassy said . 
&quot; The Cold War which divided Europe and the world for so long has ended and the monument will carry the message of greater understanding of the suffering that war can bring to all sides . 
the idea of locating the memorial in London arose after ceremonies held in 1945 at the graves of Soviet soldiers who died in military hospitals in war ally Britain in 1945 .
