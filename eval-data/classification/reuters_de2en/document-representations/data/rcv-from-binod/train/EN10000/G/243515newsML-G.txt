the United States increased pressure on Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday , cancelling a senior-level meeting with him , as one senior official said , &quot; We are cutting him off little by little . 
assistant U.S. Secretary of State John Kornblum , the special envoy on Bosnia , had been scheduled to meet Milosevic in Belgrade this week after a NATO meeting but had decided to call off the visit , a senior U.S. official said . 
&quot; We &apos;re cutting him ( Milosevic ) off little by little , &quot; said the official , adding that Kornblum had called off the meeting &quot; because he doesn &apos;t think it &apos;s useful to talk to Milosevic at this particular moment . 
&quot; He added : &quot; It &apos;s in reaction to recent events , absolutely . 
Kornblum acted after Serbia &apos;s top court awarded control of Belgrade city council to the ruling Socialists after an election that the opposition was widely viewed as having won . 
State Department spokesman Glyn Davies told reporters that Washington perceived this move as &quot; a continuing attempt by the ruling party to control these municipalities in defiance of the will of the Serbian voters . 
Kornblum &apos;s decision also followed reports of the beating in prison of Dejan Bulatovic , 21 , a worker who was arrested on Friday for carrying an effigy of Milosevic in prison garb . 
&quot; We &apos;re turning up the flame on the bunson burner here on Slobodan Milosevic and his party and he &apos;ll eventually feel the heat , we believe , &quot; Davies said at a briefing . 
&quot; We &apos;ve warned the Serbian government that repression of the protesters will have serious consequences , and will inevitably lead to Serbia &apos;s further isolation from the international community , &quot; he added . 
&quot; Even though it is not a completely open Western society such as the United States , clearly pressure works in Serbia , &quot; Davies said . 
&quot; And we just have to keep the pressure on to see what we can accomplish here . 
the weekend court ruling to allow the ruling Socialists to run the Belgrade city council drew some 30,000 protesters to central Belgrade on Monday for demonstrations against the Milosevic government . 
Davies demurred when asked whether Washington was supporting the protesters , saying the United States was providing &quot; moral support &quot; and urging that the demonstrations remain peaceful .
