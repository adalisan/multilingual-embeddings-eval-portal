French stocks closed at a historic high on Monday after Wall Street &apos;s latest gains encouraged investors to break a three-year-old record on the bourse . 
the blue chip CAC-40 index rose 33.77 points , or 1.45 percent , to close at 2,361.27 , surpassing the previous closing record of 2,355.93 set on February 2 , 1994 . 
it also set a new intraday high of 2,371.38 points . 
volume was a heavy 7.7 billion francs . 
&quot; The bourse is swept up by Wall Street , by the bond markets and by expectations of higher corporate results in France for 1997 , &quot; said Jean-Pierre Filbien , director of sales at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Paris . 
the U.S. Dow Jones industrial average set its fourth closing record of the new year last Friday after closing up 78 points at 6,703.67 . 
it was modestly higher in early trading on Monday . 
Christian Mariais , a portfolio manager at Paris brokerage Oddo , said the Dow &apos;s gains reassurred investors who had feared that Wall Street &apos;s bull run would end just as the French bourse came up to speed . 
&quot; The U.S. market is rising because U.S. company profits are higher . 
the outlook for earnings in 1997 is good , so there may be a correction on Wall Street , but we &apos;re not expecting a crash , &quot; Mariais said . 
although the French economy is growing very slowly , the rise in the dollar , low French interest rates and corporate restructurings are expected to boost company profits this year . 
Mariais estimated the bourse would advance at the same pace as last year , when the CAC-40 index rose 23.71 percent . 
its price-earnings ratio is 20 times estimated 1996 earnings and 16.5 times estimated 1997 earnings . 
until late last year , the bourse sat out the rally sweeping the U.S. and European bourses to new records . 
but most analysts and strategists say the French market is upward bound , at least for the first half of 1997 . 
&quot; The gainers may not be the same issues . 
the advance this year may favour cyclical shares , but for the index , the increase should be about the same , &quot; Mariais said . 
although most analysts and fund managers expect the French market to hit 2,450 points , they were divided over its near-term prospects . 
some predicted a correction after its rapid rise . 
&quot; The indicators are signalling that the market &apos;s overbought . 
there &apos;s a risk of a violent retracement that could take us back as far as 2,200 points , &quot; said Pierre Amancic , deputy director of IFF Bourse . 
Daniel Dourmat , fund manager at Caisse Centrale des Banques populaires , said the key factor was Wall Street &apos;s performance . 
but he said he was slightly worried that the weakness in the Tokyo market could undermine other bourses if Japanese investors were obliged to sell assets abroad to cover losses at home . 
the leading French blue chip on Monday was carmaker Renault &apos;s stock , which has languished near all-time lows for weeks . 
it surged 4.15 percent to 113 francs . 
brokers said the stock was helped by Chairman Louis Schweitzer &apos;s remarks in a newspaper interview that he hoped for a break-even this year in the money-losing car division . 
the stock has also been helped by reports describing the huge popularity of the new Megane Scenic model . 
shares in oil majors Elf Aquitaine and Total rose on the back of gains in crude prices and in the dollar . 
brokers said Elf , which closed up 1.6 percent at 495.70 francs , was helped by an oil exploration deal signed with the government of Azerbaijan . 
they said Total , which rose 1.51 percent to 424.30 francs , was boosted by PaineWebber &apos;s move to start covering the stock .
