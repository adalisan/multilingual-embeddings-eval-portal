Argentine bonds surged Monday on hopes Argentina could enter into a debt buyback or swap deal in the months to come . 
traders reported strong buyer interest amid busy trade as talk of the buyback boosted already strong sentiment . 
market players anticipated the strong mood could be sustained in the sessions to come . 
the approval last week by Brazil &apos;s Congress to allow the central bank to buy back debt in addition to the pricing of a Mexican bond Monday fed the fuel of expectations that a buyback deal could be in the offing for Argentina . 
the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 rose $ 0.45 to 118.55 while Argentina &apos;s FRB due 2005 rose 1-6 / 8 to 83-6 / 8 . 
the longer dated dollar-denominated Bocon Provisional 2 due 2007 jumped $ 1.20 to 102.10 . 
&quot; There are already rumors of a swap in the market , &quot; said a portfolio manager at a large Argentine bank . 
an analyst at a large foreign bank seconded that , saying &quot; the chances ( of a buyback ) increase as offers increase . 
&quot; The announcement of a $ 750 million , 20-year bond issue by Mexico with a spread between 450 basis points and 462.5 basis points over treasuries added to the expectations of more offers for Latin American issues . 
the portfolio manager suggested any Argentine swap deal could include the buyback of part of the Bocon bonds , nearly all of which start paying principal and interest for the first time next year . 
if the government owned more of the bonds , its debt servicing payments could be lowered next year . 
market players said considering how entrenched the positive sentiment in the market has become , there would probably be further gains in the days to come . 
still , at least one analyst at a local bank said she was surprised the market has not yet run into a bout of profit-taking . 
on the other hand , despite the failure of the passage of the government &apos;s tax hiking measure through Congress last week , expectations that Congress will pass the measures this Wednesday are running high . 
if the measures do not get smooth passage this time around , the market may not be so forgiving . 
analysts said the market also continued to benefit from the subsiding fears of a hike in U.S. rates this month and high global liquidity levels . 
in the money markets , one day call money rates fell to 6.65 percent from 6.70 percent .
