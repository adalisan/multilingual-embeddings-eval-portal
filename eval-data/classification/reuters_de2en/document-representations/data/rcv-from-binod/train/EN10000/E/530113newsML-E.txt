foreign orders for Taiwan goods rose 5.61 percent to US $ 10.473 billion in March compared to March 1996 , the economics ministry said on Tuesday . 
the official March export order figure was sharply higher than an average forecast of a slow 1.95 percent growth that resulted from an April 18 Reuters poll of Taiwan economists . 
that survey had shown divergent expectations , ranging from a pessimistic forecast of a 1.87 percnet downturn in March export orders to the most optimistic forecast of a 4.87 percent year-on-year rise . 
the following is a table of export data in million of U.S. dollars : 
March 97 February 97 March 96 
export orders 10,473 8,697 9,917 
March &apos;s export orders figure was the highest since September 1996 &apos;s record high of US $ 10.51 billion . 
economics ministry official Chang Yao-chung said a March 20 outbreak of hog foot-and-mouth disease had shaved some US $ 100 million off the island &apos;s March export orders . 
April &apos;s export orders will be reduced by US $ 130 million due to the deadly disease , Chang said . 
Taiwan had banned pork exports and ordered a mass slaughter and inoculation drive after confirming an outbreak of the foot and month disease at nine hog farms in March . 
Japan and South Korea have maintained a ban on pork imports from Taiwan even though the Taiwan government lifted its own ban on April 17 . 
orders from Japan , Taiwan &apos;s main pork export destination , fell 6.01 percent to $ 1.2 billion due to the disease . 
geographically , the United States remained Taiwan &apos;s biggest market with export orders rising 4.84 percent from a year ago to US $ 3.12 billion . 
information and telecommunication products topped the island &apos;s main exports to the United States . 
Hong Kong was next with orders totalling $ 1.77 billion , down 6.8 percnet from March 1996 . 
in sectoral terms , telecommunication and informational products orders accounted for $ 1.67 billion of the total , rising 14.7 percent from a year ago . 
textile orders grew 8.15 percent to $ 1.41 billion , while base metal products orders increased 11.78 percent to $ 890 million .
