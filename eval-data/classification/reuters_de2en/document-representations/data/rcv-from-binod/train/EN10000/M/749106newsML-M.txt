in overnight commodity markets , copper prices eased on higher stocks while gold fell again after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s comments that the recent gold price slump reflected falling inflationary expectations . 
wheat prices rose on U.S. export hopes and oil prices rose again on strong petroleum product demand in Western markets in the Northern driving season . 
the main commodity market action on Wednesday was on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) where copper shrugged off recent supply concerns but problems loomed for zinc and aluminium . 
three months delivery copper prices dropped up to $ 30 a tonne at one stage as the premium for spot delivery narrowed in to around $ 60 from $ 270 last week . 
trade sources said the supply fears which had caused the high premiums had been alleviated by a sharp influx of copper , about a 55 percent increase to 200,950 tonnes , into LME registered warehouses during July . 
zinc prices leaped to a seven-year high of $ 1,558 a tonne for three months delivery metal as traders became concerned that a developing battle between Chinese producers and a European merchant and investment funds could starve the market of metal during September . 
the producers were believed by traders to be committed to deliver sizeable quantities of metal against LME contracts , held by merchants and investors . 
if the producers can not come up with the metal by the due dates , believed to be in September , then spot premiums will soar as they rush to buy back their short &apos; paper &apos; positions . 
the spot premium for zinc on Wednesday was already around $ 20 a tonne compared with a $ 10 discount last week . 
some potential supply tightness for September was also noted in aluminium , although to a lesser extent than in zinc , and the normal spot discount of over $ 20 a tonne was halved . 
this , coupled with steadily falling LME stocks saw the three months price rise to a two-months high of $ 1,847 a tonne . 
after hitting an 11-day high last Friday , gold prices slipped lower again late Tuesday and Wednesday , on talk of European central bank selling around $ 330.00 , and on news South Africa &apos;s Western Areas Gold Mining Co Ltd said it had completed a buy back of 1.6 million ounces of a 7.3 million ounce forward sale arranged in 1995 . 
Greenspan said U.S. economic growth was slowing , inflation in 1997 was modest , and the falling gold price reflected a lowering of inflation expectations , all of which meant a near term monetary policy tightening could be avoided . 
in the bullion market , spot gold was quoted around $ 322.75 / 25 , compared to the London Wednesday afternoon fix at $ 324.90 , and the New York close Tuesday around $ 325.30 / 80 . 
CBOT soft red winter wheat futures closed higher on Wednesday on export hopes and fund buying , traders said . 
there was talk Egypt this weekend may buy from 500,000 to one million tones of U.S. soft red winter wheat for September and October shipment . 
wheat closed 6 1 / 4 to 11 1 / 2 cents per bushel higher , with September up seven at US $ 3.56 3 / 4 . 
oil prices ticked up again on Wednesday without showing any sign of shifting from the tight range which has smothered crude trade since early June . 
London futures for benchmark Brent blend rose 17 cents a barrel to close at $ 18.39 . 
Brent has remained above $ 18 despite the threat of a deluge of Iraqi exports within the next few weeks when Baghdad is expected to implement the second phase of its U.N. oil-for-food deal . 
traders attribute the market resilience to strong petroleum product demand in western markets , combined with recent supply disruptions .
