third seed Michael Chang successfully defended his Champions Cup title and ended the best week of Bohdan Ulihrach &apos;s life with a 4-6 6-3 6-4 6-3 victory over the unseeded Czech Sunday . 
it was the third-ranked Chang &apos;s third career win at Indian Wells and his 28th career title . 
&quot; I think it &apos;s great just to be able to survive , &quot; Chang said of his win . 
I can do a bit of fishing , relax , come out here and play good tennis . 
in the midst of an impressive start to 1997 , Chang has a 17-2 match record this year , a 10-match winning streak and two titles . 
his other tournament victory of the year was at Memphis in February . 
Chang kept the tournament in American hands for the seventh straight year . 
Swede Stefan Edberg was the last foreigner to hoist the trophy , in 1990 . 
it was a first-time meeting between Chang and the 43rd-ranked Ulihrach , who will move into the top 30 in the rankings Monday . 
Ulihrach came to this event without having gone past the second round in the seven previous tournaments he played this year . 
it looked like the second-round curse would remain alive since Ulihrach was playing top seed Pete Sampras . 
but Ulihrach played better than Sampras and captured his second career victory over the world number one . 
best week of my life . 
Ulihrach , who has won two career titles on clay , was playing in his first hardcourt final . 
through the first set of the final , the Czech had won 11 straight sets . 
for Chang , who won $ 337,000 , the first set was a struggle as he needed time to puzzle out a strategy to defeat a virtual unknown entity . 
Ulihrach , who won $ 177,000 as runner-up , hits the ball extremely flat and hard from the baseline and , at first , Chang seemed content to try to slug it out from the backcourt . 
I was able to hang in there and fight my way through . 
in the next three sets , however , Chang played a better waiting game and picked his spots to become aggressive . 
he began playing a more all-court game -- serving better , angling shots to diffuse Ulihrach &apos;s power , journeying to the net . 
following the first set , where his serve was broken twice , Chang never again lost his serve . 
in the second set , Chang scored the service break when Ulihrach doubles faulted at 0-40 in the eighth game . 
the scenario for the service break in the third set was exactly the same as the second set -- Ulihrach double faulted at 0-40 in the first game . 
in the fourth set , Chang broke serve twice in the fifth and ninth games .
