the season &apos;s opening World Cup Alpine skiing men &apos;s super giant slalom was cancelled on Sunday due to heavy overnight snowfall and poor visibility at Whistler Mountain . 
upwards of seven inches ( 20 cm ) fell overnight , adding to the already extensive snowfall which had wiped out Saturday &apos;s men &apos;s downhill and the three training runs earlier in the week in preparation for the season opening men &apos;s speed races . 
there was some irony that excessive snowfall forced the cancellation after officials had made a great deal of man-made snow in preparation for the racing . 
a total of 633 course workers spent over 30,000 man hours , many in darkness , preparing the course . 
the men &apos;s and women &apos;s Alpine Ski World Cup circuit now moves to Val d &apos;Isere , France , for men &apos;s and women &apos;s downhill and super giant slalom races this week .
