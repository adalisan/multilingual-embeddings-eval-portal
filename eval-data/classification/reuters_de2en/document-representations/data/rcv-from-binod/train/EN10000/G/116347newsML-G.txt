holders Paris St Germain will be without their best player Leonardo for the tough away leg against Galatasaray of Turkey in the second round of the European Cup Winners &apos; Cup on Thursday . 
Leonardo , whose seven goals and incisive midfield play have helped PSG open a seven-point lead in the French first division , has been called up by Mario Zagallo to play in Brazil &apos;s friendly at home to Lithuania . 
&quot; We &apos;ll surely miss him , &quot; fellow midfielder Vincent Guerin said at Tuesday &apos;s training session . 
&quot; But I think we have enough good players to manage without him . 
Laurent Fournier will probably move forward into Leonardo &apos;s attacking midfield role , with Jose Cobos coming into the defence at left back . 
PSG are bracing themselves for a tough clash in Istanbul &apos;s Ali Sami yen stadium after an easy first-round tie against Vaduz of Liechtenstein , whom they beat 7-0 on aggregate .
