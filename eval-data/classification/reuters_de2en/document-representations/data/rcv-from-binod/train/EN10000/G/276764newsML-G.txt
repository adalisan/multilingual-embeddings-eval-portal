a Malaysian politician charged with trying to take out A $ 1.2 million ( US $ 960,000 ) from Australia without approval has been asked to submit a report about the matter to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad . 
domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Abu Hassan Omar said the politician , Muhammad Muhammad Taib , had informed him of the request in a phone call from Auckland on Tuesday , the national Bernama news agency reported on Thursday . 
Muhammad , chief minister of central Selangor state , was still in Auckland and trying to book a ticket home , Abu Hassan said . 
Muhammad was arrested at Brisbane airport on Sunday and charged in a local court with trying to take the equivalent of A $ 1.2 million in Malaysian , Singaporean and New Zealand dollars out of Australia without approval . 
under Australian law , people leaving the country must declare and justify any amount over A $ 5,000 in whatever currency . 
Abu Hassan said that Muhammad had told him the money , which was found in his luggage , was his own . 
the chief minister did not enter a plea to the charge and will reappear in court in March 21 . 
Muhammad is chairman of the Selangor state United Malays National Organisation &apos;s ( UMNO ) liaison committee . 
Malaysian opposition leader Lim Kit Siang questioned why Muhammad was carrying &quot; such vast sums of cash &quot; . 
&quot; This question calls for immediate and satisfactory explanation , &quot; Lim said in a statement on Thursday .
