Republicans scored one of their biggest victories in the 1994 congressional elections in the heart of Chicago by knocking off legendary Democratic House power broker Dan Rostenkowski . 
two years later , &quot; Rosty &quot; is in jail for corruption but the Democrats seem likely to recapture his old seat . 
the reason : Rostenkowski &apos;s Republican successor Michael Flanagan let himself become too closely associated with an agenda that is widely unpopular among voters in his heavily urban district . 
Rod Blagojevich , a 39-year-old Illinois state legislator who has the support of the remnants of Chicago &apos;s Democratic political machine , said his internal polls showed him leading Flanagan -- figures disputed by the Flanagan campaign . 
&quot; It feels really good out there , &quot; Blagojevich said . 
he said his optimism stemmed in part from animosity toward House Speaker Newt Gingrich in a diverse district spread across heavily Democratic Chicago . 
&quot; Flanagan has had an opportunity on a host of issues to vote his district but has chosen instead to vote to become a fellow traveller in the Gingrich revolution , &quot; Blagojevich said . 
&quot; But Flanagan supports Gingrich for speaker , which sets in motion a whole agenda that Gingrich has driven which has been harmful to working middle-income families in our neighbourhoods . 
a recent Democratic-sponsored poll showed Blagojevich had overtaken the incumbent by eight percentage points among likely Fifth Congressional District voters . 
the poll had an error margin of 4.4 percent . 
a poll paid for by Flanagan showed the Republican leading by a similar margin . 
the election in this Chicago district is one of 50 or so that could decide which party gets majority control of the 435-member House of Representatives . 
and the incumbent has become the underdog . 
&quot; To be within striking distance against one of the most formidable political armies ever assembled in Chicago , that &apos;s pretty good , &quot; Flanagan &apos;s campaign manager , Thom Serafin , said . 
he said he expected to be far outspent by the Democratic challenger , whom he called a &quot; mini-Bill Clinton &quot; for his campaign skills and alleged legislative failures . 
Blagojevich said he would run strongest in the working-class &quot; bungalow belt &quot; of the Northwest Side and among lakefront yuppies , while suburban precincts will be &quot; a challenge . 
&quot; one-quarter of the district &apos;s residents are foreign-born , and German , Polish and Hungarian are spoken in some neighbourhoods . 
in 1994 Flanagan , an unknown lawyer with a no political track record , was viewed as the accidental beneficiary of Rostenkowski &apos;s legal troubles , which have since landed the 36-year congressman in prison . 
the onetime chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee was sentenced to 17 months in prison after a plea bargain on charges he misused campaign funds and hired ghost payrollers . 
&quot; We think ( Flanagan &apos;s ) campaign was more of a stealth candidacy -- sort of hide in the basement and wait for people to vote against Rostenkowski , &quot; Blagojevich said . 
Rostenkowski was renowned for securing federal money and tax breaks for local projects and Flanagan has suprised some by using his relationship with Gingrich and his cachet as a rare Republican representing a largely urban district to win millions of federal dollars to help rebuild Chicago &apos;s crumbling lakefront and public transit system . 
but as one of Rostenkowski &apos;s most strident critics , he has had to defend the newly acquired federal largess as &quot; good projects , not pork . 
Blagojevich counters that Flanagan has a minuscule record , which includes a recent bill to confer honorary citizenship on Mother Teresa , that is out of step with his middle-class constituents . 
&quot; He thinks big government ought to be there to help big corporate special interests , &quot; he said .
