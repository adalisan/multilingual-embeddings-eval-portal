maize and milling wheat futures prices rose on the Budapest commodity Exchange ( BCE ) on Friday in meagre turnover . 
dealers said they expected trade to lack direction until the second half of February . 
&quot; Prices are going up by limit , then down , but there is no identifiable trend yet , &quot; said Mihaly Otvos of OTP Forex . 
he expected activity to pick up as March contracts ran out . 
&quot; Hardly anybody is prepared to deliver , so they will start getting out of those positions , &quot; he added . 
old ( 1996 ) crop maize prices closed at between 19,600 forints for March and 19,000 for July while 1997 crop prices ended at between 19,650 for October and 20,800 for December . 
milling wheat prices went up by 70 to 400 forints for most maturities except December , which was unchanged . 
&quot; Some press reports caused renewed concern regarding ice damage to the crop , &quot; Otvos said . 
dealers said , however , that reliable crop forecasts cannot be expected before late March . 
Friday &apos;s total turnover was 81.4 million forints or 156 contracts , half of which were for maize . 
lot size is 20,000 kg for all contracts .
