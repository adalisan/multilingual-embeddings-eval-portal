a German court trying the father of tennis star Steffi Graf for tax-dodging said on Friday the charges might be downgraded from serious tax evasion , halving to five years the maximum possible penalty he faces . 
judge Joachim Plass said the court could drop some of the charges against Peter Graf who , with family adviser Joachim Eckardt , is accused of funnelling abroad a proportion of the world number one &apos;s earnings totalling 42 million marks ( $ 27.8 million at today &apos;s rates ) between 1989 and 1993 . 
dropping charges concerning alleged evasion of wealth taxes in Germany and the non-reporting of some of Steffi &apos;s earnings in tournaments abroad , as Plass suggested , would reduce the case to one of routine tax evasion and lower the penalties . 
&quot; This is a clear reduction of the charges , &quot; said Eckardt &apos;s lawyer Bernd Schneider who , with Graf &apos;s lawyer Franz Salditt , has argued that Steffi did not have to report all her earnings abroad to the German tax authorities . 
U.S. tax authorities have appeared to bear this out by indicating they may put in a claim for tax on some of Graf &apos;s earnings . 
senior prosecutor Hubert Jobski said the change would not have much effect on any eventual punishment if Graf and Eckardt were convicted . 
Peter Graf , who managed his daughter &apos;s finances , has been in detention since August 1995 and went on trial in Mannheim in September . 
known for collecting his daughter &apos;s fees in cash in plastic bags , he admits putting the money out of the reach of German tax collectors . 
but he says the authorities approved this to keep Steffi from joining other German sporting tax exiles . 
the defence attorneys want the court to rule next week whether Graf and Eckardt may be freed from jail on bail . 
also on Friday , the court heard local tax officials defend their decision not to investigate Steffi Graf &apos;s tax returns in the 1980s when the first indications emerged that her father might be channelling money abroad . 
they began investigations in the early 1990s after Dutch tax officials indicated to them that a sponsoring firm that Graf had launched in the Netherlands might be used for tax evasion , one official told the court . 
Peter Graf admitted in court last month he had erred in filing false German tax returns but insisted the damage done was not as great as it could have been . 
&quot; I cannot say that I acted properly in tax matters , &quot; he said , but added : &quot; If my daughter had emigrated , the German ( tax ) authorities would have been far worse off .
