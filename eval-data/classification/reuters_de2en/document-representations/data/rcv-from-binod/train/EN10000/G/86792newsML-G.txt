Burma &apos;s military goverment said on Monday 109 pro-democracy activists were still being detained and checkpoints manned by armed police at the road leading to Aung San Suu Kyi &apos;s house remained in place for the fourth day . 
&quot; There are 109 people still being held in guest houses , &quot; a senior government official told Reuters when asked about reports of up to 500 detentions . 
&quot; How long they are kept there depends on the other side , it is very hard to tell . 
he said roadblocks manned by heavily-armed security police would not be removed until authorities were sure the National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party would not take any action . 
the checkpoints were set up on all roads leading to Suu Kyi &apos;s University Avenue residence early on Friday to prevent a three-day NLD congress from being held there . 
the government said the meeting was illegal and would create instability , but the NLD said the purpose of the gathering was to celebrate the eighth anniversary of the party &apos;s founding . 
&quot; If nothing is going to take place , then the police may leave . 
but if they think that something might go on they may not leave very quickly , &quot; the official said . 
he said heavy traffic likely to result from the roadblocks on University Avenue , one of Rangoon &apos;s main thoroughfares , could also influence when the checkpoints would be removed . 
police had originally said the roadblocks would be up only through Sunday . 
the official said several dozen democracy supporters had been briefly detained near the checkpoints over the weekend , but were released several blocks from where they were picked up . 
hundreds of people were seen near the checkpoints on Saturday . 
most had apparently not heard the road was blocked and came to attend the weekly speech Suu Kyi makes at her house . 
several dozen young men who refused police orders to move away from the checkpoints were put on military trucks and driven away by the authorities , witnesses said . 
&quot; They were taken to a place not too far away and dropped off ... and they went home , &quot; the official said . 
the NLD was co-founded by Suu Kyi in August 1988 after months of unprecedented demonstrations against military rule . 
the party won a landslide victory in a 1990 election but the results were never recognised by the military government .
