* Australian bonds resumed the heady rally spanning the past 2-1 / 2 months as the short-end of the market saw the buoyancy of the local currency increasing the chances of a policy easing . 
* ten-year bond yield gets close to clearing 7.0 percent . 
Australian bonds resumed the heady rally spanning the past 2-1 / 2 months as the short-end of the market saw the buoyancy of the local currency increasing the chances of a policy easing , analysts said . 
bill futures charged ahead at the opening with the March contract touching a high of 93.91 , pointing to a cash rate of 6.09 percent by maturity compared with current 6.50 percent official interest rates . 
three-year bond yields finally made a clean break below 6.50 percent , but while long bond yields touched new 33-month lows at one stage , solid resistance remains at 7.0 percent . 
&quot; The dollar &apos;s strength has certainly helped to kick-on the short-end , &quot; one trader said . 
the currency has put on 2-1 / 4 cents in the past week , effectively tightening monetary policy when the authorities have been setting easier conditions to restart the economy after its recent soft patch . 
Stephen Roberts , chief economist at UBS , agreed that the dollar &apos;s strength does raise the possibility of a rate cut . 
however , Roberts added that wages growth is likely to determine the next move in policy . 
the latest report on enterprise bargain agreements is expected to be released next week , along with third quarter capital expenditure on Monday , which includes the fourth estimate of business investment intentions . 
both of these reports are seen as critical as to whether the Reserve Bank eases policy again , after the central bank gave them such a high priority in last month &apos;s quartely Bulletin . 
Robertson , one of the few analysts to predict the first rate cut in July , is putting a 35 percent chance of a December easing following this month &apos;s 50 basis point rate reduction . 
meanwhile , the benchmark November 2006 bond straddled 7.0 percent at one stage after the December 10-year bond futures contract breached last week &apos;s 92.950 high to 92.995 . 
buying by computerised futures trading accounts drew out stop-loss buying and flamed the rally , but this was again met by solid domestic selling , traders added . 
bond yield spreads to other dollar bloc bonds narrowed sharply , but the Australian / U.S. 
10-year margin is finding resistance around 90 basis points , and only briefly breached this level during the session .
