shuttle Atlantis edged ever closer to the Russian space station Mir on Wednesday to give space endurance champ Shannon lucid a ride home . 
the shuttle , carrying lucid &apos;s replacement and thousands of pounds of supplies , was due to dock with Mir at 10 : 13 p.m. CDT ( 0313 GMT on Thursday ) as the two craft soar high above Russia . 
the shuttle &apos;s final approach ended a three-day chase through space that began early on Monday with a pre-dawn blast-off from Florida &apos;s Kennedy Space Centre . 
the astronauts caught their first glimpse of the sprawling Russian space complex from a distance of 52 miles ( 84 km ) . 
&quot; We can see Shannon smiling from here , &quot; joked shuttle skipper Bill Readdy . 
the shuttle was running nearly seven weeks late on its promise to return lucid to Earth . 
the 53-year-old mother of three arrived at Mir in March and was due home in early August , but rocket problems , a threatening hurricane and a scheduling clash with an unmanned rocket delayed the shuttle &apos;s planned July 31 launch . 
as the shuttle closed in , lucid was tending a crop of wheat in a miniature space greenhouse when a ground controllers advised her the shuttle &apos;s docking was imminent . 
lucid &apos;s mission , the second of seven planned U.S. astronaut tours of duty of Mir , is the longest ever by a woman and a record for an American . 
the shuttle crew planned to hover 150 feet ( 46 metres ) from Mir before inching in towards the station &apos;s 6.5 feet ( two meters ) diameter docking port . 
Readdy will have to negotiate his way through the station &apos;s forest of delicate , electricity generating solar panels , including a newly installed panel that will hang 14 feet ( four metres ) from the shuttle &apos;s nose . 
a final nudge from the shuttle &apos;s manoeuvring jets will link the two spacecraft . 
Motors will then draw the craft together and seal the docking ports . 
if all goes according to plan , the hatches between the two craft will swing open at about 12 : 39 a.m. CDT ( 0539 GMT ) on Thursday . 
joining Readdy on Atlantis are pilot Terry Wilcutt and mission specialists John Blaha , Tom Akers , Jay apt and Carl Walz . 
Blaha , a 54-year-old former fighter pilot , will remain aboard Mir with Russian cosmonauts Valery Korzun and Alexander Kaleri until Atlantis returns in January to retrieve him . 
the two spacecraft , weighing 535,480 lbs ( 242,900 kg ) , will remain joined in space for five days while the astronauts transfer thousands of pounds of equipment and supplies to and from Mir . 
Atlantis is due to return home on Sept . 26 , ending lucid &apos;s record-breaking 188-day stay in space .
