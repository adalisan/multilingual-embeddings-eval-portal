stocks are expected to run out of momentum this week with investors focusing on a Federal Reserve policy meeting and a slew of economic data ending with Friday &apos;s January employment report . 
keeping investors on edge will be the central bank &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday to rule on interest rate policy . 
while Wall Street expects the committee to keep rates unchanged , FOMC meetings are usually cause for some apprehension among market players . 
the Dow Jones industrial average finished Friday down 10.77 points , or 0.16 percent , at 6,813.09 after back-to-back sessions of gains over 80 points . 
analysts attributed the decline Friday to profit-taking . 
the blue-chip index finished the week up 116.6 points . 
&quot; I think we could see a week of corrections , &quot; said Michael Metz , chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co . 
&quot; My guess is that the 6,900 area on the Dow will once again prove to be the height of the range , &quot; he said . 
Friday &apos;s January unemployment rate and nonfarm payrolls are the week &apos;s most eagerly awaited numbers , not least because they are closely watched by the Fed . 
&quot; It &apos;s important because ( Fed chairman Alan ) Greenspan watches it , &quot; said Roy Blumberg , chief investment strategist at Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross . 
&quot; No one gave a darn about the Employment Cost Index until they learned Greenspan watches it . 
and any Fed chairman will be watching employment data . 
but he said that the effect of the data would be limited to Friday . 
&quot; These numbers are good for a day &apos;s worth of action , unless they are unbelievably off expectations , &quot; he said . 
Blumberg said he doubted the FOMC would take any action on interest rates . 
&quot; But with every meeting the odds increase that it will raise rates at the next one , &quot; he added . 
&quot; The economy is a bit stronger than expected . 
on Friday the government reported the nation &apos;s gross domestic product expanded at a robust 4.7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter . 
the GDP number was above Wall Street economists &apos; expectations of a 3.9 percent annual rate . 
not all analysts , however , agreed the market would move lower this week . 
Hildegard Zagorski , an analyst at prudential Securities , said she expected stocks to move higher with occasional shakeouts . 
Phil Orlando , chief investment strategist of Value Line &apos;s Asset Management division , said last week &apos;s round of data has given the market a positive tone . 
&quot; What changed last week is that we got data that confirmed that the moderate growth and benign inflation thesis is accurate , &quot; Orlando said . 
other data this week include the January National Association of Purchasing Management Index due on Monday , and December new home sales and leading indicators due on Tuesday .
