IPE May gas oil was called to open unchanged to 50 cents higher on Tuesday , drawing support from stronger NYMEX heating oil , brokers said . 
after the gas oil close at $ 165 a tonne on Monday , May Brent came off session highs to close at $ 18.17 a barrel , up 29 cents . 
&quot; Brent was a bit weaker towards the end but the gas oil call is partly on the strength of heat ... it &apos;s a dollar up against the arb but a dollar down against the crack , &quot; said one broker . 
may Brent was expected to open a few cents weaker in line with a weakening of cash intermonth spreads and the bid / offer range on SIMEX . 
the Brent May / June paper spread traded at -25 cents in the U.S. aftermarket on Monday compared to a settlement of -15 cents on the IPE . 
&quot; We &apos;ll see it coming off a bit , the spread should open around the -20 / -21 mark , &quot; a brokers said . 
the May Brent loading programme released on Tuesday morning scheduled the equivalent of 41.8 cargoes , or two full 500,000 barrel cargoes more than the revised April programme . 
traders said the higher programme was due to the longer month and a slightly lighter maintenance schedule on the Brent system than in April . 
the May IPE Brent contract expires at the close on business on Tuesday . 
Brent has been supported in the last few days by heightening tensions between the West and Iran . 
traders said that Monday &apos;s move upwards was triggered in part by a report in Sunday &apos;s Washington Post that U.S. and Saudi intelligence authorities have linked a senior Iranian government official to a group of Shiite Moslems suspected of bombing a US military compound in Saudi Arabia last year .
