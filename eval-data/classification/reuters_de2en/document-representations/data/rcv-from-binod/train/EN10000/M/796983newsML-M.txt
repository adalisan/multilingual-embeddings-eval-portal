Indian call money ended Wednesday at 8.75-9.0 percent , up from the day &apos;s opening 7.25-7.75 on late demand from banks , dealers said . 
they said call money which was traded at 7.0-7.5 for most of the day , rose in late afternoon on panic borrowing from a few banks which had uncovered positions . 
&quot; Some banks were slightly desperate in the afternoon as today is the last day before reporting to the central bank , &quot; said a public sector bank dealer . 
&quot; Some stray deals took place even at 10 percent but these rates are not indicative of the market conditions . 
banks report their positions to the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) on alternate Fridays . 
this fortnight , they report on Thursday as banks across the country are closed on Friday for independence Day . 
dealers said they expect call money to open at 5.0-6.0 percent . 
government securities were steady to slightly down in brisk trade but most of the deals were in two stocks , dealers said . 
&quot; The 11.19 percent 2005 and 12.59 percent 2004 continue to be the star attractions , &quot; said a dealer . 
&quot; Most other stocks were steady .... trade was quiet . 
dealers said prices fell slightly in the afternoon when some banks sold stocks after call money rose from the morning &apos;s levels . 
the 12.59 percent 2004 ended at 107 rupees , off the day &apos;s high of 107.25 . 
it ended Tuesday at 107 . 
the 11.19 percent 2005 ended steady at 100.50 . 
the 10,85 percent 2001 slipped to 100.65 from Tuesday &apos;s 100.70-100.73 .
