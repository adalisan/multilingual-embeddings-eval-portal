Ukrainian consumer prices will rise by no more than 17 percent in 1997 after inflating by 39.7 percent last year , Viktor Kalnyk , a deputy economy minister , said on Wednesday . 
&quot; It &apos;s already clear annual inflation this year will not be 25 percent as we previously forecast , and we now estimate it will be no more than 17 percent in 1997 , &quot; Kalnyk told Reuters . 
Kalnyk said inflation would be about 2.5 percent in August or September , once Ukraine &apos;s regions begin charging full prices for communal services such as living quarters . 
many areas are charging only 80 percent of the cost . 
Ukraine &apos;s 1997 draft budget , due to be debated in its third and final reading on Thursday , forecasts 25 percent annual inflation . 
economy Minister Yuri Yekhanurov said last week inflation in the first half of the year would be no more than six percent . 
January-May inflation was 5.2 percent , the Statistics Ministry said . 
Ukraine &apos;s inflation rate reached 10,000 percent in 1993 , two years after the country broke away from the Soviet Union and was plunged into an economic crisis .
