China &apos;s securities watchdog , the China Securities Regulatory Commission ( CSRC ) , said on Friday that Zhou Zhengqing , chairman of the Securities Commission of the State Council , has taken over as head of the CSRC . 
&quot; Zhou Zhengqing has formally taken over the additional duties as chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission , &quot; a CSRC spokeswoman told Reuters . 
Zhou Daojiong had been serving as the head of the CSRC but securities industry sources have said he was replaced in a move to rein in the nation &apos;s unruly stock markets . 
the CSRC did not give any indication of what job Zhou Daojiong would have in future . 
officials of the People &apos;s Bank of China said Chen Yaoxian had stepped down from his job as deputy governor of the central bank to take up the two posts of vice chairman of the Securities Commission of the State Council ( cabinet ) and deputy chief of the CSRC . 
Zhou Daojiong has also been vice chairman of the Securities Commission . 
there was no word on whether he had been formally removed from that post . 
the CSRC spokeswoman also said Fan Fuchun , currently head of the CSRC &apos;s listing department , and Chen Dongzheng would become deputy chiefs of the watchdog body . 
Chen &apos;s current position was not immediately known . 
the confirmation of the top personnel changes in the securities regulatory sector came as authorities announced a series of tough measures aimed at checking speculation on the nation &apos;s stock market . 
China &apos;s economic policy-makers have been eager to limit risk to the financial system by stopping the flow of bank credits to the stock market . 
they have been worried that a sharp downturn in stock prices could lead to heavy losses or even insolvencies at state-run banks , already burdened by heavy debts to ailing state industry . 
China has no deposit insurance system . 
late on Thursday , China announced that it had dismissed the head of the Shanghai branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for funding stock market trades . 
it also sacked the head of the Shenzhen Development Bank , the nation &apos;s only listed bank , saying the financial institution had been buying its own shares . 
it seized 90.34 million yuan ( $ 10.88 million ) in illegal trading profits from the bank . 
top officials of three major brokerage houses were also ousted as part of the sweeping policy move . 
all three companies were barred from trading on their own account for one year .
