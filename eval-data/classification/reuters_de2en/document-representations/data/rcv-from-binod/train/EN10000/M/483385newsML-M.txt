South Korea &apos;s bunker fuel oil sales are expected to reach 10 million tonnes in 1997 , with a 3.8 percent growth in foreign demand , an executive of Hyundai Oil refinery Co said on Wednesday . 
of the total , sales to foreign flag vessels are expected to rise by 200,000 tonnes to 5.5 million tonnes , Pyeong Yoon , manager of Hyundai &apos;s international trading team , told the two-day Singapore International bunkering Conference . 
Singapore &apos;s bunker market is facing stormy seas as it struggles to maintain a hold on shippers increasingly preferring to refuel in South Korea and the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) . 
noting better bunker quality and attractive prices , many Chinese buyers have turned to South Korea from Singapore , Asia &apos;s premier refuelling port . 
&quot; In 1996 , 16.9 million tonnes of bunker was lifted by vessels calling at the Port of Singapore , &quot; John Chen , Singapore Minister of State for Communications , said in his opening address to the conference . 
&quot; We should however not only be satisfied by the high volume of bunker lifted , &quot; Chen said , stressing the importance of quality fuel in Singapore maintaining its lead . 
&quot; Singapore strives to distinguish itself as a reliable bunkering port , where cheating is not tolerable , &quot; Chen said . 
bunker fuel oil consumption in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow 3.8 percent a year between 1995 and 2000 and 3.4 percent from 2000 to 2005 , according to a forecast by Fereidun Fesharaki of Hawaii &apos;s East-West Center . 
but major oil and independent bunker traders say that growth would be outside Singapore , whose 1997 bunker sales volume in 1997 is expected to slip by 3.0 percent after a similar decrease in 1996 . 
by comparison , South Korean bunker sales volume grew by 13 percent in 1996 . 
Yoon noted South Korea &apos;s growing refining capacity , which grew by 620,000 barrels per day to 2.52 million barrels in 1996 from a year ago and expanded its bunker supplies . 
&quot; Korea refiners uplifted flexibilities of inventory maintenance , in result , they raised adaptability against change in demand , &quot; Yoon said .
