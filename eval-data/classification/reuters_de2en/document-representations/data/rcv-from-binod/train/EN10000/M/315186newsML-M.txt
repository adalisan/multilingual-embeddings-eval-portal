Dutch shares squeezed to their third consecutive record high close on Friday , with volume stoked up by the biggest options turnover on record . 
dealers said buying in the cash market to cover options positions , combined with an overnight Wall Street gain and a surging dollar had pushed shares from the outset , although profit-taking late in the afternoon pared back gains . 
the AEX closed at 670.08 , extending Thursday &apos;s 7.88 point gain by a wafer-thin 0.53 points . 
earlier business swept the index to an all-time high of 673.36 , over 670 for the first time and comfortably above the 669.57 peak set on Thursday . 
volume on the options exchange soared to 380,000 contracts on Friday , reflecting the monthly options expirations . 
dealers said some in the market had been caught out by the New Year rally and were covering bearish index option positions . 
other dealers said new &quot; click fund &quot; options deals done by Dutch securities houses were expiring in favour of holders and writers were also scrambling to cover their exposure , helping turnover to beat the 352,000 daily record set last October . 
a click fund offers a secure return linked to gains in the AEX , which many analysts had anticipated would show only modest gains early in 1997 after the surge of 1996 . 
the AEX began last month at 631 , finishing 1996 at 648 , after a powerful rise of over 30 percent on 1995 , leading analysts to conclude early 1997 could see consolidation . 
&quot; I think the gains in the New Year , based on Wall Street and the dollar , have been a bit of a surprise to some , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think anyone really knows what &apos;s going to happen next week once the expirations are out of the way . 
the index has set five new closing highs since the year began , and is now hovering close to some analysts &apos; targets for the year . 
the year-end target range of analysts polled last year by Reuters saw the AEX at 578 to 687 .
