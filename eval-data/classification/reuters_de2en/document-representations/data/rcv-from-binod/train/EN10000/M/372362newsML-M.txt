gasoline extended its gains amid good buying support and tight supplies while naphtha resisted crude &apos;s downward trend , traders said on Wednesday . 
&quot; It is still quite tight in February ... March may be getting tighter , &quot; said a major of gasoline . 
both a Swiss trader and a European major emerged as buyers to conclude deals later Wednesday with , respectively , a Japanese trader and another European major at $ 27.20 per barrel fob Singapore for 92-octane and at $ 28.30 for 97-octane cargoes lifting end February-early March . 
unleaded 92-octane gasoline had been bid at $ 27.00 in late Tuesday trade while 97-octane had been bid at $ 28.00 / $ 28.20 . 
but traders said they would look to India &apos;s tender to buy 100,000 tonnes of 87-octane leaded gasoline to be delivered March 1-15 . 
the tender closes Wednesday . 
Naphtha remained steady despite crude &apos;s fall . 
&quot; It &apos;s quite tight , &quot; said a trader . 
&quot; If you look at paper , it is much stronger eventhough crude fell by nearly 30 cents . 
Naphtha March swaps rose 20 cents per barrel to $ 23.70 / $ 23.90 . 
reflecting the slightly more bullish fundamentals India awarded its Bombay low aromatic naphtha ( LAN ) tender lifting February 20-22 at $ 23.00 per tonne below Japanese quotes fob , compared to the lower discount it sold its last LAN cargo which lifted January 29-31 at $ 25.38 . 
India offered a Cochin high aromatic cargo lifting March 1-3 in a tender closing February 20 and valid until the 21 .
