Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui has accused China of &quot; senseless repression &quot; and said his island would continue to seek international recognition despite losing its biggest ally , South Africa , to Beijing . 
Lee , commenting for the first time on Pretoria &apos;s plan to switch diplomatic ties from Taipei to Beijing by the end of 1997 , said Taiwan &apos;s exiled Republic of China government would not buckle under Beijing pressure . 
&quot; Although the Republic of China has suffered from communist China &apos;s senseless repression diplomatically , we will never set limits for ourselves , &quot; Lee said in an address made late on Friday and carried by state television on Saturday . 
&quot; We will continue to participate in international affairs according to the ideal of promoting our country &apos;s development and existence , &quot; he said . 
seeking to limit damage from the Pretoria move , Taipei has advanced a trip by Foreign Minister John Chang to South Africa . 
the trip , scheduled for January , will begin on Monday . 
&quot; Aside from negotiating with South Africa &apos;s high-level government officials concerning bilateral relations , ( Chang ) also will examine all the projects in Pretoria involving cooperation with Taiwan , &quot; foreign ministry spokesman Peter Cheng told reporters on Saturday . 
the ministry said Chang would meet his Pretoria counterpart , Alfred Nzo , during the five-day visit but it was uncertain whether Chang would hold talks with South African President Nelson Mandela . 
Mandela &apos;s announcement on Wednesday to switch ties was the biggest blow to Taipei &apos;s ongoing efforts to break out of a Beijing-imposed isolation since South Korea changed recognition to China in 1992 . 
China has regarded Taiwan a renegade province not entitled to international recognition since the two split after a civil war in 1949 . 
Beijing , which has threatens to attack Taiwan if it tries to declare independence , intensified its containment policy after Lee made a private , but high-profile , visit to the United States in 1995 . 
China mounted intimidating war games in waters near Taiwan in the months leading up to the island &apos;s March presidential election , which Lee won in a landslide , and has stepped up pressure on diplomatic allies of Taiwan to switch allegiance . 
South Africa is the biggest of only 30 countries -- mostly underdeveloped states in central America and Africa -- that recognise Taiwan rather than the communist People &apos;s Republic on the mainland . 
Taipei has blamed its fallout with Pretoria on Beijing and said it would not launch further steps to boost economic ties with China . 
some 25,000 Taiwan businesses have poured over US $ 20 billion into the Chinese mainland , making Taiwan one of the leading overseas investors in China despite political impasse between the two rivals . 
Taiwan also has said it will stop encouraging investment in South Africa and re-evaluate economic loans and aid previously made for diplomatic purposes . 
nearly 300 Taiwan businesses have operations in South Africa with investments topping US $ 1.5 billion .
