&quot; Nothing is happening on bills , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; We have a skeleton staff . 
Canada &apos;s three-month when-issued T-bill traded steady at a yield of 2.89 percent from the close of trading on Friday . 
the bond market in Canada will close early today at 1400 est / 1900 GMT , while U.S. treasuries were closed for the Veterans Day holiday . 
with the banks shut , there was no overnight market for call loan trading .
