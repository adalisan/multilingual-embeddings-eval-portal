Philippines Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon said Wednesday the U.N. Law of the Sea convention should be firmly upheld to ensure rival maritime claims were not settled by force . 
in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly , he said a potential threat to global and regional peace and security had been the &quot; developing scramble for jurisdiction , resources and strategic positions &quot; in the world &apos;s oceans . 
&quot; This has been prominently evident in the situation in the South China Sea , which for the most part is surrounded by South East Asian states , &quot; he said . 
although Siazon did not mention any specific dispute , the Philippines , China , Vietnam , Malaysia , Brunei and Taiwan have all laid partial or total claim to the Spratly Islands , which are believed to hold rich oil and gas reserves . 
in the East China Sea , China and Japan are in dispute over islands called the Diaoyus in Chinese and Senkakus in Japanese . 
Siazon said the international community had fortunately agreed on a set of rules governing the use of the sea , primarily the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea ( UNCLOS ) . 
this was concluded in 1982 and entered into force in 1994 . 
&quot; Not least , UNCLOS subjects maritime jurisdictions to the rule of law , defining the nature and limits of those jurisdictions and providing the legal framework for their establishment and for negotiating a settlement where they overlap , &quot; he added . 
the rule of law , as enshrined principally in UNCLOS , &quot; has to be upheld with determination and vigilance so that the assertion of jurisdiction over the world &apos;s seas are governed by law rather than by the use of superior force , &quot; Siazon said .
