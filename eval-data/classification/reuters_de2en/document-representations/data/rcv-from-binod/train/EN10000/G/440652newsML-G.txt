the radical Palestinian Alliance called on Thursday for confrontation with Israel to stop plans to build Jewish homes in Arab East Jerusalem . 
&quot; The Alliance , while warning of the dangers of this aggressive Zionist policy and calling for the widest confrontation , holds the Oslo traitors ( Palestinian self-rule Authority ) responsible for the loss of Palestine , &quot; it said in a statement . 
the Damascus-based group also condemned the U.S. veto of a resolution in the United Nations Security Council opposing the Israeli plans and said international criticism was not enough . 
it said the U.S. position showed &quot; flagrant bias in favour of the Zionist enemy &quot; . 
the Alliance , grouping secular and Islamic factions , has claimed responsibility for several suicide bombings in Israel .
