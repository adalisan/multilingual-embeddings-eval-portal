Zaire &apos;s President Mobutu Sese Seko , who is expected in Morocco soon , has an estimated $ 10 million of construction underway in the southern city of Marrakesh , a Moroccan real estate agent said on Friday .

&quot; Mobutu owns , with a Swiss partner , a five-storey building and luxury restaurant under construction in Marrakesh worth $ 10 million , &quot; the real estate agent said . 
he said the building and restaurant are on Mohamed V boulevard , the city &apos;s main avenue . 
the construction of both units was recently suspended after a dispute between Mobutu and his Swiss associate , he added . 
he gave no other details . 
official were immediately available for comment . 
in Switzerland , authorities ordered a freeze on Friday on Mobutu &apos;s villa but not his other assets , estimated to total $ 4 billion . 
Mobutu , fighting cancer and seven months of civil war , left his capital on Friday for his northern jungle palace at Gbadolite on doctors &apos; orders , state television said . 
but an official statement later said he was giving up power , although retaining the title of president .
