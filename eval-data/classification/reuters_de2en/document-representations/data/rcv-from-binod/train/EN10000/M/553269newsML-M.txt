Indian global depositary receipts were mildly lower in slow Thursday trade amid limited interest following a local market holiday , traders said . 
they said the market was expected to drift in the near term amid a lack of fresh factors , although support at current levels was likely on the back of the expected passing of the 1997 / 8 budget next week and the reappointment of P. Chidambaram as finance minister . 
&quot; Today was a nothing day , &quot; a broker said . 
reliance shed 17 cents to $ 19.50 / $ 20.00 and VSNL was two cents softer at $ 19.40 / 19.90 . 
holidays in Korea and Taiwan also kept volumes down in related GDRs . 
the Capel Taiwan GDR Index added 0.15 points to 125.64 , representing a discount to the local market of 2.53 percent . 
the Capel Korea GDR Index shed 0.74 points to 61.06 points , a premium of 24.57 percent over the local market .
