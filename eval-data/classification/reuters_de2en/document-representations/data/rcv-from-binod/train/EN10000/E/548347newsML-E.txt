the Argentine embassy here said on Monday that the U.S. Department of Commmerce had decided to revoke countervailing duties on imported Argentine wool , hides , seamless steel tubes and rolled steel . 
department of Commerce spokespeople could not be immediately reached for comment . 
the embassy said in a news release that the Department of Commerce had been reviewing its sanctions since last year , at Argentina &apos;s request . 
the Argentine argument against the sanctions was based on a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia involving Mexican imports . 
that judicial decision voided countervailing duties on Mexican ceramic products , finding that the Deparment of Commerce had no authority to impose sanctions before establishing that such imports hurt U.S. producers . 
according to the embassy , the department &apos;s review found similarities in the cases of the Argentine products and the Mexican imports , and decided to lift the sanctions . 
the news release added that this decision would &quot; help the visit U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley plans to make to Buenos Aires between May 15 and 17 .
