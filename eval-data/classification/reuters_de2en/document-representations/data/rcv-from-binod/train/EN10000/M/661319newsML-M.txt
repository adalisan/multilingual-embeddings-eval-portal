Taiwan share prices closed higher on Friday , boosted by Wall Street &apos;s big bull run and a renewed rise in the recently volatile electronics sector , brokers said . 
the index ended up 55.74 points or 0.67 percent at 8,315.02 , off an intraday high of 8,355.87 . 
taking momentum from Wall Street &apos;s record rise , financials surged as much as 1.53 percent as a sector but settled for a 0.56 percent rise as buying slowed in late trade , brokers said . 
&quot; Financials led the opening gains when electronics fell , but when electronics turned upward , buying shifted to electronics from financials , &quot; said HSBC James Capel analyst Alex Chen . 
electronics ended the day 1.08 percent higher as a sector , as market bellwether Taiwan Semiconductor added to Thursday &apos;s bold limit-up showing by surging T $ 5 to T $ 96 . 
electronics got off to a slow start because institutional investors dumped semiconductor shares on Thursday , but found upward momentum despite institutional jitters , brokers said . 
&quot; Despite institutional selling on electronics , investors still find the sector with the best outlook , &quot; Chen said . 
Chen said upstream semiconductor and packaging firms should enjoy high profit growth in the third quarter while the downstream notebook computer , monitor and scanner makers likely would perform strongly in the fourth quarter . 
China-concept shares -- Taiwan firms with active or planned investments in the communist mainland -- rose again to reflect recent big gains by Hong Kong &apos;s China-linked shares ahead of the British colony &apos;s July 1 handover to Beijing . 
Hong Kong &apos;s China-linked shares encountered profit-taking in recent sessions , but Chen said Taiwan &apos;s China-concept shares remained as one of the market &apos;s trendsetting sectors .
