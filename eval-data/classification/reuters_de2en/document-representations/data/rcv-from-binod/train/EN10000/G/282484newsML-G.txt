Israeli President Ezer Weizman this week visits the southwestern Indian city of Cochin , home to the oldest synagogue in India , built in 1568 , and to one of the more exotic branches of the Jewish diaspora . 
by the last count , Weizman will find only 18 Jews living there , ageing remnants of a once flourishing mercantile community that set up in this centre of the spice trade after fleeing persecution in Europe during the Spanish Inquisition . 
he visits the town on January 2 . 
just 6,000 to 8,000 Jews still cling to their faith in India , a country of 930 million people , 83 percent Hindu and 12 percent Moslem . 
and although older generations of Jews have made a name in various professions , particularly in the military , today &apos;s Jewish youth encounter reactions to their faith that range from ignorance to curiosity . 
&quot; Some of my school friends say &apos; you &apos;re Jewish , what &apos;s that ? 
&apos; &quot; Rachel Judah Hyam , a 20-year-old student at Delhi University , told Reuters . 
the small population represents a Jewish ancestry in the country that some historians trace back to around 2,000 years . 
the first established community is believed by some to have come ashore in the southwestern state of Kerala before AD 70 , and may even have been the destination for St. Thomas when he brought Christianity to India in AD 52 . 
another group was later shipwrecked and scattered among the villages of the Konkan coastal strip south of Bombay , also on the western coast . 
the descendants of these ancient settlers are known as the Bene-Israel -- children of Israel -- who some historians believe are one of the 10 biblical lost tribes of the Kingdom of Israel . 
arriving bereft of their scriptures , the Jews kept alive their faith by word of mouth , passed down from generation to generation . 
they inter-married and took menial farm jobs permitted to them under the Hindu caste system , and became so assimilated that it took refugees from Spain &apos;s Christian fundamentalism centuries later to identify them , through a surviving prayer and food laws , as fellow Jews . 
to add to the mix , in the 19th century the Baghdadi Jews -- who , despite their name , came from all over the Middle East -- pitched up in Bombay and Calcutta . 
while India &apos;s history has been scarred by fractious relations between religious groups , the Jews were quickly accepted and were never persecuted here . 
&quot; It is very normal . 
we don &apos;t feel any different . 
it is like any other religion , &quot; said one young girl in the congregation at the Judah Hyam synagogue , the only one in the Indian capital . 
even the Arab-Israeli conflict barely affected the Jews &apos; relations with India &apos;s Moslem community , the world &apos;s second largest outside Indonesia . 
&quot; Each side left the other alone . 
the battle was being fought out there in Israel , &quot; Nissim Ezekiel , a venerable and celebrated Indian poet and a Bombay Jew , told Reuters . 
Colonel Oliver Judah Hyam , of the Indian Army , whose brother was in the Israeli army , read the 23rd psalm during the Friday night service at the New Delhi synagogue , founded by his grandfather in 1956 . 
there were fewer than 20 compatriots there to listen , but the turnout was doubled by Jewish American and Australian tourists . 
usually the synagogue , which Israeli leader Shimon Peres visited in 1993 as foreign minister , struggles to get the 10 adult males required to conduct formal prayers , locals said . 
there are only 15 to 20 Jewish families left in Delhi , according to Yehoshua Benjamin of the Jewish Welfare Association , and the last wedding was held in the synagogue three years ago . 
today there are more Indian Jews living in Israel than in India . 
just before India won independence from Britain in 1947 , the Jewish population numbered around 35,000 , mainly centred in Bombay , where more than 4,500 still live . 
but the pull of a Jewish homeland after Israel was founded in 1948 and better economic prospects persuaded most Indian Jews to uproot themselves . 
not all of them packed their bags for Israel . 
some chose the United States , Canada and Britain for their new lives . 
but the exodus of Jews to Israel has slowed considerably . 
the Jewish Agency in Bombay put the number of emigrants in 1996 at 50 , compared with 150 in 1995 . 
as in Cochin , some communities are dying out . 
marrying within the faith and staying in India will clearly be even harder for young Jews here , an Israeli diplomat said . 
but in one or two pockets , notably in the northern Bombay suburb of Dombvili and the nearby town of Thane , Jewish communities are trying to re-create their group identity . 
Ezekiel Malekar , a Jewish community leader in New Delhi , is confident India will always have its Jews . 
&quot; I love Israel with my heart , but my blood is Indian ... We will always keep the light of Judaism burning here .
