&quot; Faction , &quot; is the obvious answer . 
but not in the Liberal party . 
faction is a naughty Labor party word . 
the Liberal answer is &quot; forum . 
John Howard , for one , has always decried Labor &apos;s factions , frequently boasting of the Liberal party &apos;s &quot; broad church &quot; in which each voice has equal force . 
factions or forums , the Liberal party now has two of them . 
the Lyons forum , formed when the Liberal-National coalition was in opposition is a conservative , god-fearing group . 
it took the name of Joe Lyons , a former Labor &quot; rat &quot; , to use that party &apos;s idiom , who after defecting from Labor became a founding member of the United Australia Party , the Liberals &apos; forerunner . 
the forum &apos;s founder , Victorian backbencher Kevin Andrews ( he of the private member &apos;s bill aimed at overturning the Northern Territory &apos;s pro-euthanasia law ) recently claimed a membership covering 50 percent of the current parliamentary Liberal party , including the prime minister . 
this week the Lyons group was countered by Liberal moderates Chris Gallus , Joe Hockey and Susan Jeanes who wrote to colleagues : &quot; As forums seem to be all the rage , it would seem opportune that we institute a forum to further cause of liberalism , &quot; it said . 
the rest of the letter didn &apos;t inspire confidence , mispelling the name of the 19th century philosopher and the economist , John Stuart Mill ( or John Stewart Mill , according to the forum &apos;s sponsors ) from whom they are taking their name . 
the increasingly bitter struggle over euthanasia was the catalyst for the formation of the new faction , but it was inevitable . 
while vigourously denying the &apos; faction &apos; tag , the Lyons group has been acting just like one : meeting regularly , even undertaking independent research to support submissions to cabinet on sensitive issues . 
Andrews has been quite open in claiming victory on the coalition &apos;s family tax package , the centrepiece of the August budget . 
the Gallus group couldn &apos;t let the Lyons forum to continue to dominate the coalition &apos;s agenda without putting another well-organised point of view . 
their fear was that the Lyons group would progressively edge the coalition further to the right , freezing out the small-l liberals . 
if that sounds like factionalism , it is . 
this is just what Howard didn &apos;t want . 
his pre-election pitch was heavily weighted towards distinguishing the coalition from Labor and nothing is more redolent of Labor than the factions . 
but like it or not , Howard now has them . 
the formation of the John Stuart Mill group is at least as important a political development as was the setting up of Labor &apos;s centre-left faction in the 1980s largely under the influence of former leader , Bill Hayden . 
another of Howard &apos;s campaign shibboleths is also looking shaky after this week &apos;s parliamentary sittings . 
standards -- ministerial and parliamentary -- were going to improve under Howard . 
at the centre of this promise was his Guide to Ministerial Conduct , setting higher the bar of ministerial propriety . 
Liberal polling showed it was a clear vote winner , the public being sick of the parliamentary antics of Paul Keating and his front bench and derisive about decisions like that which saw Carmen Lawrence cling to her ministerial post despite the findings of a royal commission that she had lied . 
but this week opposition finance spokesman Nick Sherry revealed Assistant Treasurer Jim Short had a holding of 6,679 Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd shares . 
as Sherry pointed out , Short , while a shareholder , was looking after some sensitive banking issues under his portfolio , such as the Wallis inquiry and the introduction of Retirement Savings Accounts -- for banks , the competitive answer to the superannuation groups . 
the latter is regarded as one of the prime underpinnings to the 23 per cent increase in the ANZ Bank &apos;s share price since the Howard government came to power . 
extraordinarily , at no stage in the past seven months did it occur to Short that his shareholding might breach the prime minister &apos;s guide to ministerial conduct . 
not even when Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron ran into trouble by continuing his medical practice until Howard put an end to it . 
not even when Resources and Energy Minister Warwick Parer found himself in conflict by holding mining shares and quickly divested himself 
not even when Primary Industries Minister John Anderson divested himself of Boral shares after a row over Boral &apos;s involvement in forestry . 
short &apos;s defence was weak and halting . 
he claimed he didn &apos;t read the &quot; fine print &quot; of the ministerial guide . 
there is no fine print . 
it &apos;s all there in large type . 
&quot; Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares ... in any company or business involved in their portfolio responsibilities . 
Howard &apos;s explanation of why he didn &apos;t sack the Assistant Treasurer wasn &apos;t much better . 
he said Short didn &apos;t do anything deliberately dishonest while conceding he breached guidelines . 
Labor was in full flight . 
Kim Beazley and Simon Crean had their best day in parliament since the election . 
they needed it because there haven &apos;t been many . 
John Howard has been reduced by the issue in terms of leadership strength and his desire to be a politician of higher standards .
