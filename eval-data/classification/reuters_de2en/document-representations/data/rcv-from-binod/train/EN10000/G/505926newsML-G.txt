Croatian President Franjo Tudjman &apos;s nationalist party defeated an opposition coalition by a razor-thin margin in key elections for the city assembly of the capital Zagreb , unofficial final returns showed on Monday . 
Croatia held municipal and county elections on Sunday and former rebel Serbs took part for the first time . 
but voting in the enclave of Eastern Slavonia was delayed by technical problems which U.N. officials blamed on the Zagreb government . 
Serbs in Eastern Slavonia , to be reintegrated in Croatia this summer after a period as a U.N. protectorate , were given an extra day to vote on Monday to compensate for organisational bungling that shut down balloting for hours on Sunday . 
transitional Authority ) is very disappointed with the inadequate and incomplete support of the Croatian side in these elections , &quot; mission spokesman Philip Arnold told a news conference on Monday in the enclave &apos;s main town Vukovar . 
&quot; We were deeply disappointed with the administrative breakdown yesterday -- the fact that packages of ballots were misdirected and voting lists were not corrected . 
Zagreb had also not provided enough ballot forms but an extra 110,000 arrived on Monday to make up the shortfall . 
Serbs could also now vote even if their names were absent from lists as long as they produced Croatian citizenship cards . 
minority Serbs seized the region in a 1991 revolt against Croatia &apos;s secession from Serbian-led federal Yugoslavia but agreed to &quot; peaceful reintegration &quot; after the Croatian army recaptured two other breakaway enclaves in 1995 . 
Western officials said a clean election was crucial to secure Serb minority rights through local assemblies and persuade an apprehensive population that it would be safe under restored Croatian authority . 
pre-election polls had suggested that the Social Democrats and Social Liberals , riding economic grievances , could upset the ruling Croatian Democratic Union ( HDZ ) in some big cities . 
but with all polling stations counted in Zagreb , the HDZ emerged the largest single vote getter at 34.9 percent to 34.5 for a bloc of Social Democrats ( SDP ) , who tallied 23.9 percent , and the centrist Social Liberals ( HSLS ) with 10.5 . 
the result seemed enough for the HDZ to retain power , possibly by luring small conservative parties like the HSS into an alliance for a viable majority . 
the HSS rejected a coalition with Social Democrats because of their communist past . 
Zagreb was the grand prize in the elections since it has a third of Croatia &apos;s population , half the industrial economy , a major chunk of taxation and a powerful patronage machine . 
in another photo finish , the HDZ upset the incumbent Social Liberal administration in the eastern city of Osijek , Croatia &apos;s fourth biggest , by .07 percent but fell short of a majority . 
Tudjman &apos;s party crashed to 28 percent and deadlock with centre-left parties in Croatia &apos;s biggest port , Split , and was thrashed by a liberal bloc in the second biggest coastal city , Rijeka , and the nearby county of Istria . 
unofficial returns on voting for 21 county assemblies showed the HDZ cruising to easy re-election in almost all , including Zagreb &apos;s conservative rural hinterland . 
in Zagreb , the SDP improved on its 18.6 percent performance in 1995 but the HSLS , weakened by leadership squabbles , slipped from 13 percent , dashing their hope of a decisive joint victory over the nationalists on Sunday . 
but Tudjman vetoed four opposition mayoral nominees on &quot; national security &quot; grounds and imposed provisional HDZ rule . 
his manoeuvre brought accusations of authoritarianism and was condemned in the West . 
Tudjman argued the HDZ had won a &quot; relative majority &quot; while the opposition was an unstable mishmash of parties ranging from far left to far right . 
diplomats say Croatia must demonstrate an unequivocal commitment to pluralism or it will have a hard time qualifying for coveted links with the European Union . 
Tudjman , a former communist general , led Croatia in a successful 1991 war for independence from Serbian-led federal Yugoslavia . 
the HDZ relied heavily on his enduring charisma as &quot; Father of the Nation &quot; in the latest election campaign . 
the state party &apos;s popularity has slipped to the 25-35 percent range since 1995 over corruption and insensitivity to Croats who have fallen on financial hard times as the formerly socialist economy has been privatised .
