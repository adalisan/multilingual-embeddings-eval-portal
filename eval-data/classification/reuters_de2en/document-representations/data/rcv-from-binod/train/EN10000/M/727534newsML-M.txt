Shanghai copper futures ended down on Monday on weak market sentiment , traders said . 
the most actively traded November 1997 contract ended at 20,350 yuan ( $ 2,451 ) per tonne , losing 250 yuan . 
it opened at an intraday high of 20,740 and hit a low of 20,300 yuan per tonne . 
July fell 50 to 21,400 , August fell 150 to 20,300 , September 200 to 20,300 , October 230 to 20,350 , December 260 to 20,360 and the January 1998 contract 200 to 20,400 yuan per tonne . 
combined volume rose to 50,630 tonnes from 46,060 tonnes . 
copper opened mostly up but profit-taking and fresh selling pushed prices steadily down for most of the session . 
traders said many investors took advantage of gains on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) last Friday to build short positions and liquidate long positions at high levels , pushing the prices down . 
&quot; sentiment changed little despite Friday &apos;s LME gains and little buying emerged at high levels , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; Many investors believed copper would test the 20,000 yuan support level in the next few days on prevailing pessimistic mood , &quot; he said . 
LME copper closed the Friday afternoon kerb at $ 2,284 , and was seen testing interim resistance at $ 2,300 on Monday , ahead of Third Wednesday pricing . 
in the Shanghai area , physical prices were around 20,400 yuan per tonne , and had been steady in recent trading days as panic about further heavy losses disappeared , traders said . 
traders said copper was unlikely to fall sharply in the short term despite the prevailing weak sentiment . 
&quot; copper will keep steady around 20,000 yuan level to digest the sharp falls of the past few weeks , and it will rise slowly as the third quarter progresses , &quot; a second trader said . 
aluminium futures ended mostly up . 
July rose 70 yuan to 13,490 , August ended unchanged at 13,550 , September increased 140 to 13,790 , October gained 80 to 13,740 , and November put on 50 to 13,700 yuan per tonne .
