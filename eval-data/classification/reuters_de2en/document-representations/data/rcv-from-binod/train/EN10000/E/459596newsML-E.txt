a possible increase in U.S. interest rates could push the dollar higher , encourage foreign buying of U.S. fixed income securities and intensify export-driven growth in other industrial economies , a report by Goldman Sachs suggested . 
while an increase in interest rates would not take financial markets by surprise , there are some concerns that higher U.S. interest rates could damage non-U.S. financial asset performance , as seen in 1994 , Goldman said . 
an interest rates hike , however , would not likely rattle emerging markets as it did in 1994 , Goldman said . 
the increase in U.S. interest rates three years ago caused many investors to pull out of emerging markets . 
if the Federal Reserve raised rates , the effect on emerging markets would be less severe , since U.S.-based investment in foreign equities has been on a smaller scale than in the early 1990s , Goldman said . 
also , the recent investment in emerging markets has been directed to larger markets , where U.S. liquidity has a smaller relative impact , Goldman said . 
Goldman said a possible tightening by the Federal Reserve already is largely reflected in U.S. equities .
