the Australian share market edged just firmer by the close on Friday with mixed performances from the leaders ensuring the market failed to escape a nine-point range established early in the day . 
by the close , the All Ordinaries index added 2.3 points to 2,388.6 . 
with the US on thanksgiving holiday and local October balance payments data that passed barely noticed , the market went into pre-weekend mode with options-boosted turnover figures belying a modest day &apos;s activity . 
&quot; Very much a neutral sort of day . 
we had no lead from the U.S. on either bonds , equities or commodities , &quot; said a dealer at a Brisbane-based brokerage , pointing to a patchy performance from the majors that saw the broader market end virtually unchanged . 
&quot; Losses in a few stocks were offset by gains in the National Australia Bank while the heavy turnover was largely options-related . 
&quot; National Australia Bank was the standout in the leaders , &quot; the dealer said . 
other features remained elusive as traders awaited the reopening of the U.S. markets . 
rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about seven to six , while about 32 percent of shares traded remained steady .
