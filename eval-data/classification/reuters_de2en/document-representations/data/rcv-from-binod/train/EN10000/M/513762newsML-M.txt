Goldman , Sachs and Co Inc has revised its dollar forecasts higher , citing &quot; amazing &quot; U.S. economic strength and an &quot; odd &quot; absence of Japanese intervention to slow the greenback &apos;s rise . 
the dollar now is expected to fetch 1.80 marks and 130 yen in three months , the firm said in its latest edition of The Weekly analyst dated April 15 . 
&quot; We have revised our forecasts higher for the dollar over the next one and three months , although we have kept our six and 12 month forecasts basically unchanged , &quot; Goldman said . 
the investment bank said it upped its three-month projections from 1.71 marks and 121 yen . 
it also raised its dollar / yen forecast in the one-month horizon to 129 from 124 . 
two primary reasons were stated for the revisions , the first being &quot; the remarkable strength of domestic demand indicators in the U.S. &quot; 
&quot; The break of 125 yen , and the lack of immediate intervention to attempt to discourage ( dollar ) buyers is really quite remarkable , in view of the February G7 meeting and the huge number of statements that have followed from Japanese officials ever since , &quot; it continued . 
it stood at 125.74 / 84 yen , barely changed from 125.77 / 87 .
