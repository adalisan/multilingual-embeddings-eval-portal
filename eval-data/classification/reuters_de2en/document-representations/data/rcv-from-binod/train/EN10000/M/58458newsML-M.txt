- December T-bond futures could weaken further over the next two sessions but some technical analysts are not yet ready to shift to a bearish outlook . 
important support for the December contract exists between 108-06 / 32 and 108-00 , said Terence Gabriel , technical analyst with I.D.E.A. 
Inc . 
he recommends placing sell stops at 107-29 / 32 , in case that support doesn &apos;t hold . 
&quot; I &apos;m still a buyer on dips into this 108-06 area and I would use a break under 107-29 to suggest we &apos;d failed and could see renewed weakness back to 107-00 , &quot; he said . 
in the interim , the market remains trendless and well within recent ranges , he said . 
on a weekly chart , ADX readings measuring the degree of trend in a market are falling , which reinforces the view the market lacks clear direction , he said . 
Jack McIntyre , market strategist at MCM TradeWatch , agreed that current weakness does not indicate a bear trend . 
&quot; You &apos;d have to be very aggressive to sell into this weakness , given that the market has been rallying . 
if we were to close lower today , that might be a sign that the market does have a buy dip mentality , &quot; he said . 
in that case , short-term selling could be followed by a move back up to 109-00 , he said . 
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t turn outright bearish until we close , on the December contract , 107-25 to 107-18 which is sort of the top of the trading range we &apos;ve been in , &quot; he said . 
the prognosis for March eurodollar futures is slightly more negative , he said . 
&quot; The curve is flattening . 
the front end seems to be getting more beat-up than bonds , &quot; he observed . 
but the forecast for eurodollar futures won &apos;t become bearish until the contract trades below 93.84 , a major sell signal , he said . 
Gabriel said he expects the March contract to fall towards 93.81 , a view that is reinforced by a bearish daily candle pattern , he said . 
from there , he expects the contract to bounce higher . 
however , a move below that level could send the contract down to 93.63 , he said .
