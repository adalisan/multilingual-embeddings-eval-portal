Asia &apos;s stock markets are expected to face profit-taking pressure in the coming week as investors seek to cash in on recent strong share prices . 
but the region &apos;s bourses may be able to carry over enough momentum from last week to fight off the sellers , analysts said . 
a key factor will be the Dow Jones Industrial average , which notched an eighth consecutive record closing high on Friday in an ascent that has carried some Asian stock markets along with it . 
a correction is considered long overdue for the Dow and Asian bourses are expected to suffer when it comes . 
but should the Dow continue to climb , stock markets that have ridden its recent success , such as those in Hong Kong , Sydney and Singapore , are likely to see another week of strong gains , analysts said . 
Tokyo - Tokyo stocks are likely to struggle for direction in the coming week without any key economic indicators to lead the way , brokers said , with the Nikkei average expected to waver around the 21,000 level . 
they said when the benchmark dips , public and pension funds were likely to creak into action , preventing hard falls . 
on the other hand , profit-taking was likely to cap gains and the index will probably stay between 20,600 and 21,300 . 
&quot; Until November 27 , when the Bank of Japan &apos;s &apos; Tankan &apos; survey on business sentiment is released , there will be little to influence the market , &quot; a trader at a second-tier brokerage said . 
the Nikkei 225 average fell 101.31 points , or 0.48 percent , on Friday to 20,929.73 . 
it lost more than 270 points last week . 
Bangkok - The outlook for Thai shares depends on the outcome of this Sunday &apos;s general election , brokers said . 
&quot; Investors will keep a close eye on the results of the election . 
if the Democrat Party wins the most seats , share prices will certainly rises , &quot; said an analyst at SITCA Investment . 
the Democrats are seen as strong on economic issues . 
brokers said , however , the market could react negatively if the New aspiration Party , the other front-runner , is victorious . 
Colombo - Sri Lanka stocks , which closed up on positive investor sentiment , should rise further next week , brokers said . 
&quot; All things being equal , the all share should gain until the next round of profit-taking , &quot; said Prasanna Chandrasekera , a trader at brokerage John Kells . 
the index closed Friday at 632.13 , up 9.02 points or 1.4 percent from the close a week earlier at 623.11 . 
Dhaka - Bangladesh stocks recovered after a brief correction and resumed their rally , which brokers say is likely to continue in the week ahead with fresh funds pouring into the market . 
stocks rose late last week as investors squared their positions ahead of annual meetings of many listed companies due in the next month . 
the Dhaka Stock Exchange index gained 151.73 points to close at 3,567.27 in the week ending on Thursday . 
Hong Kong - Hong Kong stocks are expected to put on a brave face in the event of likely profit-taking in the coming week and that should allow the Hang Seng index to break more records , analysts said . 
&quot; I suspect we may see a little bit more profit-taking but I think it will be fairly shallow profit-taking , &quot; said Howard Gorges , director at South China brokerage . 
&quot; I would not be surprised by the end of the week if the market is back above 13,000 , &quot; he said . 
the Hang Seng index rose above the 13,000-point mark for the first time last week , although it closed down 115.43 points on Friday at 12,889.37 . 
despite Friday &apos;s loss , the blue-chip index rose 138.21 points , or 1.08 percent , last week . 
Jakarta - brokers said Indonesian shares were likely to be mixed in the coming week with some consolidation after big increases in some counters over the past couple of days . 
&quot; The market is likely to stabilise in the coming week with profit-taking in some blue-chips and banking stocks including Telkom , &quot; an analyst said . 
on Friday , the Jakarta composite Index closed at 616.89 points , against last week &apos;s close of 602.02 points . 
the index rose 12.56 points last week to close on Friday at 1192.16 . 
the Second Board index added 11.10 points throughout the week to close at 654.58 on Friday . 
&quot; There &apos;s a lot of pent-up demand . 
if they ( investors ) buy on the back of the relistings , the index should move up a few points , &quot; said Tony Shue , a trader at Jupiter Securities . 
Manila - Manila shares are seen range-trading in the coming week as the market awaits the release of favourable gross national product ( GNP ) figures and the summit meetings of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum , traders said . 
&quot; Consolidation slowed down this week and next week is a good time to accumulate due to the GNP results that will confirm the economy &apos;s strength as well as APEC which will boost sentiment , &quot; said Erwin Balita , analyst with Dharmala Securities Inc . 
the main index ended down 27.9 points , or 0.9 percent , at 3,062.10 on Friday from 3,090 a week earlier . 
Seoul - falling interest rates could boost institutional buying next week , but the overall market will remain under pressure from a high level of margin loans , brokers said . 
&quot; I see the market moving in a range between 720 and 760 next week . 
the 750-755 level will be a strong barrier against the market &apos;s turnaround , &quot; said Yoon Seok-yong of Daewoo Securities . 
the composite index closed at 750.29 on Friday , up 1.5 percent or 11.18 points from last Friday &apos;s 739.11 . 
Singapore - Dealers said they expect the Singapore stock market to see some profit-taking next week after this week &apos;s rally , which saw the key Straits Times Industrials index rise 76.41 points over the week to end on Friday at 2,193.64 . 
but dealers expect the market to remain firm . 
they said foreign funds have been buying the Singapore market on the belief that it has bottomed and a recovery in the electronics sector is in the cards . 
&quot; Much would also depend on whether anything happens on Wall Street . 
if there is no big correction , sentiment would remain firm , &quot; said another dealer . 
Sydney - Australian brokers said Thursday and Friday saw a significant turnaround in sentiment for the Australian market and they predicted further gains next week . 
however , brokers cautioned that a consolidation was overdue in the U.S. market and this would be reflected locally . 
&quot; The U.S. market is looking strong and I think our rise will continue so long as the U.S. does . 
but if the U.S. has a hiccup we will do exactly the same , &quot; said Peter Struk , a dealer at Sydney broker , Reynolds and Co . 
the benchmark All Ordinaries index ended at a record closing high of 2,387.3 on Friday , a gain of 25.2 points over the week . 
Taipei - brokers said Taiwan share prices were likely to slide in the coming week amid profit-taking pressue after the market failed to break resistance at 6,650 points , brokers said . 
&quot; The index is at a comparatively high level compared with the stagnant domestic economy , which so far has not shown any apparent recovery , &quot; said Allen Huang , an investment manager at National Securities . 
the index ended at 6,587.44 on Friday , just above its week-earlier 6,581.96 . 
Wellington - New Zealand shares closed firmer on Friday in a week dominated by market leader Telecom , which announced a record first half profit and a NZ $ 1 billion share repurchase plan on Thursday . 
brokers said strong volume , especially in brewer Lion Nathan , was an encouraging sign for the market , which is still awaiting the outcome of drawn-out coalition talks after an inconclusive general election on October 12 . 
the NZSE-40 capital index ended the week at 2,351.94 , up from 2,334.89 a week earlier .
