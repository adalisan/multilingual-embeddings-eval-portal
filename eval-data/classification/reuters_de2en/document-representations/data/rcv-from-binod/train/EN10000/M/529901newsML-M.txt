the property index hit a year &apos;s low of 1,324.94 , a drop of 4.36 percent . 
not since the main index of 30 blue chip companies took a 110.44-point dive on October 28 last year has the Philippine Stock Exchange seen a gloomier day , analysts said . 
&quot; The nasty rumours on Empire East exacerbated jitters the Philippines may be the next Thailand , &quot; said a foreign broker , referring to mass-housing builder Empire East Land Holdings . 
empire &apos;s shares plummetted almost 30 percent to 3.65 pesos despite a denial of what the company said were &quot; vicious &quot; rumours about its financial health . 
&quot; We categorically and vehemently deny the rumours circulated in the stock exchanges today alleging that Empire East has declared , or is about to declare , bankruptcy , &quot; corporate secretary Enrique Santos Sy said in a letter to the Exchange . 
&quot; The company is in fact in in a very sound financial condition , &quot; he added .

President Fidel Ramos at a news conference dismissed fears the country might be following the wake of Thailand where investors had lost confidence in financial institutions and banks with large exposures to an overheated property sector . 
&quot; The Philippines is different from Thailand . 
with due respect to them , we feel our macro-economic fundamentals that we have put in place are very , very sound , &quot; Ramos said . 
&quot; The property sector has been forewarned about not overdoing it . 
our banking community likewise has been warned about overheating by no less than the governor of the ( Central Bank ) , who is a very conservative monetary authority . 
but the sentiment-driven market ignored fundamentals with foreign houses joining a wave of selling . 
&quot; It has a snowball effect , &quot; said Erwin Tan , vice president for research of Abacus Securies Corp , referring to market anxieties about the property and banking sectors . 
&quot; It &apos;s for them to continue to deliver their projects ... 
I think that &apos;s the only thing that will put away all these rumours , &quot; Tan said , adding he believed the market &apos;s negative sentiment would persist for some time . 
&quot; It was just net selling . 
people want to get out of the market expecting it go a little more down , &quot; dealer Victor Cuna of DBS Securities Philippines Inc said .
