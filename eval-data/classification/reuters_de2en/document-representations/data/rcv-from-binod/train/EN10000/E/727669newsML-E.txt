Thailand has no plans to issue any new government baht bonds ( corrects to make clear that the finance ministry official was talking only about plans for new government bonds and did not mention state enterprise bonds ) in the domestic market anytime soon , a senior finance ministry official said on Monday . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see the likelihood of the government issuing ( baht ) bonds just yet . 
the government would rather choose not to shoulder heavy interest payments , &quot; the ministry &apos;s secretary general Chatumongkol Sonakul told reporters . 
the official made the comments in response to questions on whether the government planned to issue more domestic baht bonds to help develop a benchmark for yields and interest rates in the fledgling local debt market . 
Chatumongkol earlier spoke at an Asian bonds conference .
