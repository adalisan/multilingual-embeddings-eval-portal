Hong Kong stocks are set for a steep rise on Wednesday after the Dow industrials roared to an all-time high overnight following an upbeat report on the U.S. economy by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan . 
Greenspan said the Fed would raise interest rates if needed but suggested that might not happen anytime soon . 
the comments were perceived by Wall Street as suggesting that Fed policy was on hold . 
the Dow jumped 154.93 points to a record 8,061.65 . 
&quot; It was a significant jump and the reason behind it was interest rates and inflation , &quot; said Kent Rossiter , institutional sales manager at Nikko Securities . 
he said the Hang Seng Index could jump to around 15,600 points on Wednesday after the blue chip barometer fell 89.52 points on Tuesday to close at 15,446.78 . 
Ben Kwong , director of research at Dharmala Securities , expected a 100 to 200 point gain . 
&quot; But I think market sentiment remains quite cautious because the market has registered strong gains already in the recent rally and some of the blue chips have already lost momentum like HSBC , &quot; he said . 
utility stocks should remain a focus , while an encouraging response to Cheung Kong &apos;s property sale in the New Territories should help property counters , brokers said .
