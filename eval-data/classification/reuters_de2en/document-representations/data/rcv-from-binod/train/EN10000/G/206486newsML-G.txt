a high court rejected an appeal on Wednesday that might have led to the reopening of President Ernesto Samper &apos;s drug corruption trial in Congress on grounds that the original trial was flawed by a lack of due process . 
the appeal was filed by former Justice Minister Enrique Parejo , an outspoken Samper critic , who argued his constitutional rights were violated when Congress denied him the right to participate in Samper &apos;s trial as an ad hoc &quot; people &apos;s representative &quot; or ombudsman . 
but Colombia &apos;s nine-member Constitutional Court rejected the appeal by 7-2 after four hours of deliberations late on Wednesday , arguing the case against Samper was closed and no longer subject to appeal . 
the majority ruling also determined Parejo had no legitimate right to participate in the congressional trial in the first place . 
&quot; The basic argument is that there was no violation of due process , &quot; Carlos Gaviria , the high court &apos;s chief magistrate , told Reuters in a telephone interview . 
the House of Representatives voted 111-49 on June 14 to close the case that might have led to Samper &apos;s impeachment on charges he accepted millions of dollars in Cali cartel drug money to finance his 1994 election campaign . 
critics , including senior U.S. State Department officials , dimissed the decision as a whitewash when it was handed down in June and the United States expressed its disgust a month later by stripping Samper of his U.S. travel visa .
