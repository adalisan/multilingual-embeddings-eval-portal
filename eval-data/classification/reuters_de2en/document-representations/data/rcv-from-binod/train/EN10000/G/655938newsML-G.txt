disappointed Romania said on Thursday it would keep trying to persuade the United States to back its bid for quick admission to NATO . 
&quot; This decision does not protect sufficiently U.S. interests in this region , &quot; Foreign Minister Adrian Severin told a news conference after a U.S. announcement that it would back only Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic for the alliance &apos;s first wave of expansion . 
Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea , who leaves for Washington next week to lobby support in the U.S. Senate , said Romania had not given up hope of first-round admission at next month &apos;s NATO summit in Madrid . 
&quot; We believe the final decision will be taken by consensus in Madrid , &quot; he told reporters . 
&quot; We will continue to play our cards until the end and we won &apos;t stop until the summit . 
Severin suggested Washington could yet be swayed . 
&quot; The final formula of NATO &apos;s first-wave expansion will only be known at Madrid , &quot; he said . 
&quot; By then , we are sure that the U.S. administration will take into consideration all the pertinent arguments in our favour . 
a Foreign Ministry statement said that as far as Romania was concerned &quot; it is not the final decision of the United States , nor is it NATO &apos;s final decision &quot; . 
Polish Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati , in Bucharest to discuss three-way co-operation with Romania and Ukraine , offered no comment on the announcement except to say he favoured quick Romanian membership . 
the announcement by U.S. Defence Secretary William Cohen at a NATO meeting also left out Slovenia . 
both countries are considered longshot prospects for first-wave admission . 
Italy , a staunch supporter of both countries , also disagreed with the decision and Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta said he would try to persuade NATO members to broaden the invitation . 
France has also backed Romania . 
U.S. officials said Romania and Slovenia needed more time to qualify and made clear that there was little chance of a change in Washington &apos;s position . 
Romania &apos;s centrist leaders , who won power in last November &apos;s election after seven years of rule by ex-communists , have led a high-profile campaign to persuade the United States and Germany to end their reservations over Romania &apos;s bid . 
President Emil Constantinescu meets German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn on July 2 in a last-ditch attempt to rally German support . 
Western commentators say Romania has made progress in meeting membership criteria , including the conclusion of treaties with long-standing rival Hungary and with the former Soviet republic of Ukraine .
