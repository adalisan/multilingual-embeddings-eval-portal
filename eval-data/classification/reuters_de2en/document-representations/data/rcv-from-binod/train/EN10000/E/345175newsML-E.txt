the Inland Revenue Department has assessed $ 140 million in back taxes from deals involved in the so-called &quot; winebox &quot; of documents , according to briefing papers to the incoming government released on Thursday . 
it said all but $ 38,000 of that is being disputed by corporate taxpayers and the outcome of these objections would determine how much revenue the department collected . 
the 60 deals involved were brought to light by Treasurer Winston Peters when in opposition and led to the establishment of the Davison Commission of Inquiry into Cook Islands Tax Matters . 
the Commission is required to establish if Inland Revenue and the Serious Fraud Office acted lawfully and competently in handling the documents . 
&quot; The department is already considering the likely issues that may ensue from the Commission &apos;s report , &quot; the department said , adding there had been important changes to the law since the transactions in the 1980s . 
a new compliance and penalties regime had introduced penalties for adopting an abusive tax position . 
&quot; Other structural changes , initiated prior to and independent of the inquiry , have also been made that may address some of the issues raised in the report , &quot; the department said . 
the briefing to the incoming government was prepared before the October 12 , 1996 election which returned a centre-right coalition of the conservative National Party and Peters &apos; nationalist New Zealand First Party .
