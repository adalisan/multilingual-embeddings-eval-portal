financial markets rejoiced Tuesday over a sharp drop in March durable goods orders and good news on wages that should take some pressure off the Federal Reserve to raise rates in May , economists said . 
&quot; Both ( reports ) were very constructive . 
durable goods were weaker than anticipated ... it puts a question mark as to whether the Fed moves in May , &quot; said Marilyn Shaja , money market economist at Donaldson , Lufkin and Jenrette Securities . 
orders for big-ticket items fell 3.0 percent in March , the largest drop since August 1996 , according to the government . 
the decline came amid forecasts for a flat number , after a downwardly revised 0.8-percent gain in February . 
the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond leaped 1-1 / 4 points after the Commerce Department &apos;s durables data , which came out alongside the Labor Department &apos;s release of a lower-than-expected 0.6-percent rise in the first quarter Employment Cost Index ( ECI ) . 
&quot; It &apos;s good news for the market . 
obviously , the Employment Cost Index is a huge part of the story as well this morning , &quot; said Dana Johnson , managing director for research at First Chicago Capital Markets Inc . 
&quot; The combination of the two really will allow the Fed to go slowly , in terms of its tightening process , &quot; Johnson added . 
orders for durable goods are typically volatile on a month-to-month basis , economists said . 
still , the lower level of March orders shows broad softness and flattens the recent positive trend , they said . 
overall orders can be buffeted by large monthly swings in transportation equipment . 
but even subtracting the 4.3 percent retreat in March transport orders , durables were off a sharp 2.6 percent . 
durables were also off 2.6 percent without defense orders . 
economists said the data could be used to construct a case for a tapering off of economic growth in the second and third quarters , after the bubbly 3.8 percent pace in the final three months of 1996 . 
preliminary first-quarter gross domestic product growth is due Wednesday , with forecasters eyeing a robust 4.1 percent . 
the strong dollar in 1997 seems to be taking a toll on manufacturers of heavy goods , Johnson said . 
&quot; A large part of our manufacturing sector is involved in international trade , and the ( strong ) dollar made their prices go up , &quot; he said . 
the upbeat mood of the markets could be tempered by a slew of data in the coming days , most importantly April non-farm payrolls on Friday , economists said . 
&quot; The durable orders should be a demonstration that the economy does not move in a straight line ... obviously the economy is not roaring ahead and we &apos;re not seeing the rise in wage pressures that were very much a concern , &quot; said Lynn Reaser , chief economist at Barnett Banks Inc . 
Reaser expects a 180,000 rise in April payrolls , below the 211,000 expected on Wall Street .
