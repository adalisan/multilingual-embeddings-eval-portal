blue-chip stocks rallied for a third day in a row on Wednesday amid reports that tobacco companies are negotiating a settlement of massive lawsuits against the industry . 
bonds edged lower on renewed fears of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve in May , while the dollar fell against the Japanese yen after remarks by Japanese and U.S. officials raised fresh concern about central bank intervention . 
the Dow Jones industrial average ended up 92.71 points , or 1.41 percent , at 6,679.87 . 
the gain extended into a third session the blue chips &apos; bounce from last week &apos;s sell-off . 
with the gain , the Dow index has recovered 288 points , or more than 40 percent , of the nearly 700-point plunge between March 11 and April 11 . 
in the broader market , advancing issues led declines 1,401 to 1,038 on active volume of 499 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
the news that tobacco companies were negotiating with state attorneys general to settle the massive lawsuits sparked new life into tobacco shares and helped stocks advance despite a weak performance by bonds . 
&quot; We got off to a good start with the positive reaction to the potential tobacco settlement , &quot; said Charlie crane , chief market strategist at Key Asset Management . 
&quot; This was the first time in awhile that bonds were a touch soft and stocks were more than a touch strong , &quot; he said . 
but even as blue chips were roaring ahead , many analysts focused on the broad market , which was fairly mixed . 
once again , technology shares failed to take part in the rally , resulting in a second consecutive decline for the Nasdaq composite index , which ended 2.61 points lower at 1,210.27 . 
also weaker were interest-rate sensitive groups such as banks , which met with early selling pressure after new data showed economic activity continues at a bustling pace . 
the data included industrial output and manufacturing capacity utilization . 
&quot; This is not the kind of scenario from which bulls are born , &quot; said Dick Stein , vice president at U.S. Clearing Corp. 
the 30-year Treasury bond was off 2 / 32 , or 62.5 cents per $ 1,000 face value , sending its yield up to 7.10 percent from Tuesday &apos;s close of 7.09 percent . 
the price and yield move in opposite directions . 
in late New York trading , the dollar settled at 125.75 Japanese yen , down from 126.07 yen late Tuesday . 
the dollar rose to 1.7285 German marks from 1.7270 marks . 
coffee prices soared to a 2-1 / 2 year high on renewed worries about supplies for roasters this year . 
at the Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York , coffee for May delivery closed at 208.05 cents a pound , up 15.65 cents or 8 percent for the day and the highest price for coffee since September 1994 . 
at the New York Mercantile Exchange , oil prices fell sharply as a leading oil industry trade group said gasoline supplies were sufficient to meet even the most aggressive demand this spring and summer . 
gasoline for May delivery fell 1.52 cents to 60.38 cents , with May crude oil ending down 48 cents a barrel at $ 19.35 and May heating oil down 1.37 cents a gallon at 53.48 cents . 
at the Chicago Board of Trade , nervous selling tied to reports of the death of an Indiana man from &quot; mad cow disease &quot; helped pushed down the price of corn , the main ingredient in cattle feed , traders said . 
corn for May delivery closed down 5-1 / 2 cents a bushel at $ 2.97-1 / 4 . 
in Tokyo , the 225-share Nikkei average climbed 97.61 points to close at 18,031.20 .
