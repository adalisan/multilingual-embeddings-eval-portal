the Thai government on Thursday bought 14,800 tonnes of RSS3 rubber through the southern hat Yai-based auction market at 109.00 US cents per kg , an official at the market said . 
the purchase was for July shipment and not for May as earlier believed to be , the official said . 
the government originally sought only 10,000 tonnes but later increased the amount as most sellers agreed to sell at that level sought , he said . 
the government has so far bought more than 40,000 tonnes of local rubber to prop up prices since March 5 .
