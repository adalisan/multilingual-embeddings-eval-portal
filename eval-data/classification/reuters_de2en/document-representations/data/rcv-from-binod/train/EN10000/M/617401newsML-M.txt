world oil prices tumbled on Tuesday , virtually wiping out two weeks of gains as U.S. gasoline markets slipped into reverse . 
world benchmark Brent crude oil futures for July delivery ended 78 cents to trade at $ 19.22 a barrel on London &apos;s International Petroleum Exchange ( IPE ) , led by a slide of over three percent in U.S. gasoline prices . 
&quot; ( U.S. ) unleaded gasoline was supporting the market last week , &quot; said a broker . 
&quot; Now that &apos;s gone , everybody has an excuse to sell . 
Brent crude rallied $ 1 a barrel during the past two weeks as U.S. refineries ratcheted up gasoline production in preparation for the unofficial start of the peak summer driving season , traditionally marked by Monday &apos;s Memorial Day holiday . 
investment funds also took advantage of bullish signals on price charts to build up substantial long positions in crude and product futures . 
but with industry data suggesting flat demand and strong refinery production , the institutional investors were becoming increasingly isolated on the long side of the market , dealers said . 
&quot; There &apos;s a growing feeling that they may be long and wrong , &quot; said a broker in London . 
while U.S. gasoline stocks remain nearly seven million barrels below levels seen this time last year , demand in 1997 is expected to rise a mere 0.3 percent promising a surprise windfall for the 82 percent of Americans who vacation by car . 
&quot; This year we don &apos;t get the call from members . 
they &apos;re not as worried about prices , &quot; said the American Automobile Association ( AAA ) spokesman Mike Morrisey last week . 
subdued demand growth in the U.S. , by far the world &apos;s biggest importer of gasoline , has depressed oil refinery profits worldwide as product prices failed to maintain their premium to crude values . 
Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell on Monday became the latest refiner to feel the pinch , trimming by about 15 percent crude throughput at its massive 350,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) Rotterdam plant . 
shell &apos;s move was in line with similar cutbacks recently at Esso Singapore &apos;s 230,000 bpd plant and at the huge 400,000 bpd British Petroleum / Texaco Nerefco complex , also in Rotterdam . 
refining margins in Asia shed some 65 cents a barrel last week , turning narrow profits at less simple plants into losses of about 37 cents a barrel .
