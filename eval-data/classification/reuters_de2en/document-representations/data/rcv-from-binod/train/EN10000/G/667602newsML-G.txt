the Danish High Court on Tuesday completed hearing a challenge to the legality of Denmark &apos;s European Union treaties which legal experts say could end the country &apos;s EU membership under the present terms . 
judgment is to be delivered at 1100 GMT on June 27 , but legal experts say that an eventual Supreme Court appeal could delay a definitive verdict until the end of the year or beyond . 
the plaintiffs , a non-partisan group of 10 Danes , see little chance of the High Court ruling for their argument that since joining the EU in 1973 Denmark has ceded national authority to European Union institutions in breach of its own constitution . 
they have complained that the lower court is too conservative and does not take its case seriously , but in Tuesday &apos;s summing-up government counsel Gregers Larsen said it was the plaintiffs who were flippant . 
the plaintiffs &apos; arguments , on the other hand , are not . 
they have used their summing-up for political dispute rather than legal argument . 
what the plaintiffs seek is a political review of Denmark &apos;s EU memnbership , &quot; he told the court . 
regardless of its eventual outcome , the case is already having a direct political effect . 
Danish leaders say that a referendum on the revised EU treaty now being drafted at the Amsterdam summit should wait until the final Supreme Court ruling on the court case . 
the group of 10 plaintiffs , calling themselves The Constitution Committee have sought to have confidential government papers , dating back to Denmark &apos;s EU accession and beyond , introduced as evidence but have been repeatedly refused . 
the committee &apos;s lawyers will argue that the treaties do not sufficiently define the extent to which the European Court and other EU institutions may overide national bodies . 
the Danish constitution &apos;s article 20 states that national powers may only be delegated to international organisations &quot; within a specified limit &quot; . 
the centre-left coalition government believes its case is watertight and lawyers from both sides say that state attorneys &apos; task has been eased by rulings that the case should be limited to events since the 1992 Maastricht treaty . 
independent legal experts generally see a government win as the most likely outcome , but by no means certain . 
a defeat would force Denmark into the unwieldy and potentially destabilising process of renegotiating its EU treaties or force upon it the complex and difficult task of rewriting the national constitution . 
the government wants a quick decision , as the case casts a shadow over Danish ratification of a revised European Union treaty to be signed at the next summit , in Amsterdam next month . 
Danes , traditionally cool toward European integration , rejected the Maastricht Treaty outright in a 1992 referendum . 
voters grudgingly approved the treaty the following year on condition that Denmark opt out of economic and monetary union and joint defence , policing and asylum policies .
