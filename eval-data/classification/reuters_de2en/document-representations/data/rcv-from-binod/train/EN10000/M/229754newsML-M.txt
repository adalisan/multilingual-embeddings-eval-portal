the New Zealand dollar shrugged off political uncertainty to close sharply higher on Monday , due largely to a resurgent Australian currency , dealers said . 
&quot; The Aussie is just about to breach 82 ( US ) cents and the kiwi &apos;s being dragged up on the back of it , &quot; a chief dealer said . 
the kiwi closed at US $ 0.7135 / 42 , up from 0.7118 / 25 at the open , but was unchanged on its Trade-Weighted Index at 67.10 . 
&quot; It &apos;s closing fairly bid . 
it &apos;s broken the 0.7130 level , where we thought sellers were all afternoon , &quot; said another dealer . 
he said the dollar had dipped slightly on comments by Labour Party finance spokesman Michael Cullen that the high exchange rate would be the first priority of a Labour-led government . 
but there had been good buying out of Asia since mid-afternoon which , coupled with stop-loss buying , had seen the kiwi spike higher . 
&quot; We &apos;re trading up through quite key levels really , &quot; the dealer said . 
nationalist New Zealand First continues to negotiate separately with the conservative caretaker National government and centre-left Labour to form a coalition after the October 12 election . 
an indication of which way NZ First will go is widely expected this week . 
the dealer said he expected the kiwi to be sold on either outcome . 
the shape of the new government and future fiscal policy overshadowed Treasury &apos;s December Economic and Fiscal Update , in which it forecast slightly lower government surpluses than previously . 
dealers said the DEFU held no surprises and had little if any impact on the currency . 
the kiwi was seen testing higher overnight in a 0.7120-45 range .
