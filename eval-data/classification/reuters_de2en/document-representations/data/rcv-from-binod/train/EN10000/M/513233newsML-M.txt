the Tokyo stock market &apos;s benchmark Nikkei 225 index is expected to hover narrowly around 18,000 in Thursday &apos;s session , brokers said , with the downside supported by another leap on Wall Street overnight . 
on Wednesday , the 225-share Nikkei average climbed 97.61 points or 0.54 percent to close above the psychologically important 18,000 barrier for the first time in six sessions at 18,031.20 . 
Nikkei June futures rose 80 points to 18,040 . 
&quot; buying of battle-scarred financial sector issues is continuing and turnover is rising -- both are good signs , &quot; said Ken Ishikida , Sanyo Securities general manager .
