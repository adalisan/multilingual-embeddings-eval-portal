Dutch bonds partly recovered morning losses at Monday &apos;s close and the spread against bonds , which widened at the open , narrowed on later profit-taking . 
&quot; We &apos;re pretty much back to where we started , &quot; one trader said . 
traders said Dutch bonds looked well-supported , especially in the short and mid-parts of the curve , which led to slight curve steepening , particularly at the long end . 
Jan 2006s were up about 0.05 from Friday , whereas Jan 2023s were down 0.08 . 
Dutch bonds outperformed German bunds in the morning , the 10-year spread trading two basis points wider at -10 BP . 
however , a feeling that the Dutch market appeared expensive relative to bunds led to profit-taking in the afternoon and a return of spreads to those at Friday &apos;s close . 
the 10-year spread was back at -8 BP . 
the closure of the United States due to Labour Day led to thin trading and a lack of economic indicators . 
traders said Thursday &apos;s German second quarter GDP figures and Friday &apos;s U.S. jobless claims figures would be signicant .
