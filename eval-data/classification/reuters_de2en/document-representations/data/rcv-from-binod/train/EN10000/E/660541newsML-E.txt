after two days of nearly continuous debate , the House Ways and Means Committee early Friday approved a tax plan that closes some corporate tax loopholes while granting tax relief for companies . 
the sweeping reform , which aims to cut taxes by $ 85 billion over the next five years , would reduce the corporate capital gains tax rate gradually over two years to 30 percent from 35 percent . 
but the final measure , approved by the Committee on a vote of 22 to 16 , would eliminate a popular technique used in mergers and acquisitions to escape taxes known as a &quot; Morris Trust . 
&quot; One thing is we must be sure that abuses that have occured in that category will no longer be able to occur and that is what I am determined to do , &quot; Committee Chairman Bill Archer , a Texas Republican , told reporters . 
using a trust , corporations have been allowed to spin-off tax-free to their shareholders units of companies they acquire . 
ending that practice will put more than $ 1.6 billion over five years in the government &apos;s hands , Archer maintains . 
however , some members of the panel said the revenue-raising measure may reach too far and had planned to offer an amendment to narrow the scope of that provision to exclude internal corporate transactions . 
instead , after debating some 60 amendments in the tax bill , the lawmakers left the matter to be worked out between House and Senate lawmakers when they reconcile the differences in their tax bills . 
&quot; I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen on that , &quot; Archer said of the Morris Trust provision . 
&quot; I &apos;m sure this matter will be addressed in the conference committee . 
closing another tax loophole , the Committee approved a provision to impose a tax in many cases on investors who sell short stock that they own , a provision expected to raise $ 708 million over the next five years . 
this technique known as &quot; shorting against the box &quot; allows an investor to effectively sell a stock holding without triggering capital gains taxes . 
the panel did not adopt a measure to phase out the corporate alternative minimum tax , a provision that was proposed by Archer on Monday and would have been a boon for the corporate community . 
only small U.S. companies would be exempt of the alternative minimum tax , under the approved tax measure . 
the committee also adopted a plan allowing companies to offset ordinary losses against capital gains , thereby reducing the amount of gains subject to the capital gains tax .
