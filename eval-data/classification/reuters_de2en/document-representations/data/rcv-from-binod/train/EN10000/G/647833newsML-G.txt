a top Israeli defence official warned on Monday that Syrian President Hafez al-Assad would suffer quick defeat if he launched an attack against Israel . 
&quot; It must be made clear to Assad that there is only one place ( to solve disputes ) -- that is at the negotiating table . 
if he should make a mistake , he will be overcome very quickly , &quot; Defence Ministry director-general Ilan Biran told Israel Radio . 
Israel &apos;s Channel Two news said last week the Syrian army had completed a series of exercises aimed at increasing its readiness for war . 
Israel and Syria have fought several wars and conducted five years of intermittent peace talks without solving their dispute over the fate of the Golan Heights . 
Syria wants back the strategic plateau Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war in exchange for peace . 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes withdrawal from the area . 
the arch-rivals have not held talks in over a year . 
tension between the two countries soared last September when Syria moved thousands of its troops in Lebanon to within striking range of the Golan . 
Damascus said then the realignment was defensive . 
Biran also called on the international community to prevent Iran from obtaining long-range missiles which could reach Israel . 
&quot; This must be prevented and I think the nations of the world that desire a proper path , should also pledge themselves to preventing this , &quot; he told the radio .
