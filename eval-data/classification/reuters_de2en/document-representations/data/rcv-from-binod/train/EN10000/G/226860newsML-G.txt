Germany &apos;s opposition Greens , already the third largest group in parliament , on Saturday devoted the second day of a party conference to broadening their appeal beyond their environmentalist origins . 
delegates at the congress in the eastern town of Suhl passed resolutions on tax reform and other economic policies in a bid to portray themselves as a mature party capable of helping to topple Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the next elections . 
the Greens , who grew out of the peace movement and radical student demonstrations of the 1960s and 1970s and formally became a party only 16 years ago , hope to form a coalition with the main opposition Social Democrats ( SPD ) after the 1998 poll . 
&quot; We Greens no longer need to fight for the role of the third party , &quot; said Rezzo Schlauch , who won almost 40 percent of the vote last month in the election for a new mayor of Stuttgart . 
&quot; We must open ourselves to new goals . 
Schlauch said his performance in Stuttgart , where he narrowly failed to defeat a candidate from Kohl &apos;s conservatives , showed the Greens could compete in industrial cities as well as areas with a high ecological awareness . 
&quot; The lesson of Stuttgart is that , with credible personalities , Green policies and professional and creative campaigning , we can win our own majorities , &quot; he said . 
keen to prove they can act as more than just the nation &apos;s environmental conscience , the delegates approved a plan for a radical reform of the tax system . 
the basic rate of income tax would fall by almost six points to 20 percent under the plan , designed to reduce taxes for low earners , hit the rich harder and curtail tax evasion . 
opinion polls show the Greens attracting around 12 percent support nationally -- more than double the rating for the traditional third party , the liberal Free Democrats ( FDP ) . 
polls also show if the SPD and Greens maintained current levels of support they would be able to oust the centre-right coalition of Kohl &apos;s Christian Democrats and the FDP in 1998 . 
leading Greens want to make inroads not just into policy fields where they have previously not been taken seriously but also in geographical areas where they are currently weak . 
that means above all eastern Germany , which accounts for a fifth of the German population but only seven percent of Greens party membership . 
analysts say the Greens are weak in the east because they are seen as having no real answers to the region &apos;s higher unemployment and industrial decline . 
the party was expected to take one step towards addressing the problem by electing an east German schoolteacher , Gunda Roestel , as its co-leader later in the day . 
the fiercely egalitarian party has one female and one male co-leader , currently Krista Sager and Juergen Trittin . 
only Trittin is standing for re-election and Roestel was expected to replace Sager unopposed .
