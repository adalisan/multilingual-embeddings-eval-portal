June Bund futures traded on LIFFE will remain on Friday within the upward channel that has held the contract since early April , and look towards trendline resistance up to 102.75 / 76 , analysts said . 
&quot; There are two trendlines to the upside , the first coming in 102.67 and the second at 102.75 , &quot; said a futures broker at a German bank in Frankfurt . 
&quot; The key one is 102.75 . 
a daily high from February 17 also comes in around this level at 102.76 . 
at 0659 GMT , June Bund futures were at 102.45 , up eight basis points from Thursday &apos;s close . 
to the downside , the broker said an initial prop for the market came from intra-day suppport around 102.34 / 35 , which coincides with the five-day moving average . 
&quot; It looks like the range between 102.34 on the downside and 102.67 to 76 on the upside , &quot; he said . 
below 102.34 , trendline support comes in at 102.17 . 
&quot; The long-term trend which started with the lows made on April 4 is a bit far away right now at 101.35 , &quot; the broker said . 
he said the 20-day moving average was also quite far off . 
that currently comes in at 101.42 . 
Anil Patel , technical analyst at Nomura International in London , said Bunds were trying to create a higher base and momentum was building up for a move to target 102.79 , the high on March 4 . 
&quot; Daily short-term momentum is overbought so we have to correct that , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We can probably press forward to 103.00 , but it all depends on treasuries , because they backed off ( on Thursday ) and Bunds are following treasuries . 
he said Bunds had largely ignored estimates that the German tax estimate for 1997 is likely to have a shortfall of 18 billion marks . 
at the short end , September Euromark futures were at 96.76 , unchanged on the day . 
technical analysts at a European bank in London said there was scope for a push to the low 96.80s. 
&quot; Euromarks continue to firm , slowly but surely , &quot; they said in a note to clients .
