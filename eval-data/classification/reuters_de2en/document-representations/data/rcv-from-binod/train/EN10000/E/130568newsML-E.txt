Thai liquidity in the fourth quarter is not likely to be as tight as it was the same period last year due partly to an expected rise in money supply during the upcoming election , a central bank official said on Monday . 
Thailand &apos;s general election is to be held on November 17 . 
&quot; The central bank expects liquidity in the fourth quarter will not be as tight as last year . 
the disbursement of government budget and high circulation of cash during the election would increase money supply in the system , &quot; Bank of Thailand governor Rerngchai Marakanond told reporters . 
Thailand &apos;s new budget year began on October 1 . 
traditionally , millions of dollars are spent on Thai election campaigns , including money paid to lure political defections . 
Rerngchai said the inflow of foreign funds has slowed since August as a result of the Bot &apos;s measures of curbing short-term foreign inflows which took effect in July . 
in August and September , monthly foreign inflows averaged 10 to 25 billion baht , compared with 40 to 50 billion baht each month in the first six months of the year , he said .
