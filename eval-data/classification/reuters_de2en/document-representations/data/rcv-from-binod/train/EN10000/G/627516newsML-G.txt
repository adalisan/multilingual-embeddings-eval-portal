French Socialist leader Lionel Jospin has deftly tapped voter exasperation at government high-handedness and record unemployment to make himself an upset favourite to be prime minister after Sunday &apos;s parliamentary election runoff . 
Jospin &apos;s speeches fail to inflame even his most devout followers , but the ex-education minister has come from behind , hammering away at a theme that French voters deserve more respect from arrogant rulers . 
&quot; To change , France must find confidence in itself , &quot; he wrote in one article during the month-long campaign for the National Assembly . 
&quot; It will only do so by finding confidence in its rulers . 
it &apos;s a question of respect . 
the silver-haired son of a schoolteacher , with a strong reputation for honesty , has sought to distance himself from the Socialists &apos; legacy by admitting that politicians on both left and right have failed to keep promises . 
Jospin , 59 , has suggested the snap election masks a secret agenda by the ruling centre-right -- a swing to &quot; hardline capitalism &quot; , more austerity to qualify for a single currency and an amnesty to pardon political sleaze . 
the ruling coalition has spluttered denials but failed to produce convincing reasons for the election . 
Conservative President Jacques Chirac called the vote saying France needs a &quot; new Elan &quot; to help join a single European currency . 
Jospin set the tone for his campaign when , a day before Chirac announced the dissolution , he called it &quot; an admission of failure &quot; when an election was not due until next year . 
in a prime-time television interview , he also made a key promise -- if he won , he would not impose further austerity to qualify France for a single European currency , a vote-winner in a country that only narrowly approved the Maastricht Treaty in a cliffhanger 1992 referendum . 
analysts say his commitment to the euro currency is probably no weaker than Chirac &apos;s but that , out of power , he can play to the gallery rather than to financial markets . 
the left scored a stunning upset by winning most votes on the May 25 first round , and the electorate looks tempted to force Chirac to share power with Jospin . 
&quot; cohabitation &quot; could tie France &apos;s main political forces into a straitjacket for the next five years . 
narrowly beaten by Chirac in the 1995 presidential runoff , Jospin also managed to make the election a presidential-style contest between himself and unpopular Prime Minister Alain Juppe . 
Juppe stood down on Monday after the government &apos;s first-round debacle , leaving Jospin shadow-boxing against Juppe &apos;s potential successors led by socially-minded outgoing National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin . 
&quot; The rulers are again underestimating the collective intelligence and lucidity of the French people , &quot; Jospin said after the centre-right floated Seguin in an odd partnership with free-marketeer Alain Madelin as last-ditch saviours . 
the right accuses Jospin of misleading voters by saying he would not raise taxes to fund his campaign promises of creating 700,000 jobs and cutting the working week from 39 hours to 35 without lowering salaries . 
opinion polls show voters are sceptical about Socialist plans to combat joblessness of 12.8 percent , but many seem more upset by the right &apos;s failings -- Juppe himself came to power in 1995 promising to create 700,000 jobs by the end of 1996 .
