the FTSE 100 traded in a modestly higher range on Friday having earlier powered to a new record high for the second day in a row as a technical squeeze drove prices higher . 
the blue-chip index was 6.3 points up at 4,838 by 1050 GMT having notched up another all-time high of 4,879 earlier . 
two days after the new Labour government &apos;s first budget since 1978 , the market repeated Thursday &apos;s pattern with gains for domestic issues , especially banks , and big losses for exporters on worries over sterling strength . 
&quot; It &apos;s a bit quieter today . 
the reaction to the budget is certainly cooler and people are looking ahead to the weekend for a quieter look at what it all means , &quot; said NatWest strategist , David McBain . 
the broader FTSE index , the mid Cap 250 , was 15.4 points weaker at 4,459.8 . 
it ended on Thursday 3.9 points up at 4,475.2 , illustrating the strong hold of index derivatives on the main 100 index which soared to a record close . 
&quot; It is a very , very confused marketplace . 
there are huge two way pulls . 
it is very difficult to read it , &quot; said Charterhouse chief economist , Richard Jeffrey . 
&quot; There &apos;s uncertainty over what the eventual technical impact of the budget will be on the market , whether there will be a move away from equities ( due to the abolition of dividend tax relief ) although it was helpful on the economic front , &quot; he said . 
the market interpreted Wednesday &apos;s maiden budget from new Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown to mean an imminent sharp hike in interest rates , but it bounced on hopes that any dampening of inflationary pressures would ultimately be good news and it took the abolition of tax relief on dividends in its stride . 
with Wall Street closed for the U.S. 
independence Day holiday and no major corporate or economic news scheduled , shares are seen tracking futures closely through the session . 
domestic issues , financials in particular , gained for a second day on the view they are relatively insulated from the effects of sterling &apos;s strength , for their strong financial position and for the prospects of further bids and mergers in the industry . 
Lloyds put on 12-1 / 2p to 688p , Alliance &amp; Leicester 19p to 618-1 / 2p , Abbey National 14p to 911-1 / 2p and Standard Chartered 19p to 1,004-1 / 2p . 
big exporters suffered for a second day as worries intensified over dented profits with sterling &apos;s continuing strength .
