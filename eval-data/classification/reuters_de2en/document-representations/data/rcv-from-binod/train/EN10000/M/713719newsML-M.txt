India &apos;s soymeal exports are unlikely to be affected by an anticipated bumper U.S. soybean harvest as the two countries target different markets , trade officials said on Tuesday . 
&quot; Our main export markets are the Far East , the Middle East and the South East Asian countries , &quot; Davish Jain , chairman of the soybean Processors Association of India ( SOPA ) , told Reuters by telephone from the central city of Indore . 
&quot; Their ( U.S. ) main markets are the European countries . 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture last month projected a record soybean crop of 70.8 million tonnes in 1997 / 98 , up from 64.9 million in 1996 / 97 . 
&quot; In some circles , the talk is about 77 million tonnes , &quot; Jain said . 
for India to sustain its traditional markets it would need to export about 2.5 million tonnes of soymeal . 
&quot; If we have 2.5 million tonnes of soymeal to offer for exports in the coming year , we should find ourselves in a comfortable position , &quot; Jain said . 
India produced about four million tonnes of soybean in 1996 / 97 . 
its soymeal exports in 1996 / 97 are expected to be about 2.6 million tonnes , the same as last year . 
industry officials said the U.S. was trying to increase its exports to Asian countries . 
&quot; But even then , the market is quite big for both India and the U.S. as the demand is constantly increasing , &quot; Jain said . 
Virgil Miedema , regional director of the American soybean Association , told Reuters the U.S. was looking towards exploring South Asian markets for its exports . 
&quot; We would be looking into South Asian markets for our sales but they are long-term prospects , &quot; Miedema said . 
industry officials said India had an advantage over the United States in its exports to Asian countries due to geographical proximity , better quality and the ability to provide small shipments . 
&quot; India has the capability to supply small shipments which is not economically viable for the United States and the Indian quality is also good , &quot; Miedema said . 
&quot; Therefore , India has a market of its own . 
industry officials said soybean sowing in the central state of Madhya Pradesh had picked up after good rains in the past week . 
&quot; Last week there was a dry patch which was causing concern but now we have reports of widespread sowing operations after the needed rains , &quot; Jain said . 
Madhya Pradesh contributes about 80 percent of the country &apos;s soybean output . 
he said although sowing had been delayed by two weeks , the crop would not be delayed if rains continued to be favourable over the next two months . 
&quot; The progress of the crop depends on an ideal mixture of sun and rains , &quot; Jain said . 
the harvest was expected to start in mid-October . 
Jain said the soybean output target in 1997 / 98 had been set at five million tonnes . 
the area under soybeans was expected to increase by about 10 percent in 1997 / 98 from five million hectares in 1996 / 97 . 
&quot; Although productivity this year was not satisfactory , the per tonne realisation was higher than last year , &quot; Jain said . 
&quot; This should tempt the farmers to increase the crop area .
