the U.S. special envoy to the Great Lakes region Richard Bogosian said on Thursday Burundi &apos;s mainstream politicians favoured a fledgling peace process despite continued violence . 
&quot; All the players that I have met said that there was no way to win this war militarily . 
they all supported the idea of a national reconcilliation process , &quot; Bogosian told reporters after talks with military leader Pierre Buyoya and other politicians . 
at least 17 people including three soldiers were killed in two rebel attacks in Bubanza province in north Burundi , the local governor said on state radio on Thursday . 
Colonel Gerard Kayizo said 11 civilians and the three soldiers were killed at Ngara camp for displaced people . 
he said three civilians died in another attack , also on Wednesday , at nearby Gihanga village . 
Bubanza province is north of the capital Bujumbura . 
Bogosian &apos;s talks in Bujumbura did not include Leanord Nyangoma , leader of the main pro-Hutu rebel group the National Council for the Defence of Democracy . 
diplomats say Nyangoma , in exile since 1994 , refuses to talk to other political parties . 
Buyoya announced last month a pre-ceasefire agreement with CNDD aimed at ending more than three years of bitter ethnic civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 150,000 people . 
&quot; We are open to all the actors who support the peace process . 
I will also try to speak with the rebels to get the war stopped , &quot; Bogosian said . 
former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere , last year designated chief negotiator on Burundi by the U.N. and Organisation of African Unity , would arrive for talks in Burundi next week , Bogosian said . 
&quot; Some politicians are saying we must now start a national debate , while others think we must go directly to Arusha ( in Tanzania ) to negotiate , &quot; he said . 
ousted president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya who left the U.S. embassy in the capital on June 7 after nearly a year in hiding said he favoured all-party talks . 
information Minister Pierre-Claver Ndayicariye has called for political dialogue ahead of Burundi &apos;s 35th independence anniversary on July 1 . 
CNDD lost its rear bases in eastern Zaire last October at the start of the victorious rebellion against former president Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire . 
but the Hutu rebels are still able to move in most parts of tiny Burundi , staging hit-and-run attacks on Tutsi soldiers and civilians which are often followed by heavy reprisals against Hutu villagers .
