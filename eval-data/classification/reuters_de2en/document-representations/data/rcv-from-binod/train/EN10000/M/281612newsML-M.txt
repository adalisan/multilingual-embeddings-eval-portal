U.S. stock index futures ended lower , falling sharply in thin late dealings after other markets closed early ahead of the New Year &apos;s Day holiday . 
&quot; The market is all over the place but there &apos;s no volume , &quot; said one S &amp; P 500 futures trader on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange of the late , volatile dealings , in which March S &amp; Ps fell more than 14 full points . 
premiums had narrowed during the afternoon fall , sinking to levels where arbitrage sell programs would normally be triggered , but &quot; dealers aren &apos;t doing anything , &quot; the trader said . 
end of the year profit-taking and position squaring contributed to pressure during the day , right up to the closing bell in futures . 
contracts hit new lows after the close of cash stocks . 
but the decline most likely did not mean much for the longer-term outlook as it occurred ahead of the holiday in thin trading conditions , some analysts said . 
&quot; I look at this as an aberrational day , &quot; said Jay Hohmann , head futures trader at Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette Securities . 
&quot; I don &apos;t put any credence in the decline &quot; because of the upcoming holiday and its impact on dealings . 
futures had dropped in early dealings after U.S. Treasury bond futures dipped sharply following the release of stronger than expected U.S. economic data . 
November U.S. new single-family home sales rose 14.2 percent , the steepest rise since April 1993 . 
the Conference Board also said consumer confidence in December rose to 113.8 from November &apos;s revised 109.5 . 
and although the Chicago Purchasing Managers index for December slipped slightly , the decline was smaller than expected . 
Treasury bond prices fell more than a point , falling to new daily lows just before the early 1210 CST / 1810 GMT close of the bond futures market . 
the late drop in bonds set a negative tone for the rest of the afternoon in index futures . 
late pressure drove March S &amp; P 500s below chart support near 754.20 and 752.55 , which prompted some followthrough technical pressure that added to losses . 
all U.S. markets are closed Wednesday for the New Year &apos;s holiday , and trading resumes at normal times on Thursday . 
at settlement , March S &amp; P 500s were off 14.60 points at 744.50 , Russell 2000s eased 2.85 points to 362.75 , Value Line futures were off 6.10 points to 683.00 , Nikkei 225 index futures eased 15.0 to 19,380.0 and Midcap 400s eased 1.35 point to 256.60 .
