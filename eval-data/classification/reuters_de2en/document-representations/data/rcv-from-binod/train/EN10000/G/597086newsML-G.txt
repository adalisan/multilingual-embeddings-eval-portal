Cincinnati reds manager Ray Knight was suspended for three games by the National League on Tuesday for his tirade against an umpire during a loss to the San Diego Padres last Saturday . 
League president Leonard S. Coleman , who also fined Knight an undislosed amount , said the penalties were for &quot; inappropriate behaviour . 
Knight , who was also serving as third-base coach during last Saturday &apos;s game , was ejected by umpire Jerry Layne after Deion Sanders was thrown out in a close play at third . 
Knight got his money &apos;s worth for the ejection , uprooting the base from its moorings and slamming it down before leaving the field . 
it was the second ejection in 17 days for the frustrated Knight , who was also tossed from a May 1 game against Atlanta . 
the reds have the worst record in baseball at 13-29 . 
Knight will miss games in Houston on Tuesday and Wednesday and a home game against the Chicago Cubs on Friday before returning Saturday for another home game against the Cubs . 
hitting coach Dennis Menke will serve as acting manager in Knight &apos;s absence .
