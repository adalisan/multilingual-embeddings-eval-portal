the Polish budget draft for 1997 , which the government began debating this week , assumes the share of banks in deficit financing will nearly double , the Rzeczpospolita newspaper said on Wednesday . 
the paper said that according to a finance ministry draft it had obtained between 52 and 64 percent of the 1997 budget deficit , set at 11.3 billion zlotys , would be financed in the Polish banking system . 
it said banks would finance between 6.67 billion and 8.18 billion zlotys of the deficit , up from this year &apos;s expected 3.68 billion or 33 percent of the planned 9.5 billion zloty shortfall . 
the government , due to submit its final budget proposal to parliament by the end of this month , so far refused to officially release the details of the draft . 
the original 1996 budget plan assumed banks would finance almost eight billion zlotys out of the 9.5 billion zloty deficit but sales of government securities to non-banking investors proved much better than planned . 
Arkadiusz Kaminski , deputy head of the finance ministry &apos;s public debt department said exceptionally high demand for government paper this year was largely a result of a buying spree ahead of the planned abolition of tax deductions for purchases of government securities . 
he also said that the introduction of new instruments , such as a 10-year variable interest bond aimed at insurers and other long-term investors , helped boost sales . 
he said a lack of the tax deduction next year resulted in a more conservative estimate of demand for government securities outside of the banking system . 
&quot; We will strive to finance as much of the deficit as possible outside the banking system but the outcome depends on market conditions and that is why we have the more conservative plan , &quot; Kaminski said .
