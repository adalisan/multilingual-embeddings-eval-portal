London robusta coffee futures were called to open $ 30- $ 40 higher on Tuesday after steep New York gains on Monday , traders said . 
Chartwise , coffee remained neutral with benchmark May staying in an immediate range , confined by resistance at just below $ 1,600 and support at $ 1,535 . 
Elli Gifford , an independent technical analyst , said on balance , the immediate support was seen intact . 
further support is seen at $ 1,520 and $ 1,510 . 
&quot; But the potential on the upside is not that great , &quot; she added . 
the next resistance after the immediate level at just below $ 1,600 lies at $ 1,610 . 
the 14-day relative strength indicator is neutral at 41 percent , well above the 30-percent value oversold zone . 
the short 10-day moving average stood at $ 1,586 but medium-term averages were still above $ 1,610 mark . 
new York &apos;s arabica futures were sharply higher on Monday , stirred by news Colombia had closed coffee registrations for May and June shipments . 
&quot; This is highlighting the general fear that after the recent heavy shipments from Central America these countries may have little left to sell , &quot; broker GNI said . 
private Colombian exporters said the country &apos;s National Coffee Growers Federation notified them in a statement it was closing registration for May / June coffee exports , effective immediately . 
the federation chief Jorge Cardenas made no mention of the move at an impromptu press conference late on Monday . 
but he disclosed that Colombia &apos;s coffee production totalled just 10 million 60-kg bags in 1996 / 97 ( April / March ) , down from about 14 million in 1995 / 96 . 
in other news , workers at Brazil &apos;s key port of Santos will go on strike on Tuesday for an indefinite period . 
Union leaders said the stoppage could spread to the national level by Wednesday . 
traders are awaiting U.S. March green coffee stock data due after the close of the New York market on Tuesday to provide further direction .
