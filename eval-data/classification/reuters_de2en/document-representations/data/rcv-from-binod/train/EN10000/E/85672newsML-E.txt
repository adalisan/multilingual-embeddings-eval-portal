the IMF plans to reach a multi-million dollar loan pact with Bosnia by the end of the year as part of an international effort to show the war-ravaged nation that peace pays , an IMF official said on Monday . 
&quot; We &apos;ll be dashing as fast as possible , &quot; said Scott Brown , International Monetary Fund mission chief for Bosnia . 
&quot; We would like to do it before the end of the year . 
he spoke to reporters following release of a report by the World Bank and the European Commission showing that the pace of reconstruction in Bosnia has accelerated markedly , albeit unevenly , in the last few months . 
the IMF &apos;s Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility loan could be on the order of about $ 90 Millon over three years and would carry only a minimal interest charge of a half percent . 
by giving Bosnia its seal of approval with a loan , the IMF would pave the way for stepped-up assistance from donor nations and a massive debt relief programme . 
Bosnia &apos;s debts to the Paris Club of creditor countries and the London Club of commercial banks are estimated to be about $ 2 billion . 
&quot; We &apos;d like to have that ( debt-reduction ) operation in the early part of next year , &quot; Brown said . 
according to the World Bank / EC report , about $ 880 million of the $ 1.89 billion in financial assistance pledged to Bosnia has been , or is in the process of being , put to work , with contracts tendered , signed or underway . 
a further $ 500 million or so could be tendered or contracted by year-end , the report said . 
&quot; We have had great support from the world , but it is really not enough , &quot; Bosnian Prime Minister Hasan Muratovic said . 
&quot; Donors did not keep to their promises . 
the United States has tendered or contracted for $ 166.5 million of the $ 293.8 million it has pledged and the European Commission , $ 141.7 million , out of $ 353.5 million . 
some European nations have done better than others . 
Germany has handed out almost all the $ 50.8 million it pledged , but Italy has only done $ 7.2 million out of $ 67.7 million . 
the World Bank and the EC are hoping to host another donors &apos; pledging conference before the end of the year . 
Christine Wallich , Acting Director for Bosnia at the World Bank , said her organisation was still working out how much would be needed for next year but she seemed to indicate it might be less than the $ 1.89 billion pledged for 1996 .
