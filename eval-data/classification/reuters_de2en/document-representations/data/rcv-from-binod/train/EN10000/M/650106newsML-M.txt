dollar / mark may be set for a technical breakout on the upside , while dollar / yen -- eyeing the opposite direction -- has additional weakness in store , analysts said on Tuesday . 
dollar / mark tested an intermediate resistance at 1.7210 on Tuesday before closing at 1.7183 / 88 vs. 1.7125 / 35 at the open . 
&quot; Dollar / mark does look a bit constructive , &quot; said I.D.E.A. 
analyst Ben Morden . 
&quot; If you start breaking 1.7220 , dollar / mark could go back to 1.7340 , a congestion area that provided the trigger for 1.7423 , &quot; Morden said of the 39-month high set on Friday . 
Morden , while expecting dollar / mark to grind higher , could not rule out a technical breakout on the upside . 
&quot; The parameters are in place . 
you have a four-month rising channel bounded by 1.7450 marks , 1.6750 marks . 
that &apos;s pretty much dictating the current price range , &quot; the I.D.E.A. 
analyst said . 
&quot; On Friday , we were right next to the upper end of that channel and we &apos;ll go back there if mark / yen collapses . 
Morden said the target in such a breakout would be at 1.7686 , the high set on February 1994 . 
mark / yen may hold the key to dollar / mark if 65.17 -- the low on Monday -- gives way . 
Chartists said mark / yen , which has been retreating since a May 27 high at 69.13 , may not halt its slide until 64.00 . 
it &apos;s a 62-percent retracement from the low of 58.70 in April 1995 to the high of 75.87 in November 1996 , &quot; Morden said . 
&quot; If we test 65.20 again , the risk is 64.85 , and 64.00 the figure . 
further mark / yen weakness would help dollar / mark . 
&quot; You could see dollar / mark and dollar / yen go in opposite directions if mark / yen collapses further , &quot; Morden predicted . 
&quot; In dollar / yen , you typically have big moves and long consolidations , and we broke that trend on Monday . 
Morden said the downward risk for dollar / yen would be a breach of 110.55 that would lead to &quot; 109.20 , the 38-percent retracement of the move from 79.75 -- the post-World War II low set on April 19 , 1995 -- to 127.47 , the May 1 high . 
Morden also noted that 109.30 is the 100-week moving average -- another factor pointing to a pullback to that area . 
mark / Paris remains vulnerable amid doubts about the euro and fears that 3.3865 , a key retracement level , may give way . 
separately , chartists at MCM CurrencyWatch put mark / Swiss near-term resistance at 0.8430 and key support at 0.8350 . 
they did not rule out further weakness on dollar / Swiss -- mainly if 1.4385 support goes .
