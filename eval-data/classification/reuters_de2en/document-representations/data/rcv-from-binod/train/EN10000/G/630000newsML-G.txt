former U.S. senator George Mitchell , back in Northern Ireland to reopen peace talks , said on Monday he hoped they would find a new vigour to end the conflict . 
Mitchell , chairman of an Anglo-Irish sponsored initiative dogged by difficulties for ten months , said he believed more than ever that people &quot; do not want a return to the violence and the bitterness of the past &quot; . 
the talks start again on Tuesday . 
&quot; I believe the opportunity exists for substantial and substantive progress to be made in these talks , that &apos;s why I &apos;ve come back , &quot; he told reporters in Belfast , after a adjournment for the May 1 British election , which Labour won by a landslide . 
&quot; I do not operate under any illusion that differences don &apos;t exist , they clearly do , &quot; said Mitchell , who earlier had talks in London with new British Prime Minister Tony Blair . 
a weekend of violence in the province has provided a gloomy climate for the talks , which have achieved little apart from underlining the depths of mistrust between majority Protestants and minority Catholics . 
Belfast , for long a citadel of British power , elected its first Irish nationalist Catholic mayor on Monday after Protestant parties lost control in municipal council elections . 
Sinn Fein , the political arm of the IRA , made significant gains among the province &apos;s Catholics . 
the opening of the peace talks will undoubtedly be marked by noise and protests as Sinn Fein -- which has been banned from the peace talks until the guerrillas restore a ceasefire they broke last year -- tries unsuccessfully to be admitted . 
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said his movement -- which also benefited from an upswing of support in Britain &apos;s election -- had a right to take part . 
&quot; I am not going up ( to the talks ) to demand anything other than the rights of those people who voted for us ... I hope that we are allowed into the talks tomorrow , I hope that wiser counsel prevails , &quot; he told reporters . 
Blair &apos;s Labour government ended a freeze on ties with Sinn Fein after its crushing election win but made clear the door would be open only as long as the IRA desisted from violence . 
the IRA abandoned a large home-made bomb in Catholic west Belfast on Saturday which security sources said had been intended as a trap for troops and police . 
on Sunday an off-duty policeman was kicked to death in the latest upwelling of communal hatred . 
Protestant hardliners were blamed . 
U.S. President Bill Clinton , during a visit to London last Thursday , appealed to the IRA to &quot; lay down your guns for good &quot; so as to win a voice for its Sinn Fein political wing in talks . 
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton signalled he might re-impose a ban on meetings between officials and the Sinn Fein after the IRA bomb incident . 
contacts had been frozen since February 1996 when the Irish guerrillas set off a huge bomb in east London , killing two civilians and devastating property . 
Sinn Fein officials have held two rounds of inconclusive talks with British officials and a third is planned , but no date has yet been set .
