interbank rates were slightly lower on Monday morning after Bank Negara Malaysia imposed curbs on foreign exchange swaps in an effort to cool speculation in the ringgit , dealers said . 
&quot; Rates are coming off but not very much . 
I think many are still digesting Bank Negara &apos;s announcement and not doing anything yet , &quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank . 
on Sunday , Bank Negara said that from Monday , local banks will have to limit their non-trade related currency swaps to $ 2.0 million with each overseas customer . 
it said banks which have exceeded the limit will not be allowed further swap transactions until the outstandings were reduced . 
a swap is a forward rate agreement for exchanging one currency to another . 
Bank Negara said the move was to help control interest rates more effectively . 
the central bank has in the last two weeks been trying to lower interest rates in an effort to boost domestic economic activity . 
one-month money was at 8.3 percent from 8.6 / 7 percent , and three-month was at 8.0 / 3 percent against 8.3 / 5 percent . 
the overnight interbank rate , which closed at 8.5 percent on Friday , was expected to trade below 8.0 percent , dealers said . 
&quot; The market perception is that rates are heading lower , &quot; said another dealer . 
on Friday , Bank Negara had asked banks to hold their base lending rates steady despite the recent surge in interbank rates . 
interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were sharply up across the board to reflect softening in interbank rates , futures market dealers said . 
at 0215 GMT , the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank offered Rate ( KLIBOR ) September contract was up 15 points to 92.37 , or an implied yield of 7.63 percent . 
the December contract rose 11 to 92.61 , or 7.39 percent while March 1998 was up 10 to 92.70 , or 7.30 percent .
