formula quotation fob Med 20 / 25 20 / 25 
vacuum gas oil was broadly steady in Europe on Friday . 
a deal was heard concluded at $ 138 fob NWE for a 50,000 tonne cargo of low sulphur material which traders expected to head transatlantic . 
&quot; There had been rather optimisic talk of $ 142 , but I think this trade puts that to bed , &quot; said one trader . 
there was some market talk that $ 136 fob NWE had been done on Thursday , but news of the $ 138 deal led many in the market to question the earlier level . 
high sulphur vgo was quieter than low sulphur with Russian material building up in NWE .
