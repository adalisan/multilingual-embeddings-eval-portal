investment funds on Friday joined a renewed wave of purchasing for gasoline futures in the United States , pulling world oil prices higher . 
London benchmark Brent blend crude futures ended nine cents a barrel higher in a truncated trading session at $ 18.54 . 
Atlantic basin gasoline prices have shifted in to top gear over the past weeks , catching some traders by surprise after U.S. summer driving season demand got off to a slow start . 
&quot; There was a crush of fund buying in crude and gasoline , &quot; said a U.S. trader . 
Friday &apos;s higher prices defied earlier predictions that uncertainty over the U.N. &apos; s negotiations with Iraq over an aid distribution plan would prompt most players to enter the weekend with balanced positions . 
Iraq , which insists the aid plan be agreed before it resumes exporting crude under the U.N. &apos; s oil-for-food arrangement , has to present further documents to the U.N. this weekend . 
final approval by Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected some time next week . 
Iraq will need to export some two million barrels a day ( bpd ) to meet its initial billion dollar target for sales by September 7 , probably beyond its capacity .
