Zaire rebel leader Laurent Kabila on Tuesday rejected calls for pluralist elections to end Africa &apos;s latest war , saying polls could only be held after President Mobutu Sese Seko stepped down or was overthrown . 
Kabila , speaking shortly before talks with U.S. envoy Bill Richardson , told Reuters that even then Mobutu and his &quot; corrupt entourage cannot take part in such a process &quot; . 
Richardson told reporters on arrival in Lubumbashi earlier on Tuesday that elections and the rule of law were necessary to end the war in Africa &apos;s third largest country . 
but in hard-hitting remarks before meeting Richardson , Kabila said : &quot; There will be no compromise over the departure , through the battlefield or at talks , of Mobutu , his system and his henchmen . 
Kabila has agreed to meet Mobutu on a ship off the Atlantic coast to discuss the departure of Africa &apos;s longest serving ruler . 
Kabila said his troops were advancing on the road to Kinshasa after capturing the town of Kikwit on Tuesday .
