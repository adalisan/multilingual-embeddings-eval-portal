a bomb exploded outside a California Courthouse before dawn on Thursday , damaging the building and shattering windows of nearby businesses but causing no injuries , officials said . 
the explosion in Vallejo , 35 miles ( 50 km ) northeast of San Francisco , was the third bomb incident in the town in less than a week and it jangled the nerves of local residents who wondered who was behind the bombs . 
no one was injured in the 3 : 30 a.m. ( 1130 GMT ) blast at the Solano County Courthouse , but it blew a hole in the wall of the building and shattered dozens of windows in the Courthouse and in businesses across the street . 
in mid-morning , an anonymous caller telephoned the Courthouse in Fairfield , about 20 miles ( 32 kms ) from Vallejo , and said a bomb was planted there , David Robinson , a spokesman for the Solano County Sheriff &apos;s Department , said . 
the building and a nearby sheriff &apos;s office were evacuated while a bomb-sniffing dog checked the premises , he said . 
there was no word of anything being found . 
authorities did not know the motive for the court bombing , Robinson said . 
&quot; We &apos;re looking at every angle you can think of at this point , &quot; he told reporters in Vallejo . 
early last Sunday , a bomb exploded near a Wells Fargo bank branch in Vallejo , damaging automated teller machines but causing no injuries . 
on Saturday , a bomb disposal team disactivated a large bomb found by two children next to a public library that also houses a police evidence room . 
police said the library bomb contained at least 30 sticks of dynamite and was powerful enough to have caused extensive damage and many injuries . 
Robinson said investigators did not yet know whether the three explosives incidents were related , but he said there were &quot; some similarities . 
police released a picture taken by a surveillance camera at the Wells Fargo bank that was bombed at the weekend . 
it showed a figure who they believe could be the bomber . 
Vallejo Mayor Gloria Exline said Air Force experts in enhancing videotapes had helped in the investigation . 
Vallejo residents were either worried or indignant about the bombings in the normally quiet town . 
it seems like a stupid thing to be doing , &quot; chip Carter , owner of a Vallejo business where several windows were shattered by Thursday &apos;s blast , told a local television station . 
authorities sealed off a two-square-block area of downtown Vallejo while they combed the ground for clues . 
a wire was found leading from the blast site across the street , Robinson said . 
investigators found a car battery near the other end of the wire , but they did not yet know whether it was used to detonate the bomb , he said . 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms were involved in the probe .
