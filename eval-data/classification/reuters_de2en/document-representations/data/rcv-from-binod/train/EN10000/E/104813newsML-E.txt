the Central Bank of Kenya &apos;s governor hosted an &quot; annual &quot; lunch for the first time in three years on Wednesday as proof Kenya &apos;s economy was back in shape after reforms . 
Micah Cheserem was appointed governor in 1993 when poor financial discipline meant the central bank had lost money for the first time in Kenya &apos;s history and corruption at the bank had allowed some commercial banks credit beyond legal limits . 
on Wednesday , Cheserem gave Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi a cheque for 7.3 billion shillings ( $ 130 million ) as dividend payable to the exchequer in 1995 / 96 and trumpeted the central bank &apos;s objective of keeping inflation at a single digit and managing a stable banking system . 
Eric Kotut , who resigned in disgrace as governor following a corruption scandal to pave way for Cheserem , and Vice-President George Saitoti , also finance minister to 1993 and widely blamed for doing little to enforce financial discipline , were there . 
&quot; The managers of our financial sector now realise the importance of prudence and integrity in financial operations , which have enhanced the confidence of the public in financial institutions , &quot; said Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi . 
Mudavadi said wide-ranging reforms had allowed the growth of capital markets with the result that &quot; with the exception of Johannesburg Stock Exchange , the Nairobi Stock Exchange is today the most active and developed market in sub-Saharan Africa &quot; . 
the Nairobi bourse is capitalised at $ 1.89 billion . 
Mudavadi said improvements in tax administration had boosted revenue collections and , with expenditure restraint exercised by the government , it was now possible for the economic guardians to reduce government borrowing from the domestic market . 
&quot; Inflation has been kept in check , the external value of the shilling has stabilised , foreign exchange reserves are now at a comfortable level and per capita income has begun to grow . 
the Kenyan economy is now on a higher growth path and we can soon achieve 6-7 percent annual rates of growth , &quot; Mudavadi said . 
Moi said Kenya &apos;s economy had responded well to reforms , pointing to a decline in fiscal deficit to 1.4 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) in 1995 / 96 from 11.4 percent in 1992 / 93 . 
he said the central bank had cut down money supply growth from 26 percent in 1994 to 15 percent in 1995 &quot; and such developments mean real growth in domestic income &quot; . 
Moi said the sale of government companies was on schedule and of 207 earmarked for sale , 114 had already been sold . 
economists however argued the government had been slow in selling big concerns such as the telecommunications and posts company and the railways . 
they also said the government was also slow in commercialising the state pension agency NSSF . 
Moi spoke of a five-year programme to improve power supply in Kenya by the construction of five new power stations -- two by the private sector . 
these five would add 338 megawatts to the existing capacity in the next four years , he said . 
Kenya has a power deficit of 50 megawatts . 
the system &apos;s peak demand is 670 megawatts while available capacity is 620 megawatts , according to the Kenya Power &amp; lighting Company . 
Moi urged commercial banks to lower lending rates , which are in the 26-33 percent range , to spur borrowing for investment . 
he said the government was seeking measures to lower its own interest on treasury bills , now in the range of 18-24 percent .
