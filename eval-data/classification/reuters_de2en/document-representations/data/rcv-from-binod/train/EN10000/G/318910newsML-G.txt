with China voting in favour , the U.N. Security Council on Monday approved 155 U.N. military observers to monitor peace accords in Guatemala that ended three decades of civil war . 
the vote , the second one taken on Guatemala in the council in 10 days , was a unanimous 15-0 . 
China , which had vetoed a similar resolution on Jan . 10 because of Guatemala &apos;s ties to Taiwan , supported Monday &apos;s document after intensive negotiations with Guatemala and other countries . 
it was unclear what compromise Guatemala had made with Beijing in their week-long secret talks . 
but diplomats said one element of an agreement between the two countries was that Guatemala promised to refrain from co-sponsoring an annual , unsuccessful General Assembly resolution aimed at securing U.N. membership for Taiwan . 
Beijing did not object to the peacekeeping mission itself but was reacting to Guatemala &apos;s diplomatic and other ties with Taiwan , regarded by China as a renegade province . 
Taipei was expelled from the world body in 1971 and replaced by Beijing as the rightful representative of China . 
for the past four years Guatemala has been among a number of small countries , mainly from Central America , the Caribbean and Africa , which have sought the inscription of a new General Assembly agenda item aimed at establishing a committee to consider U.N. membership for Taiwan . 
Taipei has given generous aid to these countries . 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan attended the council meeting , indicating the significance of the vote . 
he said he was &quot; most gratified &quot; to learn that obstacles that stood in the way of deployment of the military observers &quot; have been overcome . 
Costa Rica &apos;s Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo represented Central American states in the council to express appreciation of the deal . 
China , in its speech , gave few clues about what the deal was . 
its ambassador , Qin Huasun , said : &quot; The two sides , guided by the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter and in a forward-looking pragmatic approach , have finally found a solution acceptable to both sides , thereby removing the obstacles to China &apos;s support for the relevant draft resolution . 
&quot; We positiviely appraise the constructive move taken by Guatemala , &quot; he added . 
under the peace agreements , the Guatemalan army is to cut its numbers and about 3,000 guerrillas from the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit ( URNG ) are to go to assembly points , disarm and be integrated into civilian life . 
the process was to have begun later this week and be monitored by the military observers , who will now take weeks longer to arrive . 
China never demanded in any of its talks that Guatemala break off diplomatic ties with Taiwan as a price for getting the peacekeepers , although that is its ultimate goal , diplomats said . 
but Beijing was evidently successful in getting some concessions from Guatemala on Taiwan and made its point on the issue to world . 
in Guatemala , however , Deputy Foreign Relations Minister Gabriel Aguilera said his country did not promise to stop supporting moves to put U.N. membership for Taiwan on the U.N. General Assembly &apos;s agenda . 
&quot; It is premature to indicate what position our delegation would take , &quot; said Aguilera , without giving any details of the deal that Guatemala had made with China .
