German shares posted modest gains as they reopened after a one-day break on Friday , with firm buying interest in carmaker Volkswagen the highlight of an otherwise lacklustre session . 
the blue chip DAX index rose 22.30 points , or 0.7 percent , to close the bourse session at 3,460.37 points . 
activity was limited after Thursday &apos;s May Day holiday and as the market awaited April payroll data due from the U.S. at 1230 GMT on Friday , but dealers said liquidity should pick up next week and many expected fresh record highs . 
&quot; With any luck the U.S. news will be good and that should set us off . 
car shares remained in the spotlight as VW notched up an advance of more than five percent to close at 1,157 marks , up 56 marks . 
Daimler-Benz rose 3.10 marks , or 2.4 percent , to 131.70 while BMW advanced 43 marks , or three percent , to 1,461 marks . 
no single factor appeared to be behind the interest in VW but dealers said the dollar &apos;s continued strength and technical buy signals were fuelling the gains . 
&quot; Car shares are simply in vogue at the moment , &quot; said another dealer . 
the DAX-100 car share index , which tracks auto shares among Germany &apos;s top 100 listed companies , rose 3.1 percent , versus an advance of 0.6 percent for the DAX-100 as a whole . 
pharmaceutical group Schering AG , extending gains from Wednesday after it announced plans to buy back its own shares , rose 3.40 marks to 169.40 . 
the resounding victory of Britain &apos;s Labour Party in the general election , ending 18 years of Conservative rule , had little impact on shares here . 
economists said that while Labour &apos;s approach towards Europe would be less hostile than that of the Conservatives , policy would not change much in the foreseeable future .
