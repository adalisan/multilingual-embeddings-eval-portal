a pregnant Albanian woman has died of polio , raising to three the number of deaths from the disease since the current outbreak was first detected in June , a leading Albanian physicist said on Friday . 
Kristo Pano , senior doctor at Tirana &apos;s hospital for infectious diseases , said a 20-year-old woman from Maqellare in northeast Albania had died on Thursday , five days after she was hospitalised . 
two teenage girls died earlier this month in the polio outbreak affecting central and northern Albania . 
more than 20 people are known to be suffering from the disease . 
Pano said he could not say if the outbreak could be contained because the country was facing an extremely rare situation which had puzzled even the World Health Organisation . 
he explained the disease had originated from children who had received polio vaccinations and then passed on the virus in faeces to persons with weak immune systems or those who had either been partially vaccinated or had received no vaccination at all . 
about 700,000 Albanian children up to five years old received polio vaccinations in April and May . 
&quot; We cannot be scientifically sure . 
logic would have it that there would be fewer cases but they would be more serious since the virus increases its virulence when it passes from one person to the other , &quot; he said . 
Pano agreed with comments by Health Minister Maksim Cikuli , saying there were more cases than medical literature envisaged where vaccine viruses were found to be the cause .
