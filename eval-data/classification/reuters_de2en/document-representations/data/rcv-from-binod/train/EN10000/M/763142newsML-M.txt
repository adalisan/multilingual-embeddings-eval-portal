most U.S. debt futures ended slightly to moderately higher after the long end slowly built gains much of the afternoon . 
some brokers figured futures had priced in on Monday afternoon the U.S. balanced budget agreement . 
but others said futures drifted higher Tuesday as details of the plan , which contains the first big tax cuts in 16 years , became clear . 
&quot; I think the more encouraging the ( budget ) news is , the more buying we &apos;ve seen , &quot; said a Eurodollar floor broker of the legislation , which President Clinton called an historic agreement . 
White House chief of staff said he expected most Democrats would vote for the package , and Republican leaders said they expected most of their members would vote for both the spending bill and the tax cuts . 
September Treasury bond futures expanded its gains when one dealer bought about 1,000 contracts , forcing short locals to cover . 
the buying also triggered small paper buystops near 115-28 / 32 as the contract rose to the pit session &apos;s peak of 115-31 / 32 , where some said a good offer helped stall the rise . 
many pundits still look for more upside soon , although they said T-bonds might trudge rather than sprint higher . 
&quot; There &apos;s plenty more room to go ( higher ) , &quot; said one T-bond futures floor chartist . 
he said a rise above Tuesday &apos;s peak likely would allow futures to head to 116-08 / 32 , while support would come in around 115-12 / 32 on downward corrections . 
others pegged support at 115-08 / 32 , which nearby futures held during Tuesday morning &apos;s early pullback and which provided a platform for its work back upward as buyers continued to scoop up pullbacks , brokers added . 
in Eurodollars , brokers said the market worked inside a familiar intraday range , although December futures on a daily basis have returned toward their mid-February highs . 
the second-quarter ECI rose 0.8 percent , matching forecasts , while the first-quarter rise stayed at 0.6 percent . 
slippage in July U.S. consumer confidence to 126.5 from a revised 129.9 June added slight lift as well . 
traders had expected July at 130.4 . 
Sept T-bonds rose 16 / 32 to 115-30 / 32 , 10-yr notes gained 10 / 32 to 110-16 / 32 , munis rose 17 / 32 to 121-18 / 32 , Dec T-bills added 0.020 to 94.845 , and Dec Eurodollars rose 0.015 to 94.155 .
