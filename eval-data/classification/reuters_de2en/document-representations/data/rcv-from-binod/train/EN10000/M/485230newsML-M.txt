light buying amid a shortage of supply bolstered the prices of U.S. fixed-rate pass-through securities on Thursday , traders said . 
additionally , they said some secondary market players got a chance to sink their teeth into a $ 616 million adjustable Rate Mortgage ( arm ) bid list , released earlier in the afternoon . 
&quot; Several people have sold the list and the market has been focused on that , &quot; one trader in New York said . 
nevertheless , buyers of fixed-rate mortgages kept yield spreads to treasuries slightly tighter since there was a lack of supply from mortgage bankers , traders said . 
&quot; ( spreads ) have tightened rather dramatically the last couple of days and they were ... a little tighter today , &quot; one trader said . 
specifically , Ginnie Mae 30-year 8.0 percent coupons were up 1 / 32 at 100-25 / 32 bid , yielding 118 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note . 
comparable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issues were 1 / 32 higher as well , at 100-24 / 32 bid and 100-30 / 32 bid , respectively . 
the five-year Treasury note was unchanged at 99-20 / 32 bid to yield 6.71 percent , while the 10-year Treasury note was 2 / 32 higher to yield 6.86 percent . 
mortgage sources said many traders were sidelined until Friday &apos;s March jobs data , waiting to see if treasuries break out of their trading range . 
&quot; If people get comfortable that we are in a trading range , I think spreads will be fine , &quot; the source said . 
&quot; If people get the feeling that the ( Federal Reserve ) is going to have to tighten again , sooner rather than later , I think that will put pressure on ( mortgages ) .
