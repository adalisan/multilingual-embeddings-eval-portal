British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown is set to tighten fiscal policy by around 7.0 billion pounds , or one percent , in his July 2 budget , according to Michael Dicks , UK economist at Lehman Brothers . 
but this will not be enough to quash Bank of England fears that domestic demand is growing too fast and the central bank will raise interest rates to a peak of 7.5 percent , Dicks said in his budget preview . 
but these fiscal and monetary measures would still not be sufficient to slow growth , he said , so Brown will have to revisit the fiscal stance either in the November budget or next spring . 
Dicks said raising taxes was essential if Brown was to build a reputation for fiscal prudence . 
&quot; If ( Brown ) wants to build a reputation for prudence then he seems to have little alternative but to raise taxes . 
for only by doing this will he be able to present a convincing argument that the PSBR will continue to drop towards the &apos; golden rule &apos; target . 
top of the list of budget measures , Dicks forecasts Brown will elect to raise more from the windfall tax on privatised utilities than is needed to fund the welfare-to-work programme , which subsidises firms to take on unemployed young people . 
the government has said the programme will cost 3.0 billion pounds , but Brown could easily tap the sector for another 3.0 billion or so , Dicks said . 
in addition , Brown may cut the rate of advanced corporation tax ( ACT ) from 20 percent to 10 percent and use only a small fraction of this to encourage investment or research and development . 
these changes could raise a further 2.0 billion stg . 
in the personal sector , Dicks forecasts either a cut in mortgage interest relief or a hike in stamp duty , which could raise another 1.0 billion pounds . 
&quot; He could also raise &apos; green &apos; or &apos; sin &apos; taxes . 
the landfill tax introduced in 1995 might well be raised . 
the flat rate vehicle excise duty might be replaced by a dual system to discourage high emission vehicles . 
and taxes on alcohol , fuel and tobacco could all go up , &quot; said Dicks . 
a combination of those measures could raise a further 1.0 billion pounds , Dicks said . 
he also expects Brown will take the opportunity to signal changes he is considering for future budgets , including a review of the tax and benefit system which is set to be redesigned to help improve incentives .
