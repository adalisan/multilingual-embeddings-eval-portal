Tajikistan protested to the United Nations on Thursday against alleged violations by Islamic rebels of a provisional truce signed on Wednesday in northern Afghanistan , a presidential spokesman said . 
&quot; There was shooting in the town of Garm this morning when the opposition attacked our battalion , &quot; spokesman Zafar Saidov told Reuters . 
&quot; We are going to issue a note of protest to the U.N. special representative in Tajikistan , Gerd Merren . 
Tajikistan &apos;s President Imamali Rakhmonov and opposition leader Sayid Abdullo Nuri agreed on a ceasefire from midnight on Wednesday during their talks in northern Afghanistan . 
Russia &apos;s Interfax news agency quoted Tajik officials as saying that two soldiers of the battalion besieged by opposition rebels in Garm , 150 km ( 100 miles ) east of the capital Dushanbe , had been killed and another three wounded during the rebel attack on Thursday . 
Russia &apos;s Itar-Tass news agency quoted a Tajik foreign ministry statement as saying that if the opposition continued its attacks the government would have to respond . 
TASS said Merren had informed Nuri about Rakhmonov &apos;s protest . 
forces loyal to communist Rakhmonov defeated their opponents in a civil war in 1992 and forced them to flee to neighbouring Afghanistan . 
the opposition has waged a guerrilla war against Rakhmonov since then and won some territory earlier this year .
