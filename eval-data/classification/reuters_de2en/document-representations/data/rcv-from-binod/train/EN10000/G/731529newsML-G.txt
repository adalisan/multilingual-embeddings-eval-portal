Craig Masback , a man whose resume seems a perfect fit for the job , was named Wednesday as the new Chief Executive Officer of USA Track &amp; Field . 
Masback , a corporate and sports attorney for a Washington law firm , has worked as a track and field television commentator since 1982 and is a former international miler . 
&quot; As of today , USA Track &amp; Field is open to ideas , open for business and open to change , &quot; said the 42-year-old Masback , who was introduced as U.S. track &apos;s new chief at a news conference Wednesday . 
Masback , hired through the year 2001 , replaces outgoing CEO Ollan Cassell , whose contract was not renewed at last December &apos;s USATF annual meeting . 
Cassell had served as U.S. athletics &apos; top official since 1965 . 
Masback takes over the reins of a sport that struggles for attention against the major U.S. professional sports such as baseball , basketball and football . 
this season two of the three U.S. grand Prix were called off due to sponsorship problems . 
indoor meets have also fallen from the schedule . 
&quot; Those meets are the jewels in our crown , &quot; said Masback . 
&quot; We need to strengthen the meets we already have and add others . 
&quot; Those track meets are our face to the media and the public . 
if we can &apos;t provide that exposure , we &apos;re not going to hook them ( young athletes ) and have them stay in our sport and develop the next Edwin Moses . 
Masback said U.S. athletes , who claimed 13 gold medals at the Atlanta Olympics , were eager to support initiatives to build domestic popularity in the sport . 
&quot; We have to forge a partnership with our athletes , &quot; said Masback , who stressed the need for better marketing . 
&quot; We &apos;re going to have to be more professional and they &apos;re going to have to be more professional . 
I &apos;ll be glad to give athletes a stake in building the sport . 
Masback said prize money was an overdue development in track and field and that incentives for athletes was something that commanded the attention of the public . 
&quot; This is a professional sport . 
not everyone understands that , &quot; he said . 
&quot; That is something the public can grab onto and understand . 
Masback bemoaned the lack of U.S. media coverage of the sport , saying &quot; Michael Johnson &apos;s first 400 meters loss in eight years three weeks ago in Paris barely got a mention in U.S. newspapers , while the $ 150,000 Hamburg Open tennis tournament got a few paragraphs and agate in all the papers . 
he acknowledged the benefits of wildcard berths given to defending champions for the world championships in Athens , but said it provided a challenge for U.S. organisers . 
&quot; There &apos;s no question sponsors are thrilled that Michael Johnson and Gwen Torrance will take part in Athens , &quot; he said , before adding that the awarding of wildcards presented the danger that some big names could skip national championships . 
&quot; What we need to do is forge such a strong relationship with our athletes that they are eager to perform in our national events . 
Masback &apos;s duties include managing the sport &apos;s 56 local associations , 140 national championships and 100,000 members ranging from youth to Masters competitors . 
he said one of his major goals would be the marketing of major meets and development of major television contracts . 
Masback was the 1980 U.S. indoor mile champion and former U.S. record holder at 2,000 meters and competed on the 1985 U.S. team that won the World Cup in Canberra , Australia . 
his first of 30 sub-four-minute miles came at the Iffley Road Track in Oxford , England , where he became the second man to break four minutes on the track , 24 years after Roger Bannister &apos;s legendary run shattered the four-minute barrier . 
Masback also worked from 1982-84 in Lausanne for the International Olympic Committee as an assistant to the Director of the Olympic Museum .
