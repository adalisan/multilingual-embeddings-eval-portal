September Nikkei futures fell 270 points , closing at 20 280 . 
the markets were closed on Monday . 
&quot; U.S. stocks have entered an adjustment phase led by technology issues , &quot; said Yasuo Ueki , Nikko Securities general manager . 
&quot; Japanese high-tech stocks , especially pricey ones in the 10,000 yen area , may fall out of favour , &quot; he added . 
&quot; But currencies are fairly stable with the yen a little on the weak side against the dollar and declines by the indices should be fairly limited . 
brokers added that , as the U.S. stock market was showing volatility , investors were opting to wait for the outcome of the Greenspan testimony before trading .
