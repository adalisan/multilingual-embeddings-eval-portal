Pakistani stocks , which have shed 286 points since the release of a tax-packed federal budget on June 13 , are likely to be hit further in months ahead by political unrest and a troubled economy , brokers said . 
the teetering Karachi Stock Exchange ( KSE ) 100-share index will remain under pressure in the next quarter and is likely to sink below the 1,400-point support level , they said . 
&quot; The worse is not yet over , said Manochar Jamal , chief dealer of Taurus Securities . 
&quot; The opposition parties &apos; anti-government movement and a hard-pressed economy offers little attraction for local and foreign investors . 
the KSE index dropped 3.42 points , or 0.24 percent , on Thursday , the last trading day before the Moslem weekend , hitting a new year-low at 1,418.57 amid a record eight-month low trading volume of 12.77 million shares . 
&quot; With local institutions hit by an acute liquidity crunch and foreign investors on the sidelines , trading volumes have gradually dwindled and hardly six or seven speculative scrips are generating activity , &quot; Jamal said . 
dealers said the inflow of foreign funds shrunk due to the rise in U.S. interest rates . 
continued depreciation of the Pakistani rupee also remains a key dampening factor for the stock market . 
&quot; For average investors , there is no sense in investing in the stock market , &quot; Mumtaz Kazmi of Global Securities said . 
&quot; With the rupee &apos;s continued downslide , the dollar offers a better investment . 
the rupee has fallen 1.48 percent against the dollar since July 1 , the start of fiscal 1996 / 97 ( July / June ) , while it lost 13.2 percent in the previous year . 
brokers say another major factor depressing Pakistani stocks is the 1996 / 97 budget , in which Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto &apos;s government imposed new taxes of 42.08 billion rupees to cut the deficit to 4.0 percent from more than 5.0 percent in 1995 / 96 . 
&quot; New taxes have hit the private sector , &quot; dealer Ather Raouf of Carr Mashriq said . 
&quot; Those who pay taxes have been burdened with more taxes bearing a negative impact on market sentiment . 
&quot; The index has continued to slip since the budget was announced while the government todate is unable to finalise its figures owing to concessions given to various interest groups . 
a delay by the International Monetary Fund in disbursing its third tranche from a $ 600 million standby loan to Pakistan has also shaken investor confidence . 
payments were due in June . 
the IMF has indicated it will not review Pakistan &apos;s economic policies until Bhutto &apos;s government finalises its budget figures . 
&quot; Investors will remain in a wait-and-see mood until the fate of the IMF &apos;s standby loan is decided , &quot; one analyst said . 
&quot; A clean chit of approval to the government &apos;s financial policies by the IMF can prove a shot in the arm for the ailing Pakistani economy and revive investors &apos; confidence . 
market analysts say investment choices among Pakistani stocks would also remain limited in the short to medium term . 
sectors which looked attractive in 1994 , when the index peaked at a dizzying 2,600 points , are not exciting any more , said Farooq Lakhani of International Asset Management Co . 
Financials , for example , had exhausted their growth potential , he said . 
only select fuel and energy stocks and fertiliser , communications and pharmaceutical companies will generate limited interest and a turnaround in index in early 1997 will be more on technicals rather than fundamentals , dealers said .
