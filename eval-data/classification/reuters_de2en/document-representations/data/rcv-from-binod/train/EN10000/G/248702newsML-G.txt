Sudanese opposition leader and former prime minister Sadeq al-Mahdi , in a sudden switch of strategy against the Khartoum government , has left Sudan for Eritrea , the headquarters of the armed opposition . 
Mahdi appeared at a news conference in Asmara on Wednesday and said he slipped out of Khartoum last Thursday . 
asked what his plans were , he said : &quot; I want a united effort against the regime in Khartoum , with a minimum of bloodshed . 
Mahdi , great-grandson of the Sudanese Mahdi who rebelled against Egyptian imperialism in the 1880s , is a towering figure in Sudanese politics as head of the Umma , the largest party , and spiritual leader of the Ansar or Mahdist movement . 
his flight from Khartoum is a major coup for the National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) , the broad opposition coalition that has started attacking Sudan from Eritrean territory . 
Eritrea , which says Sudan &apos;s Islamic government is trying to destabilise the region , supports the Sudanese rebels in their campaign against the government . 
Mahdi had been living in Khartoum , sometimes in jail and sometimes under surveillance at home , since Lieutenant-General Omar Hassan al-Bashir overthrew his democratically elected government in a military coup in 1989 . 
he has been an outspoken opponent of the Islamist government but he has not overtly supported the use of violence . 
&quot; For a long time people have advised that I should deprive the regime of using me as a human shield . 
we left on the morning of last Thursday , in defence of ourselves . 
we met no obstruction . 
there was a total blindness from the government side . 
it was very , very safe , &quot; he added . 
asked if his departure meant he had dropped his reservations about the use of violence to overthrow Bashir , he said : 
my future actions will be guided by their ( the Sudanese government &apos;s ) reaction to this memorandum . 
Sudanese state television on Wednesday night quoted the minister of culture and information , Brigadier Al-Tayeb Ibrahim Mohamed Khair , as saying Mahdi was unimportant and his departure would not aid the opposition . 
Mahdi said that since arriving in Asmara he had contact with friends in neighbouring countries and at the Organisation of African Unity . 
next he will hold talks with the leaders of the NDA , he added . 
speaking of his life in Khartoum , he said : &quot; lately I have been tailed everywhere . 
the security has said that &apos; Everything that happens to the government , we shall hold you responsible &apos; . 
the regime is simply seeking to use myself and others as human shields . 
he said the Khartoum government , dominated by his brother-in-law , Islamist ideologue Hassan al-Turabi , had failed to carry out the reforms it promised after the coup . 
&quot; In the last two years there have been at least six attempted coups and two popular uprisings , in September 1995 and in September 1996 . 
some Sudanese have already taken up arms . 
&quot; Sudan is internally and externally isolated . 
it has gained them a number of condemning resolutions by the U.N. General Assembly and the Security Council , and sanctions by the Security Council , &quot; he added . 
the Security Council last month delayed until the end of a December a decision on implementing an air embargo against Sudan for failing to extradite three men wanted for an attempt to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa last year .
