Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan signalled on Thursday that the central bank was inching toward raising interest rates , possibly as soon as next week . 
in prepared testimony to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress , Greenspan said the economy retains a &quot; great deal of vigor &quot; and the jobs market is strong . 
the central bank &apos;s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday to consider raising short-term rates for the first time in over two years . 
&quot; Should we choose to alter monetary policy , we know from past experience that , although the financial markets may respond immediately , the main effects on inflationary pressures may not be felt until late this year and in 1998 , &quot; Greenspan said . 
he said the Fed must weigh the risks and benefits of any policy stance , including leaving rates unchanged . 
as he has done before , Greenspan stressed the importance of the Fed acting promptly -- or ideally , preemptively -- to keep inflation low . 
much of Greenspan &apos;s testimony seemed aimed at preparing lawmakers -- who have often been critical of Fed policy in the past -- for the possibility of a rate increase as soon as next week . 
at its meeting on Tuesday , the FOMC will have to judge whether the strong pace of the economic expansion will continue and what impact that might eventually have on inflation , Greenspan said . 
&quot; Demand has been growing quite strongly in recent months , &quot; the Fed chief said . 
&quot; The prospects for sustaining the expansion are quite favourable . 
he singled out the jobs market in particular for special monitoring and said that a further fall in the unemployment rate would increase the risks of higher wages and ultimately prices .
