emerging market debt prices got whacked by tumbling U.S. treasuries on Thursday . 
strong economic data reported Thursday morning sent the benchmark 30-year bond yield shooting up to 6.96 percent , the U.S. stock market and other interest rate sensitive financial assets were all taking a beating , traders said . 
spreads of Latin Brady bonds over U.S. treasuries widened by 20 basis points or more , they said . 
&quot; lots of rumors , lots of confusion , &quot; said a chief trader , describing the pandemonium in late morning . 
the selloff was triggered by a higher-than-expected 0.8 percent rise in retail sales on the heel of an upwardly revised 1.5 percent in January and a small 307,000 initial jobless claims in the week ended March 8 , they said . 
in general , par bonds suffered more than discounts in the falling market , but some discounts fell more in the selloff today , he said , noting : &quot; Prices were all over the places . 
&quot; The rise in the cost of money made margin investments less profitable , said another trader . 
&quot; You see retreat across the board , &quot; he said . 
but selling pressure relented in the afternoon , giving hopes that the market might have found a temporary bottom . 
&quot; We don &apos;t think there &apos;d be much followthrough ( selling ) on Friday , &quot; he said . 
Venezuela bonds were weak at the start of the U.S. session amid nernvousness over social unrest . 
in the general selloff , however , Venezuela &apos;s decline was in sync with other Latin papers , traders said . 
Carlos Janada , analyst at Morgan Stanley , expected the social unrest to last for a few more weeks as a compromise on the wage dispute gets worked out . 
even if the government agrees to a sharply higher wage increase , the impact on inflation may not be as severe because the Venezuelan industry has plenty of unused capacity . 
&quot; There &apos;s no strong supply constraint , &quot; he said . 
Venezuela &apos;s President Rafael Caldera , in an address to Congress , pledged to continue with an economic reform program launched a year ago . 
while short on specifics over the reform , Caldera &apos;s reiteration of the commitment apparently was reassuring to the market , he said . 
Russia &apos;s 2.0 Deutchemark denominated eurobond was reoffered at 370 basis points over Bund , which some U.S. traders thought was on the wide side . 
the spread was talked in the range of 330 to 375 earlier in the week .
