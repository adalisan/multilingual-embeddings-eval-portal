Japan &apos;s Finance Minister Wataru Kubo told a news conference on Wednesday that he believes that the Bank of Japan &apos;s ( BOJ ) interest rate policy which is geared towards ensuring economic growth has not changed after the release of the central bank &apos;s &quot; tankan &quot; survey . 
the BOJ released the August tankan , its quarterly short-term corporate survey , in the morning and it showed business outlook had worsened . 
however , Kubo said it did not necessarily show a substantial worsening of the economy . 
&quot; The question is what the BOJ is going to do with its interest rate policy . 
asked if a supplementary budget for 1996 / 97 was needed to support the economy , Kubo said the tankan results would not lead to any immediate decision on the need for an extra budget . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think we should immediately draw a conclusion that the economic recovery has come to a halt or that signs of a economic contraction have emerged , &quot; Kubo said . 
&quot; The economy is not recovering smoothly or at a fast pace . 
Kubo said he would make a decision on the need for a supplementary budget after an announcement in mid-September of Japan &apos;s gross domestic product for the April-June quarter . 
&quot; I would like to see how the economy moved in the first half of 1996 , &quot; he said .
