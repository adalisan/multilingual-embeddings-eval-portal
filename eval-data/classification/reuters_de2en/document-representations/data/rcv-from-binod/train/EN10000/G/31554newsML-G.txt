authorities in Mali &apos;s capital Bamako have banned a march in support of African immigrants in France which human rights groups and other organisations had planned for Wednesday . 
the organisers said Bamako District Governor Lieutenant Colonel Karamoko Niare had written to them saying the timing of the march to the French embassy and the prime minister &apos;s office was inopportune . 
&quot; The question , in view of its extreme sensitivity , is currently the subject of particular attention from the country &apos;s highest authorities , &quot; the letter said . 
a two-month protest by 300 Africans in a Paris church focused public attention on the illegal immigration issue . 
reforms introduced in 1993 have meant some Africans who had been living in France legally are no longer entitled to stay . 
police cleared the church in a raid on August 23 , and since then France has chartered planes to deport more than 100 Africans , most of them from Mali , Senegal and Zaire . 
the Malian human rights association and several civic groups met last week to plan a series of protests , including Wednesday &apos;s march . 
they have called for a visit by French Cooperation Minister Jacques Godfrain later this month to be cancelled .
