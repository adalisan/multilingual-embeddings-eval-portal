the Justice Department has found that FBI agents who interviewed Richard Jewell about last summer &apos;s Olympic bombing committed an error in judgment but were guilty of no criminal misconduct , a newspaper reported ( on Tuesday . 
the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said an April 1 memo from the office of FBI Director Louis Freeh shows that a Justice Department probe of the bombing investigation found no evidence that agents from the FBI &apos;s Atlanta office violated Jewell &apos;s constitutional rights during an interview on the day he was named a suspect . 
FBI officials were not immediately available for comment on the newspaper report . 
last week , four agents from Atlanta , including the special agent in charge , were told they may be disciplined for their roles in the case . 
the FBI interviewed Jewell on July 30 , three days after a 40-pound pipe bomb packed with nails ripped through a crowd at an outdoor concert in downtown Atlanta , leaving two people dead and more than 100 injured . 
Jewell &apos;s attorneys have alleged that agents tricked their client into talking to interrogators by saying they wanted his help in making a training film . 
Jewell claims the FBI tried to get him to waive his rights . 
&quot; No one is claiming that the use of a ruse to encourage a suspect to talk is necessarily improper , &quot; the newspaper quoted the memo as saying . 
&quot; Putting aside anyone &apos;s personal responsibility for that mistake , I can tell you that no prosecutor could go into court , and no director of the FBI could go before Congress , and claim that necessary constitutional warnings are adequately conveyed by telling a suspect that he is an actor in a training video and that he is being presented Miranda warnings &apos; just like it &apos;s a real official interview , &apos; &quot; the document continued . 
the newspaper said the memo was written by Michael DeFeo , head of the FBI &apos;s Office of Professional Responsibility . 
Jewell was working as a security guard at centennial Olympic Park during an outdoor concert when he noticed the military-style backpack that contained the bomb . 
he reported the suspicious looking package to police . 
the device then detonated as he helped clear concert-goers from the area . 
Jewell initially was hailed as a hero . 
but he soon became the only named suspect in the investigation , though he was never charged with any crime . 
after spending three months being hounded by the FBI and the new media , Jewell was publicly exonerated of any suspicion by the Justice Department .
