French bond futures reversed part of Thursday &apos;s losses to go into a long-weekend in France slightly higher while the franc benefitted from a slide in the mark against the dollar and other European currencies . 
traders said reassuring words about monetary union from Bank of France governor Jean-Claude Trichet buoyed sentiment and provided an excuse for buying even though he said little new . 
after the initial rally , the September contract traded in a subdued range until a decline in U.S. June producer price figures sparked a brief spike higher . 
however the higher prices simply attracted profit-taking ahead of the weekend . 
some traders did not rule out a continuation of the rise in U.S. bonds and said that this could prompt a correction higher when the French market opens for trading again on Tuesday . 
Stuart Thomson , chief market economist at Credit agricole Indosuez , said benign U.S. inflation figures were unlikely to have a major positive impact on bonds and investors were focusing more on activity in the consumer sector . 
it &apos;s not going to make the ( Federal Reserve ) cut rates and since not going to make them raise rates it &apos;s less important , &quot; he said . 
&quot; If ( U.S. retail sales figures ) are well behaved the curve will continue to flatten , &quot; Thomson said . 
analysts and traders said the German government &apos;s announcement that its 1997 budget deficit plans predicted a gap amounting to three percent of gross domestic product had little impact as few believed the politicians . 
&quot; They &apos;ll always keep three percent as a political target and the markets just accept they will overshoot , &quot; Philippe Brossard , head of research at ABN AMRO Finance said . 
&quot; It &apos;s too confusing to trade on . 
&quot; I &apos;m sceptical because with all the numbers we had in May and June it suggested the overshoot might by enormous and now , miraculously , it &apos;s all settled without a severe tax increase , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Maybe the problem was a bit less severe , but I still cannot see how they &apos;ll get to three percent . 
the French franc climbed with other European currencies against the mark as the German unit slumped to a six-year low versus the U.S. dollar . 
the franc climbed as high as 3.3760 per mark from an early low of 3.3823 but slipped as low as 5.9883 against the dollar , its lowest level since February 1994 .
