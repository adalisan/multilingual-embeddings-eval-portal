Naphtha prices rose strongly on crude gains and good regional demand while gasoline only inched up ahead of Taiwan &apos;s tender which closes Tuesday , traders said on Monday . 
some traders were still bearish on Saudi Aramco &apos;s decision not to buy April gasoline and offered cargoes aggressively . 
&quot; The market has not changed overnight from tight to long , &quot; said one trader who preferred to look to Taiwan &apos;s tender to import reformate for second-half April . 
a Japanese trader who was an active buyer last week , purchased 150,000 barrels lifting April 1-15 from a European major and a Swiss trader - 92-octane at $ 28.25 per barrel , and 95-octane at $ 28.55 and $ 28.80 . 
on Friday , 95-octane was traded at $ 28.55- $ 28.75 . 
April naphtha swaps rose by 45 cents per barrel to $ 23.90 / $ 24.10 amid bullish sentiment , reflected by the strong awards in India &apos;s sell tender . 
state-owned Indian Oil Corp ( IOC ) sold 25,000 tonnes of low aromatic naphtha ( LAN ) lifting March 30-April 1 to European major Shell at $ 17.00 per tonne below Japanese spot quotes fob Vizag on the east coast , industry sources . 
the tender closed March 13 and was valid for a day . 
IOC &apos;s last Vizag LAN cargo was awarded at the end of January at a much lower discount of $ 30.00 per tonne fob for a 27,000 tonne cargo lifting February 9-11 . 
IOC issued two more sell tenders - 27,000 tonnes of high aromatic naphtha ( Han ) lifting March 27-29 from Madras on the east coast , and 30,000 tonnes of high aromatic naphtha ( Han ) lifting April 1-3 from Cochin on the west coast . 
both tenders close March 20 and is valid for a day .
