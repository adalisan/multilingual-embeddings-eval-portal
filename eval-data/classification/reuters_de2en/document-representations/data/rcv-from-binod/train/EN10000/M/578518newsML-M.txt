NWE gas oil prices held steady on Tuesday with barge and cargo premiums mostly stable , countering softer benchmark gas oil futures . 
traders said the spot market was very quiet with the recent price gains on June futures keeping buyers relaxed . 
milder weather was also seen dulling demand from the German inland . 
&quot; The sales volumes are very low , particularly after futures rose so much yesterday , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; The weather is spring like , the sun is shining and no-ones thinking about heating oil here , &quot; a trader for a German refiner said . 
heating oil barge prices sagged by about $ 1 in early trade in line with IPElosses but prices recovered as short-covering pulled futures off the lows and barge and cargo premiums held steady despite thin physical demand . 
offers were in the region of June IPE + $ 2 / + $ 2.50 fob Rotterdam , or + $ 1.50 fob Antwerp . 
buyers werre notionally pegged around screen flat to June + $ 1 a tonne . 
scant buying continued to pressure premiums for diesel cargoes . 
offers were heard around $ 1 per tonne lower at June IPE + $ 12 CIF Le Havre for EN590 . 
buying into Germany for Din spec was around June IPE + $ 4- $ 4.50 with offers around $ 1 higher .
