Russian financial markets advanced nervously on Tuesday as President Boris Yeltsin underwent heart surgery , but a successful outcome to the operation was built into prices , dealers said . 
Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said the seven-hour operation had ended successfully at 2 p.m. ( 1100 GMT ) . 
but markets will be watching to see how Yeltsin recuperates . 
the volatile Russian share market firmed on news early in the morning that the long-awaited operation had finally started , with prices of the most liquid stocks edging up a percentage point or so in early morning trade . 
prices continued to firm cautiously on the reports of the operation &apos;s success , but dealers said some brokers would start taking profits . 
dealers said the market was moving on speculation , also a factor in domestic treasury bills . 
Firuz Mansurkhodzhayev , stock department head at Creditanstalt-Grant , said brokers were pushing prices up in the hope of a speculative jump in prices on news of the operation &apos;s success . 
&quot; But I cannot yet see a queue of investors wishing to buy at these prices , &quot; he said . 
prices rose similarly before the July presidential election , after which shares dropped when Western investors failed to rush into the market . 
long-term domestic treasury bills firmed about one percent in thin morning trade , less than half normal levels at 2.6 trillion roubles turnover . 
some dealers speculated that six-month paper would firm when Yeltsin survived his operation . 
but Per Mellstrom , head of research at Brunswick in Moscow , predicted markets would not move much over the shortened trading week , which ends on Wednesday before a Russian holiday . 
&quot; There are very few people who expect the operation will not be successful . 
it &apos;s not like the election . 
most doctors say there is a 95 percent chance of success , and success is largely priced into most Russian markets . 
he said that if Yeltsin failed to survive , shares could plummet 20 to 30 percent , followed to a lesser degree by Ministry of Finance bonds , or MinFins , and treasury bills . 
Russian MinFin dollar bonds were up about two points , with the 2003 bonds quoted at 58.250 58.650 , up from 56.5 at Monday &apos;s London close . 
&quot; It is absolutely moving on the Yeltsin operation , &quot; said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell &apos;s Sergei Sidorov . 
&quot; The stolen bonds still could have a negative impact , but we could still see 60 again within the next week or week and a half . 
MinFins have been hit by a scandal involving stolen bonds , and the authorities have frozen about $ 74 million of bonds in the $ 11 billion market . 
the rouble paid little attention to the drama in the Cardiology Research Centre . 
&quot; The market is driven by concrete factors -- T-bill auctions , deposits , and so on , &quot; said MDM Bank dealer Nikolai Zolotarev . 
the rouble edged up on the Yeltsin news to 5,463-64 per dollar compared with an early 5,468-70 and 5,464-66 late on Monday . 
but fluctuations were moderate .
