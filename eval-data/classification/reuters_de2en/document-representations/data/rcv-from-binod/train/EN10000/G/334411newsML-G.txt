Albania &apos;s ruling right-wing Democrats on Monday switched the site of a counter-demonstration they had planned for Tuesday away from the opposition Socialist party headquarters to outside Tirana town hall . 
the Democrats announced their rally earlier on Monday , accusing the Socialists of encouraging the violent protests which have swept Albania in recent days over the collapse of high yielding pyramid schemes 
but in an apparent bid to avoid potential confrontation , the governing party said it wanted supporters to help clear up the damage caused by rioting on Sunday to the town hall . 
&quot; The Democratic party has decided to change the rally it announced for tomorrow into a constructive rally against violence and destruction by calling on its sympathisers in the capital to repare the damage caused to the Tirana town hall , &quot; Albanian state television said . 
the town hall is on the other side of Tirana &apos;s huge central Skanderbeg Square from the main offices of the Socialist party -- successor to the communist party which ruled Albania for 40 years until 1990 . 
windows in the town hall were smashed on Sunday after protesters fought with riot police in one of a number of bloody clashes seen throughout Albania . 
the wave of unrest was sparked by growing anger over the failure of the pyramid investment schemes into which Albanians have poured billions of leks ( millions of dollars ) in cash . 
Albanian President Sali Berisha , facing his biggest crisis since winning power in 1992 , called in the army on Sunday to restore order following the widespread violence . 
opposition parties have demanded that Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi &apos;s government resign over its handling of the pyramid scandals .
