the Bulgarian Lev closed at 1,565-1,570 per dollar in light interbank volume , a touch firmer from the morning &apos;s 1,565-1,575 due to low dollar demand , dealers said . 
&quot; Trade was thin today . 
the Lev gained some five from the morning as foreign currency demand waned , &quot; one dealer said . 
the Bulgarian National Bank ( BNB ) was seen as the main foreign currency buyer in the market today , purchasing dollars at 1,565-1,570 , dealers said . 
Central bank officials were not available for comment . 
the BNB has been seen as a net dollar buyer since the beginning of March , boosting its foreign exchange reserves and restraining a Lev rise amid high dollar supply .
