the commander of Russia &apos;s Mir space station said on Friday the situation had finally stabilised after an accident on Wednesday that severely reduced its electric power supply and holed one of its modules . 
&quot; For the first time , I feel that the situation on the station has stabilised , &quot; a spokeswoman at mission control near Moscow quoted Vasily Tsibliyev , 43 , as telling the centre after checking the air pressure , temperature and humidity . 
she also told reporters that Tsibliyev , his flight engineer Alexander Lazutkin , 39 , and 40-year-old British-born American physicist Michael Foale felt fine after a night &apos;s sleep . 
Mir keeps Moscow time as it hurtles round Earth . 
&quot; The crew feel all right , &quot; she said . 
but the cosmonauts now face a bleak two weeks waiting for an unmanned Progress freighter to deliver repair supplies and officials say the task of patching up the station will be tough . 
a committee including NASA officials and Mir &apos;s designer met early on Friday to try to work out a concrete plan of action to mend the damage and prepare for the launch of the cargo craft . 
a committee member said the main task was to place orders with different Russian firms to produce the necessary equipment . 
&quot; The work is very complicated , &quot; he said . 
among vital supplies , officials say special electric cable will be needed to fix the power supply . 
at least one of the cosmonauts will need to make a space walk to sort out the problem . 
no date is yet set for the launch of the supplies craft from Russia &apos;s Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan . 
the committee official said the ship , previously due to start a routine mission on Friday , could sit on the launch pad for 10 days . 
if it had to wait longer than that , it would need several more days for its fuel to be replaced and other checks . 
Wednesday &apos;s accident happened when an an unmanned Progress hit the 11-year-old Mir station during a training exercise and pierced a hole in its Spektr scientific module , which is now sealed off . 
the collision smashed one of Spektr &apos;s four solar panels and cut off power from the other three . 
this has cut electric power by 25 to 30 percent in the whole station and forced the crew to halt experiments and physical exercise to save energy . 
officials insist the crew are in no immediate danger but say they would abandon ship aboard a three-man Soyuz spacecraft currently docked at the station if the air pressure fell more than about a quarter below normal atmospheric pressure . 
Tsibliyev &apos;s wife Larisa told a Russian newspaper her husband &apos;s intensive survival training in extreme situations would pull him through the ordeal . 
and if that was not enough , he was carrying a plastic rabbit given to him by their daughter . 
&quot; It may not be pretty , but it always works , &quot; she said . 
officials at NASA , which has bankrolled much of Russia &apos;s Mir programme since the collapse of the Soviet Union in return for the use of the world &apos;s only orbital station , said the repairs would still be very tricky after the supply craft arrived . 
it &apos;s going to be interesting for the world to watch this . 
Russian Military Space Forces officials , who run the Progress programme , said it would be &quot; very tough &quot; to dock the unmanned craft due to Mir &apos;s loss of power , raising the prospect of the crew having to unload the supplies on a spacewalk . 
Foale , who has been on Mir since May , may have suffered most from the loss of the Spektr module . 
not only has he lost his computer equipment , he has also been separated from his sleeping area -- and his toothbrush . 
but Culbertson said : &quot; Mike sounds very positive and upbeat . 
he sees it as a quite interesting adventure at this point . 
the Russian space programme has come under fire from U.S. politicians concerned for the safety of NASA astronauts and about taxpayers &apos; dollars pumped into the Mir programme as a test-bed for the planned international space station , Alpha . 
Moscow and Washington have exchanged harsh words over delays in Russia &apos;s part of the project , due to be launched next year . 
Culbertson said it was too soon to consider the future of NASA &apos;s missions to Mir , saying an end to supply trips by the U.S. space shuttle would make it hard for it to keep going . 
if Mir were abandoned , recalling memories of the nearly disastrous ditching of the U.S. Apollo 13 in 1970 , the world &apos;s governments would face a 140-tonne headache . 
Mir could drift back toward Earth and , since it is far too big to burn up in the atmosphere , it could well fall on a built-up area .
