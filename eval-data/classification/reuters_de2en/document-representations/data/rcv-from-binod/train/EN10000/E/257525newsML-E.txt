businesses and consumers round the globe have an immediate reason to cheeer the results of the World Trade Organisation &apos;s inaugural ministerial conference . 
prices for a huge array of goods should fall following an agreement to scrap tariffs on computer chips and other information technology ( IT ) products , a market worth $ 600 billion a year and growing at an explosive pace . 
but the weeklong meeting may also be remembered as the conference that sowed the seeds of an important new round of negotiations to free up global trade in the 21st century . 
&quot; Round or no round , the process of liberalisation after the negotiations today will go on very expeditiously , &quot; an ebullient Renato Ruggiero , the director-general of the WTO , said on Friday as the conference closed . 
Ruggiero , 66 , had reason to be pleased . 
the reputation of global summits had been on the slide . 
recent international conferences on development , the family and food security among others had been criticised as little more than talking shops . 
so when ministers from 128 member states of a body that operates by consensus gathered to shape an agenda for the turn of the century , expectations were understandably modest . 
but by the end of the week Ruggiero was savouring a deal to remove tariffs on IT that should give a powerful boost to the fastest-growing sector of the world economy and build voters &apos; support for free trade by making everyday goods cheaper . 
he also skilfully steered the meeting , after long nights of haggling , to compromises over the work the Geneva-based WTO will begin on links between trade , investment , competition and government procurement . 
with some governments hoping the preparatory studies will lead to global rules to protect foreign investors and halt anti-competitive practices that skew trade , the talks could lead eventually to a vast extension of the WTO &apos;s reach . 
from the outside , nitpicking over nuances in a ministerial statement might seem hard to comprehend . 
but if the arguments were fierce , especially over whether to delve into the link between trade and labour standards , it was because ministers knew the longer-term stakes were high . 
&quot; History has shown that generalised words should not be dismissed as waffle but rather regarded as the first foundation and building block for agreements , &quot; European Union Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan told reporters . 
a new cycle of talks over farm products and services is due to begin in 1999 in any case as part of the follow-up to the 1986-1993 Uruguay Round of trade negotiations . 
the talks on agriculture , which excites political , economic and cultural passions like no other sector , are sure to be arduous . 
some governments will insist on parallel negotiations in other areas to increase the opportunties for horse trading , which is what happened in the drawn-out Uruguay Round . 
Ruggiero acknowledged that the prospect of another full-blown round so soon stirs uneasiness in many capitals . 
but he said the speed with which major trading countries were able to thrash out an IT deal showed this need not be an insuperable obstacle to further trade liberalisation . 
&quot; Things are changing , and they are changing fast . 
before , there was the idea that no sectoral agreement could be reached if there was not a Round . 
and yet now we have reached an important agreement on IT in just a few months , &quot; he said . 
his conclusion ? 
&quot; When we are trading into the future , we are very fast . 
it is only when we begin to talk about textiles and agriculture -- the traditional sectors -- that negotiations are very difficult .
