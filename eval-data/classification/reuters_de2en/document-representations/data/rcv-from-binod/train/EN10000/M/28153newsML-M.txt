the Hong Kong futures Exchange ( HKFE ) said on Monday it would launch a rolling sterling contract on September 20 . 
it will be the third rolling forex contract to be introduced following the launch of its Deutschemark and yen contracts last November , it said . 
&quot; With a steady growth in volume of the rolling forex contracts over the last ten months , we feel we are ready to expand the product to meet the demand of the market , &quot; said HKFE chairman Frank Wong . 
&quot; Sterling was chosen as the third currency to be introduced , reflecting the preference of HKFE members , expressed through a recent market survey , &quot; he said . 
the size of each contract is 50,000 stg and the minimum fluctuation is 0.0001 with a tick value of US $ 5 , it said , adding that trading hours and procedures were the same as other rolling forex contracts .
