hopes were low in the Belgian money market on Monday that the National Bank of Belgium ( NBB ) was about to rescue it from surging short-term rates . 
the central bank allots liquidity to the market each day through repurchase agreements . 
each Monday it also holds a seven day money tender NBVA ; last week it gave the market around 10 billion Belgian francs in this way , down from 15 a week earlier . 
dealers expected little change in policy on Monday , noting the NBB had kept liquidity tight since the Belgian franc began sliding against the mark earlier this year . 
the franc was at 20.6485 / 00 to the mark at 0930 GMT vs 20.6450 / 70 late on Friday . 
one money trader Siad the rise in short term rates , which has taken one-week repos to 4.05 / 15 percent from 3.32 / 34 in under three weeks and pushed up three-month T-bills to more than 3.60 percent from 3.30 percent , had caught everyone by surprise . 
it was also sparking animosity between players , he said . 
one rumour had it that a few domestic banks had deliberately sucked out liquidity from the market to spite an NBB move three weeks ago to place an order for mark / Belge through a New York-based investment bank . 
&quot; One bank accuses another , &quot; the trader said . 
a central bank spokesman declined to comment on the rumour , which could not be confirmed by other market sources . 
one analyst noted the Dutch guilder and Dutch money market rates had also come under pressure recently . 
this would indicate that the explosion in Belgian rates was not an isolated story . 
&quot; It could be some anticipation of higher rates in Europe , &quot; he said . 
one OLO trader said the rise in short rates , which has pushed up rates on the front end of the OLO curve , could drain interest from Monday &apos;s regular OLO auction , where OLOs 14 ( 7.25 PCT , 2004 ) and 26 ( 6.25 PCT , 2007 ) are on offer . 
however , with OLOs 11 and 16 paying coupons this week there would be some cash in the market for reinvesting .
