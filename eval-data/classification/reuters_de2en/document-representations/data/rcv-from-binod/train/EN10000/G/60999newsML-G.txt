the Croatian National Security Council stepped up pressure on Wednesday for the return of a rebel Serb enclave , saying there was no reason why elections should not be held there in December . 
Croatian state radio said the council , chaired by President Franjo Tudjman , believed there were no obstacles to holding elections in Eastern Slavonia on December 15 and all conditions would be met on time . 
Eastern Slavonia , which lies on Croatia &apos;s border with Serbia , is the last area still under rebel Serb control following a war when Zagreb declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 . 
Eastern Slavonia is due to return to Zagreb &apos;s control next year after a transitional period under a United Nations administration . 
Croatian forces regained two other rebel Serb-held enclaves in 1995 by force . 
elections are a key part of the territory &apos;s transition process . 
the date of December 15 is one month before the mandate of the U.N. 
Tudjman said in August that he was willing to extend the mandate only by three months . 
but the government has also said that he plans to undertake a symbolic trip to the main town in the enclave , Vukovar , in April next year to raise the Croatian flag and declare Croatia free of rebels . 
according to state television , the Security Council insisted that only people registered as living in the area in a 1991 census be allowed to vote . 
Serb authorities in Eastern Slavonia are likely to resist the condition , because it rules out thousands of Serb refugees from other parts of Croatia from participating in the vote .
