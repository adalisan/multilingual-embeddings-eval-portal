IPE Brent crude futures closed firmer but off the session high on Tuesday after a day of short-covering ahead of weekly U.S. stocks figures due after the close of the trade . 
August Brent ended up 22 cents at $ 18.06 a barrel , having drifted off the intra-day high of $ 18.32 . 
earlier , July gas oil closed $ 2.00 higher at $ 163.75 a tonne , having failed to breach resistance at $ 164.50 . 
&quot; People are expecting a large draw down on U.S. crude , &quot; said one broker . 
&quot; If so , we should see even more of a recovery tomorrow . 
U.S. traders were expecting American Petroleum Institute ( API ) weekly inventory data to show a two to three million barrel draw in crude stocks . 
nevertheless , despite healthy gasoline demand , a gasoline stock build of one to two million barrels was also expected . 
strong technicals helped to push the market up early with stops triggered as Brent climbed above $ 18.10 . 
&quot; It &apos;s basically been a day of short-covering , but there is a lid on the upside , &quot; a dealer said . 
brokers said that the large investment funds which got their fingers burnt during recent market falls were keen not to miss out on the rally . 
background fundamental strength was drawn from continued uncertainty over when Iraq will resume exports under the second term of the oil-for-food programme . 
some pessimists in the market were not expecting first oil until August . 
traders said that North Sea loading programmes for July were broadly in line with expectations . 
loadings are up 190,000 barrels per day from June , mostly due to the completion of maintenance programmes .
