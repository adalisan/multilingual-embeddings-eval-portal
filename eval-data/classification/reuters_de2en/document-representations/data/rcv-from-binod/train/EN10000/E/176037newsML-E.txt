the Mexican government will use the proceeds from its newly placed 500 billion lira floating-rate note issue to replace debt coming due this year and next , a senior government official said on Thursday . 
the lira note , worth about $ 325 million , was well received in European markets on Thursday , the official said . 
Mexico has a $ 1.5 billion one-year note coming due this month that pays a rate based either on Mexican treasury bills ( Cetes ) or on Libor . 
&quot; Basically we have covered all the Cetes-Libor note , and for next year we have a light schedule , &quot; the government official , who declined to be identified , said . 
&quot; I think we can include those amortizations as short-term obligations , &quot; he said . 
in August , the federal government placed a mark-denominated bond worth about $ 675 million . 
in September , it issued a 70 billion yen bond , worth about $ 640 million . 
those bonds were placed to help cover the maturing dual-rate note . 
in October , the federal government reopened the mark bond and added another 500 million marks . 
for next year , the government has $ 1.413 billion in maturing bonds coming due , according to the 1997 federal budget released . 
&quot; We are very pleased with this issue . 
we have found very strong demand in Italy and also in Switzerland , &quot; the official said . 
&quot; I think the proof is that we achieved very attractive terms and conditions . 
that is equal to a dollar rate of 249 basis points above U.S. treasuries , the Finance Ministry said in a statement . 
lead managers were Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and J.P. Morgan Securities . 
a group of financial institutions in the lira market also participated . 
while several Latin American borrowers have placed lira issues this year -- Mexico &apos;s Petroleos Mexicanos , Argentina sovereigns and Brazil &apos;s Telebras -- this is the first floating rate note from an emerging market borrower in the lira market . 
the issue is part of Mexico &apos;s strategy to create new benchmarks in several European currencies as the government broadens the base of currencies in which it borrows . 
government officials say the country could tap other European markets again for relatively small amounts . 
&quot; We are always looking at these alternatives . 
they are part of our strategy for next year , &quot; the official said . 
since returning to international capital markets in mid-1995 after the peso crash , Mexico has placed its issues in U.S. dollars , marks and yen . 
&quot; It is important to note that with this operation , Mexico widens the base of international investors in Mexican instruments , &quot; the Finance Ministry said about the lira issue .
