Singapore gas oil swaps fell late afternoon on in active trade as sellers came out in force on fears of a price crash in the face of the prompt physical overhang , traders said . 
&quot; The physical over hang is starting to take its toll . 
people think this market is going to be thrashed , &quot; one trader said . 
July paper was last quoted at $ 22.80 / $ 22.90 , down sharply from Friday &apos;s range of $ 23.15 / $ 23.25 . 
the market was actively traded with about 500,000 barrels exchanging hands at between $ 23.05 to $ 22.85 per barrel , brokers said . 
traders said the market was worried about the rising middle distillate stock level in Singapore , which has forced some refiners to store product outside their refinery system on a spot basis . 
latest data from the Trade Development Board showed middle distillate stocks in the week ending June 11 rose 993,000 barrels to 11.236 million barrels , the highest since at least January 1994 . 
last week , one refiner sold a prompt spot 30,000-tonne cargo at a 40-cent discount to spot Singapore quotes on a free-on-board basis due to tight ullage , compared to the prevailing 10 cents discount . 
traders said news of Shell Singapore &apos;s near seven percent cut in refining output at its 430,000 barrel per day refinery will have minimal impact due to the large unsold prompt cargoes . 
the market might see support from arbitrage players looking to cash out their profits if paper prices fall low enough for them to buy back their positions , traders said . 
traders said physical sellers were expected to emerge at low levels later Monday at prices at or even below the key support level of $ 23.00 per barrel . 
on Tuesday , physical gas oil traded at a low of $ 22.80 per barrel but it has recovered since to above $ 23.00 on expectations of fresh buying from the region . 
but sentiment has turned bearish because little fresh demand has emerged from the big buyers such as China and Indonesia . 
fuel oil swaps edged up slightly with July last quoted at $ 105.00 / $ 101.00 , from Friday &apos;s $ 99.75 / $ 100.50 , brokers said .
