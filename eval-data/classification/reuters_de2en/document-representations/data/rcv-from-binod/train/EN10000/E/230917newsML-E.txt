the Argentine province of Cordoba , boasting the country &apos;s second-largest economy , expects its gross domestic product to grow 3.5 percent this year and 5.5 percent in 1997 , its governor said . 
Ramon Mestre , speaking to reporters at a working breakfast here , also projected the province &apos;s jobless rate , now at 15 percent , would remain stubbornly high , declining by just two percentage points by the middle of next year . 
&quot; Jobs are not growing at the same rate as production , &quot; Mestre said . 
&quot; Because of modern technology , many jobs that were lost are not being compensated for by new jobs . 
Cordoba , the hub of Argentina &apos;s auto industry , accounts for 10 percent of Argentine exports and boasts a GDP of some $ 25 billion and better growth and jobs forecasts than the nation as a whole . 
by comparison , Argentina , with a $ 278 billion economy and 17.1 percent unemployment , is expected to post GDP growth of between three and five percent in 1997 . 
Mestre , who is in Sao Paulo at the head of a 45-person business delegation , said Cordoba is pinning hopes for greater jobs growth and a higher standard of living on further integration of the four-nation Mercosur customs union . 
that is not surprising , as nearly 60 percent of the province &apos;s $ 2.15 billion in annual exports go to Brazil , while 45 percent of its annual imports come from Brazil . 
Mercosur is comprised of Argentina , Brazil , Paraguay and Uruguay with Chile as an associate member . 
much of the trade between Cordoba and Brazil , the giant in Mercosur , is in auto parts . 
but Cordoba officials say the province &apos;s tourism and agroindustrial sectors are poised for strong growth next year . 
Jose Porta , the province &apos;s production and Labor minister , said Swiss-owned Nestle has begun a $ 50 million expansion at its Villa Maria plant to double powdered milk output . 
the project is among some $ 250 million in projected new investments in the province &apos;s milk , cheese and chocolate industry , he said . 
porta also said Bolivia &apos;s expected association later this month with Mercosur also will serve as a boost to Cordoba , which currently exports $ 40 million to the Andean nation and imports wood , machinery and natural gas . 
despite snags in Mercosur on such products as automobiles and potatoes , Mestre and Porta expressed confidence such problems would be increasingly easy to resolve as the bloc continues integrating .
