Albanian rebels reacted coolly on Sunday to an agreement between President Sali Berisha and leaders of all political parties to form a national unity government and hold elections by June . 
&quot; We are pleased with the statement . 
we are in touch with ( rebels in ) Sarande , Vlore and Delvine to decide what to do . 
but at this point our position remains that Berisha must quit before we surrender our weapons , &quot; said ex-general Agim Gozhita , who was elected earlier to head Gjirokaster &apos;s rebel council . 
Berisha reached the deal to try to an end to a rebellion which has swept through Albania &apos;s southern region . 
Gjirokaster , close to the Greek border , fell to the rebels on Saturday along with a major army base nearby . 
it was the latest in a string of towns and villages to go over to the rebel cause and a major blow to Berisha . 
the well-armed rebels now control the Adriatic coast from Vlore to Sarande as well as a large swathe of the interior . 
&quot; From what we &apos;ve heard so far , we won &apos;t give our weapons back . 
we want him ( Berisha ) to resign , &quot; said the number two in the Gjirokaster rebel council , Sotirakis Manthos . 
a third council member , Murat Kaci of the opposition Socialist Party , said : &quot; Berisha has a very bad record of keeping his word and we don &apos;t believe him . 
we &apos;ll decide what to do when it &apos;s proven that what he says is true . 
but in Tirana , Albanian state television quoted the official ATA news agency as saying that initial reaction to the deal was enthusiastic in Gjirokaster and the rebel-held Adriatic port of Vlore to the west . 
Kaci said the Socialists , the heirs to the Stalinists who ruled Albania with an iron fist for 45 years , also wanted the immediate release from prison of leader Fatos Nano . 
Nano was jailed on corruption charges but the Socialists said his conviction was politically inspired . 
Kaci also said two months was too little time to organise for the election , especially under the state of emergency imposed last week to deal with the southern rebellion . 
Berisha &apos;s right-wing Democratic Party won general elections last year , taking almost every seat in the 140-seat parliament . 
but opposition parties and Western observers alike described the election as fraudulent . 
Berisha , an ex-communist and heart surgeon , was elected to a new five-year term by parliament this month . 
under the constitution , it would be possible for the opposition to win an election and for Berisha to stay on as president . 
but Berisha said last week that he would step down &quot; within four days &quot; if his Democratic Party lost any new election . 
rebels in the south remained deeply suspicious that he was manoeuvring to buy time , to seek a way to stay in power and to prepare the army for an assault on rebel towns . 
&quot; He will try to rig the elections again , that &apos;s all he &apos;s trying to do , &quot; said Kaci .
