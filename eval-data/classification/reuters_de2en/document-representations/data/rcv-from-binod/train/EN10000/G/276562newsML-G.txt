Serbia &apos;s Zajedno opposition said on Thursday it feared the socialist government was preparing to arrest its leaders to end weeks of demonstrations in Belgrade against President Slobodan Milosevic . 
a Zajedno spokeswoman said 20,000 riot police equipped with water cannon were deployed in the capital to prevent a 37th day of opposition protests against socialist election-rigging . 
the interior ministry warned on Wednesday that police would no longer tolerate disruption of traffic in Belgrade by daily opposition and student marches . 
the spokeswoman said it was feared the three main Zajedno leaders , Zoran Djindjic , Vuk Draskovic and Vesna Pesic , might be detained . 
police made no attempt to interfere with a student march on Wednesday but eyewitnesses said strong forces of police were massed around the Zajedno rallying point in the city centre . 
the police movements themselves caused traffic chaos and blocked river and motorway bridges on which the city relies .
