a senior Iranian cleric on Friday accused Afghanistan &apos;s radical Islamic Taleban movement of giving Islam a bad name by imposing &quot; fossilised &quot; policies and committing acts of violence . 
the fundamentalist Taleban , which captured the Afghan capital Kabul a week ago , have taken control of about two-thirds of the war-torn country , imposing a strict Islamic code . 
&quot; Through their fossilised policies , they ( Taleban ) stop girls from attending school , stop women from working out of homes and all that in the name of Islam , &quot; Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati told worshippers at Tehran University . 
&quot; What could be worse than committing violence , narrow- mindedness and limiting women &apos;s rights ( thereby ) defaming Islam ? 
&quot; Jannati asked . 
Jannati , whose sermon was carried live on Tehran radio , is secretary of the conservative 12-member Guardian Council which has veto power over parliament . 
after their black-bearded warriors swept into Kabul in a virtually bloodless takeover , Taleban leaders are gearing up to take Afghanistan into a new era guided by their purist interpretation of Islamic Sharia law . 
Shi &apos;ite Iran has supported the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani and was hostile to the Sunni fundamentalist Taleban . 
Iran &apos;s media has accused the Taleban of being manipulated by Pakistan and the United States . 
Pakistan denies charges from Afghanistan &apos;s ousted government that Islamabad gave military help to the Taleban . 
in his sermon , Jannati called on Pakistan to condemn the actions of the Taleban to prove it did not support the group . 
&quot; If Pakistan is not interfering , it should condemn the Taleban , who have done nothing but kill and commit violent acts since they emerged , &quot; the cleric said . 
Iran &apos;s Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said on Friday Iran advocated peace and stability in neighbouring Afghanistan without preference to any specific rival group in the country , the Iranian news agency IRNA said . 
Velayati repeated a call on the rival groupings to lay down their arms and work together to promote peace and stability in Afghanistan .
