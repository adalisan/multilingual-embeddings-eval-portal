the peseta held steady against the mark in afternoon trade on Monday supported by a firm dollar but trade remained light with little to grab dealers &apos; attention , traders said . 
by 1630 GMT , the peseta was trading at 84.16 / 18 per mark , compared with levels seen late on Friday of 84.30 / 32 . 
&quot; The peseta / mark has scarcely moved this afternoon , it appears that the market is still tired after the strong correction last week , &quot; said one trader . 
traders said comments from Spanish Budget Secretary Jose Folgado did little to move the Spanish currency . 
Folgado told Reuters he was convinced Spain would meet its target of reducing the ratio of budget deficit to gross domestic product to three percent in 1997 . 
he added , however , that he would have preferred that the peseta had not appreciated so much . 
against the dollar , the peseta was trading at 138.08 / 13 compared with late Friday levels of 137.20 / 25 .
