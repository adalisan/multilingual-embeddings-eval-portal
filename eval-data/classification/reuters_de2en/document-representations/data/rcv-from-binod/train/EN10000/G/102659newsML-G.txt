the Anglican church is reviewing its role during the 1994 massacres in Rwanda in light of accusations of complicity in the killings , the head of the church , the Archbishop of Canterbury , has said . 
a &quot; party of senior legal people &quot; has been sent to Rwanda to &quot; look at church history during that very troubled period , &quot; Archbishop George Carey said , in a recording obtained on Tuesday of a conversation with local and religous reporters on Sunday . 
&quot; There were Anglican and Catholic and other church leaders who have been accused of complicity in the genocide , &quot; he said . 
Carey was spoke with reporters during a meeting of Episcopal and Lutheran bishops in White Haven , Pennsylvania . 
the meeting ended on Tuesday . 
he declined to discuss any findings of the investigators or what form the alleged complicity may have taken . 
&quot; We are closely involved with the situation there and we are very concerned about it , &quot; he said . 
up to one million Tutsi tribal members and Hutu moderates were killed in 1994 in a spasm of violence by Hutu troops , militias and mobs . 
last year , in a speech at the United Nations , Carey said Anglicans in Rwanda had failed to provide a &quot; shining example . 
&quot; Despite many individual acts of heroism and prophetic witnesses , it seems the leadership was in some way compromised and discredited , &quot; Carey said in the September , 1995 speech . 
Carey said on Sunday the church was now &quot; functioning very well , &quot; in Rwanda , although there remained three bishops who had left the country and were unable to return out of fear for being jailed . 
although Anglican and Roman Catholic bishops , priests and nuns were among those killed , the churches also have faced accusations from witnesses that some priests and nuns engaged or cooperated in the killings .
