a Malaysian high court on Saturday acquitted two Turks of a charge of murdering a former member of the Canadian Air Force , the national Bernama news agency reported . 
justice Pajan Singh Gill directed a seven-member jury to return a verdict of not gulity on Olmez Orhan and Kocaslan Hidayet without their defence being called . 
Orhan , 40 , and Hidayet , 28 , were jointly charged with the murder of John Gatley , 68 , in central Cameron Highlands between February 10 and 11 , 1994 . 
&quot; The prosecution has no doubt proved that Gatley was murdered but has not linked the two to the death of the deceased , &quot; Gill said . 
&quot; suspicion however strong cannot be substituted as direct evidence and is insufficient to prove that they caused the death of Gatley , &quot; he said .
