more than 300 leading southern African industrialists met in Harare on Monday to discuss strategies to develop Mozambique &apos;s Beira Corridor as a launchpad for investment and economic growth for the region . 
organisers of the two-day conference said the Beira Corridor , one of landlocked southern African countries &apos; main gateways to overseas markets , had strong basic infrastructure which could be used to stimulate economic development . 
&quot; We realise that we have a very strong base in the infrastructure that we have in the Beira Corridor which we can use to stimulate economic growth in the region , &quot; said David Zausmer , managing director of the Beira Corridor Group . 
the group was formed in the early 1980s by southern African states to coordinate the rehabilitation of the Beira Corridor , -- ravaged by Mozambique &apos;s 16 years of civil war -- and to lessen their dependence on then apartheid South Africa &apos;s ports . 
the corridor serves Botswana , Malawi , Mozambique , Zaire and Zimbabwe . 
Zausmer said the conference hopes to forge a partnership among these countries to implement commercially viable and productive investment projects . 
opening the conference , which was also attended by some potential international investors , Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said development of the Beira Corridor was a practical step towards speeding up integration of the region &apos;s economies . 
&quot; Development corridors are important both as gateways for landlocked countries and also as areas with potential for rapid economic growth and market integration , &quot; he said . 
but he said development of the Beira Corridor would have to be spurred by the region &apos;s private sector , noting that most southern African governments faced perennial budgetary constraints and dwindling international donor aid . 
&quot; Private investment will play a great role in stimulating economic growth and trade , while governments themselves will play more of a facilitating role , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It will , therefore , be necessary for both parties to identify constraints that are likely to hinder private sector investment ... in the development corridor , &quot; he added . 
Mugabe said Zimbabwe and Mozambique had set up a joint working group of technical experts and business representatives to advise the two governments on how to promote and develop the corridor . 
he said projects identified for the corridor included the construction of a 500 megawatt gas-powered electricty generation plant . 
a Z $ 6 billion ( U.S. $ 558 million ) iron ore project planned by South African , American , Zimbabwean and Mozambican investors was also one of the major ventures being discussed . 
Zausmer said the conference on the Beira Corridor was also prompted by the region &apos;s economic powerhouse , South Africa , which earlier this year unveiled plans to develop a corridor linking its northern region with Mozambique &apos;s Maputo port on this Indian Ocean .
