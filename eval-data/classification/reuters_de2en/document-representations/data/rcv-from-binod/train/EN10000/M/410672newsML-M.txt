U.S. municipal bonds mainly were unchanged in quiet , midday trade Friday , still digesting big losses suffered after the Federal Reserve Chairman warned he would act pre-emptively to restrain inflation . 
traders said prices appeared to have stabilized--for now--though remarks by Alan Greenspan , chairman of the U.S. central bank , on Wednesday have been interpreted as putting the market on notice that monetary policy might be tightened as soon as the March 25 meeting of the Federal Reserve &apos;s policy-making arm . 
whether issuers would continue to shy away from the market remained a matter of debate after several issues were pulled as bond prices deteriorated at mid-week . 
&quot; There &apos;s still a lot of supply coming , I don &apos;t know if it all was postponned , &quot; one said . 
while the calender for next week only totals about $ 2.8 billion , down from this week &apos;s approximately $ 3.4 billion , the latest level was $ 900 million higher than a preliminary estimate released late Thursday by the Reuters Municipal Bond Information Group . 
still , in recent weeks the total of new offerings has fallen from an early blip this year , and the overall lack of attractive new bonds has helped support prices . 
negotiated offerings for next week were expected to total $ 2.1 billion in 33 sales , with a $ 300 million Jefferson County , Ala . , issue through Raymond James topping the list . 
on the competitive side , 40 sales totaling $ 746 million are on the schedule . 
traders also looked ahead to two large offerings by the New York dormitory Authority , which plans to sell $ 250 million of revenue bonds in a syndicate led by Bear Stearns , and $ 230 million of revenue bonds in a team led by Smith Barney . 
U.S. March Treasury bond futures on the Chicago Board of Trade rose five ticks to 110-29 / 32 , while the March municipal bond futures climbed eight ticks to 116-2 / 32 . 
in the secondary market , actively quoted issues included Florida Ports Financing Commission revenues of June 2027 , which pay 5-3 / 8 percent coupon , and were bid at 5.81 percent , net , up one basis point . 
and Jefferson County , Alabama sewer revenues of February 2027 , which have a 5-3 / 8 percent coupon , were bid at 5.72 percent , net , down two basis points .
