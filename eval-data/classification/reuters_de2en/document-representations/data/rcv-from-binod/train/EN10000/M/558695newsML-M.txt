despite record volume growth , the U.S. options industry is lagging behind the growth of equity trading and must act soon to get more investors to use options or risk stagnating , Alger Chapman , former chairman of the Chicago Board Options Exchange ( CBOE ) , said Friday . 
&quot; The options business has not kept up with the explosion of NYSE ( New York Stock Exchange ) and Nasdaq volume over the past five years , &quot; he told industry members gathered here for the 15th annual options industry conference . 
&quot; We &apos;ve got a tremendous opportunity to play catch-up , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There are some things that must be done to capitalize on the dramatic increase in value and volume of the underlying equity market . 
to battle this problem , the industry must bring down the cost of options to both investors and the firms that are distribution channels for options , increase marketing efforts , increase options training for new brokers and redouble its efforts to influence regulation in Washington , Chapman said . 
Chapman retired from the CBOE in March after serving as chairman and chief executive officer since October 1986 .
