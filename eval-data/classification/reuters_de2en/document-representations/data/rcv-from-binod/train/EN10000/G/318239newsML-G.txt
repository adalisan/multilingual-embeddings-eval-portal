a little-known Slovakian teenager gave world number one Pete Sampras the fright of his life at the Australian Open on Monday , taking him to five sets in a fourth-round cliffhanger . 
Dominik Hrbaty , a 19-year-old ranked 76 in the world , ignored searing heat to produce some of the most exciting tennis of the tournament before Sampras reasserted himself to win 6-7 6-3 6-4 3-6 6-4 in two hours and 53 minutes . 
&quot; There &apos;s an old saying , it &apos;s better to be lucky than good and I definitely had a lot more luck than good today , &quot; Sampras told reporters after the match . 
Sampras &apos;s near-defeat followed a day of surprises on Sunday when temperatures of around 50 degrees Celsius ( 122 Fahrenheit ) on court saw three top women seeds , including world number one Steffi Graf , bundled out of the tournament . 
the women &apos;s upsets continued on Monday , with unseeded Belgian Dominique van roost ousting 15th seed Chanda Rubin of the United States in straight sets , 7-5 6-4 . 
but number 14 seed Mary Joe Fernandez of the United States managed to dispose of unseeded Swiss Patty Schnyder 4-6 6-4 6-1 . 
third seed Goran Ivanisevic also faced a heart-thumping five-setter on Monday to advance to the quarter-finals , fighting back from two sets to one down to beat unseeded Norwegian Christian Ruud 4-6 6-2 6-7 6-3 6-3 . 
temperatures on Monday were even higher than at the weekend . 
&quot; It was unbelievable I &apos;ve never played in such conditions before , &quot; Ivanisevic said . 
Ivanisevic now meets either 11th seed Jim courier or fifth seed Thomas muster , while Sampras will face the winner of Monday &apos;s fourth-round match between 10th seed Albert Costa and eighth seed Wayne Ferreira . 
in the women &apos;s draw , there was more heartbreak for Slovakia . 
ninth seed Karina Habsudova lost the chance of a quarter-final berth against Martina Hingis when she was beaten 6-4 6-4 by Romanian eighth seed Irina Spirlea . 
after storming to victory on Saturday night , Sampras told reporters he would not even recognise Hrbaty if he bumped into him in the locker room -- although Hrbaty said he had asked Sampras for his autograph at the French Open three years ago . 
after Monday &apos;s match , in which the teenager pushed Sampras around the court with long forehands and used a deep and powerful serve to whip up 20 aces , the Florida-based number one is unlikely ever to forget him . 
&quot; I think he &apos;s going to be a player to be reckoned with in coming years . 
the Slovakian is the youngest man in the top 100 and jumped 287 places in 1996 in the fastest rise of any player . 
he turned professional last year and has so far earned US $ 71,000 compared to more than $ 25 million earned by Sampras . 
down 2-4 in the deciding set , Sampras looked to be in a daze , sapped of energy and heading for an upset loss rivalling his third-round exit at last year &apos;s Australian Open . 
his tactic of conserving energy , waiting for the grand slam debutant to make mistakes , seemed at best risky as the teenager set pulses racing , earning a break point and a chance to serve for the match at 5-2 . 
Sampras saved the break point and , having closed out the game with an ace , his strategy finally began to pay off . 
Hrbaty double-faulted in the next game to allow Sampras to even the score at 4-4 and then squandered another break point in the ninth game to lose his momentum entirely . 
Sampras then shattered the Slovakian &apos;s dream of a grand slam quarter final berth , breaking him in world number one style with a forehand winner down the line . 
world number four Ivanisevic hammered 38 aces as he came back against 56th-ranked Ruud . 
the volatile Croat once again displayed his fiery temper , throwing his racquet to the ground as the Norwegian built up a two sets to one lead . 
but where the top women failed on Sunday , the top men scraped through . 
Ivanisevic knelt down to celebrate his victory but leapt straight back up again .
