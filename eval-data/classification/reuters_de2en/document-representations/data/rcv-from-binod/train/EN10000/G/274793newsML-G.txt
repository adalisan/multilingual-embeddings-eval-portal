rebels holding 140 hostages at the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence in Lima will never surrender in their standoff with the Peruvian government , a man claiming to be their international spokesman said on Monday . 
&quot; effectively , what the government of President ( Alberto ) Fujimori is asking is that the group ... gives up , &quot; Isaac Velazco said in a television interview with Cable News Network from Hamburg , Germany . 
&quot; The word surrender or capitulation is not in the vocabulary of the Tupac Amaru ( Revolutionary Movement / MRTA ) soldier , &quot; he said . 
earlier on Monday a woman claiming to be Velazco &apos;s wife , Norma Velazco , called a Paraguayan radio station from Hamburg claiming the MRTA was planning more attacks . 
&quot; If the Peruvian government insists on not allowing a political solution or if it insists on a military solution ... it is possible that there will be actions to put pressure ... on military targets &quot; , the woman said . 
&quot; The commandos and the columns are prepared for new actions of pressure at any moment ... 
it is now up to Mr. Fujimori &quot; , she added . 
her husband called Fujimori &quot; a dictator . 
there was no sign of a breakthrough in the siege , now in its seventh day . 
the rebels have released about 360 hostages , but have stuck to their main demand that the government release all their jailed comrades -- a demand Fujimori has flatly rejected . 
the president has said he wants to preserve lives , but told the rebels on Saturday night the only way for them to avoid bloodshed was to surrender and release all their captives . 
police sources told Reuters on Monday they believed MRTA rebels were ready to attack other targets in Peru if dialogue in the crisis breaks down . 
&quot; There are indications that show it &apos;s possible the MRTA will carry out sabotage actions against embassies , state bodies and government representatives , &quot; one anti-terrorist police source said . 
Peru &apos;s anti-terrorist police DINCOTE have carefully studied a video showing MRTA leader Nestor Cerpa Cartolini training comrades for the Japanese Embassy attack and they now believe the rebels have organised another group that is operating outside the residence somewhere in Lima , one source said . 
&quot; If ( police ) storm the embassy it is possible they will start car bomb attacks or other sabotage . 
it gives the impression that the MRTA is playing its last card , &quot; the source said . 
the video showed rebels standing around a scale model of the embassy residence practicing the attack using the same fake ambulance that was employed in last Tuesday &apos;s storming . 
it was sent anonymously to a local television station and broadcast last week . 
political analysts say the storming of the residence appeared to be a last-ditch attempt by Cerpa -- the only top MRTA leader not in jail -- to save the group from oblivion after mass arrests decimated its ranks over the past few years . 
police said a Peruvian crack commando team was standing by to storm the residence as a last resort if talks failed .
