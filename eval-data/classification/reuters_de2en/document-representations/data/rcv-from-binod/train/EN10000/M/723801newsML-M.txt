contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mixed on Friday with short-term contracts rising , boosted by one new domestic A share issue on the Shenzhen stock exchange , traders said . 
the annual rate for the most actively traded seven-day contract rose to 8.81 percent from 8.30 percent on Thursday . 
total turnover of the six-contract market rose slightly to 1.9 million losts from 1.8 million lots . 
one lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills . 
Shijiazhuang Lian Hua Co , one of China &apos;s major chemical petroleum producers , issued a heavy 120 million A shares on Friday on the Shenzhen bourse . 
&quot; The heavy volume of the new issue boosted short-term fund demand on the repo market , supporting the seven-day and 14-day contracts in particular , &quot; a trader said . 
traders said the rise on the domestic A share markets was another positive factor supporting the short-term rates . 
&quot; Financial institutions including securities houses traded the early-maturing contracts actively today due to the stock market rise , &quot; a second trader said . 
but the late-maturing contract fell a little due to shrinking fund demand ahead of the weekend , traders said . 
traders said they expected the rates to rise a little next Monday due to another new A share issue in Shenzhen . 
contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended up cross the board on Friday led by the market &apos;s two longest-term debt contracts , traders said . 
the most actively traded seven-year note that matures in August 2003 rose sharply to 98.00 yuan from 96.95 yuan . 
combined volume of the eight-contract market rose slightly to 1.14 million lots from 1.09 million lots . 
the seven-year note and the 10-year note rose sharply due to their high yields of around 11 percent and because their interests were paid annually instead of on maturity , adding to their liquidity , traders said . 
market sentiment had improved after the rise of the two late-maturing contracts on Friday and the spot contracts were likely to continue to rise early next week , traders said .
