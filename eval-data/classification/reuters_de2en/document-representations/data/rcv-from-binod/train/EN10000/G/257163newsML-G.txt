the Palestine Liberation Organisation called on the Security Council on Friday to prevent Israel from carrying out plans to build 132 housing units for Jewish settlers in Arab East Jerusalem . 
in a letter to council President Francesco Paolo Fulci , the PLO &apos;s U.N. observer , Nasser al-Kidwa , said Israel was &quot; following an illegal and dangerous path &quot; which violated the Fourth Geneva Convention and U.N. resolutions . 
he also said Israel was violating a 1993 accord with the PLO in which they agreed to negotiate the status of Jerusalem , among other things , as part of a final settlement . 
Al-Kidwa , who did not request a council meeting , said Israel &apos;s plan for the Ras Al-Amud neighbourhood , inhabited by 11,000 Palestinians , &quot; is tampering with the sensitive and precarious issue of Jerusalem . 
&quot; It is completely illegal under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions . 
it threatens to shatter the Middle East peace process and thus threaten international peace and security . 
he said the council had the responsibility to act on behalf of the international community to &quot; prevent such developments , to protect the peace process and to guarantee respect for the council &apos;s resolutions &quot; and for international law . 
&quot; accordingly , we request that the council formally consider the matter and urgently take the necessary measures in this regard , &quot; he added .
