newspapers reported on Wednesday that Bonn &apos;s defence budget may be too tight this year and in 1997 to start paying for the 140 Eurofighter jets it wants to modernise Germany &apos;s strike force over the next 10 years . 
defence sources say the Eurofighters are German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe &apos;s top priority , but experts have asked how he will find the cash after Chancellor Helmut Kohl cut the defence budget as part of a sweeping austerity drive . 
the dailies Die Welt and Sueddeutsche Zeitung said members of the parliamentary budget committee had considered temporary financial measures if the money could not be found . 
die Welt quoted Dietrich Austermann , a member of the budget committee , as saying there was no money to make the first of a series of annual payments this year and he did not know how the shortfall would be made up . 
the papers said committee members had considered a credit or supplementary budget but doubted whether this was possible . 
a defence ministry spokesman dismissed the reports as speculation and said the government was sure it would find the cash earmarked for the planes this year and in 1997 . 
&quot; There is no fear that the money won &apos;t be there . 
we presume it will be possible to pay for the jets in 1996 and 1997 , &quot; he said . 
the papers said the government would decide later this year , when parliament is due to approve the purchase , when to place its order with the four-nation European consortium . 
Kohl set defence spending at 46.6 billion marks ( $ 30.8 billion ) next year , down from 47.1 billion this year and well below the 48.5 billion Ruehe had originally been promised . 
his budget was also cut for the following years into the next century . 
the defence ministry spokesman said funding was not an issue yet because Bonn was still negotiating the price with consortium partners British Aerospace , Daimler Aerospace , Alenia SpA of Italy and Spain &apos;s Casa . 
it would not be the first time the project had been delayed after years of political wrangling and technical hitches . 
Germany , Italy and Spain are under growing pressure to place their orders by the end of the year , after Britain said earlier this month it wanted to buy 232 Eurofighters and urged them to follow suit so production could get under way .
