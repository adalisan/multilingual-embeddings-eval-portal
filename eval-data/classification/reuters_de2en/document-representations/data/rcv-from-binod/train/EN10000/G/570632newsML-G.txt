German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe said on Thursday that the Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania would definitely be admitted to NATO at some point , even if not in the first wave of new members . 
speaking at a news conference ending a three-day meeting in Denmark with his Danish and Polish counterparts , Ruehe cited Poland as a country that had worked hard in recent years to build relations with the Western defence alliance . 
&quot; I can only advise the Balts to co-operate closely so that they do not lose time . 
one day they will be members of NATO , there is no doubt , &quot; he said . 
Baltic defence ministers attended the last day of the talks , routinely held every six months , in the northern Danish port of Skaggen . 
a NATO summit in Madrid in July is expected to invite Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic to be the first former east bloc states to join their erstwhile foe . 
the change is likely to be grudgingly accepted by Russia , which argues that eastward NATO expansion threatens its own security . 
but Russian diplomats say that Moscow &apos;s opposition to membership for the Baltic states , once part of the Soviet Union itself as opposed to Warsaw Pact allies , will be intense . 
at the Skaggen talks Ruehe , Denmark &apos;s Hans Haekkerup and Poland &apos;s Stanislaw Dobrzanski agreed to invite their Baltic colleagues to annual informal talks , the next to be held in Germany in February 1998 . 
they also decided to invite Baltic forces to join Danish , German and Polish joint military excercises . 
Denmark last October hosted troops from Poland and the Baltic states to train under Nordic and German instructors for theoretical future joint peacekeeeping missions .
