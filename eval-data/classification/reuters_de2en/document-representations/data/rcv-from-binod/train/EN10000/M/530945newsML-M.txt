wall Street stocks are expected to open lower with bonds on Wednesday as the equity market comes in for profit-taking , after the Dow rallied 173 points yesterday , the second biggest advance in its history . 
&quot; There will be some predictable profit-taking at the start , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; It seems that yesterday &apos;s euphoria in the bond and stock markets wore off overnight . 
everyone is back to worrying about all the numbers that will come out next week , including the April employment report . 
U.S. treasuries moved lower , with the long bond down 6 / 32 to yield 7.06 percent . 
the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500 Index futures contract for June was down 1.15 at 779.70 . 
Johnson said that a decline in the stock market would be moderated by the flow of good earnings reports .
