French bond futures continued their steady march towards fresh highs , buoyed by a positive German bond market , while December PIBOR finally breached the top of the trading range it has been stuck in for the past 19 sessions . 
the December bond future set a new high at 128.06 and settled at 128.04 . 
traders gave a mixed outlook . 
some said 128.06 was as far as the contract could go for now and that it looked overbought from a technical viewpoint . 
other said Tuesday &apos;s move merely put the next objective of 128.50 in view , although the reaction to key German data out later this week would be crucial . 
after a lengthy period of range trading , optimism that the Bank of France could cut rates as soon as next week and that the December PIBOR contract was more likely to move towards three-month cash rates than vice versa , boosted the future . 
traders said the move above 96.50 had prompted a series of U.S. funds to close out short positions , pushing the contract to a new high of 96.53 , and that the move brought 96.60 in as the next target . 
&quot; We should now push onto 96.56 and then 96.60 , &quot; said an PIBOR trader at a U.S. house in Paris . 
the implied three-month interest rate remained 10 basis points above three-month cash rates . 
traders said there was still a good chance French call money would be eased soon , despite repeated disappointment since the Bank of France last cut the intervention rate on October 31 . 
an options trader at a French brokerage said those who were short had probably just got tired of losing a couple of centimes everyday and decided to cut their loses . 
an options broker at a French brokerage said &quot; People were pretty short and they were running after 96.49 / 50 . 
now we &apos;re well poised for 96.60 . 
he said there had been a lot of buying of calls on the December PIBOR contract at 96.50 and 96.70 . 
he said the activity was fuelled partly because volatility had dropped to 18.50 percent after the prolonged period of range trading , historically low for PIBOR contracts . 
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t advise anyone to sell volatility at the moment , &quot; he said . 
the positive tone to December PIBOR brought the spread over Euromarks into 28 basis points , close to its lowest level for the year . 
the franc moved higher in thin trading late on Tuesday after trading at lower levels most of the day . 
it reached a high of 3.3804 up from 3.3814 late on Monday and the day &apos;s low of 3.3837 per mark . 
the Treasury announced it would be selling 16 to 18 billion francs of the current two- and five-year benchmark BTANs at its regular monthly auction on Thursday .
