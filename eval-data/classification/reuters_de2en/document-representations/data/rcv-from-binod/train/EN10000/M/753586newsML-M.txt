the rupee closed at 35.7000 / 7050 versus the dollar in lacklustre trade on Thursday , dealers said . 
the day opened steady at 35.69 / 70 with the rupee expected to move in a tight range in anticipation of continued Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) action to prop up the dollar . 
&quot; The RBI kept behind the scenes but was buying dollars from those who went to him , &quot; a dealer at a foreign bank said . 
many dealers had expected the State Bank of India ( SBI ) to resume dollar purchases , saying it was quite some time since India &apos;s leading bank had bought dollars . 
SBI &apos;s purchases usually move the spot rupee-dollar market though of late the bank has gone slow on its buying and allowed the central bank to move into the centrestage . 
&quot; SBI was bidding at 35.7050 , but was not active , &quot; said a dealer at another public sector bank . 
the chief dealer at a foreign bank said lack of demand was hurting trade rather than oversupply of dollars . 
for the first time in recent months , the latest figures released by the Bombay Stock Exchange ( BSE ) showed negative inflow . 
dealers said the forward dollar market saw some paying pressure , referring to payment of premiums to book forward dollars . 
&quot; June dollars closed two paise higher at 135 paise , &quot; said a dealer . 
the six-month annualised premium ended Thursday at 3.75 percent compared to the previous close of 3.52 percent . 
one dealer attributed the spurt in premiums to an auction of 50-billion-rupee government stock scheduled for Monday . 
&quot; That &apos;s a big amount , &quot; said a dealer . 
&quot; For the first time , the market is sitting up and wondering if anything is happening to the excess liquidity we have been used to in recent months . 
but dealers said the excess liquidity with banks was so huge that the auction would not make a major dent . 
&quot; It &apos;s just that people are a little cautious for a few days , &quot; a dealer said .
