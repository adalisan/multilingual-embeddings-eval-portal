the Venezuelan Bolivar closed softer in quiet trade at 487.50 / 488.50 per dollar as the Central Bank hung back from supplying the market with liquidity , traders said . 
the Bolivar closed Wednesday at 487.00 / 488.00 per dollar . 
&quot; The market was dry . 
the Central Bank came in from time to time , but sold only very few dollars and because of that the exchange rate rose , &quot; said one trader . 
traders added that dollar supply from stock market brokerages was not enough to make up the difference . 
the Caracas Bolsa has soared in recent days on strong foreign bids . 
Venezuela &apos;s foreign exchange market is unusual in that the Central Bank is its largest single supplier of dollars , which blurs the difference between the Central Bank supplying liquidity and intervening .
