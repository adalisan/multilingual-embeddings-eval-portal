China on Saturday ignored attacks on its plans to curb civil liberties in Hong Kong and moved to select the head of a provisional legislature that will make the territory &apos;s laws after Beijing takes over in July . 
the 60-member provisional legislature launched into its first session over the border in the Chinese city of Shenzhen to avoid legal challenges to its legitimacy in Hong Kong itself . 
the lawmakers were to elect a president of the body , choosing between the incumbent speaker of Hong Kong &apos;s elected Legislative Council , Andrew Wong , who recently moved into the pro-China camp , and pro-Beijing politician Rita Fan . 
the meeting is taking place in Shenzhen to shield it from legal threats from democracy groups who have branded it illegal and vowed to go to court if the assembly attempts to legislate or to meet in Hong Kong before the handover . 
visiting journalists were kept at arms length from the gathering by Chinese officials who threw up a strong security operation in Shenzhen in case of protests . 
the session was not open to the general public , unlike Hong Kong &apos;s legislature . 
Britain , which hands the colony back to China at midnight on June 30 , has challenged Beijing to go with it to the world court in The Hague for a ruling on whether the provisional body violates the treaty on the sovereignty transfer . 
the body was picked by a Chinese-appointed panel in December to replace the elected chamber and undo the democratic reforms of Chris Patten , the last British governor of Hong Kong . 
a fresh quarrel flared this week as Britain attacked China over a plan to roll back Hong Kong &apos;s Bill of Rights and laws on freedom of association . 
the Amnesty International human rights group said China would use the changes to restrict protests . 
China fended off the attacks , calling them unwise . 
undaunted by accusations that he is pandering to Chinese autocrats , post-colonial leader Tung Chee-hwa announced a post-handover advisory cabinet team on Friday night that gave prominance to pro-China and pro-business conservatives . 
Beijing has maintained it had no choice but to set up the alternative lawmaking body after Britain unilaterally introduced electoral reforms that governed the 1995 legislative elections . 
China has promised the provisional legislature will not act as a rival to the existing chamber in the months leading to the handover , but it remains unclear just what members will do . 
Patten reflected the general frustration on last week . 
&quot; It &apos;s said by ( Chinese Foreign Minister ) Qian Qichen not to be a legislature . 
it &apos;s clearly going to be a rather exotic debating society which meets on occasional Saturdays , &quot; he said . 
Wong , who is one of about 30 members of the present legislature selected for the provisional chamber , is one of two candidates contending to lead the new legislature . 
he said that it was unclear what the body &apos;s exact role was going to be , but that things could become clearer on Saturday . 
&quot; Clearly , it has no legal status under Hong Kong &apos;s present constitution ... 
it &apos;s a body totally unknown to present or future law , &quot; said expert Nihal Jayawickrama of Hong Kong University . 
experts say a legal challenge is only likely if the provisional legislature conducts actual lawmaking activities or confuses the public by publishing new laws in newspapers . 
democratic Party leader Martin Lee , a strong opponent of the provisional legislature , has said he will sue the body if it meets in Hong Kong before July 1 . 
the ambiguity of the legislature &apos;s legal status did not make it any less real , however . 
&quot; I can &apos;t offer an opinion on whether it &apos;s legitimate ... it is a reality and one has to face it , &quot; said Wong .
