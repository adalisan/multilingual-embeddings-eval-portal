the PLO office in Washington will formally suspend its operations at midnight on Tuesday after Congress allowed its permit to lapse , but Palestinian officials said they would still turn up for work on Wednesday . 
Khalio Foutah , Deputy Director of the Palestine Liberation Organisation office , said : &quot; We obey the law and from midnight we will not be the PLO representative office . 
but he told Reuters that , as with two earlier lapses in authority in previous years : &quot; We will come in but we will not work for the PLO . 
the hiatus is essentially a technical , not a political matter . 
it occurred because Congress failed to pass its annual foreign aid bill as planned before its summer recess . 
the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act , providing funds for the Palestinian Authority and allowing the PLO to operate an office under its name in Washington , is part of that bill . 
it will be taken up after Congress resumes in September . 
State Department spokesman James Rubin made clear to reporters the suspension would not interfere with contacts between the U.S. government and the Palestinian leadership . 
&quot; The letterhead has to change . 
and the way in which the phone is answered has to change , &quot; Rubin said . 
but he added the Palestinian officials will &quot; probably be going to work at the same address . 
he added : &quot; We will continue our diplomatic efforts in the region . 
but as far as the office is concerned ... it &apos;s in suspension , or it will be in suspension . 
asked whether the State Department would continue contacts with the Washington office , he said : &quot; We believe that we can have diplomatic contact with representatives of the Palestinian Authority . 
Foutah agreed it was &quot; a technical issue , &quot; but he said : &quot; It is upsetting . 
it is not right . 
it shouldn &apos;t happen . 
he pointed out that the United States was currently engaged in a new initiative to restore the Middle East peace process which includes direct talks between U.S. mediator Dennis Ross and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat . 
Palestinian officials said the Palestinians have had a representative office in the U.S. capital since 1979 under various names . 
the Palestine Information Office was closed in the mid-1980s by a government executive order but in a few days it was operating again in new premises under the name Palestine Affairs Centre , they said . 
the officials said that after the Oslo accords between the Palestinians and the Israelis were reached in 1993 the operation changed its name again , becoming the PLO representative office .
