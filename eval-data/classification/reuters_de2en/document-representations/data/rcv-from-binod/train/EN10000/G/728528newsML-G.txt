vital repairs to the crippled Mir space station may not take place for about ten more days because its Russian commander has developed a minor heart condition , mission doctor Igor Goncharov said on Tuesday . 
Goncharov said Vasily Tsibliyev , 43 , needed time to recover from the problem of an irregular heartbeat . 
even if NASA astronaut Michael Foale took his place he would need a similar time to prepare to repair damage caused by collision with a cargo ship . 
Goncharov said Mission Control was anxious not to delay the work -- to boost Mir &apos;s power supply -- for too long . 
it had been due to be carried out on Friday or Saturday . 
mission director Vladimir Solovyov said there was no question of Tsibliyev being evacuated . 
&quot; People on Earth go to work quite normally with such problems , &quot; he said . 
Goncharov said doctors had noticed Tsibliyev &apos;s heartbeat was irregular on Sunday , although reporters first heard of it when Tsibliyev referred to it in a television link-up a day later . 
asked what could have caused the problem , the doctor said it was most likely to be stress . 
&quot; Naturally the inner anxiety , emotional stress and the feeling of responsibility which he is suffering is all having an effect on him , &quot; Goncharov said . 
the crew has been on tenterhooks since June 25 , when the station suffered the worst accident in its history . 
an unmanned cargo craft collided with one of the modules on Mir . 
the crew had to act fast to stop their air escaping into space . 
Russian media said officials blamed Tsibliyev , who has been on Mir since February , for causing the original accident by failing to reprogramme his controls to take account of waste being carried by the cargo craft he was manoeuvring on June 25 . 
mission Control refused to confirm or deny the reports . 
Tsibliyev had been due to do the repair work with fellow Russian Alexander Lazutkin , 39 , while Foale manned the escape capsule . 
but a NASA official said Russian mission controllers had asked that Foale be prepared to do the repairs . 
&quot; If it is necessary we can do this , &quot; Philip Engelauf told reporters , adding that Foale had been fully trained . 
but Solovyov said no formal request had been made . 
Goncharov said the British-born American would still need about 10 days to prepare . 
&quot; I am sure that as a courageous man he would be ready to do it , &quot; Solovyov said . 
asked how long Tsibliyev would need to recuperate , Goncharov said : &quot; At best , ten days &quot; . 
but he noted that that would put the repair off until July 25 , leaving only 11 days before the relief crew is due to blast off . 
&quot; So maybe it would be in eight days , &quot; Goncharov concluded . 
mission control officials want to get the repair job over in good time before the Soyuz blasts off from Baikonur in case any extra equipment is found to be needed for further repairs . 
a NASA representative said earlier that the delay in the repair work could put off the launch of the relief crew &apos;s craft . 
&quot; It looks like the repairs sortie is postponed -- and this fact may affect the date of the launch of a fresh crew , &quot; the U.S. space agency representative told Reuters at Russian Mission Control near Moscow . 
the three-man Russian-French crew was due to take off for Mir on August 5 . 
a medical council was meeting to decide what to recommend to Tsibliyev . 
&quot; There was an indication of arythmia which we have made more checks on ... But he is able to work and is active &quot; Goncharov said , adding that doctors would focus on his work and sleep schedule and perhaps recommend medicine . 
during a radio link-up , Russian ground staff were heard by journalists telling Tsibliyev to do what he could to pass his experience of space walks to Foale , but also to tell the American he should not feel under pressure to accept the job .
