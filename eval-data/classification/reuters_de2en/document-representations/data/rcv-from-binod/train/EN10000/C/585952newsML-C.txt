Slovakofarma a.s. , Slovakia &apos;s largest drug producer , will pay a 220 crown dividend each for ordinary share and 230 crowns each for employee share the official TASR news agency reported on Thursday . 
TASR said the firm posted a 1996 consolidated net profit , calculated according to international standards of 512.9 million crowns . 
Slovakofarma paid a 250 crown per share dividend -- the highest dividend paid so far by a publicly traded Slovak company -- from its 1995 net profit of 481.2 million crowns . 
the company &apos;s overall 1996 turnover was 4.97 billion TASR said , quoting its annual report presented to a shareholders &apos; meeting held at company headquarters in Hlohovec , western Slovakia . 
in 1995 , the firm posted overall turnover of 4.34 billion crowns and 3.65 billion crowns in 1994 . 
TASR said the company &apos;s basic assets totalled 1.52 billion crowns at the end of 1996 . 
Slovakofarma has been one of the fastest rising issues on the unlisted market of the Bratislava Stock Exchange ( BSE ) and was quoted at 4,300 crowns on Wednesday after climbing from some 3,600 crowns at the beginning of February to some 4,800 crowns in the middle of that month . 
brokers say the issue has the potential to rise to around 5,000 crowns , but that its problem is low liquidity resulting from lack of shares on the market . 
the favourable financial results enabled the company to continue an ambitious investment programme aimed at modernising production , expansion and ecological projects worth 616 million crowns .
