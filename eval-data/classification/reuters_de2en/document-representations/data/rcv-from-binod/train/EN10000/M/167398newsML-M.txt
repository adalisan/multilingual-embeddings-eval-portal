international investors , attracted by sterling &apos;s recent winning streak , are starting to look at the British gilt market for value , analysts said on Tuesday . 
sterling has risen more than eight percent since early August , and this , coupled with last week &apos;s surprise increase in interest rates , has not been fully reflected in the performance of gilts on a relative basis , they said . 
&quot; We are seeing a creeping sentiment change , &quot; said Brian Venables , senior bond analyst at ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett in Amsterdam . 
&quot; Everyone has been watching sterling , thinking it was a nine-day wonder . 
now that it doesn &apos;t seem that way , people are reassessing the market , &quot; he said . 
sterling topped $ 1.6500 for the first time since March 1995 in European trade on Tuesday , and also reached 2.50 marks , the highest level since June 1994 . 
analysts pointed to the recent underperformance of gilts which have seen Swedish and Spanish bonds narrow their spread over Bunds to levels below that of gilts . 
by 1145 GMT , 10-year Swedish bonds were trading at 153 basis points above comparable Bunds , while Spanish bonds were at 181 points . 
gilts , meanwhile , were at 183 points over Bunds . 
&quot; When gilts started underperforming last week , we started seeing overseas investors looking for value , &quot; said Huw Roberts , European bond strategist at NatWest Capital Markets . 
&quot; International funds are certainly interested . 
analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke &apos;s decision to raise base rates by 25 basis points to 6.0 percent on October 30 had removed some uncertainty from the market , and had helped calm inflation fears . 
they said the move would also increase the likelihood that the Bank of England &apos;s quarterly inflation report , due on Wednesday , will adopt a less gloomy tone on the prospects for inflationary pressures in the British economy . 
although the Bank is unlikely to change its view that inflation is set to miss the government &apos;s 2.5 percent target over the medium-term , analysts said they will be watching for signs that the chancellor and the Bank are more in agreement . 
&quot; The rate hike should have bought the chancellor some improvement in the report &apos;s tone , &quot; said Simon Briscoe , chief UK economist at Nikko Europe in London . 
&quot; Had he not raised rates , certainly the tone would be more negative . 
preliminary data showed GDP growth of 0.8 percent in the third quarter , which gives an annualised growth rate of 3.2 percent . 
another attraction for the market , Briscoe said , was the limited supply of medium- and long-term paper on offer by the government in the immediate future . 
the next auction of medium- and long-term government paper is not expected until early in 1997 , analysts said . 
&quot; The supply / demand arithmetic is good , &quot; said Briscoe . 
&quot; medium- and long-term paper is limited , and demand from domestics alone is running at 2.5 billion stg a month . 
however , Briscoe said there were still concerns that the November 26 budget might deliver large tax cuts , and this would limit the performance of gilts until the budget was out of the way . 
he said the 10-year spread would move to 150 basis points in the next quarter . 
he said the five-year to 25-year gilt spread was currently 63 points , compared with a high last month of 90 points . 
&quot; If you want to escape the volatility in Europe , gilts look like a good long-term investment , &quot; said Venables of ABN-AMRO . 
&quot; The 10-years and out are particularly good .
