Haitian officials announced on Wednesday that runoff parliamentary elections would take place as scheduled on Sunday , amid reports of international pressure to postpone the vote . 
&quot; At this juncture , the politics of the country are difficult , but it is our job to organise these elections , &quot; Provisional Electoral Council official Jean Pierre said . 
Haitian voters were to go to the polls and elect seven members of the nation &apos;s 27-seat Senate in a vote that could determine the future of the U.S.-backed Haitian government plan to privatise state-run industries . 
the election was scheduled against a background of violence . 
last week , students protesting a teachers &apos; strike threw rocks and violent mobs ran through Port-au-Prince . 
and a general strike cleared the capital &apos;s streets on Monday . 
last Wednesday , anti-government demonstrators broke car windscreens , threw Molotov cocktails and set up burning tire barricades in the southern city of Cayes . 
in the northern city of Gonaive , tire-burning demonstrators prompted a special deployment of the Haitian National Police . 
Tuesday night , an election office in Gonaive was burned down in an arson attack . 
diplomats said political considerations were behind pressure from the United Nations and other international entities to postpone the vote . 
the U.S. embassy declined to comment . 
U.N. development officials , who were helping deliver ballots throughout the country suspended that work last Sunday , asking election officials to postpone the balloting until a later date , diplomatic sources said .
