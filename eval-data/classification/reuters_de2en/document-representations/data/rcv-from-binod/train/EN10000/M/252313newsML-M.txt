U.S. cash crude prices rose late Thursday on the back of a U.S. refinery fire and technical support , while grades were mixed in thin trading . 
January West Texas Intermediate / Cushing stood around $ 23.75-85 a barrel , up 40 cts from late Wednesday . 
the Jan / Feb WTI spread was at 52 cents , up three cents . 
the key driver behind the day &apos;s recovery was an outage at the fluid catalytic cracking ( FCC ) unit at Tosco &apos;s Bayway , New Jersey refinery . 
sources familiar with the company &apos;s operations couldn &apos;t say when the facility will be back on line . 
activity was thin because many traders are attending an annual holiday gathering in New Orleans , Louisiana , and are not expected back until Monday . 
grade business was subdued . 
light Louisiana sweet / St. 
James changed hands at a steady 72 cents premium to WTI / Cushing , even with Wednesday . 
the grade has weakened over the past week , partly in response to incoming VLCCs from the North Sea , traders said . 
the softening has discouraged some refiners from picking up foreign crudes , although others are showing a limited appetite . 
West Texas sour / Midland continued to pick up steam , although traders could find no fundamental reason for the upturn . 
&quot; ( The strengthening of sours ) could just be psychological after so much weakness , &quot; one broker mused .
