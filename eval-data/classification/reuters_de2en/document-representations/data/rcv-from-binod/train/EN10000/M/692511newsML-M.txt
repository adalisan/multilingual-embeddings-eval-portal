U.S. blue chips ended with modest gains on Friday , snapping a two-session losing streak at the close of a week of volatile trading on Wall Street . 
a firm bond market , investor conviction that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates at a policy meeting next week , and buying by portfolio managers at the end of the quarter supported stocks , traders said . 
the Dow finished up 33 points , or 0.4 percent , at 7688 . 
but the average had been as many as 116 points higher before late-session profit taking shaved gains . 
advancing issues beat decliners by a two-to-one ratio on the New York Stock Exchange on active volume of about 470 million shares . 
the Nasdaq composite ended with a two point rise to 1438 . 
for the week , the Dow finished with a loss of about 109 points , or 1.5 percent . 
this came after a near 200-point drop Monday triggered by remarks from Japan &apos;s prime minister and a rebound of more than 150 points Tuesday . 
&quot; Nothing much has happened , but you &apos;ve travelled a lot of miles in between , &quot; said Alfred Kugel , senior investment strategist at Stein roe &amp; Farnham . 
the Dow ended last week at a record high of 7796.51 , a 22 percent rise from its 1997 closing low at 6391.69 on April 11 . 
market analysts attributed this week &apos;s sharp swings to a general nervousness among investors holding big gains after the 10-week rise of more than 1,400 points . 
&quot; That &apos;s what the volatility shows , &quot; said James Melcher , president at Balestra Capital . 
the stock market &quot; is edgy all right , and it ought to be . 
on Friday stocks received support from bonds , which broke out of a week-long slide , lifted by the Federal Reserve &apos;s purchase of coupons and short covering . 
the 30-year Treasury bond rose 14 / 32 , its yield dropping to 6.75 percent from Thursday &apos;s close at 6.78 percent . 
wall Street &apos;s next hurdle will come Tuesday and Wednesday when the Fed &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee will meet on interest-rate policy . 
the consensus on Wall Street is that the central bank will leave rates unchanged . 
&quot; If the Fed does anything , it will be a big surprise to the Street , &quot; said Brian Finnerty , senior vice president at Unterberg Harris . 
NationsBank Corp fell 1-3 / 8 to 65-1 / 4 amid reports it would soon announce it will buy closely held investment bank Montgomery Securities . 
another investment bank , Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc fell 1-7 / 8 to 32-1 / 4 after a Smith Barney analyst downgraded his rating on the stock , saying recent takeover speculation had bloated its share price . 
two initial public stock offerings attracted buyers . 
JLK Direct Distribution Inc , distributors of metal cutting tools , rose 5-1 / 2 to 25-1 / 2 . 
heating and air conditioning company Comfort Systems USA Inc rose three to 16 .

it said it expects to take a pretax writedown of about $ 150- $ 200 million in the quarter ending June 30 as a result of disappointing drilling results in Louisiana . 
the Nasdaq composite rose 1.77 to 1438.15 .
