Lehman Brothers expects the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise rates by 25 basis points at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 24 , John Llewellyn , Lehman &apos;s chief global economist , said on Monday . 
&quot; Our judgment is that will prove just enough to cap the economy and inflationary risk and thereafter ... the rise in rates that the market foresees next year won &apos;t be necessary , &quot; Llewellyn said . 
the rate increase will allow the U.S. economy to continue expanding for at least another year or two , and possibly more , but more slowly , Lewellyn said . 
the economic growth rates of the three major developed regions -- Europe , the United States and Japan -- will converge at about two percent by 1997 , Llewellyn added . 
Japan is expected to raise short-term rates later this year and could push short-term rates up faster than the market forecasts if the government relaxes fiscal policy ahead of an expected general election next July , Llewellyn said . 
Lehman sees Japan &apos;s growth rate evening out at about 2.5 percent over the next 18 months . 
in Germany , Llewellyn counters the consensus market view by forecasting unchanged interest rates . 
growth and inflation rates below two percent combined with a recent 30-basis point cut in the repo rate will push the government in favour of a real fiscal tightening equivalent to 0.5-0.75 percent of gross domestic product , he said . 
but this forecast could change if the Deutschemark firms in response to attempts to forge the European Monetary Union ( EMU ) . 
&quot; We feel the market has it wrong by failing to recognise Germany is in a unique situation , &quot; Llewellyn said . 
both Germany and France are determined to steam ahead with the EMU , and substantial European foreign exchange volatility can be expected in the coming months as the pact is negotiated . 
&quot; Between now and the end of the year some very , very difficult negotiations are going to have to take place on fixing of the stability peg , &quot; he said . 
&quot; spreads between core Europe and non-core Europe will be widening and narrowing , but we do expect the pact to be signed and the spreads will suddenly come in with a bang . 
Llewellyn expects to see a small EMU established in 1999 involving Germany , France , the Netherlands and Belgium / Luxembourg .
