Southeast Asian rubber business is likely to be slow this week with the onset of the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan and ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday period in early February , traders said on Monday . 
&quot; It &apos;s Ramadan as usual . 
supplies will fall as many tappers slow down during the fasting month , &quot; one dealer in the Indonesian rubber centre of Medan said . 
&quot; Markets around the region will also not move much ahead of the Chinese New Year holidays . 
we &apos;ll probably get a better show only after the holidays , &quot; a senior dealer for a Japanese rubber trading company in Singapore added . 
traders said there would be no incentive for players to take positions in markets before the end of Ramadan on February 9 and the Lunar New Year on February 7 and 8 . 
&quot; People would want to spend a quiet Chinese New Year rather than worry about their positions , &quot; a dealer for a North American rubber trading firm in Singapore said . 
one dealer said the lower supply was unlikely to have much impact on buying patterns in the United States , where most of Indonesia &apos;s rubber is sold , and U.S. purchasing is not expected to slow . 
Indonesian dealers said January high amoniac grade latex offer prices were seen remaining stable at around 2,150 rupiah a kg in Bandung and Tangerang in slow trade , after slipping slightly from about 2,175 rupiah a kg previously . 
recent favourable weather had boosted latex supply to the market , dampening the prospect for price rises , they said . 
in Thailand , rubber supply rose more than fourfold last week from the previous week , trade sources said . 
the end of the prolonged monsoon season has encouraged farmers to tap more rubber and supplies entering the Thai market jumped by 447 percent to 165,105 kg , they said . 
&quot; They ( farmers ) tap and tap and tap . 
perhaps they are just making up for the lost time , &quot; said a trader in hat Yai , referring to heavy rains which flooded parts of southern Thailand in December . 
other traders said they believed the yen &apos;s recent weak tone had also discouraged buyers from entering the market . 
&quot; But now that the situation has improved , more Japanese buyers might enter the market , &quot; one trader said . 
the price of benchmark RSS3 for February shipment was quoted around US $ 1.23- $ 1.24 a kg fob Bangkok compared with between $ 1.25- $ 1.26 a kg a week ago . 
Latex prices also eased to $ 0.93 a kg on the same basis against the previous $ 0.94-0.95 a kg . 
in Malaysia , prices look set to soften this week due to the strong ringgit and ample supply of latex and other raw materials , traders said . 
the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board quoted benchmark RSS1 grade at 306.50 Malaysian cents a kg and SMR20 at 304 cents a kg , both for February buyer , at the close of the market last week . 
traders said the ringgit had risen too strongly against the U.S. dollar in the last week and a technical correction to local rubber prices was necessary if buyers were going to take a serious look at the Malaysian market . 
&quot; The price adjustments have to be done , as the ringgit is too strong ( for the buyers ) to come in , &quot; a trader said . 
he said that technically , SMR20 always traded at a premium against RSS1 &quot; but now the situation is in reverse &quot; . 
traders also said favourable weather since the start of January had created comfortable stocks of latex and other raw materials and prices were now under pressure to ease . 
drum latex was offered by trading houses at 240 cents a kg fob on Friday . 
the Malaysian rubber market has largely been in the doldrums since October with most institutional buyers from Europe and the United States having met their quota of purchases until the first quarter of 1997 , traders said . 
but shortcovering by buyers could continue , they said . 
&quot; We are in fact already advising some of our European clients to start buying by February for the second quarter to facilitate prompt delivery , &quot; said a dealer with a foreign-owned rubber broking house in Kuala Lumpur . 
traders said a clearer buying trend may not emerge until the end of February due to the onset of the wintering season and the week-long EID al-Fitr , ending Ramadan , and Chinese New Year holidays .
