Thai Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya said on Tuesday Thailand would maintain tight fiscal and monetary policies to comply with a financial bailout package sponsored by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) . 
he told a news conference that the authorities would adopt austerity measures to curb capital outflows and help maintain a surplus in the 1997 / 1998 ( October-September ) budget . 
Thailand &apos;s five-point letter of intent seeking help from the IMF covered loan details , economic targets , policy obligations , and information disclosure . 
Thailand has secured a $ 16.7 billion bailout package expected to be approved by the IMF board this week . 
Thailand said a $ 4 billion IMF stand-by credit will be used to replenish its dwindling foreign reserves and finance the balance of payments deficit but it will not be for bailing out the ailing financial sector . 
Thailand said with the IMF package its economy would grow 3.0-4.0 percent during 1997 and 1998 , and recover to 6.0-7.0 percent later . 
the authorities will also aim to keep foreign reserves at $ 23 billion in 1997 and $ 25 billion in 1998 , or an eqivalent of four months of imports , Finance Minister Thanong said . 
on information disclosure , Thailand will from August 29 announce fortnightly its foreign reserves , central bank assets and liabilities . 
the finance ministry and the central bank will also disclose non-performing loans of the private financial sector on a regular basis , he said .
