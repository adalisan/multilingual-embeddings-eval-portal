twelve seamen are dead after an apparent mutiny in the South Pacific on a Honduran-registered fishing boat , Korean police said on Sunday . 
the boat was found by a Japanese maritime police vessel drifting without fuel early on Sunday . 
ethnic Koreans from China apparently staged a shipboard uprising after complaints of hard work , the spokesman said by telephone from the port of Pusan . 
among the dead are the South Korean captain , six other South Koreans , four Indonesians and one Chinese-Korean . 
all the bodies had been thrown overboard , the spokesman said . 
thirteen crewmembers remained on the vessel , including six alleged mutineers who were all ethnic Korean Chinese and were now under the control of six Indonesians and a South Korean , the spokesman said . 
&quot; This is an obvious mutiny by Koreans from China who felt unhappy with their working conditions , &quot; he said . 
it was not immediately clear when the mutiny took place , but all contact with the ship , the Peskamar 15 , was lost on August 3 as it sailed towards the South Pacific island of Samoa . 
the boat is managed by a South Korean fishing company , Daehyun , and was fishing for tuna . 
the spokesman said a Japanese vessel on Saturday picked up a distress signal from the stricken boat . 
the maritime vessel reached the scene early Sunday morning . 
South Korea &apos;s Yonhap news agency said the fishing boat left Pusan on July 14 . 
Korean employers around Asia have earned a reputation for tough , and at times brutal , management of their workers .
