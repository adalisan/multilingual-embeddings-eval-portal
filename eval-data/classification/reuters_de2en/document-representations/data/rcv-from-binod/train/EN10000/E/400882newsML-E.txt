Argentina &apos;s province of Buenos Aires has cancelled a large part of its debt , reducing interest payments dramatically in the first such operation in the country in 50 years , a top province official said Tuesday . 
&quot; This is excellent news for us , &quot; Jorge Remas Lenicov , the province &apos;s Economy Minister , told Reuters in an interview . 
the operation was carried out by the purchase of $ 292 million worth of zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds which were transferred to state-owned Banco de la Provincia , the province &apos;s chief creditor , explained Lenicov . 
when the zero-coupon bonds mature in 2025 , they will amount to $ 1.906 billion , the current value of Buenos Aires Province &apos;s debt with the bank , which is Argentina &apos;s second largest financial institution . 
the payment will free the province from a previous agreement where it was scheduled to pay back the debt through annual amortization payments running to 2024 . 
it will have the effect of reducing the province &apos;s annual interest payments to 6.35 percent from 8.75 percent . 
&quot; In this way the province wins and the bank wins &quot; because of Provincia &apos;s higher liquidity levels , Lenicov said . 
the operation is the culmination of many years &apos; efforts by the province , which is the most populous in the country with 40 percent of its voters , to consolidate its debt after heavy borrowing in the 1970s and 1980s . 
&quot; This agreement , above all , shows the firm decision by the administration to control public expenditure , &quot; Lenicov said . 
at the beginning of this decade the province made great efforts to cut expenditure , running budget surpluses in 1992 and 1993 and balancing its books in 1994 and 1995 . 
in 1996 tax collections exceeded budget projections thanks to the economic recovery , allowing the province to use its extra funds to purchase the zero-coupon bonds . 
in the early 1990s , the provincial government decided not to take up debt to finance current expenditure . 
debt was only issued to finance infrastructure projects and the province turned to international capital markets and made a decision not to take up any new loans with Banco de la Provincia . 
it made a debut in the international capital markets in 1994 with a $ 100 million three-year bond issue which was followed by five subsequent issues denominated in marks , francs and dollars . 
Lenicov said with that first bond maturing this year , the province will issue a new $ 100 million bond in July or August . 
the cancellation operation reduces Buenos Aires Province &apos;s redeemable debt stock to $ 1.02 billion from $ 2.92 billion . 
it marks the first time in 50 years that such an operation takes place in Argentina said Lenicov . 
the last time was in 1947 when both the national government and the province of Buenos Aires cancelled debt . 
the government of neighboring Chile has carried out similar operations recently .
