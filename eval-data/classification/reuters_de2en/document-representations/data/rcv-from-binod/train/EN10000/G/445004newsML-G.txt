Britain &apos;s opposition Labour Party has extended its lead over the ruling Conservatives by seven points , according to an NOP opinion poll published on Sunday . 
the NOP poll for the Sunday Times put Labour on 52 percent , a three point increase over last month , Conservatives down four on 27 percent and Liberal Democrats unchanged on 13 percent . 
however 25 percent said they had not definitely made up their minds which way they would vote . 
some 54 percent of those questioned said they believed Labour was ahead because Britons felt it was time for a change of government . 
the other main reasons for the Labour lead were , according to the poll , that the Conservatives were doing badly ( 30 percent ) and that Labour had the better policies ( 10 percent ) . 
the NOP survey was carried out on March 13 -- after the Conservatives unveiled key proposals for the reform of pensions , social services and health care for the elderly .
