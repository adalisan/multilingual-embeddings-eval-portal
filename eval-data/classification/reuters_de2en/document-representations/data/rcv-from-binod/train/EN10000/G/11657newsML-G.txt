a six-day courtroom interrogation of a British rape victim by her atttacker provoked calls on Friday for changes to the law that allowed the man to conduct his own defence . 
&quot; I have been raped twice ; once in his filthy den and once in front of judge and jury in a British court of law , &quot; 34-year-old Julia Mason said after the trial . 
Ralston Edwards was found guilty on Thursday of raping Mason on two occasions while he held her imprisoned at his home in London for 18 hours . 
Mason , who took the unusual step of waiving her right to anonymity so she could tell her story to Britain &apos;s media , said she believed Edwards had got further gratification from being allowed to humiliate her in court . 
&quot; He lapped up the exhibitionism and gained perverted pleasure asking me about my private parts and his . 
it was sickening , &quot; she told the Daily Mail newspaper . 
Edwards had a history of offences against women , which under British law could not be revealed to the court during the trial . 
he was jailed in 1984 for raping a neighbour and has been charged three times with actual bodily harm against women . 
the 42-year-old who made a living selling condoms to prostitutes , dismissed his lawyer on the first day of his trial . 
Mason was only informed that he would cross-question her on the day she entered the witness box . 
how could this happen ? 
&quot; she said . 
&quot; The law must be changed . 
Edwards will be sentenced later this month . 
Britain &apos;s interior minister Michael Howard said he would examine the case to see whether changes in the law were needed . 
&quot; If there are lessons to be learned from this case , I am as keen as anyone to learn them , &quot; he said . 
in 1991 , Britain withdrew the right for suspects conducting their own defence to question their alleged victims if they are children . 
women &apos;s groups said they wanted the law extended to prevent them from questioning women in cases of rape and assault . 
they said they feared Mason &apos;s experience would discourage women from reporting sexual crimes in future because of the ordeal they may face in court . 
&quot; This should never have been allowed to happen . 
the judge should have stopped the proceedings , &quot; said Julie Bindel of the International Conference on Women and Violence .
