the site of Britain &apos;s &quot; House of horrors &quot; where Fred and Rosemary West sexually abused and murdered a string of young girls is to be turned into a landscaped pedestrian way , the BBC said on Friday . 
the house , 25 Cromwell Street in Gloucester , western England , was demolished last year after Rosemary West was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of 10 young women , including her eldest daughter . 
her husband Fred killed himself in his prison cell before he could face trial for 12 murders . 
every part of the house , including the bricks , was ground to dust to frustrate ghoulish souvenir hunters . 
police found the mutilated bodies of most of the serial killers &apos; victims buried underneath the house and in the back garden . 
Gloucester council spent months consulting local residents and relatives of the Wests &apos; victims before deciding to turn the site into a pedestrian route . 
they found there was deep hostility to the idea of any memorial marking the scene of Britain &apos;s worst serial murder case .
