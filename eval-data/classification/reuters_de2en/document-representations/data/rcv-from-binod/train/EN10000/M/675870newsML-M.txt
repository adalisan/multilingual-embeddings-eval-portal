Mexican stocks continued their historic advance and soared to their eighth record close in a row on Friday . 
dealers and analysts said further good economic news released during the session kept the bulls charging amid a market awash in foreign capital . 
&quot; The market has broken pre-set objectives , &quot; said hector Jimenez , an analyst at the Inverlat brokerage . 
final closing prices showed the blue chip IPC share index .MXX was up 85.47 points , or 1.96 percent , to a record of 4,439.14 . 
the bourse &apos;s previous record close of 4,353.67 was set on Thursday . 
trading volume .TV.MX was very heavy at 181.2 million shares and clearly reflected a heavy inflow of foreign investors . 
&quot; An additional kicker came in terms of the retail sales figures , which were a pleasant surprise , &quot; said Flix boni , research chief at ING-Barings in Mexico . 
Mexico &apos;s National Statistics Institute announced at midday that April retail sales had increased by 6.6 percent over the same month last year . 
the latest Reuters survey of 13 financial firms MEX22 had forecast an average increase of just 0.17 percent . 
&quot; previously , the rally was fuelled by external and non-economic factors , &quot; boni said . 
&quot; But these two elements , industrial activity and retail sales give more support to the domestic fundamental side , &quot; he added . 
industrial activity data released on Tuesday had also outstripped analysts &apos; expectations . 
analysts agreed foreign capital inflow was part of an ongoing international trend . 
&quot; It ( Mexico ) is a bull market , as is Latin America . 
investors , particularly in North America , are just pouring money into the region , &quot; said Geoffrey Dennis , investment strategist at HSBC-James Capel in New York . 
Dennis said the outlook for low interest rates worldwide had boosted liquidity in equity markets . 
&quot; Money appears to be flowing everywhere , &quot; boni said . 
analysts said Mexico was considered attractive within Latin America as , despite recent gains , it was still relatively cheap in valuation terms and still lagged Brazil . 
nonetheless , the IPC is far behind Brazil &apos;s Bovespa .BVSP in year-to-date terms , having gained 32.08 percent compared to 72.17 percent by its counterpart in Sao Paulo . 
dealers said retail and financial stocks led the rally along with traditional market heavyweight Telmex . 
retailer Cifra &apos;s A or preferred shares were the most heavily traded of the day , and gained 38 centavos to 14.18 pesos . 
fellow retail firm Controladora Comercial Mexicana also posted strong gains at brisk trade , and ended up 14 centavos to 7.08 pesos . 
dealers said the market bought retailers because strong retail sales figures augured healthy earnings in the months ahead . 
in Cifra &apos;s case , dealers said the market also speculated on the share price at which Wal-Mart Stores Inc would settle a recently signed takeover deal . 
Telmex climbed 50 centavos to a record close in pesos of 19.30 , while the telecomms firm &apos;s ADRs ended up 1-1 / 4 to 48-1 / 2 , their highest level since a shock devaluation sent Mexican markets aspin in December 1994 . 
Telmex had traded at more than 70 on Wall Street during February 1994 .
