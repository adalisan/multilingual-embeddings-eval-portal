Iranians began voting on Friday to replace President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who must step down in August after eight years in office . 
Supreme spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , in remarks broadcast by Tehran radio , called on all eligible voters to take an active part in the election . 
some 33,180 polling stations guarded by 200,000 police opened for 10 hours ( corrects from 12 hours ) at 8 : 00 a.m. ( 0330 GMT ) . 
thirty-three million Iranians aged 15 and over are eligible to vote . 
the result looked set to be a close-fought contest between two Shi &apos;ite Moslem clergymen , liberal-minded Mohammad Khatami and conservative Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri . 
two other candidates are standing but believed unlikely to make much impact .
