the Treasury Department on Wednesday announced a $ 39.75 billion quarterly refunding to be held next week . 
Treasury said next week &apos;s auctions will refund $ 18 billion of maturing securities and raise $ 21.75 billion of new cash . 
the auctions will consist of $ 17.75 billion of three-year notes , $ 12 billion of 10-year notes and $ 10 billion of 30-year bonds . 
Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary Roger Anderson said that Treasury plans to reopen its existing 10-year inflation-indexed note when it next sells inflation-protected securities in April . 
&quot; We are very pleased with the reception of this new form of financing , &quot; Anderson said at a press briefing , commenting on Treasury &apos;s initial sale on Jan 29 of $ 7 billion of inflation-indexed notes . 
he also said Treasury was considering tightening rules that now require reporting of net long positions of $ 2 billion or more for any one bidder in a Treasury bill auction . 
Anderson said a private-sector borrowing advisory committee to Treasury had suggested requiring that buyers with net long positions of $ 1 billion or more of an individual bill report their holdings . 
in its report , the Committee said it &quot; voted to recommend that the Treasury reduce the net long position reporting threshold to $ 1 billion for Treasury bill auctions while maintaining the $ 2 billion threshold for note and bond auctions . 
Anderson said that it would make it easier for Treasury to ensure that no bidder violated the rule that prohibits a single bidder from holding more than 35 percent of the securities available at an auction . 
Anderson also said Treasury was considering moving to a requirement for three-decimal bidding on regular Treasury bill auctions with minimum increments of .005 percent that corresponds to one-half basis point . 
the committee said that half-basis-point bidding &quot; will promote more efficient and aggressive bidding and is likely to lead to marginally higher auction revenue for the Treasury . 
it also said that market participants would need very little time to begin half-basis-point bidding since they already trade in such increments in the market . 
at next week &apos;s quarterly refunding , Treasury will offer three-year notes on Tuesday , 10-year notes on Wednesday and 30-year bonds on Thursday . 
after next week &apos;s refunding auctions , Treasury will need to raise $ 40.3 billion in market borrowings during the rest of the first quarter . 
that can be done through regular sales of three- and six-month and one-year bills , and two- and five-year notes in February and March . 
&quot; Cash management bills may be needed to cover the low points in the cash balance in March , &quot; Anderson said . 
as previously reported , the Treasury estimates its net market borrowing will produce a pay down of $ 10-15 billion in the April-June second quarter , assuming a $ 35-billion cash balance on June 30 .
