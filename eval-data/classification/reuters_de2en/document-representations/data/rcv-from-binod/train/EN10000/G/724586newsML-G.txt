political violence has dropped sharply in South Africa since the death of apartheid more than three years ago , but the country &apos;s people still find reasons to kill under President Nelson Mandela . 
according to the non-government Human Rights Committee ( HRC ) , 1,071 people were killed in political violence in the year ending last month . 
slightly less ( corrects from &quot; slightly more &quot; ) than half of the deaths occurred in KwaZulu- Natal province , long notorious for bloody political feuding between Mandela &apos;s African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party , but many of the killings took place in other provinces and for different reasons . 
the HRC said violence in areas like the Gauteng industrial heartland , Eastern Cape and Northern Province since 1994 was related to frustration at slow delivery of housing and other basic services by Mandela &apos;s government . 
Northern Province has also experienced violent protests over the demarcation of provincial boundaries and in Eastern Cape ANC-linked political factions have turned on each other . 
KwaZulu-Natal political analyst Alexander Johnston said the ease with which South Africans resorted to violence was reflected in crime statistics . 
&quot; Political violence is to a large extent the product of a general climate of lawlessness , &quot; said Johnston , a politics professor at the University of Natal . 
&quot; Until a real impression is made on violent crime , which in terms of the number of people killed is a far greater problem , it is unlikely political violence will be eradicated , &quot; he said . 
HRC researcher Makubetse Sekhonyane said that because political violence had diminished so markedly since the 1994 all-race election , it went almost unnoticed at its current levels . 
&quot; We previously had total chaos and what goes on now seems like hardly anything , &quot; he said . 
&quot; People have come from a far worse situation and the killings have now dropped to a level where they are no longer ( as ) alarming . 
Paul Pereira , spokesman for the South African Institute of Race Relations , said the 1994 election had defused much of the tension which led to nearly 3,800 political killings in 1993 . 
&quot; One of the biggest factors in cooling things down since 1994 is the fact that the current government is accepted and structures like the security forces and courts are accepted as legitimate , &quot; he said . 
but in KwaZulu-Natal , where about 15,000 people were killed in the decade up to 1994 , the pacifying effect of the election has been less pervasive . 
senior leaders of the ANC and Inkatha -- which has majority support in the province -- have held almost a year of secret talks to try to stem the violence .
