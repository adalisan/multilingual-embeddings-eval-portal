labour supporters raised deafening cheers and cracked open the champagne but Tony Blair marked his longed-for moment of victory with an emotional tribute to his family and a solemn pledge to serve the people . 
at 43 , Blair was set to become Britain &apos;s youngest prime minister this century as his party headed for a landslide general election victory on Friday , ending 18 years of Conservative rule . 
&quot; You have put your trust in me and I intend to repay that trust . 
I will not let you down , &quot; Blair said in an address after a thumping victory in his Sedgefield parliamentary seat . 
choking back tears , Blair paid tribute to his family , his elderly father and , in the most poignant and personal moment at the end of a slick election campaign , to his late mother . 
&quot; All that could have made this moment complete was that my mother was here as well , &quot; he said . 
Blair has moved Labour to the centre ground since taking over as leader in July 1994 , ditching the party &apos;s socialist ideology . 
in clubs and community halls around the country , Labour supporters were shedding tears of joy as the party swept back to power after four consecutive election defeats dating back to 1979 . 
Blair headed for a Labour party club in Trimdon , a former mining village , where cheers and brass band music hailed first indications of a Labour victory . 
&quot; It &apos;s unbelievable . 
we expected to win but we &apos;re really slaughtering them , &quot; said Ron Heasman , a Labour Party member for 45 years . 
celebrities , actors and businessmen joined thousands of activists at a mass party in London &apos;s Royal Festival Hall , cheering as Conservative seats toppled to Labour in their dozens around the nation . 
&quot; It is just beyond belief . 
it is the stuff that dreams are made of . 
after 18 years of seeing this country sink into selfishness and greed , where only profit mattered , I hope we will have a society again with a social awareness and social conscience , &quot; said playwright Colin Welland . 
in the north-east England stronghold of Sedgefield , Blair said he now looked forward with humility to taking office . 
&quot; It is an honour to serve you . 
I feel at this time a deep sense of honour , a deep sense of responsibility and a deep sense of humility , &quot; Blair said , his voice breaking . 
&quot; I know what this is a vote for , it is a vote for the future , it is not a vote for outdated dogma or ideology of any kind . 
it is a vote for an end to divisions and an end to looking backwards ... 
&quot; We are a great country , the British people are a great people . 
there is no greater honour than to serve them , and serve them we will .
