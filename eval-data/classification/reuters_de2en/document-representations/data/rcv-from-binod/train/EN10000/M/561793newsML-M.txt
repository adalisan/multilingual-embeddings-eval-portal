U.S. debt futures closed mixed , as T-bonds shrugged off the results of the U.S. Treasury &apos;s three-year note auction and recovered late , traders said . 
&quot; locals had a chance to get a bearish signal in place , but couldn &apos;t do it , &quot; one bond futures trader said . 
&quot; A lower close would have told us a different story , &quot; he said , adding that a weak close would have established an outside down day and pointed to near term losses . 
locals were the primary sellers in the bond pit on news the auction produced a yield of 6.44 percent and a bid-to-cover of 2.08 . 
June T-bonds fell below the 110-00 level . 
June , which closed at 110-01 / 32 on Monday , steadily inched lower , as Eurodollars set daily lows on the heels of the sale results . 
dealers were aggressive sellers of Eurodollars , with one U.S. dealer alone selling 2,000 September . 
September immediately fell to 93.845 , near support at 93.83 . 
on Wednesday , the Treasury will sell $ 12 10-year notes . 
aside from the bid-to-cover ratio , several traders in both the bond and Eurodollar pits described the auction as average . 
&quot; Yes , the bid-to-cover was low , but the non-comp bids were higher which means it was spread out and it wasn &apos;t concentrated in a few hands , &quot; one Eurodollar futures trader said . 
Non-comp bids totaled $ 967 million , versus some market estimates of $ 700 million to $ 800 million . 
September Eurodollars eased towards support at 93.83 , but held above that level . 
key support rests at 93.79 and at 93.54 for December . 
December becomes lead contract month on Thursday , the exchange said . 
some traders brushed aside June T-bonds &apos; fall through 110-00 , adding that the market has not seen the type of profit-taking that usually follows a sharp rally . 
&quot; The market just hasn &apos;t seen profit-taking , which is a good sign , &quot; one bond futures trader said . 
&quot; Given everything we &apos;ve seen in the last few months , it &apos;s acting well , &quot; he said , adding that June T-bonds could test the two-month high of 110-14 / 32 in the near term . 
on Wednesday , preliminary first-quarter productivity data and March wholesale inventory data will be released . 
in the afternoon , the Federal Reserve &apos;s Beige Book is scheduled for release . 
at the close , June T-bonds were up 2 / 32 at 110-03 / 32 , 10-year notes were flat at 107-09 / 32 , muni-bonds rose 5 / 32 to 115-09 / 32 , September T-bills fell 0.005 BP to 94.465 , Eurodollars lost 0.015 to 93.870 .
