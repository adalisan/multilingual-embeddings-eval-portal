the European particle Physics Laboratory ( CERN ) announced on Friday it would aim to commission its major &quot; dawn of time project &quot; in 2005 , three years earlier than last scheduled . 
the decision was taken at a meeting of CERN &apos;s ruling Council grouping representatives of the 19 member countries of the body , which is at the leading edge of world research into the origins of the universe . 
the Council , a statement from CERN said , agreed that the Large Hardon Collider ( LHC ) particle accelerator which is at the heart of the project would be completed in one stage rather than two as had been decided two years ago . 
the LHC will fire proton beams around a 27-km ( 16.8-mile ) tunnel and smash them together to recreate conditions one millionth of a millionth of a second after the &quot; Big Bang &quot; that created the universe . 
after the cancellation in 1993 of a similar ambitious project in Texas , the LHC will be the world &apos;s largest atom smasher . 
the decision to bring commissioning forward followed the receipt over the past year of pledges of financial support for the project from non-member countries of CERN , including the United States , Canada , Japan , India and Russia . 
&quot; This is a very major step forward for CERN , European science , and world particle physics , &quot; said Laboratory Director-General Christopher Llewellyn-Smith , a British physicist . 
CERN , founded in 1954 , straddles the Swiss-French border on the outskirts of Geneva .
