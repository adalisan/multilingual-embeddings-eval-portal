tension over European economic and monetary union ( EMU ) will be high on financial markets &apos; agenda in the coming week , jockeying for position with U.S. data , analysts said on Friday . 
as the dispute between the Bundesbank and the German government over plans to revalue gold reserves remains unresolved , EU finance ministers meet in Luxembourg from Sunday . 
analysts said there are concerns that a softening of Maastricht criteria , or a watering down of the stability pact may result , particularly as the new French government has indicated it may wish to reopen discussions . 
&quot; I &apos;m amazed how well markets have stood up to the negative news flow -- the French elections , and the gold row , &quot; said Huw Roberts , European bond strategist at NatWest Markets in London . 
&quot; Further indications that there will be a soft European central bank run by politicians will be bad news , particularly for Bunds . 
Germany &apos;s Bundesbank council meets on Thursday , and Buba &apos;s deputy president Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said the gold issue would be discussed . 
analysts said the European calendar is dominated by a slew of UK data releases , most of which are expected to be relatively benign . 
since the Bank of England moved to raise interest rates a quarter point on Friday , any building inflation has been pre-empted . 
April UK industrial production and manufacturing output , as well as May producer prices , are due on Monday , but analysts said Wednesday &apos;s employment and wage data are the major focus . 
a Reuters poll forecast April average earnings steady at 4.5 percent , while unit wage costs are expected to have grown 2.5 percent in April , down from 2.6 percent the previous month . 
&quot; We are highlighting average earnings data , which we expect to rise to 4.75 percent , along with a chunky fall in unemployment , &quot; said Simon Knapp , international economist at BZW . 
&quot; These will be further signs that the domestic economy is very strong now . 
analysts said the slew of economic data would take the emphasis off the July 2 budget -- the first from a Labour government since 1979 . 
elsewhere in Europe , German May wholesale prices are due towards the end of the week . 
the forecast was for a rise of 0.3 percent on the month , to give a year-on-year forecast of 1.6 percent . 
in the U.S. , all data will be viewed in the light of what the Federal Open Market Committee might decide on interest rates at its early July meeting . 
Ian Morris , international economist at HSBC-James Capel said the focus in the U.S. would be on the May retail sales figures , scheduled for release on Thursday . 
&quot; The emphasis is on the consumer side , since consumer confidence is at a 28-year high , &quot; he said . 
&quot; A pullback in retail sales would take the sting out , and might make treasuries more comfortable . 
U.S. May producer prices were on the cards for Friday . 
Japanese GDP data for the first quarter may be released on Friday , as markets continue to watch for signs of any interest rate rise . 
economic Planning Agency vice minister Shimpei Nukaya said growth in GDP was expected to exceed the government &apos;s target of 2.5 percent .
