brisk demand for U.S. high-yield issues on Monday should be a harbinger for more of the same the rest of this week , with even more aggressive pricings sure to come , dealers said . 
Monday &apos;s issue of Comcast cellular Holdings Inc &apos;s $ 1.0 billion 10-year 9-1 / 2 percent senior note deal reflected the positive buying environment , trading up in early Tuesday trade . 
the deal , which was well-oversubscribed , was also increased in size by $ 100 million . 
trade in the Comcast notes was extremely active , traders said , recently quoted at par bid , 101-1 / 2 offer . 
&quot; New issues are still trading very strong , &quot; one junk bond trader said . 
&quot; Accounts are flush with cash , still being somewhat selective , but so far we &apos;ve seen only moderate supply and things have been firm . 
high-yield issues slated to price on Tuesday include Colorado Prime Corp &apos;s $ 100 million 10-year 144A senior notes via a J.P. Morgan Securities group . 
the issue will be priced around 12 percent with warrants , a source said . 
also , GST Telecom Inc &apos;s $ 230 million 10-year 144A senior secured three-year prefunded notes may be issued as early as Tuesday via Morgan Stanley &amp; Co . 
high-grade issuance has been slow to build despite talk of &quot; adequate &quot; investor demand . 
but two large issues , $ 800 million in five- and 10-year debt from dominion Resources Inc unit DR Investment and $ 300 million 10-year debt from Mellon Bank Corp , are expected to price on Tuesday , according to sources close to the deals . 
Mellon &apos;s deal , with price talk at 67 to 70 basis points off the Treasury curve , was said to be issue bid in early Tuesday dealings . 
the deal will price through lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston . 
beyond this week , however , dealers and investors are zoned in on the second wave of big railroad debt , Norfolk Southern Corp &apos;s $ 3.0 billion multi-tranche deal . 
Multi-notch downgrades of Norfolk Southern debt by both Moody &apos;s Investors Servoce and Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s were expected , said syndicate sources , who did not not immediately expect any downgrades to hinder the deal . 
Moody &apos;s cut Norfolk Southern &apos;s senior unsecured debt rating to Baa1 from A1 . 
the issue is expected to price through lead manager Merrill Lynch &amp; Co Inc next week .
