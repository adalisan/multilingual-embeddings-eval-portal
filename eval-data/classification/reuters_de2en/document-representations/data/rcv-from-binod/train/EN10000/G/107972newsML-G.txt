a medical task force headed to Colombia &apos;s Caribbean coast Thursday to investigate an outbreak of a virus nicknamed the &quot; Duck hug &quot; following at least 20 deaths in the region , Health Ministry officials said . 
at least 20 old people and children have died in the port city of Barranquilla and the provinces of Sucre and Bolivar from infections similar to those caused by the virus , though officials could not say if the virus was responsible . 
the virus , which causes breathing difficulties , severe flu-like aches and coughing , appears to be caused by weather and temperature changes but has not been fully identified . 
&quot; The illness is cyclical and reappears about every two years . 
the origin of the epidemic is unknown and the virus has not yet been identified , &quot; said Dr. Rodrigo Restrepo , of the Atlantic Coast Health Department . 
&quot; We cannot say whether it caused these 20 deaths or not . 
we &apos;re still investigating . 
the &quot; Duck hug &quot; virus is named after a dance of the same name , which is popular on the Caribbean coast and involves the man holding his partner so close that it almost cuts off her breath . 
a ministry spokesman said top epidemiologists had been sent to Barranquilla .
