the recent fall in Malawi &apos;s foreign exchange reserves is expected to be halted by the start of tobacco sales in April , a central bank official said on Wednesday . 
foreign reserves stood at $ 267.1 million in September 1996 from $ 129.9 million the previous year , but have fallen to $ 199.3 million in February this year -- according to the latest statistics available . 
Malawi &apos;s central bank General Manager for Economic Services , Ian Bonongwe said reserves had been affected earlier this year by speculation that the national currency , the kwacha , was to be devalued . 
the kwacha was trading at 15.210 kwacha to the dollar on Wednesday . 
&quot; There was strong speculation of a possible depreciation of the kwacha . 
so there was panic buying of foreign exchange , &quot; Bonongwe told Reuters . 
but Bonongwe said reserves should now increase with foreign exchange coming into the country from the sale of tobacco -- the country &apos;s biggest foreign currency earner . 
&quot; With the start of the tobacco season investors know there will be an increased inflow of foreign exchange , &quot; Bonongwe said , adding that speculation around the kwacha had ended . 
tobacco sales last year generated 4.2 billion kwacha ( $ 280 million ) , which represents more than 60 percent of the country &apos;s 6.7 billion kwacha total projected exports . 
total volume tobacco sales by March 1997 from last year &apos;s crop was 142,000 tonnes , compared to 130,000 tonnes for the same period in 1995 . 
around 159,000 tonnes of tobacco leaf are expected to be sold this year . 
the number of tobacco farmers in Malawi is also growing and reached 9,865 this year , compared to 5,559 in 1996 and 3,000 in 1995 . 
tobacco estates also grew to 49,000 in 1997 compared to 40,000 in 1966 . 
&quot; More and more people are growing tobacco because it has been liberalised , &quot; General Manager for Tobacco Control commission Godfrey Chapola said .
