U.S. debt futures were higher as retail and funds continued their buying spree from Thursday due to Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s comments , traders and analysts said . 
&quot; Greenspan &apos;s comments have been interpreted in fashion not in line with the highest probability of a Fed tightening , &quot; Rick Santelli , vice president of futures trading at Rand Financial Services , said . 
June T-bonds rallied to 110-09 / 32 , near the overnight high and last Friday &apos;s pit high of 110-10 / 32 , on active buying from retail firms as well as hedge funds , they said . 
selling by one Swiss bank at the opening vanished on the positive interpretation of Greenspan &apos;s string of comments in a speech to the New York University &apos;s Stern School of Business . 
while Greenspan said the Federal Reserve would need to act if growth fails to slow as expected , he also said he saw scant signs now of an imminent resurgence of inflation . 
&quot; The perception is that a rate hike is still a possibility , but if it happens it will be the last one , &quot; one Eurodollar futures trader said . 
he said December Eurodollars were still pricing in one more tightening . 
the contract will price out another rate hike if it climbs through the 94.00 level . 
medium-term resistance is at the two-month high of 93.84 . 
several traders noted that Greenspan also sounded defensive during his speech in which he discussed the March 25 rate hike . 
&quot; Greenspan sounded almost apologetic for raising rates , &quot; one Eurodollar futures floor source said . 
Greenspan defended the March 25 rate hike against what he called &quot; more than the usual share of ... criticism , &quot; and said the Fed raised rates as &quot; a form of insurance . 
traders said a new wave of buying would develop in T-bonds once June cracked the 110-10 / 32 level . 
most noted the bullish implications of the surge in open interest for bond futures during Thursday &apos;s slow grind higher . 
according to preliminary estimates , total open interest rose more than 26,000 to 590,306 . 
if preliminary estimates are correct , Thursday &apos;s open interest will be at a record high . 
&quot; Open interest alone is telling you that this market will go higher , &quot; one bond futures trader said . 
he is looking for June to rise to 111-00 to 111-16 / 32 in the intermediate term . 
as long as June bonds close above 109-24 / 32 on Friday , the June T-bonds will continue to rise , Santelli said . 
he pegged long-term resistance at 112-06 / 32 , which is currently equivalent to a long bond yield of 6.75 percent . 
at 0851 CDT / 1351 GMT , June T-bonds were up 13 / 32 at 110-07 / 32 , 10-year notes were 13 / 32 higher at 107-15 / 32 , September T-bills were up 0.075 at 94.51 , September Eurodollars were 0.08 higher at 93.925 and December Eurodollars were up 0.1 at 93.725 .
