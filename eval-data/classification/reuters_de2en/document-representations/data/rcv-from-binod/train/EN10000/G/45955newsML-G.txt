Russia on Wednesday welcomed U.N. approval of a treaty banning nuclear tests around the world as an important step towards creating a nuclear-free world . 
a foreign ministry statement said Moscow hoped all United Nations member states would back the document , which the General Assembly approved by 158 votes to three on Tuesday . 
dissenting countries were India , Libya and Bhutan . 
&quot; We welcome the approval of ... the draft treaty as a practical implementation of the proposal put forward by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of the United Nations in a fitting way , &quot; the ministry said . 
&quot; We hope that this treaty will receive support from all U.N. member states and will be an important contribution to the ever-advancing process of moving towards a non-nuclear world . 
Russia is one of the world &apos;s five declared nuclear powers along with the United States , China , France and Britain . 
all five have already ended nuclear tests unilaterally . 
India , one of the 44 nations which must ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) for it to enter into force , says the treaty does not go far enough in spelling out a timetable for global nuclear disarmament . 
it also says it fears threats from neighbouring China and Pakistan .
