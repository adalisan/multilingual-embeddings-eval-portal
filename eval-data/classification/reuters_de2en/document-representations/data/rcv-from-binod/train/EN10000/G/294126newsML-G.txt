Federal prosecutors on Wednesday were considering whether to appeal a judge &apos;s decision to free a former tobacco executive rather than send him back to Hong Kong where he would likely face trial under Chinese laws . 
U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Tauro ruled on Tuesday that the 20-year-old U.S. treaty with Britain governing extradition to Hong Kong does not extend to China . 
therefore lui Kin-Hong , acccused of taking bribes from cigarette smugglers , should be set free in 10 days , he said . 
&quot; China is the only sovereign that will be able to try and punish lui , &quot; Tauro said in his 31-page opinion . 
the decision , which cited U.S. Senate debate on the treaty in the mid-1970s and in 1986 , could throw into jeopardy the U.S. extradition treaty for Hong Kong . 
&quot; The Senate &apos;s ratification was clearly premised on its trust in the judicial and penal system of the United Kingdom ... 
it is clear beyond rational dispute that the Senate would not have ratified had there been any suggestion that the treaty could be extended , even by circumstance , to China , &quot; the judge wrote . 
lui , who also goes by the name Jerry lui , had been held in a Massachusetts state prison since his capture at Boston &apos;s Logan Airport in December 1995 , when he flew to the city to visit a sick friend . 
prosecutors had argued the extradition treaty between the United States and Hong Kong remained in effect at least until July 1 , when the British colony is scheduled to be handed over to China . 
no decision on an appeal would be made on Wednesday , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney &apos;s Office in Boston said . 
&quot; We &apos;re reviewing ( the decision ) with the Department of Justice in Washington , &quot; she told Reuters . 
Hong Kong officials claimed lui , a former commercial director of British-American Tobacco Company ( Hong Kong ) Ltd ( BAT ) , accepted more than $ 3 million in cash bribes and $ 1.5 million in unsecured loans to help export companies smuggle cigarettes into China . 
lui &apos;s lawyer Harvey Silverglate said he had filed with the U.S. court a &quot; voluminous &quot; amount of documents maintaining lui &apos;s innocence . 
he also submitted State Department reports on China and an affidavit from Harvard Law School professor William Alford that said lui might have faced a quick death if he was extradited to Hong Kong . 
the smuggling of foreign cigarettes into China costs the country around $ 1 billion a year in lost revenues and is considered a &quot; crime of counter-revolution , &quot; Silverglate said . 
&quot; The chances are very good that he would have been subject to capital punishment , &quot; he said . 
he said he expected lui to be released on bail next week and to remain in Boston to fight an expected appeal by U.S. prosecutors . 
lui and his wife , who have two young children , became Canadian citizens in 1994 and own a home in Toronto . 
he is a partner in an exporting business in the Philippines .
