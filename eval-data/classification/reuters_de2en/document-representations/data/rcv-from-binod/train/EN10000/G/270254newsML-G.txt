Greece said on Friday it had ordered home its ambassador to Peru , who was freed by leftist rebels to negotiate the release of about 400 captives held in the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence . 
Ambassador Alcibiadis Karokis was released along with the ambassadors of Canada , Germany and a Peruvian diplomat by the Cuban-inspired guerrillas . 
the guerrillas , who stormed the residence on Tuesday , freed the diplomats after they agreed to act as negotiators with the Peruvian government . 
&quot; We had communicated to the ambassador while he was in the residence that he should find a way to escape and come home , &quot; government spokesman Dimitris Reppas told a news briefing . 
asked by a Greek reporter why the diplomat had abandoned his colleagues &quot; and run for it , &quot; Reppas said the government backed its ambassador because he had followed orders to escape . 
negotiators , including Canadian ambassador Anthony Vincent and a Red Cross official , began talks on Thursday with the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) guerrillas . 
the guerrillas have threatened to kill their captives unless the Peruvian government releases 400 to 500 jailed comrades . 
the hostages include diplomats , businessmen and state officials . 
&quot; There is no legal procedure in cases like this , &quot; Reppas said , adding that Karokis and his family were on their way home .
