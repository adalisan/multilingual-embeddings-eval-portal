the dollar ended lower against most major currencies Monday after Saturday &apos;s meeting of global economic officials ended with a veiled threat to halt the dollar &apos;s rally if it continued unchecked , traders said . 
but after an initial spate of panic selling , the dollar gradually trimmed its losses as bargain-hunters emerged and investors re-examined the statements from the Group of Seven industrialised nations meeting in Berlin . 
the official G7 communique stated that currency market &quot; misalignments &quot; had been corrected and labelled excess volatility &quot; undesirable . 
&quot; The group also pledged cooperation to ensure currency markets follow economic fundamentals . 
market players at first interpreted those statements as a call for an end to the dollar &apos;s sharp gains of recent weeks . 
&quot; The communique basically stated that the G7 will intervene if the dollar accelerates too quickly or too high , &quot; said Vincent Amaru , a vice president at Citibank . 
&quot; It would be smart not to test the central banks right away . 
in Far East trading , the dollar quickly fell toward 120 Japanese yen from 123.13 late Friday and to 1.64 German marks from 1.6610 . 
but by the end of Monday trading , the dollar had rebounded to 122.76 yen and 1.6562 marks . 
the greenback followed similar patterns against other currencies , ending lower at 1.4260 Swiss francs versus 1.4295 late Friday . 
the British pound rose to $ 1.6407 from $ 1.6303 . 
dealers said the market had overreacted to the G7 statement , allowing investors to pick up dollars on the cheap . 
a host of comments from G7 leaders helped embolden dollar buyers , notably statements from influential Japanese Finance Ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara to a parliamentary committee in Tokyo . 
Sakakibara , director-general of the Finance Ministry &apos;s International Finance Bureau , highlighted the G7 desire for stability , not necessarily a reversal of dollar gains . 
&quot; They hit the dollar pretty hard in Sydney time , &quot; said Greg Perman , chief dealer at Credit Commerciale de France . 
&quot; But the G7 does not intend to drive the dollar back to 115 yen . 
they just intend to keep it at these levels . 
yet many dealers said they now see an inevitable confrontation between dollar bulls and monetary authorities in coming weeks . 
&quot; I think they will knock the dollar down again , &quot; said Perman . 
&quot; They are not going to let the rise be as rapid if it continues . 
if the dollar gets back toward 124 or 125 yen , people will be a little cautious . 
the dollar has soared more than 50 percent from a post-World War II low against the yen in early 1995 , and more than 7 percent in 1997 alone . 
should G7 officials opt to sell dollars for yen , dealers expect the initial reaction would be a sharp dollar decline below 120 and possibly further . 
&quot; The Bank of Japan has such huge dollar reserves that if they ever wanted to hold it down , they could , &quot; Perman said .
