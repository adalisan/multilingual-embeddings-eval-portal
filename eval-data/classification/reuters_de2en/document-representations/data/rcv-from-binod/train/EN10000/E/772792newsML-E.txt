Turkish bankers and economists have predicted that the July inflation will be higher than the figures for the same 1996 month due to mid-month petroleum price rises and revised 1997 annual inflation , according to a poll on Friday . 
the Reuters poll , based on estimates from nine banks , eight brokerage houses and two economists , has shown that July consumer prices were expected to be around 4.8-5.5 percent and wholesale prices 5.5-6.0 percent . 
the rise in consumer prices was 2.1 percent and that in wholesale prices was 2.4 percent in July 1996 . 
the new coalition government formed at end-June raised petroleum prices by up to 32 percent on July 14 , raising concerns in financial markets that inflation would soar in the second half of 1997 . 
higher inflation fears were also fuelled by forecasts by officials that ranged from 80 to 100 percent for the end-year inflation . 
prior to the price hikes , the market had been expecting the July figure to be around 2.8-3.8 percent rise in consumer prices and 3.0-4.5 percent rise in wholesale prices . 
bankers have also revised their annual inflation estimates up by 10 points to over 90 percent from the 80-85 percent target last month . 
economists predict that the petroleum price rises will be reflected in August prices data . 
&quot; In line with the monetary programme , we may see a monetary discipline by the end of this year . 
if we see progress on this , we can lower our annual inflation targets to 87-93 percent from 95 percent levels , &quot; said a private bank economist . 
the Turkish treasury and central bank signed on Wednesday an agreement to cooperate in fighting inflation and keeping it below 90 percent levels . 
State minister Gunes Taner said last week the annual inflation might go up to 100 percent levels , compared to the current level of just under 80 percent .
