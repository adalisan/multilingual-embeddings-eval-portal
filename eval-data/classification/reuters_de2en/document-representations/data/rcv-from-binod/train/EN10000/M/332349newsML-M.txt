Malaysian shares closed higher on institutional fund buying , inspite of weak international markets and the announcement of trade deficit data which had been discounted , said analysts and traders . 
at the close , the benchmark composite Index of 100 large-capitalised stocks closed up 2.26 points to 1,244.13 , but off its high of 1,245.69 . 
the small-capitalised Second Board index was up 8.18 to 622.72 . 
&quot; Institutional investors were back in the market , and there were some decent-sized orders , even though there was some profit taking , &quot; said Tony Shue , a dealer at Jupiter Securities . 
&quot; I was surprised by how resilient the ( Kuala Lumpur ) market was to the weakness on the international markets , &quot; said John Engle , managing director of brokers H.G. 
Asia in Kuala Lumpur . 
&quot; The selling here was not representative of the trade figures or the economy , as it looks as if the trade deficit for the full year will be around half the government &apos;s own estimate , &quot; Engle said . 
banking and finance issues were among the most actively-traded stocks . 
Rashid Hussain was up one ringgit to 20.30 ringgit , DCB Holdings was up 35 cents to 9.95 and Arab Malaysian Merchant Bank was up 80 to 22.20 .
