President Boris Yeltsin , a week into his recovery from heart surgery , discussed Russia &apos;s defence problems with his prime minister on Tuesday as the demoralised military stepped up their fight for more money . 
Yeltsin , gradually resuming his activities in the Central Clinical Hospital , was briefed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in a telephone call on progress in paying delayed salaries to the army and security forces . 
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin &apos;s recovery was going well but doctors still wanted him to &quot; make haste slowly &quot; . 
he told a briefing that no date had yet been set for Yeltsin to record a television or radio address . 
Yeltsin spoke by telephone on Tuesday with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , who advised him not to force the pace of his return to work , and renewed an invitation to the 65-year-old Kremlin chief to convalesce in Germany . 
Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin , who underwent a quintuple heart bypass operation on November 5 , told Kohl he needed time to think over the invitation . 
delays in paying army wages have caused serious discontent since Yeltsin &apos;s re-election in July as the government has struggled to meet its payments obligations against a background of low tax receipts . 
defence Minister Igor Rodionov on Tuesday warned the Russian leadership publicly that Russia faced a catastrophe unless it took urgent steps to reform the army . 
&quot; The armed forces today have come to the point where a further reduction in their combat readiness could lead to unforeseeable , tragic consequences , &quot; Rodionov told a meeting of the military top brass in Moscow . 
&quot; If extreme measures are not taken to reform the army in the near future , the consequences for the state could be catastrophic . 
Yeltsin has ordered a switch to a smaller professional army by the year 2000 , a target widely seen as unrealistic unless more funds are made available . 
Rodionov &apos;s gloomy message increased the pressure on the government to meet its spending obligations while simultaneously trying to boost its tax revenues to satisfy the International Monetary Fund . 
finance Minister Alexander Livshits said on Tuesday that talks with the International Monetary Fund on paying out a new tranche of Russia &apos;s 10 billion loan were difficult . 
&quot; The results of the talks will be clear in about 10 days . 
the talks are definitely difficult . 
definitely difficult , &quot; Livshits told reporters . 
&quot; They are showing us shortcomings in the fulfilment of our promises for the entire programme and are asking us whether these are incorrect . 
they are correct . 
an IMF mission left Moscow last month after regular monitoring of Russia &apos;s economic performance but postponed a decision on whether the tranche should be paid out , saying that poor tax collection was threatening fiscal policy . 
Russian officials say only 74 percent of budgeted revenues were collected in the first nine months of this year . 
spending has been screwed back drastically , so many public sector workers are not being paid on time . 
an advance group of IMF experts has already started examining tax revenue data and the full mission is due to return later this week . 
Livshits said revenues were coming in at a much faster rate this month than in October , when the authorities , stung by the IMF crisis , announced a crackdown on big corporate tax debtors . 
Chernomyrdin &apos;s government is also facing an uphill battle to get its 1997 budget passed by the State Duma , where the Communist Party and its allies control most of the seats . 
Interfax news agency quoted Duma budget committee chairman Mikhail Zadornov on Tuesday as dashing hopes for the passage of the budget before the end of the year .
