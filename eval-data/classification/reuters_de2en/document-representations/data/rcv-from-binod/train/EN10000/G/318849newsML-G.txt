black activist Rev. 
Al Sharpton , evoking the legacy of the late Dr. Martin Luther King , Monday officially declared himself a candidate for the Democratic nomination for mayor . 
Sharpton , often found in the midst of controversial causes and campaigns , accused heavily favoured incumbent Republican Rudolph Giuliani of polarising the city , tolerating police brutality and cutting back on education and job creation . 
&quot; We need to end this century by deciding which way New York is going , &quot; the flamboyant minister told supporters in a speech in Harlem that started with rousing chants of &quot; No Justice , No Peace &quot; and ended with gospel music . 
&quot; Will we continue the progressive road where people have power and say-so over their destiny or ... a road where we &apos;re controlled by the business barons and the real estate barons in an almost-police state ? 
&quot; he asked . 
making his official announcement speech on the federal holiday honouring King , Sharpton painted himself as following in the footsteps of the slain civil rights leader . 
&quot; I &apos;m a continuation of the dream of the people that marched in Selma and Birmingham , &quot; he said . 
&quot; History beckons . 
Sharpton has fared poorly in opinion polls that put Giuliani far ahead of all his potential rivals in the mayoral election in November . 
but the only declared black candidate is seen as possibly drawing support away from other likely candidates such as Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger . 
Brooklyn City Councilman Sal Albanese was first to join the race , and bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer also is likely to run . 
Sharpton has made a name for himself in local civil rights causes such as the 1986 death in Howard Beach , Queens , of a black teen chased by white youths and the 1991 deaths in Crown Heights , Brooklyn , of a black child and a Jewish scholar . 
Sharpton made an unexpectedly strong showing in 1992 in losing a four-way Democratic Senate primary , finishing ahead of former City Controller Elizabeth Holtzman . 
he also ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic Senate nomination in 1994 . 
recent polls show a majority of New Yorkers are satisfied with the quality of life in the city , which is enjoying the lowest crime rate in a generation . 
but Sharpton said credit for less crime should go to civic and community groups , not to Giuliani , a former prosecutor who was elected in 1993 . 
&quot; The reason he &apos;s getting away with fraud , political fraud , is he &apos;s had a three-year monologue , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But as of this day , the monologue is over . 
Shaprton called for a requirement that police officers live in New York City -- a proposal that is immensely unpopular among members of the police department and would need approval by the state legislature . 
he also called for racial sensitivity testing of police officers and teachers . 
he also challenged Democratic primary rules that require a run-off between the top two candidates if no one wins 40 percent . 
Sharpton wants a winner-take-all primary election .
