Kuwait said on Saturday it would soon restore ties with some Arab countries which sided with Iraq during its 1990 invasion of Kuwait , the the official news agency KUNA reported . 
&quot; Kuwait will soon restore ties with some Arab states that took positions supportive of the Iraqi regime during Iraq &apos;s invasion of Kuwait more than seven years ago , &quot; acting prime minister and foreign minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah said after a parliament meeting . 
&quot; I have more than once said that this will take place soon ... and that we have to remove the word &apos; opponent &apos; ( countries ) &quot; , he told reporters . 
Sheikh Sabah declined to set a date but said the parliament &apos;s closed session had discussed the issue , KUNA quoted him as saying . 
Jordan , Yemen , Libya , Sudan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) supported Iraq during the 1990-1991 Gulf War . 
last month Sheikh Sabah said Kuwait hoped to improve ties with all Arab states except an Iraq ruled by Saddam Hussein -- whose forces occupied Kuwait for seven months from August 1990 . 
his remarks came after a poll showed that prominent Kuwaitis supported normal ties with Gulf crisis foes Jordan and Yemen but rejected dealing with Sudan and the PLO .
