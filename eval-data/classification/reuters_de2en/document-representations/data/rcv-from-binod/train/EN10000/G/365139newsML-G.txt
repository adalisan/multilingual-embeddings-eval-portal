Sampdoria owner Enrico Mantovani said on Saturday that his Italian serie A club had a replacement for Swedish coach Sven-Goran Eriksson lined up already for next season but refused to name him . 
Eriksson , whose team are now second , two points behind Juventus in serie A , has committed himself to moving to English premier league club Blackburn Rovers next season . 
Mantovani told La Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper in an interview that a successor was ready but he could give no details because it would be too easy to identify him . 
the paper said the frontrunners were believed to be Uruguayan former Milan coach Oscar Washington Tabarez , who was replaced by Arrigo Sacchi late last year , and Napoli &apos;s Luigi Simoni , who started off as a coach at Genoa .
