Members of the Papua New Guinea parliament were warned on Tuesday to stay inside parliament house minutes after voting down a motion in favour of embattled Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan . 
a public announcement in the building said cars outside were being stoned . 
a Reuters correspondent outside said a group of soldiers , some of them armed , arrived a few minutes after the vote but were sitting peacefully outside parliament gates . 
after five hours of debate , MPs voted by 58 to 39 against a motion which called on Chan and two close aides to stand aside while an inquiry was held into a decision to use mercenaries against an uprising on Bougainville island . 
only five minutes later , there was an announcement on the parliament &apos;s public address system warning of violence outside the building . 
&quot; This is a security announcement to all parliament house occupants , &quot; it said . 
&quot; You will not be allowed to leave parliament because cars are being stoned . 
another Reuters correspondent said some cars had been stoned in an apparently minor incident at the back entrance to the building , but there was no sign of serious trouble .
