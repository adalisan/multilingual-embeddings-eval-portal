Indonesia &apos;s rupiah briefly fell against the dollar in late trading on Friday on news several churches in East Java were burned by a mob , dealers said . 
police said five people died after being trapped in a burning church when a rampaging crowd destroyed nine churches and a number of Christian schools in Situbondo , east Java . 
a policeman in Situbondo , 800 km east of Jakarta on Java island , told Reuters by telephone that the crowd also destroyed a court building during the violence on Thursday . 
spot rupiah fell briefly to a low of 2,323.25 in the afternoon before it settled around 2,320.5 / 21.0 at 0845 GMT . 
it opened at 2,321.0 / 21.5 . 
today closed at 2,317.0 / 17.5 . 
one economist in Hong Kong said offshore operators had made a knee-jerk reaction to the news . 
&quot; They immediately sold the rupiah . 
people could not assess the situation because it happened in a small town , &quot; he said . 
he said the only direction the dollar could head in such a situation was up . 
however , dealers said sentiment recovered very quickly , helping the rupiah to recover to its earlier trading level . 
they said confidence seemed to have returned as the riots were localised and were not spreading to other cities .
