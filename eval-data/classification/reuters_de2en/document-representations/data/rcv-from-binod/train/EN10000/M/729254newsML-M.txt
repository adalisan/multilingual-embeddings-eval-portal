the foreign crude scene on the U.S. Gulf Coast began to shift toward September on Tuesday , although August business was still in full swing , traders said . 
among the first September offerings heard was a Nigerian bonny Light for September 2-7 arrival , with an asking price of dated Brent plus $ 2.00 a barrel on a CIF basis , traders said . 
West African cargoes have proved scarce in the Gulf in recent weeks in the wake of heavy Far East buying . 
End-August Brent was still on offer around 25-30 cents a barrel under West Texas Intermediate / Cushing , traders said . 
in Latin America , the market was still riveted by the shutdown of Cano Limon operations in Colombia . 
on Tuesday , operator Occidental Petroleum declared force majeure on the 180,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) oil field , the first time ever that Oxy has taken this step in the country . 
Colombian state oil company Ecopetrol has had force majeure on liftings in place since July 6 after a string of rebel bombings of the 250,000-300,000 bpd Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline . 
several cargoes have been affected , with delays of at least one week anticipated . 
meanwhile , rebel attacks persisted , with another attack on Tuesday morning . 
finally , equity producer British Petroleum sold a Cusiana cargo on Monday loading August 21-25 , traders said . 
the price was heard around 70-80 cents a barrel under October WTI / Cushing . 
the September program for Cusiana was expected to be released late next week . 
elsewhere in Latin America , Argentine YPF on Monday placed 950,000 barrels of Canadon Seco crude oil at $ 3.90 to $ 4.00 under October WTI / Cushing .
