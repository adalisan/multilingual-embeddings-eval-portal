former Wimbledon champion Michael Stich said on Friday he would retire from competitive tennis later this year because of a recurring shoulder injury . 
the 28-year-old German , who won Wimbledon in 1991 and stood at number two in the world rankings in 1994 , said he would play until September , when he hoped to bow out by playing for the German Davis Cup team against Mexico . 
&quot; The main reason for my decision is my physical condition , &quot; Stich said . 
Stich , plagued by injury , has slipped down the rankings over the last few years and is now 26th . 
he said the final straw came earlier this month when he lost in the first round of the Barcelona Open , winning only four games in a straight sets defeat by Gilbert Schaller of Austria . 
&quot; The defeat itself wasn &apos;t the problem , &quot; Stich said . 
Stich said he had problems reaching above shoulder height even in everyday life because of his injury , caused by a build-up of calcium in the shoulder area . 
the tall , cool Stich was a marked contrast to Germany &apos;s other male tennis star of the last decade -- the emotional and powerful Boris Becker . 
Stich was never able to step out of the shadow of Becker , his opponent in the 1991 Wimbledon final and his partner in the Olympic doubles the following year , when the pair won gold . 
together with Steffi Graf , Becker and Stich sparked a tennis boom in Germany , encouraging millions to play the game , or at least take a greater interest in it . 
&quot; This is a very sad piece of news for us , &quot; said Claus Stauder , the president of the German Tennis Federation . 
&quot; I had hoped that , of our three superstars , Michael would play on the longest . 
Stich won his first international tournament in Memphis in 1990 . 
he won the Grand Slam Cup in 1992 and was crowned ATP world champion in 1993 . 
a Davis Cup title in 1993 and an appearance in the final of the U.S. Open the following year also ranked among his major successes . 
Stich said he had not yet decided what to do after he gives up tennis but added he would remain involved with a charity he set up to help children infected with the HIV virus .
