two new call warrants on the Taiwan weighted Index were launched on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong on Wednesday , bolstering Hong Kong &apos;s status as a trading centre for regional products , the exchange said . 
stock Exchange chief executive Alec Tsui said the 1998 warrants , one issue by peregrine Derivatives Ltd and one issue by Union Bank of Switzerland , were the first such products launched in Hong Kong . 
&quot; The development of this new market in Hong Kong for listed investment products with a regional focus will help Hong Kong consolidate its position as the leading trading centre for regional products , &quot; Tsui said . 
Tsui said developing a regional derivatives market would provide more and better choice of hedging and investment vehicles to domestic and international investors . 
trading of call warrants on regional indices and of convertible bonds would be exempt from stamp duty , he said . 
financial Services Secretary Rafael Hui said the government was willing to favourably consider incentives for new products on a case-by-case basis . 
Hui said developing new products was essential , not just to maintain Hong Kong &apos;s competitiveness , but also to enhance its status as a regional and global financial centre . 
Tsui predicted more such listings as participants familiarised themselves with trading of regional derivatives . 
peregrine Derivatives said the warrants offered investors exposure to the Taiwan weighted Index . 
&quot; For every 1,000 warrants , you have the entitlement to buy one Taiwan ( weighted ) Index , &quot; peregrine Derivatives associate director Kevin Fung told Reuters . 
Tsui also said the stock exchange was also publishing a monthly report to provide the latest information on stock market developments to support the listing and trading of convertible bonds or derivative warrants on underlying securities . 
it would cover 15 stock markets -- Tokyo , Osaka , Korea , Shanghai , Shenzhen , Taiwan , the Philippines , Thailand , Malaysia , Singapore , Jakarta , Australia , New Zealand , Bombay and the National Stock Exchange of India , Tsui said .
