the number of trips across the Canadian border decreased in both directions , Statistics Canada said on Thursday . 
Canadians made 4.3 percent fewer same-day car trips into the United States compared with February , the biggest drop in two years . 
the total fell to 2.9 million from a November 1991 peak of 5.4 million when the Canadian dollar was worth 88 U.S. cents . 
it is now about 72.2 U.S. cents . 
Americans made 2.1 million car excursions into Canada in March , a 1.1 percent drop from February -- but about 50 percent higher than the most recent low of 1.4 million in January 1994 . 
all data is unadjusted . 
the number of cross-border car trips by Americans into Canada via two Niagara Falls bridges almost doubled from a year earlier , due mainly to the opening of a Canadian casino near the bridges . 
in March the number of trips of at least one night by foreigners to Canada was down 4.1 percent to 1.5 million , and Canadians made 4.4 percent fewer overnight trips to the United States than in February .
