Peru &apos;s national assembly is prepared to grant amnesty to the Marxist guerrillas occupying the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence in Lima , a Japanese newspaper reported on Thursday , quoting the assembly speaker . 
Assembly speaker Victor Joy Way told the Yomiuri Shimbun daily newspaper in an interview that parliament would give amnesty to rebels from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) in order to end the nine-day hostage crisis . 
the amnesty could cover the armed MRTA guerrillas who stormed the residence on December 17 and took hundreds of hostages , but would not apply to members of the group serving jail sentences , Way was quoted as saying . 
the measure would meet one of the guerrillas demands that the MRTA be legalised and allowed to join Lima &apos;s political process , the daily said . 
the Yomiuri identified the speaker as a close ally of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori , who has flatly rejected all the demands made by the guerrillas and has said they must release the captives and hand over their weapons . 
the MRTA released a sick Japanese diplomat on Wednesday , but still holds more than 100 hostages , including diplomats , Peru government officials and Japanese businessmen .
