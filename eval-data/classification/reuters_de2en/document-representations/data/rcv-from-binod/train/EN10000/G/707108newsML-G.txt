U.N. officials in Angola said on Friday the government had reported losing some territory in the diamond-rich northeast of the country to the former rebel movement UNITA . 
the spokesman for the U.N. &apos; s peacekeeping mission in Angola , David Wimhurst , told Reuters the Luanda government reported the loss of a town called Northeast Frontier Post , on the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo , to UNITA fighters . 
&quot; The government tells us that five police and some civilians were killed in fighting around that town , &quot; Wimhurst said , adding that the government had also reported seven people killed in fighting in two other villages in the area . 
there was no independent confirmation of the reports and a U.N. verification team would go to the area on Saturday , he added . 
UNITA officials dismissed the government report as propaganda aimed at allowing the national army to step up action against the former rebel movement in the northeast , where there has been heavy fighting in recent weeks . 
&quot; This is completely untrue . 
it is part of a propaganda campaign by the government . 
they are preparing the country for a return to war , &quot; UNITA spokesman Horacio Junjuvili told Reuters . 
the government launched an offensive into UNITA-held areas in the region in May , which it said was aimed at rooting out armed refugees from the former Zaire . 
but observers and Western diplomats said this was just a pretext for the Angolan army to recapture diamond territory controlled by UNITA . 
a peace agreement ended nearly two decades of civil war in November 1994 , but while the rival sides are members of a government of national unity , UNITA has refused to give up its 80 percent stake in Angola &apos;s diamond wealth . 
some analysts fear the country could return to full-scale fighting , but the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously on Monday to close its current peacekeeping operation and create an observer mission of 86 lighty-armed military officers and 345 civilian police . 
four thousand U.N. troops attached to the current mission , which began early in 1995 , will stage a phased withdrawal until November .
