PLO officials rejected on Wednesday a proposal by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to press to conclude &quot; final status &quot; peace talks within six months . 
an Israeli source in Jerusalem said Netanyahu had proposed the two sides bypass three planned Israeli troop withdrawals from the West Bank in order to accelerate talks on a final peace and seal a deal two years earlier than planned . 
PLO officials confirmed Netanyahu had made the proposal and denounced it as an attempt to scrap an existing interim peace accord . 
&quot; Netanyahu informed ( Jordanian ) King Hussein that he wants to jump over the interim period and move directly into permanent status talks . 
the Israeli source said Netanyahu made the proposal because a 1995 interim peace deal committing Israel to the three pullbacks in parallel with talks on the fate of the West Bank and Gaza , occupied by Israel in 1967 , &quot; created confrontations &quot; . 
Netanyahu &apos;s office declined comment . 
the proposal comes during a crisis in Israeli-PLO peace talks over Netanyahu &apos;s decision to start construction of a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem and over a planned West Bank troop withdrawal that fell short of Arafat &apos;s expectations . 
final status talks due to have begun this week were delayed because of the crisis . 
those talks -- slated to end by 1999 -- will tackle thorniest issues dividing Israel and the Palestinians , including borders , Jewish settlements , refugees and Jerusalem . 
chief PLO negotiator Saeb Erekat deonounced the proposal as a &quot; trick &quot; and insisted Israel stick to the original deal . 
&quot; It &apos;s a new trick from Netanyahu and an attempt to divert people &apos;s attention from the destruction of the peace process that is taking place by Israeli bulldozers on Jabal Abu Ghneim , &quot; Erekat told Reuters . 
Israel broke ground on Tuesday for 6,500 homes for Jews on Jabal Abu Ghneim , a pine-covered hill occupied in 1967 , prompting international condemnation and fears of violence . 
the hill is known as Har Homa in Hebrew . 
&quot; It will be bad faith on the part of the Israelis if they propose this . 
the peace process is based on parallelism , &quot; Erekat told Reuters . 
&quot; We tell Netanyahu there is no contradiction between going with permanent status negotiations and continuing with implementation of the outstanding commitments of the interim agreement , &quot; Erekat told Israel &apos;s Army radio .
