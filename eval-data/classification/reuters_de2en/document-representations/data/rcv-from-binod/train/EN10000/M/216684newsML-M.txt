White sugar futures clawed their way marginally higher on Tuesday afternoon after sustained light buying throughout the day , but the forwards structure remained flat with little attraction for spread dealings , traders said . 
the spot March contract saw a mixture of trade and commission house buying , mainly outright , which pushed values up to $ 305.10 at one point . 
traders continued to watch the fortunes of the raws market before it closes for a two-day holiday starting on Thursday , and said a good close by the March contract on Wednesday would be bullish for London . 
&quot; I can &apos;t see the ( London ) market sustaining these higher levels for too long , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; I would look for a small setback but if we do go above , and rest above 10.78 ( cents / lb ) basis March New York , it &apos;ll be a different kettle of fish . 
at 1724 GMT March was 80 cents higher at $ 304.50 and May was up 90 cents at $ 305.00 . 
August was the same value as May and October was a full $ 5.00 lower , although the contango seen earlier in the session was ironed back into a backwardation . 
Paris positions also climbed gently higher in an overall volume of 621 lots . 
March was up 70 cents at $ 304.40 and May up 30 cents at $ 304.80 .
