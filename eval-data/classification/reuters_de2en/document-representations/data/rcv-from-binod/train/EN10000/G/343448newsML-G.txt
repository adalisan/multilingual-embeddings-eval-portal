starvation threatens some 60,000 people sleeping in the open in southern Madagascar after their homes were destroyed or damaged by Cyclone Gretelle , state radio said on Thursday . 
travellers arriving in the capital from the southern tip of the island , where Gretelle swept ashore last Friday night , said many people were still cut off by floodwaters . 
&quot; starvation above all threatens the victims , &quot; said the radio , adding an estimated 60,000 were homeless . 
officials meanwhile said that interim President Norbert Ratsirahonana , who arrived in the south on Wednesday , was ready to do everything possible to ensure food and other aid arrived urgently . 
the government relief effort is supported by various foreign countries and international organisations . 
the French military has sent in a Transall transport plane carrying doctors and rescue workers and a helicopter from their base on the nearby island of Reunion . 
an initial report by the ministry of foreign affairs put the provisional toll from Cyclone Gretelle at 13 people dead and 100 missing . 
the government has declared all of the south a disaster zone . 
packing winds of up to 250 km ( 155 miles per hour ) , the cyclone left all 27,500 residents of Farafangana town without shelter and was the worst to hit Madagascar in living memory . 
the storm wreaked havoc in a rich farming zone on the world &apos;s fourth largest island producing coffee , bananas , oranges and lychees . 
the first planeload of aid reached the south on Sunday . 
convoys of trucks ferrying food , medicine and building materials found it hard to reach the worst-hit areas because roads were blocked in many places by floods and fallen trees . 
many villagers survived by clinging to trees to avoid being blown away . 
others escaped being swept away by raging floodwaters by taking to the roofs of buildings . 
radio Madagascar has criticised the slow pace of the rescue effort . 
some residents said the radio itself failed to forecast accurately the force with which the cyclone would batter the island . 
Gretelle was the seventh tropical storm to hit the former French colony since the start of the cyclone season in October .
