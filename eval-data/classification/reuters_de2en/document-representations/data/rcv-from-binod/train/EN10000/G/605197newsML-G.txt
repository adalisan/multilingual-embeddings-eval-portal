Guyanese electoral officials said on Wednesday they were preparing for early parliamentary polls , probably in October this year . 
Guyana &apos;s next national elections are not due until March next year but the sudden death of President Cheddi Jagan two months ago has hastened the electoral process , officials said . 
chief Election Officer Stanley Singh told Reuters plans for an election in early October were well advanced and that he would present interim President Samuel Hinds with a final report on Aug . 23 . 
Jagan &apos;s death at age 78 from heart disease swelled public support for his People &apos;s Progressive Party / Civic ( PPP / Civic ) alliance that won Guyana &apos;s first democratic elections for 28 years in October 1992 . 
reflecting the wave of public sympathy following his death , Jagan &apos;s widow , Janet Jagan , was named prime minister and is widely tipped to lead the PPP / Civic alliance at the next elections . 
her opponent would most likely be the People &apos;s National Congress ( PNC ) party &apos;s Desmond Hoyte , who proceeded Jagan in the presidency .
