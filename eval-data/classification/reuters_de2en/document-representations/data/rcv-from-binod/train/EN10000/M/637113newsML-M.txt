CBOT wheat futures fell to three-month lows on Wednesday , hit by limit losses in soybeans and by harvest progress in the U.S. Plains , traders said . 
&quot; It was a bean-dominated trade for corn and wheat , &quot; said Tom Levis , grains analyst with prudential Securities in Chicago . 
&quot; The weather has improved here for harvest of hard red winter wheat but really there &apos;s just not a lot going on that &apos;s new . 
soybeans tumbled the 30-cent per bushel limit , hammered by news Cargill Inc was importing Brazilian soybeans for use in southeastern U.S. processing plants . 
harvest progress in Texas was also cited as a bearish factor . 
combines were in the fields as far north as Fort worth , Texas . 
one cash grain dealer said on Wednesday his firm had taken in 45 truckloads of new crop wheat earlier this week from around the Fort worth area . 
forecasts for a dry week in Oklahoma and Texas suggested harvest would continue at a rapid clip , traders said . 
the July traded as low as $ 3.52-1 / 2 per bushel , down 9-1 / 2 cents from the previous close and the lowest since February . 
wheat ended 8-1 / 4 to 4-1 / 4 cents per bushel lower with July down 8-1 / 4 at $ 3.53-3 / 4 . 
KCBT / CBOT spreads were also cited as a bearish factor , triggered by news Egypt had purchased hard red winter wheat instead of soft . 
technically , trade sources said the market continued to trade below the trend line and the July needed to break out above $ 3.62 a bushel to spur chart-based buying interest . 
and F. Man International each sold 2.5 million July while prudential Securities bought 1.5 million July , pit sources said . 
FIMAT futures and prudential each spread one million bushels September / July at 6-1 / 2 to seven cents , traders said . 
in options trade , Iowa grain bought 300 July $ 3.90 calls at 1-1 / 2 cents and Paine Webber sold 250 July $ 3.40 puts at 3-1 / 2 cents . 
wheat futures volume was estimated by CBOT at 16,000 contracts , above Tuesday &apos;s actual volume of 12,761 .
