most Hungarian shares closed steady or slightly lower in Wednesday but the BUX index still rose on oil and gas company MOL MOLB.BU ) and chemicals maker TVK ( TVKD.BU , which firmed in brisk trading , traders said . 
&quot; The market more or less stagnated , &quot; said Peter Lencs of MKB Securities . 
MOL , which has risen steadily since last Thursday when the government announced energy price hikes for 1997 , closed at 1,865 forints , up 30 , and dealers said they did not yet see the end of the bullish trend for MOL shares . 
London-based Nomura Research published a positive update about TVK recently , but dealers said the price was more likely to have been influenced by other factors . 
&quot; TVK had a good day , but it remains to be seen if it will continue , &quot; Lencs said . 
dealers said Wednesday &apos;s rise in the BUX was moderate as the firming of the dollar did not boost the market as much as in the previous two days , while this week &apos;s rising trend appeared to have lost steam . 
&quot; quiet days will follow , &quot; Czipo said . 
&quot; I expect slight movements up and down in the near future .
