low demand kept a cap on Vietnam &apos;s rice prices this week , though hopes for a major sale to Iran had provided some support , dealers said on Thursday . 
five percent broken grade was quoted at $ 250-260 per tonne fob Saigon Port , little changed from last week . 
ten percent grade was quoted at $ 240-250 per tonne . 
traders said Iranian officials came to Vietnam last week to discuss purchasing 200,000 or 300,000 tonnes of five-percent broken rice , though no deal was signed before they left . 
one trader said the Iranian delegation was looking to pay $ 280 per tonne and Vietnam was asking for $ 310 . 
&quot; If that deal comes through it will make a difference to the market . 
the falls we &apos;ve had recently would stop and you might see a slight increase in prices , &quot; another said . 
dealers said 14 vessels were currently loading in Saigon port , but most were scheduled government-to-government shipments , including some associated with a recent deal to supply up to 200,000 tonnes of rice to the Philippines . 
Vietnam hopes to export more than three million tonnes of rice this year . 
however , the official Evening News said that only 400,000 tonnes was exported in the first quarter , equivalent to 62-72 percent of the volume sold abroad in the same period last year . 
in March , exports were 250,000 tonnes . 
the winter-spring harvest has come late this year and so exports are expected to pick up in the second quarter . 
average monthly exports during that period are expected to be 300,000 to 350,000 tonnes , the paper quoted the Trade Ministry as saying .
