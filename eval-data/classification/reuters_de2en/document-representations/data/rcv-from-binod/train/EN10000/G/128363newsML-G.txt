almost every passing driver waves as if you were a neighbour . 
the main supermarket is so well stocked you can choose between about five varieties of mustard . 
leaves , but no litter , strew the streets . 
it is sometimes hard to picture this confident little town as home to one of Finland &apos;s largest ethnic minorities . 
about 25,000 people inhabit Aland , an archipelago of about 6,500 islands in the Gulf of Bothnia which lies closer to Sweden than Finland . 
they speak Swedish and go for a day &apos;s shopping to Grisslehamn in Sweden ; but strictly , they live in Finland . 
&quot; Ask an Alander whether they feel Swedish or Finnish and most would say &quot; Neither . 
I &apos;m an Alander , &apos; &quot; said Susanne Eriksson , secretary of the Aland parliament . 
Aland , since 1921 an autonomous , demilitarised province of Finland , is unique -- the product of successful international mediation to preserve the identity of a breakaway ethnic group while still binding it to the state that claims it . 
as such , the islands are often visited by politicians looking for a solution for minorities within or beyond their own borders . 
from Hungary to Japan , delegations have come to see if they can use &quot; the Aland model &apos; . 
&quot; The Aland model can &apos;t be used as such anywhere , but the experiences that we have built are interesting to listen to , &quot; said Roger Jansson , head of Aland &apos;s coalition government . 
strategic considerations , not violent popular uprising , are what made the international community pay attention to this tiny cluster of farms and fishing settlements . 
a chronology of Aland &apos;s history is peppered with invasions by Russia . 
in 1714 : &quot; Aland is devastated by the Russians ( the Great wrath ) . 
&quot; In 1742-43 : &quot; Russian troops occupy Aland again ( the Lesser wrath ) &quot; . 
in the early 19th century , Russia won Finland and Aland from Sweden . 
but it was in the early 20th century just before the Soviet revolution -- when Russian troops were stationed on the heavily fortified islands -- that Sweden got really worried . 
for Stockholm , fortified Aland was &quot; a pistol pointing at the heart of Sweden &quot; . 
for the Alanders , one thing was clear . 
&quot; The Alanders didn &apos;t want autonomy , &quot; said Jansson . 
the Swedes wanted Aland , and the Alanders wanted to be in Sweden . 
Finland offered Aland an act guaranteeing autonomy &quot; as vast as possible for an area not being in a state of its own &quot; , but the islanders clung to Sweden . 
only after the Finns had arrested two Aland leaders for high treason did the world get involved . 
at the initiative of the British , the then League of Nations ruled that the recalcitrant Alanders would be an autonomous part of Finland , with international guarantees to preserve their language and culture , in a demilitarised , neutral zone . 
&quot; The least satisfied party at the League of Nations in 1921 -- the Alanders -- are today probably the most satisfied , &quot; said Jansson . 
the act has been revised twice and now , the Aland government can decide for itself on a wide range of internal matters including education , police and communications , with Finland ruling on areas such as foreign affairs and monetary issues . 
Finland &apos;s president has a restricted veto which has only been used once -- in the 1950s , when the islanders chose a flag design which the Finns felt looked too similar to Sweden &apos;s . 
crucially , Finland needs the Alanders &apos; consent for any international treaty relevant to them : so as Finland prepared for its 1995 accession to the European Union , the Alanders had a hand in shaping the treaty to the best of their interests . 
here , economic factors were at play . 
as Aland &apos;s potted history quaintly puts it , the islands since 1959 have been living in &quot; the car-ferry epoch &quot; : the age of towering ships famed in the Nordic region more for cheap alcohol than travel . 
transport , shipping and tourism dominate Aland &apos;s economy , which depends heavily on the duty-free lure of the ferries to support its shipping companies and bring in its annual million-plus visitors , most from Finland and Sweden . 
&quot; These ships are one of the main interests in our business life as a whole , &quot; said Peter Lindback , head of the government administration . 
using the influence of their autonomous status , the islands have negotiated to stay outside the European Union &apos;s tax union , which they hope will let them continue attracting duty-free tourists after the EU bans duty-free sales in 1999 . 
&quot; This also opens the possibility in the future for us to do perhaps as ( the British islands ) Jersey and Guernsey have done -- opening up a tax-free financial centre , &quot; said Lindback . 
as Alanders plan and build from the kernel of independence granted them 75 years ago , their concerns may seem far too sophisticated , their autonomy too well-developed , to be relevant to many other minorities in the world . 
Eriksson pointed out that the Alanders are supported by three advantages which other minorities may not share : they are a homogenous group , geographically isolated with no potential border complications , and they are wealthy . 
the islands are a net contributor to the tune of some 100 million markka ( $ 21.79 million ) annually to Finland &apos;s coffers , Lindback said . 
also unlike many breakaway ethnic groups , the Aland islands are comfortably situated in a stable part of Europe . 
nonetheless , Aland &apos;s solution has been helpful to others : Palestinians took a leaf from Aland &apos;s book in organising police for the territories under their control , and Hungary is trying to cultivate a similar idea for its minorities abroad . 
&quot; The point is , you don &apos;t need ... to get everything in the beginning , &quot; said Jansson . 
&quot; We have always had to struggle for our development -- and the struggle has been long . 
autonomy in the Aland model is , he said , &quot; like a marriage -- there will always be some tension . 
it &apos;s not always easy in the beginning but almost always , in the end , you come to an agreement .
