Dutch supermarkets group Ahold NV said on Wednesday a 54 percent rise in third quarter earnings mainly reflected its acquisition of U.S. grocery chain Stop &amp; Shop , consolidated as of July 22 , 1996 . 
the increase also reflected continued growth in operating results in all areas , the company said in a statement . 
net financial expenses amounted to 87.0 million guilders versus 61.8 million last year . 
the tax burden eased slightly to 24.1 percent from 25.3 percent . 
the number of shares outstanding increased by 31.7 percent . 
consolidated sales jumped by 33.7 percent to 9.3 billion guilders . 
excluding Stop &amp; Shop sales , turnover would have increased by 8.5 percent in the quarter , Ahold said . 
sales in the Netherlands , where both Albert Heijn and Schuitema gained market share rose by 4.3 percent to 3.4 billion guilders . 
turnover in the rest of Europe rose 29.3 percent to 673.5 million guilders . 
stop &amp; Shop significantly boosted U.S. sales , which jumped 57.1 percent to $ 3.1 billion . 
excluding Stop &amp; Shop , U.S. sales would have risen by just 5.6 percent , Ahold said . 
Group operating profit surged 45.8 percent to 307.6 million guilders , primarily due to the Stop &amp; Shop consolidation but also helped by a stronger dollar . 
Ahold said the rise in operating results would have been 42.7 percent at an unchanged dollar rate . 
operating profits in the Netherlands rose 7.5 percent to 110 million guilders , with cost control , higher sales and a slight increase in gross margins lifting earnings at the group &apos;s flagship Albert Heijn supermarket chain . 
the rest of Europe helped fuel the rise in group earnings , with operating profits up 29.7 percent at 40.2 million guilders . 
operating profits in the U.S. rose 103.3 percent to $ 97.8 million . 
stop &amp; Shop contributed $ 52.5 million , which Ahold said fully met its expectations . 
U.S. results included non-recurring provisions and costs of $ 12 million to realign and consolidate existing activities .
