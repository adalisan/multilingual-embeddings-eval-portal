Burma &apos;s top official in the capital Rangoon has urged Buddhist monk organisations to take action against members of the order who break government or Buddhist laws , state-run media reported on Thursday . 
official newspapers quoted Major-General Khin Maung Than , chairman of the Rangoon division of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council , as urging monks to follow laws set by Lord Buddha and the military government . 
he told them to implement Directive Number 65 , passed by the highest body of monks in August 1984 , which calls for action to be taken against monks or novices who violate Buddhist or government laws . 
&quot; He said that violators of Vinaya ( the Buddhist monk code of conduct ) rules and promulgated laws have been encouraged to step up criminal acts as both the government and Sangha ( monk ) organisations more or less ignore them , &quot; the papers reported . 
analysts in Rangoon said the request made by Khin Maung Than showed the government &apos;s determination to take legal action against Buddhist monks . 
in mid-March monks staged protests in Burma &apos;s second city Mandalay in unrest apparently sparked by tensions between Buddhist and Moslem residents . 
unrest spread across the country leading the government to impose a curfew and other restrictions in several cities . 
most of the restrictions are still in place . 
witnesses said at least 100 monks in Rangoon were detained in late March . 
others said dozens of monks were at least temporarily held in Mandalay and other cities after the unrest . 
the government has not commented on reports of the arrests . 
the harshest punishment the monks &apos; organisation can dole out is to disrobe a member of the order . 
but if a monk is found guilty of breaking the nation &apos;s laws he is punished according to federal laws which could mean imprisonment . 
monks played a key role in pro-democracy protests between 1988-90 . 
thousands were detained after many monks refused to perform religious rights for soldiers or their families in 1990 following military crackdowns on the democracy movement .
