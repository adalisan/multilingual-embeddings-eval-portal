the United States called on Thursday for urgent negotiations to conclude global bans on landmines and production of nuclear bomb-making fissile material , saying both issues were ripe for resolution . 
John Holum , director of the U.S. arms control and disarmament agency , also said Washington would not sign any accord which emerged from the Canadian initiative on landmines because key states would not be covered . 
China and Russia -- major producers and users of landmines -- are not part of the &quot; Ottawa Process &quot; . 
the U.S. stand means Canada can at best achieve a landmine pact among like-minded middle and minor powers , without the main players . 
Western diplomats say a viable , universal ban could only be concluded at the wider Conference on Disarmament , where the issue has so far been blocked . 
in a speech kicking off a seven-week session , Holum said the forum &apos;s credibility depended on launching negotiations to ban landmines and production of fissile material . 
&quot; Let us negotiate both treaties that are now ready for action , &quot; Holum said . 
&quot; anti-personnel landmines , or APL , have catastrophic consequences for civilian populations , &quot; he added . 
&quot; In our view , the Conference on Disarmament should promptly agree to commence negotiations , and complete a global ban at the earliest time &quot; . 
Canada &apos;s disarmament ambassador Mark Moher vowed to forge ahead with its efforts begun in October 1996 , saying his country still aimed to have a landmines treaty ban signed in December . 
&quot; We are determined to proceed without interruption to meet the objective of signing the treaty in Ottawa in December , and thereafter working towards the widest possible acceptance of that text , &quot; Moher said in a speech . 
Russia sent an observer to a Canadian-backed session of 50 countries in Vienna last February . 
Holum said the United States would send an observer to the next session in Brussels in June . 
&quot; We are wishing that process well , &quot; Holum told a news conference . 
&quot; At the same time , our national position requires that the treaty we ultimately participate in be a truly global ban on anti-personnel landmines . 
&quot; The indications are that the process in Ottawa will produce a treaty , or an agreement , that is accepted by like-minded countries but does not include a number of countries that are critically important for this treaty to be truly global and for it to have the broad effect that we think is necessary . 
asked whether this meant Washington would not sign an accord under Ottawa , Holum replied : &quot; That is our current position &quot; . 
analysts said the United States would be reluctant to back a Canadian pact not only because would it leave out major players , but it would be hard to sell a humanitarian treaty lacking a verification mechanism to the Senate . 
diplomats say Mexico , and to a lesser extent countries including South Korea , Turkey , Russia , China and Pakistan have blocked launching landmine negotiations in the Geneva talks , they added . 
the United-Nations sponsored body still lacks a formal work programme for 1997 . 
the five declared nuclear powers -- Britain , China , France , Russia and United States -- are among 61 members . 
some key diplomats saw hope of launching Geneva negotiations to ban landmines by the end of the June . 
the lethal weapons are blamed for killing 25,000 people a year and maiming even more . 
Japan &apos;s envoy Hisami Kurokochi said in a speech : &quot; Perhaps most encouraging is the fact that the tide of support for a total ban on anti-personnel landmines has become irreversible . 
Japan and Hungary on Thursday proposed a mandate for a committee to negotiate a treaty to ban stockpiling , production and transfer of landmines . 
a special co-ordinator could be appointed next week to try to reach consensus on a mandate . 
French disarmament ambassador Joelle Bourgois told Reuters : &quot; Things are probably going to start moving on mines before the end of this session . 
&quot; China &apos;s envoy Sha Zukang added : &quot; Things are still ambiguous , but there are developments on mines &quot; . 
Holum again rejected a push by non-aligned states led by India to negotiate global nuclear disarmament in Geneva talks . 
Washington favoured a step-by-step approach , starting with an accord to halt production of fissile material used in making nuclear weapons -- plutonium and highly-enriched uranium . 
&quot; I think the fissile material cut-off is something that if negotiations were begun in earnest , could be completed within a year , &quot; Holum told the news conference .
