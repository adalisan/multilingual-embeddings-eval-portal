U.S. municipal bonds slipped slightly in early afternoon trade on Thursday , with yields rising one to two basis points in a retreat seen as an effort to consolidate after the market &apos;s recent drive higher . 
&quot; We &apos;re just going through a little consolidation mode after a run-up . 
I think people are squaring positions as we get closer to the weekend , &quot; a trader said . 
the secondary market , though also fairly quiet , was focusing on three to four bid-wanted lists , which reflected their owners continued attempts to sell off run-of-the-mill issues to make room for the new . 
the big drop in yields seen over the past few weeks has yet to trigger an avalaunche of refundings , which was probably why institutional players have only slightly stepped up their selling interest . 
&quot; To some degree , but nothing of significance , &quot; a trader said . 
in the past week or so , the secondary market , as gauged by Standard and Poor Corp &apos;s Blue List , has climbed to nearly $ 1.4 billion , roughly $ 500 million more than levels seen early last week . 
while jobless claims fell sharply in the latest week , dropping to 299,000 in the week ended July 19 from a revised total of 341,000 in the previous week , the surprising decline largely was attributed to special factors . 
economists had looked for initial claims to total about 333,000 . 
September municipal bond futures traded in Chicago shed nine ticks to 120-29 / 32 . 
September Treasury bond futures edged dwon six ticks to 115-6 / 32 . 
in the secondary market , traders said that New York City general obligation bonds , which were freed to trade at mid-morning , were selling around the original issue price . 
Atlanta , Georgia , Water and sewer revenues of 2027 , which pay a 5-1 / 4 percent coupon , were bid at 5.36 percent , net , up one basis point . 
and Florida State Transportation Right of Way bonds of 2022 , which carry a five percent coupon , were bid at 5.27 percent , net , unchanged .
