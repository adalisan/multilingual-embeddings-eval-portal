Russian President Boris Yeltsin said on Saturday he had agreed with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to maintain an &quot; intensive dialogue &quot; on plans , which Moscow opposes , to expand the NATO defence alliance into eastern Europe . 
Itar-Tass and Interfax news agencies said Yeltsin told them he agreed during talks with Kohl at his hunting lodge near Moscow &quot; to continue an intensive dialogue at various levels &quot; . 
&quot; The question is not simple , but I hope that by the European summit in Lisbon in December 1996 we will be able jointly to find a wise solution , &quot; he said , referring to a planned summit of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 
an unidentified source told TASS earlier that Kohl had promised that no decisions on NATO enlargement to the east would be taken this year . 
Yeltsin , who announced this week he will have heart surgery at the end of the month , added he was &quot; completely satisfied &quot; with the talks with Kohl , a personal friend and the first western leader he has met since his reelection on July 3 . 
&quot; Our meetings are always marked by warmth and openness and bring concrete results , &quot; he said . 
&quot; This meeting once again showed that Germany is an important partner for Russia . 
Interfax quoted unidentified sources as saying that Yeltsin would visit the German spa of Baden-Baden early next year , where he would be presented with a prize by the German press . 
the sources also told Interfax that Yeltsin and Kohl agreed to take a break together next year on Lake Baikal in Siberia .
