Belgian linear bonds , which ended a quiet but well supported Wednesday barely changed from overnight levels , are likely to continue drifting at least until Friday &apos;s U.S. jobs figures , traders said . 
&quot; Tuesday &apos;s NAPM was disappointing for the bears , but if you look at the breakdown it is by no means certain that a rate hike in the U.S. is necessary either , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; So people are waiting for the August non-farm payrolls on Friday . 
&quot; For now the market is pretty strong because there are no sellers . 
there are a lot of locked-in profits that no one wants to take yet , &quot; he added . 
&quot; But when it moves it will be quick . 
&quot; As long as this enormous carry is there , the market will stay where it is , &quot; he added . 
traders noted some slight steepening of the yield curve for short maturity paper , and some selling interest in very long maturities . 
but they noted that few domestic players were involved and there was no real volume . 
the benchmark 2006 OLO ended the day yielding 6.63 percent against 6.64 on Tuesday , with the premium over Bunds an unchanged 24 basis points . 
the front month futures contract was up eight bps at 116.42 .
