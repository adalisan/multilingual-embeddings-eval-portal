Taiwan share prices were up but off earlier highs in late Tuesday trade on weak sentiment and profit-taking by short-term investors . 
at 0320 GMT , with 40 minutes to go , the weighted index rose 25.28 points , or 0.31 percent , to 8,294.71 . 
&quot; The stock market is in a vacuum period . 
many investors had sold shares they believed were over-valued , and they have not found new investment targets , &quot; said Joe Chiou , an analyst of Taiwan Securities Investment . 
the overnight rise on Wall Street had no major impact , brokers said . 
electronics companies in northern Hsinchu science-based Industrial Park faced selling because many firms &apos; operations were forced to shut down due to a 20-minute power outage on Monday .
