the Bank of Canada on Friday set a second round of special purchase and resale agreements in the money market at 3.25 percent , traders said . 
dealers said the Bank of Canada intervened after the call loan rate traded to the top of the central bank &apos;s 2.75-3.25 percent target range . 
&quot; There &apos;s no change in policy . 
it &apos;s month end and there &apos;s probably some tightness in the system , &quot; said a T-bill trader with one bank-owned brokerage . 
&quot; There &apos;s nothing to be alarmed about . 
the three-month cash T-bill traded with a yield of 2.96 percent in the wake of the intervention .
