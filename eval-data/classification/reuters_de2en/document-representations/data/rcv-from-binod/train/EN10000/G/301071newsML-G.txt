Russia voiced its concern on Saturday over growing tensions in neighbouring Bulgaria , which it described as a friendly state once seen as an &quot; island of stability &quot; in the troubled Balkans . 
a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry said Moscow hoped the crisis in Bulgaria would be resolved &quot; through dialogue within the constitution and democratic traditions &quot; . 
Bulgarian opposition protestors who want to break the ex-communist ruling party &apos;s grip on power formed a human chain around the parliament building on Friday . 
the action turned into a 10-hour siege during during which demonstrators broke windows in the parliament and smashed and overturned cars outside . 
&quot; Such developments are worrying especially because we are talking about a friendly state that has enjoyed in recent years a well-deserved reputation as an &quot; island of stability &apos; in the troubled Balkan region , &quot; the statement said .
