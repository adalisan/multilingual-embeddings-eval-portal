the Slovak Finance Ministry will auction an unspecified tranche of four-week treasury bills on Wednesday , the central bank said in a statement on Monday . 
the ministry rejected all bids in its last auction of four-week T-bills on June 4 , after it had accepted an average yield of 14.21 percent on May 7 . 
the ministry does not set an amount on offer at state securities auctions , nor does it set a minimum or maximum limit price on bids . 
it uses T-bills and state bonds as the main tools to cover the state budget deficit , which totalled 4.692 billion crowns for the first four months of 1997 , up from a shortfall of 3.45 billion crowns for the first quarter .
