deals on both paper and wet Brent markets were scarce as players focused on volatile outright values in a news-driven market , traders said . 
January Brent paper traded twice at $ 24.45 a barrel before Brent futures came off on news about the likely timing of Iraqi crude exports and the end of Elf &apos;s French refinery strikes . 
Intermonth spreads were slightly softer in the afternoon with Jan / Feb trading at + 73 cts , a cent or two below earlier talk . 
CFDs were unchanged in the absence of fresh physical deals . 
a roll of Dec 9-13 dates into Dec 16-20 was done at 31 cents . 
physical Brent was untraded on Friday with traders saying a cargo offered late on Thursday at Jan + 40 cents failed to find bidders . 
the seller reported withdrawing the cargo for want of higher bids . 
dated Brent was notionally valued at between a premium of 35-40 cents over January paper . 
all four Brent dates which turned wet on Friday were kept . 
traders said the absence of a North Sea glut coming into the slow Christmas season was likely to keep differentials steady with only a handful of December barrels still looking for homes . 
a cargo of Statfjord loading Dec 24-26 fetched dated Brent + 45 cents , up two cents from the last done deal . 
Duc loading early January traded at a 23 cent premium to dated Brent . 
Iraq said on Friday that it would be able to export crude starting Tuesday if the U.N. Secretary-General , Boutros Boutros-Ghali , submitted his final report as scheduled on Monday . 
but Boutros-Ghali said later that he could not confirm the start date for the Iraqi oil-for-food accord , saying he must wait for a report from inspectors before issuing clearance . 
a senior London trader said the additional Iraqi crude was not likely to have much impact on a tight market .
