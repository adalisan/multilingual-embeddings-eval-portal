with pressure mounting from the United States , Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo lashed out at high-level government corruption on Wednesday and pledged no mercy in the fight against drugs and crime . 
&quot; We must establish , clearly , the notion that in our country there should not and cannot be anyone untouchable , &quot; Zedillo said in a speech to Mexico &apos;s Jewish community . 
&quot; I am absolutely determined and committed to work to the end of my abilities , to the last drop of my energy to deal with this problem , &quot; he said . 
calling on Mexicans to become &quot; intolerant of law-breaking , &quot; Zedillo dismissed &quot; skeptics , cynics and those who rashly believe that we are not serious . 
his remarks coincided with a fierce debate over whether President Bill Clinton should &quot; certify &quot; Mexico is cooperating with the United States in its fight against illegal drugs . 
he is required to make a decision by the end of the month . 
last week Mexico &apos;s antinarcotics Czar Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo was fired and arrested on charges that he worked for Amado Carrillo Fuentes , the head of Mexico &apos;s most powerful drugs cartel . 
the New York Times also published allegations this week that two Mexican state governors and the father , brother and late brother-in-law of ex-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari were all involved with drug-traffickers . 
the governors and the Salinas family have denied the allegations . 
Zedillo made the remarks replying to complaints by Jewish community leaders about government corruption and high crime levels . 
&quot; We view with concern , impotence and annoyance how drug-trafficking continues to permeate our society ... reaching high levels of authority which we had believed incorruptible , &quot; community leader Alfredo Achar told Zedillo . 
the Clinton administration will not decide whether to certify Mexico as an ally in the drug war until Friday at the earliest , the State Department said on Wednesday .
