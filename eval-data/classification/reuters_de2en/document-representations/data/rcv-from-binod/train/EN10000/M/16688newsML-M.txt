the dollar closed mixed in the U.S. , rescued by profit-taking from an overnight mark rally and buffeted by mounting fears Wednesday &apos;s Tankan report will show strong economic growth in Japan , dealers said . 
the dollar fell overnight against the mark and Swiss franc , but recovered in New York trading on profit-taking after a break of technical support at 1.4750 marks , dealers said . 
&quot; Basically we hit some stops , but failed to take it any lower . 
we saw some covering of those short positions and consolidated higher , &quot; said Seth Garrett , chief currency dealer at CS First Boston . 
against the yen , the dollar stayed in a narrow range , surrendering modest overnight gains in U.S. trade as investors pondered the Tankan economic report from Japan due Wednesday . 
many dealers expect the quarterly report to show enough strength to build a case for higher Japanese interest rates . 
&quot; The Tankan is supposed to favor a recovery for Japan , &quot; said Greg Perman , chief dealer at Credit Commericale de France . 
&quot; But I think people will sell the dollar tomorrow either way . 
the dollar closed higher at 1.4781 / 89 marks Tuesday , up from 1.4759 / 62 at the open , but fell to 107.65 / 75 yen from 107.84 / 94 . 
the dollar rose to 1.1930 / 40 Swiss francs from 1.1902 / 09 . 
investors had expected the dollar to rally after the Bundesbank aggressively lowered Germany &apos;s repo rate to 3.0 percent from 3.3 percent last Thursday . 
but the dollar has failed to rally and many market players have begun to price in eventual German monetary tightening , dealers said . 
&quot; People are still trying to decide whether the Bundesbank has made its final rate cut , &quot; said Seth Garrett , chief currency dealer at CS First Boston . 
in addition , some players have been disappointed by the dollar &apos;s inability to overtake relatively minor technical resistance at 1.48 marks and 108 yen in recent sessions and are looking for reasons to sell . 
&quot; The longs are not getting enough bang for their buck , &quot; said Greg Perman , chief dealer at Credit Commerciale de France . 
like Monday &apos;s session , Tuesday saw light volume with little force behind any of the day &apos;s price moves , dealers said . 
&quot; We saw reasonable amounts of trading going through early , but there was little follow-through , &quot; added Garrett . 
in late New York trading the dollar got a minor boost from a Reuters Fiancial Television interview with U.S. Treasury Secretary Rubin , who reiterated the administration &apos;s commitment to a strong dollar , dealers said . 
&quot; There was an extremely minute blip when he said that , but it &apos;s not really news . 
we know they don &apos;t want the dollar collapsing against the yen , &quot; Garrett said . 
shortly thereafter the dollar fell by a similar amount when the Treasury announced the results of its latest auction of two-year notes , which some analysts deemed disappointing . 
&quot; The auction didn &apos;t go great and there &apos;s a fear that Japanese investors own a little too much of our treasuries , &quot; Perman said . 
dealers expected a more active session on Wednesday after the Tankan &apos;s release . 
&quot; People are waiting for that report to come out , &quot; Perman said . 
&quot; It &apos;s been so dead in the last 48 hours it &apos;s not funny . 
in other trading , the British pound fell to $ 1.5542 / 49 from $ 1.5579 / 85 at the open . 
the Australian dollar slipped to $ 0.7880 / 85 from $ 0.7890 / 95 .
