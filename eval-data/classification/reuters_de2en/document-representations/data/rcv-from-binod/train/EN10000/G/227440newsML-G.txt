mother Teresa was in critical condition on Sunday and long-standing lung and renal diseases forced doctors to postpone treatment to correct her irregular heart rhythm , hospital officials said . 
&quot; Mother Teresa up to this moment remains in critical condition , &quot; a regular bulletin from the B.M. 
Birla Heart Research Centre in the eastern Indian city of Calcutta said . 
a bulletin issued several hours earlier had said the 86-year-old Roman Catholic missionary was stable , comfortable and cheerful . 
but the latest bulletin , issued at 12.45 p.m. ( 0715 GMT ) , said : &quot; Even though the ischaemia ( blood supply reduction ) of the heart has been corrected , her heart rhythm is still irregular . 
&quot; Her long-standing lung and renal diseases continue to be a major concern , which could complicate heart condition and recovery , &quot; it added . 
mother Teresa underwent life-saving surgery at the clinic on Friday to clear two coronary artery blockages . 
clinic administrator A.K. 
Chatterjee said doctors had postponed drug treatment for an irregular heart rhythm following the latest developments . 
Dr Tarun Praharaj , a member of her medical team , said : &quot; These multiple problems are cropping up because of her age . 
&quot; She has got a chronic lung problem and borderline renal impairment , &quot; he told reporters . 
he said a renal specialist was being consulted by the heart clinic . 
on Saturday , American doctor Patricia Aubanel , another member of the team , said Mother Teresa had developed signs of bronchial pneumonia , which was being treated . 
mother Teresa , the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize winner and known as the &quot; Saint of the gutters &quot; for her devotion to the poor , destitute and dying , was fitted with a heart pacemaker in 1989 . 
Dr D.P. 
Shetty , the medical team leader , told reporters earlier on Sunday that doctors were trying to correct with drugs her arrhythmia , or irregular heart rhythm . 
&quot; We are trying to correct her arrhythmia with medicine and we will watch her for two or three days . 
&quot; If it does not work , then only we have to go for mild electric shock or the mechanical cardioversion , &quot; he added . 
Aubanel , who treated Mother Teresa in California in 1991 , said cardioversion treatment for an arrhythmia was essential . 
&quot; It is absolutely necessary now for her to go for the cardioversion ... 
there is some risk but she can &apos;t leave the hospital without this treatment , &quot; she added on Saturday . 
&quot; Our first choice is pharmacological cardioversion because Mother Teresa had refused to have electric shocks on a couple of occasions before , &quot; Aubanel said . 
mother Teresa , born of Albanian parents as Gonxhe Bojaxhi , was moved to the Birla clinic last Tuesday after entering the nearby woodlands nursing Home on November 22 . 
nuns at the Calcutta headquarters of the missionaries of Charity prayed for her recovery on Sunday in a meeting that also included Hindus , Moslems , Sikhs and Buddhists . 
&quot; She is the only one who has done something for those with leprosy . 
we know that God will listen to our prayers and she will be alright , &quot; Sheikh Mukhtar , a leprosy patient , said . 
the charity , with 456 centres in 111 countries , was founded by Mother Teresa in 1948 . 
it feeds 500,000 families each year , teaches 20,000 children in its schools and treats 90,000 lepers in its clinics . 
it also runs orphanages and other homes for the dying .
