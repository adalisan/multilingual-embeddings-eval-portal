U.S. stocks were strong at midday on Wednesday , as the bond market recovered from recent losses and technology shares surged after Microsoft Corp said it would invest in Apple Computer Inc . 
the Dow industrials , which have struggled recently as interest rates crept higher , gained ground on Wednesday as bond yields fell . 
the blue-chip average was up 55 points , or 0.68 percent , at 8243 , while the long bond gained 4 / 32 to yield 6.48 percent . 
but the Dow turned around as bonds erased losses ahead of a closely watched Treasury auction of $ 12 billion in 10-year notes and the release of the Federal Reserve Beige Book data . 
&quot; Today appears to be more of catchup day for the Dow , which had been struggling lately , &quot; Greg NIE , technical analyst at EVEREN Securities , said . 
most analysts had not expected the bond market to recover until after Thursday , when the Treasury was scheduled to sell $ 10 billion in 30-year bonds , Johnson said . 
&quot; The bond market rebound is coming a little earlier than expected , which is very good news , &quot; he said . 
Microsoft &apos;s announcement of a $ 150 million investment in Apple also added fire to the technology sector and the broader stock market , analysts said . 
&quot; The technology market was looking for an excuse to rally and the excitement around Apple gave traders that excuse , &quot; Frank Calta , managing director of institutional trading at Dain Bosworth said . 
apple &apos;s stock soared 6-1 / 2 to 26-1 / 4 in active trade . 
the company also announced a broad series of alliances with Microsoft , as well as the replacement of all but two of its directors . 
&quot; The Apple news is simply really exciting , &quot; Johnson said . 
Microsoft stock gained 5 / 16 to 143-5 / 8 . 
among other active issues , ITT Corp stock rose 1-15 / 16 to 64-7 / 8 after Hilton Hotels Corp said it increased its hostile bid for the company to $ 70 per share . 
ITT said it would consider the new takeover offer &quot; in due course . 
&quot; Hilton shares dropped 15 / 16 to 31-13 / 16 . 
shares of Cisco Systems Inc lost 1-12 / 16 to 80-3 / 16 in brisk trade , after it posted fiscal fourth-quarter results that met Wall Street forecasts but fell short of the so-called &quot; whisper &quot; number , or unpublished estimates .
