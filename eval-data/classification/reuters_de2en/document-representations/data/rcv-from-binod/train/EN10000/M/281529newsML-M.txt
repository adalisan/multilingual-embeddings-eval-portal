the precious metals languished in tiny price ranges amid extremely quiet trading conditions ahead of the New Year holiday , dealers said . 
Bullion was fixed marginally firmer at $ 369.55 an ounce , compared to $ 369.25 on Monday afternoon and a London close of $ 369.10 / $ 369.60 . 
there will be no afternoon gold , platinum or palladium fixes on December 31 . 
dealers predicted prices would remain wedged within a narrow $ 368- $ 370 price range through the end of the week . 
&quot; Everything is practically shut down and we &apos;re not expecting any movement until at least Monday , &quot; one said . 
but gold was seen by several analysts and dealers as being on the verge of break-out following weeks of indecisive sideways movement since gold &apos;s decline to three-year lows in November . 
overall market sentiment was on the bearish side , with any shift to the downside expected to encounter support around $ 365 , analysts said . 
silver was also virtually static in early trading after tumbling sharply on Monday on a bout of trade selling . 
prices were indicated about one cent up from Monday &apos;s closing level , at $ 4.81 / $ 4.83 . 
silver was seen consolidating above the $ 4.80 support level in the near future . 
&quot; It was a classic for silver , it fell 10 cents with no bounce , no follow-through or retracement , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; It &apos;s indicative of a lack of interest in all the precious metals right now , &quot; a dealer said . 
platinum was up $ 1.50 at $ 370.00 / $ 371.00 , after weakening briefly on the back of silver on Monday . 
palladium was barely changed at $ 116.25 / $ 117.25 .
