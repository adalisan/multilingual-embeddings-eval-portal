10-year bond yield spread touched its lowest level since the early 1980s after second quarter wages data enhanced the changes of a policy easing , possibily as early as Friday . 
this spread made a strong test of 25 basis points at one stage after average weekly ordinary time earnings came in weaker than expectations with the annual rate falling to 3.7 percent , its lowest level since August 1994 . 
the data follows Wednesday &apos;s extremely subdued inflation report , which showed the policy sensitive underlying rate at 1.7 percent , its lowest since 1971 , and today &apos;s data was seen confirming the low inflation enviroment , analysts said . 
&quot; entrenched low inflation increases the prospect of the Australian 10-year bond trading at , or below , yield par with U.S. treasuries , &quot; said Stephen Roberts at UBS Australia . 
at the spread low , the 10-year cash bond yield was under 6.40 percent as the market fully priced in a 50 basis point easing in current 5.5 percent official interest rates . 
however , &quot; There is a strong chance that 10-year yields will end 1997 at 7.0 percent plus with the spread back towards 100 basis points once the market sees growth accelerating and the spare capacity in the economy start to be absorbed , &quot; said Stephen Koukoulas , chief economist at Citibank Australia . 
in the meantime , the market will be on full alert for a policy announecment by the Reserve Bank at 9.30 a.m. ( 2330 GMT ) , on Friday , and if it does not occur then , everyday until after the Reserve Bank board meeting on August 5 . 
U.S. treasuries remained around their softer price levels during Tokyo trading as the market gave up some ground after Tuesday &apos;s steamy rally . 
Canadian bonds also underperformed on Wednesday as the market absorbed a C $ 1.3 billion 30-year bond auction , while the short end of the New Zealand curve outshone the bloc as the N.Z. 
dollar made solid gains against the Australian and U.S. dollars .
