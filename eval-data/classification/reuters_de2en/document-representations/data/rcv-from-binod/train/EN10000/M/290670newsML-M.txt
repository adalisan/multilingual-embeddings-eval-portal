Polish shares jumped in surging turnover and analysts saw them extending gains on Wednesday following Tuesday &apos;s strong buying after price fixing . 
&quot; Perhaps it &apos;s a beginning of a longer tendency as we have rises in the whole Eastern-European region , but the impetus of the growth suggests it might end soon , &quot; said Mateusz Andrzejewski , an analyst at Pekao SA brokerage . 
some analysts said the WIG index might pierce the 15,000 psychological resistance as early as on Wednesday , but others said it was more likely to end slightly below the barrier . 
the main market &apos;s WIG index rose 2.4 percent , to 14,772.1 , and turnover jumped 56 percent to 153.2 million zlotys on both markets as 61 issues rose , five fell and 18 were flat . 
some analysts said Tuesday &apos;s growth might have been caused by foreign investors opening positions . 
&quot; There are many recommendations saying Poland &apos;s market will go up in 1997 , there is definitely an interest in Poland , &quot; said Jacek Dzierwa , an analyst at Salomon Brothers in London . 
but he stressed that it was difficult to say after one session of such growth if the market would go up significantly . 
they said Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy ( BPH ) , one of Warsaw bourse &apos;s large caps surged 8.1 percent in the session &apos;s heaviest 20.2-million-zloty turnover possibly on one large buy order . 
they said it was difficult to explain the scale of Mostostal Warszawa &apos;s 9.9-percent soar , Mostostal Zabrze &apos;s 9.7 percent and Krosno &apos;s 9.7-percent jumps . 
NFI units were flat in a 17.4-million turnover in the regular session and rose in 11.7-million-zloty continuous trade .
