Massachusetts &apos; highest court Friday struck down the state &apos;s term limit law that bars politicians from seeking re-election after two terms in a particular office . 
the Massachusetts State Supreme Court ruled that the law , which was narrowly passed by voters in a 1994 referendum , was unconstitutional . 
&quot; I am furious , &quot; said Dorothea Vitrac , the head of limits II , a citizens group that helped draft the law angered by the raises and perks legislators had given themselves . 
&quot; The court receives its pay and its budget from the Legislature . 
they &apos;re not about to bite the hand that feeds them and limit the terms , &quot; she said . 
&quot; The Massachusetts State Supreme Court , when it comes to the Legislature , are holding hands . 
they &apos;re in bed together . 
limits II will review the ruling before considering its next move , she said . 
earlier this month , Massachusetts House Speaker Thomas Finneran , a Democrat , rewarded key legislators - the chairmen and vice chairmen and ranking Republicans of the Rules and Long Term Debt committees and four division chairs - with bonus pay retroactive to January 1996 . 
Finneran said the raise was to &quot; reward good work . 
but other legislators , especially the Republican minority , have sought to overturn the speaker &apos;s largesse . 
a rollcall vote on the raises is set for next week .
