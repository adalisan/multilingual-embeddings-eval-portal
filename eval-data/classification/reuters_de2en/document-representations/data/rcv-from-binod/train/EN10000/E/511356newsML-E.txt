following are highlights from a Reuter poll of 23 economists on the French economy ( using the median forecast , mid-point of the range ) . 
forecasts were provided between April 2 and April 8 . 
short of revising its longstanding forecast in the wake of the dollar &apos;s rise against the franc , the government now says its expectation of 2.3 percent growth this year is cautious and that growth will be &quot; at least &quot; this much . 
the previous Reuter poll , which was published on January 28 , showed economists counting on GDP growth of 2.1 percent in 1997 and 2.5 percent in 1998 . 
some politicians have predicted that the dollar rise versus the franc over the last several months could add as much as 0.5 percent to the GDP growth rate this year , principally by making French exports relatively more competitive . 
in the latest poll , economists at French institutions tended to have somewhat higher growth forecasts than their counterparts at foreign ones , although there was no clear-cut division . 
economists count on it retreating to 2.9 percent in 1998 . 
this is unchanged from the last quarterly poll . 
* unemployment rate , currently at record 12.8 percent , seen at 12.75 percent in 1997 and 12.4 percent in 1998 . 
economists believe the situation will improve modestly in the second half of this year , principally in the fourth quarter . 
the forecast for 1997 is minimally lower than in the previous poll , where it was seen at 12.8 percent . 
but the 1998 forecast is unchanged from previously . 
* intervention rate : Central bank seen further whittling the already narrow gap between this key official interest rate and the equivalent German repo rate , in continuation of cautious policy , before tightening in first quarter of next year . 
intervention rate , which sets floor for money market rates , seen bottoming out at 3.08 percent in the third quarter of this year , staying at this level until the end of 1997 and edging up in 1998 , to 3.5 percent in the first quarter of 1999 . 
Bank of France has been lowering intervention rate by small amounts at a time through 1996 / 1997 , closer to a German repo rate which currently stands at 3.0 percent . 
* consumer spending , which the government hopes will underpin an upturn in GDP growth , seen rising 1.35 percent in 1997 and 2.3 percent in 1998 , slightly below the official 1.4 percent 1997 forecast but higher in 1998 than the 1.9 percent government forecast for that year . 
* inflation seen at 1.6 percent in 1997 and 1.8 percent in 1998 , slightly below the previous poll forecast for this year and the same as forecast previously for 1998 . 
the level stays within the ceiling of two percent which the Bank of France uses as its guideline for the next two years . 
Bank of France governor Jean-Claude Trichet has said the franc &apos;s correct level against the mark is its central rate in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism -- 3.3538 -- suggesting he believes this is the level at which rates are irrevocably fixed under monetary union . 
* franc / dollar exchange rate : the dollar has risen in the past several months to levels considered more reasonable by the French government , but the expectations are for the franc to gain weight relative to the U.S. currency in the coming months , from a second quarter median forecast of 5.76 to a fourth quarter 1998 median estimate of 5.44 . 
economists say they expect French and German bond yields to converge ahead of monetary union . 
they see yields on 10-year French government bonds climbing from 5.9 percent in the second quarter of this year to 6.50 percent at the end of next year .
