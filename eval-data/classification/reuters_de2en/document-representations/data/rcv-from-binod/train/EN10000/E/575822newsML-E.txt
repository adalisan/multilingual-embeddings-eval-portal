Argentina said Monday it hopes to collect between $ 4.3 billion and $ 4.4 billion in tax revenues in May , compared with $ 3.6 billion in May 1996 . 
it also said it expects to have a treasury surplus in the same month , following a $ 754 million shortfall in May 1996 and a $ 410 million deficit in April this year . 
the last time the country registered a treasury surplus was in June 1996 . 
Under-Secretary of Tax Policy Guillermo Rodriguez Use told reporters that May tax collection figures in part look better than in the comparative month last year because this time they include personal income taxes . 
personal income taxes this year were collected in April and May and last year in June . 
Rodriguez Use said value added tax revenue was expected to be around $ 1.6 million in May , the same as May 1996 and slightly better than April 1997 . 
but the official said VAT was able to keep its level mostly due to income from imports . 
he said there was no growth of revenue from domestic market sales . 
he reiterated previous estimates of $ 8.2 billion in income taxes for the whole year .
