the reintroduction of cotton futures trading in India after a gap of nearly 30 years will be among the 1997 / 98 ( April-March ) budget measures debated in parliament next week . 
the three-day debate on the budget , stalled by the political crisis which culminated last week in a confidence vote defeat for the United Front ( UF ) government , begins on Monday . 
in the meantime , the UF is expected to choose a new leader to takeover from Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda , in order to appease the rival Congress party and win back its support for a new UF minority coalition government . 
&quot; The budget &apos;s fate is hanging in balance , &quot; said one trader . 
traders said they hoped the proposal to reintroduce cotton futures trading , which meshs with the country &apos;s programme of liberalisation begun six years ago , would be approved without many changes . 
futures trading in key commodities , including cotton , was banned in the early 1960s in a bid to curb speculation and stabilise prices . 
&quot; I see some oppostion to futures trading coming from communists who look at it as an instrument of capitalism , &quot; said another trader . 
&quot; All this adds up to some delay . 
in the market , during the week to Thursday , prices were slightly subdued on sluggish mill demand and an improved supply following the end of a nationwide truckers strike , traders said . 
the 10-day strike , which crippled cotton supplies , was called off on April 10 . 
in spot , Bengal-deshi fell 25 rupees to 880 / 925 rupees per maund ( 37.32 kg ) and Punjab saw-ginned lost 20 / 40 rupees to 1,510 / 1,640 rupees per maund . 
Gujarat Kalyan ( medium staple ) shed 500 rupees to 13,200 / 13,500 rupees per candy ( 355.56 kg ) . 
Long-staple Gujarat Sankar-4 lost 400 / 500 rupees to 15,500 / 17,000 rupees per candy for the average variety and to 18,000 / 19,300 rupees for the superior variety . 
average daily arrivals in India &apos;s northern state of Punjab rose to 10,000 / 12,000 bales ( 170 kg each ) against 4,000 / 5,000 bales in the first two weeks of the current month . 
&quot; Mill demand is low and export business dull and I am expecting local prices to remain weak or move in a narrow price band in the coming few days , &quot; said Chandulal Thakker , a leading cotton trader . 
traders expect prices to firm in the next two-three months ahead of monsoon rains and sowing operations for the next season beginning September .
