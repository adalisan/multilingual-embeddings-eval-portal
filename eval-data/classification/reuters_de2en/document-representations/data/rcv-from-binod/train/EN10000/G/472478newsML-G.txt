a northeast Republican congressman is circulating a letter urging his colleagues to consider the views of the medical profession , which generally supports a Clinton administration plan to tighten air quality standards . 
but an aide to the congressmen , Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York , said that does not necessarily mean the congressman supports the proposed standards as they are written . 
&quot; We have not taken a position on the regulations themselves , but we were concerned the debate is becoming skewed in one direction and we wanted to make sure all sides were heard . 
there is scientific evidence to support stronger standards , &quot; Boehlert &apos;s aide said . 
Republicans generally have appeared hostile or at least skeptical of the Clinton administration &apos;s plan to tighten standards against smog and soot , questioning whether there was enough scientific evidence to support them and whether the health benefits would justify the costs . 
but Boehlert signed on to the letter with Connecticut Democratic Sen. Joseph Lieberman , an outspoken advocate of the new standards . 
&quot; It obviously indicates we &apos;re not dead set against them . 
our views are not identical to Sen. Lieberman , but like him we felt the views of the medical profession were central to the discussion , &quot; Boehlert &apos;s aide said . 
accompanying the lawmakers &apos; letter was one to President Clinton signed by some 1,375 doctors , scientists , professors , researchers and other health professional that urged Clinton to support &quot; air pollution standards that are at least as protective as those proposed . 
Boehlert &apos;s and Lieberman &apos;s northeast region generally also supports stronger standards because the region says the new rules would reduce pollution blowing in from the Midwest that is making it more difficult to clean the Northeast &apos;s air . 
Senate Environment Committee Chairman John Chafee , a Rhode Island Republican , has expressed reservations about the proposal , but northeast Republican governors generally are backing the administration &apos;s plan .
