water temperatures in the Pacific Ocean could rise to their highest levels of the century in the coming months , unleashing a devastating wave of climatic disasters , Britain &apos;s Meteorological Office on Thursday . 
the warm-ocean phenomenon , dubbed &quot; El Nino &quot; -- the baby Jesus in Spanish -- by Peruvian fisherman because it tends to peak at Christmas , has been building since April and could reach the record heights set in 1982 / 83 if current trends continue . 
that record El Nino caused disasters which inflicted damage worth an estimated 15 billion pounds ( $ 24.5 billion ) at the time , the Meteorological Office said . 
&quot; In some places temperatures are five or six degrees Celsius above normal , which is very unusual , &quot; climate monitoring head David Parker said in a statement . 
Ocean temperatures have a dramatic impact on atmospheric conditions , so changes of just a few degrees can severely disrupt weather patterns . 
EL Ninos , part of a natural cycle between warm and cold water periods , normally occur ever three to five years and last for about 12 months , but the current pattern began building earlier than normal . 
they have profound consequences on agriculture and fishing regions throughout the southern hemisphere , which reverberate through global commodity markets . 
countries surrounding the Pacific Ocean are most severely affected . 
current flooding that has devastated central Europe was probably only a coincidence and not related to the developing El Nino , said Mike Davey , head of tropical modelling at the Meteorological Office . 
it has , however , already been blamed in June for the worst flooding in Chile in a decade that killed 17 people , forced 60,000 to flee their homes and seriously damaged agriculture and infrastructure . 
Peru has already declared nine of the country &apos;s 24 regions in a state of emergency and earmarked $ 19 million for anti-El Nino preparations . 
Australia warned on Thursday that a severe drought could badly affect its economy and force a possible downward revision in gross domestic product forecasts by one to 1.5 percent . 
a drought and massive bush fires afflicted the country following the 1982 / 83 El Nino . 
but Davey said the world had much better forewarning of the current El Nino than in previous years . 
&quot; It &apos;s hard to say if it might be worse , but because we have more of a warning countries are much better prepared to limit the damage , &quot; told Reuters . 
the international scientific community has improved its monitoring capabilities by setting up a network of more than 30 moorings along the equator in the tropical Pacific that monitor water temperatures , winds and conditions below the ocean surface . 
&quot; Really all we can at the moment do is wait and see , &quot; he said .
