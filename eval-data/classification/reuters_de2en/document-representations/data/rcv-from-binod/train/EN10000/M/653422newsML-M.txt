U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Thursday were seen steady to $ 0.50 per cwt higher , buoyed by outlooks for moderate packer demand and continued light marketings , livestock dealers said . 
Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota hog receipts Tuesday were 100,000 head , below the estimate of 105,000 , USDA reported . 
estimates for Wednesday were at 105,000 head , but several dealers said they were not sure if receipts were large enough to match the estimate . 
Interior Iowa / southern Minnesota top prices for hogs delivered to the plant were seen $ 59.00 to $ 59.50 . 
Illinois top price for hogs at the plant was seen at $ 59.00 and Indiana / Ohio top prices were also expected at $ 59.00 , the dealers said . 
although hog supplies were not large enough to meet moderate demand , packers were slaughtering 3.6 percent more than last week , which was weighing on pork prices , market sources said . 
hog slaughter Wednesday was estimated at 333,000 head , which brought the week to date number to 976,000 , compared with 942,000 a week ago and 951,000 a year ago , USDA reported .
