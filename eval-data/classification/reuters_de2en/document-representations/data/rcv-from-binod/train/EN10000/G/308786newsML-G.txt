Americans on a dangerous rescue mission left a cannister of plutonium , a key ingredient of nuclear weapons , in Vietnam as the communists marched to victory in 1975 , the Energy Department disclosed on Wednesday . 
releasing once-secret documents on the 80 grams ( about three ounces ) of missing plutonium , the department said U.S. officials were working with the International Atomic Energy Agency to verify its status &quot; and take any necessary action . 
&quot; The volume of plutonium and circumstances involved do not give rise to special proliferation concerns , &quot; it said in a statement at a news conference marking the declassification of more than 6,500 films chronicling the atomic age . 
the statement said Vietnam , a signatory to the treaty aimed at curbing the spread of nuclear weapons and a member of the Vienna-based IAEA , had been &quot; responsive &quot; to U.S. State Department inquiries about the plutonium , which Energy Secretary Hazel O &apos;Leary said was &quot; below weapons grade . 
the United States sent the plutonium to the South Vietnamese government in 1962 for use in a research reactor in the central highlands resort city of Dalat under the &quot; Atoms for Peace &quot; programme , an Energy Department fact sheet said . 
it said the material apparently was still at Dalat , where Vietnam reactivated the U.S.-supplied reactor with help from the former Soviet Union , which provided enriched uranium fuel . 
the IAEA , a United Nations agency , has said it has a record of a plutonium source in Vietnam . 
the IAEA plans to inspect the Dalat facility next month to check whether the source on its records matches the one left behind by the United States at war &apos;s end , the fact sheet said . 
the newly declassified documents showed that two U.S. volunteers on a James Bond-style cloak-and-dagger mission had reached Dalat in late March 1975 to disassemble the training reactor and retrieve the plutonium . 
at that time Dalat was encircled on three sides by Viet Cong guerrillas and North Vietnamese regular forces . 
toiling as sniper bullets ricocheted through the reactor area , the pair mistakenly retrieved a similarly sealed radioactive source , leaving the stainless steel-clad container with the plutonium behind , the account said . 
an Energy Department memorandum identified the pair , who received commendations for wartime valour , as Wally Hendrickson and John Horan , both of the department &apos;s Idaho operations office . 
they could not immediately be reached for comment . 
&quot; At the volunteers &apos; request , the mission to retrieve the fule was scheduled for Easter Sunday with the thought that the Viet Cong would believe any American in the country would be observing the holiday , &quot; the account said . 
but during the process of retrieving , packaging and labeling the uranium fuel and plutonium , &quot; nearby combat was occurring and sniper bullets were hitting the reactor area . 
by the evening of April 1 , Hendrickson and Horan were being airlifted back to Saigon with what they thought was the plutonium . 
in fact , the cannister proved to contain an alloy of polonium and beryllium . 
Dalat fell to the Viet Cong that night . 
the containers were flown from Tan Son Nhut airport to Clark Air Base in the Phillipines , escorted by one of the volunteers , en route to temporary storage on Johnston atoll in the Pacific . 
o &apos;Leary said the episode , including updating the official U.S. inventory of plutonium and records on file with the IAEA , came to light during routine declassification review under government-wide rules established by President Bill Clinton .
