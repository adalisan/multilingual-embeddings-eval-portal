Jakarta stocks are seen flat on Monday after the start of the general election campaign , while the market focus is seen on finance firm Multidana which makes its debut today , brokers said . 
&quot; Local speculators are likely to shift their focus to Multidana as the issue is scheduled to be listed today and after market talk that the issue was oversubscribed during its IPO , &quot; one broker said . 
brokers said small property firms Elang realty and Suryamas which dominated trading last week , were unlikely to do so this week . 
&quot; speculators focused on these firms last week because there was no fresh news . 
there was no new listing either , &quot; the broker said . 
brokers said foreign players were likely to stay on the sidelines despite a peaceful start on Sunday to the election campaign for the May 29 vote and the fall on Wall Street on Friday . 
on Friday , the Jakarta composite index eased 0.51 points , or 0.08 percent , to close at 652.48 points .

it is purely speculation , &quot; another broker said . 
Elang rose 150 rupiah to 1,625 rupiah , with some 36 million shares traded . 
brokers said trading was dominated by local players as foreign investors were mostly sidelined despite a peaceful start on Sunday to the general election campaign for the May 29 vote .
