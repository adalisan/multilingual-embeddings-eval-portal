CSCE cocoa futures retreated from fresh contract highs set across-the-board to finish flat to lower in volatile trading on Wednesday , pressured by an afternoon round of speculative profit-taking , trading sources said . 
speculative buying drove the most-active May to a new high of $ 1,532 a tonne earlier but light scale-up selling by the trade and origin hedging reversed momentum and sparked a late-session bout of profit-taking , they said . 
may delivery slipped $ 8 on the day , to close at $ 1,504 , after ranging from $ 1,532 to $ 1,493 . 
Second-month July fell $ 3 , to $ 1,537 , while the outer months ended unchanged to $ 1 weaker . 
cocoa prices headed higher at the outset , as speculators followed through on Tuesday &apos;s explosive rally to over 2-1 / 2 year highs . 
traders said May &apos;s break out of the pennant formation on Tuesday sparked further chart-inspired buying . 
although May &apos;s first attempt to hit a new lifetime high was thwarted , traders said the spot contract &apos;s ability to hold support at $ 1,490 prompted another speculative-led rally . 
despite today &apos;s weak close , traders said the market appeared poised to rack up further gains . 
&quot; technically , the picture looks so strong , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; There is a big spec long position and they are actually willing to defend it . 
he estimated the speculators ( non-commercial plus non-reportable ) had increased their net long position to some 30,000 lots . 
the latest CFTC Commitment of Traders data , which showed speculators were net long 24,763 lots as of March 25 . 
&quot; The market is going to continue to be volatile , &quot; another trader said . 
&quot; The amount of specs in the market these days makes you more aware of the potential for specs to take this market over . 
technically , traders pegged May resistance at $ 1,543 , while support was seen at $ 1,490 , then $ 1,475 . 
traders and analysts agreed there was little fundamental reason for the market &apos;s recent upswing . 
&quot; All the news that has come out has been bearish , &quot; said Rich Wistisen , an analyst with commodity Information in Orem , Utah . 
&quot; The Ivory Coast crop is likely to be over 1.1 million ( tonnes ) and the grinds are not likely to be bullish . 
European first quarter cocoa grindings due in the next week or two could come in lower compared to 1996 first quarter data , analysts in Amsterdam said Wednesday . 
however , they added the figures may not accurately reflect consumption , which was steady to higher . 
volume on the exchange reached an estimated 12,475 lots , down from Tuesday &apos;s official tally of 18,953 lots .
