liquidity in India is expected to tighten by December after easing in the short-term , securities firm Crosby Ltd said on Wednesday . 
&quot; liquidity is likely to remain easy in the next three months as a temporary industrial slowing ( down ) will hold back growth in credit creation , &quot; Crosby analyst Sanjeev Sanyal said in a report . 
he said this would combine with lower-than-expected inflation to allow a cut in short-term interest rates of 50 basis points . 
Crosby said it had revised its forecast of Indian inflation to an average of 7.6 percent in financial 1996 / 97 ( April-March ) against an earlier nine percent forecast . 
&quot; However long-term interest rates will not fall as long-term expectations are still high and a structural scarcity of capital in India will keep liquidity tight in the long run . 
Sanyal said industrial production was expected to revive in the second half of 1996 / 97 . 
this would combine with government borrowing to increase the demand for funds , he said . 
&quot; This , in turn , will tighten liquidity by December .
