French President Jacques Chirac , who dissolved parliament and called an early election on Monday , would not resign if the opposition won but would be prepared to share power with a left-wing government if his centre-right coalition lost , sources close to him said . 
they said Chirac was aware he was taking a calculated risk by bringing forward the vote due next March and planned to get involved personally in the campaign by setting out the kind of French society he wanted to see . 
Chirac &apos;s predecessor , the late Socialist Francois Mitterrand , twice shared power with conservative governments in 1986-88 and 1993-95 after the left lost parliamentary elections . 
the sources said Chirac telephoned opposition Socialist leader Lionel Jospin and Communist leader Robert Hue as a courtesy to inform them of his intentions a few hours before announcing the dissolution of the National Assembly . 
they said the president had been concerned that if he had allowed the electoral calendar to run its normal course , organised sectional interests would have overwhelmed the national interest . 
the government has faced a series of strikes by public sector workers , doctors , medical students , truck drivers and airline staff in defence of &quot; acquired rights &quot; or against attempts to make them share the cost of welfare austerity . 
if the goverment were re-elected , even with a reduced majority , Chirac would have his hands free until the end of his seven-year term in 2002 to pursue more market-oriented reforms and closer European integration , the sources said .
