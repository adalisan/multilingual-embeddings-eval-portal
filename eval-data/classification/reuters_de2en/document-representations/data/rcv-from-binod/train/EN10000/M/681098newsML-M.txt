September T-bonds will consolidate on Monday after Friday &apos;s spike higher , bumping into trendline resistance at 112-20 , technical analysts said . 
consistently strong buying power will continue to underpin the market with support at 111-26 seen holding , they added . 
&quot; There &apos;s evidence of consistent buying power in treasuries but I &apos;d be fairly cautious as the market is up against a sloping resistance line , &quot; said Elli Gifford , an independent technical analyst near Cambridge . 
she put resistance at 112-20 then 113-00 . 
if the market does break through there , the February 18 high at 113-09 would act as a barrier , Gifford added . 
by 0856 GMT , September T-bonds were down 3 / 32 at 112-14 after breaking through resistance on Friday to reach 112-24 . 
Gerry Celaya , senior technical analyst at American Express Bank in London expected the market to consolidate its sharp gains . 
&quot; It &apos;s hard to get bearish right now but Friday &apos;s session could have been pretty significant . 
we had a high of 112-24 and we didn &apos;t follow up too much on it , &quot; he said . 
on the upside he put critical resistance at 112-24 , followed by 113-09 then 114-00 . 
on the downside , Gifford said the market would find a band of support at 112-08 , the June 18 high , to 111-26 , the June 19 low . 
&quot; Despite the fact it is marginally overbought , I suspect that will hold , &quot; she said . 
Celaya also put support at 111-26 , then 111-17 -- a double low from last week . 
below there , although unlikely , support would come in at 111-08 / 09 , lows in mid-June , he said .
