the United States on Friday criticised China &apos;s tactics during the U.N. Human Rights Commission saying that no country , especially a Security Council member , could put itself above the forum &apos;s scrutiny . 
but Nancy Rubin , head of the U.S. delegation , said in a statement the &quot; global spotlight shone longer , more intensely and more critically on China &apos;s performance this year than in the past &quot; . 
for the seventh year in a row , China averted censure by introducing a &quot; no-action motion &quot; to silence all debate on alleged repression and Western concern for political prisoners . 
&quot; With the exception of China &apos;s no action motion , this has been a positive , active and successful Commission , &quot; Rubin said . 
&quot; The no action vote was disappointing . 
it strikes at the heart of the Commission &apos;s effectiveness and threatens its many achievements . 
no nation , particularly a Security Council member , can put itself above the Commission &apos;s consideration , &quot; she added . 
the main U.N. human rights forum was to end its six-week session , having let China off the hook again , but keen to step up investigations in Africa , especially in Nigeria and Zaire . 
the 53-member body approved a raft of resolutions condemning traditional transgressors , including Burma , Cuba , Iran , Iraq and Israel . 
it sent the toughest message to Indonesia to curb its alleged abuses in East Timor since a 1993 motion . 
for the first time , the Commission urged states to consider abolishing capital punishment . 
it also adopted a resolution calling for a world conference by the year 2001 to combat racism , subject to approval by the General Assembly . 
the human rights group Amnesty International praised the Commission for having confronted Indonesia and Nigeria , but slammed it for ignoring abuses elsewhere : &quot; Once again , major human rights violators including Algeria , China and Turkey escaped scrutiny by the U.N. primary human rights body . 
Amnesty accused some states who backed away from co-sponsoring a Western resolution on China of having bowed to commercial interests . 
Beijing then quashed Denmark &apos;s motion . 
&quot; France &apos;s decision to block European Union consensus on China earned it applause from the Chinese government and confirmation of lucrative business contracts , &quot; Amnesty said . 
&quot; With millions of dollars on the line , any commitment to human rights principles just faded away . 
&quot; For now , China has suppressed Commission scrutiny . 
this diplomatic victory was achieved through threats and bullying tactics and because countries like Australia , Canada , France , Gernmany , Greece , Italy and Spain put business before human rights , &quot; the group added . 
some 2,000 delegates heard more than 1,100 speeches and adopted 75 resolutions during the six-week session , according to Ralph Zacklin , acting U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights . 
&quot; At the end of the day , any state is concerned about what the rest of the world thinks about its human right practices , &quot; he told a final news conference . 
turning to Africa &apos;s Great Lakes region , Amnesty said the Commission was &quot; almost irrelevant &quot; in the face of &quot; some of the worst human rights abuses since the Second World War &quot; . 
yet the forum adopted a resolution urging Zaire &apos;s rebels and the government to support a U.N. investigation into alleged massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees and civilians in the east . 
Roberto Garreton , U.N. human rights investigator for Zaire , has accused the Tutsi-dominated rebels of massacring thousands of civilians and Rwandan Hutu refugees since December . 
the resolution asked Garreton and the U.N. investigator on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions to investigate the massacres and report to the General Assembly by June 30 . 
the Commission appointed its first investigator into alleged arbitrary detentions and executions in Nigeria . 
the resolution called on Lagos to &quot; release all prisoners , trade union leaders , human rights advocates and journalists currently detained &quot; .
