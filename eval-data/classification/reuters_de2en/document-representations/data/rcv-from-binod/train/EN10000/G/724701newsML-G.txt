Philippine airport police have seized five crates of foreign-made assault rifles imported from France by an unnamed Filipino buyer , airport sources said on Sunday . 
the crates contained AK-47 and Armalite rifles which were originally brought by ship to Cebu city in central Philippines and flown by a chartered private plane to the Manila airport last Friday , when police impounded them . 
an aviation official , who asked not to be identified , said airport police had taken custody of the arms but refused to say who imported them and from whom and for what purpose . 
the importation appeared to have no government clearance , the official said .
