with Republicans attacking his ethics and challenger Bob Dole hoping to land some solid punches in their final debate , President Bill Clinton is gearing up for the jabs that come with &quot; election time . 
with Tuesday marking the last full day of preparations for his final televised debate on Wednesday night with Dole in San Diego , Clinton planned practice sessions with his senior campaign advisers and White House confidants in a hotel conference room . 
at the 9 p.m. EDT ( 0100 GMT ) debate , the Democratic and Republican candidates will field questions for 90 minutes from an audience of voters who say they remain undecided on their choice for president . 
Clinton advisers say they expect the president will face questions about his character and ethical standards -- in part because of the recently orchestrated Republican assaults on him . 
&quot; This may turn nasty , &quot; a senior campaign official said . 
&quot; We &apos;re certainly getting ready for it . 
Clinton has tried to avoid responding to the Republican barrage , brushing aside reporters &apos; questions about the attacks , particularly those of Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich , a long-time political nemesis . 
&quot; It &apos;s election time , &quot; Clinton said on Monday to explain the decision to attack his character as a way to overcome his double-digit lead in most public opinion polls . 
&quot; I &apos;m preparing to do my debate , to answer whatever questions may be asked , &quot; said , adding that &quot; whatever they ask , I &apos;ll do my best to answer . 
the first two debates , the first between Clinton and Dole and the second involving vice presidential contenders Al Gore and Jack Kemp , for the most part avoided personal attacks . 
they also failed to have any significant impact on the lead Clinton has enjoyed for months . 
&quot; Sen. Dole will decide his strategy and I will decide mine , and we &apos;ll see what the people have to say afterwards , &quot; Clinton said . 
the Clinton camp has been bracing for a negative onslaught heading into the final weeks before the Nov . 5 election , with Dole himself rachetting up the rhetoric . 
dole demanded on Monday in Kansas City that Clinton answer questions about his links to Asian businessmen and their contributions to Democratic party coffers . 
&quot; We &apos;re going to raise the questions every day until the president &apos;s properly responded , &quot; Dole said . 
earlier , as a rally , he promised to be tougher with Clinton when they debate again . 
Clinton &apos;s ties to Indonesian James Riady have been fiercely attacked by Republicans in recent days , who suspect Riady &apos;s influence is behind big contributions to the Democratic Party from individuals with links to an Indonesian financial conglomerate , the Lippo Group . 
just how aggressive Dole should be in the final debate -- likely to be watched by some 70 million Americans -- has been a subject of disagreement among his strategists . 
in 1976 , when Dole was the Republican vice presidential nominee , his confrontational style contributed to incumbent President Gerald Ford &apos;s defeat at the hands of Democrat Jimmy Carter . 
dole has spent much of the campaign season trying to soften the lingering image of him as a &quot; hatchet man , &quot; and at least some of his advisers have argued against him leading the attack on Clinton . 
Republicans have been frustrated by the fact that character has not become an issue in their bid to unseat Clinton , who has been hounded by accusations of marital infidelity and questions about his Whitewater land development venture when he was governor of Arkansas .
