Paper Brent continued to trade at lower levels on Friday while the North Sea wet market languished under pressure from unsold late March and early April Brent cargoes , traders said . 
three Brents due to load April 5-9 were kept by BP ahead of the five o &apos;clock deadline , adding to the seven already in the hands of the British major that are due to load in the first six days of the month . 
traders heard talk of a Brent done confidentially and Dated-related but it was not clear whether it was one of the two late March cargoes reportedly still available . 
&quot; It &apos;s very dead . 
some people are going home early , &quot; one wet market trader said . 
&quot; It &apos;s as quiet as the grave , &quot; said another . 
shipping brokers said Glencore provisionally fixed the ULCC Jahre Pollux to take 350,000 tonnes of Brent to the U.S. in late March or early April but traders doubted the arbitrage was open . 
the outright price softened in later futures trade , with May IPE down 11 cents at $ 20.07 a barrel . 
Paper was also softer . 
on CFDs , next week &apos;s dates four cents lower at May -50 cents after trading four times at -51 cents before lunch . 
the following week traded at May -40 cents , down three cents from Thursday . 
Intermonth paper spreads lost further ground . 
may June traded at + 7 and + 6 cents , after achieving + 10 cents . 
other North Sea grades were better supported . 
but BP &apos;s maintenance of run cuts at Rotterdam , where Texaco restored throughput on Thursday , could block further gains . 
the West African crude market continued its tentative recovery from March lows as sales of April barrels gathered pace , traders said .
