Hong Kong academics waded into a controversy over planned curbs on civil liberties on Tuesday , saying proposed limits on political groups and demonstrations threatened basic freedoms . 
more than 150 scholars signed a statement opposing plans by future leader Tung Chee-hwa to ban foreign funding for political groups and require police approval for protests after Hong Kong returns to Chinese rule on July 1 , the academics said . 
the proposed rules on political groups posed a great threat to the freedom of association , their interpretation of foreign meddling was seriously flawed and too much interpretation was left to authorities , they said in a statement . 
&quot; This is tantamount to opening the door to abuse in the future , &quot; the statement said . 
the academics were the latest Hong Kong group to enter a furious debate over legal changes proposed earlier this month by Tung , who says they are needed to preserve stability after 156 years of British rule end at midnight on June 30 . 
the new laws are intended to take the place of parts of Hong Kong &apos;s Public Order and Societies ordinances that have been opposed by China &apos;s National People &apos;s Congress , or parliament . 
Tung should rethink his plans or risk further losing credibility among Hong Kong residents , some of whom were already calling him Beijing &apos;s &quot; rubber stamp &quot; , said sing Ming , assistant professor of public and social administration at the City University . 
many groups had vowed to launch civil disobedience campaigns if the proposals were not revised , raising the spectre of grave political trouble ahead for both Hong Kong and its Beijing-backed future leader , sing said . 
&quot; If some of them are arrested and that triggers off large-scale protests and ... that leads to further suppression , I don &apos;t think that will be good for Hong Kong , &quot; he said . 
a three-week public consultation period for the proposed legal changes have prompted a flurry of protests from lawyers , pro-democracy activists and human rights campaigners as well as expressions of support from some unions and social groups .
