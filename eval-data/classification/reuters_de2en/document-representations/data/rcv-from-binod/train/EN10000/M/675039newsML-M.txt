German shares advanced strongly in bourse trade on Thursday , but dealers said the market was driven predominantly by technical factors rather than by any new data moving the market . 
derivative products drove the market ahead of Friday &apos;s &quot; triple-witching &quot; , which sees the expiry of DAX index options , DAX futures and stock options and traditionally brings volatility into the market . 
&quot; This market is more technical than fundamental at the moment ahead of the triple witching , and it &apos;s causing movements right across Europe , not just in Germany , &quot; said a Frankfurt trader . 
derivatives buying lifted Volkswagen AG in particular early on , with the share up 33.2 marks at 1,253 marks , the dealer said . 
the carmaker was also expected to report figures at its annual general meeting in Hamburg . 
technical factors also drove airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG higher , rising 5.31 percent to 34.30 marks . 
shares in retailer Karstadt fell against the trend by 4.13 percent to 627 marks , after disappointing five month figures . 
&quot; There isn &apos;t really any news out there -- it &apos;s all derivatives-driven . 
there is a lot of progressive buying coming from the U.S. , and demand exceeds supply in this market , &quot; the trader said .
