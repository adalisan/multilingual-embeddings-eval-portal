an astrologer detained for predicting the demise of Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera was released on Thursday and said his forecast had not been politically motivated . 
&quot; It seems that among the taboo subjects is the health or mortality of the president , &quot; Jose Bernardo Gomez told Reuters in a brief telephone interview after his release . 
Interior Minister Jose Guillermo Andueza said on Wednesday the secret police were investigating the &quot; political implications &quot; of the astrologer &apos;s prediction . 
&quot; It &apos;s a purely astrological prediction : he ( Caldera ) has Pluto ascending , Uranus on top of the sun , Mars reversing over his birth moon and an eclipse over the planet Quiron , &quot; Gomez said after spending two days in prison . 
Gomez said he was kept in a small room with no bed , but insisted he was treated cordially . 
the astrologer had told a conference on Oct . 12 that &quot; Caldera will not pass 1997 . 
&quot; Caldera , whose second presidential term ends in 1999 , will be 81 in January . 
Gomez is president of Venezuela &apos;s astrologers association and according to followers is one of the best in his field . 
among his celebrated predictions was Caldera &apos;s surprise electoral triumph in 1993 .
