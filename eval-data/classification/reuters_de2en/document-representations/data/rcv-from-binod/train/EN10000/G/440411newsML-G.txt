Canada announced on Wednesday it was suspending operations at its embassy in Lagos because of what it said was the failure of the Nigerian government to ensure the safety of its diplomats . 
it said in a statement that repeated security assessments had determined there was an unacceptable level of risk at the mission , formally called its high commission . 
&quot; Canadian officials at the High Commission have not been given the security assurances by the Nigerians that we are guaranteed in the Vienna Convention , &quot; Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in the statement . 
&quot; It is the desire of Canada that the Nigerian government ensure that this matter be resolved quickly so that the High Commission can resume normal operations as soon as possible . 
though bilateral relations have been tense because of Canadian concerns over Nigerian human rights violations , the statement emphasized that this did not mean that diplomatic relations had been broken . 
a spokeswoman said the move had nothing to do with the Nigerian government &apos;s announcement on Wednesday that it had charged Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka and 11 others with treason over recent bomb blasts . 
the statement said the embassy had been without a security officer since December , and efforts by Canada to send a replacement had been &quot; blocked by the failure of the Nigerian government to issue a visa for this person . 
&quot; Nigerian officials have also made unfounded allegations that Canada has supported recent acts of violence in Nigeria . 
the combination of these allegations with the hindering of our normal staffing has made it impossible to conduct routine activities in Lagos , &quot; it added . 
it said the consular affairs would be managed by the U.S. embassy out of the former Canadian chancery location in Lagos , while other activities such as visa services would be run out of the Canadian embassy in Ghana . 
the acting high commissioner and other Canadian officials have already returned to Canada , the statement added .
