Tokyo naphtha prices were firmer on Tuesday , supported by steady crude prices and a well-balanced supply / demand situation in prompt months , traders said . 
Open-spec naphtha first-half April was notionally assessed at $ 237.00 / 238.00 per tonne , against $ 235.00 / 237.50 on Monday . 
Second-half April was assessed at $ 234.50 / 236.00 . 
Intermonth spreads were barely changed with the one-month spread from first-half April at about $ 4.50 / 5.50 . 
in the wet market , two Japanese firms and one South Korean firm are believed to be looking for one March cargo each , traders said . 
the high premium levels of recent March delivery deals , ranging from about $ 5.00 to $ 9.50 above the mean of Singapore quotes , are fanning the bullish sentiment , traders said . 
in the jet kerosene market , traders said demand is currently slow and any buying would hinge on the weather . 
there were rumours of a Japanese refiner seeking an early March cargo at around $ 2.40 above Singapore quotes on a C and F basis , but they could not be confirmed . 
traders of low-sulphur waxy residue said they estimated about 1.4 million barrels of Indonesia &apos;s February allocation had been committed to Japan .
