EURO.NM , a pan-European market for high-growth stocks , aims to have as many as 500 companies listed in the next five years , according to the head of the Paris stock exchange , a partner in the venture . 
&quot; Our prospects are very bright , &quot; Jean-Francois Theodore , chairman of the Paris bourse , told reporters at the National Press Club here . 
&quot; Without being overambitious , we forecast that within the next five years 400 to 500 companies will be listed on the EURO.NM network . 
EURO.NM currently has 34 listed companies . 
its members include the Paris Exchange &apos;s Nouveau Marche , Germany &apos;s Neuer Markt , Amsterdam &apos;s NMAX . 
and Brussels &apos; EURO.NM Belgium . 
all four of the markets belonging to the network have been fully operational since the end of March . 
Theodore said the move to a single European currency would be &quot; a plus &quot; for EURO.NM. 
but he said the market &apos;s business plan for growth is based largely on the caliber of the companies that list . 
calling himself &quot; a Europtimist by faith and by reason , &quot; he expressed confidence that Europe &apos;s unification will occur . 
but I do have a strong feeling as a European citizen and entrepreneur that EMU will happen on time &quot; on January 1 , 1999 .
