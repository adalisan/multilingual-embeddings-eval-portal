Romania &apos;s leu currency ended Tuesday little changed with banks &apos; quotes showing a wide range from 6,000 / 100 to 7,500 / 8,000 to the dollar . 
most dealers said they had been confused by the &quot; wild &quot; range offered in early trading . 
&quot; One operator gave me an unbelievable huge spread of 5,700 / 9,000 , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; It &apos;s very difficult to say which was the market rate today . 
but I can tell you that there was one interbank deal struck below 6,000 at noon . 
another trader said he believed the average rate amounted to some 6,400 against the dollar during early hours and it closed almost unchanged at around 6,200 . 
&quot; Interbank trading livened up by noon , but quotes were artificial and nobody could tell whether they have any economic support , &quot; a trader said . 
latest central bank data put interbank volume at $ 3.95 million on Monday , down from $ 6.96 million last Friday . 
some dealers said a &quot; more realistic &quot; level for the leu would be near 7,500 / 8,000 to the dollar but they declined to forecast the leu &apos;s trend in the coming days . 
dealers said the money market remained stalled and faced by an acute leu shortage , with overnight rates hovering around 520 percent . 
Leu-dollar retail rates idled between 7,000 / 8,000 and 7,300 / 8000 .
