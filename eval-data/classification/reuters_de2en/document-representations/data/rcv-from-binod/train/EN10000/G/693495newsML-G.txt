the United Nations refugee agency said on Friday it would begin its first voluntary repatriation of Congolese refugees in the Great Lakes region at the weekend . 
a group of 300 returnees among the nearly 100,000 Congolese refugees who fled fighting in the former Zaire for Tanzania will be the first out of 5,000 due to return over the next six weeks . 
they will leave camps in the Kigoma region on Saturday and will travel by ferry on Sunday across Lake Tanganyika . 
they are due to arrive on Monday in the Democratic Republic of Congo . 
&quot; Most of these returnees are former civil servants , businessmen and shopkeepers in Uvira , &quot; Fernando del Mundo , spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , told a news briefing . 
&quot; The return was scheduled after a newly opened UNHCR office in Uvira determined that it is safe for these Congolese to return , &quot; he added . 
local authorities had pledged that returnees will be allowed to recover property left behind following the outbreak of fighting between government troops and rebels loyal to Laurent Kabila in Uvira last October , according to the spokesman . 
there are some 15,000 Congolese refugees in Tanzania , and some 9,000 registered in the Central African Republic , according to the Geneva-based agency . 
&quot; Reports from the Central African Republic indicate that there are up to 50,000 Congolese there , but we have been unable to confirm these figures , &quot; del Mundo said . 
the agency had also received reports of the presence of several thousand refugees in Angola , Zambia and Uganda , he said .
