the number of Aborigines dying in Australia &apos;s jails is growing as state governments fail to fully implement steps urged to curb such deaths , a report said on Tuesday . 
aboriginal deaths in custody jumped 46 percent to 19 in the year to June 30 , 1996 , from 13 in the previous 12 months , while non-Aboriginal deaths fell 11 percent to 56 , Canberra &apos;s annual report on Aboriginal deaths in custody found . 
it was the highest number of Aboriginal deaths since complete records began to be kept in 1990 / 91 . 
aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron called the death rate alarming and reaffirmed the government &apos;s commitment to a national summit , scheduled for May , to tackle the high rate of jailing and deaths in custody for native Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders . 
&quot; These figures are alarming and raise very great concerns amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander communities and organisations around Australia as families and relatives of the victims desperately seek answers to these untimely and sometimes mysterious deaths , &quot; he said in the report . 
the report noted that the increase in deaths comes at a time when total deaths in custody were falling . 
the report said six of the 19 deaths were suicides , five were the result of illnesses , and eight stemmed from injuries sustained by Aborigines during or after their arrest , mostly in road accidents following police pursuits . 
the national government launched a special inquiry , known as a royal commission , into Aboriginal deaths in custody in the late 1980s . 
the inquiry &apos;s findings in 1991 said Aborigines were far more likely to die in prison cells and jails than white Australians , and made scores of recommendations aimed at reducing the death rate . 
Australia &apos;s state governments run their own prisons and police forces and Tuesday &apos;s report criticised the regional administrations for failing to act fully on the 1991 recommendations . 
&quot; Once again , this suggests that key recommendations of the royal commission concerned with minimising the number of people held in prison and providing a high quality of care for those in prison are either not being fully implemented or , when they are , are not operating effectively , &quot; the annual report said . 
aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders account for less than two percent of Australia &apos;s 18 million people , but are almost 17 times more likely to be jailed than whites . 
Tuesday &apos;s report also found the high proportion of Aborigines in jails was increasing around the country , despite the 1991 inquiry &apos;s finding that excessive arrest and imprisonment rates , often for minor offences such as public drunkenness , were a key factor in the high rate of deaths in custody .
