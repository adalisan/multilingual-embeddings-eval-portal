a U.K. holiday thinned trade on European crude oil markets but those continental traders in the office on Monday said the tone remained weak following Friday &apos;s selloff . 
IPE Brent crude closed some 30 cents down on Friday as late profit-takers sold heavily into the close . 
dull refiner buyer interest amid poor profit margins and ample supplies of Brent , Russian and North Afrcan grades also put pressure on physical differentials . 
by Monday afternoon , traders assessed October Brent paper at $ 20.35 / $ 20.40 , slightly down from Friday &apos;s IPE close of $ 20.41 . 
dated Brent was assessed at 15-20 cents a barrel under September paper , down 10 cents from Friday &apos;s high point , following a trade as low as -20 cents late Friday between a U.K. major and a trading company for a September 7-9 cargo . 
but some traders said the low price was the result of manipulation of dated Brent values to offset CFD positions . 
this week &apos;s CFDs were talked as low as September -25 cents late Friday . 
MED traders noted that while simple refiner margins have improved by 50 cents a barrel from Tuesday to Friday , they are far from good . 
&quot; We are still looking toward perhaps cutting runs if we do not see a bigger improvement . 
there is still no reason to increase our crude oil buying , &quot; said a trader at one of the Med &apos;s largest refiners . 
last week , a handful of European refiners cut runs which combined with heavy autumn refinery maintenance work threatens to dull crude buying interest even further .
