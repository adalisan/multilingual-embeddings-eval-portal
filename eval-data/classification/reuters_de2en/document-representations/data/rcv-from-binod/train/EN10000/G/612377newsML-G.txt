moderate former culture minister Mohammad Khatami took an early lead and looked headed for an upset victory in Iran &apos;s presidential election on Saturday after first results of Friday &apos;s ballot were announced . 
Khatami , considered a moderate compared with most of the conservative Shi &apos;ite Moslem clergymen who run the Islamic republic , won two out of three of nearly nine million votes counted overnight . 
an official in charge of the Interior Ministry &apos;s election headquarters said Khatami won 6,049,834 of the 8,989,065 votes counted up to 8 : 00 a.m. ( 0330 GMT ) . 
his main rival , parliament speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri who had been widely expected to become Iran &apos;s next president , won only 2,498,316 votes . 
two minor candidates won fewer than 200,000 votes apiece . 
analysts said if the trend of voting continued , the result would be the biggest political upset in the history of Iran &apos;s 18-year-old revolution . 
but with 33 million people aged 15 and over eligible to vote , it remained to be seen if Khatami would hang on to his lead and head for a landslide or see it eroded by rural support for Nateq-Nouri . 
Nateq-Nouri is a traditionalist who enjoys the backing of influential groups of conservative mullahs and merchants . 
he was considered the establishment candidate and was stronger in outlying rural areas , where vote counting was likely to take longer than in the cities . 
the Interior Ministry official , Alireza Tabesh , said the turnout in Friday &apos;s ballot , which was twice extended for a total of four additional hours because of queues of people waiting to cast their votes , was &quot; unprecedentedly heavy &quot; . 
the election was to choose a successor to President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who must step down in August after serving the maximum two four-year terms allowed by law . 
campaigning for the election was the fiercest political battle between conservative clerics and moderates since fundamentalist Shi &apos;ites toppled the pro-American Shah in the 1979 revolution . 
both Khatami and Nateq-Nouri are 54-year-old middle-ranking clergymen . 
during the 12-day election campaign Khatami , a descendant of Islam &apos;s founder Prophet Mohammad , attracted a rainbow coalition of women , youths and intellectuals seeking a more relaxed application of Islamic mores . 
many of his supporters see him as a moderate compared with the conservatives who control parliament and some of Iran &apos;s state institutions . 
all four candidates were screened by a conservative group of senior clergy and lawyers before being allowed to run . 
the group rejected 234 other candidates for failing to match up to Islamic revolutionary ideals . 
Iran &apos;s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who outranks the president , tacitly supported Nateq-Nouri and urged voters to choose the &quot; best qualified &quot; candidate . 
he said electors would vote for someone who could &quot; stand against America and those who want to impose their will on our nation &quot; .
