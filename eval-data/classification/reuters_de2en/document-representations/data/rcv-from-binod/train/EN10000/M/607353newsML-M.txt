Taiwan &apos;s state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp ( CPC ) has bought a second cargo of 95-octane reformate from its tender which closed May 19 . 
on Tuesday , traders said CPC acquired 250,000 barrels at $ 24.92 per barrel , cost-and-freight ( c-and-f ) Taiwan for delivery July 1-15 . 
but CPC sources said on Thursday the company bought a second cargo at $ 25.20 , c-and-f June 21-30 . 
the purchases were from separate sellers and are for delivery to Keelung or Taichung . 
the tender closed May 19 and was valid for two days . 
&quot; They were very cheap numbers , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; That &apos;s why they have bought more . 
traders had expected the latest awards to be higher than CPC &apos;s last reformate tender because of rising crude values . 
last time , CPC awarded two June 11-30 cargoes at around $ 25.30 per barrel .
