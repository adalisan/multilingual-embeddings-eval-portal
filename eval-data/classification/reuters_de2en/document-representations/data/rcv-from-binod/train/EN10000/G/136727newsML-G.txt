Colombia &apos;s disgraced attorney general was arrested again on Tuesday , less than a week after the Supreme Court ordered his dismissal because of criminal charges including abuse of power and drug corruption , judicial sources said . 
it was the second time this year that Orlando Vasquez Velasquez , who was confined at a secret police facility known as Arquimindia on the northern outskirts of the capital at about 4 p.m. local time ( 2100 GMT ) , was jailed because of his alleged links to Colombia &apos;s powerful drug barons . 
Vasquez , a former interior minister and ruling Liberal Party senator , was released in August from the same police facility where he was taken on Tuesday . 
he had been held there since early May on charges that he accepted thousands of dollars in payments from leading drug traffickers , both before and after he was sworn in as attorney general in 1994 . 
he has denied any wrongdoing -- and a writ of habeas corpus helped secure his release in August -- but his U.S. travel visa was revoked in April because of his alleged links to drug lords and judicial sources said there was more than enough evidence to justify his re-arrest . 
Guillermo Pallomari , the self-confessed Cali drug cartel treasurer who surrendered to U.S. drug agents in the United States last year , has testified that Vasquez maintained closer ties with the cartel &apos;s jailed leaders than perhaps any other politician in Colombia . 
Vasquez was suspended from office by the Supreme Court shortly before his arrest in May but continued to hold the title of attorney general . 
he was dismissed from office by the Supreme Court last Thursday , however , and barred from holding any public office for the next five years , partly on grounds that he had used &quot; false witnesses &quot; to implicate chief prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso in an illegal land deal . 
more recently Vasquez , who has made no secret of his intense dislike for Valdivieso , had also accused the chief prosecutor of using drug money to back a failed bid for the Senate in 1994 . 
spokesmen for Valdivieso , an anti-drugs crusader and sworn enemy of corrupt politicians , said Tuesday &apos;s warrant for Vasquez &apos;s arrest stemmed from drug-related charges of &quot; illicit enrichment &quot; and not from any personal vendetta . 
police sources said Vasquez , who was accompanied by a former Bogota police chief , handed himself over to authorities at Arquimindia hours after he learned that a warrant for his arrest had been issued on Tuesday morning . 
the warrant was signed by Valdivieso himself and prohibits Vasquez &apos;s possible release on bail .
