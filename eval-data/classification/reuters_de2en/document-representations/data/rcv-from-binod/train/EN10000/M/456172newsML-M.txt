following is the China Interbank offered Rate ( CHIBOR ) for Thursday issued by the official Xinhua news agency on behalf of the People &apos;s Bank of China , the central bank . 
the figures represent weighted averages and not closing prices and are annual percentage rates . 
turnover fell to 3.553 billion yuan from 4.8 billion on Wednesday and the most active one was the 60-day contract . 
traders said the most active buyers were still non-banking financial institutions who borrowed heavily from short-term financial centres in order to buy the day &apos;s two new A share issues . 
but today &apos;s plunge in the A share secondary market prevented the rates from going up further , one local trader said . 
the central bank &apos;s plan to boost the quota for re-discounting of bills by 20 billion yuan this year , which was announced late on Wednesday , would increase China &apos;s money supply and limit the rates in the long-term , a second trader said .
