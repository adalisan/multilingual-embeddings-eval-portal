thousands of people defied a ban on marches in Belarus on Saturday to protest against hardline President Alexander Lukashenko and to mark Constitution Day . 
&quot; Long live Belarus ! 
&quot; they shouted , showing their opposition to plans for a union with neighbouring Russia which President Boris Yeltsin said on Friday could lead to a merger one day . 
they proceeded along the pavements of the main street to a rally due to be held about two km ( a mile and a half ) away . 
authorities have given permission for the rally but specifically banned proceeding through the capital of the former Soviet republic on Russia &apos;s western border . 
opposition officials had vowed to go ahead with the march despite strong-arm tactics used by police on Friday to stop a similar rally taking place on Friday . 
police beat protesters and made about 50 arrests -- including two Germans and two Americans -- at that meeting , attended mostly by young activists . 
Saturday &apos;s rally was led by one of the country &apos;s most respected opposition figures , Semyon Sharetsky , speaker of the former parliament disbanded after Lukashenko won a controversial referendum in November . 
Sharetsky was accompanied at the head of the march by other members of the alternative parliament who refused to join Lukashenko &apos;s new assembly . 
the legitimacy of the November referendum , which Lukashenko won by a landslide and used to rewrite the country &apos;s first constitution , was widely questioned by Western officials . 
there was no sign of the red-and-white post-independence symbols banned by Lukashenko this month as part of moves to crack down on the opposition . 
a loose union of nationalists , intellectuals and students concentrated mostly in Minsk have been promising Lukashenko a &quot; political spring &quot; . 
perhaps fearing scuffles near Lukashenko &apos;s residence , authorities announced renovations would be carried out on the stretch of the main street near the building . 
public transport was stopped from passing that section of the street .
