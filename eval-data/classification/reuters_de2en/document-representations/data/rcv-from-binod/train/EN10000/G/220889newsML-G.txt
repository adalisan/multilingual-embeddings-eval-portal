animal rights activists on Wednesday accused Princess Diana &apos;s eldest son Prince William of having his hands &quot; awash with blood &quot; after a newspaper reported he had stalked and shot his first stag . 
the Daily Telegraph said the 14-year-old prince made the kill last month on Queen Elizabeth &apos;s Balmoral estate in the Scottish Highlands . 
he was accompanied by his 12-year-old brother Harry and his father Prince Charles . 
les Ward , director of the Edinburgh-based animal rights group Advocates For Animals , condemned both Charles and the young prince . 
&quot; It is absolutely disgusting that any father should take his young son to shoot and kill an animal , &quot; he said . 
&quot; His hands ( William &apos;s ) are awash with blood . 
it goes against public opinion and shows a total disrespect for animal life . 
the League Against Cruel Sports said culling of deer should be done by professionals , not treated as a &quot; sporting accessory &quot; by the royal family . 
&quot; They seem to be bringing up the prince with brutal , dreadful morals , &quot; said spokesman Kevin Saunders . 
the Daily Telegraph said that after the kill , the stag would have been &quot; gralloched &quot; -- disembowelled with a large knife -- in order to prevent the carcass from bloating and to make it easier to be dragged away . 
Prince Charles is a keen hunter , as is Tiggy Legge-Bourke , the aide who is responsible for looking after his sons when they are with him . 
Princess Diana , who was divorced from Charles in August , has no taste for blood sports . 
Legge-Bourke has helped the young princes practise their marksmanship by shooting rabbits and crows .
