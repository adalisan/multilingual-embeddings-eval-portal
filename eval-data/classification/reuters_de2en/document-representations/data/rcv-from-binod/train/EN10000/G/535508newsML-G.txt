Hong Kong &apos;s civil service chief on Thursday refused to surrender a confidential report on the removal of the territory &apos;s immigration chief last year , sparking a threat of legal action against the government . 
appearing before a select committee of Hong Kong &apos;s Legislative Council , Anson Chan refused a request by the panel to hand over the report compiled by the territory &apos;s anti-graft agency on former immigration director Laurence Leung . 
Chan , who has repeatedly said the government would not release the report , said doing so could harm the &quot; public interest &quot; and compromise the work of the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC ) . 
the frustrated committee , which is looking into Leung &apos;s mysterious forced retirement , decided to hire a British lawyer familiar with arguments over &quot; public interest &quot; immunity to determine whether the government was breaking the law in withholding the report . 
&quot; We want to hire a Queen &apos;s counsel ( barrister ) to follow this case . 
the Hong Kong government has refused to disclose the report . 
but is that right ? 
&quot; IP Kwok-him , chairman of the committee , told reporters . 
Leung was forced out of his post last July after ICAC investigators found he had failed to disclose some business activities , but the government refused to specify the reasons for his removal . 
that sparked speculation that Leung was a Chinese spy who could give Beijing highly sensitive information on Chinese dissidents seeking shelter in Hong Kong or senior government officials who hold foreign passports . 
both the government and Leung have denied the spying rumours . 
Hong Kong returns to Chinese control on July after more than 150 years as a British colony .
