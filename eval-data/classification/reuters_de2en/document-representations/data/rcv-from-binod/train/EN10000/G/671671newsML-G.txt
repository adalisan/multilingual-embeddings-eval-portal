the European Union Wednesday cobbled together a new treaty , offering little to its increasingly disenchanted citizens and even less to those countries lining up to join the 15-member western club . 
ending marathon talks in the early hours of Wednesday , the Dutch EU presidency admitted that the new text updating the Maastricht Treaty , also brokered by the Netherlands five years ago , was modest fare . 
&quot; In some areas we did not achieve as much as we proposed , but we should be able to round off EMU ( economic and monetary union ) and move to enlargement , &quot; Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok told a news conference . 
&quot; All in all , the substance of the treaty is very good . 
the treaty , thrashed out over two days of intensive talks , following 15 months of preparatory negotiation , includes an employment chapter and deeper cooperation on asylum , immigration and crime-busting , but puts off changes to the balance of power in the 15-nation bloc until new members join early in the next century . 
the leaders also failed to resolve a split over whether to integrate the Western European Union into the bloc . 
&quot; The treaty made progress , but not as much as we had hoped , &quot; Italian Premier Romano Prodi told reporters after the summit . 
&quot; concrete steps forward have been made , but at a slower pace than we would have wanted , &quot; he said . 
a final agreement was held up for over an hour by Spain &apos;s refusal to agree to a plan under which it would have had fewer votes in the joint decision-making process than the bloc &apos;s four major powers -- Germany , France , Britain and Italy . 
streamlining the decision-making procedures was seen as crucial to preparing the bloc for a dozen new members , primarily from the former Soviet bloc , over the next decade . 
leaders were keen to put some gloss on the text , saying it was designed to further help the bloc &apos;s expansion . 
&quot; The principle of enlargement has been very , very strongly written into everything we have done . 
this has made it quite clear that enlargement is the major objective of the EU and will proceed , &quot; British Prime Minister Tony Blair told reporters . 
the largely fudged deal added to the EU &apos;s woes at a summit overshadowed from the start by a Franco-German dispute over economic control after the introduction of a single currency . 
although the currency fight was smoothed over on Monday with a compromise linking French demands for job creation to German insistence on budgetary discipline , it was widely seen as just papering over a political gulf that would probably re-open . 
the long treaty negotiations leading up to the meeting had already toned down much of what the bloc had hoped to achieve in terms of signalling a new Citizens &apos; Europe for the next century . 
the summit continued that process . 
Britain , worried about undermining NATO &apos;s role , effectively vetoed a Franco-German idea of building a European defence architecture alongside the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation by merging the Western European Union into the bloc . 
the treaty simply recognised a &quot; possibility &quot; that it would happen one day . 
grand designs to appoint a senior figure to give a single face and voice to a credible common European foreign policy also came to little , with a little-known Eurocrat expected to take the job of representing the Union around the globe . 
even the elements of the package that were agreed upon had their setbacks , with Germany refusing to surrender its veto on asylum policy and Britain , Ireland and Denmark winning opt-outs from various moves to beef up cooperation on borders and immigration . 
the plan was designed to create an area of freedom , security and justice , appealing to citizens who are turning away from the bloc because of austerity programmes needed to get monetary union off its planned January 1999 launch-pad .
