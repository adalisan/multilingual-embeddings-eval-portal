Argentine bonds finished flat to slightly higher Wednesday after a strong opening ended in small changes in prices from Tuesday &apos;s close . 
&quot; It was a different day with more of the same , &quot; said a trader at a large Argentine bank , referring to the market &apos;s inability to make headway until the government &apos;s tax-hiking measures to plug the budget deficit are finally passed . 
the market was unchanged on Tuesday as well . 
after weeks of waiting , Congress began discussing the measures Wednesday . 
that is still no guarantee that the whole plan will be passed , but at least the wheels are in motion , traders said . 
the 5.5 percent dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 rose $ 0.07 to 117.42 , after rising as high as 118.0 in the morning . 
traders said the local market was boosted in the morning by short-covering in New York for Argentine FRBs . 
that buying resulted from demand for Latin American paper emanating from rising hopes Brazil &apos;s Senate will pass Thursday a bill authorizing the Central Bank to buy back Brady bonds and swap them for other sovereign debt , said an analyst . 
but in the afternoon , the market was pulled back down by some profit-taking by local funds , said traders . 
market players reported that Thursday &apos;s session will depend on the outcome of the congressional debate on the government measures . 
the debate is expected to last through the night . 
in the money markets , one-day call money rates fell to 7.15 percent from 7.30 percent .
