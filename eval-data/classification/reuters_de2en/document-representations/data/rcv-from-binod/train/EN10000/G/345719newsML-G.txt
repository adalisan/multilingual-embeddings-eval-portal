pressure increased on the Belgian government on Thursday as a liberal opposition party offered to trade places in the cabinet with the scandal-torn francophone socialists and a former army colonel was charged with corruption . 
&quot; With the PRL in the government things would change quickly , &quot; Louis Michel , chairman of the francophone liberal party PRL told Belgian radio . 
but the Dutch-speaking Christian-Democratic CVP , the largest partner in the four-party coalition , was cool to the idea of changing the government . 
we are not at the stage of changing coalition partners , &quot; CVP chairman Marc Van Peel said in a radio interview . 
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene &apos;s government of Christian-Democrats and Socialists from both sides of the French-Dutch language divide has been rocked by a series of bribery scandals , notably involving the francophone Socialist Party ( PS ) . 
earlier this week , Van Peel said his party &apos;s confidence in the PS had been &quot; severely shocked &quot; . 
the latest scandal centres on allegations that French aerospace group group Dassault paid millions of Belgian francs in kickbacks to politicians to win an air force order in 1989 . 
last week , two former PS officials were arrested and charged with corruption . 
their lawyers have said they received 30 million francs ( about $ 1 million ) from Dassault on behalf of the PS but Dassault has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing . 
a court official said on Thursday that a former Belgian army colonel had also been charged with corruption in the Dassault probe . 
he was not arrested . 
&quot; Ex-colonel Willy Dewint has been charged with corruption . 
he has not been arrested , &quot; the official told Reuters . 
Belgian media said Dewint headed a company which lobbied for Dassault , but the official declined to confirm or deny this . 
the Dassault investigation has led to numerous calls , both from the opposition and from government party politicians , for the PS to distance itself from those responsible for party finances in the late eighties . 
but then PS chairman Guy Spitaels has refused to step down from his current post as president of the Walloon regional parliament . 
in Belgium , governments are usually made up of the same political families from Dutch-speaking Flanders in the North and French-speaking Wallonia in the South and the CVP has been part of every coalition since shortly after World War Two . 
a coalition government with a socialist partner from one side of the country and a liberal partner from the other has never been tried before .
