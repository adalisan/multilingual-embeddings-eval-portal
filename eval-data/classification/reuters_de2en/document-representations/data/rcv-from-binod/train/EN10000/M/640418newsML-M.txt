German shares ended electronic trade higher on Thursday , but off earlier highs when the IBIS DAX index of electronic trade briefly threatened to breach the psychologically-important 3,700-point level . 
the index at one point went as high as 3,690.85 points , and looked set to hit 3,700 , but lacked the necessary impetus to deliver the gains and fell back . 
&quot; It is the futures market driving us higher today , &quot; said one trader , who said the market was jittery in the absence of any new data to help deliver new gains . 
earlier the DAX index , which tracks bourse trade in 30 German blue-chips , ended up 11.19 points , or 0.31 percent , at 3,673.03 points . 
the big corporate news of the afternoon was the fall in in the share price of graphite and carbon maker SGL Carbon .

SGL Carbon ended bourse trade in Frankfurt earlier on down 30 pfennigs at 260.20 marks , while the DAX index of bourse trade ended up 0.31 percent at 3,673.03 points . 
shares in SGL Carbon were suspended from trade on Wall Street in post-bourse trade pending an announcement . 
otherwise , interest was focused on individual stocks , with Deutsche Bank AG remaining in vogue to end up 90 pfennigs to 99.90 marks . 
dealers said there was no particular reason for Deutsche &apos;s popularity , but that the bank was catching up after lagging others in the financial sector . 
Steelmaker Thyssen AG ended up 3.60 marks at 409.60 , despite a downgrade by Salomon Brothers . 
other analysts had been raising their estimates on the stock , dealers said . 
airline Deutsche Lufthansa also ended sharply higher , up 1.15 marks or nearly four percent at 30.75 marks .
