Germany acknowledged on Thursday that a shipment of 380 tonnes of hazardous waste stuck in transit in Hungary had been exported illegally , and said it would take the consignment back . 
the containers were due to be shipped to China via Croatia , but Croatian authorities refused to let them cross the border . 
press reports said the shipment included six tonnes of wood preservative from the north German state of Lower Saxony and 34 tonnes of a substance used to treat the outer shell of army tanks . 
&quot; The federal government and the regional states ask Lower Saxony to coordinate the necessary return of the waste exported illegally to Hungary , &quot; said a statement issued after a meeting of officials from Bonn and Germany &apos;s federal states in Ratzeburg , northern Germany . 
the statement said the return of the waste would initially be financed by a &quot; solidarity fund &quot; created to cope with previous illegal waste exports . 
it called for a meeting next week of the federal states , who have been quarrelling over who should pay for the return transport , and the companies involved in the shipment .
