European Union diplomats said on Tuesday the Serbian government was ready to act on the recommendations of an OSCE report calling on President Slobodan Milosevic to recognise local election results . 
Dutch First Secretary Menno Lenstra who led an EU delegation in a meeting with the Yugoslav deputy foreign minister said he understood the Serbian government was looking for ways to implement the report by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) 
&quot; It was a very positive meeting , &quot; Lenstra told Reuters . 
&quot; We conveyed our concern but on the other hand we also found on the other side the preparedness to act on the recommendations of the OSCE special representative &apos;s report . 
the OSCE &apos;s chief recomendation was full acceptance of November local elections in which the opposition says it was cheated of victory in 15 of Serbia &apos;s biggest towns including the capital Belgrade . 
the EU delegation met Nikola Cicanovic , deputy foreign minister of Serbian-led Yugoslavia , after failing to win an audience either with Milosevic or Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic . 
&quot; They are welcoming the report -- they have said that several times already -- and they gave us the impression they are working on it , &quot; Lenstra said . 
diplomats in the EU group included Lenstra , the British charge d &apos;affaires Tony Crombie , Italian Ambassador Francesco Bascone , and Sven Kristiansen , the EU charge . 
the delegation was representing the EU in a move aimed at stepping up international pressure on Milosevic to accept the findings of the OSCE report . 
the dispute has sparked 44 days of mass demonstrations in Belgrade and dozens of other towns from students and opposition supporters demanding respect for democracy . 
the street protests which attracted up to a quarter of a million people at their height , remained peaceful until the ruling Socialist party brought thousands of supporters to a counter-rally in Belgrade on December 24 . 
the ensuing clashes between rival supporters left one man dead and at least 50 injured including one man with a gun-shot wound to the head still reported to be in a critical condition . 
the opposition Zajedno ( Together ) coalition planned to usher in the New Year with a huge street party with alarm clocks and a cacophony of bells it says will be tolling for Milosevic . 
according to coalition plans , on the stroke of midnight the clocks will all start ringing in a light-hearted notification to the socialist president that his time is running out . 
the party was to include a costume ball for children followed by a procession in mid-evening and then a huge party in Republic Square with pop music groups and actors . 
the street spectacle took advantage of Belgrade &apos;s traditional enthusiasm for celebrating the New Year to help maintain the enthusiasm of Zajedno &apos;s supporters whose ranks have dwindled since snowy , sub-zero weather set in a week ago . 
it is also a way round an Interior Ministry ban on marches that disrupt traffic that has driven the protests off the city streets and onto a narrow pedestrian mall . 
in a further bid to avoid violence , the independent news agency beta reported that Zajedno had called on its supporters not to bring firearms into the city and refrain from the custom of shooting in the air . 
&quot; We urge all Belgraders to come to Republic Square armed only with joy and the spirit that they have demonstratd over the past 42 days of protests , &quot; Zajedno spokesman Slobodan Vuksanovic told beta .
