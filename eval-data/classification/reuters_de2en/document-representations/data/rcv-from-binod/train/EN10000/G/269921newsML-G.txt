pressured to make his Cabinet more ethnically diverse , President Bill Clinton on Friday brought back a departing official to serve as energy secretary and tapped a top White House aide as his Labor secretary . 
transportation Secretary Federico Pena , a Hispanic who had announced his resignation and put his house up for sale , was nominated to take over the Energy Department from Hazel O &apos;Leary , as Clinton completed his Cabinet choices for his second term . 
Alexis Herman , director of White House public liaison , an office that among other duties reaches out to minorities , was nominated as Labor secretary to replace Robert Reich , to end a fierce battle with two other candidates for the position . 
black organizations led by civil rights leader Jesse Jackson had mounted a major campaign on her behalf . 
Clinton insisted he was not making the selections based on filling an ethnic quota but said he wanted to make sure all Americans are represented . 
&quot; I am very proud of this Cabinet , I am proud that they are diverse but I would not have appointed a single one of them because of their gender or their racial or ethnic background , had I not thought that they would succeed , &quot; he said . 
in a nominating ceremony punctuated by cries from the small children of some of the nominees , the president also picked the eldest son of former New York Gov. 
Mario Cuomo , Andrew Cuomo , to take over as secretary of Housing and Urban Development from Henry Cisneros . 
Clinton selected Federal Highway Administrator Rodney Slater , a longtime Clinton colleague from Arkansas , as his nominee to replace Pena as transportation secretary . 
and he nominated Janet Yellen , a member of the Federal Reserve Board , as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers , a non-Cabinet board that provides economic analysis . 
Pena , a former mayor of Denver , was the beneficary of a last-minute conversion by Clinton , who had been leaning toward another candidate as energy secretary . 
&quot; I think one of the first things I &apos;ll do is take down the for-sale sign in front of my house , &quot; Pena told the event . 
as transportation secretary , Pena had come under fire for a statement made in May after the crash of a Valujet airliner near Miami that Valujet was a safe airline . 
U.S. authorities later grounded Valujet for safety shortcomings , although it has since resumed flying . 
but administration officials defended Pena , saying he had worked hard to promote airline safety . 
&quot; If you look at what he &apos;s doing , he &apos;s promoted safety in a way no other secretary has , &quot; said one defender . 
however , Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici of New Mexico said Pena could face some trouble in the Senate confirmation process &quot; because he has little or no apparent experience in the major Energy Department missions . 
a key factor was to put a Hispanic on the Cabinet after Hispanics turned out in large numbers in support of Clinton &apos;s re-election . 
Clinton &apos;s first term had included two , but for his second term he had only chosen Rep. Bill Richardson , of New Mexico , as ambassador to the United Nations , a seat that has Cabinet status under Clinton but not traditionally . 
&quot; Let &apos;s put it this way , &quot; said one White House official . 
&quot; If there had not been another appointment for Hispanics , it would have been noticed . 
the fact is Hispanics came out in very high numbers for the president in the election . 
Clinton named another Hispanic , Aida Alvarez , as his choice to head the Small Business Administration . 
she has been in charge of federal housing oversight at HUD . 
she made a brief statement in Spanish at the event . 
in what officials called the most contentious Cabinet competition , Herman won out over Rep. Esteban Torres , a California Democrat . 
Hispanic groups had rallied for Torres . 
Union groups had fought for former Democratic Sen. Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania . 
Clinton took the step of publicly thanking Torres and Wofford for being considered . 
Clinton picked his boyhood friend and former White House chief of staff , Thomas &quot; Mack &quot; McLarty to serve as a special envoy to Latin America , working out of the White House . 
he chose a top aide , Bruce Reed , to take over from Carol Rasco as domestic policy adviser and directed her to lead a literacy campaign . 
Clinton also reappointed a number of Cabinet officials for his second term , including Education Secretary Richard Riley , Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman , Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown .
