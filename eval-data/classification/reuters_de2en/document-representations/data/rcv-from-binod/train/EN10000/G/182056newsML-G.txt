South African President Nelson Mandela met Zambian President Frederick Chiluba on Tuesday to discuss a compromise aimed at resolving Zambia &apos;s electoral impasse . 
Mandela told a news conference after their hour-long meeting that Chiluba had put forth a &quot; very important &quot; proposal which could end an opposition party boycott of general elections scheduled for November 18 . 
&quot; I am satisfied with our discussions and I am satisfied that we have made good progress which can bring about a solution in Zambia in regard to these elections , &quot; Mandela told reporters . 
Chiluba , standing beside Mandela on the steps of the South African leader &apos;s residence , said : &quot; I believe we will resolve this problem one way or the other ... I came to consult and I believe that the discussions have been very well conducted . 
seven opposition parties , including former president Kenneth Kaunda &apos;s United National Independence Party , are boycotting the polls which they say have been arranged to ensure that Chiluba &apos;s Movement for multi-party Democracy ( MMD ) remains in power . 
the parties are opposed to a new constitution which bars some candidates , including Kaunda , from standing for president if they are first-generation Zambians . 
Mandela declined to outline Chiluba &apos;s offer , saying : &quot; What we are interested in is a settlement . 
( Chiluba ) is a man with a great deal of responsibility and any suggestion he makes to me , he must canvass with his colleagues back in Zambia . 
asked if Monday &apos;s polls would go ahead on schedule , Chiluba left the door open for a possible postponement , saying : &quot; For now I would say &apos; yes &apos; , but let &apos;s see if we can consult . 
Lusaka &apos;s Suprme Court is expected to rule on on Wednesday on a petition by opposition parties challenging Chiluba &apos;s eligibility to contest the polls by alleging he lied about his parentage and nationality in filing nomination papers .
