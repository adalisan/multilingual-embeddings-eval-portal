IPE Brent crude futures face tough resistance around the boundaries of a downward gap left between the sessions of April 2 and 3 , technical analysts said on Monday . 
may Brent , which is due to expire on Tuesday , closed , five cents off at $ 17.88 a barrel , while the June contract ended seven cents lower at $ 18.07 . 
looking at the June contract , Sucden &apos;s Darren Gurner saw few signs that Brent would be pushing much higher in the near future . 
he noted key resistance around the downward gap spanning the $ 18.62 high of April 3 and the $ 18.77 low of April 2 . 
&quot; It hasn &apos;t even made an attempt to fill the gap over the past few sessions , &quot; he said . 
in the unexpected event that Brent did breach the $ 18.77 mark , Gurner pegged resistance at $ 19.17 in line with where the 40-day moving average hits the daily June chart . 
on the downside , he pegged support initially at the psychological $ 18 level and at $ 17.80 the low of April 10 . 
below there , he saw further supports around $ 17.74 , $ 17.47 and $ 17.10 in line with lows of last August 29 , 27 and 6 respectively . 
&quot; I &apos;m not saying we &apos;re going to get down to $ 17 in the next week , but I think it &apos;s more likely we &apos;ll see $ 17 before we see $ 20 again , &quot; said Gurner . 
Peter Sceats of CharTech-MCS painted a similarly bearish picture in his weekly report . 
the one bright spot on the charts , as far as Brent was concerned , was a double bottom on the NYMEX crude charts seen at $ 18.96 on April 10 and 4 . 
&quot; It would be remiss of us to ignore the potential effect that the bull bottom on spot NYMEX futures may have on Brent ... Looking on the optimistic side if the double bottom on TI does kick in , it is likely that the following closure of the Brent gap will flag a further modest move up , &quot; Sceats said . 
on the upside , Sceats also saw resistance at the down trendline off the $ 24.91 high of January . 
gas oil was similarly lacklustre even though the May contract closed $ 3 higher at $ 163.50 a tonne on Friday . 
Gurner saw gas oil meandering lower in line with a downward trend channel with its higher level drawn off the $ 177.50 high of March 19 and the lower level off the low of $ 171.50 of March 17 . 
in line with the channel , Gurner pegged key resistance around $ 165 to $ 165.50 . 
&quot; It &apos;s unlikely it will breach the $ 165 level , I think it &apos;s more likely we &apos;ll see it meandering lower in line with the trend channel , &quot; he said .
