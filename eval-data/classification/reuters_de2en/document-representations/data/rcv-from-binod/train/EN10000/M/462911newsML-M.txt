CSCE coffee finished moderately weaker on Monday as speculators continued to unload long positions , but industry-linked buying helped moderate the bearish tone , dealers said . 
may futures fell 2.85 cents per lb on the day , to 162.90 , having ranged from 158.65 to 162.90 . 
Second-position July eased 1.75 , to 153.80 , narrowing the nearby switch to 9.10 . 
the arabica market took a pounding early in the day , sagging seven cents at one point amid heavy selling by commodity funds and day traders . 
traders said a sharp downward break at the open activated a succession of sell stops through the 160-cent area . 
overhead selling by Colombia accelerated the decline . 
but roasters , lured by the lowest prices the market has seen in a month , helped chip away at the losses . 
&quot; There was a nice little rally toward the end of the day , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; But the roasters are scale buyers , they &apos;re not paying up . 
while the supply crunch that sent the market to two-and-a-half year highs in February appeared far from over , analysts said a steady recovery of consumer stocks in recent weeks had taken the steam out of the rally . 
&quot; The market is relieved by the influx of supply coming from Central American countries , so it &apos;s not hyper-worried , &quot; said Refco Inc analyst Ann Prendergast . 
&quot; They &apos;re not exactly breathing easy , but they &apos;re relieved . 
Prendergast said the market would likely drift in a range between 160-177 cents in the near-term , though a break below 154 -- a double chart bottom from mid-February -- would send a sharply bearish signal . 
&quot; The tightness in supply is real , so coffee is still going to find a range higher than it had been trading ( before January ) , &quot; she added . 
in other news , Colombia &apos;s truckers voted over the weekend to go out on strike on April 20 , but the country &apos;s transport minister warned on Monday he would seek to outlaw the planned work stoppage . 
the day &apos;s volume was heavy , at an estimated 16,605 lots .
