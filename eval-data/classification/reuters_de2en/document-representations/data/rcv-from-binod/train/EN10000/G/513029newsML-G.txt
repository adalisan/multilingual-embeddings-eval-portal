Colombia conceded it has serious human rights problems on Wednesday after the United Nations Human Rights Commission blamed state agents and guerrilla groups alike for growing political bloodshed . 
&quot; The government shares the commission &apos;s concern about the endemic violence and internal armed conflict that affects many regions of the country and has serious consequences in terms of human rights , &quot; the foreign ministry said . 
it said the statement by the chairman of the Geneva-based U.N. watchdog group &quot; reflects a very constructive spirit of cooperation . 
&quot; But it made no reference to the commission &apos;s criticism of the role of &quot; state agents &quot; in rampant cases of rights abuses , tacitly acknowledging that Colombia &apos;s powerful military and police are part of the problem . 
the 53-member U.N. body said it was deeply concerned by &quot; thousands of violations &quot; of the right to life in Colombia . 
&quot; This conflict entails serious and continuous violations of human rights and humanitarian law both by state agents and guerrilla groups , &quot; it said . 
the statement said the commission was deeply preoccupied by disappearances in Colombia , voiced concern about the increasing involvement of right-wing paramilitary groups and urged leftist guerrillas to stop kidnappings and indiscriminate killings . 
tens of thousands of Colombians have died in the guerrilla war , which dates back more than three decades and shows no sign of ending soon . 
the country &apos;s leading guerrilla group , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) , was founded as a Marxist , pro-Soviet group in 1964 . 
leaders of the group rebuffed a call from President Ernesto Samper last week for unconditional peace talks , saying they had no interest in negotiating with &quot; an illegitimate government . 
Samper , WHP steps down in August 1998 , has been weakened since the early days of his administration by charges he used drug money to finance his 1994 election campaign .
