the dollar tumbled to the lowest level against the yen in five months on Tuesday as speculation that Japan would raise interest rates sparked large selling of the greenback . 
higher Japanese rates would make yen-based assets more attractive , drawing away funds from U.S. investments . 
the dollar had fallen in European trading to 111.98 yen , its lowest level since December 1996 on reports that Japan &apos;s ruling Liberal Democratic Party was considering making a recommendation to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto that Japan raise its official discount rate . 
the Bank of Japan has kept its official discount rate at a record low 0.5 percent since September 1995 . 
&quot; As long as that fear is out there , that &apos;s going to keep being traded off even though it may never come to fruition any time soon , &quot; said David Ethridge , director of currency analysis in North America at mms International . 
&quot; fears move markets . 
the dollar bounced from the lows and stood above 113 yen after Japanese officials warned that the yen &apos;s rise had been too rapid and a rate hike was not likely in the short-term . 
the dollar remains anaemic , however , after having lost near 11 percent from 4-1 / 2 year peaks of 127.46 yen on May 1 . 
the dollar also fell sharply to 1.6945 German marks from 1.7080 marks . 
reverberations from news of a huge rise in Japan &apos;s trade surplus also continued to ripple through currency markets . 
Japan &apos;s trade surplus more than doubled in April from a year earlier to 831.48 billion yen . 
Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a news conference on Tuesday that the rise in the surplus was temporary and unlikely to become a major issue with other countries . 
still , Takanobu Igarashi , a senior economist at Sanwa Bank Ltd in New York , emphasised that the important point is that Mitsuzuka admitted Japan &apos;s surplus was increasing . 
&quot; So , that &apos;s why the market reacted by selling the dollar against yen , &quot; Igarashi said . 
dealers also noted rumours that funds of billionaire financier George Soros were selling dollars for yen . 
analysts said the dollar may not regain its recent highs even if the U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates at its policy-making meeting on Tuesday . 
the Fed raised the federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans -- by 25 basis points to 5.50 percent after its last meeting in March . 
&quot; The trend is very strongly pro-yen at the moment . 
and I suspect the dollar will come under pressure even if the Fed raises interest rates this evening , &quot; said Keith Edmonds , chief analyst at IBJ International in London . 
&quot; For a long time , dollar / yen has been out of control . 
we had an unbalanced market , we had huge skew in positioning . 
everyone was short of yen . 
it was the trade of last year : borrow yen -- sell it . 
that was an unsustainable situation and it is being reversed , &quot; said Paul Meggyesi , senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London . 
in other trading , the dollar fell to 1.4060 Swiss francs from 1.4265 and edged up to Canadian $ 1.3723 from C $ 1.3713 . 
sterling rose to $ 1.6465 from $ 1.6400 .
