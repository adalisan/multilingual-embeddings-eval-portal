successful Davis Cup coach Yannick Noah carried his winning formula into women &apos;s tennis on Sunday , guiding France to their first Fed Cup final at the expense of Belgium . 
with their semifinal tie level at 2-2 , Nathalie Tauziat and Alexandra Fusai clinched the victory with a 3-6 6-2 7-5 doubles victory over Els Callens and Laurence Courtois . 
France had taken part in seven Fed Cup semifinals but had never made it to the final . 
Noah led France &apos;s men &apos;s team to Davis Cup titles in 1991 and last year . 
the two Davis Cup victories prompted French women players to ask Noah to captain them . 
I &apos;ve already lived the same emotion with the boys and it &apos;s unforgettable , &quot; Noah said . 
&quot; It &apos;ll be fantastic with the girls too . 
it &apos;s to experience moments like this that I &apos;ve accepted to captain them . 
but I didn &apos;t expect us to go this far in my first season with them . 
France &apos;s victory was all the more spectacular as they were without injured Mary Pierce , who pulled out because of a sore right arm . 
Noah also took risks ahead of the tie played at the French Riviera resort of Nice , picking Fusai rather than veteran Tauziat to play the singles . 
but the gamble paid off against the Belgians , who beat favourites Spain in the previous round , as Fusai is more of a claycourt specialist than Tauziat . 
Fusai beat Belgian number one Sabine Appelmans , but lost to Dominique van roost in the singles . 
Sandrine Testud also beat Appelmans and fell to van roost . 
France will meet either the Czech Republic or the Netherlands in the final .
