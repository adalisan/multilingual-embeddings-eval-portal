the UK equity options market was thinly traded on Wednesday with traders unimpressed with the performance of underlying stocks and deciding not to get too deeply involved , dealers said . 
the bulk of deals by early afternoon were related to near month expiry -- April stock options expire today and FTSE index options for April on Friday . 
differing views on market volatility were behind the main trade in European style FTSE options . 
it concerned one trader buying 1,000 December 4325 puts at 183-1 / 2p which were hedged by buying June FTSE futures at 4320 . 
an increase in market volatility will make this trade profitable . 
the seller of the options hedged his position by selling FTSE futures so that decreasing volatility -- which will reduce option premiums -- will enable him to make a profit . 
over in stock options , Barclays Bank caught the attention of one trader who sold a put spread . 
the deal involved buying 400 July 950 puts at 14p and selling 400 July 1050 puts at 50p making a net credit of 36p . 
at expiry , if the underlying shares are above 1050p , both options will be worthless and the trader will have made a maximum profit of 36p . 
if the shares go below 950p , the maximum loss will be 64p . 
Breakeven is at 1014p . 
Barclays shares fell 9-1 / 2p to 1016p . 
and in conglomerate BTR the main deal was from a seller of 500 August 240 puts at about 6p . 
the shares added 1 / 2p to 254p .
