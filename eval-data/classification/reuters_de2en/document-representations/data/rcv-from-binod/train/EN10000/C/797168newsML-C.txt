Safmarine , the South African shipping group , said on Tuesday it made a failed bid to buy Contship Containerlines , the shipping firm to be acquired by Canadian Pacific Ltd . 
Howard Boyd , chief executive of Safmarine-CMBT Lines , told Reuters : &quot; Yes , we did make a bid for Contship , but the rival offer from Canadian Pacific is the one which has won . 
but he said he believed the failure to clinch the acquisition would not sour relations with either Canadian Pacific or Contship , both of which are currently its partners in shipping trades . 
Canadian Pacific earlier announced that its CP Ships subsidiary had reached agreement in principle to acquire Contship Containerlines for an undisclosed sum . 
Safmarine-CMBT Lines is 75 percent controlled by Safmarine , part of Safmarine and Rennies Holdings Ltd . 
Boyd said : &quot; We already collaborate with Contship on their Indian Ocean service , and with CP Ships at our Antwerp terminal . 
&quot; We hope that these relations can be developed in the interests of both companies , &quot; he added . 
Boyd said , &quot; Safmarine-CMBT Lines remains eager to expand . 
we have stated previously that we intend to increase our position on the North-South liner trades - that growth is likely to come both internally and externally .
