Polish shares extended Thursday &apos;s slight fall and analyst said the market would likely stabilise next week after this week &apos;s 3.8-percent rebound to 16,263.8 points that followed last week &apos;s 6.1-percent drop . 
&quot; The market should stabilise next week because the WIG fell a lot from the beginning of March and no more deep falls can be expected , and the market could stay between 16,000 and 16,500 , &quot; said Artur Kobos , a trader at ING Baring Securities in Warsaw . 
some analysts said shares could receive a boost next week if March &apos;s monthly inflation figure due on Tuesday comes in below one percent . 
but they said this year &apos;s heavy primary market offer , beginning next week with paper firm Celuloza Swiecie &apos;s public offering of at least 112.5 million zlotys , could draw capital from listed stocks . 
analysts also said Warsaw shares could suffer if significant falls resulted on Western bourses from Friday &apos;s U.S. PPI and retail sales data . 
the main market &apos;s all-share WIG index fell 0.4 percent to 16,263.8 points and turnover fell 19.7 percent to 149.6 million zlotys on all three markets . 
analysts said Mostostal Gdansk , Mostostal Export and Mostostal Zabrze , which rose 5.6 , 3.6 and 2.4 percent respectively in active trade , reflected the positive outlook for Poland &apos;s construction industry . 
trade in Espebepe , which fell 2.2 percent , will be suspended on Monday as the firm &apos;s creditors meet to discuss a possible write-off of its 75 million zlotys in debt . 
analysts said Kable fell 4.3 percent in profit-taking on the back of its recent surge after 50-percent owner NKT Kables called a public tender offer at 41 zlotys per share .
