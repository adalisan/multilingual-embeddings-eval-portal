Peronist President Carlos Menem poured scorn on Tuesday on the threat of a new alliance between Argentina &apos;s two biggest opposition parties , the Radicals and the centre-left Frepaso coalition . 
&quot; They are uniting against the boogeyman Menem because I &apos;ve never lost an election , &quot; said Menem , boasting of his unbeaten record in national and local political contests , and even his home province &apos;s soccer club . 
&quot; That bothers them . 
I have never bitten the dust of defeat and I &apos;m going to retire unbeaten , so they want to unite to defeat me . 
but they won &apos;t manage it , &quot; he told reporters . 
Menem , first elected president in 1989 , won a second consecutive term in a landslide victory May 1995 after getting Congress to change the constitution to let him run again . 
now 67 , he is blocked from seeking a third consecutive term in 1999 , though some loyalists want the law changed again . 
the Radicals , Peronism &apos;s traditional rivals , and the Frepaso , which includes many disaffected Peronists , are moving closer to an alliance for next year &apos;s mid-term elections . 
that vote is a key challenge for Menem , whose popularity has sunk to all-time lows following a deep recession , unemployment of 17.1 percent , savage cutbacks and tax hikes . 
radical elder statesman and ex-President Raul Alfonsin met Frepaso leader Carlos &quot; Chacho &quot; Alvarez on Monday . 
according to Alfonsin , they agreed to &quot; chart common strategies to face greater challenges in the near future . 
Alvarez , who has found more open support for an alliance in the Radicals &apos; new party leader Rodolfo Terragno , said he believed that &quot; from now on the Radicals will be more open to the idea of forming an alliance . 
the two parties staged a &quot; blackout &quot; protest against Menem &apos;s austerity measures last month and have both backed two general strikes by trade unions in August and September . 
but some Radicals , including party second-in-command Melchor posse , complain the country &apos;s main opposition has just been following the Frepaso &apos;s lead in recent protests . 
the Radicals , who ruled Argentina from the end of military rule in 1983 to the economic chaos of 1989 , were humiliated into third place behind the Frepaso in 1995 &apos;s election . 
but they bounced back to trounce all comers in a historic first election for the mayor of Buenos Aires in June .
