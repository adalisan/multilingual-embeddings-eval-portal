a substantial inflow of funds into banks depressed call money rates to three percent by close of trade on Friday against the opening quotes of 3.75-4.25 percent , dealers said . 
they said repurchase of securities by the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) , auctioned last week , boosted liquidity with the banking system . 
&quot; Call money rates fell right after the opening quotes , &quot; said a dealer at a private bank . 
&quot; With the increased supply of funds , sentiment improved .

trade volumes in government securities improved sharply on easy call rates , they said . 
trades on the National Stock Exchange were worth 3.50 billion rupees on Friday against Thursday &apos;s 1.11 billion , dealers said . 
&quot; But there was no significant change in prices , &quot; said a dealer . 
&quot; Prices went up initially on buying interest but by afternoon , profit-taking by some banks led to a correction .
