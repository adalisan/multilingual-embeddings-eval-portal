developing countries are reaping the benefits of structural reform and powerful macroeconomic fundamentals to boost economic growth , according to the International Monetary Fund . 
in its World Economic Outlook , the IMF projected that the developing nations would post average 6.3 percent growth output in 1996 , up from 5.9 percent last year , as Mexico and Argentina recover , growth in Africa strengthens and the expansion in a number of Asian economies moderates . 
activity in the emerging markets was expected to remain buoyant on the the basis of strong domestic fundamentals and continued strong capital inflows , particularly of foreign direct investment , the IMF said . 
still , many countries struggle with macroeconomic imbalances and structural impediments that keep their living standards well below potential . 
the IMF called on emerging countries to reform their public sectors , remove price distortions , liberalize foreign trade and payments , open up foreign direct investment and strengthen the financial systems &apos; capacity to mobilize domestic savings and allocate financial resources . 
such reforms , essential elements of a comprehensive growth strategy , would need to be supported by prudent macroeconomic policies aimed at containing fiscal deficits , controlling inflation and maintaining external viability . 
to reduce the risks of banking crisis , &quot; the emerging markets need to enhance the soundness of their financial sectors through strong prudential standards and supervision &quot; the IMF said . 
while inflation is well under control in most emerging markets , the IMF said the combination of widening deficits on current account and rapid growth testified to excess demand pressures in Indonesia , Malaysia and Thailand . 
China would need to intensify its state enterprise reform , further liberalize trade , remove its few remaining restrictions on current account payments to strengthen the role of market forces in resource allocation , the IMF said . 
in India , the key to sustained performance would be ambitious fiscal consolidation that would relieve pressures on prices and the balance of payments , free resources for productive investment and provide a more conducive environment for needed structural reforms , the IMF said . 
Brazil would need fiscal consolidation and structural reforms , especially trade liberalization to safeguard progress on the inflation front and permit stronger sustained growth . 
sustained adjustment efforts in Mexico should help to further strengthen market confidence and permit growth to become firmly established , the IMF said .
