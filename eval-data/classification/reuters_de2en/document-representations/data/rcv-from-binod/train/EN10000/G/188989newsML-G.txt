more than 700 enraged Chinese college students destroyed a cinema after seeing a sex education film that was not as stimulating as they expected , the China Youth Daily said on Thursday . 
a 19-year old college student had distributed 2,000 leaflets to students in the central Chinese province of Anhui , billing the film as a sex movie with vivid wedding night footage , the newspaper said . 
the youthful entrepreneur raked in more than 3,000 yuan ( $ 361 ) from 700 students who were treated to no more than a sex-education documentary for newly-weds that the organiser had bought for 38 yuan , it said . 
frustrated students smashed 341 seats and tore the cinema screen of the theatre in the provincial capital of Hefei , causing an estimated 20,000 yuan in damage , the daily said . 
for a number of reasons , nobody had been arrested , it said but gave no details . 
sex was for decades a taboo subject under the puritan rule of China &apos;s communist leaders , but social change and a gradual loosening of campus controls have in recent years allowed many students to discreetly indulge in sexual activity .
