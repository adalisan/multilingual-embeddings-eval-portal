the main focus of Finnish bond , money and stock markets will be on U.S. markets next week -- a four-day one due to Epiphany Monday , analysts said on Friday . 
U.S. economic indicators including December producer prices , as well as employment data are expected to give important new clues for market direction . 
the Bundesbank is expected to keep key rates steady at its regular council meeting on Thursday . 
Finnish November trade , current account and money supply data and December consumer confidence figures are due next week . 
&quot; The market ( in the U.S. ) does not seem to know where to go , and investors are watching economic indicators and the bond market very closely , &quot; said Elina Timonen , chief analyst at Merita Securities . 
she added that investors &apos; main focus will be on U.S. December non-farm payrolls and unemployment , due on Friday at 1530 / 1330 GMT . 
if figures indicating strong economic growth are released , mounting inflation fears could fuel expectations of a rate hike and stocks would be hurt , analysts said . 
&quot; The psychological link ( between the Finnish and U.S. stock markets ) is very strong even though the fundamental link would not be that strong , &quot; an unnamed country strategist at a brokerage firm said . 
he said that it is impossible for Finnish share prices to rise or fall if at the same time stocks fall or rise in the U.S. 
the Finnish bonds and money markets are also expected to closely track U.S. markets . 
the focus will be on the December non-farm payrolls data . 
&quot; If the ( non-farm payrolls ) figure turns out to be + 250,000 or more the bond market is likely to get nervous , &quot; said Jukka Lepomaki , chief analyst at Merita Bank . 
in November , the rise in non-farm payrolls was 118,000 . 
the Bundesbank is expected to hold key interest rates unchanged at its regular council meeting on Thursday . 
currently the key discount rate is 2.50 percent and the Lombard rate 4.50 percent . 
Finnish economic indicators due next week are expected to be largely ignored by the markets unless they differ widely from forecasts . 
the Bank of Finland &apos;s preliminary trade balance and current account estimates for Novemebr will be released at 0900 / 0700 GMT on Tuesday . 
OKO &apos;s Rantatupa estimated the November trade balance at between three and four billion markka and he saw the current account surplus around two billion markka . 
in October M2 increased by + 0.3 percent year-on-year . 
consumer confidence rose to 13.8 points in November . 
analysts and market operators had mixed expectations about the outcome of the Finnish 2006 benchmark bond auction on Thursday . 
&quot; The long end ( of the yield curve ) can be interesting now ... as yields have risen lately , &quot; Rantatupa said . 
Lepomaki , on the other hand , expected investors to be quite unwilling to take large positions in the beginning of the year . 
but Lepomaki and an unnamed chief dealer saw good demand for T-bills in Tuesday &apos;s auction .
