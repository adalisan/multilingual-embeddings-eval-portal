two of Canada &apos;s largest privately held grain cooperatives said on Thursday they increased their stake in United grain Growers Ltd . 
Manitoba pool elevators and Alberta Wheat pool , through jointly owned 3339351 Canada Ltd , on Wednesday raised its holdings in UGG limited voting shares to 1,616,700 or 13 percent of outstanding UGG shares from 999,700 . 
&quot; This is an opportunity for the two pools to take a leading position in working with UGG to shape the future of the grain industry in Western Canada , &quot; a joint statement said . 
both farmer cooperatives said they would discuss plans for the future with their delegates within the month . 
the purchase follows more than a year of market speculation about whether a Canadian or U.S. grain handler was positioning itself to raise its stake in UGG . 
UGG held a 17 percent share of Canada &apos;s grain handling market in fiscal 1996 ( Aug / July ) .
