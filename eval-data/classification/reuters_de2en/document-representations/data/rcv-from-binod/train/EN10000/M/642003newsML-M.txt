German shares shrugged off a weak overnight performance on Wall Street to start out firm in bourse trade on Thursday , and were expected to remain broadly stable on a day seen low on dramatic German news . 
traders said the mood in the market was somewhat relieved by the apparent end to the dispute between the Bundesbank and the government over the revaluation of reserve assets . 
&quot; The important thing is that they seem to have found an amicable solution , &quot; said Josh Waiblinger , assistant vice president of equities at BHF-Bank . 
there was little reaction to first-quarter GDP data , which showed growth of 0.5 percent from the previous quarter and 1.4 percent year on year , slightly ahead of some expectations but not enough to pressure the market , dealers said . 
interest was focused on individual stocks , with Deutsche Bank AG remaining in vogue to trade up 80 pfennigs to 99.45 marks . 
dealers said there was no particular reason for Deutsche &apos;s popularity , but that the bank was catching up after lagging others in the financial sector . 
Steelmaker Thyssen AG was up 3.10 marks at 411.50 , despite a downgrade by Salomon Brothers . 
other analysts had been raising their estimates on the stock , dealers said . 
airline Deutsche Lufthansa was also sharply higher , up 1.30 marks or more than four percent at 30.80 marks . 
dealers said there was no single reason for its gains , but said sentiment regarding the share was generally good . 
one trader said this could mark a phase of interest in Lufthansa , as investors might be trying to push the airline &apos;s price higher before the government sells as stake in it later this year . 
&quot; Lufthansa strikes me as a clear buy , &quot; he said .
