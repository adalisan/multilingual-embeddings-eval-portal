early starter Tom Lehman shot an even-par round of 70 on Friday and watched as other top contenders crashed and burned at Congressional to give him the lead in the second round of the U.S. Open . 
Lehman benefitted from the nose-dive of first-round leader Colin Montgomerie , who sank with a 76 . 
others taking advantage included Tiger Woods and South African Ernie Els , who joined the chase in earnest . 
a two-hour , 18-minute suspension of play at midday due to the threat of lightning meant 45 players from the 156-man field were unable to complete the second round and will have to come back at 7 a.m. ( 1100 GMT ) on Saturday to finish . 
British Open champion Lehman bounced back from successive bogeys at the second and third holes to finish the day at three-under 137 for a one-shot edge over Els , Stewart Cink and Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe . 
McNulty had only completed 14 holes when play was halted for the day due to failing light . 
&quot; I got off to a very slow start , &quot; said Lehman , who three-putted the par-3 second hole and bogeyed the third after driving into the wretched rough that chokes Congressional &apos;s fairways . 
Lehman recovered with three birdies before the turn -- from less than a foot , two feet and seven feet . 
Els and Woods also thrived . 
Woods , the 21-year-old Masters champion , and 1994 Open champion Els both scorched the front side with four-under 31s on the way to matching 67s . 
Els stood at two-under-par 138 along with 24-year-old U.S. tour pro Cink , who also shot 67 . 
Woods was at one-over 141 , but very much in the hunt . 
&quot; The key is to keep getting better every day and you &apos;ll be there at the end , &quot; said Woods , who had struggled on the inward nine in the first round and carded 74 . 
&quot; The only thing I &apos;m concerned about is to get myself under par and into contention on Sunday . 
Montgomerie , who tamed the sprawling Congressional Country Club course with pinpoint driving and iron play on Thursday , lost his way Friday and sprayed shots all over the place on his way to a six-over round that left him four strokes back . 
Steve Stricker and hal Sutton , joint second at four-under after the first round , also flopped on the second day . 
Montgomerie , who had not teed off yet when play was halted , said the delay had affected him -- and the galleries . 
&quot; Waiting around for two hours , I can &apos;t use it as an excuse but it certainly didn &apos;t help my game , &quot; said the Briton , who appeared rattled at times by comments shouted from beyond the ropes . 
&quot; It was a very long day , very warm . 
the crowd was quite boisterous after the rain delay . 
obviously , they had been into certain tents , &quot; Mongomerie said , referring to hospitality tents where alcoholic beverages are served . 
&quot; That didn &apos;t help matters really . 
some light rain in the early morning and a brief heavy shower during the delay softened the course , but that did not help Stricker or Sutton on a hot , steamy day . 
Stricker soared to a 76 marked by three double bogeys , while Sutton slipped back to one-under through 15 holes . 
with 45 players still to finish the second round , the cut could not be established . 
other players moving up the ladder included Jeff Maggert , who shot 66 for a one-under total of 139 . 
also at one-under were David Ogrin , who had finished 17 holes , and Sutton . 
Els also had a complaint after the round . 
he said he was bothered by the slow pace of play , which was aggravated by the sudden departure of playing partner John Daly , who walked off the course after nine holes . 
I like to walk up to my ball , get the yardage and then hit it . 
but we couldn &apos;t do that most of the back nine , &quot; said Els . 
Els was left to play in a twosome with Payne Stewart after Daly departed . 
Daly , who has returned to competitive golf after a recent eight-week rehabilitation programme for treatment of alcoholism , later issued a statement saying he had withdrawn from the tournament because of mental and physical fatigue .
