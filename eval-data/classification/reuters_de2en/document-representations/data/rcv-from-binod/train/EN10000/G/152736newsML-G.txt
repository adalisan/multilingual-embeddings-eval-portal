Viorel Moldovan hit two first-half goals to fire grasshopper to a 3-1 win over Auxerre on Wednesday which put the Swiss on the brink of a quarter-final place in the European Cup . 
grasshopper &apos;s Champions &apos; League victory avenged a 1-0 loss to the French side two weeks ago and put the Zurich club top of group A. 
the Swiss league &apos;s leading scorer with 14 goals , Moldovan &apos;s two strikes were his first in the Champions &apos; League . 
he put grasshopper ahead in the 17th minute when he hammered home from point blank range past goalkeeper Lionel Charbonnier , who was left sprawling after making a diving save from Murat Yakin &apos;s header . 
grasshopper increased their lead when Kubilay Turkylimaz was brought down by Alain Goma and Moldovan scored from the spot in the 29th minute . 
Auxerre cut the deficit when grasshopper &apos;s mats Gren scored an own goal just two minutes into the second half . 
however , grasshopper captain Gren atoned 12 minutes later when he rocketed a 20-metre shot past Charbonnier . 
&quot; We had to be very careful after Auxerre made it 2-1 , &quot; said grasshopper coach Christian Gross . 
&quot; This is not over . 
we still have some very difficult matches remaining . 
Glasgow ( Rangers ) can be very tough . 
weakened by injury , the French champions limped into a cold , inhospitable Hardturm stadium missing five key players including striker Thomas Deniaud , who scored the winning goal in the earlier meeting with grasshopper and twice against Rangers . 
&quot; It &apos;s very disappointing that we &apos;re having these injuries at this point in the year when we &apos;re in the Champions &apos; League , &quot; said Auxerre coach Guy Roux . 
&quot; But every team has a string of bad luck at some point . 
&quot; We were eating cake early in the season and now we &apos;re paying for it . 
&quot; We didn &apos;t work hard enough in the first half . 
in the second half we did but it didn &apos;t go our way .
