the Bank of England signalled on Wednesday that British interest rates are now likely to be on hold after four successive monthly increases . 
&quot; The Monetary Policy Committee concluded that monetary policy has now reached a position at which it should be possible to pause in order to assess the direction in which the risks ( to inflation ) are likely to materialise , &quot; the central bank said in its August inflation report . 
British official interest rates were increased by 0.25 point last week , taking them to seven percent . 
the central bank gave an upbeat assessment of the prospects for inflation in the short term . 
&quot; The outlook for the next year or so is favourable , &quot; it said . 
it added that the recent policy tightening would help to keep inflation down , although it expected Britain &apos;s targeted measure of inflation -- retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments -- to pick up to around 2.5 percent two years from now . 
that 2.5 percent level is the government &apos;s official target . 
the central bank said the risks for inflation appeared to be more on the upside at the moment but it was necessary to assess the situation .
