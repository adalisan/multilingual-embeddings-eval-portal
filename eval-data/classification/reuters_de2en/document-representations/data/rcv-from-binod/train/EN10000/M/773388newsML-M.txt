Maine State Housing Authority said Friday it plans to sell about $ 60 million bonds in late August or early September , but cautioned all the details were yet to be set . 
&quot; The most likely time is 10 days or so on either side of Labor Day , &quot; said Tom Cary , the Authority &apos;s treasurer . 
&quot; It &apos;s a single-family issue , part of it could be a refunding , and part of it will be a new money piece . 
he estimated that the refunding might run from $ 30 million to $ 35 million , while the new money sale might total from $ 25 million to $ 35 million . 
&quot; Rates are very attractive right now , so the tendency is if rates stay this attractive , we might sell a little bit more , and if they go up , we might scale it back a little , &quot; Cary explained . 
some of the bonds likely would subject to the alternative minimum tax . 
the Authority planned to sell the bonds through its regular syndicate , and it was Goldman Sachs &apos; turn to be the book-running , senior manager . 
PaineWebber also fills the top spot on the syndicate on a rotating basis . 
in September or October , the syndicate also was expected to handle an approximately $ 24 million multi-family conduit offering with a variable rate . 
and a $ 20 million to $ 30 million sale of taxable bonds also was planned for that period . 
at least two more sales were expected in the fourth quarter , each of which probably would be under $ 15 million , the treasurer added .
