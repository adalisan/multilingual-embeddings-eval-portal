Britain &apos;s purchasing managers index showed UK manufacturing is on the road to recovery and , as the latest in a string of strong data , is prompting the previously unheard of notion that interest rates may have to head up soon . 
the September PMI , out on Tuesday , read 53.4 , its highest reading in 17 months with both output and new order levels recording the largest monthly rises since the autumn of 1994 . 
&quot; The recent strong data have raised the prospect of a rate rise before the election , &quot; said Philip Shaw , group economist at Union plc . 
&quot; previously , that was unthinkable . 
Shaw said the latest PMI survey confirmed the manufacturing sector is recovering , and perhaps more convincingly than many economists had expected . 
&quot; The bits that stand out are the increases in output and new orders . 
coupled with the fall in stocks we saw in the second quarter , it seems the prospects for manufacturing are brighter than had been thought . 
but the political imperatives faced by Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke , with general elections due by May 1997 and his ruling Conservative Party trailing in opinion polls , make an early monetary tightening an outside bet at best . 
&quot; The economic evidence would have to be irrefutable for him to move , &quot; Shaw said . 
there will be immense weight of political pressure against it . 
nonetheless , a manufacturing pick-up would be the final piece in the jigsaw of Britain &apos;s economic recovery . 
the service sector has shown robust growth for months now as consumer spending has taken off . 
&quot; The next few quarters could see above-trend growth , &quot; said Ciaran Barr , UK economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
&quot; Very few , if any of the indicators are pointing to anything but stronger growth now . 
the PMI survey showed growth filtering down from manufacturers supplying components to the consumer sector to now include producers of investment goods -- plant and machinery . 
investment goods producers enjoyed the first significant increase in new orders for a year in September . 
and with stocks of unsold goods now being run down , the way to manufacturing recovery is clear , analysts said . 
&quot; Growth is filtering down to most areas of manufacturing now . 
this should create a self-sustaining situation , &quot; Barr said . 
he said UK base rates , now at 5.75 percent , will be raised by up to 50 basis points , probably in the first quarter of 1997 . 
&quot; Given the recent figures , the Bank of England will only push more vociferously for a rate rise now , &quot; Barr said . 
he said inflation indicators would bottom out as growth picks up and start heading higher early in 1997 . 
the PMI prices index jumped to 44.0 in September from 41.7 in August . 
it is well below the key 50.0 level above which inflation pressure is considered to be building but is rising . 
&quot; The prices index itself is not showing anything to be particularly worried about , but there are worries for inflation stemming more generally from the pace of growth in the economy , &quot; said Marian Bell , economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland . 
Barr said Clarke could raise interest rates before the election as long as he placated Conservatives with tax cuts at his November budget . 
and a rate rise would allow him to maintain the Conservatives will run the economy better than Labour . 
&quot; Labour couldn &apos;t slaughter Clarke for raising rates , otherwise they would look like the party prepared to jeopardise the inflation target , &quot; he said . 
but other analysts remained far from convinced . 
&quot; Overall , the PMI again argues against any more rate cuts but at the same time , does not in itself call for a rate hike , &quot; said Jeremy Hawkins , senior economic adviser at BankAmerica .
