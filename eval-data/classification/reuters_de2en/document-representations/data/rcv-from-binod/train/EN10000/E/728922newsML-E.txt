South African President Nelson Mandela called on Tuesday for Indonesian trade and investment to help overcome the disparities of wealth in his country . 
he said the countries of his region grouped in the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) could also learn from the economic and technical development in the seven-member Association of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) . 
Mandela told a news conference winding up a two-day state visit to Indonesia that one of his purposes had been to &quot; encourage bilateral trade and investment , and I believe that this visit has been successful &quot; . 
he said big business in South Africa was still dominated by &quot; a minority ethnic group &quot; -- whites -- and the rest of the population participating in small and medium businesses needed investment and joint-venture partners to bring about economic equality . 
&quot; One of the ways to close that gap is to get powerful corporate bodies internationally to form joint ventures with our people so that they can have access to capital , to resources and to knowledge and to skills , to technology . 
&quot; That is the only way in which that gap can be closed , &quot; he said . 
the president added that South Africa had many advantages to offer , including good communications and advanced economic infrastructure , and was offering incentives for investment in deprived areas . 
Mandela arrived on the resort island of Bali on Sunday for a brief break after a four-day official visit to London , and flew to Jakarta on Monday . 
he was due to leave for Bangkok on Wednesday before returning home . 
the South African leader was looking worn as he addressed the news conference , and his companion , Graca Machel , said the trip had been tiring . 
but she told Reuters Mandela was in good health . 
Mandela and Suharto earlier had two hours of talks , which touched on East Timor among other issues . 
State Secretary Murdiono said Suharto and Foreign Minister Ali Alatas had explained Indonesia &apos;s viewpoint on the contentious problem . 
Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in December 1975 and incorporated it as the 27th province the following July in a move the United Nations has never recognised . 
Mandela said South Africa as a member of the United Nations was bound by resolutions of the world body . 
but he said South Africans had found that a process of dialogue was the best way forward -- and had saved his country from bloody civil war . 
both presidents agreed on the need to encourage the private sector in trade and economic dealings , Murdiono said . 
asked at the news conference about the possibility of South African arms sales to Indonesia , Mandela said he was willing to supply weaponry for external defence &quot; without hesitation &quot; . 
he also said he believed the Non-Aligned Movement ( Nam ) still had significance in the world despite the end of the Cold War , and that South Africa was researching a relevant agenda for the Nam summit due to be held there next year .
