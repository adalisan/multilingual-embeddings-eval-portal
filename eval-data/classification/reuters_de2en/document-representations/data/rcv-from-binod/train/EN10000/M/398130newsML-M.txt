that figure was above USDA &apos;s projection released earlier Monday for 64 million acres and would be the largest since 1984 . 
&quot; The talk of 65 million acres in beans was higher than before and that didn &apos;t help , &quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter . 
&quot; Funds didn &apos;t buy beans and without the big fund support we closed lower . 
USDA early Monday pegged 1998 ending stocks at 230 million bushels , above 1997 projections for 140 million , or roughly two week &apos;s supply . 
while 230 million bushels was also a historically low number , traders said the fact USDA expected stocks to build was bearish . 
soybeans closed 8-1 / 4 to one cent per bushel lower with March off seven at $ 7.76 . 
the bearish USDA data outweighed news that warehouse workers at Brazil &apos;s key Santos port went on strike early Monday over a dispute concerning back pay . 
Brazilian sources disagreed on how much the strike would affect exports . 
Union officials in Brazil said the port strike would halt 90 percent of import activity and 70 percent of exports . 
but port sources said it would not affect exports at all . 
CBOT traders said strikes are common in Brazil and usually do not last very long . 
they also noted the strike came before the busiest export months of March and April . 
Union members were scheduled to vote later Monday on a proposal by port authorities to resume work immediately , a union spokesman told Reuters . 
some traders said forecasts for rains in Rio Grande do Sul and Parana states later this week would have a bigger impact on the market than the strike . 
traders said persistent rains could further delay soybean harvest and slow exports . 
if Brazil had problems meeting export commitments in February and March , some of the business could come north , traders said . 
floor sources noted USDA &apos;s weekly export inspections data released Monday confirmed an already active shipping program . 
USDA Monday pegged inspections in the week ended February 20 at roughly 31 million bushels , above trade expectations for 24 million to 26 million bushels . 
on the day , Refco Inc sold 3.5 million bushels March and 1.5 million May . 
Griffin Trading bought 2.5 million July and R.J. O &apos;Brien bought two million May , traders said . 
in spread trade , Continental grain spread two million bushels March / July , prudential Securities spread four million July / March and ABN-Chicago Corp spread three million July / March , traders said . 
volume was estimated by CBOT at 70,000 contracts , against Friday &apos;s actual volume of 86,199 contracts .
