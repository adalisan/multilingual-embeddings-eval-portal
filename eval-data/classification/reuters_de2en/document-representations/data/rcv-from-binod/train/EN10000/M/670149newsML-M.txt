Jakarta call money was volatile on Wednesday morning on a carry-forward effect from Tuesday . 
overnight rates fell to 14.5 percent from 17.0 percent , but later rose back to 17.0 percent with an upward trend . 
dealers said the volatile market seemed to have resulted from a sudden overnight rate jump late on Tuesday following higher than anticipated weekly tax payments . 
however , the central bank offered one-week repos of central bank certificates ( SBIs ) at 13.75 percent to cool the market . 
one local bank dealer said some purchases by state banks seemed to have caused worries . 
longer-term rates were driven higher due to volatility in the short-end market , dealers said . 
one-week money was taken at 13.75 percent and one-month money was quoted at 13.25 / 13.50 percent . 
the bank offered one-week bilateral SBIs at 6.5 percent , two-week at 8.25 , one-month at 10.25 , three-month at 10.75 , six-month at 11.5 and one-year at 12.0 percent on Monday .
