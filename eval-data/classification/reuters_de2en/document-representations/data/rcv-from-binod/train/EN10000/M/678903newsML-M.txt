the Group of Seven ( G7 ) summit &apos;s economic talks offered no new factors to rattle major currency markets , which will continue to be overshadowed by intensifying U.S.-Japan trade tensions and lingering uncertainty over a European single currency , senior traders here said on Sunday . 
a senior Tokyo official attending the summit in Denver , Colorado , told Reuters that the G7 agreed on nothing extra , more or less , on currencies than their finance ministers did in April . 
Yukuo Takahashi , managing director , global trading division of Chase Manhattan Bank &apos;s Tokyo branch , said : &quot; Japan may be able to buy another couple of months to prove that its policy mix is working to reduce its surplus -- given that the G7 did not explicitly imply using exchange rates as a direct means of reducing Tokyo &apos;s external surplus . 
in a White House interview with Japan &apos;s Fuji television network just before leaving for Denver , U.S. President Bill Clinton said that exchange rates should not be used as a way of correcting trade imbalances . 
he added that the dollar has been strong because of the strength of the U.S. economy . 
Takahashi said the dollar is likely to move in a range of 105-115 yen in the next two- to three-months . 
it closed at 114.80 / 90 yen in New York on Friday before the summit began . 
&quot; The dollar may be bought back on Monday due to the absence of any new comment on currencies or Japan &apos;s trade surplus by the G7 , &quot; Takeshi Hanai , executive manager at the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd &apos;s International Treasury Department . 
the dollar is also likely to be underpinned by expectations that Japan &apos;s economic slowdown may be confirmed by the Bank of Japan &apos;s quarterly corporate survey , due out on Wednesday , Hanai said . 
Saturday &apos;s economic statement of the G7 -- made up of Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan and the United States -- said only that Japan has the objective of achieving strong domestic demand-led growth and avoiding a significant rise in its external surplus . 
&quot; But an uninterrupted recovery in the dollar ( against the yen ) is no longer in the interest of Tokyo &apos;s trading partners and of Japanese authorities , &quot; Hanai said . 
Japan has a strong desire not to let the dollar rise beyond 120 yen until its structural reforms have the effect of bringing its trade surplus down , traders said . 
&quot; The structural reform is not a quick fix , so Japanese authorities will have to depend on yen &apos;s relative strength to narrow the trade gap to some extent for a while , &quot; Hanai said . 
Japan &apos;s May trade surplus more than trebled from a year earlier to 738.27 billion yen ( $ 6.41 billion ) , while its contentious overhang with the United States soared 93 percent to 322.87 billion yen ( $ 2.80 billion ) . 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky both reiterated their concern over the mounting Japanese export surplus . 
Andrew Card , president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association told reporters in Denver that the weak yen remains a &quot; dark cloud on the horizon &quot; for U.S. industry , adding that the yen remained too weak . 
Japan argued last week that a U.S. estimate that Japan &apos;s trade surplus will expand to $ 130 billion in 1998 was too high . 
the prediction compared with the International Monetary Fund &apos;s estimate of $ 90 billion and an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast of $ 98.4 billion . 
but Rubin was quoted as saying that people will know whose predictions was correct when real data comes out . 
in terms of European currencies , the G7 meeting failed to provide new assurances for a European single currency . 
&quot; comments made on the Euro ( in Denver ) did not alleviate market fears that a new socialist-led French government and political and economic problem-laden Germany might overshoot a Maastricht Treaty criterion , &quot; said a European bank trader . 
European Commission President Jacques Santer said on Friday he saw no reason to worry about the effect of France &apos;s new Socialist-led government to European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) . 
the German mark will continue to be trapped by a tug-of-war between a possible postponement of the Euro and a launch of the soft Euro , with the former position pointing towards a strong mark and the latter to a weak one , he added . 
the dollar is likely to move in a range of 1.7100-1.7450 marks in the coming several weeks , he said . 
it closed at 1.7285 / 90 marks in New York on Friday ahead of the summit .
