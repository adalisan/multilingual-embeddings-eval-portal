no sooner had his father been sworn in as South Korean head of state on a &quot; clean government &quot; ticket , prosecutors contend , than Kim Hyun-chul began claiming the traditional spoils of victory -- kickbacks . 
installed in luxurious offices , he hawked himself shamelessly to the highest bidder , according to criminal charges filed last week . 
several of the president &apos;s top aides were similarly on the take . 
the black irony of Kim Young-sam &apos;s administration is only now emerging in its waning months , and at the worst possible moment for the country . 
a sleaze scandal has left South Korea rudderless as it grapples with new threats from hungry North Korea , and seeks to overcome an economic downturn . 
the Stalinist North is again Baring its teeth . 
last Thursday , one of its patrol vessels sailed into Southern waters with a fleet of fishing trawlers . 
it retreated after exchanging warning shots with South Korean naval ships , an incident that could easily have turned much uglier . 
the head of the World Food Programme , Catherine Bertini , had earlier warned that North Korea &apos;s food rationing system had nearly collapsed , and starvation was imminent . 
suddenly , the scenario of economic meltdown leading to armed belligerence by desperate Pyongyang leaders no longer seems so far-fetched . 
at home , an export slowdown and credit crunch -- the latter partly the result of the corruption scandal that has made banks more wary of lending -- have produced a domino effect of bankruptcies . 
unemployment is creeping up . 
just when South Korea needs strong leadership , the incumbent of the presidential Blue House is a lame duck , the most unpopular head of state ever . 
there would have been nothing remarkable about his son &apos;s grasping behaviour in an earlier era . 
after all , the previous two presidents had corruptly feathered their nests with hundreds of millions of dollars . 
so the very fact that the junior Kim is now awaiting trial for bribery and embezzlement marks progress , of sorts , in South Korea &apos;s democratic evolution . 
certainly , a muzzled press and tame judiciary would never have pursued the presidential family before Kim Young-sam took power as the first democratically elected civilian head of state for more than three decades . 
yet the corruption scandal is now mocking all the achievements of Kim Young-sam &apos;s administration , including the arrest and jailing of his two predecessors , Roh Tae-woo and chun Doo Hwan , for bribery and other abuses . 
South Koreans are caught somewhere between despair and anger as they reflect on the failure of a wrenching effort to cure an addiction by politicians to sleaze . 
few people believe democracy itself is threatened . 
yet flickerings of nostalgia for an authoritarian past , reflected in a new cult following for former military strongman Syngman Rhee , underline the mood of bitterness . 
at the very least , the scandal will put the issue of corruption at the forefront of presidential elections due in December . 
political analysts say the vote could turn into a referendum on the need for drastic reform . 
meanwhile , the president &apos;s woes are far from over . 
rather than make a clean start with a full apology , he has given the impression of a cover-up as he heads towards the end of his single term next February . 
Kim Young-sam has refused to bend to opposition party demands and give details of his 1992 election campaign outlays , other than to admit &quot; huge sums &quot; were spent . 
prosecutors are still digging in to claims that Kim Hyun-chul managed millions of dollars of unspent election funds through a web of secret bank accounts in the names of his business cronies . 
the crisis has expressed itself most recently in an outburst of student violence culminating in the torture-killing by campus radicals of a suspected police informer . 
three students were arrested in connection with the case over the weekend .
