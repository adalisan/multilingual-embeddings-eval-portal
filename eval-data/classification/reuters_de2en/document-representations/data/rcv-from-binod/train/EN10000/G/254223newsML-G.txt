in between a century by opening batsman Mark Dekker held up England &apos;s progress and briefly threatened to save the game . 
Dekker added 156 for the third wicket with Zimbabwe all-rounder Heath streak and while they were at the wicket there were even remote thoughts that Matabeleland might reach the victory target of 377 .
