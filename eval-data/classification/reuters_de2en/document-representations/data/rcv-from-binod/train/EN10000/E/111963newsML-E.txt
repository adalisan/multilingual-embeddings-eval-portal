these forecasts will be finalised over the coming week , but they do show that in annual terms the consumer price index , underlying inflation and the average weekly ordinary time earnings ( AWOTE ) measure of wages are all seen moderating further from their levels at the end of the June quarter . 
the median forecasts translate to an annual change in the CPI of 2.3 percent , an underlying rate of 2.5 percent and an AWOTE increase of 3.7 percent . 
in annualised terms the quarterly change in the underlying rate is seen falling within the two to three percent target band , and AWOTE is also seen coming in under the 4.5 percent level economists said was the maximum rate of increase seen as tolerable to the Reserve Bank . 
as a result , economists said results in line with the median forecasts should be supportive of a rate cut . 
stronger than expected data , especially for wages , would not necessarily rule out a November rate cut , economists said .

merchandise imports - Imports have been weak in recent months and the median forecast suggests economists do not expect the series to show any signs of renewed strength just yet . 
capital goods are seen as the key area in imports . 
having fallen heavily in June and July , they rose in August due to the inclusion of an aircraft import . 
some economists expected a small aircraft to be included in the September data . 
continued softness in capital goods may raise concerns about the budget forecast of a 14 percent increase in business investment in 1996 / 97 and so the 3.25 percent economic growth forecast .
