CBOT soybean futures were expected to open five to seven cents per bushel lower on Monday in response to soaking rains in the central Midwest this weekend , traders said . 
&quot; The rains this weekend really took care of the dry spots , &quot; said one commission house trader . 
locations in central Illinois received 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain over the weekend , and overall Illinois got one to 2.5 inches , according to weather Services Corp. 
the expected lower open has some U.S. Midwest grain dealers taking five to seven cents per bushel protection and some reported new-crop sales early Monday , cash dealers said . 
technical traders said heavy selling could occur if November soybeans fall through key support seen at $ 6.00 per bushel . 
in overnight trade on Project A , soybeans ended down 4-3 / 4 to 7-3 / 4 cents per bushel lower .
