the Netherlands &apos; liberal policy on tolerating the small-scale sale and use of soft drugs such as cannabis is likely to prove controversial during the six-month Dutch presidency of the European Union from January . 
here are some of the key policy elements . 
drugs are technically illegal in the Netherlands , but there is a policy of &quot; gedogen &quot; ( looking the other way ) when it comes to small amounts of drugs for personal use . 
the ( Dutch ) 1976 opium Act drew a line between soft drugs ( cannabis ) and hard drugs ( heroin , cocaine and amphetamines ) . 
the &quot; pragmatic &quot; policy aims to prevent health risks to users . 
the basic thinking is that if youngsters can buy soft drugs over the counter , they will be protected from the criminal underworld which peddles hard drugs . 
the Dutch argue that very few soft drug users take to hard drugs and claim their policy has not increased soft drug use . 
the Netherlands has an estimated 700,000 soft drug users . 
the Netherlands &apos; estimated 25,000 hard drug addicts ( 1.6 per 1,000 of the population , less than in Britain , Switzerland , France , Italy , Spain ) are healthier than in other countries . 
the average age of registered hard-drug addicts is rising , indicating few new young users . 
there are an estimated 1,200 &quot; coffee shops &quot; in the Netherlands . 
these are regulated sales outlets for soft drugs and have to adhere to the following guidelines : 
- They cannot advertise , sell hard drugs , annoy neighbours , admit under-18s or sell drugs and alcohol . 
- Soft drug sales are limited to five grammes per person per day . 
- Coffee shop soft drug stocks are limited to 500 grammes . 
- Municipal authorities have the power ( &quot; zero-option &quot; ) to shut all local coffee shops . 
- Amsterdam plans to ban alcohol in coffee shops and reduce the number of outlets in the city-centre &apos;s canal-belt . 
in addition , the Dutch have tightened legislation , cracking down on production of hard drugs and trade . 
measures include : 
- A clampdown on trade and production of drugs and on international drug trafficking . 
- possession , dealing in hard drugs such as the import / export of one kilo of Ecstasy ( 2,000 tablets ) carries a 12-year jail penalty . 
- sealing off homes used by drug dealers . 
- More prison cells . 
- halving the number of coffee shops . 
- More active deportation policy for foreign addicts . 
- stiffer penalties for dealing drugs near schools . 
- Pilot projects to supply heroin to seriously ill addicts . 
- No legalisation of drugs as this would reduce prices and attract more &quot; tourists &quot; .
