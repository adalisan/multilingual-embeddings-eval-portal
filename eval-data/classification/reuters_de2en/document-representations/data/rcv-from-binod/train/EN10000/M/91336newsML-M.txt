the dollar could target near term a moderate resistance level , 112.37 yen , that dates back to late January 1994 , but the greenback also faces risk of a pullback prior to release of potentially market-moving U.S. jobs data on Friday , chartists said . 
&quot; That &apos;s where the market is intent on heading , &quot; said mms International technical analyst Ken Boyer , referring to 112.37 yen . 
&quot; It &apos;s ... been such a strong market and that &apos;s relatively close by . 
it looks like we could hit that ( within the next ) day . 
Donney said the dollar could dip before the jobs figures to 110.85 yen , which represents a full retracement of the rally since early on Tuesday morning . 
separately , the dollar traded around 1.5330 marks in the afternoon , up from 1.5242 / 47 marks at the open . 
however , mms &apos;s Boyer cited potential for the dollar to form a three-day double top , with a break below 1.52 marks confirming that pattern . 
if the dollar formed a double top , the target would be 1.51 marks , which is also a 61.8 percent Fibonnaci retracement of the upturn from last week &apos;s low of 1.5005 marks , he said .

the dollar peaked at 112.10 yen , its highest level since 112.40 on January 24 , 1994 , after Japanese Finance Minister Wataru Kubo retracted comments he made in New York on Monday , which had been interpreted by foreign exchange dealers as bad for the dollar . 
on Monday , Kubo said the Group of Seven nations meeting in Washington last weekend had welcomed the recent performance of the dollar . 
he said the group sought a strong dollar , but stopped short of calling for further dollar gains . 
the dollar traded around 111.80 yen in afternoon dealings . 
economists polled by Reuters predicted , on average , that non-farm payrolls increased 166,000 in September after gaining 250,000 in the previous month . 
the jobless rate is seen inching up to 5.2 percent from 5.1 percent . 
Randolph Donney of Pegasus econometric Group said the dollar might sell off slightly before the employment numbers . 
&quot; It &apos;s an unknown variable and I think there &apos;s a lot of money out there to be swept off the table from long dollar positions , &quot; said Pegasus &apos; director of capital markets research .
