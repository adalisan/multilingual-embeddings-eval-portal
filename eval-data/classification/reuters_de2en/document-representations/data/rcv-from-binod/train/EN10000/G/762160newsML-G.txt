Nevio Scala makes his Bundesliga debut on Sunday , needing to put behind him his own immediate failure in Italian soccer and live up to Borussia Dortmund &apos;s recent success . 
as if that was not enough pressure on the new Borussia coach , Scala also has to endure comparisons with Giovanni Trapattoni -- the only other Italian coach in German soccer -- who won the league last season . 
Scala joined Dortmund when Perugia , the small provincial club he joined midway through last season after a spell of inactivity following his departure from Parma , were relegated to Italy &apos;s serie B. 
the tall Italian &apos;s arrival is the major change to the side who won the European Cup last May . 
the opening was created after coach Otmar Hitzfeld quit to take a new position as the club &apos;s sporting director . 
Hitzfeld had led Dortmund to two league titles and then capped it last season with a 3-1 win over Juventus in the European Cup final in Munich , making up for a disappointing third place in the league . 
&quot; Two league titles and a victory in the European Cup is not bad , &quot; said Scala , a coach who has never won a league title in his career although he did take Parma to the UEFA and Cup Winners &apos; Cup titles . 
&quot; Let &apos;s hope we will be just as successful this season . 
I think there are three or four very strong teams capable of winning the title and we are among them . 
Scala did not sound too worried after Dortmund were defeated by Trapattoni &apos;s Bayern last week in the semifinals of the new curtain-raiser to the league season , the League Cup tournament . 
&quot; Of course , we would have preferred to win but it &apos;s not dramatic , &quot; he said after seeing his team lose 2-0 . 
&quot; The season hasn &apos;t really started yet . 
Scala , who has a German wife and speaks the language fluently , built up his reputation by taking Parma from the second division to the elite of serie A. 
at Dortmund , he inherits a team with brilliant individuals such as central defender Mathias Sammer and playmaker Andreas Moeller , not to mention Karlheinz Riedle , two-goal hero of the European Cup final . 
however Riedle is likely to be heading for pastures new , with Dortmund saying they are considering an offer from Liverpool for the international striker . 
the English club have denied making a bid . 
even if Riedle goes to England , Scala will rely mostly on last season &apos;s team . 
his first real test is away to newly-promoted Hertha Berlin on Sunday . 
several players who had been sidelined by long-term injuries , such as Portuguese midfielder Paulo Sousa and Brazilian defender Julio Cesar , are now fully fit and should make the team even stronger . 
&quot; It &apos;s a well-organised team with plenty of talent , &quot; said Scala .
