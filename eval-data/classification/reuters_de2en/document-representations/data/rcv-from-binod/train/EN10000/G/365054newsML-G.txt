if Deborah Compagnoni can win the giant slalom as expected on Sunday , she will leave Alberto Tomba a tough act to follow when the Alpine world skiing championships move into their second week . 
Compagnoni grabbed the spotlight last Wednesday when she led home an Italian one-two ahead of Lara Magoni in the slalom event , confirming her status as the country &apos;s most outstanding woman skier of all time . 
another victory in her speciality would only enhance the 26-year-old Italian &apos;s reputation and give her five career gold medals to draw level with Tomba . 
the reigning world and Olympic giant slalom champion , who tuned up for the championships by winning the last three World Cup races , will start as the undisputed favourite but claims to be under no pressure after her slalom win . 
&quot; Everything is beautiful for me now . 
&quot; At the start of the season my goals were to win a gold medal at the world championships , win my first slalom and the giant slalom World Cup . 
it would be a foolish punter who would risk a bet against Compagnoni and according to British bookmakers few have . 
Austria &apos;s Anita Wachter who has finished second four times this season , twice behind Compagnoni , is one obvious threat but conceded that her Italian rival would be tough to beat . 
&quot; Deborah is the favourite , she &apos;s skiing great and has confidence , &quot; said Wachter , the 1992 Olympic giant slalom silver medallist . 
&quot; But my goal is to win a medal and to win gold would be a dream . 
Germany &apos;s Katja Seizinger , winner of the season opener on the glaciers in Soelden way back in October , will see her first action since suffering mild concussion in a high speed spill at last Saturday &apos;s downhill in Laax , Switzerland . 
&quot; I &apos;m racing for a gold medal , the crash has not bothered my rhythm , &quot; said Seizinger , the Olympic downhill champion . 
the greatest threat to Compagnoni could come from her own team mate Sabina Panzanini who has been twice a winner this season . 
Panzanini however , has been slowed by an Achilles tendon injury that kept her out of the last race before the championships , leaving her fitness in question . 
the task of upsetting Compagnoni will be made all the more difficult with her growing legions of fans lining the course . 
the largest crowd of the championships is expected to turn out on Sunday , most of whom will cheering Compagnoni &apos;s every turn as she lives her dream . 
&quot; When you ski slalom you are fighting the gates but the giant slalom is like music you have a beautiful rhythm . 
and it &apos;s a beat that has left most of her challengers singing the blues this season .
