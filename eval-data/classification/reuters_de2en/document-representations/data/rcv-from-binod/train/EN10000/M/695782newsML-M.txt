the zloty slipped to a five-week low against the basket on Monday as speculation and limited foreign investor sales of Polish paper created strong currency buying pressure on the shallow market , dealers said . 
some said the zloty , pressured down by small but systematic withdrawal from short-term paper by foreigners over the last several days , may stand to lose more ground on Tuesday . 
&quot; If more foreign orders don &apos;t materialise , the zloty may rise to one percent , &quot; said Jerzy Wyjadlowski of Bank Slaski SA . 
the zloty closed at 0.77 / 0.64 percent above the trading band centre , weaker than Friday &apos;s close at 1.08 / 0.97 percent , but up from intraday lows of around 0.5 percent . 
it closed at 3.2850 / 90 to the dollar , down from 3.2595 / 45 on Monday and at 1.8835 / 60 to the mark , just up from 1.8850 / 60 . 
some shorter-term foreign investors closed Polish positions after the central bank and IMF called on the goverment to quickly eliminate the budget deficit in order to avoid a Czech-style current account crisis in one or two years . 
so far the vast majority of longer-term investors , who hold large amounts of bonds , have remained sidelined , dealers said . 
at Monday &apos;s undersubscribed primary T-bill tender , all average yields all inched up with the benchmark 52-week paper edging up to 21.68 percent from the previous 21.67 . 
the 13-week T-bill rose 0.04 to 21.04 percent while the 26-week yield increased 0.10 to 21.59 percent . 
on the money market overnight rates edged lower to close at 22.80 / 23.65 percent from opening &apos;s 24.15 / 24.60 as banks found some liquidity in the early stages of the monthly reserves . 
tomorrow / next rates eased to 22.50 / 23.25 from 23.45 / 24.65 .
