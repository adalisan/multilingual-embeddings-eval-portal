the sharp fall in Japan &quot; s trade surplus in January was mainly due to seasonal factors stemming from sluggish production during the year-end holiday period , a Ministry of Finance ( MOF ) official told reporters on Wednesday . 
he added that there was no change in the general trend of a decline in Japan &quot; s trade surplus . 
the MOF official said production usually falls at the year-end and early in the New Year , which makes overall exports sluggish , while imports keep flowing in . 
&quot; usually the surplus plunges in January . 
this is a special factor , a seasonal factor . 
there is no change in the general trend of the surplus continuing to decline , &quot; the official said . 
asked whether the weakness of the yen had had an impact on growth in exports , the official said the major factor was growth in car exports . 
but he said there may also have been a currency factor in the growth of overall exports , especially those to the United States . 
overall exports in January grew 17.2 percent from a year earlier in yen value terms , which was the biggest growth since July 1996 , when they grew 17.5 percent , the official said . 
the official attributed growth in the trade surplus with the United States in January , a rise of 81.6 percent year on year , mainly to good sales of cars . 
exports to the United States rose 26.5 percent year on year to 1.55 trillion yen . 
a rise in imports from the United States of 13.0 percent to 756.87 billion yen was mainly due to imports of aircraft and audiovisual equipment , he said . 
asked whether there had been any change in the trend in trade with the United States , the official said : &quot; At this moment I cannot say . 
&quot; imports in that the value in yen terms increases immediately , the official said . 
but the impact from the same currency factor on exports , which should boost the competitiveness of exports , is lagging , so there is a temporary rise in the value of imports and a decline in the value of exports despite the weaker yen , he added .
