at least three people died on Wednesday when their vehicle exploded in the Chechen capital , Grozny , near the headquarters of hardline rebel commander Salman Raduyev . 
the blast came as Russian President Boris Yeltsin offered to resume talks with the breakaway region on a power-sharing deal , but ruled out granting it the autonomy it is seeking . 
a Reuters correspondent saw the charred bodies of three men inside a minibus which had been ripped open and overturned by a powerful blast in the breakaway Russian region . 
Russia &apos;s Interfax news agency quoted Raduyev , who has refused to recognise a peace deal struck last August between Moscow and Chechnya , saying the blast was intended to kill him . 
&quot; This was a provocation by Russian special forces carried out by Chechen scum , &quot; said Raduyev , who has regularly threatened to carry out a series of terrorist acts in Russia . 
witnesses said Raduyev , whose face had to be rebuilt after he was shot and badly wounded last year , had left the building about 15 minutes before the explosion . 
the unruly Moslem fundamentalist guerrilla raided the neighbouring ethnic republic of Dagestan in January 1996 , held hundreds of hostage at Kizlyar and Pervomaiskoye and later escaped safely though the lines of Russian commandos . 
Raduyev has survived a number of assasination attempts . 
Russia &apos;s Itar-Tass news agency quoted Chechen interior minister Kazbek Makhashev as also blaming foreign secret services for the explosion . 
but Makhashev said the aim of the bomb attack was to destabilise the breakaway region . 
tens of thousands of people were killed in a 21-month war between local separatists and Russian troops which ended in August with agreement on a Russian withdrawal . 
the sides agreed to put off for another four years a sensitive decision on Chechnya &apos;s future political status . 
Yeltsin , who is vacationing on the River Volga , said on Wednesday it was a good time to strike a power-sharing deal with Chechnya similar to those the Kremlin has with other Russian regions . 
but Yeltsin told reporters he was not ready to talk about granting the breakaway region , which is de facto beyond Moscow &apos;s control , any wider formal powers . 
Yeltsin said he would invite Maskhadov to discuss the offer . 
&quot; My plan is that we should prepare a power-sharing agreement . 
that &apos;s what we need at this stage , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But if we talk about a full-scale document we are not ready for it . 
Itar-Tass news agency later quoted Chechen deputy premier Movladi Udugov as saying Grozny would not accept any deal which could be interpreted as acknowledgment of the region remaining part of the Russian federation .
