Florida Gov. 
Lawton Chiles has expressed concern over Miami &apos;s slow progress in adopting a deficit bail-out plan , a spokeswoman for the governor said Monday . 
Chiles is very concerned that the Miami City Commission did not choose to act to raise the garbage fees . 
that was an important part of their budget recovery plan , &quot; spokeswoman April Herrle said . 
Commissioners had been scheduled to vote last week on a proposal to raise garbage fees to $ 320 annually from $ 160 , which would bring in $ 10 million in new revenue . 
concerned about voter backlash , they delayed the vote until Dec 12 . 
the inspector general for the governor &apos;s office , Jim Thomas , advised commissioners that delaying the fee hike could hurt the city &apos;s chances of balancing its budget by year-end . 
&quot; The governor just really wants to see the Commisison take action to stop the hemorraghing that &apos;s going on in the city of Miami , &quot; Herle said . 
&quot; We wanted to see some action that there is a long-term plan in place . 
the proposal to bring Miami garbage fees in line with those of surrounding cities was part of a bail-out plan that interim City Manager Merritt Stierheim drafted before stepping down on Nov 15 . 
the plan also called for wage freezes and $ 25 million of concessions from the city &apos;s four Labor unions . 
the firefighters , sanitation workers and general employees accepted the cuts but police rejected the city &apos;s initial proposal . 
they will vote Dec 13 on revised concessions . 
Miami has a $ 68 million deficit for the year that began Oct 1 . 
if it fails to stem the losses , Florida law permits Chiles to take over the city and appoint a crisis management board . 
no Florida governor has ever done that , and Chiles still wants to avoid it , Herrle said . 
&quot; That is not our preference , but we will carry out the law , &quot; she said . 
the state has already advanced the city $ 22 million of sales tax revenue it otherwise would have received over six months .
