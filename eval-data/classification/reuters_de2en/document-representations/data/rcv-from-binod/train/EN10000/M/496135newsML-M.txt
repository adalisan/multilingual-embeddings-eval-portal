European oil swaps firmed on Wednesday extending Tuesday &apos;s upturn on the back of U.S. and crude strength . 
Brent CFDs , which gained 12 cents a barrel , competed with healthier gasoline swaps , which rose $ 2 , for the role of market leader . 
gasoline swaps firmed on the back of overnight NYMEX strength and a perception that Brent crude looks reluctant to slip below $ 18 a barrel . 
refinery shutdowns and strong demand from China also contributed to the bullish picture . 
traders said May was valued around $ 195.50 a tonne , up $ 2 or so from Tuesday and a good level of business was understood concluded around $ 195.50-196.50 . 
deals were heard at $ 195.50 and $ 196.375 . 
&quot; There have been a few deals going through at this level although several of the majors are standing back , &quot; said one trader . 
June was valued at $ 193 with July $ 2 under . 
CFDs finished about 12 cents a barrel firmer for next week &apos;s dates having eased down in the latter part of the day after being pushed higher by the activities of a Wall Street trader who pushed a firmer intermonth Brent spread market . 
&quot; The trader offered aggressively this afternoon on Brent intermonth spreads and CFDs had no choice but to react , &quot; said one trader . 
next week &apos;s CFDs were valued around 54.50 cents under June with the following three weeks at 51 cents , 43.50 cents and 36.50 cents respectively . 
gas oil crack spreads against Brent were marginally firmer by about five cents from the morning with 3Q valued at $ 4.35 a barrel , 4Q at $ 4.87 and the first two 1998 quarters at $ 4.70 and $ 4.10 respectively . 
heavy fuel swaps held onto earlier gains with April pegged around $ 85.50 while May was done at $ 86.25 . 
low sulphur fuel swaps were still slow with the high sulphur barge to low sulphur cargo spread still too narrow . 
Bearish physical pressure was also evident with good supplies meeting little buying interest . 
April and May were both around $ 90-91 . 
jet premiums were steady at around $ 24 a tonne above the IPE gas oil for April and $ 1 extra for May . 
traders said there were few signs of airline buying . 
Naphtha was flat with April and May pegged at $ 190 and June just 50 cents under .
