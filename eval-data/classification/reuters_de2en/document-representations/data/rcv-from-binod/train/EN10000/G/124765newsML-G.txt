Republican Bob Dole on Wednesday attacked President Bill Clinton &apos;s ethical standards but the president ignored the onslaught in the final campaign debate , appearing confident he is headed for re-election . 
in a 90-minute town hall meeting with questions from an audience of undecided voters , Dole went straight on the offensive , lashing out at Clinton &apos;s ethics , credibility and performance and blaming him for Americans losing faith in government . 
&quot; They see scandals almost on a daily basis . 
they see ethical problems in the White House today . 
they see 900 FBI files , private person , being gathered up somebody in the White House , &quot; he said . 
Clinton , whose lead in opinion polls released on Wednesday ranged from nine to 17 points with less than three weeks left until Election Day on Nov . 5 , stuck to the achievements of his four years in office , showing cool command of his arguments . 
&quot; compared to four years ago , we &apos;re clearly better off . 
we &apos;ve got 10.5 million more jobs . 
the deficit &apos;s been reduced by 60 percent . 
incomes are rising for the first time in a decade , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But that progress is only the beginning , &quot; he added . 
&quot; What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that &apos;s out there . 
dole returned to the ethical question at least twice more , both times without provoking any reaction from Clinton . 
&quot; When you &apos;re the president of the United States , you have a public trust , &quot; Dole said . 
&quot; And you have to keep that public trust ... And I think now that trust is being violated , and it seems to me we ought to face up to it . 
later , Dole said Clinton had an &quot; ethics problem &quot; because 30 member of his administration were in jail or under investigation . 
again the president offered no response . 
three snap polls showed a large majority saw Clinton as the winner . 
in an ABC poll , 56 percent of respondents said the president had won while 27 percent said Dole had won . 
Clinton showed his mastery of the town hall format , frequently moving to within inches of the audience , embracing them with expansive gestures . 
dole , more reserved , stayed closer to the podium . 
political analysts contacted by Reuters said Dole did well but Clinton did what was necessary to protect his lead . 
&quot; Dole didn &apos;t go for the jugular . 
he inflicted a couple of flesh wounds but Clinton will put on a couple of band aids and it will be over , &quot; said John Pitney , a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College in California . 
Beverly Wall , a professor of rhetoric at Trinity College in Hartford , Connecticut , said Dole had by far the more difficult task of attacking Clinton without seeming too harsh . 
in the event , he was perhaps not as aggressive as some of his supporters would have wished . 
&quot; Clinton never took the bait and he clearly showed his analytical skills , focusing on answering the question . 
he played it safe , though those who don &apos;t like him will probably say he was too smooth , &quot; she said . 
dole seemed to stumble when he was asked whether tobacco was addictive . 
&quot; Are they addictive ? 
maybe -- they probably are addictive . 
you shouldn &apos;t smoke . 
you ought to be glad you quit , &quot; he said to the questioner who kicked a pack-a-day habit . 
Clinton said he was the first president to take on the tobacco lobby and Dole had opposed him . 
when not going after Clinton &apos;s ethics , Dole tried to discredit Clinton &apos;s claims of a strong economy . 
&quot; That &apos;s a good economy ? 
they &apos;re setting new records this year . 
we have the worst economy in a century . 
we &apos;ve had the slowest growth , about 2.5 percent . 
the president inherited a growth of over 5 percent , &quot; he said . 
Clinton quickly seized on the comment : &quot; Senator Dole just said we had the worst economy in a century . 
in February he said we had the best economy in 30 years . 
asked by a student how at age 73 he could understand the needs of young people , Dole responded with a joke . 
&quot; You know , wisdom comes from age , experience and intelligence . 
and if you have some of each -- and I have some age and some experience , some intelligence -- that adds up to wisdom . 
it &apos;s an advantage . 
Clinton came right back at his challenger : &quot; I can only tell you that I don &apos;t think Senator Dole is too old to be president . 
it was not immediately known how big an audience watched the debate . 
the TV audience for the first debate was estimated at about 46 million viewers , 34 percent fewer than watched the comparable 1992 debate . 
Wednesday &apos;s event also competed against a baseball playoff game on one network . 
dole said he was willing to hold a third debate but a Democratic official said , &quot; it ain &apos;t going to happen , &quot; and Clinton afterwards said he had participated in &quot; probably the last debate I &apos;ll ever be in as a candidate unless I run for the school board .
