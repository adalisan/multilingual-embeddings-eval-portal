Greek shares continued to head south in early Friday trading on the back of a 1.92 percent drop on Thursday on rising interbank rates , a reaction to a softer drachma . 
the one-month Athibor , the reference rate for Greece &apos;s interbank market , firmed 57 basis points to 11.50 percent on Thursday in relation to forex outflows . 
interbank rates were rangebound in early Friday deals . 
Greece &apos;s central bank intervened at Thursday &apos;s fixing to prop up the drachma selling large amounts of ecus and marks and was expected to do so again on Friday if forex outflows picked up once more . 
market participants said they viewed the correction as a buying opportunity . 
&quot; Our investment targets have not changed and we treat the ongoing price correction as an excellent buying opportunity , &quot; said Michael Eleftheriou , fund manager at Alpha Mutual Funds . 
&quot; nervousness is expected to prevail in today &apos;s trading session ... We expect the positive news on the CPI front to improve market sentiment and any further stock price weakness should be viewed as a buying opportunity , &quot; said Telesis Securities in its daily outlook . 
press reports suggested that May CPI inflation might ease to as low as 5.1 - 5.2 percent from 5.9 percent in April . 
domestic investors remained bullish despite some foreign portfolio selling Greek equities on forex nervousness . 
&quot; Foreign short-term funds monitoring the market may have opted out on the first sign of a price weakness on Thursday , &quot; said Eleftheriou . 
&quot; But this year &apos;s rally has been mostly supported by retail investors who do not respond swiftly to changes in the macroeconomic environment . 
their decision to move out of the fixed-income area was based on the long-term prospect of falling inflation and interest rates , he added . 
moderate trading volumes suggested that there was no large scale selling in shares . 
&quot; turnover figures for Thursday and early Friday are below the average for the recent period , indicating that there is no large-scale switch out of equities , &quot; Eleftheriou said . 
the Athens general index was off 1.06 percent or 17.8 points to 1,665.00 from Thursday &apos;s 1,682.88 close after 30 minutes of trading , rebounding from a low of 1,655.36 recorded in the early stages of the session .
