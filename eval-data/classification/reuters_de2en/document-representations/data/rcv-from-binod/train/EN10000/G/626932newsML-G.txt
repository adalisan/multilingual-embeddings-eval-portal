U.S. President Bill Clinton will use his commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy to begin the &quot; tough public sell &quot; of convincing the U.S. public to support expanding NATO , his spokesman said on Friday . 
Clinton addresses the graduates and their families and friends on Saturday during outdoor ceremonies at West Point , N.Y. 
&quot; In some ways , this will begin a debate that will go on now for well over a year about the merits of amending the North Atlantic Treaty so we can begin to take on the new members that we expect to admit , &quot; Press Secretary Mike McCurry said . 
Clinton and the 15 other NATO leaders meet in July in Madrid for talks that are expected to lead to invitations for other nations to join the alliance . 
Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic lead the field of 11 countries to become the first new members of the West &apos;s military alliance since Spain in 1982 . 
some members of Congress object to expansion , saying the move will increase costs for the United State and expose it to further military obligations in Europe . 
&quot; It is a tough public sell , &quot; McCurry acknowledged to reporters , noting that Clinton &apos;s &quot; principal goal is really to begin the debate on the reasons why the United States needs to remain engaged in Europe , why that &apos;s in the interest of the American people . 
McCurry said Clinton was &quot; going to really make it clear that , for every American , we are safer , more secure , and in the long run , more prosperous when we live in a world in which security is no longer something that defines the worries that we face day to day . 
&quot; The president will say essentially that the expansion of the most successful security alliance in the history of the world ... is manifestly in the interests of the American people , &quot; McCurry said . 
Clinton on Tuesday was in Paris for the signing of an agreement between NATO and Russia setting up a joint council to try and develop a consensus on policy issues and defuse Moscow &apos;s concerns about NATO expansion . 
Russia , however , will have no say in expansion of the alliance . 
NATO has said any former communist country wishing to be considered must have established democratic control of its armed forces , set up a market economy , and be attempting to make its forces compatible with those of the alliance . 
other who have applied for admission include Slovakia , Slovenia , Bulgaria , Romania , Lithuania , Latvia , Estonia , and the former Yugoslav Repubic of Macedonia .
