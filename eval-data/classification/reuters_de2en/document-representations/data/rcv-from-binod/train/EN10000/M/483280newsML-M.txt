Australian bond yields showed only minor movements against the U.S. , but continued to outperform Canadian debt . 
U.S. treasuries showed modest price gains after a fall in the prices component in the March NAPM index , which helped to negate the shock of a rise to 55.0 in the overall index , its highest level since February 1995 . 
the local market generally followed the U.S. move in the absence of any local data until Friday &apos;s February retail trade and building approvals , but even the reaction to them could be limited with the key U.S. non-farm payrolls report for March due later that day . 
meanwhile , Canadian bonds continued to suffer at the hands of a weakening currency , nearing two-year lows against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday , amid concerns that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy again and put pressure on the Bank of Canada to follow suit . 
new Zealand bonds underperformed in generally slow trading .
