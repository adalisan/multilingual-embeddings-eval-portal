Sudan &apos;s cabinet has approved a peace agreement it hopes to finalise with several southern rebel groups this week , state television said . 
it said late on Sunday the cabinet hopes to transform into an agreement by April 10 at the earliest a peace charter the Islamist government signed with four rebel groups last year . 
the charter does not include the mainstream rebel Sudan People &apos;s Liberation Army ( SPLA ) headed by John Garang , which is fighting Khartoum in the south . 
the SPLA refuses to hold peace talks with the government but since 1992 several smaller factions have left the SPLA and joined ranks with the state . 
&quot; The council of ministers chaired by President Lieutenant-General Omar Hassan al-Bashir affirmed in its regular session its support and blessing to the peace agreement reached between the government and the factions signatory to the political charter , &quot; the cabinet statement said . 
&quot; The agreement meets all demands that led to the eruption of the war in the south and guarantees political , economic and social rights for all citizens , &quot; it said . 
&quot; It opens the way for preserving the unity , prosperity and stability of Sudan . 
Sudan has been riven by civil war for almost 13 years , with the mainly Christian and animist south fighting what it sees as domination by the Moslem Arabised north . 
the four factions which signed the charter are the South Sudan Independence Movement headed by Riak Machar , the Sudan People &apos;s Liberation Army-Bahr el-Ghazal Group led by Cerubino Kwanyin Bol , the Equatoria Defence Force of Theopolious Ochang and the Independent Group headed by Arok Thon Arok . 
Mohammed al-Amin Khalifa , the secretary-general of the Supreme Council for Peace , told the television that the main outlines of the agreement are : 
-- The creation of a coordination council which will include 13 ministers and the 10 governors of Sudan &apos;s southern states . 
the council , which will be affiliated with the president &apos;s office , will be responsible for coordination between the states and the central government as well as supervising development in the south . 
-- During the transitional period , refugees will be repatriated and war-hit areas rehabilitated . 
-- After the transition period , the government will hold a referendum on the unity of Sudan or secession for the south . 
-- Guarantees for the freedom of expression , belief , thought and the press as well as human rights . 
-- Islamic sharia law is the source of all federal laws and legislation but states are allowed to enact complementary laws .
