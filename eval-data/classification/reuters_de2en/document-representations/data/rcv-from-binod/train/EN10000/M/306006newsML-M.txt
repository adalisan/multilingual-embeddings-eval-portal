an unexpected drop in implied volatility for dollar / mark options on Tuesday afternoon left over-the-counter ( OTC ) options dealers scrambling to identify the player . 
dollar / mark volatility began collapsing in late morning trade on Tuesday , despite continued mark weakness , which led some dealers to believe a large player or fund was affecting the entire curve . 
&quot; The whole curve is nine ( percent ) flat right now . 
earlier in the session , implied volatility for one-month dollar / mark options was trading at 9.5 percent , dealers said . 
&quot; It doesn &apos;t make sense . 
&quot; Somebody is selling quite a bit of Vol across the whole curve , &quot; he speculated . 
another dealer , with a U.S. firm , said the sell-off may have begun in Chicago with the sale of 3,000 February $ 0.6300 mark futures put options , and then spread to the OTC market . 
&quot; I &apos;m sure that whoever it was that was doing that did a lot more both on the floor and OTC , &quot; he said . 
one trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange said she believed the puts in question had been purchased by two firms two days earlier . 
&quot; They might have been rolling out of a position that they got in two days ago on expectations of touching , in dollar / mark , 1.60 even , &quot; she said . 
the first dealer said it was also possible that the sell-off in volatility was technical , with multiple sell orders triggered above 1.5950 marks , a &quot; swing point . 
&quot; If people are that nervous with their long positions , maybe spot is really directionally sensitive to 1.5950 . 
if the positions in the market are large enough , it could be that sensitive to small movements in spot , &quot; he said . 
however , he maintained that a single large player was a more likely theory . 
&quot; It feels like something big went through direct , &quot; a fourth dealer agreed . 
in contrast to dollar / mark , one-month dollar / yen volatility was slightly higher just after noon at 8.5 / 8.7 percent compared with 8.55 percent early in the session . 
dealers said the dollar &apos;s move above 117 yen was sending jitters through the entire market .
