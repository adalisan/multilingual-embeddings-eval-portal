Italian debt markets ended with mild gains , still propelled forward by optimism over European convergence but held slightly in check ahead of preliminary consumer prices data due at 1530 GMT . 
the February 2007 BTP wound the spread over the benchmark Bund into another record low of 118 basis points and closed 15 basis points up at 99.37 , with the actual yield 6.94 percent . 
dealers said the market was now awaiting preliminary inflation data from a further six sample Italian cities . 
five cities &apos; data released on Friday indicated inflation running at 1.5 percent year on year for June . 
if confirmed by today &apos;s data , this will be the lowest level of inflation for 30 years . 
analysts had forecast inflation at 1.5-1.6 percent year on year after May &apos;s 1.6 percent . 
few in the market expect a cut near term in the 6.75 percent discount rate but as one trader said : &quot; You can &apos;t rule it out . 
the lira gave up earlier gains against the mark to be quoted at 977.80 / 8.10 per mark compared with 976.60 earlier .
