Nepal &apos;s communists , who dominate the ruling coalition , on Tuesday renewed a demand that the government sign a peace treaty with India to replace one signed in 1950 . 
&quot; We want to have a new Peace and Friendship Treaty with India , &quot; Madhav Kumar Nepal , General Secretary of the Communist Unified Marxist-Leninist ( UML ) party , told a news conference . 
the UML , which headed a minority government in the Himalayan kingdom for nine months in 1994 and 1995 , had then proposed to New Delhi that the Peace and Friendship Treaty be updated . 
it is now the dominant party in the coalition led by Chand &apos;s Rastriya Prajatantra Party . 
the treaty requires Nepal and neighbouring India to inform each other of &quot; any serious friction or misunderstanding &quot; with neighbours . 
they are also committed in the treaty to treat each other &apos;s citizens as their own in matters of residence , property ownership , trade and commerce . 
but analysts say some provisions in the treaty are violated more often than they are honoured by either side . 
UML &apos;s Nepal did not say which provisions the communists wanted revised . 
&quot; The government should invite all political parties to discuss the subject and we will put our views there , &quot; he said . 
Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral agreed on a recent visit to Nepal that top foreign ministry officials from the countries should begin talks on the subject . 
officials said the Nepali government had written to all political parties represented in parliament to suggest changes to the treaty . 
ties with Nepal &apos;s populous neighbour have often been a prickly domestic issue in the tiny landlocked kingdom .
