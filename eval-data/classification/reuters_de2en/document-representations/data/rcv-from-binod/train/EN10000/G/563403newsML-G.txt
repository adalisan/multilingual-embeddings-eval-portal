U.N. officials were concerned on Tuesday that Rwanda might attempt to repatriate refugees in eastern Zaire in a deal with its rebel allies , following accusations from Kigali that U.N. aid agencies were to blame for the latest disasters . 
&quot; We suspect there is an unhealthy degree of cooperation between the alliance and Rwanda , &quot; one official commented after briefing the Security Council . 
Council members said U.N. agencies had no complaints about Rwanda &apos;s treatment of Hutu refugees once they arrived home . 
but officials were worried that the situation might deteriorate further if Rwanda and the Zaire rebels decided on direct repatriation without the United Nations involved . 
&quot; They ( the Rwandans ) are saying that if the United Nations can &apos;t get the job done , we will do it with the rebels and this is causing great concern , &quot; one council member said after the briefings . 
Members said they were also told that the rebels were broadcasting &quot; hate messages &quot; against the refugees and humanitarian relief agencies . 
Council President Park Soo Gil of South Korea said members had &quot; extreme concerns over humanitarian situation in eastern Zaire called upon the ( rebels ) to abide by commitments they entered into . 
in Kigali , Rwanda &apos;s government on Tuesday demanded an international inquiry into the train disaster on Sunday in which 92 refugees were crushed or suffocated . 
Ephraim Kabaija , the head of Rwanda &apos;s joint commission for repatriation , said in a statement the refugees panicked because they had heard the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) intended to suspend the trains because its transit camp near Kisangani airport was full . 
&quot; The government is strongly concerned by this act of negligence and further urges the United Nations to stop the acts that prolong the suffering of the Rwandese , &quot; said Kabaija , adding Rwanda objected to anything slowing the refugee return . 
Sadako Ogata , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees , has said that if her efforts to begin the airlift last month had gone ahead as planned , the tragedy would not have occurred . 
up to 100,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire fled into the jungle two weeks ago after attacks by what they said were local Zaireans and rebels . 
thousands have emerged in the last week , desperate to join the airlift to their homeland . 
the Hutus fled Rwanda after militants murdered more than 500,000 Tutsis in mid-1994 and feared revenge when the Tutsis took over the government .
