but Handelsblatt , in an article in its Monday edition , warned the impact of the climbing dollar , which for instance could raise worries of tighter monetary policy , has not yet been fully felt in the index . 
the index now is 1.8 percentage points higher than it was a year ago . 
the Handelsblatt indicator is based on economic reports including the IFO business sentiment index , and industrial and construction orders .
