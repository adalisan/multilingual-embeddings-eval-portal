Hungary &apos;s forint regained some of its losses against the dollar despite weakening against the currency basket as the mark rebounded against the U.S. currency in the afternoon , dealers said . 
the forint finished at 155.55 / 60 , up from 155.65 / 70 at noon but still down from 155.48 / 53 at the opening . 
&quot; The forint firmed because the dollar fell against the mark , &quot; said Inter-Europa Bank &apos;s Ervin Csengeri . 
the forint floats against a currency basket made up 30 percent of the dollar and 70 percent of the Ecu . 
the forint closed some 10 fillers weaker than the National bank of Hungary &apos;s ( NBH ) resistance level ( bid ) , compared with a five pip differential at midday . 
dealers said minor foreign currency purchases caused the forint to move inside the 4.5-percent wide NBH intervention band in lacklustre trade . 
dollar futures closed mainly firmer on the Budapest commodity Exchange , where the trading floor operates only in the morning . 
most mark maturities remained stable . 
almost all Ecu futures were steady , while yen futures were unchanged or weaker .
