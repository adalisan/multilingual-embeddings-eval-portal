Zaire &apos;s ailing and ousted president Mobutu Sese Seko prolonged his stay in Togo on health grounds on Tuesday after his flight into exile left him &quot; very , very weak &quot; , a source close to the government said . 
the veteran strongman , who is fighting cancer , arrived in the tiny West African nation &apos;s capital Lome on Sunday night on a Russian-made cargo plane from his jungle palace Gbadolite in northern Zaire . 
Mobutu , who ruled Africa &apos;s third largest country for over three decades , left his capital Kinshasa on Friday , one day before Laurent Kabila &apos;s rebels marched in triumphantly and virtually unopposed after seven months of civil war . 
one unconfirmed report on Togo television on Sunday said Mobutu had to leave Gbadolite in a hurry and that rebels fired on the plane as it took him on the first leg of his flight into exile . 
the source close to the Togolese government said Morocco or France were likely later destinations and that Mobutu &apos;s family was looking for a more comfortable plane to fly him in . 
Mobutu , attended in Togo by his wife Bobi Ladawa , had prostate cancer surgery in Switzerland in August and follow-up treatment in Europe . 
the long flights home to Kinshasa from Europe just before he was toppled left him drained and on the last such flight in March he slipped out of public view for several days . 
the source close to the government said that Mobutu had initially landed in Togo for a technical stopover but that the government had agreed , albeit reluctantly , to let him stay longer because of his state of health . 
the tiny West African coastal state is ruled by Mobutu &apos;s friend Gnassingbe Eyadema , another veteran African strongman who took power at around the same time . 
Mobutu was staying at the Lome presidential palace . 
Eyadema , who was out of town when Mobutu arrived , lives in an army camp . 
the government has maintained a discreet silence on Mobutu &apos;s presence and that of members of his close family and extended clan , up to 100 of whom were staying at luxury hotels in Lome . 
airline officials in Congo &apos;s capital Brazzaville , across the Zaire River from Kinshasa , said Mobutu &apos;s army officer son , other family members and close aides left Congo for Togo late Monday . 
officials in Togo had no word on their having arrived . 
officials of Congo &apos;s national airline Lina Congo said Captain Mobutu Kongolo and up to 100 other Mobutu clan members left the Congo capital Brazzaville on a specially chartered aircraft . 
other members of the clan stayed behind . 
&quot; Not all of them were able to go and some are still here at the airport , possibly when the plane returns from Lome it will take them as well , &quot; said one Lina Congo official . 
Congo made no official statement as to whether the family members had left . 
it was not clear who had paid for the flight . 
Kongolo , nicknamed Saddam Hussein , was an officer in Zaire &apos;s once-feared Presidential Guard , the only unit of the ragged army to attempt any real resistance to Kabila &apos;s rebels . 
the presence of so many members of the clan in Congo was an embarrassment to the government , which was close to Mobutu , but must now deal with Kabila only five km ( three miles ) away . 
the family was forced to find a chartered jet after the crew refused to fly the presidential Boeing 727 , saying it belonged to the Zairean state and not to Mobutu himself . 
Zairean rebel representatives last week urged countries , including the United States , France and Belgium , to freeze Mobutu assets . 
Austria said on Monday it had contacted leading banks to establish whether Mobutu had concealed investments there . 
Switzerland has already moved to do so .
