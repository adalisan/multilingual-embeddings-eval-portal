Greece &apos;s Deputy Finance Minister George Drys said tax revenues in the first two months of 1997 grew by less than 14.6 percent , against a budgeted target of 14.9 percent for the year as a whole . 
tax revenues rose 14.2 percent in January and press reports said they increased by a meagre 6.5 percent in February . 
Drys declined to specify the exact tax revenue figure for February . 
the deputy finance minister told Reuters that VAT revenues were lagging behind target in February because 30 percent of VAT payers would actually pay it in March due to a change in the VAT collection system . 
the finance ministry used to collect the VAT on an alphabetical order system but switched to a new system based on taxpayers &apos; identification codes this year , he said . 
Greece &apos;s general government budget deficit is projected to fall to 4.2 percent of GDP in 1997 from an estimated 7.4 percent of GDP in 1996 . 
general government current spending is forecast to rise 5.8 percent and tax revenues by 14.9 percent in 1997 .
