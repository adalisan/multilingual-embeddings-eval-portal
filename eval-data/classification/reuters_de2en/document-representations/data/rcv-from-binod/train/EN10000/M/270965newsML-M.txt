prices were mostly marginally firmer on Friday in precious metals markets denuded of interest as business settled down for the Christmas holiday next week , dealers said . 
&quot; There is absolutely nothing happening , just the professionals trading the range , &quot; one dealer said . 
gold was fixed at $ 369.20 per ounce after $ 369.00 on Thursday afternoon when gold closed at $ 368.80 / $ 369.30 . 
there was no direction offered overnight from Tokyo and Hong Kong which closed very slightly firmer and unchanged respectively . 
dealers there and in Europe confirmed that buyers came in under $ 369.00 but profittaking clipped gains approaching $ 370.00 . 
&quot; We are just seeing the professionals playing the range . 
the funds and the producers have gone on holiday already , &quot; a dealer said . 
dealers said the most conspicuous feature of the week was the fall in gold lease ( borrowing ) rates which were back under two percent for three months from nearly three percent at the beginning of the month . 
some dealers said this could be due to central bank gold being made available at a time when the institutions generally step away from the market as year end auditing takes place . 
it could also relate to producers , who had been selling borrowed gold forward to protect their profit margins , apparently winding up their sales campaigns for the year . 
one analyst compared the price and lease rate moves with December 1992 when behind the scenes the Dutch and Belgian central banks sold over 600 tones of gold between them . 
rumours of at least one central bank selling gold from its reserves have depressed the gold price for weeks . 
the market consensus seemed to be that a sale had taken place and involved 300 tonnes of metal but details would only become clear when the bank or banks involved made an announcement , probably in January , dealers said . 
the rest of the precious metals was extremely quiet with silver marked up a cent in reaction to gold &apos;s firmer tone at $ 4.87 / $ 4.89 . 
platinum held its recent gains following a short covering rally in Tokyo earlier in the week . 
it was quiet at $ 371.50 / $ 372.00 about 50 cents firmer and palladium was unchanged at $ 118.00 / $ 119.00 .
