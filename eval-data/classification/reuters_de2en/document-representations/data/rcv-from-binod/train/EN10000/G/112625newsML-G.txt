a special envoy from French President Jacques Chirac began a Middle East tour in Cairo on Saturday and President Hosni Mubarak said again that he welcomed a European role in talks on Middle East peace . 
envoy Bertrand Dufourcq , who is also secretary general of the foreign ministry , met Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Saturday evening and will see Mubarak on Sunday . 
Dufourcq will be in Israel on Monday and in the Palestinian territories on Tuesday , to prepare for Chirac &apos;s Middle East tour which starts next Saturday , officials said . 
he told reporters after seeing Moussa that Chirac wanted to consult Middle East leaders on &quot; steps that could be taken to help move the peace process forward and ensure the current negotiations fulfil hopes &quot; . 
Chirac &apos;s tour comes at a time when Arab leaders are looking to Europe to balance the perceived pro-Israeli bias of U.S. President Bill Clinton , campaigning for re-election at a time of heightened tension in the region . 
the European Union has promised to appoint its own special envoy to Middle East peace talks , with a role similar to that of U.S. special coordinator Dennis Ross . 
Mubarak told reporters on Saturday that a European role should be coordinated with the United States , which has traditionally dominated the role of mediator . 
&quot; We don &apos;t want conflicts to happen and the loser to be the cause ( of peace ) , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Europe has a role but this does not dispense with the U.S. role , because that is fundamental . 
Mubarak said he had heard reports that Chirac had spoken of an Egyptian peace initiative but he declined to comment . 
&quot; But when I meet him soon , we will have discussions , &quot; he added .
