the Cahners Business Confidence Index ( CBCI ) jumped to 67.2 in October from 64.8 in September , the sharpest monthly increase in more than two years , according to a report by Cahners Economics . 
&quot; The survey was conducted during the middle week of the month , at a time when the Dow Jones Industrial average first broke the 6,000-level , &quot; the report said . 
&quot; This undoubtedly fueled the business community &apos;s more-optimistic assessment of economic conditions , &quot; it added . 
of the 400 manufacturers surveyed , 69.3 percent rated current business conditions as &quot; good / excellent , &quot; the highest level of 1996 , according to the report . 
all but one of the seven CBCI components rose in October . 
the inventories component climbed farthest , gaining 6.5 points to stand at 57.3 . 
only product introduction fell , slipping 0.6 percent to 74.3 in October . 
more than 53 percent of respondents said they planned to spend about the same amount in 1997 as they did in 1996 on new or modernized machinery and equipment . 
only 10.3 percent said that their current plans call for spending less on capital investment in 1997 than they did in 1996 . 
the CBCI is computed monthly from a telephone survey of 400 senior and mid-level managers in the manufacturing sector .
