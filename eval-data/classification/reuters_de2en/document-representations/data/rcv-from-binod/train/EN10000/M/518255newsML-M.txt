the price of gold steadied above $ 340 on Thursday after being battered by aggressive sales earlier this week , but further gains were limited , dealers said . 
&quot; We are probably stuck in a $ 340- $ 345 range . 
rallies above $ 345 are increasingly likely to be sold , &quot; said Ted Arnold , precious metals analyst at Merrill Lynch . 
but despite the sturdier tone , a drop below $ 340 could not ruled out after a period of consolidation . 
&quot; At this stage a lot of people are covering their shorts . 
we &apos;ll wait for a few more weeks before a decisive break below $ 340 , &quot; Arnold said . 
Bullion recovered from a dive to $ 337.50 on Wednesday and was fixed at $ 341.20 an ounce against $ 339.90 . 
it was quoted a touch lower at $ 341.00 / $ 341.50 from New York &apos;s $ 341.30 / $ 341.80 . 
&quot; The problem remains when and in what circumstances will investors be sucked back in and generate some sustained price upside , &quot; said Larry Kaplan of Flemings Global Mining Group . 
news that Russia plans a new approach to precious metals marketing to generate revenue raised some eyebrows among gold dealers , but there was no price reaction . 
&quot; I think the story raises more questions than answers , &quot; said one precious metals analyst who did not want to be named . 
increased Russian sales , or limits on sales to squeeze prices , would have a more dramatic effect on platinum and palladium , which are already reeling from delays in exports to Japan . 
conversely , the analysts said , &quot; If they think &apos; we &apos;ll limit sales and get a higher price &apos; to some extent that &apos;s true ... but in palladium , above $ 160 you start to kill off some of your big markets . 
then ultimately it &apos;s going to boomerang on them . 
Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais did not say how the government intended to raise money from precious metals . 
palladium lost $ 2 on news a mission from the Russian central bank would visit Japan early next week to negotiate PGM exports . 
but dealers were not convinced exports could resume soon . 
one said contractual sales to Japan , the leading importer , might not begin until June even if an agreement was signed next week . 
silver shrugged off gold &apos;s woes and rallied four cents to $ 4.83 / $ 4.85 on speculative buying and ratio plays against gold . 
&quot; It &apos;s divorced from what &apos;s happening in gold , &quot; said Arnold . 
further challenges of resistance were on the cards , but prices must get a foothold above $ 4.88 for a positive outlook . 
platinum was quoted at $ 368.25 / $ 369.25 , up $ 2.25 .
