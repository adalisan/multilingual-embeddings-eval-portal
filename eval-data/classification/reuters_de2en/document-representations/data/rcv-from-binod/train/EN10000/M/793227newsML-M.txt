European oil swaps were mostly unchanged or slightly firmer on Tuesday , although gasoline and naphtha received more substantial boosts from futures gains on the IPE and NYMEX . 
Brent crude CFDs edged tentatively higher following a wet Brent cargo trade at five cents above the previous trade . 
next week &apos;s dates were climbed five cents to 28 cents under October with the following two weeks at similar levels . 
monthly CFDs were little changed but one broker said &quot; we lost the offers during the afternoon &quot; . 
September was bid around 34 cents under the front line IPE but offers were no better than 25 cents under , up from 30 cents under during the morning . 
a string of earlier trades were reported on jet swap differentials before the market was described grinding to a halt in late trading , values having come off $ 0.25 on the day . 
the trades were reported by brokers at $ 19.50 for September , $ 22 for October , $ 24.75 for fourth quarter and $ 25.75 for first quarter 1998 . 
the IPE gas oil expiry left little room for crack trading activity , leaving values unchanged . 
there was little or no change , either in EN590 or 0.2 diesel differentials on an extremely quiet day , brokers said . 
gasoline swap values received a fresh late boost from NYMEX gains , having already moved up on early Brent , with August moving up $ 2.50- $ 3 to $ 210- $ 211 and September by $ 3.50- $ 4 to $ 196 . 
a September swap trade had been seen at $ 193.50 in early activity . 
on a crack basis , brokers quoted gasoline at $ 3.15- $ 3.45 for fourth quarter , well up on the day , $ 3.40- $ 3.60 for first quarter 1998 and $ 4.65- $ 4.80 for second quarter 1998 , those latter values broadly unchanged . 
Naphtha swap trades were meanwhile earlier seen at $ 187 for September and $ 192.50 for August as firmer Brent crude and a well-bid physical market pushed August values up $ 2.50 on the day to around $ 193 . 
heavy fuel swaps rose about $ 1 a tonne but activity was thin as buyers failed to hit early offers , although a later September trade was reported at $ 194.50 . 
&quot; We &apos;ve been close a few times but the sellers have just been backing off 25 cents each time we get close , &quot; said a broker . 
September talked $ 94 to $ 94.50 on barges and $ 1 higher for October . 
low sulphur was also edging slightly higher as some dealers saw it undervalued against high sulphur barges . 
premiums for low sulphur were pegged around $ 5.50 a tonne for the inter months compared to a typical trading range of $ 5 to $ 20 a tonne on physical markets .
