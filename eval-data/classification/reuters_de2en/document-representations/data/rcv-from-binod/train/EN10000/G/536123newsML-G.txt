Germany &apos;s ambassador to Spain will read out a message from President Roman Herzog at a ceremony in Guernica this weekend to mark the 60th anniversary of the city &apos;s destruction by German bombers , Herzog &apos;s office said on Thursday . 
a German newspaper said the president would recognise the &quot; guilt &quot; of German soldiers for the bombing raid on April 26 , 1937 , carried out to help the nationalist forces of General Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War . 
a spokesman for the president &apos;s office declined to comment on the content of the message . 
the raid by bombers of the German Condor Legion inspired Pablo Picasso &apos;s anti-war masterpiece &quot; Guernica &quot; . 
the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper said in an advance release from Friday &apos;s edition that Herzog would apologise to survivors and their relatives . 
it said the text was intended as a message of &quot; memorial and mourning &quot; . 
earlier on Thursday , the German parliament rejected a motion to discuss the bombing raid . 
opposition members had wanted parliament to formally express its regret but Chancellor Helmut Kohl &apos;s coalition voted against a debate .
