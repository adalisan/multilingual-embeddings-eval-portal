the judge in the Oklahoma City bombing case on Thursday said prosecutors could not until further notice interview an FBI crime lab investigator and self-described whistle blower who may have information helping the defence . 
&quot; counsel for the government in this criminal proceeding are restrained from conducting any interview of Dr. Frederic Whitehurst until further order of the court , &quot; U.S. District Court Judge Richard Matsch said in granting a temporary restraining order to stop the interview . 
Whitehurst is believed to have information about operational problems at the FBI crime laboratory in Washington which could help McVeigh . 
McVeigh &apos;s lawyers charged in a court filing that the meeting could have resulted in intimidating Whitehurst . 
Whitehurst will also be interviewed for the Oklahoma City trial in a formal deposition at which attorneys for all sides will be present . 
the judge stopped a &quot; mandatory &quot; meeting that prosecutors wanted to hold with Whitehurst alone or with his attorney , who would have been obliged to sign an agreement not to disclose details of the meeting . 
she said prosecutors on Monday will file a response to the judge &apos;s order . 
she declined to characterise Whitehurst &apos;s role in the Oklahoma City bombing case or what areas the prosecutors wanted to discuss . 
Whitehurst &apos;s complaints about the FBI lab have been disclosed in confidence to the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Inspector General , which is conducting a probe , Whitehurst &apos;s attorney said in a court filing . 
in the past , Whitehurst had also complained about lab operations in the World Trade Centre bombing case .
