are you a businessman looking for generous tax breaks , lengthy tax holidays , easy loans , clean air and spectacular scenery ? 
then Tibet may be your answer -- that is if you don &apos;t mind the high transport costs , frequent power outages and temperamental telephone lines . 
Beijing has given unparalleled privileges to try to attract foreign investors to this remote , rugged , restive and poverty-stricken region . 
those policies are starting to pay off , albeit slowly , officials said . 
&quot; This year circumstances are rather improved as a result of our new policies to foreign investors , &quot; Wang Yaju , vice-director of the Department of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation ( DOFTEC ) of the Tibet Autonomous Region , said in an interview . 
he said Tibet officials approved and oversaw the establishment of 61 joint ventures between 1988 and 1995 . 
the new , preferential policies unveiled last year had already paid off with 14 new foreign investment projects approved in the first eight months of this year , he added . 
Wang said he was optimistic that a planned $ 48 million Summit Kymco Motor Co , a 50 : 50 venture between Taiwan &apos;s Kwang Yang Motors and Tibet &apos;s Summit Motor to produce motorcycle engines in neighbouring Sichuan province , would be successful . 
the plant would be registered in Tibet , pay taxes to that region and enjoy its tax breaks . 
most in Tibet &apos;s tiny community of foreign investors seemed attracted both by the tax holidays and the scenic beauty . 
for example , John McKay , from Santa Cruz , California , set up the Tibet Plateau cashmere Co with a U.S. company and a private Tibetan partner . 
the three-way partnership will process Tibetan cashmere with the ultimate goal of producing finished knitwear . 
the joint venture is exempt from income tax for the first five years after it makes a profit , and then pays only half the national rate of tax for the following five years . 
wading through the Chinese bureaucracy for the necessary permits was a frustrating and time-consuming process , McKay said , echoing the experiences of other investors in the region as well as throughout much of China . 
red tape appeared to be less entangling than in other regions , however . 
investors said they had considered the risks from possible anti-Chinese riots , but believed the profits outweighed potential losses . 
&quot; There &apos;s enough control here that it would cut off anything before it got started , &quot; said another businessman who declined to be identified . 
&quot; Tibetans are resigned to it and accept the way things are . 
Kesang Rigdol , a Nepali Tibetan who set up his Tibet Snowland Restaurant in the centre of the city last year , did not dodge the difficulties of setting up business in a land supposed to be the fabled Shangri-La . 
Rigdol owns 63 percent and invested $ 40,000 in the restaurant , which many say is the best eatery in Lhasa , while his Tibetan partner holds 37 percent and provided the site . 
&quot; Everything we were able to do was because of the policy on joint ventures , &quot; he said . 
despite the long , bitter winter that keeps away most of the tourists who are his main customers , Rigdol is already considering setting up a second joint venture , a dairy farm . 
&quot; We can &apos;t get good quality milk and cream here , &quot; he said , adding that skilled labour was a serious problem . 
Rigdol employs Nepali cooks and had hoped to teach Tibetans the skills of cuisine . 
&quot; But Tibetans don &apos;t seem to want to learn ; they are not interested at all . 
foreign trade officials said they welcomed such small ventures , but were also eager to lure bigger investments , while recognising that the lack of a railroad , power shortages and limited flights hampered their bargaining power . 
as part of a move to publicise opportunities in the vast , resource-rich but inaccessible region and escape their communications difficulties , DOFTEC is preparing to launch a site on the Internet , the worldwide computer network . 
Wang said investors in power plant , mineral resources and infrastructure were more than welcome . 
officials of the Tibet Department of geology and Minerals said they were hoping the regional government would soon issue special regulations covering foreign investment in the region &apos;s underground resources . 
Tibet wanted foreign firms to join forces in exploration for mineral resources , particularly copper , chromite , antimony and borax , said department vice-director Wang Baosheng . 
&quot; This could lead to good opportunities for them to take part in exploitation of these resources , &quot; he said . 
&quot; This place has great potential , if you invest here you will have very good returns . 
but in this field too , Tibet &apos;s awesome distances and lack of power are handicaps . 
Tibet Plateau cashmere &apos;s McKay declined to speculate on how long it would take before he could turn a profit , but said he was optimistic that a combination of quality raw materials with imported technology , easy repatriation of profits and duty-free machinery imports were a winning formula . 
Rigdol warned that misunderstandings between foreigners and Tibetans were a major pitfall . 
&quot; People expectations of each other are too high , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The important thing for a foreigner is to find a good joint-venture partner and to learn the habits and way of life of the Tibetans .
