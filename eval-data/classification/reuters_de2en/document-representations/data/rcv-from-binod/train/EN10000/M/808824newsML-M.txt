CBOT new crop soybeans ended higher Tuesday in response to government data showing only a modest improvement in the soybean crop last week , traders and analysts said . 
&quot; People were looking for a big improvement in the crop right away , &quot; said Jack Scoville , vice president with The Price Group . 
&quot; The market normally likes instantaneous gratification and it didn &apos;t get it . 
many in the trade had expected last week &apos;s scattered rains to reverse the effects of the summer &apos;s overly dry weather and were looking for a five percent improvement in the crop . 
however , the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the crop was rated 60 percent good to excellent , versus 58 percent a week ago . 
new crop soybeans were also supported by this week &apos;s below-normal temperatures in the U.S. Midwest . 
cool weather is typically associated with low oil yields , and temperatures in many Midwest states only climbed into the low 70s degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday . 
November ended 11-1 / 4 cents per bushel higher at $ 6.19-1 / 2 a bushel . 
August settled down 6-1 / 4 cents at $ 7.79-1 / 4 and other months were 12-1 / 4 to six higher . 
&quot; If we stay cool , the yields will be okay but the soybean quality isn &apos;t going to be so hot , &quot; Scoville said . 
August soybeans labored under pressure from liquidation before the contract &apos;s expiration on Wednesday at 1200 CDT . 
there was also talk that one of the large commercial firms was looking for soybeans to deliver against the August contract , floor sources said . 
on the day , Cargill sold one million bushels of November , traders said , and Refco bought 5.5 million bushels November . 
prudential Securities and Smith Barney each bought 2.5 million November . 
in options , Cargill investor Services bought 200 November $ 6.00 calls and 200 November $ 6.00 puts . 
term commodities sold 300 November $ 6.25 calls , pit source said . 
volatility in November soybeans was pegged at 19 percent . 
soybean futures volume was estimated by CBOT at 36,000 contracts , compared with Monday &apos;s actual volume of 35,034 contracts .
