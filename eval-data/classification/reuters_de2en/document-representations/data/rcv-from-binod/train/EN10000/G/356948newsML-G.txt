President Ernesto Samper slammed a U.S. drug certification process on Wednesday , saying a country with so many drug addicts had no business issuing a report card on Colombia &apos;s performance . 
&quot; Colombia is far too old to be subjected to tests , &quot; Samper said . 
&quot; There &apos;s no reason for any country to feel it has the right to discredit the battle that we &apos;ve been waging , &quot; he added , referring to the &quot; F &quot; or failing grade U.S. President Bill Clinton gave Colombia &apos;s efforts to fight drugs last year . 
that grade was prompted , at least in part , by allegations Samper knowingly received up to $ 6 million in drug money to finance his 1994 election campaign . 
as part of the annual U.S. certification process , Clinton must decide again by March 1 whether to certify that Colombia is a trustworthy partner in the anti-drug war . 
Decertification for a second consecutive year could trigger U.S. economic sanctions that Clinton fell short of imposing in 1996 . 
Samper visited this drug- and guerrilla-infested town in southeast Colombia a week after the discovery in the nearby jungle of what authorities called the biggest clandestine drug laboratory ever found in Colombia . 
the facility , which police said was guarded by Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) rebels , was capable of producing 1-1 / 2 tonnes of pure cocaine a day and 8.5 tonnes of the drug were seized there . 
in his lightning visit , under a blanket of tight security , Samper oversaw the destruction of a much smaller drug lab and personally uprooted coca plants in a nearby field . 
he said there was no reason to doubt Colombia &apos;s commitment to the anti-drug fight . 
but he also said producer countries could never do enough to halt the flow of narcotics as long as countries like the United States fail to cut down on drug consumption . 
&quot; We can &apos;t solve the rest of the world &apos;s problems or what they &apos;re incapable of solving within their own borders . 
government officials including Samper have said in the past that Colombia and the United States are &quot; natural allies &quot; in the anti-drug war because the United States is the world &apos;s single largest consumer of illegal drugs while Colombia is its top producer of cocaine and a leading supplier of heroin . 
business groups in Florida said on Wednesday they had formed a lobby to push the White House to reinstate Colombia . 
jobs and businesses in the United States would suffer if the Clinton administration fails to recertify Colombia , the Coalition to certify Colombia said . 
the group will take part in a forum in Miami on Thursday to present Colombia &apos;s case and come up with a strategy to convince Washington of the need to change its mind .
