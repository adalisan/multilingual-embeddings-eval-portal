world Trade Organisation chief Renato Ruggiero appealed on Wednesday for ministers from member countries to declare firm commitment to the global trading system at a key gathering in Singapore next month . 
the call appeared as weary envoys to the WTO battled on in a bid to agree the text of a declaration to be issued by the ministers , meeting from December 8-13 , with no sign that strong North-South differences had been resolved . 
the ministers in Singapore &quot; must use the occasion to deliver a political message of confidence and support for the global trading system , &quot; Ruggiero declared in an article published in the Paris International Herald-Tribune . 
they should also &quot; indicate their strong commitment to an action plan to prevent marginalisation of the least-developed countries , &quot; the WTO Director-General wrote . 
the former Italian trade minister , under fire from some ambassadors from emerging economies who have suggested in recent days he is pushing the agenda of the big powers , said the ministers should also look at controversial &quot; new issues . 
they would need &quot; to indicate how we should approach issues like trade and investment and trade and competition , &quot; he wrote . 
he included both topics -- together with the equally explosive trade and labour question which was not mentioned in his article -- in a draft declaration submitted to WTO ambassadors last week and which has since led to many hours of heated argument , including night-long sessions . 
some envoys say there has not been such radical division among the now 125 member countries of the trade body since it was launched in January 1995 to replace the old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) . 
Ruggiero , sensing the determination of the United States to get in Singapore more than the passing reference to the labour issue it won at the GATT &apos;s final ministerial meeting in Morocco in 1994 , has sought to shape a compromise . 
but he has been rebuked by some developing countries who say he is violating the WTO rule that all decisions must be taken by consensus in hinting he might make a personal statement covering the issues to the ministers if a text is not agreed in Geneva . 
the four major trading powers -- the United States , the European Union , Japan and Canada -- are not agreed on which of the three issues should be planted into the WTO agenda which will shape the world trading system to the end of the century . 
however , between them they want all three to figure both in the Singapore declaration and in future WTO work . 
the United States , backed by Norway , is especially insistent that a link must be established between the WTO &apos;s open trading rules and working conditions . 
but Brussels is most keen on getting discussions going on trade and competition policy , or how governments regulate business , while Japan and Canada -- backed by the EU but not by Washington -- want investment rules to be a WTO topic . 
key developing countries are resolutely opposed to any discussion , especially at Singapore , of all three . 
&quot; There is no place for new issues on the WTO Ministerial Declaration , &quot; India &apos;s ambassador Srinavasan Narayanan told one closed-door WTO session at the weekend . 
sharing his stand were Malaysia , Egypt , Tanzania and Thailand . 
the emerging economies and poorer developing states believe the big powers are trying to lever open their national markets places for massive penetration by big international corporations who could sweep local firms and investors aside . 
and they see U.S. insistence on the work conditions issue as protectionist , or aimed at depriving them of the advantage they have in a globalising economy from lower labour costs . 
they fear any discussion of the three questions would inevitably lead to binding rules that would leave them open to WTO-approved trade retaliation by the big powers , whose own labour unions believe low-wage countries are taking jobs away .
