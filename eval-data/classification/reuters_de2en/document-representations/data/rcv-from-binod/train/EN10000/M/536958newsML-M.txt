Dutch shares closed higher on Thursday , climbing from the outset on a strong dollar and hopes that future first quarter Dutch corporate earnings will show the same strong trends set by Philips and Baan on Wednesday . 
maybe they believe we &apos;re moving from an interest rate driven market to one driven by corporate results , &quot; said one dealer . 
the AEX share index closed 4.22 points higher at 763.16 , having been up to 766.74 after an opening surge on Wall Street . 
the market settled back as Wall Street pared gains , but dealers said an assault on the 779.02 March 11 high was on the cards . 
dealers said options players were using the relatively cheap derivatives instruments to take a bet on the AEX pushing up to the old high , or even past it to the 800 level , and this was having a knock-on effect in the cash market . 
that &apos;s only a five percent swing and the index was easily doing that sort of move at the beginning of April , &quot; said a dealer . 
Philips , whose announcement of a 22 percent rise in first quarter profits galvanised the market on Wednesday , closed 1.50 guilders higher at 98.50 . 
dealers said a number of analysts were targeting a share price of 125 guilders in the medium term . 
results from Baan , not an AEX company , were also strongly higher , giving impetus to the main index as they painted a picture of strong Dutch corporate health , dealers said . 
Baan shares closed 4.20 guilders up at 101.70 after it reported first quarter net income trebled to $ 12.32 million . 
Akzo closed 6.70 guilders higher at 271.70 ahead of first quarter figures on Friday . 
dealers said news on Thursday of a strong first quarter performance by the paints division of Britain &apos;s ICI also boosted the shares . 
other leaders saw KLM fall 1.40 guilders to 56.20 depressed by news of a 1996 profits slump from 50-percent-owned Martinair .
