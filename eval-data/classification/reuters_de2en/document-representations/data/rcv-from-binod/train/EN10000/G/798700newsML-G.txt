Lithuanian soldiers were called in to guard against possible anti-Semitic violence by Lithuanian fans at a European Cup soccer match against Israel on Thursday . 
the gang of 80 fans was noticed by security staff at the match venue in Vilnius after hanging a huge sign scrawled with the word Hizbollah , the militant anti-Israeli Islamic group , on a fence shortly before kick-off , and chanting &quot; Jews go home &quot; . 
witnesses said the sign was hauled down by security officials after about 10 minutes and 50 Lithuanian army soldiers were summoned to surround the fans , which included a number of rightist skinheads . 
the gang was not asked to leave but was being kept under a close watch , according to witnesses . 
the Israeli team had earlier expressed concern about security arrangements at the match , local media reported . 
Lithuania was once home to a flourishing community of Jews but the vast majority of them were murdered during the Second World War by Nazi death squads and local collaborators . 
Lithuanian involvement in the Holocaust against Jews is a bitterly debated issue locally and anti-Semitic incidents are reported from time to time .
