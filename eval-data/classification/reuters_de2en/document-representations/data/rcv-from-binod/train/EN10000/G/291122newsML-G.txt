the House vote on any punishment for newly re-elected Speaker Newt Gingrich over ethics problems has been delayed until after Jan . 21 , the counsel for the investigating panel said Tuesday . 
&quot; In analysing the time necessary for a sanction hearing and vote on the House floor , I have recommended a schedule that will allow this to be accomplished in a fair and orderly fashion , &quot; James Cole , special counsel to the House ethics subcomittee , said in a statement . 
&quot; In doing that , however , it will be necessary for the vote on the House floor to occur after Jan . 21 , 1997 . 
Gingrich was re-elected to his leadership post Tuesday with 216 of 227 Republicans voting for him , overcoming some calls within his own party to step down . 
the vote came a day before the Ethics Committee starts the process of deciding what penalty to impose on Gingrich , who has admitted bringing discredit to the House . 
he was found not to have done enough to prevent use of tax-exempt donations in a partisan political activity and to have given false information to investigators , which he has said was unintentional . 
the committee will recommend a penalty and the full House will vote . 
a reprimand would allow Gingrich to remain speaker , while a censure would mean he could remain a member of the House but would have to give up his leadership post . 
at the end of December , the committee said final House floor action on the penalty would occur no later than Jan . 21 . 
while Cole said the vote would now be after that date , he did not specify a day .
