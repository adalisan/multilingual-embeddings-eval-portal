the European Commission on Wednesday made good a threat to include only token products in a second phase of textile trade liberalisation when it unveiled a list of items to be freed next year . 
although the volume of goods exceeds the European Union &apos;s obligations , it includes products such as ski suits , corsets and suspenders -- items which the EU &apos;s main developing country trade partners are not usually associated with . 
last month European Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said the EU &apos;s offer would be modest unless major exporters showed willingness to liberalise their textile markets . 
on Wednesday he made good that threat , although the Commission -- the EU &apos;s executive -- nevertheless presented its offer as a generous one . 
&quot; By eliminating a large number of quotas , the proposal will give the unequivocal signal to our textile trading partners that the European Union is fully committed to liberalising trade in textiles , &quot; said a statement from his office . 
but it added : &quot; The absence of the most sensitive products from the proposal is also due to the disappointing response ... from supplying countries . 
under the terms of a four-stage agreement to scrap tariffs , quotas and other barriers on textile trade by 2005 , the EU is obliged this year to open its markets by a further 17 percent of 1990 &apos;s volume . 
major developing world exporters -- particularly in Asia -- are not under any obligation to open their markets in this phase but the EU has been calling for some reciprocity in order to prevent a &quot; big bang &quot; liberalisation in 2005 . 
the Commission said its list of 24 different product categories includes 19 that are covered by one or more important quotas and makes up 17.84 percent of 1990 &apos;s volume . 
but it accepted that none of the quotas of the products were currently being exceeded . 
&quot; The quotas eliminated represent only a portion of total imports and in most instances are used only partially , &quot; a spokesman said . 
the Commission &apos;s list must be approved by EU foreign ministers later this month so that it can come into effect by January 1 . 
in the penultimate phase , the EU must reduce quotas by a further 18 percent by 2002 . 
some EU countries -- notably Portugal , Spain and Italy -- have resisted attempts by the Commission to scrap quotas on certain textiles and garments in order to protect their industries . 
&quot; The sensitivity of industry and its regional impact on employment has been taken into account , &quot; he said . 
the list will have little impact for developing countries . 
generally , if quotas are underfilled , it is because the market is saturated or EU industry is competitive in that area . 
but the Commission spokesman said scrapping the quotas -- which meant also that import licences are no longer needed for those products -- meant &quot; developing countries would have an opportunity to demonstrate their dynamism and exploit a potential market &quot; . 
the list of products on which quotas are being scrapped indludes gloves , carpets , swimwear , synthetic tights , tents , rope , shawls and carded or combed wool .
