the death toll from a storm which hit Malaysia on Christmas Day has reached 162 after more bodies were found by rescue workers , the national Bernama news agency said on Sunday . 
officials said rescue work were searching for more than 100 people believed to be still missing in eastern Sabah state . 
private television channel TV3 said the missing included at least 10 fishermen who were at sea during the storm . 
rescuers led by the elite Special Malaysian Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team ( SMART ) said the chances of finding any survivors after more than three days were slim . 
&quot; We no longer expect to locate survivors trapped beneath the debris , &quot; Lieutenant Wallen Gulak , a SMART section commander , was reported as saying by the New Sunday Times newspaper . 
officials estimated that more than 100 people were still missing based on reports from family members . 
the search would continue until all the missing were located , the officials said . 
most of the bodies so far have been found in the logging town of Keningau , the worst affected area . 
other bodies were found in the neighbouring towns of Papar , Tuaran and Kota Kinabalu . 
most of the dead were of Indonesian origin . 
the national Bernama news agency said on Sunday that most of the Keningau victims were from Tanah Toraja on Sulawesi island in Indonesia . 
a mass burial ceremony for 70 was held in Keningau on Sunday , Bernama said . 
tropical storm Greg , which blew ashore into Sabah state from the South China Sea at 70 kph ( 44 mph ) on Wednesday , triggered heavy rains and floods which swelled rivers to overflowing , downed power lines and washed out roads and communications links . 
Keningau , a small logging town 150 km ( 95 miles ) south of Sabah state capital Kota Kinabalu , bore the brunt of the floods . 
officials said more than 500 houses were washed away . 
about 9,460 people were directly affected by the storm with nearly 7,000 of them placed in temporary shelters .
