- Harold Melvin , whose silky voice helped create the so-called Philly doo-wop sound , died Monday of the long-term effects of a stroke last year , the Philadelphia Inquirer reported Tuesday . 
he was 57 . 
although Melvin was the organiser and lead singer of the Blue Notes , his best known accomplishment was discovering the talent of Teddy Pendergrass , a drummer he turned into his lead singer . 
the group had several hits in the &apos; 60s but was better known for its &apos; 70s output . 
among them were &quot; The Love I Lost , &quot; &quot; If You Don &apos;t Know Me By Now &quot; and &quot; wake Up Everybody . 
as exemplified by &quot; If You Don &apos;t Know Me , &quot; the Blue Notes were backed by an orchestral sound but relied heavily on the strength of lead singer Pendergrass &apos; raw emotion . 
the group &apos;s fortunes declined after Pendergrass left in 1975 for a solo career . 
they remained popular overseas , however . 
Melvin was preparing for a tour in Japan when he was striken last July . 
family members told the Philadelphia Inquirer that Melvin spent his last weeks at home in bed enjoying tapes of his old hits and television appearances .
