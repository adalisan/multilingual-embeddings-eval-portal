Albanian Socialists , forced to turn back by armed bands on the way to an election rally in the north , managed on a second attempt on Wednesday to hold a tense meeting to the sound of gunfire . 
leaders including Fatos Nano addressed a small crowd in the town square littered with spent cartridges at Rreshen , some 80 km ( 50 Miles ) north of the capital Tirana . 
supporters shouted &quot; From north to south , Albania is united &quot; while protesters fired into the air . 
a handful of onlookers watched from apartment windows , but the crowd did not disperse even though at one stage there was a volley of machine-gun fire from a passing car . 
campaigning for Albania &apos;s snap June 29 elections is becoming more dangerous for both the Socialists and President Sali Berisha &apos;s Democratic Party , as the main parties try to penetrate potentially hostile territory . 
with parts of the country out of government control , rebel groups have warned some Democrats to stay away from some southern towns , and a car carrying Socialist officials in the north was shot at earlier this week . 
Albania &apos;s state news agency ATA said the Socialist rally , initially planned for Wednesday morning , was called off after Nano &apos;s convoy failed to arrive at the town . 
Socialist party spokesman Kastriot Islami told Reuters that armed bands shooting in the air had forced the convoy to turn back , saying they would not let Socialists into the north . 
Prime Minister Bashkim Fino &apos;s spokesman said the interior ministry had promised to intervene in response to Socialist complaints . 
police in flak jackets kept a low-profile presence at the 20-minute meeting , once intervening to calm a dispute . 
&quot; This town is divided between supporters for the Democrats and Socialists , &quot; resident Tom Ndoka , 35 , told Reuters . 
&quot; The Democrats think they have more support in the town , but even they do not agree with these attempts to spoil the rally . 
after the meeting a group of cars , their occupants again firing into the air , escorted the Socialists &apos; convoy as it sped out of the town . 
despite mounting tensions as elections near , many Albanians insist that broad support for both main parties is not divided over a north-south &quot; front &quot; in the country . 
the Democratic party has , for instance , campaigned peacefully in the southern town of Korce , as have Socialists in the northern town of Kukes .
