CSCE cocoa futures rose to their highest level in a month on Tuesday , bolstered by widespread short-covering by speculators , market sources said . 
may futures gained $ 21 a tonne , to close at $ 1,336 , ranging from a high of $ 1,338 to $ 1,316 at the low . 
traders said the previous day &apos;s breach of a recent high at $ 1,308 set the stage for today &apos;s rally . 
until then , cocoa had languished below the $ 1,300 mark for a month , as each successive upswing was met with heavy producer selling . 
&quot; Cocoa traded in a range for about three weeks , which finally convinced the market that it had reached the bottom , &quot; said Refco Inc analyst Ann Prendergast . 
&quot; speculators who were quite short in the market had to cover . 
signs that consumption remains strong , coupled with ongoing concerns that hot weather in the Ivory Coast could harm the country &apos;s midcrop , gave the market a more bullish tone , she said . 
the May contract would likely encounter stiff resistance toward $ 1,353 , she cautioned , adding that surprisingly strong arrivals in the Ivory Coast would keep prices under $ 1,400 a tonne . 
volume on the exchange was estimated at 11,593 lots , compared with 9,996 lots on Monday .
