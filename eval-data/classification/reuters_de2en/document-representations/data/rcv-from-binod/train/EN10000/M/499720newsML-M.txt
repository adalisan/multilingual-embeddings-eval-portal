Thai rice prices continued to dip this week as demand dried up ahead of Thailand &apos;s traditional new year and water festival holidays this weekend , trade sources said on Thursday . 
traders said Iran entered the market again to make inquiries after it bought 60,000 tonnes of 100 percent B grade last week but did not place any new orders . 
&quot; We heard they also went to Vietnam and could buy a substantial amount .. like 200,000 tonnes . 
however , most exporters still believe the country will buy no less than 100,000 from us , &quot; said one trader . 
otherwise the market was almost void of activity as buyers were sidelined by prices which , although lower , were still considered high , and as some businesses had already closed for the festival . 
the Songkran festival holiday starts this weekend and lasts until Tuesday . 
&quot; Prices are likely to ease further in the next few weeks before buyers emerge again , &quot; said another trader with a major Thai exporting firm . 
but 100 percent fragrant rice remained steady at $ 670-690 per tonne on the same basis although a few traders quoted as low as $ 650 . 
at Thai ports , there were no new declarations for rice loading . 
the 12 vessels that were here last week were still slowly loading rice as the pace was hampered by unseasonably early rainfall . 
Thailand exported 1.16 million tonnes of rice between January 1-April 9 compared with 1.62 million in the same period last year .
