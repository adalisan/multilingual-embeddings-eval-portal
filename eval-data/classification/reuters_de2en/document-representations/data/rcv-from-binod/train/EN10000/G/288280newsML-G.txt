a navy boat patrolled South Africa &apos;s notorious Robben Island jail on Monday , not to prevent escapes but to guard against invasion by tourists . 
Andre Odendaal , administrator of the island which formally became a museum on January 1 , said the navy would ensure there was no repeat of an attempt on Saturday by five private charter boats to land tourists illegally . 
&quot; The navy is there , but the main thing is that public opinion has swung against the boat operators , &quot; he said in a telephone interview . 
Robben Island , where President Nelson Mandela was jailed as a &quot; terrorist &quot; for 18 years , has been transferred from the prisons department to the ministry of arts and culture for preservation as a monument to the anti-apartheid struggle . 
the government began tourist trips to the island from Cape Town on New Year &apos;s Day but is barring access to private tour operators . 
tour operators defied Odendaal &apos;s administration on Saturday and sailed into the island harbour but authorities prohibited foreign and local tourists from disembarking . 
&quot; Our priority is to protect the historical integrity of the island , &quot; Odendaal said . 
&quot; If we allow hundreds of tourists to roam the island uncontrolled we could undo centuries of conservation in one day . 
the island became a prison in 1960 and was used to keep leaders of black liberation movements in isolation . 
Mandela was among those forced to break rocks in a Robben Island quarry .
