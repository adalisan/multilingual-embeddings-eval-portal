the Philippine peso slipped in tepid trading on Tuesday as banks awaited a clearer picture on the situation of currencies in the region , traders said . 
the limited presence of the central bank in the market also nudged the peso lower , they said . 
the peso ended at 28.50 from 28.479 , with volume thin at $ 12 million from $ 114.8 million . 
&quot; We &apos;re waiting for something more fundamental . 
there is no clear trend yet from the regionals &quot; one trader said . 
in recent months , the peso has fallen prey to the currency volatility in the region . 
traders said the central bank only sold $ 8 million at 28.48 pesos compared with about $ 70 million the previous day . 
banks said there was no incentive to trade with the non-participation of foreign banks . 
foreign banks with large dollar demand were requested by the central bank not to participate in the market to ease the pressure from the peso . 
instead , the central bank will meet their requirements by selling dollar forward contracts . 
the peso could weaken further to 29 pesos if the central bank does not unload more dollars to meet import requirements . 
traders said .
