Spain &apos;s Conchita Martinez kept on course for her fifth successive Italian Open title on Thursday , cruising into the quarter-finals with the rain more of an obstacle than Russian 12th seed Elena Likhovtseva . 
the third seed , who has dropped only eight games from two matches so far , won 6-2 6-1 against an opponent playing her first tournament at the clay court Foro Italico and meeting Martinez for the first time in her career . 
Drizzle and occasional heavy showers had delayed the start of the third-round matches by almost five hours as staff removed and then replaced the court covers . 
when play eventually started it was suspended again after just under an hour as the skies opened once more . 
by then Martinez was already leading 6-2 2-0 . 
play resumed again 40 minutes later in front of rows of empty seats and a few hardy supporters . 
the Spaniard &apos;s opponent in the quarter-finals will be unseeded South African Joannette Kruger , who got through to the last eight in 1995 as well before injury hit her career . 
Kruger knocked out eighth-seeded Slovak Karina Habsudova 6-2 6-4 to oust her second name player of the tournament . 
the 23-year-old , ranked 121st in the world , beat Dutch ninth seed Brenda Schultz McCarthy 6-2 7-5 in the previous round and appeared unconcerned at the prospect of Martinez , despite having been beaten on both their previous encounters . 
&quot; The first time I had a lot of opportunities to beat her , &quot; Kruger said . 
&quot; She &apos;s going to have to beat me , I &apos;m not going to give the match to her . 
&quot; She has the pressure on her because she has won here so many times . 
second seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario , seeking her first title of the year , joined her compatriot Martinez in the quarter-finals after a tougher game against 13th seeded Belgian Sabine Appelmans . 
Sanchez won 6-3 6-4 . 
she now plays unseeded Swiss Patty Schnyder , who edged out sixth seed Amanda Coetzer of South Africa 7-6 7-5 . 
Coetzer &apos;s defeat meant half the 16 seeds had fallen . 
Sanchez made an inauspicious start , losing her first service game , but then immediately broke back . 
the Spaniard then broke again for a 5-3 lead and held serve for the set . 
&quot; I played well yesterday but much better today , &quot; said the former world number one , whose poor form of late had her facing questions about the &quot; crisis &quot; in her career on Wednesday despite beating Argentina &apos;s Paola Suarez 6-2-6-2 . 
Romanian seventh seed Irina Spirlea beat Belgian Dominique Van roost 6-1 6-3 and faces either Italian wild card Francesca Lubiani or Austrian 11th seed Barbara Paulus next . 
Lubiani , who stunned and delighted the home crowd by beating German fourth seed Anke Huber on Wednesday , was scheduled for the late slot usually reserved for bigger names . 
Spirlea , who speaks perfect Italian , promptly went on a charm offensive to win over the locals , declaring her love of Rome and Italy at a post-match news conference .
