Asian physical gold buying has sunk into a seasonal slumber following the Chinese Lunar New Year frenzy and demand has not stirred despite fairly attractive prices , dealers in Hong Kong and Singapore said on Friday . 
&quot; April is always the worst month as far as gold demand is concerned , &quot; a Singapore bank dealer said , noting that buying was weak and the market &apos;s attention was on palladium . 
in Hong Kong , an official from the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society said buying had eased after the Lunar New Year in February . 
&quot; People have spent a lot of money ( for the Lunar New Year ) . 
it &apos;s normal that they stop buying for a while , &quot; the official said . 
he said that demand also depended on whether jewellery houses replenished depleted stocks immediately or whether they decided to wait , anticipating the seasonal dip . 
Singapore traders said gold demand in Chinese areas of north Asia , Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent had died down , especially when compared to the frenetic pace seen about two months ago . 
retail jewellers both in Hong Kong and Singapore said the pace of gold buying had been lacklustre and predicted the listless sentiment would last several weeks . 
physical demand presented a dim picture in Hong Kong , with jewellery houses noting that buying had subsided in a post-Lunar New Year lull . 
&quot; This month is a little slow for us , &quot; said a source at one large Hong Kong jewellery company . 
on a brighter note , a few Hong Kong jewellery firms noted that low tael gold prices in April , after a volatile month in February , had helped spark some demand . 
&quot; Demand is there , with prices so low , people want to buy , &quot; said one jewellery company source . 
Hong Kong gold was HK $ 3,221 ( $ 348.50 / 349.00 ) per tael on Friday , compared to HK $ 3,398 per tael at the beginning of January this year . 
one Hong Kong jewellery company source said that in March the firm geared up marketing in China , by opening showrooms and holding exhibitions of its products in southern provinces . 
&quot; March is when summer comes in , people dress lighter and want to show off jewellery , &quot; said a company source . 
&quot; The main problem ( with Chinese jewellery ) is style , &quot; he said , noting that Chinese buyers looked increasingly to Hong Kong for high quality workmanship . 
Singapore traders said gold prices would remain range-bound between US $ 346- $ 349 over the next few weeks as a result of poor demand . 
support was seen at $ 345 an ounce . 
but I think the price will tend to be on the downside , &quot; one dealer said . 
Singapore premiums over spot London prices eased slightly to 80-110 U.S. cents an ounce from last week &apos;s 80-120 cents . 
&quot; The Singapore market is trying to keep the premiums up because they don &apos;t want to go back to the old days when the Koreans were thrashing the market , &quot; he said , referring to last year &apos;s heavy gold sales by South Korean banks and institutions which drove gold premiums down . 
another dealer said that since many banks bought their gold at higher levels , &quot; they don &apos;t want to immediately lower their premiums and are waiting for better prices &quot; .
