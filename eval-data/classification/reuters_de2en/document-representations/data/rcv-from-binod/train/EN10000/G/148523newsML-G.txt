France &apos;s Foreign Ministry said on Monday there was no truth to reports that French troops may have stepped into the confused situation in eastern Zaire where Tutsi rebels are pitted against Zairean troops . 
&quot; No ! 
&quot; was the emphatic reply from Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt when asked at a daily briefing if there was any truth to unconfirmed reports circulating in African capitals of French troops arriving in the area . 
France mounted a large military operation in neighbouring Rwanda in 1995 to halt civil strife there and twice intervened directly in Zaire itself in the 1970s to prevent rebel groups toppling President Mobutu Sese Seko . 
but military officials questioned in Paris on Monday said the only French military personnel in Zaire were instructors assigned to Zairean army schools far to the west of the combat zone . 
&quot; There are no French combat troops in Zaire , there are no French military personnel anywhere near the conflict area and no plans to send any , &quot; a senior military source told Reuters . 
officials who spoke privately said France had no intention of stepping into the Zairean tinderbox nor motivation to do so . 
they said the only possible reason why Paris might have had to mount a military operation would have been if its nationals were in danger but French and other foreign civilians had left the conflict area by themselves . 
Paris wanted the United Nations urgently to designate and send to the region a special representative who could survey the problems at hand together with European Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Emma Bonino , Rummelhardt said . 
aid agencies operating near the eastern Zaire city of Bukavu are scrambling to help some of an estimated half million people uprooted by the fighting .
