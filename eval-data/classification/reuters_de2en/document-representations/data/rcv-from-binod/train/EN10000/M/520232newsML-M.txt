Polish T-bill yields are seen inching down at Monday &apos;s primary auction , pressured by bids from foreign investors drawn by the zloty &apos;s slide , dealers said . 
&quot; yields are likely to ease as foreign investors buy Polish paper at the primary tender after buying up all available T-bills in secondary trade this week , &quot; said Bartlomiej Kumela , fixed instrument dealer at Societe Generale in Warsaw . 
dealers said investor demand could nearly double the finance ministry &apos;s 1.3 billion zloty offer with bids from foreign investors amounting to around 500 million zlotys . 
&quot; This a good time for the finance ministry as foreigners aggressively enter Polish bills , &quot; said Robert Kulak , T-bill dealer at Pekao SA . 
dealers expected the average yield of the 52-week T-bill to ease to around 21.85 percent from the previous 21.93 percent . 
in secondary trade on Thursday and Friday , foreigners bid for one-year paper at 21.88 or 21.92 percent after weeks of keeping bids around 22.00 percent , dealers said . 
dealers said the average yield of the 26-week paper would be flat or just down from the previous 21.88 percent in relatively low demand . 
yields on the 13-week paper should ease to around 21.75 percent from 21.83 percent last Monday . 
the shortest 8-week T-bill yield should form between 21.45 and 21.50 percent against 21.53 the last time the paper was issued on March 10 . 
foreigners , who over the last several weeks bought small amounts of Polish bills during a period of relative zloty strength , flooded into treasuries as the zloty tumbled 0.8 point against the basket on Thursday . 
the zloty closed the week at 2.5 percent from the parity rate , against last week &apos;s close at 3.10 percent after the central bank bought some $ 290 million through interventions on Thursday and Friday , dealers said . 
&quot; The zloty is likely to slowly rebuild strength and test the central bank &apos;s intervention levels as foreigners buy Polish paper , &quot; said Mateusz Bieniek , forex dealer at Societe Generale . 
but dealers said the zloty &apos;s upward sentiment next week would likely be met with central bank interventions to knock the local currency back below the new resistance level around 2.5 percent from the parity rate . 
the zloty closed at 2.53 / 2.46 percent from the trading band centre , flat from Thursday &apos;s 2.54 / 2.46 percent close . 
it was at 3.1385 / 05 to the dollar , down from 3.1460 / 80 on Thursday and at 1.8275 / 88 to the mark , up from 1.8215 / 35 .
