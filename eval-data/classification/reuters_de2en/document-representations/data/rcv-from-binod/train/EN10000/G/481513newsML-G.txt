Chinese community leaders in Macau have set up a committee to celebrate the return of the nearby British colony of Hong Kong to China on July 1 , a committee spokesman said on Wednesday . 
the presidium of the Macau compatriots Organising Committee for the Celebration of Hong Kong &apos;s Return to the motherland includes casino mogul Stanley Ho , prominent businessman Man Man Kei and Catholic Bishop Dom Domingos Lam . 
the committee also has representatives of major business , labour and community organisations . 
the Macau Daily News , Beijing &apos;s semi-official mouthpiece in the territory , said in an editorial that the committee would &quot; serve as a basis for preparing the festive activities of Macau &apos;s return ( to China in 1999 ) &quot; . 
the Portuguese-run territory , which Lisbon has ruled since 1557 , will revert to Chinese administration in December 1999 , two-and-a-half years after Hong Kong &apos;s handover . 
the lead up to Macau &apos;s handover has been much smoother than that for the the British colony . 
Lisbon long ago renounced sovereignty over the tiny enclave , making Macau a Chinese territory under Portuguese administration , and Beijing &apos;s views are already sought on all major decisions regarding it .
