Dutch shares closed 1.22 percent lower on Friday , above the day &apos;s lows as investors picked up special-situation stocks , but still deeply depressed by Wall Street &apos;s 94-point sell off on Thursday . 
the AEX share index , which closed Thursday at its eighth record high so far this year , finished 8.34 points lower at 676.68 , up from the session &apos;s low of 672.90 . 
&quot; This morning saw the worst of it , then the AEX traded up slightly throughout the day , &quot; said one dealer , adding gains in Akzo and KLM helped bring the index above the low , although investors remained highly nervous about the Wall Street trend . 
wall Street was trading about 27 points lower by the 1530 GMT Amsterdam close and by just after 1600 GMT had slipped even further to be 67 points down on the day . 
the New York market &apos;s translation of a strong opening on Thursday into a 94-point closing loss after breaking into record high territory spooked investors here early on . 
&quot; It all happened in the last hour ( yesterday ) and a drop like that after a record is a very bearish signal , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; Obviously we &apos;re down sharply and in my opinion it ain &apos;t over yet . 
this was bound to happen if you look at the way the market has been going up this year , &quot; he added . 
Thursday &apos;s record high close left the market at a level only the most positive analysts had targeted for the year-end . 
&quot; I think a lot of people believe world markets are heavily overvalued , &quot; he said . 
up until yesterday &apos;s close the AEX had gained 5.7 percent so far this year , adding to its 34 percent gain during 1996 . 
other dealers concurred that market sentiment recently seemed to be defying overbought signals . 
&quot; We &apos;ve been so strong lately I wouldn &apos;t even be surprised if this fall wasn &apos;t taken as a buying opportunity , &quot; said one . 
&quot; People still seem to be looking out for things that may have underperformed . 
&quot; But when it comes the selloff will be sharp and deep because it &apos;s been so long in coming , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I see no reason why the market can &apos;t dump 10-15 percent over a few trading days . 
such a move would haul the AEX back down to around or below the 600 level , clearing the decks for another advance to many analysts &apos; year end target of 670 for the AEX , dealers say . 
&quot; fundamentally nothing much has changed , &quot; the second dealer said . 
&quot; There &apos;s just a feeling that markets around the world are overbought . 
we &apos;re all going to be very curious about what happens on Wall Street , but ultimately a fairly big correction would be healthy , &quot; he said . 
Akzo shares bucked the market trend with a 3.90 guilder gain to 262.60 . 
analysts said there was no fundamental news out to affect the firm and highlighted switching out of DSM , down 2.70 guilders to 179.30 . 
KLM also helped the market off the bottom with its 2.40 guilder gain to 53.80 on news of a U.S. broker &apos;s upgrade . 
Nutricia was volatile , dropping 16.20 guilders to 260.50 before being suspended by the Amsterdam bourse . 
the firm said it was withdrawing its Miluma baby milk from the British and Irish markets after a salmonella scare . 
analysts said the move was overdone and the shares rallied to 267.00 after suspension . 
brewer Heineken lost 5.50 guilders to 293.50 after talk of a report from a Dutch bank on European beer trends , said by analysts to point to a five percent slump in sales in the coming years as Europeans pursue healthier lifestyles . 
another of the few gainers was semi-conductor equipment maker ASM Lithography , which extended yesterday &apos;s 1.00 guilder gain on Thursday &apos;s higher 1996 results and news minority stakeholder Philips was cutting its holding further . 
the shares closed 9.90 guilders higher at 121.90 on a broker &apos;s upgrade .
