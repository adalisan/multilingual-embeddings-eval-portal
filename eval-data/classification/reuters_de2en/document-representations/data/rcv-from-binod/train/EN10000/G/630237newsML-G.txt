Romania and Ukraine signed on Monday a long-delayed political treaty expected to settle thorny post-World War Two differences over borders and help Bucharest bolster its prospects for fast-track NATO membership . 
the treaty caps three years of efforts by the two neighbours to put behind them issues left over from a pact signed nearly 60 years ago between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union , under which Romania lost territories to Moscow . 
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu signed the treaty with his Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kuchma in the Black Sea resort of Neptun , 250 km ( 160 miles ) east of Bucharest . 
Kuchma was greeted with military honours when he arrived at the signing ceremony , which took place at the former summer residence of late Stalinist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu . 
the treaty will dampen arguments related to land lost by Romania under the 1939 Soviet-Nazi pact , but differences remain over borders in the Black Sea area , which both sides believe to be rich in oil and gas . 
under the 1939 Soviet-Nazi pact , Moscow annexed Romania &apos;s lands of Bukovina , southern Bessarabia and the serpent Island , now in Ukraine . 
Bucharest has repeatedly asked Kiev to denounce the pact but Ukraine rejected the move , saying it amounted to overt territorial claims by Romania . 
the accord signed in Neptun proclaims the present borders as &quot; inviolable &quot; , but it includes remaining differences in a separate agreement expected to be finalised by 1999 . 
Romania &apos;s new centrist government agreed in April to make &quot; a historic sacrifice &quot; and sign the treaty , ignoring opposition from nationalists , who have called it an &quot; act of national treason &quot; . 
the move came after western democracies suggested Romania &apos;s chances to get an early admission to NATO would greately improve if there were no border disputes with its neighbours . 
Monday &apos;s event comes ahead of a NATO summit in July , which is expected to announce new members . 
Bucharest hopes to have its candidacy considered alongside with Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic . 
several NATO states expressed open support for Romania &apos;s bid , but key members Germany and the United States have so far offered Bucharest understanding but no explicit support . 
the treaty is likely to stir heated debates in parliament when presented for ratification . 
leaders of the leftist opposition refused to attend the signing ceremony . 
Romania &apos;s press was split over the treaty with Kiev . 
the pro-government daily Romania Libera said Bucharest &quot; had nothing to negotiate with Ukraine &quot; over the territories lost in 1939 . 
&quot; The truth is a bitter one . 
this treaty was imposed on Romania . 
actually , this is the second time when Romania was forced to give up its territories , &quot; the paper said . 
the daily Curierul National called the treaty &quot; a balanced document . 
&quot; The treaty has neither victors nor vanquished . 
it can be considered a success of both countries , &quot; Curierul said .
