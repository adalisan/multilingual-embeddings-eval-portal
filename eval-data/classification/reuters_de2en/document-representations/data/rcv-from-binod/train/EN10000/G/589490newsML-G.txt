new Prime Minister Tony Blair on Friday offered talks between British officials and the IRA &apos;s political wing Sinn Fein without demanding a formal IRA ceasefire first . 
Blair made the concession on a trip to Northern Ireland , his first outside London , in an attempt to unjam Northern Ireland &apos;s peace process . 
&quot; I am prepared to allow officials to meet Sinn Fein , provided events on the ground , here and elsewhere , do not make that impossible , &quot; Blair said in a speech at a farming show . 
his offer softened a ban the British , Irish and U.S. governments clamped on contact with Sinn Fein after the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) ended a 17-month truce in February 1996 in its war against British rule of Northern Ireland . 
but Blair reaffirmed the demand of the three governments that the IRA call a new , complete truce in order to join Belfast peace talks which resume on June 3 . 
he said it was Sinn Fein &apos;s last chance to take part in the negotiations . 
&quot; The settlement train is leaving . 
but it is leaving anyway and I will not allow it to wait for you . 
you cannot hold the process to ransom any longer , &quot; he said . 
the IRA is reported to be observing an informal truce and there have been no IRA attacks since a sniper shot and wounded a policewoman last month . 
but the guerrillas disrupted the British elections with bombs and hoaxes that caused chaos on roads and railways . 
&quot; This is not about negotiating the terms of a ceasefire , &quot; Blair said of his offer to Sinn Fein . 
&quot; We simply want to explain our position and to assess whether the republican movement genuinely is ready to give up violence and commit itself to politics alone . 
initial reaction from Sinn Fein , whose two leaders won seats at the British elections , was cool . 
&quot; Our renewed democratic mandate demands that we be involved in dialogue on the same basis as all other parties , &quot; negotiator Martin McGuinness said . 
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams was expected to give a measured response in a speech on Sunday , sources close to him said . 
Sinn Fein says that it will not seek a new IRA truce until it is invited to the talks , which group Irish nationalists and pro-British Unionists , without preconditions . 
Blair sought to reassure Protestant Unionists , who want Northern Ireland to stay British , that the negotiations would not put the province &quot; on the slippery slope to a united Ireland &quot; . 
he said his government , like its predecessor , would not contemplate changing Northern Ireland &apos;s British status unless a majority , currently Protestant and pro-British , wanted it . 
&quot; My agenda is not a united Ireland and I wonder how many see it as a realistic possibility in the forseeable future , &quot; Blair said . 
his words were aimed at reassuring the 60 percent Protestant majority that Labour had abandoned its policy of a decade ago to actively seek a united Ireland by consent . 
David Trimble , leader of the mainstream Ulster Unionist Party , said the speech &quot; contained many good points , especially the commitment to the Union ( with Britain ) &quot; . 
but Ian Paisley , who heads the smaller Democratic Unionist Party , saw an attempt to placate the Irish government , whose constitution claims Northern Ireland ,
