international wildlife protection bodies said on Wednesday sharks of all species faced a growing threat of extinction and called for closer monitoring of shark fishing and trade in shark products . 
the Swiss-based Worldwide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) urged the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation ( FAO ) , whose Fisheries Committee meets in Rome next week , &quot; to take emergency action before it is too late for sharks . 
WWF said the Rome meeting , which has been called to examine the state of the world &apos;s fish stocks , would be presented with reports calling for urgent measures by governments and international organisations . 
the reports were compiled by traffic International , the wildlife trade monitoring agency run jointly by the WWF and the also Swiss-based World Conservation Union , and the Washington Centre for Marine Conservation . 
&quot; WWF is becoming increasingly alarmed about the state of sharks around the world , &quot; said Michael Sutton , director of WWF &apos;s Endangered Seas Campaign . 
&quot; Sharks are extremely vulnerable to overfishing , &quot; he declared . 
&quot; Shark fishing amounts to open season on the high seas , because very few shark fisheries are subject to any form of management by national or international authorities . 
traffic &apos;s Executive Director Steven Broad said the body &apos;s research showed a highly active trade in sharks and shark products around the globe . 
&quot; However , both the fisheries and the trade are so poorly monitored that shark stocks could be seriously depleted in some areas before management needs can be identified , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Specific and accurate reporting of shark landings and trade would be a crucial first step to provide future security for shark populations . 
WWF said that although FAO member countries reported a record high shark landing total of 730,000 tonnes in 1994 , the actual catch volume was probably much higher . 
the main shark fishing countries included Argentina , Brazil , Britain , France , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , Malaysia , the Maldives , Mexico , New Zealand , Pakistan , Portugal , South Korea , Spain , Sri Lanka , Taiwan and the United States , it added .
