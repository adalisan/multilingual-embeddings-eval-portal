Turkish banks &apos; short foreign exchange positions soared to $ 3.36 billion at end-March this year , compared to $ 2.26 billion at end-March in 1996 , the Turkish treasury said in a report . 
private banks had a short foreign exchange position of $ 3.06 billion , and that of foreign capital banks was $ 412 million at end-March , it said . 
State banks and investment banks on the other hand had surplus positions at end-March , at $ 27 million and $ 82 million , respectively , the report said . 
growth in the banking sector after a crisis in 1995 , an ensuing availability of foreign borrowings and a rise in the central bank &apos;s foreign currency reserve , which ended devaluation expectations in foreign exchange markets , were the reasons behind the rise in the short positions , it said . 
banks &apos; short positions were $ 687 million at end-1994 , $ 3.07 billion at end-1995 and $ 2.52 billion at end-1996 , it said .
