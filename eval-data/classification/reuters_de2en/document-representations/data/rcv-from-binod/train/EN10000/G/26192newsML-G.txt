a 16th minute goal from Ferenc Orosz earned Hungary all three points in their opening game in Group 3 World Cup Qualifier against Finland in Budapest . 
Orosz scored into an open goal after a terrible mix-up between the Finnish goalkeeper Antti Niema and defender Rami Nieminen . 
Nieminen headed the ball past the advancing Niemi , leaving Orosz with a simple tap-in . 
Hungary , missing four key players through injury , dominated throughout the first-half but failed to capitalise on their chances . 
twice Niemi foiled Orosz with fine saves from close-range and the Hungarians wasted several good opportunities . 
in the second-half the Finns saw more possession but without injured Ajax striker Jari Litmanen lacked punch in attack and could not break through a well-organised Hungarian defence .
