NYMEX Henry hub natgas futures mostly ended down slightly Monday in moderate trade , pressured by technical selling after last week &apos;s late rally despite firmer cash and news of some U.S. Gulf production cuts . 
November slipped 2.7 cents to close at $ 2.369 per million British thermal units . 
December settled unchanged at $ 2.556 . 
most other deferreds ended steady to down two cents . 
&quot; I think we &apos;ll see more sideways action ahead but I don &apos;t see us going a whole bunch lower because of the time of year , &quot; said one New York-based futures trader , adding technicals looked more constructive after last week &apos;s move up . 
traders said U.S. Gulf natgas production cuts as a precaution against Tropical Storm Josephine probably totaled about 2 bcfd , including 650 mmcfd on Transco , 350 mmcfd on Texas Eastern , 350 mmcfd on Trunkline and 150 mmcfd on ANR . 
but they noted no platform damage had been reported and most agreed the reductions would be temporary and have little market impact . 
at 1400 EDT , Tropical Storm Josephine , with winds of 70 mph , was 110 miles south-southwest of Apalachicola , Florida , and moving northeast at 23 mph . 
forecasters said it was likely to become a hurricane before landfall sometime Monday night .
