shares traded in record high ground on Wednesday afternoon , with Nokia up sharply after U.S. rival Motorola reported above-forecast Q2 earnings and forestries tracking stronger U.S. paper shares , brokers said . 
&quot; I think we &apos;ll stay at about these levels for the day , &quot; one broker said , with the Fox index up about 1.5 percent . 
others agreed the trend looked firm , but still hinged on how the U.S. market would treat Nokia at the Wall Street open . 
Nokia traded up 15.50 markka at 428.00 markka after touching a 431.00 all-time intraday high . 
trade in both Nokia shares was lively at almost 250 million markka . 
UPM-Kymmene rose 3.20 markka to 131.00 in hefty 160 million markka volume , and Enso traded 0.50 higher at 49.90 after setting a new 50.50 markka life-high . 
forestries drew strength from overnight gains in U.S. forest industry stocks , which boosted the S &amp; P &apos;s paper index by six percent , brokers said . 
Metra came off a sesssion high of 174.00 to trade at 171.50 , still up 2.50 in solid 12 million markka trade . 
brokers said the share had been helped by a 580 million markka engine order from Tanzania for its Wartsila NSD unit .
