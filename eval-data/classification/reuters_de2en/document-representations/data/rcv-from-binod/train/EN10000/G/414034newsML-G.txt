Wimbledon gained a hard earned 1-1 draw at relegation-threatened Coventry on Monday to maintain their challenge for a place in Europe next season . 
the London side , playing their fourth game in nine days as they press for honours in three domestic competitions , took the lead in the 32nd minute through Efan Ekoku against the run of play . 
Ekoku received a through-ball from Neil Ardley on the right flank , eluded a misjudged challenge by Gary Breen and drove his acute-angled shot in off the far post . 
Coventry equalised five minutes later when Gary McAllister sent in a corner from the left and Dion Dublin scored with a glancing header . 
Coventry , beaten 3-1 by leaders Manchester United on Saturday , dominated the game at their Highfield Road ground but had to settle for just one point , which left them 16th in the 20-strong premier league with 29 points from 29 games . 
they are four points above the bottom three in the relegation zone but have played at least two games more than all their fellow strugglers . 
Wimbledon , through to the semifinals of the League Cup and quarter-finals of the F.A. 
Cup , were happy to emerge with a point and remained sixth in the table .
