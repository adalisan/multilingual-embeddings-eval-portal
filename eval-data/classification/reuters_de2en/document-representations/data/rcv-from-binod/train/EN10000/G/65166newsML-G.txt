the United States moved a second aircraft carrier into the Gulf and flew troop reinforcements into Kuwait on Thursday as part of its military buildup to counter any threat from Iraq . 
the Enterprise turned into the Strait of Hormuz to join another carrier battle group , U.S. Navy spokesman Commander T. McCreary said . 
the U.S. Navy now has seven ships in the region capable of firing Tomahawk cruise missiles . 
a civilian aircraft carrying over 200 U.S. soldiers landed in Kuwait at about 2 p.m. ( 1100 GMT ) after a long flight from Fort Hood , Texas , U.S. Army Captain Tim Raymond told reporters . 
the troops from the U.S. Army 1st Cavalry Division were the first of 3,500 ordered to Kuwait to help deter potential trouble from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . 
the buildup is the latest of several mounted by Western forces in the region since the 1991 Gulf War ended Iraq &apos;s brief occupation of Kuwait . 
the fresh tension with Iraq started in August when Baghdad &apos;s forces intervened to help a Kurdish faction in northern Iraq . 
Washington retaliated by firing 44 cruise missiles at air defence targets in south Iraq on September 3 and 4 . 
United Nations observers said some of the missiles violated the terms of a U.N.-created demilitarised zone on the Iraq-Kuwait border . 
Raymond said that under a well rehearsed procedure the troops would quickly deploy at Adera Range , a desert exercise area about 40 km ( 25 miles ) from the Iraqi border . 
&quot; The troops hit the ground running , draw equipment and deploy in the desert , &quot; said Raymond , adding the troops were equipped with gas masks for protection against poison gas . 
&quot; They don &apos;t stop until they &apos;re in the desert and in secure positions . 
two more flights are expected to take 700 troops from Texas early on Thursday . 
the 3,500 U.S. troops will reinforce 1,200 already here . 
the buildup also includes the deployment in Kuwait of eight stealth bombers , over 20 other U.S. warplanes and Patriot missiles and B-52 bombers on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia . 
the formal mission of the Fort Hood troops is to provide training for Kuwaiti forces , but officials said they could be used in any new military action against Iraq . 
like the USS Carl Vinson already in northern Gulf waters , the Enterprise carries 55 combat aircraft plus 20 helicopters and fixed-wing warplanes including electronic warfare aircraft . 
the Enterprise &apos;s complement includes F-14 fighters recently modified to deliver laser-guided bombs . 
it is accompanied by a battle group including a submarine and other support ships . 
the Enterprise was ordered from the Adriatic Sea , where it was part of the U.S. Sixth Fleet , last weekend .
