U.S. Panhandle feedlot cattle trade Monday was mostly brisk at $ 62.00 per cwt , down $ 1.00 from last week , feedlot sources said . 
about 32,500 head sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area . 
sales in Kansas were lighter near 7,000 head . 
further bids in Kansas at $ 61.00 to $ 62.00 were passed by owners asking $ 63.00 , although there also were cattle priced at $ 64.00 , the sources said . 
fed cattle prices were pressured by weak beef prices at midday and outlooks for greater numbers of cattle coming to market the next three to four weeks , they said . 
prospects of increased cattle supplies overwhelmed earlier outlooks for prices to remain unchanged from last week at $ 63.00 , the sources said . 
several feedlot sources had hoped prices would be underpinned by firm retail fill-in demand following the holiday weekend , they said . 
cattle supplies in the Panhandle were compounded by a large showlist , which was expanded by a carryover of cattle not sold last week , feedlot sources said . 
the Panhandle showlist was estimated near 104,000 head , up 17,000 from last week . 
the Kansas showlist was pegged near 91,000 head , down 3,500 from last week .
