Mexican stocks reversed earlier losses to close marginally up on Thursday after a late spurt due to better-than-expected inflation figures , traders said . 
they noted that the session was dull for most of the day as the market awaited the government &apos;s budget proposals , however . 
&quot; Inflation figures nudged the Bolsa up towards the close , &quot; a trader at the Bancomer brokerage said . 
the blue chip IPC index ended 2.85 points up , or 0.09 percent , at 2,293.23 . 
volume was dull at 49.8 million shares traded and reflected a lack of investor interest in the market , traders said . 
Banco de Mexico announced during late trade that consumer inflation for October was 1.25 percent , which was slightly below average expectations of 1.31 percent and the lowest monthly figure since the December 1994 peso crisis . 
Thursday also saw 1997 budget proposals unveiled in congress , but said they failed to move a slothful market as they were much as expected . 
&quot; Budget guidelines were as expected , especially the forecast average exchange rate , which had caused some jitters , &quot; said another trader . 
the government expects the peso exchange rate to average 8.53 per dollar next year . 
on the broad market , a total of 106 stocks changed hands , of which losers outnumbered winners by 50 to 33 . 
the losers list was dominated by three series of shares in financial firm GFInver . 
traders said this was due to speculation ahead of an announcement of the subscription price for new shares to be issued to help finance the banking subsidiary &apos;s forthcoming acquisition by Banco Santander . 
holding company Gruma topped the leaders . 
traders noted that Gruma recently placed $ 120 million of stock . 
traders felt that budget proposals could ease uncertainty and pave the way for gains on Friday . 
&quot; We could see a market with brighter prospects and livelier volume tomorrow , now that the uncertainty over budget proposals is behind us , &quot; the Bancomer trader said . 
technical analysts situated support and resistance at 3,262 and 3,326 points , respectively , with a pyschological barrier at 3,300 points .
