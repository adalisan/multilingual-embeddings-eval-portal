Australia overhauled their back row on Tuesday when they recalled flankers David Wilson and Matt Cockbain in making four changes for this weekend &apos;s Tri-Nations match against South Africa . 
veteran fly-half David Knox and fullback Stephen Larkham also returned for the Brisbane test to fill gaps caused by injuries to established pair Tim Horan and Matt Burke . 
in a further positional switch , Daniel manu moved from breakaway to replace axed back-rower Michael Brial as selectors reacted to Australia &apos;s 33-18 loss to New Zealand on Saturday . 
Flanker Brett Robinson also lost his place as Australia selectors tried another variation in their so far fruitless search this season for an effective scrum . 
South Africa , beaten by the All Blacks in the Tri-Nations series opener on June 19 , made only one enforced change , naming prop Dawie Theron to replace Marius Hurter , who has influenza . 
springbok hooker James Dalton recovered from the calf strain that forced him to miss the All Black test but failed to oust Naka Drotske and will take his place on the reserves bench . 
&quot; Marius was left out after being unable to train at all on Monday because of the &apos; flu , &quot; a team spokesman told Reuters by telephone from Brisbane . 
Wallaby coach Greg Smith summoned 33-year-old Knox from a playing stint with South African province Natal to resume his test career . 
Smith said the ACT Brumbies goalkicker now had the opportunity to cement his international future because of Horan &apos;s lengthy absence with a broken hand . 
&quot; What you do is give people an opportunity in a position and if they perform they retain the position , &quot; Smith said . 
Knox &apos;s recall represented a remarkable , and sudden , shift in opinion by Smith , a persistent critic of the stylish standoff . 
only three days ago , Smith appeared to dash Knox &apos;s hopes again by describing his tackling and defence as weak , saying it represented too great a risk at test level . 
the local media reacted with incredulity to Smith &apos;s sudden change of heart . 
&quot; If Smith was a gymnast , his backflip was worthy of an Olympic gold , &quot; The Australian newspaper commented on Tuesday . 
in an angry outburst against Smith , former Wallaby test flanker Simon Poidevin said Australia were playing like a club side because of outdated and confused tactics . 
&quot; It &apos;s very frustrating watching the team playing like a club side , &quot; Poidevin , the country &apos;s most capped forward with 59 tests , told The Australian newspaper on Tuesday . 
&quot; The Australian team &apos;s on-field performance seems confused and at times directionless . 
ultimately the responsibility for the style and tactics must lie with coach Greg Smith , &quot; he said .
