rebel leaders in southern Albania were meeting on Friday to decide their next course of action after President Sali Berisha ignored their ultimatum to resign . 
representatives of 13 towns in the south held by rebels who rose up against the government last month were due to meet in the town of Tepelene after a Thursday deadline they set for Berisha to quit passed . 
the rebels blame Berisha for not stopping shady pyramid savings schemes that operated for over three years until they collapsed earlier this year , swallowing the life savings of thousands of families , especially in the more prosperous south . 
some rebels had called for a march on Tirana or an armed attack on the presidential palace if Berisha refused to go , but they found little support and most opted for a peaceful solution to the crisis . 
the rebels have threatened to set up a rival presidential council to challenge the president &apos;s authority in the south , which is ostensibly ruled by a loose network of citizens &apos; councils . 
in practice real control in many towns appears to be wielded by local mafias , all armed to the teeth with weapons looted from army barracks at the start of the uprising . 
Albanian political party leaders , now part of the all-party government taking the country up to elections by June , have come out against using force to remove Berisha , saying the democratic process will decide . 
&quot; We do not support any military move to overthrow Berisha . 
we think he can and should be removed by legal , peaceful means , &quot; said Social Democrat vice chairman Paskal Milo in the southern town of Gjirokaster on Thursday . 
in Tirana the government , which controls the north and is seeking to reestablish its authority over the south , is locked in a power struggle with parliament , dominated by Berisha &apos;s Democratic Party . 
late on Thursday parliament voted down a draft bill submitted by premier Bashkim Fino , of the ex-communist Socialist Party , to bring state television and radio under control of the government rather than parliament . 
Fino argued that since the new government reflected all political shades it should take over control of the media for the time being , until the current crisis had been resolved . 
however the speaker of parliament , Pjeter Arbnori , accused Fino of acting unconstitionally , saying no previous government had ever tried to take over the media . 
the parliament , in which the Democrats hold 122 of the 140 seats following elections last May which were branded seriously flawed by foreign observers and boycotted by the opposition , also blocked a government bill to lift press restrictions imposed under a state of emergency still in force . 
Tirana airport remained open after the first flight for a week left for Sofia on Thursday , but no planes were flying on Friday . 
Albanian Airlines , which had promised to resume scheduled services on Friday with flights to Rome and Bologna , said the plane that flew to Sofia was undergoing repairs in the Bulgarian capital . 
Western airlines have said they will not resume services until Monday at the earliest .
