Austria &apos;s Barbara Schett captured her second career title on Sunday by beating Slovakia &apos;s Henrieta Nagyova at the Styria Open . 
Fifth-seeded Schett struggled but then stepped up a gear to take the $ 107,500 clay court tournament 3-6 6-2 6-3 in a little over an hour and a half . 
Sixth-seeded Nagyova , who lost her second final in a fortnight after bowing to Austria &apos;s Barbara Paulus in Warsaw last week , looked tired after the first set . 
things would have been a lot easier had I managed a break in the second game of the first set , &quot; said 39th-ranked Schett . 
&quot; This victory is fantastic because I came here without any great expectations . 
the Austrian , who won the tournament in Palermo last year , will next play in Atlanta to prepare for the U.S. Open starting on August 25 .
