Chris Boardman erased painful memories when he took the Tour de France leader &apos;s yellow jersey with a brilliant victory in the prologue on Saturday . 
three years after winning his first Tour prologue , the Briton once again confirmed he was the world &apos;s best time trial specialist with a ride of eight minutes 20.90 seconds on a flat 7.3-km course in the streets of Rouen in the north of France . 
Boardman &apos;s win was all the more convincing as his nearest rival in this year &apos;s prologue , German Jan Ullrich , started two hours before him in far better conditions . 
Ullrich , second in the 1996 Tour behind Denmark &apos;s Bjarne Riis , was two seconds slower than the Gan rider with Russia &apos;s Yevgeny Berzin third , five seconds behind Boardman . 
for the Briton , this was his race of the season , after the disappointment of his two previous Tour prologues . 
in 1995 , he crashed out of the race in the rain and last year he was beaten by just two seconds by Swiss Alex Zuelle . 
the pressure was immense , &quot; said Boardman . 
&quot; But this is very satisfactory . 
Ullrich confirmed he may well be the main threat to his Deutsche Telekom team leader Riis with his second placing . 
the 23-year-old German , who won the last time trial of the 1996 Tour , is obviously in great shape . 
despite entering the Tour with a broken collarbone , Zuelle also showed he could not be ruled out , finishing in the same time as Berzin and veteran compatriot Tony Rominger .
