the head of Kazakhstan &apos;s shadowy Security Council , worried by ethnic insurgency in a nearby part of China and armed Cossacks on its Russian frontier , offered a rare glimpse into the republic &apos;s security concerns on Tuesday . 
Beksultan Sarsekov , shadowy secretary of Kazakhstan &apos;s Security Council , was giving the first official reaction to last month &apos;s bloody riots by ethnic Uighurs in China &apos;s Xinjiang region which left nine dead and 198 wounded . 
&quot; We are disturbed by events in Xinjiang , &quot; Sarsekov told a news conference . 
&quot; The Chinese authorities are resorting to harsh measures ... We can as human beings feel and understand ( the Uighurs ) . 
speaking before a summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Moscow on Friday , Sarsekov also accused Russia of breaking the spirit of a customs union by placing armed Cossack units along their common frontier . 
we have long hoped and still hope that Russia would be the nucleus of this integration . 
but this has not happened , &quot; he said . 
Russian foreign ministry officials were not immediately available for comment . 
the Cossacks , a warrior class of ethnic Slavs which rolled back Russia &apos;s vast frontiers in Tsarist times , are only a shadow of their imperial ancestors . 
but the presence of armed groups along the border is one factor behind Kazakhstan &apos;s decision to move its capital to its desolate northern steppeland , staking a political claim to land which many Russians believe is theirs . 
caution had so far been the watchword in Kazakhstan &apos;s relations with its mighty Russian and Chinese neighbours . 
but ethnic unrest in China &apos;s northwest province of Xinjiang and a trade row brewing with Russia have sent ripples of tension across the usual glacial calm in ties with the two states . 
the Uighurs and Kazakhs share the region &apos;s Turkic language , the Moslem faith and a nomadic past , and Kazakhstan &apos;s new found independence has fuelled the Uighurs &apos; own separatist dreams . 
but Kazakh officials are uneasy about the presence on its territory of active , noisy Uighur exile groups , which espouse an armed struggle with China . 
Almaty is due to sign a pact next month with China , Russia , Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan reducing troop levels on their common borders , and is anxious not to rock the boat with Beijing . 
the Kazakh government has repeatedly turned a deaf ear to Uighur demands that it place the restive province on the agenda in meetings with Chinese officials and Uighur groups are careful not to strain an already limited welcome . 
but there is sympathy for ethnic kin across the border . 
more surprising is Kazakhstan &apos;s increasingly independent line from Russia , ranging from trade issues to eastward expansion of the NATO defence alliance . 
Kazakhstan has a large population of ethnic Russians and relies on Russian pipelines for oil exports , and the republic is normally extremely cautious in its relations with the Kremlin . 
but during NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana &apos;s swing through Central Asia last month , Kazakhstan ignored Kremlin ire at NATO expansion , saying it posed no threat to the republic . 
fighting for title to its vast oil riches , Kazakhstan is also quietly holding its ground against Russia in a fight over who owns what in the Caspian Sea . 
but diplomats and oil executives say landlocked Kazakhstan will not test Moscow too far . 
&quot; Kazakhstan remains for at least the medium term dependent on Russia for its oil exports , &quot; one western analyst said .
