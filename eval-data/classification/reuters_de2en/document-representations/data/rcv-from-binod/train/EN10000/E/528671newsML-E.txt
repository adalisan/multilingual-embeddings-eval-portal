India can afford a rise in its current account deficit in the external sector to boost investment in the economy , former finance minister P.Chidambaram said on Tuesday . 
Chidambaram , who ended 10 months as finance minister on Monday after his regional party pulled out of the ruling coalition , told a business conference that a higher current account deficit could help economic growth . 
India needed a savings rate of around 30 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) and investment of around 32 percent to attain an intended annual growth rate of 8.0 percent , he said . 
the gap between savings and investment could be met with a higher current account deficit resulting from an inflow of foreign investment , Chidambaram said . 
&quot; There is no danger if the current account deficit rises to 2.0 percent or even 2.4 percent , &quot; he said . 
Chidambaram , a key architect of India &apos;s six-year-old economic reform programme , said he differed with the Confederation of Indian Industry ( CII ) , which said in a background paper prepared for the conference that India &apos;s current account deficit was high . 
the current account deficit for 1996 / 97 ( April-March ) is currently estimated at 1.4 percent of the GDP , as against 1.7 percent in 1995 / 96 . 
it represents the gap between imports and exports of merchandise as well as services . 
India &apos;s gross domestic savings rate averaged 23.9 of the GDP between 1992 and 1996 , and gross domestic investment 25.3 , indicating an average current account deficit of 1.4 percent . 
Chidambaram said India needed to boost both savings and investment to sustain a growth rate of 8.0 percent . 
India &apos;s GDP is estimated to have grown 6.8 percent in 1996 / 97 , compared with 7.1 percent in 1995 / 96 . 
India must boldly free up imports , allow more foreign borrowings by Indian firms and invest in education , healthcare and environment to sustain high growth , he said .
