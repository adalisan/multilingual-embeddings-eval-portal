the wife of the leader of a group of armed Republic of Texas separatists planned to leave the compound in the Texas mountains on Saturday , a police spokeswoman said . 
Evelyn McLaren has been holed up with her husband , Richard McLaren , and other members of the group for six days , refusing pleas from police to surrender to face felony charges . 
the Republic members claim Texas is an independent nation and that they form its provisional government . 
&quot; She &apos;s indicated she would like to come out of the enclave , &quot; police spokeswoman , Laureen Churnow , said of Evelyn McLaren . 
Mrs. McLaren decided to leave after repeated pleas from her daughter over the past three days to come out . 
the tearful pleas were broadcast by television and radio . 
her departure would leave six separatists holed up at the group &apos;s dilapidated compound in the Davis Mountains . 
the group remains surrounded by police who overnight moved to within 440 yards of the compound .
