European stocks are reaching valuation levels that will leave many players feeling uncomfortable and investors could soon be looking to lock in some of 1996 &apos;s steep gains , ING Barings said . 
&quot; We are not far from the point where it would be prudent to lock in some of Europe &apos;s heady gains , &quot; a research report dated March 12 said . 
it said 1996 &apos;s strong run had continued in most markets in 1997 , with all but two of the continental bourses coming close to all-time highs . 
the push towards EMU and resultant tight fiscal policy and monetary relaxation had provided a strong case for exposure to mainland European equities , as well as the weaker mark . 
also , nominal bond yields had fallen to levels where further reductions in long rates would prove difficult . 
&quot; Against this background it is worth revisiting the scope for further upside potential on stock markets . 
it said the macroeconomic environment continued to be market-friendly in the near term , and this could help keep the market on track . 
but later in the year much depended on further progress in corporate restructuring to maintain momentum in equities . 
&quot; The extent to which continental European markets can retain their allure later in the year will depend critically on expectations of re-ratings , which are based on microeconomic reform and the release of shareholder value being sustained , &quot; it said .
