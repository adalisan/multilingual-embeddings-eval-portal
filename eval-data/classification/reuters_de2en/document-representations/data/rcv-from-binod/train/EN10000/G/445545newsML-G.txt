Nightlong celebrations stretched well into Sunday in rebel-held eastern Zaire after the fall of Kisangani , Zaire &apos;s third largest city and site of a big army garrison . 
in poor districts of the eastern border town of Goma , the rebel headquarters , frenzied traditional drumming boomed out on Saturday evening as news spread of the greatest success to date of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire ( AFDL ) . 
&quot; Only now do we really feel we are safe . 
we know that the Alliance is winning and we know there is no way the army will return to Goma , &quot; said businessman Moise Katembo . 
after five months of civil war , the fall of Kisangani is the biggest blow so far to ailing president Mobutu Sese Seko -- who for years had ruled the vast nation at the heart of Africa with an iron grip . 
Kisangani residents said by telephone rebels swept almost unopposed into the city centre on Saturday after terrified Zairean soldiers looted what they could and fled west across the Zaire River . 
Goma , one of the first towns to fall , has been under rebel control since November , becoming the seat of veteran guerrilla leader Laurent Kabila and his parallel administration . 
fear of a threatened government counter-offensive by Mobutu &apos;s army has dogged Goma &apos;s inhabitants since jets , based in Kisangani , bombed the town of Bukavu , 150 km ( 95 miles ) to the south in February . 
&quot; At least this can give us some confidence to invest , to do business and to live our lives without fear . 
we have waited for this for 30 years , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; Now we have to hope that the new leaders will not take on the ways of the old . 
despite vast potential mineral riches , Zaire is one of the world &apos;s poorest countries with corruption and mismanagement eating away at all levels of society . 
the rebellion , launched in October by ethnic Tutsis threatened with expulsion to neighbouring Rwanda , broadened its popular base as the rebel fighters overran at least a fifth of the country . 
the Zaire army , backed by foreign mercenaries and Hutus of the former Rwandan army accused of genocide at home , has been steadily rolled back 500 km ( 300 miles ) through the jungle from Goma . 
&quot; Kisangani was the symbol of the threatened counter-offensive , the stronghold of the army . 
we wanted to demystify the idea that mercenaries were strong and could defend it , &quot; Kabila told a news conference on Saturday . 
amid a fug of sweat , beer fumes and loud Zairean music , Goma &apos;s top nightclub was packed on Saturday night despite imposing special entry fees . 
in a town deep in poverty , civil servants are not paid and trade has been squashed by the war . 
despite the chaos and the collapse of most normal trade , the supply of beer has continued from the local brewery . 
&quot; I just had to come out to celebrate the fall of Kisangani , there was no choice , &quot; said Mariam Kambale , who had paid the five dollar entry fee to the Coco Jambo -- even though it meant she couldn &apos;t afford to buy a drink .
