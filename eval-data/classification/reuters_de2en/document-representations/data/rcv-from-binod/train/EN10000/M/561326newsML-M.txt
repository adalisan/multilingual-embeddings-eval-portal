Shenzhen &apos;s hard currency B share index advanced during the morning session on Monday , boosted by a sharp rise in Shanghai &apos;s B share market , brokers said . 
Shanghai &apos;s B share index soared 5.690 points or 6.24 percent to 96.909 by noon with investors scrambling to buy blue chips and Pudong real estate related shares , brokers said . 
analysts said they expect Shenzhen B shares to extend gains during the afternoon session due to good sentiment . 
Shenzhen &apos;s A share index climbed 15.01 points or 3.07 percent to 504.23 on heavy turnover of 8.32 billion yuan . 
the China Securities Regulatory Commission , the country &apos;s top securities watchdog , on Monday announced a new five billion yuan quota , in addition to the existing 10 billion yuan , for new share issues in 1997 or later . 
analysts said they viewed the announcement as a move to cool down China &apos;s stock markets , since new issues would absorb funds . 
&quot; But A shares firmed as investors have digested the news , &quot; a second analyst said . 
however , analysts warned that an overly speculative market and continuous rises could trigger more government measures to cool the markets . 
brokers said the surge was sparked by hopes that the firm &apos;s new shareholder would drag Tellus into the black in 1997 after the company posted a net loss of 187.55 million yuan for 1996 . 
Tellus announced last Wednesday that state firm Shenzhen Special Economic Zone Development ( Group ) Co had bought 159.59 million state shares , accounting for 72.4 percent of Tellus &apos;s outstanding shares , from local government-backed Shenzhen Investment &amp; Management Co .
