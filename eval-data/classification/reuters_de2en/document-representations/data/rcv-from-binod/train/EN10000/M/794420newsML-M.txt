the AEX , made up of 25 blue chip shares , gained 5.33 points at 978.40 , but this closing level was well below an intraday high of 985.45 reached on an early wave of retail buy orders . 
Paper-maker KNP BT , tipped by many analysts to outperform after lagging other cyclicals so far this year , gained 2.00 guilders or 4.1 percent at 50.30 . 
publisher Elsevier rose 1.10 guilders or 3.3 PCT to 33.90 in a partial recovery from steep losses after last week &apos;s results .
