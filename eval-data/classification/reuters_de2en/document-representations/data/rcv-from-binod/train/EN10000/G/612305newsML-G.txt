Mexico &apos;s President Ernesto Zedillo has lashed out at the opposition parties running in the mid-term elections in July , attacking their publicity as an attempt to fool the public . 
&quot; We have to draw your attention to those who do not do much because they hate capitalism , but who are now using the techniques of capitalism to try to fool the people , &quot; Zedillo said in a speech Friday in the southern city of Villahermosa . 
&quot; They are using publicity like people trying to sell potato chips , beer and soda pop to tell people that like this they can resolve their problems , &quot; Zedillo said , according to a report in the Reforma newspaper Saturday . 
all three parties , and some smaller ones , have flooded television and radio with hard-hitting advertisements . 
Mexicans will vote for a new lower house in Congress , as well as part of the Senate , governors in six states and the mayor of Mexico City .
