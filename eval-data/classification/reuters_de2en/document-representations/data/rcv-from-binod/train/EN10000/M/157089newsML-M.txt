U.S. Plains feedlot cattle trade was slow early Thursday , with light sales at $ 71.00 per cwt , steady with this week , feedlot sources said . 
between 100 and 200 head sold at $ 71.00 in Kansas as feedlots continued to clean up their showlists for this week , the sources said . 
Showlists in Kansas and the Texas Panhandle / western Oklahoma area were mostly depleted . 
a few feedlots in Kansas later Thursday may put together new showlists , which could result in $ 72.00 trades if the cattle are well-fed enough and packers want them , a Kansas feedlot operator said . 
demand for cattle this week has been supported by ongoing tight supplies of market-ready cattle . 
owners were pulling cattle as much as three weeks ahead of expected markeing dates to meet packer demand , feedlot sources said . 
fed cattle prices also were buoyed by consistent moderate beef demand , which has also lifted boxed beef values . 
beef prices Wednesday were quoted up $ 0.28 to $ 0.51 per cwt , on 186 loads sold , USDA said . 
heavyweight choice beef prices sold $ 0.51 at $ 106.10 . 
cattle sales for the week-to-date Wednesday were 73,700 head in the Panhandle and 60,400 in Kansas , USDA said .
