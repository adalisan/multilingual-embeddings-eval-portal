U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on Sunday the United States has no intention of cutting back its forces in Japan or Asia despite some calls for closure of American bases in Okinawa . 
Albright , who arrived in Tokyo from Seoul as part of a nine-nation tour , her first overseas visit since taking office last month , urged Japan to end uncertainty about the future of bases on Okinawa . 
in the first meeting between a Japanese defence minister and a U.S. secretary of state for 14 years , Albright told Defence Minister Fumio Kyuma that Washington wanted to maintain its current force levels in Japan , Japanese officials said . 
her visit coincides with leadership turmoil in North Korea , the unpredictable Stalinist state which is one of the main strategic reasons for a large American military presence in Japan , particularly on the small southern island of Okinawa . 
some Okinawa residents have started a campaign to shut the bases because of worries about the impact U.S. servicemen have on the local community . 
&quot; The Secretary said in all three meetings with Japanese ministers that the U.S. fully intended to maintain the 100,000 troops in the Asia-Pacific region , &quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters in Tokyo . 
&quot; And we expect to maintain the current force levels in Japan , &quot; Burns said . 
the future of the U.S. bases on Okinawa has been threatened , just as tensions rise on the Korean peninsula , by the refusal of about 3,000 landowners to approve an extension of leases , which run out in mid-May , for land occupied by the installations . 
Albright told Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda that , while she understood the sensitivity of the Okinawa issue , it was equally important to maintain firm U.S.-Japan security ties . 
Albright said the security links were &quot; an important basis of the whole relationship between the two countries . 
about 49,000 U.S. military personnel are based in Japan , more than half of them on sub-tropical Okinawa , 1,600 km ( 1,000 miles ) southwest of Tokyo . 
Okinawa hosts more than 75 percent of all U.S. military bases and Okinawans have long complained of noise , accidents and crime in areas near the sprawling military facilities . 
the island is in easy striking range of North Korea , Taiwan and China . 
facing calls to cut back U.S. bases , Tokyo and Washington argue a strong U.S. presence on strategically-located Okinawa is needed to maintain stability in a potentially volatile region . 
public outrage about the bases has grown since the September 1996 rape of an Okinawa schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen who are now serving up to 10 years each in jail for the crime . 
in her meetings , Albright signalled that the State Department under her planned a more active role in ensuring foreign policy was taken into account when deciding trade issues . 
Albright urged Trade Minister Shinji Sato , as well as Ikeda , to implement trade agreements concluded between the two nations . 
she said the U.S. government would closely watch whether Japan kept a commitment to open its market , particularly a recent agreement over car parts . 
other clouds on the trade horizon are over photographic film , shipping and telecommunications . 
burns said that although Albright did not plan a negotiating role on trade , she wanted Japan and other nations to be aware that trade discussions were an important part of foreign policy . 
Albright meets Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Monday before she leaves Tokyo for Beijing , the last stop on her tour .
