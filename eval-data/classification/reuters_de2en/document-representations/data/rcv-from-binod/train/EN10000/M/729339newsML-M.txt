CBOT soybean futures ended mixed on Tuesday with new crop months up on forecasts for a week of hot , dry weather that could lead to crop damage , traders said . 
&quot; There was support to new crop beans on weather and old crop was quiet because of a lack of exports , &quot; said Jerry Gidel , analyst for Dean Witter . 
forecasters expect a heat wave for the U.S. Midwest through Friday with high temperatures from the low to high 90 degrees Fahrenheit area . 
no rainfall was seen until Friday . 
new crop months had crumbled in overnight Project A trade after showers moved across Iowa , Illinois and Indiana Monday afternoon but meteorologists said the heaviest rainfall missed some dry pockets in central Illinois and eastern Iowa . 
persistent hot , dry weather can damage developing crops . 
soybeans ended up four cents a bushel to down eight with November up four at $ 6.25-3 / 4 . 
traders said the market ignored bearish longer-term outlooks issued by the National weather Service on Monday . 
the NWS six- to 10-day outlook called for above normal rainfall and normal to below normal temperatures for much of the Midwest July 20-24 . 
traders also pointed to reports of dry weather in northern China which could cut soybean yields . 
the dry pattern and flooding in southern China have both been linked to the El Nino weather pattern . 
Nearbys ended lower on a spread alignment and on sentiment that demand for old crop had subsided . 
&quot; In old crop , there was a little bit of a lull in the demand story from China and others , &quot; Dean Witter &apos;s Gidel said . 
traders also noted the July / November spread had widened to more than $ 1.90 a bushel , premium July , on Monday and was due for a setback . 
cash sources pointed to weakness in U.S. Gulf CIF values and in soybean processor bids as another cause for lower old crop prices . 
&quot; We rallied last week because we had priced ourselves back into contention ( export ) on the old crop , &quot; a veteran CBOT trader said . 
&quot; Now were tracking back down because we attracted too much attention . 
next we &apos;ll probably price ourselves back into contention once again . 
on the day , funds bought at least 15 million bushels . 
Refco Inc bought seven million November and 1.5 million August and FIMAT futures and Merrill Lynch each bought two million November , pit sources said . 
in options trade , Lind-Waldock bought 1,000 November $ 8.00 calls at six to 7-1 / 2 cents and FIMAT sold 500 November $ 7.00 calls at 14 cents . 
soybean futures volume was estimated by CBOT at 60,000 contracts , compared with Monday &apos;s actual volume of 65,477 .
