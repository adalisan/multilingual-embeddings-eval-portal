Chilean blue chips on Thursday rallied to close nearly one percent higher on buy orders from cash-rich pension funds , traders said . 
that may have set the stage for a wave of profit-taking at the opening on Friday , they added . 
&quot; The market could be hit by a technical adjustment at the opening , but the underlying trend is upward , &quot; said one dealer . 
volume held fairly steady at 10.4 billion pesos . 
although turnover remained light , traders said investors were more optmistic amid signs that the pension funds -- the largest institutional investors in Chile -- were starting to return to the stock market after months on the sidelines . 
the funds , which control $ 27 billion , have around 28 percent of their portfolios in stocks , lower than their usual level of 31 percent , said dealers . 
high domestic interest rates have resulted in investors switching funds from the Bolsa to fixed-income instruments . 
leading gainers included Banco O &apos;Higgins , which rose amid expectations the bank will benefit most from a debt deal between the Chilean central bank and Banco de Santiago . 
the agreement clears the way for a merger between the two private banks , said traders . 
Santiago &apos;s shareholders are seen losing out under the pact . 
fertilizer maker Soquimich and supermarket chain Santa Isabel rose amid speculation the companies will report solid third-quarter earnings , traders said .
