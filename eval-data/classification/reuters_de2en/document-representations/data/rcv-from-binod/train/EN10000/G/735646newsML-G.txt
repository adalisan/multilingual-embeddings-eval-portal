Marxist guerrillas in Mexico have ended a temporary truce , but nonetheless welcomed the ruling party &apos;s historic losses in recent mid-term elections , newspapers said on Thursday . 
the Popular Revolutionary Army ( EPR ) said in a statement that it had reactivated its &quot; tactic of armed revolutionary self-defence &quot; in the early hours of Wednesday , the national daily La Jornada said . 
the EPR had ordered its fighters not to launch any fresh attacks following two bloody clashes with the army at the end of June , but it rejected calls from church leaders to lay down their arms ahead of national elections on July 6 . 
Mexican voters dealt the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( pri ) its worst defeat in seven decades during the election -- which cost it a majority in the lower house of Congress and control of the capital city . 
the election was seen as the cleanest ever under the pri . 
&quot; ( The election results show ) the advance of the democratic revolutionary struggle and the general rejection by the people of bad government which ... has been responsible for the constant wrongs done to all the people of the nation , &quot; the EPR said . 
but rebels said their struggle would continue if conditions for Mexico &apos;s impoverished majority did not improve . 
&quot; If conditions of misery , repression , militarization , the lack of recognition of Indian rights , unemployment and the submission of the country to the requirements of national and international capital continue , then distinct forms of struggle will keep developing , like those that already exist in order to achieve true democracy in the country , &quot; the statement said . 
the guerrilla group first appeared in June 1996 calling for the overthrow of President Ernesto Zedillo . 
more than 30 people have been killed and 50 wounded in clashes between the rebels and the army since then .
