an Algerian court on Sunday sentenced eight managers in a state-owned enterprise to up to 15 years in jail for embezzling state assets , said the official Algerian news agency APS . 
the eight from the food distribution Edipal firm were among a total of 47 people standing trial for their role in a 440 million dinars ( $ 7.8 million ) scandal . 
the court in Djelfa , 230 km ( 130 miles ) south of Algiers , condemned the eight to between three and 15 years &apos; jail after they were convicted for &quot; misappropriating state assets and signing deals without respect of the legislation &quot; , APS said . 
the tribunal also sentenced an unspecified number of accused to seven years &apos; imprisonment after the nine-day trial attended by 25 lawyers , it added . 
the court condemned 22 people , who are at large , to death in absentia for the same charges . 
the sentences were the harshest imposed since early in 1996 when Algerian authorities began issuing a stream of statements on arrests and jail sentences on senior officials in state-run business in a crackdown on graft . 
the government vowed to wipe out corruption since President Liamine Zeroual put anti-graft high in his agenda in an attempt to bridge the gap of mistrust between ordinary Algerians and their leaders .
