the White House released documents Wednesday that it said proved President Clinton &apos;s insistence that the collection of confidential FBI reports on Republicans was simply a bureaucratic blunder . 
but a Senate investigator said other documents continued to raise questions about the improper White House acquisition of hundreds of FBI files on former Republican officials , although nefarious purposes had not been proven . 
White House officials said the documents showed White House security aide Anthony Marceca was working from inaccurate lists produced by the Secret Service when he obtained the FBI secret background files . 
a White House associate counsel , Mark Fabiani , released a thick stack of papers that he said constituted the faulty Secret Service lists Marceca was using . 
he said the White House would have released them sooner but they had been in the custody of Kenneth Starr , the independent counsel investigating cases involving Clinton and his wife , Hillary . 
&quot; These newly revealed Secret Service lists support what the White House has said all along about the FBI files matter : the files were mistakenly sought as the result of a bureaucratic blunder , &quot; Fabiani said . 
Republicans have suggested that in collecting the files on Republicans , the White House was compiling an &quot; enemies list &quot; and committed an extreme violation of privacy . 
at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the so-called &quot; filegate &quot; affair Wednesday , Chairman Orrin Hatch , a Utah Republican , called the White House release of documents &quot; irrelevant &quot; because Marceca knew at the time that officials of prior administrations were included in the file requests , as shown by other documents . 
hatch said a log in which Marceca &apos;s office recorded the receipt of FBI files contained unexplained gaps and the committee had discovered pages had been deliberately removed . 
he cited a memo from Marceca &apos;s former boss at the personnel security office , Craig Livingstone , to former White House associate counsel William Kennedy , saying : &quot; Once the initial rush subsides we will begin to request copies of files from the FBI on carryovers . 
this will be our first glance at the background information of their employees . 
Livingstone testified to the committee that the memo merely dealt with White House employees who were being retained by the Clinton administration . 
he said he had no recollection of removing pages from the log or asking anyone else to do so and he believed a six-month gap in the log was due merely to the fact that it had not been kept up to date . 
the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee adopted an interim report on the FBI files case Tuesday and called for FBI General counsel Howard Shapiro to resign . 
it accused the White House of trying to politicize the bureau . 
in prepared testimony to the Judiciary Committee , Shapiro said he regretted that contacts he had with the White House in the file affair had raised questions about the FBI &apos;s independence and in hindsight would do things differently . 
the records released by the White House had been part of two boxes of documents the White House turned over to the FBI in June and the FBI turned them over to Starr &apos;s office . 
when Starr was asked to return them , the White House was told they would be sent back when disclosure &quot; would not hinder or impede our investigation . 
&quot; Deputy independent counsel John Bates returned the lists Tuesday , saying in a letter that &quot; we believe that time has been reached . 
Fabiani said the release of the lists undermined the Republicans &apos; argument by proving the Secret Service produced them in June 1993 -- months after Clinton took office . 
this would mean the Secret Service was mistakenly giving the White House names of people who no longer worked there , he said .
