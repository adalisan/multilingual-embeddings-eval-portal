U.S. mediator Dennis Ross , who has failed to achieve a long-delayed Israeli-Palestinian agreement on Hebron , will continue his Mideast mission on a &quot; day to day &quot; basis , the State Department said on Friday . 
after a meeting earlier in the day between Ross and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat , spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters : &quot; There still is no deal between the Palestinians and the Israelis . 
burns , at a news briefing , rejected suggestions the Palestinians were to blame for the failure this week to conclude the Hebron deal . 
&quot; Dennis is taking his sojourn out there on a day-to-day basis . 
he &apos;s going to have to assess on a day-to-day basis how useful it is for him to be there , &quot; Burns said after a telephone conversation with Ross . 
the two sides have &quot; made some progress over the last week or so but not sufficient progress to complete an agreement on the redeployment of the Israeli Defence Forces from Hebron ... there still is no deal between the Palestinians and the Israelis , &quot; Burns said . 
he said Ross would meet Arafat again on Saturday . 
&quot; It &apos;s been very useful this week but we need to see the Israelis and Palestinians together cross this finish line . 
the United States cannot do that for them , &quot; he added . 
there has been some speculation in the press that Arafat &apos;s stance might have been toughened by Wednesday &apos;s shooting incident in Hebron , in which an Israeli soldier with a history of mental illness opened fire on Arabs in a crowded market with the intention of scuttling the Hebron deal . 
seven Arabs were wounded . 
but Burns , asked about suggestions the Palestinians were digging in their heels , said : &quot; I don &apos;t agree with it ... 
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s accurate based on my knowledge of these negotiations . 
&quot; And it takes two to tango , and both are responsible . 
so we &apos;re not pointing the finger at the Palestinians or at the Israelis and saying that one or the other has more responsibility than the other to make an agreement , &quot; he said . 
burns refused to say , however , whether Palestinians had changed any of their positions after Wednesday &apos;s shooting . 
he again praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Arafat for handling the incident in a responsible , non-inflammatory way . 
at the beginning of the week , there were predictions by leaders on both sides that Netanyahu and Arafat would meet imminently to conclude the Hebron deal . 
but such talk has evaporated . 
burns said &quot; this is the endgame &quot; of a difficult negotiation with political and religious import and hence such negotiations &quot; often -- and in this case certainly have -- become much more difficult and much more intensive .
