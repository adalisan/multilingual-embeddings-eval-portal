( from the &quot; Inside Canberra &quot; newsletter ) 
Queensland premier Rob Borbidge &apos;s latest insult to Prime Minister John Howard is all about the terror in the Queensland National Party of the Pauline Hanson bandwagon . 
stating Howard &apos;s 10-point Wik plan would &quot; stuff the bush &quot; , Borbidge called for explicit extinguishment of native title . 
he knows full well Howard cannot go down this track as it would be more certain than ever that such legislation would be rejected by the High Court . 
Borbidge is getting in early with a &quot; don &apos;t blame me &quot; approach should the fallout in the bush be damaging when the full Howard plan is revealed . 
the latest Newspoll , taken after the launch of Pauline Hanson &apos;s One Nation Party , showed in Queensland the party was polling the same as the Democrats -- four percent . 
but it will not be the Australian Democrats who suffer should One Nation gain a Senate seat , but rather the National Party which could see Senator Bill O &apos;Chee lose his seat . 
Hanson has been easily pulling far larger crowds than O &apos;Chee in appearances throughout Queensland . 
Hanson &apos;s anti-Aboriginal , anti-Asian platform appeals far more to the natural National Party supporter than the supporter of the Democrats . 
four percent is an impressive result for Hanson . 
but her party is unlikely to win a seat in the Senate unless she stands herself by resigning from her formerly safe Labor seat of Oxley . 
the strength of her party is the incredible visibility she has achieved in the comparatively short time she has been in parliament -- just over a year . 
but this is also the weakness of her party -- it is a one-woman outfit . 
if she stands for the Senate she will almost certainly win in a double dissolution election because of the much lower quota -- 7.7 per cent after distribution of preference votes -- and she will have a good chance in a normal half Senate election even though the quota -- 14.3 per cent -- is much higher .
