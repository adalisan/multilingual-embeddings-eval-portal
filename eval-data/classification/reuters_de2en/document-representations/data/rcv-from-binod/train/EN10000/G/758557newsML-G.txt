Melbourne , July 28 - The difficult part of the rugby test season yielded better results for the All Blacks than they had anticipated , but coach John Hart was still wary of the fact that the Tri-Series could still be lost , NZPA reports . 
Saturday night &apos;s 33-18 win over the Wallabies at the Melbourne Cricket Ground meant the All Blacks have retained the Bledisloe Cup 2-0 in the best-of-three tests , with one match remaining . 
they have also tightened their grip on the Tri-Series with two wins from two . 
the All Blacks &apos; return matches are at home , against South Africa at Eden Park in two weeks and Australia at Carisbrook a week later . 
hart warned his players that they were yet to retain the series they won last season . 
&quot; Anyone who thinks we &apos;ve won it is making a serious mistake , &quot; Hart said as his players looked forward to a week &apos;s break before re-assembling in Auckland next Tuesday to prepare for the Springboks . 
hart will name the team for that test on Wednesday with no expected changes . 
&quot; I rated this part of the season as the hardest the All Blacks and have faced and I said that before we went to South Africa , &quot; Hart said . 
despite the travelling , a tough and physical match against South Africa in difficult conditions at Johannesburg and the clash against Australia six days later , the All Blacks emerged with nine out of a possible 10 points in the series . 
it included a bonus point for scoring four tries or more in a match . 
&quot; We wanted one win away at least . 
Australia and South Africa meet in Brisbane on Saturday . 
but the South Africans will do all their buildup work for Auckland in Brisbane then travel to New Zealand on the Thursday before the game . 
a win for the All Blacks at Eden Park will reduce the Wallabies-Springboks clash in Pretoria later as a mere formality . 
hart had a special mention for 22-year-olds , Taine Randell , for his defence work , and Carlos Spencer , for his goalkicking efforts with seven from seven . 
veteran centre Frank Bunce also got a mention for his all-round game and organisational skills in midfield during the Melbourne test . 
&quot; It &apos;s hard to pick individuals in a game like that because the whole team supported each other in defence when the pressure was on , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Our defence against South Africa last week was our weakness and I was critical of it but it was outstanding here . 
from a 3-3 tie , the All Blacks scored two tries in two minutes and rocketed ahead 17-3 . 
the first touch-down was set up by Randell and scored by Bunce and the second , a spectacular piece of action , was created by halfback Justin Marshall and superbly executed by winger Jeff Wilson . 
an illustration why the All Blacks are the most feared side in the world came in the second half . 
their magnificent defence , which included the Brooke brothers Zinzan and Robin , Randell , Josh Kronfeld , Ian Jones , Sean Fitzpatrick , Olo Brown and Craig Dowd , Marshall , Alama Ieremia and Bunce held a relentless 20-minute attack from the Wallabies . 
when the ball was finally played in the Australian 22 , Fitzpatrick and Brown provided the spade work and Spencer the finesse , to get fullback Christian Cullen over the Wallaby try line . 
at 30-6 the Wallabies plan to opt for lineouts and scrums from penalties instead of goalkicks backfired . 
I think they could have got nine points because it was still early in the second half , &quot; Fitzpatrick said . 
but they did get some respectability with two tries , by halfback George Gregan and centre Jason Little . 
Wallaby coach Greg Smith lamented poor ball retention and errors by his team . 
he lampooned No 8 Michael Brial in particular for a missed tackle on Randell and a turnover to Kronfeld which resulted in tries by Bunce and Wilson . 
&quot; No one told him to go out and do that , &quot; said an extremely disappointed Smith . 
&quot; When you &apos;re playing a good team they &apos;ll exploit that . 
they ( the All Blacks ) were certainly too good for us in the first half but as I see it , it was the result of a person making two mistakes . 
Brial was replaced by Troy Coker well before halftime . 
it was his first test this season . 
&quot; While we fixed up certain areas of our game -- the scrum &apos;s one of them -- it just shows that you have to be solid right across the board when you play a team like the All Blacks , &quot; said Wallaby captain John Eales . 
TIM Horan , switched to first five-eighth this season from his familiar midfield role , broke his hand early in the game but played through the first half .
