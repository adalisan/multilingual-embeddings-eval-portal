the Reserve Bank of Australia board holds its first meeting of 1997 on Tuesday , February 4 . 
ahead of the meeting , Reuters asked 30 economists the following questions 
1 ) What is the percentage chance of the RBA delivering a rate cut at any stage in February ? 
2 ) If there has not been a cut by the end of February , what is the chance there will still be a cut in rates ? 
the median forecast was for a 40 percent chance of a rate cut during February , with the odds on a cut rising to 50 percent if it hasn &apos;t been delivered by the end of February . 
the reason for the increased chance after February is that not only will the union movement &apos;s &quot; living wage &quot; claim outcome be known , but the RBA will also have had more opportunity to assess the impact of the November and December rate cuts . 
those who saw a greater chance of a cut in February said that after the positive December quarter inflation data , and with wages likely to remain in the RBA &apos;s comfort zone , the window of opportunity was there for an easing , but would be starting to close at the end of the first quarter . 
however , some economists argued that the new round of fiscal tightening annouced by the Treasurer would mean that sentiment may be adversely affected , keeping activity depressed and extending the opening for a rate cut into the second quarter . 
some of those favouring a February easing were also assuming the U.S. Fed would not lift interest rates next week .
