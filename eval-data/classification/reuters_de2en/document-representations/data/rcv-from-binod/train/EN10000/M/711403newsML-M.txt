aggressive combining of the U.S. winter wheat crop and persistent reports of excellent yields drove KCBT hard red winter wheat futures to new three-year lows and contract lows at midsession , traders said . 
&quot; They &apos;ve found so much wheat that they will feed some and with corn going down too , wheat can &apos;t hold up , &quot; a trader said . 
selling was broad based and included commercial hedge selling after a weekend of nearly ideal harvest conditions , the traders said . 
the new low for July was $ 3.20-1 / 2 per bushel , below the previous low of $ 3.25 set Thursday . 
the $ 3.20-1 / 2 level also is the lowest price for a nearby KCBT wheat contract since June 1994 , just over three years ago . 
at 1030 CDT , KCBT hard red winter wheat futures were four to five cents per bushel lower , with July down four at $ 3.21 .
