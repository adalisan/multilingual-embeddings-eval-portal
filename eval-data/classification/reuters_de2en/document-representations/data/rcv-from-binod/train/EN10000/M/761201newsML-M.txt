with key support at 137.73 eroded early on Monday , September BTP futures on LIFFE can head lower to Friday &apos;s low of 137.48 and towards 137.30 , technical analysts said . 
but Martin Scott of MCM YieldWatch said that given Friday &apos;s firmer close , the market still had a mild upside bias . 
September BTPs could try to clear 138.25 resistance initially , then start a fresh assault on the contract high of 138.44 , Scott said . 
&quot; 138.25 is a pivotal area , &quot; he said , adding this level was a trendline drawn from 138.44 through to 138.35 on Thursday . 
by 0750 , September was down 0.27 at 137.71 . 
the early slide on Monday took out key support at 137.73 , which is a trendline drawn from Friday &apos;s lows . 
BTPs resumed a steep uptrend last week after a brief consolidation pattern that initially gave the impression of a top formation . 
but since hitting 138.44 on July 23 the contract edged down , reaching lower highs each day . 
technical analysts at Chase said in a research note that provided the BTP remained above 137.62 , it would resume the uptrend , putting the initial 138.10 resistance under pressure . 
in this case it would develop a move down to find support at 136.90 and trend line support at 136.75 . 
a break above 138.10 however would take the BTP contract to the 138.44 high , but once above there it would test the upper boundary of the ascending trend channel intervening at 138.95 on intraday charts from where it might scale back , Chase analysts said . 
the nine-week RSI was developing above a major channel support suggesting more medium term strength . 
at the short end of the curve , September Eurolira stood down 0.05 at 93.26 .
