* Australian 10-year bond futures trawled a narrow range during SYCOM trade , largely mirroring U.S. treasuries , and after Wednesday &apos;s sell-off paused . 
* April U.S. durable goods orders were close to forecasts , although March revised up , but 2-year note sale sluggish . 
the June Australian 10-year bond futures contract trawled a narrow range during after hours trade , largely mirroring U.S. treasuries , and after Wednesday &apos;s sell-off paused . 
the contract ended SYCOM at 92.370 , little changed from Wednesday &apos;s 92.375 pit close , although support once again held at 92.350 , analysts noted . 
the market is finding runs to the upside heavy going with resistance holding around the mid-92.400s , preventing a retest of last Friday &apos;s 12-week high of 92.500 which was briefly struck after the unexpected rate cut . 
U.S. treasuries succumbed to a choppy session , finding some support from the April U.S. durable goods orders which came in close to expectations , rising 1.4 percent , although the March data was also revised up to a 2.2 percent negative . 
however , the result of the two-year note sale was described as mediocre and saw the market slip back from the highs . 
the local market sees first quarter business inventories and the April balance of goods and services at 11.30 a.m. ( 0030 GMT ) , but this week &apos;s key data will be Friday &apos;s release of April retail trade for an indication of current activity .
