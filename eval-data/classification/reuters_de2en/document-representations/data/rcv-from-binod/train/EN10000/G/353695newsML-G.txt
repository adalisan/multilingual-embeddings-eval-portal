Serbia &apos;s authoritarian President Slobodan Milosevic has caved in to relentless opposition pressure for democratic change , prompting a cautious welcome from foreign and domestic critics alike . 
Milosevic , an austere , autocratic figure , said on Tuesday he had written to his prime minister asking parliament to reinstate the disputed results of November &apos;s local elections . 
Washington said it welcomed the move &quot; as a first step in the right direction in Serbia &quot; , while Milosevic &apos;s domestic foes vowed to keep up protests until all demands were met . 
Milosevic acted two days after ordering his feared paramilitary police to break up demonstrations , leaving scores of people injured in the worst violence seen in Belgrade for several years . 
his political opponents , united in a three-party coalition , want their local election victories in 14 cities and towns , including Belgrade , reinstated . 
they demand free media , and the prosecution of those responsible for police violence . 
&quot; In keeping with its constitutional competence , I propose that the Serbian government submit to parliament a draft emergency law which will proclaim as final results of a part of local elections in Serbia in keeping with the findings of the OSCE ( factfinding ) mission , &quot; Milosevic said in his letter to the prime minister . 
the &quot; part &quot; referred to those results annulled by the socialist authorities . 
the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe had verified the opposition claim to election wins . 
within hours , Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic told state radio and television that a draft law reinstating the disputed results would probably be submitted to parliament on Wednesday . 
diplomats said Milosevic &apos;s capitulation to the Serbian pro-democracy movement was not a complete surprise . 
the question was why it took 77 days of street demonstrations . 
authoritative political sources said he was using that time preparing for a showdown with hardliners in his party . 
&quot; Milosevic &apos;s concession is more a result of the moderates prevailing over the hardliners ( in the SPS ) , &quot; one source said . 
opposition co-leader Zoran Djindjic , wary of possible Socialist subterfuge , said protests would not end yet . 
&quot; We will continue them until all ( municipal ) councillor mandates are verified , until freedom of the media is established , and until responsibility is established of all those who took part in the vote theft and brutal beating up of ctizens , &quot; he told 80,000 cheering demonstrators . 
the European Union expressed its pleasure at Milosevic &apos;s sudden decision , while German Chancellor Helmut Kohl held out hope that the republics of former Yugoslavia could become members of the European Union early in the next century . 
an economic think-tank in Belgrade , the Institute of Economic Sciences , said Serbia &apos;s policymakers faced a tough choice of radical reforms or remaining passive and letting the entire system collapse . 
the official Yugoslav news agency reported that Milosevic , meeting trade union leaders on Tuesday , said structural changes that would speed development , increase personal income and employment &quot; were in the best interests of the workers &quot; . 
the sole incident that marred Tuesday &apos;s breakthrough in the crisis occurred in downtown Belgrade after dark when witnesses saw young toughs attack a French embassy car and manhandle the unidentified driver . 
warning shots were fired and a local radio station said the action helped save the driver from serious injury .
