Denmark &apos;s Wilson Kipketer broke the oldest world record in athletics on Wednesday when he smashed SEB CoE &apos;s 16-year-old mark for the men &apos;s 800 metres as three world marks tumbled on the night . 
a warm , still evening at the Zurich grand Prix also saw Wilson Boit Kipketer set a new mark of seven minutes 59.08 seconds for the 3,000 steeplechase and Ethiopia &apos;s Haile Gebrselassie destroy his own world record for the 5,000 metres with a time of 12 : 41.86 . 
after no world records fell at the world championships in Athens , the richest meeting in athletics witnessed one of the most remarkable middle-distance performances of all time from Kenyan-born Kipketer . 
he took nearly half a second off CoE &apos;s time by clocking one minute 41.24 seconds . 
the world champion was just a youngster growing up in Kenya when CoE sped around a track in the Italian city of Florence to set the previous best of 1 : 41.73 in June 1981 . 
Kipketer , who equalled CoE &apos;s record in Stockholm earlier in the season , made the two-lap race look almost like a sprint as he was helped through the first 400 metres in an astonishing 48.10 by compatriot Joseph Tengelei -- compared to CoE &apos;s 49.7 . 
twice last season , Kipketer , who went to live in Denmark in 1990 , went close to the world record after missing the Atlanta Olympics because he was not cleared to run for his adopted country . 
he was roared through the last 400 metres by an ecstatic crowd who could hardly believe their eyes a few minutes later when Gebrselassie won a facinating 5,000 battle with Kenyan world champion Daniel komen to shave more than two seconds off his previous best of 12 : 44.39 set on the same track two years ago . 
&quot; The weather was fantastic . 
Wilson Boit Kipketer , who is not related to the 800 runner , won a dramatic battle with compatriots Moses Kiptanui and Bernard Barmasai to win his first world steeplechase title last week . 
the same two runners pulled him along to a fast last lap and a world record of seven minutes 59.08 seconds on Wednesday , shaving one-tenth of a second from the previous best of 7 : 59.18 set by Kiptanui on the same Zurich track in August 1995 . 
Kiptanui , who had to settle for second place behind Kipketer at this month &apos;s world championships in Athens , finished third in 8 : 00.78 behind second-placed Barmasai who ran 8 : 00.35 . 
all three record-breaking athletes earned a world record bonus of $ 50,000 plus one kilo of gold . 
with appearance fees they were each guaranteed at least $ 100,000 from their efforts . 
&quot; When so many Kenyans start together in a race in this stadium , the only possibility is to expect a world record , &quot; Kiptanui said . 
&quot; To me , it is a motivation and I would like to try at least once more but it &apos;s getting harder and harder . 
Wilson Boit Kipketer , who has been working hard on finishing his races strongly with specific training , added : &quot; I didn &apos;t expect the record . 
earlier , newly-crowned American sprint world champions Maurice Greene and Marion Jones were warned that they have a tough fight on her hands to stay at the top when both were beaten over 100 metres . 
Greene finished second behind Namibia &apos;s Frankie Fredericks who won in 9.98 seconds . 
Greene finished one-hundreth of a second behind . 
Jones failed to match the strong finish of Jamaican Merlene Ottey and also had to settle for second , one-hundreth of a second behind the 37-year-old Ottey who won the women &apos;s 100 in 10.96 .
