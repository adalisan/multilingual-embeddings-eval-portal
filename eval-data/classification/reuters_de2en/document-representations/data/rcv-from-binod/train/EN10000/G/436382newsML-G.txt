lawyers defending the doomsday cult guru accused in Tokyo &apos;s subway gassing said on Wednesday they will boycott one of four scheduled hearings each month to protest the pace of the trial . 
&quot; I have no intention of following the court &apos;s rigid schedule all the way into my coffin , &quot; said Osamu Watanabe , chief of the 12 lawyers appointed to defend cult guru Shoko Asahara . 
last week , Watanabe &apos;s team tendered their resignations saying they could not fulfill their responsibility if the current pace of court proceedings continued . 
the court on Monday rejected the lawyers &apos; resignations and also rejected their demands to decrease the number of hearings from four to three per month . 
Watanabe said his biggest concern was that the court was trying to push through the trial because Japanese society had presupposed that the defendant was guilty . 
the lawyers would take part in Thursday &apos;s hearings but will not be present for Friday &apos;s session and will boycott one of four hearings scheduled in April , Watanabe told a news conference . 
murder trials in Japan cannot be held without the presence of the defendant &apos;s lawyer . 
Japan has no jury system , and the judge has precedence in setting the pace of the trial . 
Tokyo District Court spokesmen refused to comment on the case . 
chief Judge Fumihiro Abe was expected to address the issue during Thursday &apos;s session . 
Watanabe &apos;s team was appointed last year to defend Asahara , leader of the Aum Shinri Kyo ( Supreme Truth sect ) who is accused of the March 1995 subway nerve gas attack , which killed 12 people and harmed 6,000 others . 
Asahara also faces 16 other charges ranging from murder to drugs and weapons production . 
the maximum penalty for a single murder conviction is death by hanging . 
dubbed the &quot; Trial of the Century &quot; by the Japanese media , Asahara &apos;s defence has been dogged by controversy since he fired his personal lawyer on the eve of the opening session in October 1995 . 
the trial finally started last April after the appointment of Watanabe &apos;s team , which cannot be fired by the defendant . 
Asahara has not entered a plea and the trial has often been marred by Asahara &apos;s outbursts against the judges , prosecutors , witnesses and even his lawyers . 
he has been evicted from court on several occasions .
