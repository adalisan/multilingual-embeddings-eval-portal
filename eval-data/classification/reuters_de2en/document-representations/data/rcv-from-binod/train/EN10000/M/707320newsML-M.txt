Hungary &apos;s forint opened weaker against the dollar on Friday but after an hour &apos;s trading it had rebounded , tracking the dollar / mark cross , dealers said . 
at the opening , the forint was quoted at 188.20 / 25 to the dollar , down from Thursday &apos;s 188.14 / 19 close , but by 0800 GMT it had firmed to 187.94 / 99 . 
the forint remained strong versus the National Bank of Hungary &apos;s ( NBH ) currency basket and remained pinned to the NBH resistance level ( bid ) in quiet trading as U.S. markets were closed for the Independence Day holiday , dealers said . 
they added that the forint was likely to remain strong but turnover would be lower than on Thursday , when a flow of foreign capital onto the Budapest Stock Exchange and other markets pushed the forint to the NBH bid in heavy volume . 
&quot; Everybody is tired at the end of the week , we will only have a morning session today and the U.S. market is closed , &quot; said Gabor Jakab of BNP-Dresdner Bank .
