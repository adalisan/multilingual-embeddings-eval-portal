the newly-elected leader of Socialist deputies in the French National Assembly will stand trial in Nantes , western France , on charges of favouritism in the award of a public works contract , justice sources said on Thursday . 
they said the charge against Jean-Marc Ayrault , who is also deputy mayor of Nantes , arose from a 1995 inquiry into the office of information and communication , a part of the Nantes city hall . 
at issue was the award , on a non-competitive basis , of an advertising contract for a city magazine to a Nantes advertising agency . 
no date was given for the trial . 
if convicted , Ayrault could be jailed for up to two years and fined as much as 200,000 francs ( $ 34,000 ) .
