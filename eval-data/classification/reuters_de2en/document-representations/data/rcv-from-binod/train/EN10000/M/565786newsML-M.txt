Croatian stocks closed mostly weaker on Wednesday in modest trade and market participants expected a bearish trend to persist through this week . 
&quot; Today was a disaster . 
there were fewer transactions and most shares fell , &quot; said one trader with a large market share . 
&quot; We are not likely to see a strong recovery any time soon . 
Josko Milisa , chief trader at I.C.F. 
brokerage , also saw no end to the current stagnation until foreign investors returned to the tiny market more aggressively . 
volume fell to 7,567 units from Tuesday &apos;s 11,386 , with turnover rising very slightly to 5.6 million kuna . 
nine of 15 issues fell on Wednesday , five rose and one ended flat . 
both blue chips Pliva and Zagrebacka Banka dipped . 
Pliva lost six kuna or 1.24 percent to 478 kuna in two straight deals totalling 1,000 shares . 
Zagrebacka &apos;s ordinaries fell 50 kuna or 2.3 percent to 2,150 kuna on volume of 1,632 units . 
&quot; In part this is an expected correction after too steep a rise , but it also follows a drop in London , &quot; said the first trader . 
he referred to trade in Pliva &apos;s and Zagrebacka &apos;s global depositary receipts ( GDRs ) which nudged lower to $ 16 and $ 35.12 respectively . 
but Milisa pointed out the bank &apos;s E-series preferred stock , rising 16 kuna to 1,099 , for being less susceptiple to London price movements . 
holders of these shares have a guaranteed dividend of seven percent on their 100-mark nominal price . 
the third fully-listed firm Varazdinska Banka was not traded on Wednesday . 
both its ordinary and bearer shares will be split and reissued at 100 kuna later this month . 
food stock Podravka with 2,919 units sold at an average 297 kuna was the day &apos;s most active issue . 
it lost 1.64 percent from Tuesday to close at 300 kuna . 
traders put this down to leaks about the firm &apos;s allegedly poor 1996 results , which are due to be released officially in 10-15 days . 
&quot; If ( Podravka &apos;s ) price goes below 300 kuna , the selling pressure could increase , &quot; one market watcher said . 
Zagreb &apos;s Hotel intercontinental led decliners , falling 11.76 percent since two weeks ago to 150 kuna on volume of 88 shares . 
top gainer was hotelier Arenaturist , up four kuna or 2.84 percent to 145 kuna on volume of 162 shares .
