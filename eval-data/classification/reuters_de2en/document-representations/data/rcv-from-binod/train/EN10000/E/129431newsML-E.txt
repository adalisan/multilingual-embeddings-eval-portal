the United States has won firm support from Asia-Pacific nations in its efforts to liberalise the global trade in information technology , a senior APEC official said on Sunday . 
Philippine foreign affairs undersecretary Federico ( RPT Federico ) Macaranas told a news conference that members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum had agreed to draw up a common stance on lowering tariffs on computers , telecommunications equipment and other &quot; info-tech &quot; products . 
this common stance would be presented at the World Trade Organisation ministerial meeting in Singapore in December , said Macaranas , chairman of an APEC senior officials &apos; meeting which ended in Manila on Sunday . 
details about the range of products to be covered and the timetable for tariff reductions still had to be worked out , he said . 
but he added : &quot; It is the desire of the senior officials that there be a collective stance on this . 
it will become a collective effort to move the ( U.S. information technology ) proposal . 
U.S. envoy to APEC John Wolff expressed satisfaction with the fruits of the senior officials &apos; meeting , the final formal session before an APEC ministerial meeting in Manila on November 22-23 and the leaders &apos; summit on November 25 . 
&quot; We have had excellent discussions ( on the info-tech proposal ) . 
the process has moved forward considerably , &quot; he told reporters . 
U.S. assistant trade representative for APEC Bob Cassidy stressed the information technology proposal had extensive knock-on effects through a whole range of industries which employed this type of equipment . 
&quot; automobiles , for example , are the biggest consumers of semiconductors in the world , &quot; he said . 
Cassidy added that the United States imported around $ 100 billion worth of information technology equipment a year , 80 percent of it from Asia-Pacific nations . 
&quot; We are net importers , &quot; he said , adding that the United States imported twice as much info-tech equipment as it exported . 
APEC officials have said agreement on the U.S. plan would underline the grouping &apos;s commitment to dropping all tariff and non-tariff trade barriers in the region by 2010 for developed members and 2020 for those who are less advanced . 
Macaranas said individual action plans ( IAPs ) for bringing this goal to reality had made substantial progress and several of APEC &apos;s 18 member economies had gone beyond their earlier commitments under the Uruguay Round of world trade talks . 
&quot; This to us is a landmark achievement of the IAPs , the fact that , voluntarily , economies are going beyond their Uruguay Round commitments , &quot; Macaranas said . 
APEC members now have until October 30 to finalise any revisions to their action plans , which will be harmonised into a collective action plan for ministers &apos; approval in November .
