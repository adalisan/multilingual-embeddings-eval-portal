Hungarian overnight rates rose in brisk trade on Friday as banks replenished their reserves at the end of the current reserve period before falling back as demand subsided . 
overnight rates began at Thursday &apos;s closing level of 21.00 percent then rose to 21.75 before dropping again to end at 21.00 percent . 
&quot; It was a busy morning , &quot; said Erika Kaiser of Budapest Bank . 
&quot; Heavy demand by banks pushed the rate up to 21.75 and it stayed there until demand fell away before the close . 
dealers expect rates to fall back on Monday now that the banks have fulfilled their reserve needs .
