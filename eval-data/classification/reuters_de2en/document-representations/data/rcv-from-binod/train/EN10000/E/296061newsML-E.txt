British Finance Minister Kenneth Clarke on Thursday urged Japan to forge ahead with economic reforms that he said Britain had found could hurt at first but ultimately yielded big rewards . 
Clarke , here to meet Japanese officials and business leaders , also said the outlook for Britain &apos;s economy was rosy and reiterated that Britain would make no decision on joining a single European currency until the &quot; last sensible moment &quot; . 
&quot; We did go through a pain barrier in a way but the pain was not that bad .... and the overall benefits to society as a whole are evident and are irreversible , &quot; Clarke said of Britain &apos;s own experience with deregulation and privatisation . 
Japan &apos;s Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has made economic reform , including liberalisation of the country &apos;s financial markets , a key pillar of his second administration sworn in late last year . 
in November he unveiled plans for a five-year &quot; Big Bang &quot; to open up Japan &apos;s financial markets and catch up with changes carried out in Europe and the United States more than a decade ago . 
but many analysts doubt whether Hashimoto &apos;s conservative Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) has the stomach for bold reforms which will hurt special interest groups long protected by regulations and government guidance . 
Clarke said that as a result of reforms begun in 1979 , Britain now had a more competitive and dynamic economy , one now enjoying sustained growth , low inflation and falling unemployment . 
&quot; The position in the United Kingdom is that we are seeing , for the first time , sustained growth with low inflation , &quot; he told Japanese executives . 
analysts have said that British interest rates might have to rise soon given the healthy economic data . 
some said the increase could come as early as January 15 , when Clarke is set to meet Bank of England governor Eddie George for their monthly discussion of monetary policy . 
Clarke told reporters after meeting his Japanese counterpart that Britain was on course to meet its inflation target of 2.5 percent and said he would continue to adopt policies to achieve that aim . 
but he added : &quot; I shall do that only at the proper time , having looked at all the data . 
Clarke , the leading pro-European in Prime Minister John Major &apos;s cabinet , said Britain would stay heavily involved in talks on creating a single European currency , but reserve a decision on joining &quot; til the last sensible moment . 
major , who must call elections by May , has been under pressure from &quot; Eurosceptics &quot; in his divided party to differentiate itself from Labour by ruling out British membership in a single European currency for at least five years . 
Clarke said the single currency was likely to go ahead , though not necessarily by its target date of January 1 , 1999 , and added that it was not yet clear which countries would meet the strict criteria set for joining . 
Clarke also told the executives , many of whom were likely to have Japan &apos;s weakening currency and slumping stock market on their minds on Thursday , that the Group of Seven ( G7 ) leading nations was not targetting exchange rates and in any case had a limited ability to determine currency levels .
