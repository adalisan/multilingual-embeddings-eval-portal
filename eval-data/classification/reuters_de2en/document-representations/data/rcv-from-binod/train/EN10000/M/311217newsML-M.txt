European oil swaps were dragged lower on Thursday after crude oil extended its selloff , while gas oil cracks were steady as futures prices jumped higher . 
IPE Feb gas oil tacked on $ 5.50 to $ 219 a tonne on the back of crude &apos;s late rally on Wednesday and because of the Arctic air blasting across parts of the U.S. 
&quot; It looks relatively stable , &quot; said one distillate swaps trader . 
third quarter gas oil cracks traded at $ 4.75 and $ 4.79 , roughly unchanged from deals on Wednesday at $ 4.81 , he said . 
jet fuel swaps were also steady with Feb last heard at a $ 33 / $ 34 premium , he said . 
crude oil swaps fell after IPE March Brent dropped another 35 cents a barrel late in the day to $ 23.30 a barrel , while the February contract , which expires at the close on Thursday , was off 29 cents at $ 23.55 . 
weekly Brent CFDs fell up to seven cents for the next three weeks , with Jan 20-24 at + 12 / + 15 cents over March Brent , Jan 27-31 at a + 10 / + 15 cent premium and Feb 3-7 now + 5 / + 9 cents over March Brent . 
fuel oil swaps also fell in active trading under the weight of weaker physical prices , where ample supply and sluggish bunker demand pushed barge values lower , brokers said . 
high sulphur fuel oil barges were last heard at $ 103 / $ 105 for the rest of January and February and March . 
low sulphur cargoes were also near flat for the next few months , at about $ 108 / $ 109 . 
gasoline swaps held some of their early gains after NYMEX Feb prices bounced back to above unchanged , although the focus remained on the closed arbitrage and relatively thin European demand . 
Feb gasoline swaps added a few dollars to $ 217 / $ 218 while March rose $ 2 to $ 219 / $ 220 a tonne .
