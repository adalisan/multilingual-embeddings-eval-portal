German government bonds will offer good opportunities to investors and are likely to outperform U.S. treasuries in coming weeks as the German economy continues to weaken , analysts said on Thursday . 
&quot; The economy is still very much on its knees with the weak orders numbers yesterday and the shockingly large rise in unemployment , &quot; said Huw Roberts , at NatWest Capital Markets . 
he was speaking after Germany released data showing unemployment had risen to a post-World War Two record of 4.66 million in January from 4.1 million in December . 
&quot; Germany has already got a very easy monetary policy stance and it doesn &apos;t appear to be paying any dividends at the moment . 
it &apos;s got to beg the question , do they need to ease monetary policy further ? 
&quot; asked Roberts , a European bond strategist . 
analysts said the outlook for the government bond , or Bund , market was particularly positive against a backdrop of continued solid growth in the U.S. 
the Federal Reserve &apos;s Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) kept U.S. monetary policy unchanged at its meeting this week -- although many analysts believe a rate hike is just a matter of time . 
Michael Lewis , senior economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell ( DMG ) in London , said growth in the U.S. was better than in Germany , and the focus will now switch to the March FOMC meeting . 
this was likely to lead to Bunds outperforming U.S. treasuries , he said . 
&quot; We &apos;re still looking for high U.S. yields , so in terms of Bunds we are continuing to see upward potential , &quot; he said . 
the spread between 10-year U.S. T-notes and Bunds is currently showing an 88 basis point , or 0.88 percentage point , premium in U.S. yields . 
the Bundesbank decided on Thursday to keep its repo rate unchanged at a fixed 3.0 percent for the next two securities repurchase tenders . 
the announcement was made after the regular meeting of the Bundesbank &apos;s policy council . 
Julian Jessop , European economist at Nikko Europe in London , said the unemployment figures did not directly influence the Bundesbank &apos;s monetary policy . 
&quot; The Bundesbank has always regarded unemployment as a structural problem which can &apos;t be solved by monetary policy , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But , as part of the bigger picture they are important . 
the high level of unemployment would suppress business and consumer confidence , he said , thus ultimately playing a part in any decision on interest rates . 
Lewis said further out , the unemployment data would not be completely positive for Bunds as it could lead to increased government spending and affect the budget deficit . 
&quot; That will lead to continued weak growth and the chances that the three percent ( Maastricht Treaty ) target will not be reached , &quot; he said . 
&quot; This period is going to be a bit of an aberration . 
he was referring to the economic criteria that EU counctries must meet if they are to join a single European currency . 
the economy would remain weak in the first quarter , which would be supportive to German bonds , but Lewis saw some modest growth coming through after that . 
&quot; So it is maybe a bit of an exaggerated picture for Germany right now , &quot; Lewis said . 
Roberts also expected Germany to outperform both against the European high yielders and against the U.S. , where he saw the spread likely to widen through 100 basis points . 
&quot; The economic situation does suggest the backdrop for Bunds is very benign , &quot; he said . 
&quot; If we do get any sell-offs , for example tomorrow on the U.S. payrolls , it is just a better buying opportunity . 
there is nothing to really threaten the Bund market .
