a Turkish state security court on Friday charged five more Islamists with inciting people to rebellion and to kill one another in a play , bringing the total charged to 23 , the state-run Anatolian news agency said . 
the Ankara state security court on Thursday arrested 18 people for putting on the Islamist play last month in an eastern province of the country . 
the suspects face at least 20 years in jail if found guilty for breaking the article 149 of the Turkish Penal Code , the agency said . 
Anatolian gave no more details about the play , called &quot; An enemy of God &quot; , which has angred the strictly secularist army . 
the powerful military has led a chorus of secularist uproar against attempts by Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan to relax strict restrictions on the role of Islam in public life .
