South Africa &apos;s Inkatha Freedom Party has asked for meetings with the National Party and Democratic Party before deciding finally whether to return to the Constitutional Assembly , strategist Walter Felgate said on Wednesday . 
Felgate told Reuters late on Wednesday he had not had a chance to brief party leader and Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi on his talks earlier in the day with CA chairman Cyril Ramaphosa . 
&quot; Mr Buthelezi has been involved in cabinet business all day and we have asked for meetings with the NP and the DP before we make up our minds , &quot; he said . 
a four-man Inkatha delegation met an African National Congress team including Ramaphosa and Constitutional Affairs Minister Mohammed Valli Moosa on Wednesday to seek a way back into the constitutional talks it abandoned early last year . 
Felgate told Reuters after the meeting that Inkatha wanted to make a genuine contribution , but would need to be able to put local government , provincial powers and the role of traditional authorities on the agenda .
