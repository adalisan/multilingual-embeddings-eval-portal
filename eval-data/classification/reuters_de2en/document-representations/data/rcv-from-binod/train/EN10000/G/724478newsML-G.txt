the confirmed death toll from floods sweeping Bangladesh rose to 46 on Saturday , while nearly 20 other people were missing after a boat capsized in a flooded river , officials said . 
six people died in a massive landslide in the Lama area of Bandarban district on Saturday evening , they said . 
around 20 people were missing , feared drowned , after the boat overturned and sank in the nearby Sangu River . 
four other people were buried under tonnes of mud earlier on Saturday in the Kalaghat area of Bandarban district , police said . 
&quot; The situation is deteriorating with continuing rain easing out earth and causing mudslides one after another , &quot; one official told Reuters in Chittagong . 
the floods , caused by heavy monsoon rain , left a quarter of a million homeless , officials said . 
at least half a million people were reported marooned in their half-submerged homes as floods triggered by torrential rain gripped 19 out of the country &apos;s 64 administrative districts . 
worst hit were 10 southeast districts , including Chittagong , the Chittagong Hill Tracts and Cox &apos;s Bazar . 
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina asked the armed forces to be on standby for emergency relief and rescue operations , as the flood situation might worsen . 
floodwater filled the entire town of Bandarban in Chittagong Hill Tracts , forcing thousands of residents to flee into surrounding hills . 
offices , business centres , police stations and army garrisons were evacuated , one Bandarban official said . 
&quot; Telecommunication with Bandarban ( 90 km from Chittagong ) could break down anytime , &quot; a police wireless operator said . 
officials and police earlier said victims of the floods , which started on Tuesday , died in landslides , house cave-ins and by drowning . 
at least 100 people have been injured , they said . 
unofficial sources on Saturday night put the death toll at 60 or above . 
weather officials said the floods could spread further and death counts could go up with more rains expected in next few days . 
the Chittagong weather office said it recorded more than 200 millimetres ( 7.8 inches ) of rain over a 24-hour period ending at 6 p.m. ( 1200 GMT ) on Saturday . 
heavy showers on Saturday disrupted life in the Bangladesh capital Dhaka , a city of nine million people , many of whom live in slums . 
low areas on the city &apos;s outskirts were inundated . 
more than 50,000 people were shifted to flood shelters and many more moved to higher ground on their own . 
the official BSS news agency said some 10,000 people in 13 flood shelters in Bandarban were facing severe shortages of food , but efforts to send supplies by helicopter proved futile because of rain and gusty wind . 
road links between Chittagong and neighbouring districts , including Cox &apos;s Bazar , were reported impassable as floodwater washed away several small bridges and partly inundated highways . 
train communications were disrupted because tracks were flooded or under threat . 
handling of cargo at the Chittagong port was hampered , port officials said . 
the national airline Bangladesh Biman said flights to and from Chittagong were delayed or suspended . 
movement of ships at Chittagong port became risky because of strong currents and waves at the Karnaphuli River linking the port to the Bay of Bengal . 
work at the country &apos;s second sea port at Mongla , in Khulna district , was also partially disrupted . 
the flooding has also disrupted communications with northeastern districts of Sylhet , Sunamganj and Habiganj . 
around 3,000 buses and lorries were stranded on both sides of the Jamuna River , disrupting communications between Dhaka and 16 northern districts , after rain washed away parts of ferry terminals , state television said on Saturday . 
at least 300,000 acres ( 120,000 hectares ) of cropland , including tea districts , have been inundated .
