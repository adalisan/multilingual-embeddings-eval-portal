LIFFE sugar was tightly mixed by late morning , in thin , directionless trade , with the focus still on August and October . 
October was 10 lower at $ 326.60 , while October was 10 cents higher at $ 317.00 . 
market players were getting ready for August to go off the board , one trader said . 
&quot; People are tidying up positions , &quot; he said . 
a lack of any market-moving fundamental news meant that there was little direction , he said . 
but there was some selling on December , ahead of the EU &apos;s tender on Wednesday . 
December fell $ 1.20 to $ 313.60 . 
the European Union &apos;s 1996 / 97 sugar export target could be achieved following a recent upsurge in trade demand , Commission officials said on Tuesday . 
with three more tenders before the current export campaign closes on July 30 , the EU still has 232,000 tonnes of sugar to export to meet its target . 
&quot; It could still be done . 
we have the technical possibility to complete the programme , &quot; a Commission official said .
