Europe &apos;s top security body , the OSCE , on Thursday gave its blessing to an international protection force for Albania but said it wanted an endorsement for the force from the United Nations Security Council . 
Albania was swept by violence in January when a string of savings schemes collapsed , costing ordinary people millions of dollars . 
rebels seized the southern part of the country in March and since then armed gangs have roamed the area , stealing , looting and killing . 
the OSCE ( Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ) said in a statement it expected that states willing to participate in an Albanian protection force would act &quot; in accordance with the United Nations Charter and OSCE principles and in accordance with appropriate action by the U.N. Security Council . 
in a separate statement released at the end of a meeting of the OSCE permanent council , Italy said it would seek an endorsement for a foreign protection force by the UN . 
&quot; With regard to the reference in today &apos;s decision to appropriate action by the UN Security Council , my country intends to undertake early steps to promote urgent initiatives in that regard , &quot; the Italian statement said . 
several countries including Italy , Greece , France , Spain and Portugal have said they are ready to send troops . 
non-EU members Turkey and Romania have also expressed willingness to take part . 
Italy said the operation would work on the basis of &quot; a minimum use of force &quot; . 
it said the aim was to create a secure environment for international aid organisations working in the crisis-hit Balkan nation and help prepare elections which are due by June . 
Italy estimated around 2,500 troops would initially be deployed . 
it said the length of the mission would be determined by circumstances in Albania . 
in Tirana , Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino met a European delegation headed by Dutch diplomat Jan de Marchant et d &apos;Ansembourg on Thursday and repeated his call for foreign help to protect relief supplies , Tirana airport and the main ports . 
d &apos;Ansembourg &apos;s team includes experts from OSCE , the European Union and its executive Commission and the Council of Europe , which safeguards human rights . 
in the latest outbreak of violence ravaging Europe &apos;s poorest nation , gunmen on Wednesday night sprayed bullets at a bus near the capital Tirana , killing one and injuring seven .
