cocoa futures are likely to push higher after consolidating the recent gains , with September seen challenging the key 1,162 stg resistance , technical analysts said on Tuesday . 
traders called the market to open 10-15 stg higher . 
the September contract cleared a key hurdle at 1,150 stg to hit an intraday high of 1,151 before settling the day at 1,150 . 
the market had been capped at 1,150 for three sessions in a row . 
Elli Gifford , an independent technical analyst , said the chart outlook for cocoa remained positive . 
&quot; After the recent sharp rally , prices should have jumped much higher , &quot; she said . 
&quot; I think there &apos;s a chance for the market doing that now . 
the immediate support was firmly established at 1,130 stg . 
on the upside , the initial target after 1,150 was the June 24 &apos;s peak of 1,162 , which she described as a major stumbling block . 
&quot; Basically , the market is more likely to go up than down . 
there &apos;s a good chance of further rises if 1,130 support holds , &quot; she said . 
on Monday , New York &apos;s cocoa futures ended sharply higher as a wave of speculative and local short-covering drove values up some $ 30 a tonne across the board . 
traders said the rally was mainly technically-driven , with upward momentum accelerating after the benchmark September contract broke through key chart resistance at $ 1,699- $ 1,701 a tonne , activating buy stops and attracting new fund buying . 
continued reports of an El Nino weather pattern , which some forecasters predicted could be the worst in 50 years , provided underlying support as traders worried about its impact on cocoa-growing areas . 
&quot; scattered talk of El Nino has been resurfacing , &quot; Dean Witter analyst Corey Bell said in New York on Monday . 
&quot; Also , there &apos;s the fact of July first tender in London and some concerns about what the delivery situation will be . 
after the New York market had closed , the exchange said total open interest in cocoa futures set a new record high on Friday when it reached 105,801 contracts outstanding .
