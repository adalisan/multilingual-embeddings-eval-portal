British Chancellor of the Exchequer ( finance minister ) Kenneth Clarke said in a television interview on Monday that strong growth in the UK economy would not lead to a recession . 
speaking on BBC Television &apos;s Newsnight , he said good economic figures would continue , and the country had prospects of sustained growth . 
&quot; Investment &apos;s been running well and getting stronger over the last year ... Our exports are standing up despite the strong pound , &quot; Clarke said . 
&quot; We have no balance of payments problem this time which we did in 1987 . 
he denied that the ruling Conservative government , trailing in the polls , had engineered a &quot; boom &quot; in the economy which would leave a difficult legacy for an incoming government . 
he said the one &quot; cloud on the horizon &quot; was the possibility that the opposition Labour Party , if it were elected in May , would upset the economy with a July budget . 
in the same interview , Labour economics spokesman Gordon Brown said current investment levels would not support a lasting recovery , although he said the economy was not actually booming . 
&quot; I think we &apos;re in danger of overheating because the fundamentals are not right , &quot; said Brown . 
asked about whether he would raise interest rates if he took over in May , and was requested to do so by governor of the Bank of England Eddie George , Brown refused to speculate .
