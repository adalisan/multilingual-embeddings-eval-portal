the Hong Kong market consolidated prior to the September 24 meeting of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee , with fixed-rate investors largely remaining on the sidelines . 
while U.S. economic indicators did not point to future U.S. interest rate movements , the market had fully priced in an expected 25 basis-point increase , HSBC Markets said . 
after the Fed opted to hold monetary policy steady , a buying spree emerged , HSBC Markets said . 
it said buying interest mostly stemmed from pent-up demand , which helped drag yields down by some 15 basis points for three-year paper and 25 basis points for five-year paper . 
steepness in the Hong Kong dollar yield curve and the high liquidity in the short-term money market continued to provide the momentum for investor demand , HSBC Markets said . 
it noted that two supranationals took advantage of the buoyant market conditions to tap the local of debt market . 
looking forward , HSBC Markets said it expects investors will consider price dips as good buying opportunities on views that interest rates will remain stable ahead of the Fed &apos;s next policy-setting meeting in mid-November .
