England midfielder Paul Gascoigne signed a new three-year contract with Scottish champions Rangers on Friday , ending speculation over his future . 
Gascoigne , 30 , signed the deal after &quot; brief and amicable &quot; discussions with Rangers who have won the Scottish title for the last nine seasons . 
he joined the club from Lazio in May 1995 for 4.3 million pounds ( $ 7.3 million ) and turned down approaches from Tottenham , one of his former clubs , as well as Middlesbrough and Sunderland , to stay at Ibrox . 
Rangers chairman David Murray said : &quot; Paul has been a tremendous servant to Rangers . 
he has helped us win two championships . 
&quot; When he is playing the way he can there is no criticism . 
the problems are when he is not playing . 
Murray also said that Gascoigne &apos;s disciplinary record on the pitch has improved considerably and was much better than in the past . 
Rangers have been busy in the transfer market this summer in an attempt to make a real impact in the European Cup and Champions League next season .
