Brazil is seeking bids from banks to lead manage a 10-year 500 million Deutsche mark ( $ 305 million ) Eurobond , Gazeta Mercantil reported . 
banks told the newspaper they were asked to present bids in about a week to the government , which apparently wants to create a yield curve in the mark Eurobond market for Brazilian paper . 
Brazil issued a three-year one billion mark Eurobond in 1995 , the paper said . 
the paper said traders thought a 10-year bond could price at about 365 basis points over the equivalent German treasury bond . 
the market had speculated that Brazil was mulling a large dollar global bond following the success of Argentina &apos;s 20-year $ 2.0 billion issue this week . 
but Brazil watchers said recent political problems in Brasilia might delay a large sovereign debt issue this quarter .
