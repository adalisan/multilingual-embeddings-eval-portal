a humiliated Benazir Bhutto weighed her options on Tuesday after her rival , ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif , headed for a landslide win in Pakistan &apos;s general elections . 
Sharif , an industrialist who led Pakistan from 1990 to 1993 , was expected to declare victory in his home city of Lahore , capital of Punjab province , the bedrock of his support . 
sources in Bhutto &apos;s battered Pakistan People &apos;s Party ( PPP ) said she might decide after meeting party leaders in Islamabad on Wednesday to boycott the national and provincial assemblies . 
with 139 results declared for the 217-seat National Assembly ( lower house ) , the PPP had won only seven seats , mostly in Sindh province , against 105 for Sharif &apos;s Pakistan Muslim League ( PML ) . 
PPP leaders have protested at what they call widespread vote-rigging and irregularities in Monday &apos;s elections , but foreign election observers say they saw nothing that would have altered the outcome -- a stinging defeat for Bhutto . 
Cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan &apos;s Tehrik-i-Insaaf ( Justice Movement ) secured no seats . 
the Karachi-based ethnic Mohajir National Movement ( MQM ) won 10 seats and the Awami National Party , based in North West Frontier Province and allied to the PML , gained eight . 
most of the seats declared were from populous Punjab , where the PML was also sure to dominate the provincial assembly . 
turnout was low in Monday &apos;s elections at the end of a lacklustre campaign during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan . 
Bhutto flew to Islamabad from her home village of Naudero in the southern province of Sindh and party workers said she might hold a news conference at about 5 : 00 p.m. ( 1200 GMT ) . 
&quot; The pressure on Benazir is that her defeated candidates cannot believe the results , so the party will probably stay away from the assemblies in protest at the rigging , &quot; one said . 
an air of gloom settled over Bhutto &apos;s farmhouse at Naudero earlier as results broadcast on state television showed the extent of the disaster for the PPP . 
&quot; It &apos;s unbelievable , just unbelievable , &quot; muttered one depressed party official . 
President Farooq Leghari called the elections after sacking Bhutto &apos;s government on November 5 , citing corruption , nepotism and other abuses . 
Bhutto denies the charges . 
the MQM also complained of election irregularities and intimidation by the breakaway MQM-Haqiqi faction . 
but the head of a Commonwealth team of observers said the voting had been free and mainly peaceful . 
&quot; We are satisfied that all those who wished to vote were able to do so and express their own wishes at the ballot box , &quot; former Australian prime minister Sir Malcolm Fraser said . 
nevertheless , 10 people were killed in election day violence around the country , officials said . 
the Karachi stock market welcomed the election result with a buying spree that sent the 100-share index soaring 52.86 points , or 3.31 percent , to close at 1,650.12 points , dealers said . 
PML secretary general Sartaj Aziz , who served as finance minister in the last Sharif government and may regain the post , said Pakistan must project a stable image and avoid a repeat of power struggles between the president and the prime minister . 
asked about Leghari &apos;s creation last month of a new Council for Defence and National Security , he said the new parliament would see how it functioned before deciding on its future . 
&quot; I think there are a lot of legitimate functions that can be performed within the existing constitutional framework , in other words without giving the president executive powers , which the constitution does not give , &quot; he told Reuters . 
the past four governments , including two led by Benazir Bhutto and one by Sharif , have been sacked by presidents , who have controversial powers to dissolve the National Assembly .
