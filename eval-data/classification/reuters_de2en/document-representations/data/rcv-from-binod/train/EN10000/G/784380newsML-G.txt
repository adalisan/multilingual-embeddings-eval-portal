bacteria and viruses could cause heart attacks but it is too soon to start treating heart disease patients with antibiotics , a team of British experts said on Friday . 
they said studies done so far on the possible link between microbes and heart disease were too tentative . 
John Danesh and colleagues at Oxford University , working with a grant from the British Heart Foundation , examined recent published studies on the association between bacteria and viruses and heart attacks . 
they looked specifically at reports about the bacteria chlamydia pneumoniae , which cause a chest infection and are related to a sexually transmitted disease , and Helicobacter pylori , which cause stomach ulcers . 
they also looked at cytomegalovirus , a herpes virus that can cause blindness . 
in all , they perused 20 studies on the possible link between infection and heart disease . 
&quot; The available evidence about chronic infections and CHD ( coronary heart disease ) is still sparse , &quot; they wrote in a report in the Lancet medical journal . 
the links were clear , they said -- but still circumstantial . 
&quot; compared with people without heart disease , those who have had heart attacks are more likely to have evidence of chlamydia pneumoniae infection in their blood and in diseased parts of their blood vessels , &quot; Danesh said in a statement . 
but that does not prove it is the culprit . 
&quot; chlamydia pneumoniae may just be an innocent bystander in diseased blood vessels , &quot; he added . 
they had similar doubts about Helicobacter pylori , a common bacteria that lives in the stomach and infects up to half the population . 
&quot; poorer people are more likely to have Helicobacter infections and , for quite separate reasons , may be more likely to have heart attacks , &quot; Danesh said . 
&quot; This needs to be taken into account when studying these associations . 
researchers have noted there are biological routes by which infections could cause heart disease . 
one is inflammation in general , which can cause a reaction in the arteries . 
infection can also make the blood more likely to clot . 
&quot; Although the researchers have found a stronger case for chlamydia pneumoniae than for other infections , it still has not been shown to cause heart disease , &quot; said Vivienne Press , medical director of the British Heart Foundation . 
&quot; Much larger studies would be needed of the associations between these infections and heart disease which take account more fully of other heart disease risk factors . 
the evidence linking infections to heart disease first emerged in the 1970s , when experimentally bred chickens infected with a virus developed clogged arteries . 
last month , Sandeep Gupta of St George &apos;s Hospital Medical School in London said he had found chlamydia in the fatty deposits clogging the arteries of heart attack patients -- and he said treating them with antibiotics reduced the rate of second heart attacks .
