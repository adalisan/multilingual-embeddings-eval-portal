the Malaysian ringgit continued to tumble against the dollar on Monday , hitting a 42-month low as sales from offshore investors went virtually unchallenged , foreign exchange dealers said . 
the ringgit sank to a low of 2.7430 per dollar , its weakest level since February 1994 . 
&quot; Some profit-taking is setting in but it is well absorbed by dollar-buying interest , &quot; a dealer with a Malaysian bank said . 
&quot; The dollar met little resistance mainly because local exporters have already sold almost all of their dollar positions at 2.67 / 2.68 . 
most dealers expect further losses in the near term . 
some have not ruled out a slide to 2.80 , a level last seen in July 1991 . 
&quot; It &apos;s difficult to say at this point where the ringgit is heading , but I don &apos;t think we have seen the bottom yet , &quot; another Malaysian bank dealer said . 
&quot; Obviously 2.80 is the next psychological level , &quot; he said . 
a dealer with a European bank in Singapore said : &quot; buying interest in dollar / Malay among offshore parties is still very strong , especially U.S. funds and Hong Kong parties . 
the currency has remained under selling pressure since plunging two percent late on Friday shortly after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he was happy with the ringgit &apos;s level , dealers said . 
they said Mahathir &apos;s remarks were taken to mean that the central bank , Bank Negara Malaysia , would allow the ringgit to find its own level and would not intervene to stop the local unit from being sold . 
&quot; This was the last thing that the ringgit needed , given ( that ) regional currency woes ( were ) still pretty much unresolved , thus opening the way to more ringgit downside , &quot; research house I.D.E.A. 
said in a Monday commentary . 
the ringgit , like other Southeast Asian currencies , has been hit by speculative attacks over the past month , losing nearly 10 percent of its value . 
Bank Negara spent $ 2.0-3.0 billion of its reserves in June to defend the currency . 
dealers said they were surprised by Mahathir &apos;s remarks , following his earlier stinging verbal attacks on speculators and the introduction of capital control measures . 
Bank Negara last week ordered local banks to limit non-trade-related currency swaps to $ 2.0 million with each overseas customer in an attempt to reduce foreigners access to the ringgit . 
dealers and analysts said the ringgit was also pressured by a weak Malaysian stock market and fears of possible overheating in the economy . 
local shares continued to be battered by foreign fund selling , with the benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange composite Index closing down 3.24 percent to a 21-month low of 902.14 on Monday . 
concern about the economy followed Malaysia &apos;s surprisingly high loans and monetary growth figures for June , despite steps by Bank Negara to curb them . 
Bank Negara announced last Wednesday that broad money supply or M3 grew by 21.9 percent year-on-year in June against 20.3 percent in May and 22.9 percent in the same month last year . 
loan growth in June rose to an annualised 30 percent from 29.5 percent at the end of May . 
lending has remained strong despite the high interest rate environment that the central bank has maintained this year , in part to cool down the economy but also to defend the ringgit , analysts said . 
high interest rates have been cited as one of the reasons for the poor performance of the stock market as the cost of borrowing has risen for corporations .
