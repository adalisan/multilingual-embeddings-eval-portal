reactions to Wednesday &apos;s landmark meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat ranged from criticism to praise . 
following are Israeli and Palestinian reactions to the summit : 
-- Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres : 
&quot; This is a great moral victory for our path ... I also think on this day about ( slain Prime Minister ) Yitzhak Rabin . 
he ( Netanyahu ) needs to ask forgiveness from him . 
-- Right-wing Likud lawmaker Uzi Landau : 
&quot; ( The government ) doesn &apos;t stand on what it said it would stand on . 
the Arabs will become used to us continuing negotiations by giving concessions in the future without them having to carry out their past commitments ... there will be very sharp criticism in the Likud tomorrow . 
-- Palestinian Minister of Information Yasser Abed Rabbo : 
&quot; The main subject for us is the settlement activity and the need to stop it immediately . 
-- Yesha Council of Jewish settlers spokesman Aharon Domb : 
&quot; Benjamin Netanyahu is mistaken if he thinks he is assured the support of Yesha at any price . 
we are faithful to the idea of the Land of Israel and not to one man or another . 
-- Israeli Minister of Infrastructure Ariel Sharon : 
&quot; The meeting on that level was a mistake . 
-- Israel &apos;s Peace Now spokesman Alon Arnon : 
&quot; Peace Now congratulates Prime Minister Netanyahu for finally accepting reality and seeing that the devil is not as bad as he thought ... If it will not follow with results on the ground ... it will turn out to be a very small step . 
-- Palestinian self-rule councilman Hisham Abd-al Raziq : 
we have to work gradually and step by step . 
-- Hamas spokesman Mahmoud al-Zahhar : 
&quot; The policy of the Likud is for meetings to be targets . 
they will negotiate for negotiations until there is no substance to negotiate for . 
the negotiations will go for many years in the same place . 
-- Former Labour Party Police Minister Moshe Shahal : 
&quot; We saw this evening the greatest deception in Israeli politics . 
this was intentional , cynical fraud of a politician who wanted to get into power and his name is Bibi Netanyahu . 
during the election campaign he blasted Shimon Peres &apos;s handshake with Yasser Arafat as a central point against Shimon Peres . 
-- Hebron resident Najeh al-Hashlamoun : 
&quot; The fact that Netanyahu , one of the most hardline people in Israel , has met Arafat suggests that he may be willing to climb down further and achieve peace . 
the peace agreement does not concern the two people , but the two peoples . 
-- Palestinian economics student Talal Salameh : 
the Israeli government stuck Arafat in a corner before the morning .
