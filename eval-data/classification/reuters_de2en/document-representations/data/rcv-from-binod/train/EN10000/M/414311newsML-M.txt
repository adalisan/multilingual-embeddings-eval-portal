turnover eased to 18.599 million shillings on 446,972 shares from 30.047 million shillings on 664,658 shares on Friday . 
&quot; Today &apos;s trading , very quiet , was an indicator of the market reaction to the announcements made by Barclays Bank and Standard Chartered Bank last week , &quot; a broker said . 
Barclays posted a 2.477 billion shillings ( $ 45.87 million ) profit after tax for the year ended December 31 , 1996 from 2.120 billion in the previous year and said it would give a dividend of seven shillings per share for a total dividend of 10 . 
standard Chartered posted a 1.149 billion shillings profit after tax compared to 1.129 billion shillings last year . 
it gave a final dividend of 1.75 for a total dividend of 3.0 . 
brokers said the Kenya Commercial Bank share price eased on hesitant trading from wary investors who decided to hold onto their shares until the bank released its results . 
a financial analyst said the sluggish pace of the market was mainly due to the fact that the market was dividend and bonus driven -- which he said did not reflect the value of the share . 
&quot; Investors , mainly the speculators were not only expecting generous dividends but also a bonus issue , &quot; a broker said . 
Barclays shed 5.0 to close at 109 , while Kenya Commercial Bank eased to 95 from 98.50 .
