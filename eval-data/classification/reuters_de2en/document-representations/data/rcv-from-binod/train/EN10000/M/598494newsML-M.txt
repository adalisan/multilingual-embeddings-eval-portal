Belgian linear bond futures ended lower ahead of the FOMC meeting on Tuesday , with news on U.S. rates due after the close of trade here , but the OLO / yield spread remained stable at nine BP and was seen staying in a five to fifteen BP range . 
dealers said the small OLO exchange auction -- just five billion francs -- was easily digested . 
&quot; The terms of the auction were neutral . 
I guess nobody was particularly interested in lengthening his duration , &quot; one dealer said . 
at these auctions , banks can exchange OLOs close to maturity ( which are tantamount to cash ) for OLOs with longer maturities . 
dealers said they saw some cash buying by investors and also reported some further curve flattening . 
but overal trade was quiet , with large players sidelined ahead of the U.S. rate decision . 
money market rates edged up as the franc remained above the 20.64 level . 
one-week repo rates rose to 3.14 / 18 percent , from 3.10 / 12 on Friday . 
on Monday , the market was closed . 
dealers expect money rates to continue quoting well above the 3.00 percent central rate as long as the franc does not move back to its 20.5255 ERM central rate to the mark .
