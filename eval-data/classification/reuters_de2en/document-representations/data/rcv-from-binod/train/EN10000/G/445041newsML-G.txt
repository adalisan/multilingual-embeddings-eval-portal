a Sudanese minister was quoted as saying the United States was behind recent fighting in the south as it was &quot; obsessed &quot; with partitioning Sudan . 
Mostafa Othman Ismail , minister of state at the foreign ministry , was quoted in the private newspaper Akhbar al-Youm on Saturday as saying that a rebel offensive in the east in January was a ruse to distract the Sudanese army from the southern offensive , which Khartoum has blamed on Ugandan troops . 
&quot; The U.S. administration is obsessed with dismembering Sudan and besieging the Islamic government using local and regional forces , &quot; Ismail said . 
&quot; This plan to dismember Sudan is a clear one and is fully supported by international circles led by the United States and Britain , using regional powers led by Uganda , &quot; he added . 
Sudan has said hostile neighbours Eritrea , Ethiopia and Uganda have been fighting alongside rebels first in the east and more recently in the south . 
all three countries deny any involvement in the fighting . 
the rebels , under the command of the Sudan People &apos;s Liberation Army ( SPLA ) , say they are fighting the government of Lieutenant-General Omar Hassan al-Bashir singlehanded . 
for the past 13 years the SPLA has been fighting for greater autonomy for the mostly Christian and animist south . 
the rebels say they have captured the southern town of Yei this week and the Sudanese government says the weaponry they are using is evidence of foreign interference . 
it says some of the weapons are American-made . 
Ismail said that if the rebels did seize the town , it was &quot; part of an Eritrean , Ethiopian , Ugandan and American plot targeting Arab security and not the ( Sudanese ) government &quot; . 
Washington has put Sudan on its list of &quot; terrorist &quot; states .
