Cleveland officials said Thursday that a disagreement with Grigsby Brandford &amp; Co last week forced them to postpone an $ 82 million bond deal , a move that will significantly raise interest costs for the city . 
the bonds were finally brought to market Thursday by a new bookrunner , Smith Barney Inc , but rising interest rates over the past week mean the parking facilities refunding revenue bonds will now cost the city at least several hundred thousand dollars more . 
executives with Grigsby Brandford were not available to comment . 
in a statement released by Cleveland Mayor Michael White &apos;s press office , city Finance Director Kathryn Burrer Hyer said the city was unable to reach an agreement with Grigsby and therefore could not execute a bond purchase agreement last week . 
the statement did not provide details on what the disagreement was . 
Hyer added in the statement that the bonds were priced Thursday with the same underwriter group , although the city rearranged the order of the firms in the deal , placing Grigsby at the bottom of the list . 
gene Saffold , a director at Smith Barney , said the market had moved away from the deal by five to 10 basis points since last week . 
Grigsby was dropped to a co-manager position in Thursday &apos;s pricing , with A.G. Edwards &amp; sons Inc moving up to the co-senior manager slot Smith Barney held in the original pricing . 
Saffold said Cleveland decided to redo the management team after Grigsby Brandford couldn &apos;t resolve technical problems with the bond purchase agreement after last week &apos;s pricing . 
he added that Smith Barney was &quot; happy &quot; to take over the deal and that the firm expected to sign later Thursday essentially the same bond purchase agreement that caused Grigsby Brandford problems last week . 
&quot; None of the terms have changed , &quot; Saffold said , referring to the bond purchase agreement . 
he also noted that the preliminary official statement and the insurance policy for the bonds by mbia Insurance Corp , a unit of mbia Inc , were also unchanged from last week .
