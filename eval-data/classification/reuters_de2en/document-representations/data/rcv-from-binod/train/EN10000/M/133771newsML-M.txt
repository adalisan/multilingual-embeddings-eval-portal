the spot power market in the western U.S. was firm Tuesday amid the start of a 2-day schedulers meeting held by the Bonneville Power Administration ( BPA ) , trade sources said Tuesday . 
Portland , Ore.-based BPA said Monday that western utilities agreed to pre-schedule through Thursday in advance of the meetings . 
BPA is meeting today with Northwest utilities to discuss electronic bulletin board information on scheduling . 
meetings will take place Wednesday with other western utilities and power marketers , a Bonneville trader said . 
the line had been expected to return to 2,000 MW this week after being shut for maintenance since mid-October . 
but market sources said the constraints were having little impact on spot market prices , with loads fairly evenly balanced with generation in most regions . 
Next-day prices at the California-Oregon border ( COB ) were last quoted at $ 19.00-19.50 per megawatt hour ( MWh ) , little changed from Monday . 
Next-day Mid-Columbia prices were also little changed at $ 17.25-18.00 for peak power and $ 15.25-16.00 for off-peak .
