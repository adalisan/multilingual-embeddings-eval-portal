a relatively large monthly decrease of 2.2 percent in the price of imported crude oil helped keep the lid on South African producer price inflation in September , the Central Statistical Service said . 
the decrease contributed to a low 0.1 month-on-month increase in the cost of imported goods . 
but analysts noted this gain would be wiped out in succeeding months following a recent sharp increase in oil prices . 
among all commodities for South African consumption there were relatively large monthly increases in the cost of food at manufacturing ( + 0.7 percent ) , agricultural products ( + 2.1 percent ) , fish ( + 4.6 percent ) , textiles ( + 0.8 percent ) , wearing apparel ( + 2.5 percent ) , products of petroleum and coal ( + 1.7 percent ) and non-electrical machinery and equipment ( + 1.0 percent ) . 
these increases were offset by falls in the indices for mining and quarrying products ( -2.1 percent ) and electrcitiy ( -0.9 percent ) . 
import prices increased in the case of several manufactured goods including non-electrical machinery and equipment ( + 2.2 percent ) , food ( + 4.0 percent ) , beverages ( + 0.2 percent ) , paper ( + 0.3 percent ) , chemicals ( + 0.5 percent ) and transport equipment ( + 0.1 percent ) . 
but these increases were offset by falls in the cost of some primary sector imports , including mining and quarrying products ( -1.9 percent due to cheaper oil ) , agricultural food ( -4.5 percent ) and other agriculture ( -0.6 percent ) . 
September PPI came in significantly lower than expected at 0.4 percent month-on-month and 7.6 percent year-on-year .
