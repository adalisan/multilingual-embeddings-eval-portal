figures in brackets compare against previous day &apos;s close 
* Bills sell but on thin volume 
* Reaction to U.S. election seen the next driver 
new Zealand bonds held onto their early gains at Tuesday &apos;s close , to end five to eight points stronger across the curve . 
bonds had opened well bid , buoyed by offshore orders and rumours of another samurai bond issue , and sentiment remained positive on the day . 
the money market did not fare as well , with the 90-day rates climbing six basis points to 8.99 percent and the December futures contract shedding eight to 91.46 . 
however , bill dealers said trade had been very thin and the higher rates did not reflect the market &apos;s underlying tone . 
the 90-days were basically stuck in a range , they said . 
&quot; I just think there was a bit of a weak t-bill tender -- I don &apos;t think there is anything too sinister in it , &quot; one said . 
another put the lethargic trade down to the influence of the Melbourne Cup , which had overshadowed Australian trade . 
the U.S. presidential election was seen driving short term developments , with Friday &apos;s household Labour Force Survey the next local data expected to provide the market with some direction .
