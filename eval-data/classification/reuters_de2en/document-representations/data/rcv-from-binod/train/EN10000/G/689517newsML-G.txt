the United States called on the Egyptian government on Thursday to try to reimpose a ban , struck down by a court , on female circumcision . 
&quot; We believe that the ban was the right thing to do and they should make every effort to reimpose it , &quot; State Department spokesman John Dinger told reporters . 
in a ruling hailed by Islamic fundamentalists , an administrative court in Cairo declared the ban , decreed by the Health Ministry in July 1996 , null and void on Tuesday . 
the Egyptian government can appeal against the ruling . 
Dinger said the United States would continue to urge an end to what he called a form of violence against women . 
&quot; meanwhile we extend our sympathies to the girls who will suffer lasting physical and emotional injury and possible death from its resumption &quot; in Egypt , he said . 
female circumcision , usually performed on pre-pubescent girls , involves cutting part or all of the clitoris and other genitalia . 
the procedure sometimes includes sewing together the vaginal opening . 
side-effects may include haemorrhage , shock , sexual dysfunction and eventual gynecological and obstetric problems , according to international health experts . 
women &apos;s rights activists estimate that 6,000 girls a day across the world are subjected to circumcision . 
according to an Egyptian government study earlier this year , 97 percent of 14,779 Egyptian women polled had been circumcised .
