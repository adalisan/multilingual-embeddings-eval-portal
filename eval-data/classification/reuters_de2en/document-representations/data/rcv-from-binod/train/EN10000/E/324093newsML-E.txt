British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said on Wednesday that he would judge the level of interest rates by economic data and that the level of sterling was only one factor . 
&quot; I will continue to judge it by the data , &quot; he said in an interview with Channel Four television news when asked if he would be able to avoid raising rates before the next election , which must be held by May 22 at the latest . 
Clarke said of sterling : &quot; It &apos;s one of the things I look at . 
he noted that that a strong pound had a deflationary efffect , reducing costs for producers but robbing Britain of the value of its exports . 
he said the strength of the pound had arisen because the funadamentals of the British economy looked so attractive . 
&quot; In itself , it ( a strong pound ) is one of the things I take into account when setting interest rate policey , one of the things I take into account when keeping us on course , to make sure that whatever the value of the pound we get growth , jobs and low inflation , &quot; Clarke said . 
he said the prospect of joing the single European currency was &quot; alive &quot; , adding &quot; we might or we might not &quot; join . 
but this turned on many more issues than the strength of the pound , Clarke said . 
Clarke defended the government &apos;s decision on Wednesday to spend 60 million pounds of public money on a new Royal yacht for Queen Elizabeth , saying the expenditure would have no bearing on overall government spending . 
&quot; I am on course to deliver very tight public spending , healthy public finances , &quot; he said . 
the new yacht , with its opportunities for overseas trade promotion , was good for &quot; UK Limited &quot; , Clarke said . 
he said he had not given up being an &quot; Iron Chancellor &quot; just because an election was imminent . 
he said he was committed to spending no more than 40 percent of gross domestic product on public spending . 
he hoped Britain would have the most successful economy in Europe in the first decade of the next century .
