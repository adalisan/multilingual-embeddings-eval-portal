oil prices closed lower on Thursday as traders grew skeptical that the Organization of Petroleum exporting Countries would be able to rein in overproduction following pledges by members of the cartel to do so . 
in other markets , coffee prices fell as speculators sold heavily and corn and soybean prices also fell amid excellent growing weather in the Midwest . 
at the New York Mercantile Exchange , crude oil for August delivery closed 43 cents a barrel lower at $ 19.09 . 
OPEC oil ministers , meeting in Vienna to discuss production , decided to keep to a self-imposed 25.03 million barrel per day production ceiling even though the 11-member group &apos;s actual output has been running two million barrels above that level . 
Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali bin Ibrahim al-Naimi said OPEC had a high level of commitment from members towards keeping output allocations . 
but traders voiced skepticism . 
&quot; I see it as nothing but rhetoric , &quot; said prudential Securities analyst Richard Redash . 
&quot; There is too much foreign ivestment in some OPEC countries for them to to cut back production and risk not offering a return on investment . 
refined products tracked crude , with July gasoline ending 0.18 cent a gallon lower at 56.79 cents and July heating oil down 0.97 cent a gallon at 52.02 cents . 
at the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York , coffee futures ended sharply lower under pressure from speculators . 
coffee for September delivery fell 14.05 cents a pound to close at 166.10 cents . 
continued mild winter weather in top-grower Brazil and rising coffee stocks in exchange-certified warehouses contributed to selling by commodity fund speculators , who are now pushing the market lower after being buyers earlier this year as prices soared on supply worries . 
&quot; The funds were selling and they are getting short now , &quot; said Allendale Inc analyst Jim Cordier . 
&quot; The mild weather is just the nail in the coffin . 
I thought we were going to get to these price levels eventually , but warm weather is getting us there faster . 
the exchange said after Thursday &apos;s close that certified coffee stocks rose by another 246 bags as of June 25 to 46,173 bags . 
there were also 11,695 bags pending grading , it said . 
at the Chicago Board of Trade , soybeans fell to four-month lows in the face of favorable growing weather , poor weekly export sales and falling cash soybean values . 
soybeans for July delivery closed 16-1 / 4 cents a bushel lower at $ 8.00-1 / 2 . 
&quot; There are no worries about the crop right now , &quot; said Dale Durchholz , a grain analyst with AgriVisor Services in Bloomington , Ill . &quot; But you have to be careful getting complacent because we &apos;ve got a lot of growing season left . 
on Thursday , the Agriculture Department reported net export sales for the week ended June 19 for soybeans at a mere 9,200 metric tons , far below trade expectations for sales of 50,000 to 100,000 tons , indicating that this season &apos;s red-hot export demand may be cooling off . 
talk that China may cancel some of its earlier purhcases of soybeans and soymeal due to the recent drop in prices added to selling pressure , analysts said . 
the excellent crop conditions in the Midwest also caused selling in corn markets as the supply outlook brightened . 
corn for July delivery closed six cents a bushel lower at $ 2.50-1 / 4 cents , just above the fresh two-year low price of $ 2.50 set during the session . 
wheat prices bucked the trend to close higher , as export demand picked up and rainy weather caused harvest delays in Kansas and other regions where winter wheat is now being cut . 
wheat for July delivery ended at $ 3.33 , up 1-1 / 4 cents . 
U.S. exporters on Thursday said Pakistan had bought 500,000 tons of wheat , with the United States to provide 350,000 of the total . 
Paris-based sources said Algeria bought about 275,000 tons of wheat . 
&quot; Algeria took a little piece of U.S. ( wheat ) and Pakistan took a lot of U.S. , so there &apos;s some demand showing up , &quot; said Dave Armstrong , analyst for trade house ABN Amro-Chicago Corp.
