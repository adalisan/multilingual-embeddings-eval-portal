NYMEX heating oil ended sharply lower Tuesday on expectations the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) would show a bearish build in distillate stocks in its weekly oil inventory data . 
&quot; Heat was hit because people are expecting the Stats to show a bearish build , &quot; said ING Derivatives analyst Tom Bentz . 
November heating oil ended the day off 1.63 cents at 69.83 cents a gallon . 
gasoline and crude were caught under heat &apos;s downdraft , traders said . 
November gasoline ended 1.20 cents a gallon lower at 69.10 cents while December crude closed off 51 cents a barrel at $ 24.34 . 
selling was particularly seen in the refined product front months as traders rolled positions ahead of the November expiry Thursday . 
dealers said heating oil ended below 70.00 cents , psychological support , making it technically weak before the anticipated bearish news . 
record low inventories in heating oil has sent heat and crude prices to new post-Gulf War highs in October , but a view that heating oil stocks are being replenished has pushed oil prices lower in the past two weeks . 
&quot; There has been a change in psychology in the market with the effort to be build stocks by refiners , &quot; said ING &apos;s Bentz . 
Tuesday evening the API was expected to show a distillate stock build between one and three million barrels for the week ended October 25 . 
total distillate stocks include heating oil and deisel inventories . 
however , a cold snap could create a bullish scanerio once again for heating oil . 
&quot; Winter is not even here yet , and it may get really cold , &quot; said a trader . 
meanwhile , dealers expected gasoline stocks to fall between one and three million barrels to a new record low . 
refinery shutdowns have prompted short-term supply concerns , and a rise in gasoline prices . 
but , the low gasoline stocks are not expected to trigger as big a price rise as heating oil had since the market has been coping with near record-low gasoline stocks for some time , traders said .
