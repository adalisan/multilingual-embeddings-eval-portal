hundreds of thousands of tonnes of copper have moved through Chinese customs into central stocks and are staying put , despite fears the metal could be sold to take advantage of current high prices , traders said on Monday . 
&quot; It was a good decision to buy good quality metal at 85 to 90 ( U.S. ) cents a pound ; now they are feeling smug , &quot; a South American industry executive said of China &apos;s central authorities . 
&quot; It is central buying , there is no doubt about that because none of it is moving out , &quot; he said . 
China recently boosted central copper reserves by 300,000 tonnes , with most of it now having cleared customs formalities , although a lag in Chinese customs reporting may keep the figures off the books for a couple of months , trading sources said . 
few Chinese trading companies would have the financial resources to buy and then store substantial amounts of copper , a Shanghai trader said . 
the recent surge in world spot prices had been expected to fuel a flow of Chinese material on to the world market . 
but a modest rise last week in stocks held in London Metal Exchange ( LME ) warehouses in Singapore -- traders said about 3,000 tonnes -- indicated the Chinese material was staying home . 
&quot; It &apos;s a piddling amount , &quot; a trader in Hong Kong said of the increase in stocks in Singapore . 
LME copper trading has been volatile in recent weeks , with a moderate rise in stocks on Friday , the first since early September , pushing prices down on profit-taking and liquidation . 
three months copper finished Friday at US $ 2,242 , bouncing off support around $ 2,220 in the afternoon ring , dealers said . 
losses were kept to a minimum , they said , as market jitters centred on the upcoming December options declaration . 
the main concern was if December copper came close to $ 2,600 , where there was a large concentration of open interest on calls . 
with LME stocks at 92,475 tonnes and the spot price at 2,470.50 , the LME does not have enough copper to cover calls with a strike price of $ 2,600 , which total 168,750 tonnes . 
traders in Asia seemed largely uninterested in the Wednesday options expiry as China is seen to be flush with copper and not interested in selling . 
what little movement there has been out of China , some of which was possibly included in the 3,000-tonne hike in Singapore , was in small lots of probably no more than 1,000 tonnes at a time , the Shanghai trader said . 
while China was neither actively buying nor selling now , it would have to boost imports to keep pace with demand next year , traders said . 
&quot; The market is physically tight so it is very good for the producers , &quot; a marketing executive with a major producer said . 
he said China &apos;s crackdown on scrap imports , coupled with expected casualties among domestic smelters , would lead to total Chinese copper imports in 1997 of 830,000 tonnes . 
the opening in February or March of a new smelter in Anhui province near the top-of-the-line Tongling smelter would account for an increase over 1996 , he said . 
official customs figures show January to October 1996 imports of cast and unwrought copper were up 28.8 percent on 1995 , to 549,571 tonnes , with October imports 82,655 tonnes . 
the new smelter , a joint venture between Tongling and Japan &apos;s Itochu Corp and Sumitomo Corp had already booked 210,000 tonnes of concentrate imports for the year , the marketing executive said . 
&quot; They are looking at smelting 330,000 tonnes of concentrate , and producing 110,000 tonnes of metal , &quot; he said . 
in other base metal markets , premiums to Hong Kong remained largely unchanged .
