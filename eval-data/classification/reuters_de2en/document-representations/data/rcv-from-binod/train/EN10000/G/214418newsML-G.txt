Simpson &apos;s civil wrongful death trial on Monday attacked the former football star &apos;s alibi that he was home at the time his ex-wife and her friend were murdered . 
Attorney Daniel Petrocelli said Simpson , who took the witness stand for a second day of testimony , had changed his story about vital evidence in the case , giving two different versions of where his cellular phone was at particular times on the night of the murders , June 12 , 1994 . 
Petrocelli said Simpson had told police in an interview conducted the day after the murders that he had been driving in his Bronco and had made a call on the cellphone to his girlfriend , model Paula Barbieri . 
&quot; I was going to see my girlfriend , I was calling her but she wasn &apos;t around , &quot; Simpson said , according to a transcript of the interview read by Petrocelli . 
but Simpson &apos;s cellphone records showed the only call made that night was at 10 : 03 p.m. , putting Simpson in the Bronco at that time , Petrocelli said . 
Simpson has maintained he was at home from shortly after 9 p.m. until 11 p.m .. when he took a limousine to the airport for a trip to Chicago . 
the plaintiffs &apos; attorneys have attempted to prove the killings occurred around 10 : 40 p.m. , which they said would have given Simpson time to commit the murders outside Nicole Brown Simpson &apos;s townhouse and still get back to his mansion two miles ( 3 km ) away in time for the ride to the airport . 
Simpson told police in the interview his last action before leaving for the airport was to take his cellphone out of the Bronco . 
but on Monday he testified he had taken it out hours earlier . 
&quot; You don &apos;t want it to be in the Bronco at 11 p.m. 
if it &apos;s there at 10 p.m. then you weren &apos;t at home at 10 p.m. and that would destroy your alibi , wouldn &apos;t it , &quot; Petrocelli said . 
Simpson , who on Friday emphatically denied having killed his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman , was acquitted of the murders by a criminal court jury in October , 1995 . 
he is now being sued by the families of the victims who are seeking substantial financial damages . 
Simpson maintained on Monday that the transcript of the police interview was incomplete , that what he told police was that at around 11 p.m. on June 12 he had taken his cellphone accessories -- a carrying case , spare battery and an adaptor -- out of the Bronco . 
&quot; Your story now then is that you didn &apos;t make this ( 10 : 03 p.m. ) call from the Bronco , &quot; Petrocelli asked . 
&quot; That &apos;s correct , &quot; Simpson said . 
&quot; Your story now is that ... the cellphone wasn &apos;t in the Bronco at 10 : 03 p.m. , &quot; the attorney continued . 
&quot; correct , &quot; Simpson replied . 
&quot; You now say you took it out of the Bronco hours before , &quot; Petrocelli asked . 
&quot; Yes , &quot; Simpson said . 
&quot; It &apos;s different now , isn &apos;t it , &quot; Petrocelli said , referring to Simpson &apos;s testimony about the telephone . 
&quot; It &apos;s more accurate , &quot; Simpson replied . 
speaking in a clear voice and showing little emotion , Simpson told the jury that at one point during the two hours he was at home alone he chipped golf balls with a pitching wedge out of a sand pit in his children &apos;s play area . 
he said that at about 10 : 35 p.m. or 10 : 40 p.m. he realised he was running late and started to take a shower . 
he said he thought he heard a telephone ringing while he was in the shower and thought it might be the limousine driver trying to get through the gates to his mansion , but did not answer it because he did not want to get out of the shower .
