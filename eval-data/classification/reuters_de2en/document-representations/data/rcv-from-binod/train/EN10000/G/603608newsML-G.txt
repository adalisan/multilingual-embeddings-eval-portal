Indonesian authorities have blamed a left-wing group outside the country &apos;s rigid political system for escalating street violence during the campaign for the May 29 general elections . 
Australian and U.S. embassies advised their citizens living in Jakarta to be watchful for the possibility of more violence , citing widespread clashes in the capital and elsewhere on the country &apos;s main Java island over the last four days . 
Lieutenant-General Syarwan Hamid , head of the socio-political section of Indonesia &apos;s powerful and politicised military , was quoted by the official Antara news agency on Wednesday as blaming the illegal left-wing People &apos;s Democratic Party ( PRD ) for the campaign disturbances . 
&quot; I have come to the conclusion we must suspect the PRD as being behind the acts of violence , &quot; Hamid told a closed-door meeting of media editors on Tuesday . 
&quot; The phenomena and indications of the PRD &apos;s involvement in the riots are there , &quot; he said , a reference to a number of leaflets found at campaign rallies advocating replacing the government and current political laws , including those which give the military a powerful role in internal affairs . 
Indonesia allows only three political parties -- the ruling Golkar , the Moslem-based United Development Party ( PPP ) and the Christian-Nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party ( PDI ) -- to contest elections . 
all of them are required to swear to abide by state ideology and refrain from open criticism of the government and the political system . 
Hamid had also blamed the PRD for riots which broke out in Jakarta in July last year after PDI chief Megawati Sukarnoputri , the charismatic daughter of late founding president Sukarno , was ousted by a government-backed faction . 
twelve of its seniormost leaders have been sentenced to up to 13 years in prison . 
most of the violence since the start of the campaign has stemmed from clashes between supporters of the PPP and Golkar . 
the PPP , whose ranks have been swelled by a growing informal alliance between its supporters and those of Megawati , has also clashed several times with security forces . 
the Republika newspaper reported on Wednesday that 20-year-old Adam Khaeruddin was shot while watching disturbances in the Warung Buncit area of south Jakarta on Tuesday . 
the report did not say who fired the fatal shot , although witnesses said both police and troops fired into the air to disperse a crowd of a few thousand PPP supporters . 
neither hospitals nor police were immediately available for comment . 
the government has not acknowledged any deaths in the violence , although Hamid was quoted by the Kompas daily on Wednesday as saying 110 people had died in accidents during the campaign . 
Hamid said 83 people had died in traffic accidents and 27 drowned when their boat sank on the way to a Golkar rally . 
also on Tuesday , a number of areas in the east and the south of Jakarta were hit by street violence as supporters of the PPP and Golkar clashed and security forces forcibly dispersed large crowds blocking major arterial roads . 
a riot broke out in the Central Java town of Pekalongan as thousands of PPP supporters attacked and ransacked a Golkar office , witnesses said . 
Antara reported minor clashes elsewhere on Java on Tuesday , mainly in the towns of Malang , Jember and Surabaya . 
the Jakarta Post said mobs pelted stones and clashed with security forces in Bandung in West Java as well as Semarang and Pekalongan in Central Java . 
the paper said 150 PPP supporters were detained in Semarang after attacking police on their way home from a rally .
