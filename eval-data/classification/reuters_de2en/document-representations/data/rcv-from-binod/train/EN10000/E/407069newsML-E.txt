a U.S. economist advising the Bulgarian government said on Thursday the battered economy could stabilise with less stringent measures than a fixed exchange rate system . 
&quot; It ( a currency board ) is a very drastic course and I am not absolutely convinced myself that Bulgaria has to go all the way on that drastic course , &quot; economist Jeffrey Sachs said in an interview with Reuters Financial Televsion . 
Sachs , director of the Harvard Institute of Development , has helped governments such as Russia and Poland get on the road to economic reform and is now on his way to Bulgaria , where he has been appointed to an economic council advising President Petar Stoyanov . 
the interview coincided with an International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) mission in Sofia , which started talks with the interim cabinet on a new funding agreement aimed to help the country stabilise its crumbling economy and repay foreign debts . 
Bulgaria &apos;s interim government , in power until after general elections on April 19 , may reach a preliminary funding agreement with the IMF , Finance Minister Svetoslav Gavriiski said on Tuesday . 
&quot; The IMF is pushing hard for a currency board right now . 
as an economic advisor to the government starting soon I am going to be taking a look at that particular proposal . 
I think that needs a very serious look because there are less drastic remedies that will be better for Bulgaria , &quot; said Sachs . 
the IMF is expected to set up arrangements for a currency board system , proposed last year to halt the slump of the Lev currency and restore confidence in the financial system . 
the currency board would require levs in circulation to be matched by central bank reserves , severely curbing the financial powers of the government and the central bank , thus preventing the printing of money . 
the programme , due to be completed by the end of next week , will also contain amendments to bank laws designed jointly with the IMF to permit the introduction of the currency board . 
Bulgaria , which relies solely on external support to repay $ 1 billion debts due this year alone , stands to win more funding from other lenders like the European Union and the World Bank , once an IMF deal is in place . 
foreign investors have said they would feel more secure in the environment of a strict currency board system , which could guarantee more transparency and would prevent asset stripping of state factories and banks , local economists said . 
&quot; Several international investment banks have said they are prepared to provide bridge loans once a strict currency board mechanism is in place , &quot; said Krassen Stanchev , director of an independent think tank , the Institute for Market Economics . 
&quot; I think the currency board is a possible option , it has strengths but it also has weaknesses , &quot; said Sachs , adding that he expected galloping inflation to subside within months . 
economists see February inflation at around 100 percent and monthly inflation for January 1 to 25 was 44 percent . 
&quot; A currency board has many varieties as far as its mechanism and funding sources are concerned ... these have yet to be finalised , &quot; said a member of the interim cabinet , who declined to be named .
