they say an army marches on its stomach . 
the Irish Republican Army has marched for generations on a diet of hatred of Britain &apos;s lingering rule in a corner of the island of Ireland . 
the IRA that called Saturday &apos;s ceasefire is the the successor of a turn-of-century underground army formed to drive Britain off the island . 
its correct title is the Provisional IRA , a name it took in 1970 when it broke from the mainstream organisation to spearhead a war against &quot; the occupying army &quot; in what Britain calls Ulster and the IRA calls &quot; an illegal statelet &quot; . 
the size of its membership is unknown . 
security analysts say it probably has no more than a couple of hundred &quot; volunteers &quot; who will pull triggers or switch the timers of the bombs it has used to tear apart targets and lives in the province and on the British mainland . 
but its aims - an end to British rule and reunification with Ireland - have won it increasing support from the 40 percent Roman Catholic minority in Northern Ireland which says it is treated as second class citizens because of its faith and political aspirations . 
from a 10 percent vote at local elections only seven years ago , Sinn Fein won 16 percent of the Northern Irish vote in Britain &apos;s May 1 general election and returned party president Gerry Adams and his chief negotiatior , Martin McGuinness to the British parliament . 
neither man has taken up his seat . 
the IRA , or &quot; Provos &quot; as they are known , came into being in the 1970s civil rights disturbance that heralded the start of the three-decade conflict that became known as &quot; The Troubles &quot; and which has left 3,200 dead and made the province a fortress . 
it cast itself first and foremost as a defender of Catholic enclaves against marauding Protestant rioters in the 1970s civil rights upheaval . 
then it turned on the offensive . 
as Sinn Fein has grown as a political party , the IRA has lobbed home-made mortar bombs into number 10 Downing Street , official London residence of the British prime Minister , London &apos;s Heathrow airport , one of the world &apos;s busiest , and shot , bombed and killed hundreds of people . 
it has forced Britain to guard the province with up to 20,000 troops and turned every Nothern Ireland high street into a fortress with police stations hidden behind armoured iron sheeting and grilles to fend off mortar bombs and rockets . 
hundreds of IRA activists languish in British jails , caught in crackdowns by a sophisticated British army and intelligence service and Northern Ireland &apos;s own police force . 
but , as security chiefs concede , it is an impossible foe to beat . 
&quot; It &apos;s like a starfish . 
cut off one bit and it just grows again , &quot; one British security source said recently . 
the Northern Ireland peace process , an Anglo-Irish attempt to juggle the sectarian arithmetic and create a new &quot; agreed Ireland &quot; free of guerrilla strife has been hostage to the IRA . 
it was launched in December 1993 with the Anglo-Irish Downing Street Declaration which said that Britain would not block an end to British rule if a majority wanted it and offered Sinn Fein a seat at peace talks if violence ended . 
it did when the guerrillas called a ceasefire in late August , 1994 , but Britain &apos;s insistence that the IRA hand over arms to prove its commitment to democracy led to months of wrangling and Sinn Fein &apos;s exclusion from the negotiations . 
the IRA went back to war in February , 1996 , setting off a huge bomb in London &apos;s Docklands commercial and residential district in the east end , killing two people.Then it bombed Manchester city centre and a British army base in Germany and , in October last year , Britain &apos;s Northern Ireland army headquarters . 
the rules have now changed . 
&quot; Decommissioning &quot; - the surrender of arms , will take place in parallel with the political talks that Sinn Fein can join in six weeks . 
the arms are held in safe houses by IRA quartermasters who only hand them out to &quot; volunteers &quot; when a shadowy Army Council , the group &apos;s top body , authorises an offensive . 
the poor West Belfast suburbs and the Bogside area of Londonderry , a sprawling , ugly housing estate where unemployment is the norm , are fertile recruiting grounds for young men and women who blame London for their plight . 
but the IRA recruiting net spreads wide and takes in the &quot; tough &quot; areas of Dublin and the smoky Irish bars of London &apos;s Irish districts such as Kilburn . 
the IRA &apos;s strength , security analysts say , is an oral history steeped in anti-British hatred . 
every IRA death is an anniversary and celebrated with graveside orations and rhetoric . 
wayward members , informers or opponents are beaten with baseball bats or shot through the knees in &quot; punishment beatings &quot; . 
some are just killed . 
its structure is cell-like with similarites to the Algerian FNLA insurgents or Peru &apos;s Shining Path guerrillas . 
its motto , in the Irish language Britain tried to suppress to stifle nationalism is &quot; Tiocfhaidh ar La . 
it means : &quot; Our day wil come .
