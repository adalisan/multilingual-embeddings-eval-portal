a man screaming about devil worshippers rammed his jeep up several flights of stairs leading into the Canadian parliament on Friday before he stopped and was overcome by police . 
police said the man gunned his jeep past the centennial Flame at the entrance to the parliamentary grounds up a paved walkway and up to the front door of Parliament &apos;s main building . 
he narrowly missed a worker sweeping up cigarettes . 
the driver jumped out of his Quebec vehicle and stormed into the lobby of Parliament , shouting and thrashing about . 
it took several minutes and 20 to 30 security officers to overpower him , said a politician who had been at the door . 
&quot; He was like a wild tiger . 
his legs were going , kicking the police in the stomach and everywhere . 
finally they put a plastic band around his legs , &quot; said Member of Parliament Eugene Bellemare , who had been waiting for a couple school groups . 
&quot; The yelling was infernal , &quot; he said . 
he was finally forced into a police car , repeatedly shouting in English , &quot; Devil worshipers , devil worshipers , &quot; then he managed to kick out a window in a back door of the police cruiser . 
&quot; It was as if he had gone berserk , &quot; Bellemare said . 
the blue jeep was stuck inside a covered walkway leading to the center door of the stone parliament building , before finally being hauled off on a flatbed truck . 
rusty chunks from the undercarriage were strewn across the stairs . 
Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps said the incident was likely to cause a security review , possibly to ban general vehicle traffic around Parliament , but other politicians said it would be a pity to put more distance between them and the public .
