Brazilian stocks reversed early losses to close up slightly in mild trade , following the Dow &apos;s rise on falling U.S. interest rates and speculation over oil prices stemming from turmoil in Iraq , brokers said . 
&quot; Our market is still very closely linked to overseas , &quot; one trader said . 
the Sao Paulo bourse &apos;s Bovespa index of 49 most traded shares rose 375 points to end at 62,700 points , up 0.60 percent on trade totalling 345.7 million reais . 
brokers said Brazilian shares started the day downward on gloom due to a hike in U.S interest rates and worries of war in Iraq . 
but prices , tracking the Dow Jones , did an about-face late in the morning as interest rates began declining and world oil prices were hit by speculation , they said . 
the rise in the Bovespa , which extended trade by a half hour due to technical problems in updating quotes , was led by benchmark Telebras , whose shares and options comprised 72 percent of total volume . 
Telebras preferred ended 0.53 percent higher at 75.80 reais and its common closed up 0.51 percent at 61.50 reais . 
most other blue chips also ended higher in the rollercoaster session , albeit on thin trade . 
Brazil &apos;s state oil monopoly Petrobras , which recently resatarted purchases of Iraqi crude , ended the day a slight 0.41 percent higher at 120.00 reais . 
State mining giant Vale do Rio Doce climbed 1.55 percent to 19.65 reais . 
the Bolsa &apos;s Electrical Energy Index of nine most-liquid shares rose 1.83 percent to 1,573 points . 
power firm Eletrobras moved up 0.72 percent to 281.00 reais .
