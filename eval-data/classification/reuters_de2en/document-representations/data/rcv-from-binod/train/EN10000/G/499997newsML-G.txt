a protein called Nurr1 may play a key role in Parkinson &apos;s disease and could help researchers find new therapies , scientists said on Thursday . 
while an embryo develops , Nurr1 plays a role in forming the brain cells that make dopamine , a neurotransmitter . 
later in life it appears to keep those dopamine cells active . 
Parkinson &apos;s patients lack dopamine and gradually develop tremors and motor difficulties . 
drugs slow the process in some patients but do not cure it . 
the research , appearing in the journal Science on Friday , suggests that a defect in Nurr1 may be part of the problem and the protein may also be a target for future drug development . 
Nurr1 was discovered in 1992 but the new work by Thomas Perlmann of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and Lars Olson of the Karolinska Institute , both in Stockholm , sheds light on what it does . 
the researchers developed mouse models that lacked one or both Nurr1 genes . 
mice who lacked the gene completely did not suckle and died a day or two after birth . 
cells in the mid-brain were poorly organised and had never formed specialised neurons to make dopamine . 
&quot; That cell type is clearly missing , &quot; Perlmann said . 
the mice with one copy of the gene did survive but they produced less dopamine than normal mice . 
although more research is needed , the results so far suggest that the mice make less dopamine but do not have fewer of those cells . 
scientists hope that by learning more about this protein they will be able to develop better treatments .
