Central bank president Wim Duisenberg said on Tuesday the &quot; Dutch miracle &quot; of sustained job growth in combination with a steady reduction in the budget deficit was a product of the country &apos;s consensus economics . 
&quot; Whereas in the early 1980s the &quot; Dutch disease &quot; was a household word , more recently &apos; le miracle hollandais &apos; is being praised , &quot; he said in a preface to the bank &apos;s 1996 annual report . 
while France and Germany are struggling to get their budget deficits below three percent of GDP this year to qualify for monetary union , the Dutch deficit is estimated at 2.3 percent . 
Duisenberg also contrasted Dutch unemployment of just over six percent with French and German rates almost twice as high . 
in the early 1980s , however , the Netherlands faced a soaring budget deficit , rising unemployment , a contraction of gross domestic product and a sharp decline in disposable incomes . 
&quot; Small wonder then that the government , the employers &apos; organisations and trade unions came to the conclusion that the situation should not be allowed to continue , &quot; Duisenberg said . 
broad agreement was reached -- and is still largely intact -- on restoring public finances and company profits , keeping wage rises in check and making the labour market more flexible . 
Duisenberg said the Netherlands had been forced to tackle its deficit -- which peaked at almost 10 percent of GDP -- much earlier than other countries . 
the decision to lock the guilder into a tight exchange rate against the German mark had also been positive for the Netherlands &apos; economy and its public finances , he said . 
Duisenberg warned against complacency , however , urging the country to resist the temptation of abandoning the twin virtues of wage moderation and strict control over public finances . 
in July he is due to take over as head of the European Monetary Institute and he is also regarded as a strong candidate to become the first president of the European Central Bank which will oversee the launch of the single European currency in 1999 .
