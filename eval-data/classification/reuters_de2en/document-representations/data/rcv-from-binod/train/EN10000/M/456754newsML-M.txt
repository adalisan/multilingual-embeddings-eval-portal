Indian aromatic Basmati rice prices firmed by about $ 200 per tonne in the past week due to a surge in demand from European and Middle East countries and a lower crop forecast , traders said on Thursday . 
&quot; Prices had risen by $ 200 per tonne because of increased demand from Europe and the Middle East countries and lower crop expectation , &quot; said Prem Garg , managing director of Sri Lal Mahal Overseas Ltd , a leading Delhi foodgrains exporter . 
&quot; Basmati prices are high as international demand is more and there is a shortfall in the crop , &quot; said Deepak Tanna , a leading Bombay foodgrains exporter . 
traders said Basmati was currently quoted at around $ 1,200 per tonne fob compared with $ 1,000 a week earlier . 
Tanna said the 1996 / 97 ( July / June ) Basmati crop was expected to be less than the previous year but did not say by how much . 
India produced a little more than 600,000 tonnes of Basmati in 1995 / 96 . 
traders said export demand for Indian non-Basmati rice was dull as it was quoted about $ 20- $ 30 per tonne higher than that of similar grades from Pakistan and Vietnam . 
&quot; The ( export ) demand is not very much there , &quot; Tanna said . 
Garg said : &quot; Some parboiled rice and five percent broken grades are going to South Africa and the Middle East . 
traders said Indian five percent broken non-Basmati rice was quoted at $ 300 per tonne fob , 10 percent at $ 280-285 , 15 percent at $ 250-255 and 25 percent at $ 235-240 per tonne .
