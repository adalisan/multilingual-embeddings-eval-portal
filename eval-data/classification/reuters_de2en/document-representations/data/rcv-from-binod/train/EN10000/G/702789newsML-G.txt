Britain &apos;s drought has not ended , despite the wettest June this century , according to the Environment Agency . 
although June &apos;s rainfall has been useful in cutting the need for irrigation and watering of gardens , the rainfall is not reaching aquifers , where levels remain low , the agency said , in a statement . 
environment agency records for the Anglia region show that 125 millimetres of rain fell in June , compared with a long term average of 51 millimetres . 
but around 40 per cent of the population in the region are reliant on groundwater supplies , which still stand at the lowest on record in many areas , the agency said .
