a Shi &apos;ite Moslem militia sent reinforcements on Sunday to block fresh advances by Afghanistan &apos;s Taleban militia , travellers said . 
they said Karim Khalili , leader of the Shi &apos;ite Hezb-i-Wahdat faction , was trying to build a new defensive line at Qatar Khak to prevent the Taleban from moving towards Bamiyan , a Shi &apos;ite stronghold in central Afghanistan . 
the Taleban have been advancing through the strategic Ghorband Valley in the past few days in their latest offensive against an opposition alliance that includes Hezb-i-Wahdat . 
the valley leads westward from Jabal os-Siraj , 70 km ( 44 miles ) north of Kabul , towards Bamiyan , whose capture would allow the Taleban to open a new front against northern General Abdul Rashid Dostum , also part of the anti-Taleban coalition . 
Dostum is already defending his northern heartland against Taleban forces pushing up the Salang Highway north of Kabul and fighting in the northwestern province of Badghis . 
villagers said the Taleban advance had been eased by the defection of a former government commander and his 50 fighters . 
the Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press said the Taleban had captured the Shekali district of Parwan province , 80 km ( 50 miles ) northwest of Kabul , from the Hezb-i-Wahdat on Sunday . 
it said Taleban warriors , adherents of rival Sunni Islam , also captured the district of Sorkhi Parsa in the same province on Saturday with little resistance from the Shi &apos;ite militia . 
the agency said Taleban forces were now advancing towards Shobar , on the border of Bamiyan province . 
the Taleban &apos;s Voice of Shariat radio said on Saturday that people in the Shi &apos;ite-populated districts of Tagab and Behsoud , in Wardak province west of Kabul , had revolted against Khalili . 
&quot; People of Behsoud and Tagab have risen against Khalili &apos;s militia and tens of his fighters have been disarmed , &quot; it said . 
Behsoud is about 225 km ( 140 miles ) west of Kabul and 60 km ( 40 miles ) south of Bamiyan . 
there was no independent confirmation of the Voice of Shariat report . 
the Taleban now appear to be threatening Bamiyan from three directions -- Ghor to the west , Wardak to the south and the Ghorband Valley to the east . 
&quot; If news of an uprising by people who are themselves Shi &apos;ites is true , then the Taleban have a good chance of seizing Bamiyan , &quot; a military analyst said . 
the Taleban , who seized Kabul from the former government led by president Burhanuddin Rabbani in September , want to spread their strict version of Islam across Afghanistan .
