Indonesian tyre-grade SIR20 offer prices were stable in late trading on Thursday on the back of low consumer demand due to wintering in the U.S. and Europe . 
dealers said March SIR20 offer prices were stable 53.25 U.S. cents / lb fob Medan and at 53.00 fob Padang and Surabaya . 
&quot; The market is still quiet as usual . 
but I heard a deal was done at 53.00 U.S. cents / lb in Palembang , &quot; said one dealer . 
they said winter in the U.S. and Europe , which usually sees a slowdown in demand for tyre , had affected the local market . 
dealers earlier said it would be hard for rubber to reach the 53.50 U.S. cents / lb level because of the low demand .
