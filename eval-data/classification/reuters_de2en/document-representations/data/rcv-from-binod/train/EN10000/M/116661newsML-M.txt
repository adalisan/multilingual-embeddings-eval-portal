the Prague bourse continued its sustained downtrend on Tuesday , with the PX50 &apos;s most heavily weighted share , SPT Telecom , leading the index 3.1 points lower to 535.3 . 
dealers said the Czech market &apos;s poor performance , especially in the context of relatively strong showings in comparable countries in the region , was caused by the much lamented failure of the authorities to provide a firm regulatory framework for the capital markets . 
&quot; This is the price we have to pay for the lack of transparency , &quot; said Jan Sykora of Wood &amp; Company . 
Sykora said that the fate of SPT Telecom , which lost 63 crowns to 3,090 was typical of the way in which the inadequacies of the market were adversly affecting good companies . 
&quot; fundamentally , SPT is still one of the best companies in the Czech Republic ... the problem is that I don &apos;t see any foreign assets moving in here , &quot; he said . 
elsewhere on the PX50 index , the heavyweight banking stocks , Komercni Banka and Ceska Sporitelna both moved higher . 
dealers say the big banks are benefiting from depositors moving their funds from small banks into the relative safety of the dominant Czech financial institutions . 
Sporitelna rose six crowns to 330 and Komercni gained one crown to 2,220 .
