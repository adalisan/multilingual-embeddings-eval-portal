world record signing Alan Shearer &apos;s groin operation has been hailed &quot; a complete success &quot; and Newcastle are hoping the England skipper might not be sidelined for as long as they first feared . 
Shearer had the operation in London on Thursday and , after staying in hospital overnight , he returned home on Friday . 
it was thought that the striker , who moved from Blackburn to Newcastle for a world record fee of 15.0 million pounds ( $ 24 million ) in the close-season , would be out of action for six to eight weeks -- ruling him out of England &apos;s World Cup date in Georgia on November 9 . 
but a Newcastle spokesman said : &quot; Fingers crossed , the six to eight weeks we suggested might be longer than it takes for him to recover . 
&quot; The operation has been a complete success and Alan has recovered from it without any problems . 
&quot; He is now resting at home and he will decide when he is ready to start training again . 
Shearer underwent a similar operation at the end of last season to ensure his fitness for England &apos;s Euro 96 campaign .
