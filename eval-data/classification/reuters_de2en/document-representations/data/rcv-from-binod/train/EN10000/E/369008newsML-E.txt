world Bank President James Wolfensohn told Ghana &apos;s newly elected parliament on Tuesday that inflation was the number one enemy of the people and had to be curbed . 
Wolfensohn , who arrived in Ghana from Senegal on Monday on the second leg of a nine-day Africa tour , acknowledged that the West African nation had a difficult job balancing the fight against poverty with a need for economic belt-tightening . 
&quot; It is quite hard to have a strong macro-economic plan when there are social demands and poverty is rife in the country but a macro-economic plan which is sound is really an essential pre-requisite to development , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Inflation is the worst enemy of the people . 
what you need to do is to have and implement is a rigourous programme which yields with that as well as with other sectors of your economy , &quot; he said . 
inflation in Ghana , once dubbed a model pupil by the Bank , fell from 70 percent to 35 percent in the year to December 1996 but the World Bank and independent economists say this may not prove sustainable . 
Wolfensohn , who has stressed the importance of Ghana to the Bank &apos;s activities , highlighted a need to develop education , infrastructure and farming and the role of the private sector . 
Wolfensohn will hold talks with President Jerry Rawlings , who won a second and final elected term in December . 
the Bank president leaves for South Africa and Mozambique on Wednesday .
