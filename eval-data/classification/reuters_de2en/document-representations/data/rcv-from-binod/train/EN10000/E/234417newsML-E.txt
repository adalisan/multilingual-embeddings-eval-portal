a judge in California has ruled that legislation that helped cash-strapped Los Angeles County balance its budget violated the state &apos;s Constitution , prompting some concern Wednesday among credit analysts . 
the ruling also attracted the attention of Orange County &apos;s attorneys and advisers because similar legislation helped Orange County emerge from bankruptcy earlier this year . 
Wednesday , the attorney who filed the Los Angeles suit said he may now file a similar action against Orange County . 
the 1995 fiscal relief legislation authorized the transfer of $ 50 million of Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority sales tax funds to the county . 
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Richard Hubbell ruled , however , that the legislation that allowed Los Angeles County to take the money violated a provision of the state Constitution that prohibits special statutes for the benefit of a county or city . 
the ruling was made public Tuesday . 
rating agency officials expressed some concerns Wednesday and said they would review the decision closely . 
&quot; We &apos;ll certainly look into this , &quot; said Moody &apos;s Investors Service Inc vice president Ken Kurtz . 
&quot; It &apos;s a significant amount of money , but it &apos;s not a disastrous amount . 
&quot; We &apos;ll be interested in the ruling when we see it , &quot; said Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s Corp director David Hitchcock . 
&quot; We look at everything that seems significant . 
the decision was a setback for Los Angeles County , which sought the transit funds during its budget crisis last year , county officials said . 
county attorneys said , however , that the trial court &apos;s action would be stayed pending an appeal . 
&quot; We &apos;ll see them on appeal , &quot; said Zev Yaroslavsky , chairman of Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors . 
&quot; Until the appeals are resolved , we have no intention of addressing the pay back issue . 
Yaroslavsky added , &quot; The money has been spent already . 
if it ( the ruling ) holds , it would have draconian implications for Los Angeles and Orange County . 
Hubbell &apos;s decision came out of a trial that took place in late November in response to a taxpayer lawsuit filed by Los Angeles attorney Richard Fine . 
the lawsuit sought the return of the taxpayer money to the transportation authority . 
&quot; We &apos;ve won a number of similar cases , and in each case the court &apos;s decision has sent a message to our politicians : you can &apos;t continue to spend taxpayers &apos; money to bail out a government when those responsible for its fiscal health fail in their responsibilities , &quot; Fine said . 
fine added he may now challenge the Orange County legislation on similar grounds . 
&quot; We &apos;re reviewing the Orange County legislation right now , &quot; Fine said . 
&quot; It &apos;s similar ( to the Los Angeles County legislation ) in the sense that it states that it is special legislation to relieve the fiscal crisis in Orange County . 
we &apos;ll make our decision in the next couple of days . 
he said Orange County should never have sought this type of legislation , which diverts transit and other funds to help repay county bondholders . 
&quot; They never should have put this type of legislation into their bankruptcy plan , &quot; Fine said . 
&quot; If it forces them into bankruptcy ( again ) , it is a problem they will have to face because they knew at the time that they passed this legislation that it could be unconstitutional .
