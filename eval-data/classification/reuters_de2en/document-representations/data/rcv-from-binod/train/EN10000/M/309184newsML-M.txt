Swiss bonds turned weaker after a strong start which took the March confederate bond futures to a new contract high of 117.30 , up 30 basis points . 
the contract slipped however to end down nine at 116.91 . 
traders saw demand from institutional investors who were mainly keen to buy longer-dated paper offering comparatively high yields after the Swiss market &apos;s latest rally . 
some traders also said Swiss bonds were closely following the direction of German Bunds . 
Bunds were below highs after news that Germany revised up its 1996 federal budget deficit . 
German bonds were also down as U.S. bond prices fell . 
&quot; At the moment , Switzerland &apos;s bond market is moving more in line with German bonds , &quot; one Swiss trader said . 
meanwhile , Winterthur Insurance said Wednesday it would launch a 300 million Swiss franc convertible bond whose performance is linked to compensation for weather-related vehicle damage . 
interest payments will depend upon whether Winterthur has to compensate 6,000 or more vehicles it insures in Switzerland for or hail or storm damage within a specified period . 
Winterthur said it will be the first public offering of a catastrophe-linked bond . 
launch of the bond , with a 2-1 / 4 percent coupon , is expected on Thursday .
