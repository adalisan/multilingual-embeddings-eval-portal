a strong performance in asset management should give British investment bank Schroders &apos; 1996 an additional boost , analysts said on Friday . 
&quot; Asset management ought to have done very well , &quot; a banking analyst at one U.S. investment bank told Reuters . 
the consensus forecast for Schroders &apos; 1996 pre-tax profit is 234.0 million stg , with a range of 230-240 million stg , compared with a pre-tax profit of 197 million stg in 1995 . 
analysts canvassed by Reuters expect a dividend of between 18.5 and 19.0 pence per share when the bank reports on Wednesday . 
last September , in its half-year results , Schroders reported pre-tax profits of 115.9 million stg , compared with 85.6 million stg for the same period the previous year . 
analysts said a warning the group might not be able to sustain successive increases in profits should have been overcome by the asset management performance in the months since . 
&quot; The asset management side has done very well . 
there has been a lot of publicity about mandates they have won , &quot; said one . 
but Schroders &apos; investment banking side is not expected to provide such sparkling results as the group shoulders increased costs in the area , the result of a five-year strategy to build Schroders &apos; global business . 
and since this was announced last year , there had been further consolidation in the industry , putting even greater pressure on the firm to perform . 
&quot; There must be questions over whether it is a worthwhile strategy , &quot; the second analyst said , adding that investment banking costs could in fact hold back future profits . 
this is despite good performances both in the securities business and Schroders &apos; mergers and acquisitions advisory work . 
recurring suggestions that Schroders might be a takeover target overlooked the fact that the Schroder family , which along with the firm &apos;s staff effectively controls more than 50 percent of the company , wants it to remain independent . 
&quot; It would have to be an agreed takeover and obviously you ( the bidder ) would have to be bringing something to the party , &quot; the second analyst added . 
&quot; When they feel the time is right , they might do it , &quot; he said .
