LIFFE September gilt futures will continue within their broad 114-00 , 116-00 range on Thursday but with some downside bias , technical analysts said . 
fundamentals will also play a part with the result of the Bank of England monetary policy committee &apos;s regular meeting to decide interest rates due at 1100 GMT . 
&quot; If we do get a rate rise we will probably test the lower levels 114-04 , 114-05 and if that area breaks then we could go down to the key 113-24 level , &quot; said Marc Ostwald , technical analyst at London Bond Broking here . 
the contract reached 113-24 just after the budget and that was likely to be the bottom of the market for now , Ostwald said . 
&quot; gilts are trying to consolidate at the lower levels we have reached over the last two days . 
we are basically trading in a broad 114-00 , 116-00 range , &quot; he said . 
but Ostwald said there might be the opportunity to move higher and re-visit recent highs in the 114-25 , 28 area . 
&quot; If we are going to start negating the negative trend we have got to get over that area , &quot; he said . 
above there he said further resistance was offered by the previous congestion area around 115-05,07 . 
&quot; Those two regions could prove quite substantial hurdles for today , but if we can break those levels then in the longer run we could break back towards 115-24 , &quot; Ostwald said . 
technical anlaysts at a European bank in London said gilts could see some further recovery but not above 116-00 for now . 
&quot; The market is relatively firm and we &apos;d look for further recovery of at least half a point , &quot; they said in a research note . 
to the downside they saw support at 114-00 , 113-16 , 17 and 113-00 , and said it would have been technically satisfying to see 114-00 broken . 
at the short end , December short sterling was at 92.59 , up four basis points on the day .
