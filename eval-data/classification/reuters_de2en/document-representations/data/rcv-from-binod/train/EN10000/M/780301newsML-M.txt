the New Zealand dollar ended firmer on Tuesday but dealers said one persistent seller prevented the kiwi rising too far on the back of surprisingly strong employment data . 
it had fallen to 0.6426 / 33 shortly before June quarter employment data from Statistics New Zealand at 2245 GMT , taking the Monetary Conditions Index ( MCI ) to 101 basis points easier than the Reserve Bank &apos;s desired level . 
financial markets had expected the jobs data to reinforce the view of a sluggish economy and were taken aback by employment growth rising 0.2 percent in the quarter , against average expectations of a 0.15 percent fall . 
the number of hours worked also grew at a surprisingly strong rate , up 2.5 percent in the quarter . 
the RBNZ had forecast growth of 1.9 percent in hours worked , and several commentators had denounced that projection as too high . 
dealers said the kiwi dollar was initially bought after the data , but then encountered determined selling from one party . 
it scrambled higher once more when the RBNZ reaffirmed to Reuters that it had not changed its policy position at all since it delivered its June Monetary Policy Statement . 
&quot; Again it surged higher but that same seller continued selling all day . 
now we &apos;re pressing higher , and the market is still quite short at the moment , &quot; one Wellington dealer said . 
he expected offshore buying to boost the kiwi further overnight but &quot; not too far &quot; , saying there still seemed to be sellers waiting in the wings . 
&quot; We need some more numbers before we can confirm that the slow down is beginning to turn around , and I think people will continue to tread pretty carefully , &quot; the dealer said . 
meanwhile , short term interest rates managed a one basis point rally to 8.29 percent during the session . 
dealers said while rates remained low there was little chance of the MCI contracting much further , as the market still expects the RBNZ to sanction an easing in conditions on September 18 . 
the kiwi was seen trading a 0.6425-65 range overnight .
