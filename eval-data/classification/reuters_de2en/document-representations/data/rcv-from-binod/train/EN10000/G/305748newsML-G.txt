a nine-year-old girl worked herself into a lather over a soap commercial she charged was muddying the reputation of children and got Israeli television to scrub the spot . 
the Dial soap jingle -- &quot; If you &apos;ve got children , you &apos;ve got germs &quot; -- irritated Shahaf Zilberman so much when she saw it on Israel &apos;s Channel 2 that she wrote a letter of complaint . 
&quot; A commercial must be persuasive to sell itself but a product that makes children into germs isn &apos;t worth buying , &quot; she told Israel Radio on Tuesday . 
&quot; My parents work in medicine and I know what germs are , so that &apos;s what irritated me the most , &quot; the girl said . 
after a couple of weeks , the commercial was changed . 
&quot; No question she raised a point , &quot; said Channel 2 director-general Nachman Shai .
