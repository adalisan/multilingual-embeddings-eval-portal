retail spending in Britain is about to pick up under the new Labour government , thanks to windfall gains from the building society share flotations and an improving &quot; feelgood &quot; factor . 
but don &apos;t expect a boom , retail consultancy Verdict Research , said in a report published on Tuesday . 
&quot; There is a growing mood of optimism at present , &quot; says Verdict in its latest forecast for retailing trends to the year 2001 . 
&quot; The change in government , a recovery in the housing market and the tax cuts from the last budget now working through combine to give a feeling of well being , &quot; it said . 
any tax increases in the forthcoming budget were likely to fall on the corporate sector , not on consumers , and the recent increase in interest rates would be more than offset by windfall gains for millions of consumers from the rash of flotations by mutually-owned building societies and insurance companies . 
consequently , Verdict expected real growth in consumer goods spending of 3.5 percent in 1997 but said growth would ease to 2.9 percent in 1998 . 
&quot; There will not be a spending boom like that of the 1980s , nor will there be a recession such as there was in 1990 or 1980 , &quot; Verdict said . 
instead it predicts growth in spending falling back to 2.0 percent in 1999 , 1.4 percent in the year 2000 before picking up again to 1.6 percent in 2001 . 
it said there would continued to be wide variations in the performance of individual sectors , with electrical goods set to be the star performer . 
spending on computers and accessories is forecast to rise by almost 150 percent over the period while television sales will be boosted by the advent of digital technology and rise by 50 percent . 
in clothing , Verdict predicts adult outerwear sales will grow by 46 percent but says childrens clothing sales will grow by only 27 percent and infantswear will decline by five percent , hit by a fall in new births . 
verdict said there would also be a recovery in furniture and floor covering sales over the next two years , but no boom . 
meanwhile grocery chains would continue to diversify their product ranges in pursuit of profits growth in what is a largely saturated market for basic foodstuffs . 
&quot; Grocers have to cope with a food market which has very little growth potential , &quot; said Verdict . 
&quot; They are doing so , not just by enhancing their convenience ranges , but by merchandising other non-food ranges with ever-growing authority ... increasingly , customers are using the superstore for convenience purchases .
