a group of Jewish settlers were carried away by Israeli forces in Palestinian self-ruled Jericho in the West Bank on Friday after they refused to leave the city , witnesses and the Israeli army said . 
&quot; Eleven Israeli citizens entered Jericho in Palestinian Authority territory against the orders of security forces , &quot; an army spokesman said . 
&quot; The group entered the city without crossing an Israeli army checkpoint and were removed from the city by Israeli soldiers , &quot; the spokesman said . 
witnesses said the group of religious Jews , carrying food , blankets and books , entered a park restaurant in the centre of the Palestinian-ruled city some two km some from an ancient Jericho synagogue and began to pray . 
restaurant owner Jibrin al-Damanhouri said the settlers had entered his establishment posing as tourists . 
&quot; An Israeli professor telephoned me and said a group of French tourists would visit Jericho today and they wanted to eat in my restaurant . 
upon entering the restaurant in the centre of the park , the &quot; tourists &quot; donned Jewish prayer shawls and began conducting prayer services . 
witnesses said Palestinian police called the local joint Israeli-Palestinian security office for assistance after the settlers refused to leave . 
some 25 Israeli soldiers and police who arrived at the scene , escorted by Palestinian police , asked the settlers to leave but were rebuffed . 
the Israeli forces then carried the settlers away kicking and screaming . 
&quot; They ( settlers ) were yelling and shouting in Hebrew when the soldiers pushed them into their vehicles , &quot; a witness said . 
the Israeli army said the group was being held in the Israeli-Palestinian district coordinating office until the end of the Jewish Sabbath on Saturday night . 
the army said it viewed the incident with &quot; severity &quot; . 
Israel withdrew its troops from Jericho and handed the city over to Palestinian self-rule under a 1993 peace deal . 
under the accord , Israelis are allowed to visit the 6th century synagogue in Jericho . 
the synagogue was reopened to Israelis for several hours on Friday morning for the first time since fierce clashes in the West Bank and Gaza killed 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis in September .
