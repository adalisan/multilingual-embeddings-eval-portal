Tokyo stocks sagged after lunch on Friday as unwinding of arbitrage-linked sales set in after the Tokyo bourse &apos;s electronic trading system recovered from a technical hiccup in the morning session , brokers said . 
as of 0404 GMT , the Nikkei average was down 218.32 points or 1.07 percent at 20,113.1 . 
the Nikkei 225 suffered its sixth-largest point drop this year , ending down 527.05 points , or 2.59 percent , at 19,804.38 . 
it was its first close below 20,000 since July 11 , when it ended at 19,875.49 . 
its September futures ended 530 points lower at 19,800 . 
at the end of the morning session , the technical hiccup had sent Nikkei 225 September futures 167 points below the cash index , inviting arbitrage-linked sales . 
&quot; The fall in futures accelerated after the release of glum July domestic car sales data , &quot; Kenji Karikomi , deputy general manager at Daiwa Securities . 
&quot; Investors were discouraged that the economy was not recovering and some switched to bond futures , &quot; he added . 
the Japan Automobile Dealers &apos; Association said domestic vehicle sales fell 10.1 percent in July , declining for the fourth straight month on a year-on-year basis . 
the key September JGB contract set a new contract high of 126.77 . 
&quot; The recent failure of construction firm Tada Corp and the raid on Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd by Tokyo prosecutors had bruised sentiment and the stock market was vulnerable to bad news , &quot; one broker said . 
turnover was 450 million shares , little changed from Thursday , but losers overwhelmed winners 944 to 184 . 
the pebble that sent stocks tumbling was the Tokyo Stock Exchange &apos;s worst-ever technical failure , which hit trade of 1,702 issues , 108 of which are included in the Nikkei average . 
bourse officials apologised for the mishap but said they had yet to ascertain what went wrong . 
&quot; The failure threw everyone off in the morning session and unleashed arbitrage-linked selling after trade resumed , but despite that , some electronic firms were still going strong , &quot; said Mitsuru Hayashino , Sanyo Securities general manager .
