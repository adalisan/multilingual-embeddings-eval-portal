Portuguese futures and short cash maturities firmed but dealers said speculation that France will hold an early general election left 10-year bonds vulnerable to any weakness in other European markets . 
&quot; 10-year bonds are jittery . 
the spread over German Bunds is narrowing and we could see losses today , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; But although the escudo is down , short cash maturities look well supported , &quot; he added . 
dealers said Portugal &apos;s economic fundamentals were lending maturities of up to three years strong support . 
&quot; In April year-on-year comsumer prices will have risen less than two percent which will leave even greater room for the Bank of Porugal to cut key money market rates , &quot; said another trader . 
French franc weakness dragged the escudo lower . 
at 1115 GMT it stood at 100.64 / 67 per mark against Friday &apos;s close of 100.52 / 55 .
