Hizbollah guerrillas killed one Israeli soldier and wounded two on Saturday in the bloodiest attack in south Lebanon in more than two weeks , pro-Israeli Lebanese militia sources said . 
the casualties raised to 24 the number of Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon this year -- one more than 1995 &apos;s total . 
the guerrillas fired machineguns and anti-tank missiles at an Israeli army post at Blat in the western sector of Israel &apos;s south Lebanon occupation zone , hitting a tank and causing the casualties , South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) militia sources said . 
&quot; One of the Sagger missiles scored a direct hit , destroying a tank and killing one soldier and wounding two , &quot; one SLA source said . 
it was the bloodiest attack by pro-Iranian Hizbollah ( Party of God ) fighters against Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon since two soldiers were killed and four wounded when a Hizbollah bomb went off in their patrol in a nightime raid on October 25 . 
the latest assault came on the eve of Hizbollah &apos;s &quot; martyr &apos;s Day &quot; in which the militant group commemorates fallen guerrillas killed in confrontations with Israeli or SLA forces . 
in retaliation for Saturday &apos;s attack , Israeli forces opened up with 120-mm and 155-mm artillery onto the outskirts of four Shi &apos;ite villages where Moslem guerrillas are active just north of the western flank of the Israeli-held border strip . 
there was no immediate word on any casualties in the retaliatory bombardment . 
in Beirut , Hizbollah said in a statement that its guerrillas rained down anti-tank rockets and machinegun fire at Blat post , destroying a Mirkava tank and &quot; killing and wounding a number of soldiers . 
the group said that nearly two hours after the first assault its snippers hit an SLA militiaman at Alman post in a different sector of the zone . 
there was no immediate independent confirmation of the report . 
Hizbollah , which is financed and armed by Iran , leads an Islamic Resistance movement dedicated to ousting Israeli and SLA forces from the 15-km ( nine-mile ) deep zone . 
the fundamentalist group is vehemently opposed to Arab-Israeli peace negotiations . 
some 1,000 Israeli troops and the 3,000-strong client SLA patrol the zone extending from Mount Hermon in the east to the Mediterranean westwards -- set up in 1985 to deter cross-border guerrilla raids on northern Israeli settlements . 
Israel launched a massive 17-day military operation against Hizbollah in Lebanon in April which killed 200 people , mostly civilians . 
a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement ended the Israeli bombardment and Hizbollah rocket attacks on Israel . 
the ceasefire agreement bars Hizbollah and the Israelis from launching attacks against or from civilian areas but allows guerrilla raids on Israeli troops in south Lebanon and gives both sides the right of self-defence .
