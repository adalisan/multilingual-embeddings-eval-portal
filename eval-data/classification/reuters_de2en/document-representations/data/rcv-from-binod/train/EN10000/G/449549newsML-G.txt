U.S. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton played teacher to Zulu-speaking schoolchildren in the sprawling Soweto township outside Johannesburg on Tuesday , the first day of her three-day visit of South Africa . 
Mrs. Clinton was greeted by hundreds of cheering women and children who lined the street as her motorcade pulled to a stop in Soweto at a series of low buildings surrounded by a fence topped with razor wire . 
this was the Entandweni Lower Primary School , one of the oldest schools in Soweto , teaching about 760 pupils aged six to 13 . 
it uses interactive radio programmes to help learning and has received some American assistance . 
inside Mrs. Clinton took on the role of teacher to children sitting at small desks learning to speak English . 
&quot; Can you say , &apos; that &apos;s a monkey , ? 
&apos; &quot; Mrs. Clinton asked the group of first grade boys and girls , teaching them to match words to pictures in their books . 
they responded in unison : &quot; That &apos;s a monkey &quot; . 
when she asked them to point to things outside the classroom , to teach them the use of the word outside , one little girl raised her hand and said : &quot; The policemen are outside the buildings . 
&quot; Goodbye , goodbye , it &apos;s time for us to go , &quot; the children sang as Mrs. Clinton , wearing a bright pink dress and gold hairband , and her 17-year-old daughter Chelsea left the class . 
the school population gathered in the courtyard and sang the South African national anthem to their departing visitors . 
at a roundtable with school principal primrose Sishi and deputy South African education minister Smangaliso Mkhatshwa , Mrs. Clinton stressed education should be emphasised as a way of improving democracy . 
&quot; It is difficult if not impossible to sustain and grow democracy without education , &quot; she said . 
next , she was scheduled to lay a wreath at the hector Peterson Memorial commemorating the anti-apartheid struggle , tour the Orlando Children &apos;s Home and join prominent women for discussions on crime and domestic violence . 
a main theme of Mrs. Clinton &apos;s two-week goodwill tour of six African nations is to promote better health and education for women and children . 
on arrival in Johanneburg from the West African nation of Senegal , President Bill Clinton &apos;s wife said South Africa still faced many challenges in the post-apartheid period but the United States was committed to helping . 
&quot; South Africa still faces many challenges -- housing , health care , education , job creation and crime are all concerns here -- just as they are around the world , &quot; she said . 
&quot; America remains firmly committed to working with South Africa to address these issues . 
Mrs. Clinton travels to Cape Town on Wednesday where she is to join Mandela and American actor Bill Cosby for a benefit at Robben Island , where Mandela spent 18 of his 27 years in jail as a political prisoner . 
she will also speak at the University of Cape Town and attend , with Archbishop Desmond Tutu , a meeting of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission dedicated to resolving apartheid-era crimes . 
Mrs. Clinton , on her ninth solo trip outside the United States and the first sitting U.S. first lady to make a goodwill mission to Africa , is also to visit Zimbabwe , Tanzania , Uganda and Eritrea before returning to Washington on March 30 .
