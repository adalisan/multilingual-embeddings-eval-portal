Asian stocks are expected to linger in the doldrums in the coming week with the notable exception of Hong Kong , which most traders expect to power ahead after hitting a fresh all-time high last week . 
&quot; You really have to stay with Hong Kong for a while , especially now that sentiment has changed in the United States from repeated rate increases , &quot; said David Descalzi , senior portfolio manager at prudential Asia . 
recent economic data relaxing fears of further U.S. rate hikes have focussed attention on the economic fundamentals in Hong Kong , which are considered strong thanks to its increasing integration into the Chinese economy , he said . 
Manila could also dish up some positive surprises in the next few trading sessions after a massive sell-off that some investors consider overdone , he said . 
the Thai analogy is way overblown , &quot; he said , referring to comparisons between the two nations &apos; property and banking sectors . 
Thailand is considered to have reached its bottom after last week &apos;s sudden slide , but the jury is still out on when the market will turn around . 
further concrete signs of economic improvement are required before the market can gain any convincing upward momentum , although the recent U.S. dollar weakness against the yen will provide some support , he said . 
Indonesia &apos;s recent strength was considered a result of an absence of bad news in its election campaign -- &quot; there hasn &apos;t been too much violence &quot; -- rather than an expression of optimism on economic fundamentals , although other fund managers said the economic picture in Indonesia is improving . 
Hong Kong - Hong Kong stocks will need heavy volumes to continue in order to maintain current levels at record highs , brokers said . 
&quot; Volume will be very important , &quot; said Sam Lok , dealing director at Core Pacific Securities . 
&quot; If we see Hongkong Telecom attracting strong buying , that could support the index above 14,000 . 
the Hang Seng Index ended Friday 190.50 points , or 1.39 percent , higher at a record close of 13,930.80 , after setting an all-time high of 14,047.20 . 
over the week , the index gained 849.10 points , or 6.49 percent . 
Tokyo - Tokyo shares are poised to extend the correction that started on Friday , brokers said . 
the extent and length of the correction would depend greatly on external factors , they added . 
wall Street &apos;s performance as well as yen / dollar rates held the possibility of sending the Tokyo benchmark down sharply . 
&quot; Stocks have been rising recently on excessive buying by pension funds , &quot; said Noboru Yorita , Tachibana Securities general manager . 
&quot; If something happens to stall the buying , the Nikkei average could soften to the 19,500 level . 
the 225-share Nikkei average had risen about 10 percent in the new business year started April 1 . 
but it slipped 259.03 points or 1.29 percent to end at 19,802.78 on Friday , closing below the 20,000 threshold for the first time that week . 
the yen &apos;s rise against the dollar to above the 123 yen level on Friday , the first time it had reached that level in about a month , brought on profit-taking of blue-chip export-oriented shares . 
Taipei - Taiwan share prices are expected to continue a consolidation next week amid jitters over political uncertainty , brokers said . 
the administration , which has faced intense criticism over a spate of violent crime , was expected to announce a reshuffle next Wednesday . 
&quot; If the reshuffle does not meet the public expectations , we can expect more selling by disappointed investors , &quot; George Hou , a fund manager of Jardine Fleming , said . 
&quot; The market will stay in a consolidation as long as the political situation remains unclear , &quot; he added . 
on Saturday , the index closed 40.82 points or 0.50 percent higher to 8,274.19 points , compared to the 8,314.67 close a week ago .

it fell 1.41 percent from Thursday . 
&quot; More corporate earnings results outside the banking and finance sectors are scheduled to be released next week . 
investors have expected that most of the results would be poor and they &apos;ve discounted this news through heavy selling this week . 
the index , however , should gain slightly on a technical rebound , &quot; said Padermpob Songkroh of Nava Finance and Securities . 
brokers said the index would move in narrow range as it lacked fresh , positive news to bolster heavy investment . 
Manila - Manila shares are likely to drift in directionless trade next week as investors stay on the sidelines awaiting market-moving developments , traders said . 
&quot; Market will be relatively soft . 
it &apos;s hard to predict because the volatility is so high . 
half of the investors are saying sell while the other half say buy , &quot; said Corazon Guidote , head of Philippine equities at UBS Securities ( East Asia ) Ltd . 
the main index slipped 10.71 points to close at 2,671.39 on Friday . 
but week-on-week , it rose nearly three percent or 65.74 points from the previous 2,605.65 level . 
Kuala Lumpur - Malaysian stocks are expected to improve next week with share prices and volumes rising on institutional interest , brokers said . 
&quot; There should be some improvement next week , with maybe some more funds taking a look , &quot; said Fiona Leong , head of research at JM Sassoon in Kuala Lumpur . 
Jonathan Duckett , an institutional dealer at Mohaiyani Securities , said : &quot; I &apos;m looking for more volume , &quot; noting that next week will be the first full five-day week after two four-day weeks in a row .

the market was closed on Thursday for a Moslem religious holiday . 
Jakarta - Jakarta stocks are likely to be mixed in the coming week after rising about four percent in the last week , analysts and brokers said . 
&quot; Some overseas players might continue buying blue chip stocks as their prices are quite cheap . 
but they are likely to take profits before the elections take place , &quot; said Holan Sitorus , an analyst with Nikko Securities . 
Indonesia holds general elections on May 29 . 
Sitorus said the last week &apos;s sharp rises are unlikely to continue unless there was some strong positive news or more positive first quarter results . 
but some rises are likely as overall sentiment is buoyant , he said . 
on Friday , the Jakarta composite index closed at 673.69 points against the previous week &apos;s close of 647.89 points . 
Seoul - The stock market is expected to be hit by rumours of corporate financial woes next week , brokers said .

local issues are likely to dominate the market next week with the Australian budget on Tuesday and major banks Westpac and National Australia Bank reporting their half-year results . 
Wellington - Corporate earnings from two of New Zealand &apos;s biggest stocks , Telecom Corp and Carter Holt Harvey , are expected to dictate direction in the coming week after last week &apos;s strong gains , brokers said . 
both companies are expected to report sharply reduced profits , the former reflecting economic slowdown and one-off costs and the latter depressed pulp and paper prices . 
brokers said Telecom &apos;s job would be to convince investors that its growth phase was not over . 
&quot; Carter is very important because it will give a lead in the building sector and there are some doubts there , &quot; said SBC Warburg broker Paul Nicolson . 
new Zealand &apos;s top 40 share index ended the week up 46 points , 2.0 percent , at 2,312 , reflecting domestic interest rate cuts . 
Bombay - Indian shares are seen better next week though an anticipated increase in government-set oil prices may overshadow safe passage of a pro-market budget , dealers said .
