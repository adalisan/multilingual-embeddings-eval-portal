Paine Webber analyst Bernard Savaiko said a bear flag pattern has formed on the charts , and pegged an interim downside target around current levels , between 10.83 and 10.81 .

Savaiko noted that countries withholding stocks have contributed to higher prices , and expectations that exports should increase in the coming months has lend some fundamental weight to the recent selloff .
