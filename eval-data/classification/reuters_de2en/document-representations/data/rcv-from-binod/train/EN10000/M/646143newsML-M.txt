CSCE cocoa futures finished higher in dull trading on Monday , bolstered by local short covering and light trade buying , dealers said . 
dealers said much of the session &apos;s activity centered nearby switches , with outright buying accounting for little of the estimated 5,979 lots traded on the day . 
&quot; Most of the volume was switches , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; And there was some local short-covering in July . 
Front-month July futures rose $ 17 a tonne on the day , to $ 1,430 , having ranged between $ 1,432 and $ 1,420 . 
Second-month September closed $ 16 higher , at $ 1,471 , while the outer months finished up $ 15 to $ 27 . 
cocoa prices headed lower at the opening , on the heels of a weak performance in London overnight . 
some traders said the latest CFTC Commitment of Traders report , which showed speculators ( non-commercial plus non-reportable ) net long nearly 18,000 lots in the two weeks ended June 3 , may have dampened sentiment . 
one trader said the drop in cocoa &apos;s total open interest on Friday took some of the pressure off July , but other traders said the spot contract was likely to see further speculative liquidation ahead of its first notice day June 17 . 
while July &apos;s open interest fell by 2,834 lots on Friday , they said it was still high at 17,117 lots , and a major speculative sell-off in the next week would not come as a surprise . 
technically , a chart gap from $ 1,432 to $ 1,441 would continue to pose an overhead challenge to the July contract . 
near-term support was noted at $ 1,420 , then $ 1,410- $ 1,408 . 
although fundamental developments were still scarce , some traders were monitoring the long-term weather maps for signs of El Nino . 
EL Nino , which can bring drought to West Africa , would probably have more of an effect on next year &apos;s harvest , they said . 
options activity was also quiet today , with total options turnover reaching 922 lots .
