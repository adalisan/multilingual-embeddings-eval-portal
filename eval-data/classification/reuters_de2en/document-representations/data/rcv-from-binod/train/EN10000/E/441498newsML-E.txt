the following is a selection of economists and analysts initial reaction to Japan &apos;s October-December GDP ( gross domestic product ) data , which the government said on Thursday rose a real 1.0 percent quarter on quarter , or an annualised 3.9 percent . 
&quot; It &apos;s within expectations . 
it reflects some pre-consumption tax ( hike ) demand , some effects of the weak yen on exports and the near-ending of inventory adjustment . 
we &apos;re still waiting for April-June ( to see if recovery is solid ) . 
&quot; The number was by no means a surprise . 
&quot; compared to the previous quarter , consumption was supported by good sales of passenger cars and increased retail sales . 
this suggests that consumption was the leading item for the GDP growth in the October-December quarter and for the fiscal year . 
&quot; We are forecasting a small plus in the final quarter of the fiscal year . 
so probably the fiscal year figure will be a little higher than 2.5 ( percent , the government ) projection . 
all these indicate , the statistics are confirming , that the recovery is continuing a bit more strongly than before . 
I think this is a very good prelude for 1997 fiscal year . 
the biggest impact from the consumption tax rise was on housing starts as consumers rushed to buy housing before the tax goes up in April . 
&quot; A sudden drop is expected for the next quarter in housing starts , &quot; Kiuchi told Reuters Financial Television . 
the effect of the consumption tax rise on other consumer items will emerge more in the next quarter . 
&quot; Net exports will make a positive contribution to the GDP and that has been shown in the recent improvement in the trade statistics from the international balance of payments . 
&quot; Imports are still increasing , but there is a strong increase in exports . 
that will provide a pleasant surprise in the short term . 
&quot; These numbers show that the economy probably has a little more momentum than most people thought up until now . 
companies are investing more , and they aren &apos;t completely irrational . 
&quot; I think what they &apos;re looking at is that the yen is at 120 to the dollar , growth is stronger in the U.S. than most people thought , China is booming , East Asia is moving and Europe is starting to come out of its funk , so exports are going to be strong . 
capital investment is going to be strong , so I think we are actually going to get a surprise over the next few months -- the Japanese economy is going to be stronger than most people think . 
&quot; As you look ahead , with the government slowing down domestic growth through these higher taxes , my sense is that export growth is going to be even stronger in the rest of this year . 
that &apos;s what is going to drive the economy -- exports and capital investment which is related to exports . 
the bond market bullishness was underscored by an EPA official &apos;s remark that Japan &apos;s growth will slow in early 1997 / 98 . 
looking at details , housing investment was strong at four percent , suggesting last-minute demand before the scheduled consumption tax increase in April . 
but such demand will fall in the 1997 / 98 , implying chances that a temporary economic setback predicted by the government may last longer .
