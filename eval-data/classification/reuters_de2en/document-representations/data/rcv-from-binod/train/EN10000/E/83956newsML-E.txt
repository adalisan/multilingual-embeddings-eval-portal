Japan , seeking economic recovery amid tight fiscal restraints , breathed a sigh of relief on Saturday when the Group of Seven &apos;s ( G7 ) top economic policy makers sought no further stimulative economic steps . 
&quot; There was no mention made ( about additional monetary or fiscal steps ) . 
even though our economic policy is related to global issues , it is up to us to decide on the current monetary and fiscal policies , &quot; Japanese Finance Minister Wataru Kubo said at the conclusion of Saturday &apos;s talks . 
both the MOF minister and the Japanese central bank governor assured the rich industrialized nations -- the United States , Britain , France , German , Japan , Canada , Italy -- that Japan &apos;s economy was heading toward self-sustainable recovery based on private sector demand , although the tempo was still gradual . 
BOJ governor Yasuo Matsushita told finance ministers and central bankers that Japan &apos;s monetary policy would continue to be designed to create a solid base for economic recovery . 
Kubo told reporters he saw no sign of public works spending wearing thin later this year , and said the planned consumption tax hike from three to five percent to make up for previous tax cuts would be implemented as planned in April 1997 . 
snowballing public debt that accounts for 90 percent of its gross domestic product and dwindling tax revenues from years of sluggish economic growth have made Japan &apos;s budget deficit the worst after Italy among the G7 nations . 
Kubo , who flew into Washington on Saturday morning , also dodged prodding by the United States in a brief meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin just before the G7 meeting . 
before Rubin could tell Kubo it was &quot; critically important &quot; that Japan continue to pursue a policy aimed at promoting domestic demand-led growth , Kubo told him he knew what the treasury secretary wanted to say . 
Kubo continued that Japan would carefully monitor its own economy and continue to direct policies toward ensuring such growth . 
but he stressed the urgent need to fix the deficit , a senior Ministry of Finance ( MOF ) official said . 
other countries , especially in Europe , are struggling to reduce budget deficits under the Maastricht Treaty to qualify for membership in the European Monetary Union . 
the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , in its semi-annual report , painted a bright picture of the Japanese economy , which has responded remarkably well to stimulative efforts by authorities , with growth estimated at 3.5 percent this year after edging up only 0.9 percent in 1995 . 
the G7 nations on Saturday continued to welcome recent moves in the currency markets and agreed to continue cooperating in the foreign exchange arena . 
&quot; By strengthening the economy , we can lighten support from the government . 
we can find a way to achieve economic recovery and fiscal consolidation , &quot; Kubo said .
