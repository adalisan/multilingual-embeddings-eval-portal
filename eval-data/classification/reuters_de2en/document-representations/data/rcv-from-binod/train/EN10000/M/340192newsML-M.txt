gold prices held steady just above $ 350 an ounce through an uneventful options expiry on Wedensday , but dealers said they did not rule out a probe of lower levels later in the day . 
Bullion fixed at $ 351.10 an ounce , up from the morning &apos;s $ 350.15 but still below Tuesday &apos;s London close of $ 352.80 / $ 353.30 . 
&quot; The expiry has passed without incident , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; The current price is actually quite neutral . 
gold has been down to $ 346 recently as well as $ 357 , so $ 350 is right in the middle of the two extremes . 
options dealers had predicted strikes ranging between $ 350 and $ 355 were most likely to be exercised . 
but another dealer said gold may experience a delayed reaction to the expiry later in the day . 
&quot; Sometimes people wait till the last minute in New York , and then they cover , &quot; she said . 
in New York , COMEX February gold was down $ 1.80 an ounce at $ 352.20 . 
gold started the day under pressure , after its rally with silver topped out on Tuesday at around $ 357.50 . 
profit-taking had come in and a surging dollar and revitalised stock markets encouraged selling in bullion . 
the weakness continued in the Far East , where speculators took profits on higher yen-priced gold futures and the professionals unloaded bullion in arbitrage dealings . 
early Europe also saw gold heading lower after coming under pressure from producer and institutional selling , dealers said . 
technical analysts said gold could expect support at $ 350 and then $ 348 , but the next serious support would be at $ 345 . 
silver effectively gave up its market leadership of the past few days on Tuesday and succumbed to falling gold prices . 
a concentration of calls at the key $ 5.00 level failed to come into play at the expiry . 
it was indicated at $ 4.90 / $ 4.92 , down seven cents , having gained 30 cents in the preceding four trading days to briefly touch a high of $ 5.08 . 
dealers said it had room to correct even lower , depending on gold &apos;s behaviour , with $ 4.85 as the likely nearby support level . 
platinum was also lower , fixing at $ 354.75 in the afternoon versus a close of $ 357.25 / $ 358.25 . 
support was expected to kick in at around $ 353 and then $ 350 . 
palladium was $ 1.25 lower at $ 120.50 / $ 121.50 .
