Pakistan &apos;s Supreme Court prepared on Wednesday to decide whether to restore deposed prime minister Benazir Bhutto and possibly scrap Monday &apos;s election . 
a seven-judge bench opened what was expected to be its last hearing of arguments from lawyers for Bhutto and President Farooq Leghari , who dissolved the National Assembly ( lower house ) and sacked Bhutto &apos;s government on November 5 . 
the court was expected to announce a short order , or summary of its decision , some time on Wednesday . 
if it rejects Bhutto &apos;s plea that Leghari had no grounds for firing her on charges of corruption and misrule , national and provincial elections will go ahead on Monday as planned . 
a ruling in Bhutto &apos;s favour will plunge Pakistan into fresh uncertainty , with the elections likely to be scrubbed . 
however , in a similar case in 1988 , the Supreme Court ruled that the president &apos;s dismissal of a government led by Mohammad Khan Junejo was invalid , but did not reinstate him , saying elections were so close they should go ahead anyway . 
Leghari has said he might resign &quot; on moral grounds &quot; if Bhutto , who has been sacked twice while holding the prime minister &apos;s office , was restored . 
Shahbaz Sharif , brother of Pakistan Muslim League ( PML ) leader Nawaz Sharif , said this week that the party would accept any such court decision &quot; without any reservations &quot; . 
Bhutto has accused Leghari , a former close ally , of seeking to rig the polls against her Pakistan People &apos;s Party ( PPP ) . 
&quot; We know the president wants the elections rigged . 
we know there are a number of seats that have been marked out for rigging , &quot; she told Reuters on Tuesday in a campaign trail interview in the town of Naudero in her home province of Sindh . 
&quot; If the elections are held free and fair , the People &apos;s Party will sweep the polls , &quot; she said . 
Bhutto said Leghari wanted to use his handpicked caretaker government and local administration to rig the elections , but added people would reject the results if the vote was unfair . 
the latest opinion poll , conducted by Gallup Pakistan and published in the English-language daily The News , showed Bhutto and the PPP trailing badly behind Sharif and the PML . 
it found that nearly 40 percent of more than 2,000 people polled across the country said they would vote for Sharif against 20 percent planning to vote for Bhutto . 
however , Gallup said that behaviour of PPP voters in three previous elections suggested another five to 10 percent would return to the Bhutto camp before election day . 
the poll found that former cricket star Imran Khan , who now leads the Tehrik-i-Insaaf ( Justice Movement ) , was personally favoured by 10 percent , but his party , contesting about half the 217 National Assembly seats , attracted only five percent . 
it said that a breakaway PPP faction led by Ghinwa Bhutto , Lebanese-born widow of Benazir &apos;s slain brother Murtaza , was splitting the PPP vote in its southern stronghold of Sindh . 
Karachi , Pakistan &apos;s biggest city , would vote overwhelmingly for the ethnic Mohajir National Movement ( MQM ) , while 50 percent of those polled in populous Punjab province said they would vote for the PML , against only 25 percent for the PPP . 
uncertainty about the Supreme Court decision dulled campaigning , but sporadic violence has been reported . 
on Tuesday , National Assembly candidate Ghulam Nabi , younger brother of Qadir Magsi , chairman of the nationalist Sindh Taraqi Pasand Party . 
was found murdered , relatives said . 
his body was found at a graveyard in his home town of Thatta , in Sindh . 
a bomb blast in Lahore killed Zia-ur-Rahman Faruqi , leader of a militant Sunni Moslem faction , on January 18 .
