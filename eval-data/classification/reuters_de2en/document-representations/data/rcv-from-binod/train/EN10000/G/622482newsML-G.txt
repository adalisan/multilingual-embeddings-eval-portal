far from the Bosnian battlefields that made him a hero in Canada , retired Maj. Gen. Lewis MacKenzie is fighting for votes in this tranquil town in Canada &apos;s June 2 federal election . 
the articulate , lantern-jawed Canadian -- who five years ago led United Nations forces in war-torn Yugoslavia -- is the star Conservative candidate in the electoral district of Parry Sound / Muskoka , about 120 miles ( 193.1 km ) north of Toronto . 
he is a political rookie , but also the party &apos;s best hope in vote-rich Ontario , Canada &apos;s most populous province with one-third of the seats up for grabs in the federal election . 
Conservative leader Jean Charest , who has piloted the party since it was all but wiped out in the 1993 election , has said MacKenzie would be a good deputy prime minister . 
some pundits have touted MacKenzie as future candidate for prime minister . 
but MacKenzie himself rejects the idea , mainly because he is not bilingual in English and French . 
Canada does not have a history of military men in the nation &apos;s highest office . 
while at least six former generals have occupied the White House , none of Canada &apos;s post-Second World War leaders were veterans . 
historian Desmond Morton noted in a telephone interview that Canada had rarely faced a serious threat on its own soil and therefore did not have many military heroes . 
opponents have labeled MacKenzie , 57 , a 33-year career officer a &quot; parachute &quot; candidate who has only recently moved to the area in recent years . 
they critized his preference for world affairs over the everyday problems of this sprawling rural district in Ontario &apos;s so-called &quot; cottage country . 
polls suggest MacKenzie is trailing the bland , but hard-working Liberal incumbent , Andy Mitchell . 
&quot; It &apos;s winnable , but it &apos;s a dogfight . 
that &apos;s why we &apos;re going flat out until June 2 , &quot; MacKenzie said in a recent interview . 
a recent Oracle Research poll showed Mackenzie trailing the Liberals 35 to 29 percent . 
Pollsters said the Liberals were poised for a repeat of 1993 when the Conservatives and the Reform Party split the right-wing vote and the Liberals rode up the middle . 
but Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chretien is taking nothing for granted in this riding , making an unscheduled campaign stop here on Wednesday to shore up Liberal support . 
months ago a MacKenzie victory seemed assured . 
the electoral district was a Conservative stronghold for 40 years before 1993 , Liberal gun control laws were unpopular and MacKenzie was instantly recognizable . 
he gained international fame during a stint as U.N. commander in Bosnia , which ended amid allegations of pro-Serb bias against MacKenzie after he accused Moslems of shelling their own people and blaming Serbs to curry world favor . 
despite being thousands of miles away from central Europe , Bosnia has been an issue in this Canadian election and MacKenzie has faced accusations on two occasions that he committed war crimes . 
the retired general spurned offers by the Liberals and Conservatives to run for office in 1993 . 
instead , he went on the lecture circuit and pursued his hobby of auto racing . 
but eight months after French-speaking Quebec came within a whisker of voting to break away from Canada in an October 1995 referendum , he entered politics &quot; because of my concern about the future of the country . 
on the hustings , he dutifully outlines the Conservative platform on tax cuts , job creation and crime . 
but his real passion is unity and world affairs . 
during a visit to the Baysville senior center , MacKenzie recounted tales from Sarajevo and said that Canadians were too complacent about their country . 
the room fell silent as he recalled the day a mortar bomb landed near a group of children in Sarajevo , maiming several kids who had to have their legs amputated . 
&quot; That &apos;s what happens when a country tears itself apart , &quot; he said . 
another favorite unity parable involves a Canadian unit of English and French-speaking soldiers in Yugoslavia . 
when a patrol of Anglo-Canadians was trapped by gunmen armed with anti-tank weapons , their French-speaking comrades at the base volunteered for a rescue mission that would have meant heavy casualties , MacKenzie said . 
it wasn &apos;t about being French or English . 
I &apos;ve sometimes said if the Americans made an incursion into Quebec , we would be there , shoulder to shoulder , &quot; he said . 
his unity plea gets a few polite nods , but the audience appears more worried about local issues . 
how is that going to fight crime ? 
&quot; one elderly woman said . 
in an editorial , the Bracebridge Examiner suggested MacKenzie &quot; seems oblivious to the fact that jobs and economic security are what matter most ot Canadians .
