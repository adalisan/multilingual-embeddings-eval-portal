European Union countries , with the notable exception of France , gave a cautious welcome on Friday to a carefully crafted draft treaty prepared by Ireland for an EU summit next week in Dublin . 
in tones that were sharply at odds those of his EU colleagues , French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette blasted the planned revision of the bloc &apos;s Maastricht Treaty as not ambitious enough . 
&quot; It mirrors the mediocrity of the negotiations so far , &quot; de Charette said . 
he said France would insist at the December 13 and 14 summit that action be taken to strengthen EU institutions , forge deeper links in matters such as immigration and crime fighting , and to bolster joint foreign and defence policy . 
but de Charette &apos;s outburst at the draft treaty ran counter to the generally positive reaction of other ministers who met in Brussels to discuss the document ahead of the summit . 
&quot; The overwhelming view was that we have a good basis for going forward , &quot; Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring , whose country is current EU president , said . 
in Bonn , Irish Prime Minister John Bruton said German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had given his support to the draft during a meeting between the two leaders . 
the draft , unveiled by Ireland on Thursday , is designed as a working paper for an eventual treaty to be approved by EU leaders at a summit in Amsterdam in June next year . 
at the Brussels foreign ministers &apos; meeting , Germany &apos;s Klaus Kinkel praised parts of the draft as &quot; ambitious &quot; . 
&quot; It shows that progress has been made , &quot; he told reporters , adding that there was need for further negotiation before the treaty itself would be ready . 
Italy echoed this in a statement , saying the treaty , designed to prepare the bloc for a dozen or more new members , was a &quot; satisfactory text open to further improvements &quot; . 
even Britain , opposed to many of the proposals contained in the draft , said the document was acceptable . 
&quot; It seems to present the positions in a fair and comprehensive way , &quot; British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said . 
&quot; It is a very good basis for further negotiations . 
Britain has been seeking to play down predictions that the treaty draft would feed the turmoil over Europe currently infecting the ruling Conservative party . 
Ireland deliberately made no suggestions for how to deal with some of the most controversial issues . 
these include whether to water down a country &apos;s right to veto EU legislation , how many European commissioners there should be in an expanded Union , and how to permit &quot; flexibility &quot; -- allowing some countries to integrate faster than others . 
Rifkind welcomed this , but de Charette said France could not accept a document that was &quot; weak &quot; on institutional reform . 
others were far more conciliatory . 
Sweden welcomed the draft as proof that a treaty could be agreed by next June . 
Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen , echoing comments of others , praised the deftness with which Ireland had drafted the clearly written report . 
despite this , the draft does contain proposals likely to be jumped on by Euro-sceptics in Britain , Denmark and elsewhere . 
Britain , for example , has already said it will not countenance a proposal to lift border controls across the bloc . 
Denmark has indicated its opposition to plans to give the European Commission more of a say in external affairs , notably in trade in services .
