new Zealand &apos;s conservative National Party government surged five points in an opinion poll published on Sunday but may fall tantalisingly short of the support it needs to win re-election next month . 
a TV1 poll showed National up five points at 40 percent while the main opposition Labour Party remained far back in second place on 18 percent , up two . 
the Alliance was steady on 15 percent and New Zealand First tumbled into fourth place , down five points at 14 percent . 
act scored five percent in the TV1 poll , while the Christian Coalition was on 4.5 percent -- short of the five percent needed to be sure of making it into parliament . 
TV1 said National , ACT and the centrist United Party , which looks set to win one local constituency seat , could muster 59 of the 120 seats if the poll &apos;s results held through election night . 
labour , economic nationalist New Zealand First and the left-wing Alliance would have 61 . 
if the Christians could scramble five percent of the vote , TV1 said , then they would get six seats and the parties of the right would jointly collect 62 -- enough for National to remain in office with support from the smaller parties . 
a poll on Saturday in the New Zealand Herald newspaper was gloomier for the government , which fell 2.8 percent to 36.8 while Labour rose five to 21.8 percent . 
the Herald poll would give Labour , New Zealand First and the Alliance 69 seats out of 120 .
