U.S. Defence Secretary William Cohen said on Friday he would hold Gulf security talks with Saudi Arabian leaders in Jeddah on Saturday at the start of a five-day visit to the oil-rich region . 
&quot; There will be a far-ranging discussion of ways in which we can continue the very strong bond that we have and the security relationship , &quot; Cohen told a news conference after a two-day NATO defence ministers meeting in Brussels . 
he said he planned to meet Saudi Defence Minister Prince Sultan and perhaps King Fahd to dicsuss such issues as protection of U.S. troops and cooperation in promoting the security not only of Saudi Arabia but of other Gulf Arab states . 
Cohen will also go to Kuwait , Bahrain , the United Arab Emirates and Oman , meeting Gulf leaders and visiting U.S. troops , before returning home on Wednesday . 
U.S. defence officials said he did not expect any final report from Saudi Arabia on two car bombings in the kingdom that killed a total of 24 U.S. troops stationed there . 
it will be Cohen &apos;s first tour as defence secretary of the potentially-volatile region where the United States maintains a major naval presence based in Bahrain and a fleet of warplanes in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait which keep watch over southern Iraq . 
it will give him a chance to discuss joint security and U.S. troop protection measures , intensified after the Saudi bombings . 
possible U.S. fighter sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE could also feature in the talks . 
Cohen will visit U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and Bahrain , including some 5,000 Americans who were moved to a remote desert airbase in Saudi Arabia after a car bombing at Dhahran in June 25 last year killed 19 American airmen . 
he plans to urge the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council to remain united in a coalition with Washington to keep close watch over Iraq and Iran , which the United States worries could threaten security in the region . 
although the issue is not on Cohen &apos;s formal agenda , the subject of potential multi-billion dollar sales of Lockheed Martin Corp. F-16 fighters could come up on his stops in Saudi Arabia and the UAE . 
the Saudis have been discussing the possibility of buying up to 100 F-16s and the UAE has been exploring the possible purchase of as many as 80 of the attack jets . 
they cost about $ 25 million each , minus associated support and maintenance costs . 
they are contemplating that offer , &quot; one senior U.S. defence official told reporters at the Pentagon last week . 
before leaving for the Gulf , Cohen go to NATO military headquarters in Mons , Belgium , to meet senior U.S. military officers from around Europe . 
he will also attend a ceremony at which Colonel General Leonity Shetsov , Russia &apos;s military liaison officer with NATO , will be presented with the U.S. military &apos;s prestigious Legion of Merit medal .
