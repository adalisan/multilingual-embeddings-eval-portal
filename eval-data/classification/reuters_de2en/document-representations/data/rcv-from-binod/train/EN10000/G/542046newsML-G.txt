Japan &apos;s Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has arrived in Sydney at the beginning of a two day visit to Australia , his first since assuming office . 
Mr Hashimoto is now travelling to a Sydney hotel after his flight from the United States . 
he will be delivering a speech at a function in Canberra this evening , where he &apos;s expected to outline his view of Australia &apos;s role in the Asia / Pacific region . 
in Tasmania , the main memorial ceremony for today &apos;s anniversary of the Port Arthur massacre will be held at the historical site &apos;s convict church . 
thirty-five candles will be lit in memory of those who were killed one-year-ago by 28 year-old gunman , Martin Bryant . 
as well , a metre-long ceremonial candle will be lit , with the names of the victims engraved on its stand . 
the ceremonial candle will be taken to Hobart for an evening service at St David &apos;s Anglican Cathedral . 
later in the night , the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Hobart will celebrate a special mass at St Mary &apos;s Cathedral . 
Wa &apos;s Trades and Labour Council says the only thing that will stop tomorrow &apos;s state-wide industrial action is a guarantee from the Premier to withdraw the new industrial legislation in its entirety . 
the union blockade begins at midnight tonight and is likely to cut Western Australia off from the rest of the country . 
thousands of workers are preparing for the 24-hour strike , which will disrupt industry , hospitals , schools , transport , and flights in and out of Perth . 
yesterday , Premier Richard Court made another appeal for the action to be called off , saying amendments to the labour laws will be detailed in the Legislative Council tomorrow . 
but it appears unlikely there &apos;ll be any change to the Bill &apos;s main provisions with the Government &apos;s refusal to back down on some parts such as donations to political parties and union access to workplaces . 
Australia &apos;s coastline will be thrown open to international competition if the Federal Government accepts a proposal by the Shipping Reform Group . 
the Group &apos;s report recommends the abolition of cabotage - a regime that protects Australian registered ships from competition from foreign owned vessels . 
the Government &apos;s expected to release a report on the proposal this week . 
a move to open up the coastline would be in-line with the 
government &apos;s pre-election commitment to tackle high shipping costs . 
the Transport minister &apos;s office has rejected opposition to the plan from the Maritime Union , which warns it would lead to so-called &quot; ships of shame &quot; plying Australian waters . 
calls by farmers to put a freeze on the A $ 1.4 billion Indigenous Land Fund have been rejected by a Victorian barrister . 
Bryan Keon Cohen says the Federation doesn &apos;t know what it &apos;s talking about . 
the fund was established to assist Aboriginal groups seeking native title , and the NFF says the Wik decision means the fund should be used to compensate native title claimants . 
Mr Keon Cohen says nothing &apos;s changed in relation to what the fund was established for . 
he says it hasn &apos;t got anything to do with compensating Aboriginal people for native title that &apos;s been extinguished . 
coastal management authorities around the nation have been warned to pay close attention to an inquest into the deaths of nine people in a rockfall on a West Australian beach last year . 
five adults and four children died last September at Gracetown , south of Perth , when a limestone cliff they were sheltering under to watch a school surfing carnival collapsed . 
Perth lawyer , John Quigley , who &apos;s representing the families of the victims , says there &apos;s evidence local authorities were aware of the dangers . 
the federal government &apos;s &quot; Work for the Dole &quot; legislation will come under scrutiny in Sydney today when a Senate committee hears submissions from welfare organisations , youth groups and the ACTU . 
the Australian Council of Social Service will reject the scheme and call on the government to implement a program of voluntary work . 
ACOSS also wants the government to reconsider cuts to labour market programs . 
the Environment Minister has announced a plan to further protect fossilised dinosaur footprints at a site in Western Queensland . 
Brian Littleproud says his department and the Winton Shire Council will jointly provide a full-time caretaker at the lark Quarry footprints site . 
he says his department will spend nearly A $ 100,000 to ensure protection .
