the British economy is set for a healthy year during 1997 thanks to forecasts of bumper growth , lower unemployment and a strong currency -- but some of the sparkle will disappear during 1998 , a Reuters survey shows . 
the forecasts were collected as part of a quarterly poll of expectations for British economic indicators and exchange and interest rates . 
forty-two banks , research houses and academics contributed to the Reuters survey , carried out between January 6 and 8 . 
the poll showed that consumer spending would fuel gross domestic product ( GDP ) to growth of 3.6 percent by the third quarter of 1997 , no matter which party wins the general election which must be held by May 22 . 
but the GDP growth levels would slip back to 2.5 percent by the third quarter of 1998 and the new government is expected to raise interest rates moderately to contain inflation , according to the average view of the forecasts . 
&quot; We already have inflationary pressures in the economy , and what is more we have a potentially huge surge in consumer spending coming up , which will fuel price pressures , &quot; said Richard Jeffrey , group economist at Charterhouse . 
base rates , which have been at 6.0 percent since last October , are shaping up to rise above seven percent by the end of the year but are then likely to settle there , according to the average of the forecasts . 
current pressure from the Bank of England to raise rates is being eased by sterling &apos;s spectacular performance on the foreign exchange markets , but the experts predicted that the pound &apos;s current position against the mark and the dollar would not last . 
their median prediction for the end of this year was 2.50 marks and 1.63 dollars , compared with current levels of 2.66 marks and 1.68 dollars . 
analysts said the consumer spending boom would be the principal feature of 1997 . 
&quot; You &apos;ve got building society windfalls , recent tax cuts from the last budget , maturing TESSAs ( tax-exempt special savings accounts ) and stronger house prices , so all of these should feed through , &quot; said Howard Archer , research manager at Natwest Group . 
public debt is expected to be even lower than the government &apos;s official budget targets by the end of this financial year , according to the survey , but again the economists had less optimistic news in the medium term . 
they took on average a gloomier view than the government on public sector borrowing requirement ( PSBR ) during fiscal 1997 / 98 , making an average forecast of 20.5 billion sterling compared with the government estimate of 19.2 billion . 
the experts said British gilts were likely to prosper , at least relative to other bond markets , in 1997 but would probably have to wait until the election was out of the way to enjoy better times . 
the gilt market was also being held back in the near term by the fact that Britain was the only major European economy looking to raise interest rates , they said . 
by the end of the year , the average forecast in the survey put the benchmark gilt yield at eight percent , presumably dragged lower by bearish bond markets in Germany and the United States , although outperforming as they all head lower . 
some of the best news for the British economy came in the jobless forecasts , where some economists predicted full employment by the end of 1998 . 
&quot; Unemployment will fall because the economy will grow strongly . 
this growth will be driven by domestic consumer demand . 
we see gains mainly in the services and financial sectors , &quot; said Philip Uglow , economist at Union Discount . 
at 4.7 percent by third quarter 1998 , Liverpool Research Group predicts unemployment to dip below the official definition of full employment -- five percent -- and a 17-year low of 5.3 percent which Britain experienced in August 1980 . 
according to the average view , by third quarter 1998 unemployment is expected to besix percent , compared with the 6.9 percent posted this November .
