the Polish zloty should hold steady right at the 1.5 percent from parity resistance on Friday , with market focus on dollar / mark moves on world markets in lieu of light activity on the domestic front , dealers said . 
they said the market remained pinned to resistance in slow trade as no large zloty-boosting foreign orders materialised . 
foreigners were expected to pay for $ 60 million of fixed bonds bought earlier this week and buy part of the one billion zloty public offering by Poland &apos;s large Bank Handlowy SA . 
&quot; The market is quiet with the dollar / mark playing a major role on Friday , &quot; said Rafal Kaminski , dealer at Pekao SA . 
at 0854 GMT the zloty was at 1.52 / 1.50 percent from parity against opening &apos;s 1.54 / 1.49 percent and Thursday &apos;s 1.50 / 1.47 . 
it was at 3.2325 / 32 to the dollar , down from 3.2310 / 25 at 0655 GMT and at 1.8655 / 60 to the mark , up from 1.8660 / 70 , in line with dollar / mark moves on world markets . 
on the money market one-day rates , which eased over the last few days on Friday were underpinned by the central bank &apos;s 500 million zloty drainage and 400 million NBP-bill sale offer . 
overnight and tomorrow / next rates were flat at 21.80 / 21.10 and 21.92 / 22.25 percent respectively in moring trade .
