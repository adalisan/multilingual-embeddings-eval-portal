the gold market faces a testing week following the initial digestion of the German government and central bank falling out in public last Wednesday over the country &apos;s gold reserves . 
further concerns for gold could come from the victory of the French Socialists on Sunday which according to likely prime minister Lionel Jospin could lead to easing the austerity programme aimed at getting France comfortably into European Monetary Union ( EMU ) . 
the Bundesbank rejected a call from the Finance Ministry that it should revalue Germany &apos;s gold reserves of around 3,000 tonnes more closely to the current market price for gold and pass over the resulting on-paper profit to the ministry . 
the market &apos;s first reaction was amazement as Europe &apos;s most fiercely independent central bank showed its claws and defended its believe in economic prudence . 
but analysts said the shock for gold would be longer term as &quot; fudging &quot; of the EMU convergence criteria -- as the German move has been described -- could lead to a weaker euro if it was repeated by less financially robust countries . 
gold was priced at around $ 344.00 / $ 344.50 on Monday morning barely changed from Friday &apos;s close and very close to the level at which producer forward selling was forecast to cramp the upside . 
analysts had mixed views on what Germany &apos;s clash would mean for gold . 
some like Andy Smith at Union Bank of Switzerland saw gold potentially offering investors an alternative resort for their money while European currency and bond markets fought with any turbulence . 
it might also reduce the need for central banks to sell gold on the basis of meeting EMU financial criteria . 
&quot; Either there &apos;s postponement ( of EMU ) until this issue is sorted out which is good for gold as a relief factor from sales . 
or if it goes ahead on some balance sheet massaging basis , the need for gold sales is reduced , &quot; Smith said . 
however , other observers were less sure that gold would be a beneficiary . 
Ted Arnold at Merrill Lynch said , &quot; If the Euro is weakened it could encourage the European Central Bank ( ECB ) to sell gold into the market to prop up the euro . 
another analyst though there was a good chance the Bundesbank would succeed in stopping the gold reserve revaluation plan in which case the debate on gold sales would continue and market confidence would be undermined . 
Robert Pringle , the editor of Central Banking , a quarterly journal , said , &quot; Mr Kohl has a habit of getting his own way . 
he added that anything which linked central banks and gold had a &quot; negative image &quot; for the gold market . 
&quot; This is not entirely negative for gold , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But I don &apos;t see a safe haven role for gold yet , &quot; he added . 
all the other major economies in the European Union values gold reserves in some relationship to the market price . 
apart from Germany , only Luxembourg and Sweden have gold booked at its purchase price vastly below the current market . 
when the ECB is in place , gold revaluation will be needed on some basis so that participating countries in EMU can provide the bank with a reserve base .
