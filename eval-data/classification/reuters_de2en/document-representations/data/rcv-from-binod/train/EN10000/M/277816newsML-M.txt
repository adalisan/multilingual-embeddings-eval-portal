Brazil &apos;s real fell 0.06 percent on Friday to close at 1.0392 per dollar on the commercial foreign-exchange market in uneasy and speculative trading , dealers said . 
the real was traded at between 1.0390 and 1.0405 per dollar , with players seeking a hedge against a possible change in the government &apos;s current depreciation policy for the Brazilian currency . 
traders said the market was concerned by speculation that the country &apos;s December trade deficit would reach $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion . 
some players said they believed a large deficit this month could lead the central bank to speed up the real &apos;s depreciation to spur faster growth in exports . 
in the past few months , the central bank lowered the real-dollar mini-band between 0.5 and 0.6 percent per month . 
so far this month , the bank has dropped the mini-band 0.58 percent . 
speculation was fueled by the expectation by some banks that the central bank may lower the mini-band again before the end of the year . 
the current mini-band was set on Monday between 1.0385 and 1.0435 reais per dollar . 
in the floating exchange-rate market , the real closed steady at 1.0442 per dollar . 
in the illegal parallel market , the real ended unchanged at 1.125 per dollar , traders said .
