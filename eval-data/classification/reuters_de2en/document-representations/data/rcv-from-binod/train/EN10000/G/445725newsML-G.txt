the leaders of Israel and Jordan met on Sunday to try to defuse tensions but an Israeli spokesman vowed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would stick by his plans to build a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem . 
an hour before Jordan &apos;s King Hussein went into a meeting with Netanyahu , Israel &apos;s cabinet secretary Danny Naveh insisted the government would not yield to &quot; threats &quot; and &quot; pressures &quot; over the settlement issue . 
Israel &apos;s Deputy Housing Minister Meir Porush said he hoped work on the 6,500 houses for Jews would begin on Monday at the hilltop site on the outskirts of Arab East Jerusalem known as Jabal Abu Ghneim -- Har Homa to Israelis . 
&quot; I cannot tell you the exact date when the work will begin . 
the work is supposed to begin this week , &quot; Naveh told Israel Television . 
Netanyahu says the settlement reasserts Israel &apos;s right to all of Jerusalem and insists Israeli-PLO peace deals do not bar the construction . 
Palestinians claim East Jerusalem , captured by Israel in 1967 , as the capital of a future state . 
the king warned last week of bloodshed if Israel went ahead with unilateral plans to build the settlement . 
earlier on Sunday he paid condolences to families of seven Israeli schoolgirls slaughtered by a Jordanian soldier at their border .
