Bulgaria &apos;s new parliament held its first session on Wednesday , pledging to reform the shattered economy , fight crime and corruption , and bring the country into the European mainstream . 
elections held last month after mass protests forced the fall of the Socialist government in February gave the centre-right Union of Democratic Forces ( UDF ) a big majority . 
&quot; Today , everyone is convinced that a new reformist majority has been born in Bulgaria and you here in parliament are the most important part of it because you are called upon to carry the burden of reforms on your shoulders , &quot; President Petar Stoyanov told the opening session . 
one of the first tasks of the new parliament will be introduction of a currency board , a strict fixed exchange rate regime prescribed by the International Monetary Fund to instil monetary discipline and restore confidence in the Lev . 
&quot; We wish to restore the confidence of the Bulgarian people in our state institutions , the Bulgarian Lev , Bulgarian banks , Bulgarian goods , as well as the confidence of foreign investors , international lending institutions , and foreign governments in our country , &quot; said UDF leader Ivan Kostov . 
UDF supporters besieged and ransacked parliament on January 10 after the Socialists refused to vote on a UDF declaration proposing measures to bring the country out of crisis . 
since February , a caretaker cabinet appointed by Stoyanov has stabilised the national currency and brought bread and fuel shortages under control . 
&quot; The steps we have taken are in the right directions , the confidence of our trade partners and foreign investors is rekindling , and we hope that we can rely on their backing in our goals of European and Atlantic integration , &quot; Stoyanov said . 
the April 19 election , Bulgaria &apos;s third parliamentary poll since the end of one-party rule , gave the UDF and its coalition allies 137 of parliament &apos;s 240 seats , and the Socialists 58 . 
three smaller parties and coalitions are also represented -- the Alliance for National Salvation , which includes ethnic Turks and monarchists , has 19 seats , the Euro-Left of Socialist dissidents 14 , and the populist Bulgarian Business Bloc 12 . 
the deputies , of whom 167 are in parliament for the first time , elected Yordan Sokolov , former leader of the UDF parliamentary group , as speaker . 
&quot; We will have to adopt and implement a number of unpopular laws . 
this will not be easy but we have to get accustomed to hardships , &quot; Sokolov said . 
he urged discipline in parliamentary proceedings and an end to the practice of multiple voting with other members &apos; cards . 
the UDF has nominated Kostov as prime minister , and his government is likely to include several figures from the interim cabinet , which was led by Sofia mayor Stefan Sofianski . 
Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Bozhkov is expected to retain the industry portfolio , overseeing reform of the unwieldy state sector , and Interior Minister Bogomil Bonev is expected to continue his fight against crime . 
UDF sources say coalition spokeswoman Nadezhda Mikhailova is expected to become foreign minister , while Muravei Radev , former deputy head of parliament &apos;s economic commission , is tipped for the finance portfolio . 
&quot; Our aim is that in the first month of the parliament , the laws for introduction of a currency board and the 1997 budget will be passed , and by the end of the year all measures needed to end the country &apos;s severe crisis will be taken , &quot; said UDF deputy Valentin Vassilev , tipped for the trade portfolio .
