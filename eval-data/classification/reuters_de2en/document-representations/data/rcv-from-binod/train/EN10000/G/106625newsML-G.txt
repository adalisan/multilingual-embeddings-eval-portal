the centrist United Party had only 0.7 percent support , below the Aotearoa legalise cannabis Party on 0.9 percent , but it is expected to win one electorate seat . 
a grouping of left-of-centre parties -- Labour , the Alliance and New Zealand First -- would have 72 seats , easily enough to control the 120-seat parliament . 
the poll of 500 people was taken on October 5-8 , straddling Monday &apos;s leaders &apos; debate widely judged to be another victory to Labour leader Helen Clark . 
in the question of the preferred prime minister , support for Prime Minister Jim Bolger fell three points to 18 , while Clark rose three to 16 percent overtaking NZ First leader Winston Peters , down four to 14 percent .

the number of undecided voters shrank to 11 percent from 16 in the last poll on September 26-29 . 
under New Zealand &apos;s mixed proportional system , voters get one list vote and one electorate vote . 
new Zealand First supporters were asked whether they preferred NZ First to be in coalition with National or Labour . 
sixteen percent supported the former and 72 percent the latter .
