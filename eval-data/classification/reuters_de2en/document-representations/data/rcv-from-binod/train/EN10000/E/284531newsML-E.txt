the German economy will gather steam in 1997 , but remain too weak to reduce unemployment , the German Economics Insitute ( IW ) said on Thursday . 
the institute said the main engine of growth would remain exports but that growth in the sector would be slower than overall growth in world international trade . 
economic growth , the report said , would not be strong enough to reduce unemployment below the four million mark . 
private consumption , which many economists are counting on to lift the economy , should climb by more than two percent . 
higher incomes , slow increases in the prices of goods and confidence in the economy should make consumers more willing to spend , IW said . 
consumer prices should pose little threat to economic stability , climbing about 1.5 percent in 1997 , the report went on .
