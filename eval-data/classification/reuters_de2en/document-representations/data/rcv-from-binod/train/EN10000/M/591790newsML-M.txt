the Philippine Central Bank said on Friday it will keep its overnight borrowing rate at 20 percent in order to punish speculators . 
&quot; The market is speculating we &apos;ll lower the overnight rate on Monday ... But we &apos;ll keep it at that level until the market is no longer speculating , &quot; Central Bank Treasurer Sergio Edeza told Reuters . 
he said the Central Bank was buying dollars in the afternoon after it lifted its overnight borrowing rate to 20 from 13 percent . 
but overall on Friday , the Central Bank was a net seller of dollars , he said . 
the peso has been under attack in recent days due to the backlash from the problems of the Thai baht . 
in just two days , the Central Bank had to lift its overnight borrowing rate by a total of 8.75 percentage points . 
on Friday , volume on the Philippine foreign exchange market reached its highest ever level . 
late in the session , it was at $ 647 million .
