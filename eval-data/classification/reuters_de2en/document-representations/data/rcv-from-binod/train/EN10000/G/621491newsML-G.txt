neutral Switzerland , accused of hoarding the wealth of Jews murdered by Hitler , sold the bulk of its wartime arms exports to Nazi Germany , according to Swiss diplomatic archives published for the first time on Wednesday . 
Swiss historian Mauro Cerutti , a researcher who studied the archives , said Nazi Germany got nearly two-thirds of Swiss exports of arms and war material exports from 1940 to 1944 . 
it received arms worth 600 million Swiss francs ( $ 422 million ) at the time . 
&quot; These are official figures . 
they are very precise , &quot; he told reporters . 
&quot; Arms exports ended only at the end of September 1944 following pressure from the Allies . 
other historians said publication of the documents , which had only been open to scholars in the past , supported previous studies that found the Swiss had exported around a billion francs worth of arms and war materiel to Nazi Germany . 
&quot; This is not new , but it still interesting because all these bits of information had been stranded among historic researchers , &quot; said Peter hug , who has studied the wartime era . 
they are the latest in a series of documents now surfacing in Switzerland , where cantonal records in Lausanne recently revealed a mass of individual wartime bank accounts had been closed without the owners &apos; knowledge . 
they come hot on the heels of a scathing U.S. government report published earlier this month , rejected in part by the Swiss government , which alleged the Swiss were bankers to the Nazis and Switzerland &apos;s commerce with Nazi Germany , including trade in looted gold , helped to prolong World War Two . 
Swiss officials have said Switzerland had to trade with Nazi Germany and Berlin &apos;s fascist partners surrounding the Alpine republic because it needed food and fuel to survive . 
Switzerland also traded with the Allies , and provided arms to them as well . 
Cerutti , among the historians who published the unclassified documents in a project aided by the Swiss National Foundation for Scientific Research , said Switzerland exported arms and war materiel worth 900 million francs from 1940 to September 1944 . 
of this total , Axis power Italy got deliveries worth some 150 million Swiss francs but the bulk went to Nazi Germany , he told reporters ahead of a Geneva meeting on the publication of the official diplomatic archives . 
the archives showed Swiss imports from Germany totalled 2.25 billion francs between September 1939 and the end of August 1943 against exports of 1.97 billion francs at values at the time . 
the dollar was worth around four francs at the war &apos;s end . 
the meeting was hosted by the United Nations at its Geneva headquarters , where it got the blessing of a top U.N. official . 
&quot; These documents shed new light on Swiss diplomatic history in the post-World War two era and open a window of understanding to the past , &quot; said the U.N. &apos; s director general in Geneva , former Soviet deputy foreign minister Vladimir Petrovsky . 
Cerutti said the documents revealed much about Switzerland &apos;s wartime record , which the Alpine country has been desperately trying to defend with its moral integrity intact against mounting international criticism . 
but he said they were limited to federal government documents and that questions still remained over the archives in the vaults of Swiss banks , among the world &apos;s most secretive . 
&quot; These documents are very interesting , but there is also a need to access the archives of private banks , &quot; Cerutti said . 
&quot; We have to acknowledge that pressure from the United States prompted all of us to think about these matters . 
it is clear that we now have to identify the wartime role of Switzerland . 
one document showed how former Swiss foreign minister , Max Petitpierre , complained of Swiss banks &apos; insistence on retaining their secrecy rules and named Swiss private and commercial bankers taking part in meetings with officials . 
&quot; The documents reveal the attitude of Swiss banks . 
they refused an intervention by the authorities , &quot; Cerutti said . 
in a sign of Swiss unease over their wartime links with Nazi Germany , another document showed how Swiss industrialists helped pay for a trip to Switzerland by Winston Churchill , Britain &apos;s former prime minister , in September 1946 . 
&quot; They were trying to turn the page on their contributions to Germany , &quot; Cerutti said .
