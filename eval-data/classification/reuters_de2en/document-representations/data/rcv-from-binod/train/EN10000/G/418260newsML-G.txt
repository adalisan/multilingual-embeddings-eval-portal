a French centrist parliamentarian submitted legislation to the National Assembly on Tuesday that would allow archives from the World War Two Vichy regime to be opened immediately . 
Francois-Michel Gonnot proposed an amendment allowing access to such files after 50 years , whereas French law currently keeps the files under lock and key for 60 years . 
Gonnot &apos;s amendment follows a government decision to conduct an inquiry into seizures of Jewish property during the Nazi occupation . 
&quot; The 60-year delay deprives even today , more than a half a century after this painful period of our history , the heirs of the victims from having access to many documents , &quot; Gonnot said . 
he said that shortening the period barring access to the files would give the descendants of victims of the Nazis and Vichy access to records that might help them recover property seized from their families . 
it would also facilitate the government probe . 
Jewish groups have expressed interest in some 5,500 cartons of records from the collaborationist wartime Commission for Jewish Affairs which have been collecting dust in the national archives since the end of the war .
