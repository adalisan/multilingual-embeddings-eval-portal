the turbulent political currents lapping the banks of the River Congo have left smugglers and dugout canoe paddlers busier than ever . 
officially the river border has been closed since Laurent Kabila &apos;s rebels toppled Zaire &apos;s President Mobutu Sese Seko at the weekend , but neither in the capital Kinshasa or in Congo &apos;s capital Brazzaville can anyone stop the traffic . 
&quot; It is busier than ever , this is the only way that anyone can travel at the moment , &quot; said Everiste Somba , the foreman of a canoe fashioned from a single tree trunk . 
after a seven-month war Kabila proclaimed himself president and said he would change Zaire &apos;s name to the Democratic Republic of Congo . 
Congo , whose president Pascal Lissouba was close to Mobutu , on Friday noted the change of power across the river and said it was ready to support the efforts of the new authorities there to promote democracy . 
Slithering down a steep and muddy cliff in Brazzaville a constant stream of porters carrying sacks and crates passes a similar trail coming the other way . 
security forces would not dare show their faces at the Brazzaville terminal , in the opposition Bakongo stronghold , where militiamen with AK-47s carry out a cursory customs inspection for a fee . 
travellers are registered in the militia &apos;s exercise book , for which another fee , but definitely no rubber stamp . 
&quot; You can feel absolutely safe once you are registered , if anyone tried to rob you then we would deal with them , &quot; assured one militiaman . 
Paddles driven deep into the Congo take the canoe way upstream , past bathers and women washing clothes , to allow for the current which sweeps down the river -- less than three km ( two miles ) across at its narrowest point . 
only from inside the canoe , just above the surface , does the scale of the traffic appear . 
muscular boatmen reaching high into the air are silhouetted in an almost unbroken line against the horizon . 
the only sound is the plunging of the paddles into the current , stirring a stream of froth from the ale-coloured water and pushing aside drifting clumps of water hyacinth . 
the only exhaust fumes come from the marijuana cigarette of paddleman Francois Wazikanda . 
&quot; Towards Zaire we go with rice and flour , then from the other side we bring back beer , clothes and little luxuries and at the moment petrol , &quot; said Wazikanda . 
Wazikanda brought senior members of Mobutu &apos;s government out on his canoe as the rebels moved into the city at the weekend , and then went back to the landing point to pick up their families . 
&quot; It was very good business , they paid very well , &quot; he said . 
free trade on the river stretches over 1,600 km ( 1,000 miles ) into Africa &apos;s forested heart and existed long before rival colonial powers founded Kinshasa and Brazzaville in the 1880s . 
journalist turned explorer Henry Morton Stanley founded Leopoldville , later renamed Kinshasa , on behalf of Belgian King Leopold II at the lowest navigable point of the river before rapids that lead to the Atlantic . 
his French rival Pierre de Brazza planted the tricolour on the north bank . 
the colonialists brought often barbarous methods to exploit the supposed riches of the interior , but neither their new rules nor any government since have been able to effectively control the river trade . 
since the rebel takeover in Kinshasa the traders have pushed their landing point as far as a nearby road skirting foreign embassies in an exclusive residential area . 
taxis wait for the surge of goods which , since the takeover , have no other way of entering the country . 
not a rebel soldier is to be seen , nor a customs official . 
&quot; We don &apos;t worry about the rebels , they haven &apos;t disturbed us yet and we know they could never stop us , &quot; said Somba . 
&quot; The river is too big &quot; .
