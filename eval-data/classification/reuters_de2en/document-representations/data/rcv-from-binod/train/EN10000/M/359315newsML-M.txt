the prices of U.S. Treasury securities closed narrowly mixed in very quiet trading before the release of Friday &apos;s nonfarm payrolls report . 
initial jobless claims came in about 12,000 below forecasts and minutes from the Federal Reserve showed its policy-making arm retained a bias toward tightening at its December meeting . 
the 30-year long bond ended 1 / 32 lower at 96-22 / 32 . 
its yield was unchanged at 6.76 percent . 
a Reuters consensus for the employment report called for the creation of 237,000 payrolls and 5.2-percent jobless rate . 
I don &apos;t know what the Labor Department &apos;s problem is , but this number keeps getting goofier in its preliminary form , &quot; said Fred Sturm , economist with Fuji Securities Inc . 
Sturm said that the gap between the original number and the final revision two months later is so wide as to render the headline number almost meaningless . 
the only component he pays attention to , Sturm said , was average hourly earnings -- which also captures the Fed &apos;s eye . 
Sturm said a reading of unchanged to less in average hourly earnings would be unambiguously bullish , a 1-cent to 5-cent hike neutral and anything above 5 cents bad news . 
&quot; You couldn &apos;t talk away from a number like that , there &apos;s no way around it , &quot; he said . 
more importantly , Sturm said the range of forecasts for the healine number &quot; covered a 40-acre field -- a dead giveaway that nobody knows what &apos;s going on . 
Sturm saw a neutral headline number leaving the bond market vulnerable to a slight pullback , to levels seen about a week ago when the long bond was yielding 6.85 percent . 
the Fed continues to preach that patience is a virtue , &quot; said Cary Leahey , senior economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc . 
Leahey noted that initial jobless claims were weaker than expected and crimped the market somewhat early in the session , before it recovered to levels steady from Wednesday &apos;s close . 
&quot; A lot of people were taking profits from the big rally we &apos;ve seen and exiting the market -- setting positions before the payrolls number , &quot; Leahey said . 
&quot; That &apos;s pretty much all that happened today -- a downtrade to take advantage of the rally . 
Leahey said he expected to see payrolls rise 225,000 given the five-week reporting period . 
Chrysler Corp. priced a $ 500 million century bond as corporate issuance continued strong . 
however , Hugh Johnson , chief economist at First Albany Corp. said supply was not weighing on the bond market . 
&quot; There &apos;s substantial liquidity right now . 
the question is how demanding the borrowers will be , &quot; Johnson said . 
payrolls data will set the tone for the bond market for the next three weeks , Johnson said , and he expected Friday &apos;s report to contain a number of surprises . 
Johnson also expected a 225,000 rise in payrolls and intended to closely watch the average hourly earnings , average workweek and overtime hours components of the report . 
&quot; It was quiet today ahead of payrolls as you would expect . 
this has been an extremely important number for the last 24 months , &quot; Johnson said . 
also on Thursday , the two-year note was down 1 / 32 at 99-30 / 31 and yielded 5.91 percent ; the five-year closed unchanged at 100-4 / 32 and yielded 6.22 percent , and the 10-year note closed up 1 / 32 at 100-8 / 32 to yield 6.46 percent .
