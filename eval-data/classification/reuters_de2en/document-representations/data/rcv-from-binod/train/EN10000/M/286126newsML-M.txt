sterling climbed back against major currencies on Friday after falling on weak U.K. asset markets the day before , and analysts said its strength was still intact despite Thursday &apos;s sudden drop . 
recent economic data showing healthiness in Britain &quot; s economy , allied with expectations of a rise in key interest rates soon are still supporting sterling after its temporary weakness , they said . 
&quot; All the evidence points one way today , which is for a stronger sterling , &quot; said UBS senior currency economist Peter von Maydell . 
&quot; People were getting nervous over equities and trying to sell it off . 
they &apos;ve seen sterling sold off in the past in equity market corrections , &quot; Maydell said . 
U.K. stock and government bond markets suffered substantial losses on Thursday afternoon , led by their U.S. counterparts which fell on the back of strong NAPM data . 
this weakness triggered selling of sterling across the board , with the pound falling to $ 1.6885 / 95 and 2.6067 marks by late European trade from the day &apos;s highs of $ 1.7130 and 2.6415 marks . 
but analysts and traders did not think this meant sterling &quot; s rally had ground to a halt , saying very thin volume -- many participants were still away for New Year holidays -- and the pound &apos;s volatility contributed to Thursday &apos;s big drop . 
&quot; That is always the danger with sterling , you take your eyes off it for five minutes and it &apos;s come down two or three big figures , &quot; one trader said . 
by the European afternoon on Friday , the pound had recovered to $ 1.6950 / 60 and 2.6310 / 20 marks . 
long-held expectations of a rise in British interest rates , perhaps as early as January 15 , should continue to be the major driving force for sterling &apos;s bullish trend , analysts said . 
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England governor Eddie George hold their next monthly monetary meeting on January 15 . 
some , however , warned that such interest rate speculation may be overdone . 
&quot; The market &apos;s getting ahead of itself in terms of rates , &quot; said HSBC James Capel &apos;s U.K. economist David Bloom . 
&quot; The market &apos;s expecting maybe two interest rate hikes before the ( May ) elections . 
it might be disappointed .
