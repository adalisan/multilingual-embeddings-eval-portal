U.S. treasuries reversed earlier weakness in Tokyo and surged higher in London on Tuesday , propelled by robust European bond markets and a strengthening dollar , analysts said . 
the rally seemed likely to build over the next few days , and analysts said they saw nothing looming on the near-term horizon to reverse the global bond market rally . 
&quot; The market should keep pushing higher , &quot; said Nick Benton , trader at BankAmerica in London . 
&quot; We &apos;ll see 6-1 / 4 yield on the long bond by Friday . 
the benchmark U.S. 30-year bond was trading at 102-02 to yield 6.35 percent at 1100 GMT , well above Tokyo &apos;s 101-25 close and 101-27 in New York . 
&quot; The strong dollar , and the anticipation of flow of funds into the U.S. , is the key influence , &quot; said Dick Howard , director of economic research at Julius Baer Investments in London . 
strong European markets were also bolstering the U.S. Treasury rally , analysts said . 
&quot; The U.S. market is getting dragged up here , which is a little unusual , &quot; Benton said . 
&quot; It is usually the other way around . 
analysts said market euphoria had overridden Monday &apos;s stronger than expected National Association of Purchasing Management ( NAPM ) figures and that the market had largely shrugged them off . 
&quot; The numbers yesterday weren &apos;t bond market friendly , but the market still ended slightly up , &quot; Howard said . 
&quot; The market certainly has a healthy tone to it . 
Howard said once long-bond yields reached the 6-1 / 4 level , a wave of profit-taking could set in . 
&quot; You start thinking about taking profits , wondering if there is any sustainability in the rally beyond that , &quot; he said . 
economists expect leading indicators to rise 0.1 percent in October after a gain of that amount in September . 
new home sales are expected to come in at 772,000 versus 816,000 in September . 
the market would largely ignore these figures and was waiting for Wednesday &apos;s Beige Book report from the Federal Reserve and Friday &apos;s non-farm payroll figures , analysts said . 
&quot; Today &apos;s figures would have to be exremely negative to have any kind of impact at all in the current market , &quot; Benton said . 
Howard said the market would be watching closely for any signs of pockets of inflation or labour market tightness in Wednesday &apos;s Fed report . 
March T-bond futures were at 116-02 in automated trade , up 6 / 32 from Chicago &apos;s settlement on Monday .
