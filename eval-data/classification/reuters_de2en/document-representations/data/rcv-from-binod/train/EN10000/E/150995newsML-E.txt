Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said on Tuesday that he was confident the government would meet its fiscal deficit and economic growth targets for 1996 / 97 ( April-March ) . 
&quot; This year I am determined to keep the fiscal deficit at five percent &quot; of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , Chidambaram told the World Economic Forum . 
but I am confident we will keep the fiscal deficit at five percent .... There is no reason to believe that this government has given up its goal of containing the fiscal deficit . 
the fiscal deficit , or total net government borrowing , was 5.9 percent of GDP in 1995 / 96 . 
the finance minister said that during the first five months of 1996 / 97 , tax revenues as a share of total revenues were at the same level as the average of the last five years . 
Chidambaram told the business leaders that he expected the government to achieve its target of seven percent annual GDP growth over the medium term by implementing its policy agenda , called the Common Minimum Programme ( CMP ) , drawn up in June . 
&quot; Seven percent ( growth ) is not easy to achieve , &quot; he said . 
&quot; If we do not implement the programme sincerely , we will not achieve seven percent . 
the government has a tentative GDP growth target of 6.6 percent for 1996 / 97 . 
the finance minister acknowledged that it would be hard to push growth beyond 6.0-6.2 percent with the current household savings rate , the existing level of government red ink and the existing current account deficit . 
but Chidambaram said the government was committed to improving the efficiency of capital , raising the savings rate and attracting large foreign exchange inflows . 
&quot; We will do every one of these things to raise growth beyond seven percent , &quot; he said , without specifying a time period . 
&quot; I am confident that if we implement the CMP in its letter and spirit , we will be able to achieve seven percent growth . 
Chidambaram said six percent GDP growth was not satisfactory , and acknowledged that currently &quot; there is a slight slowdown &quot; . 
but he said industrial production in 1996 / 97 was expanding at an annual rate of more than eight percent , and predicted agriculture production would touch a new peak this fiscal year . 
he said the services sector was growing at a reasonable rate . 
&quot; With the reduction in real interest rates , I expect the economy to pick up , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We have the capacity to grow at seven to eight percent , &quot; he said , without specifying the time period .
