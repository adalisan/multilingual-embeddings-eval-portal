Qatar &apos;s emir on Tuesday named his younger brother as prime minister and asked him to form a new government . 
officials and diplomats expect the new cabinet to introduce changes to the running of the energy industry in the oil and gas-rich state . 
&quot; His Royal Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani today issued a decree appointing Sheikh Abdullah bin Khalifa al-Thani as prime minister and asked him to form his new cabinet , &quot; a senior palace official told Reuters . 
Western-educated Sheikh Abdullah , the current deputy prime minister and interior minister in the Gulf Arab state , is expected to announce the cabinet within a few days , he added . 
the official Qatar News Agency carried the text of the decree , which said the appointment takes effect immediately . 
the emir had held the post of prime minister since he ousted his father , Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad al-Thani , in June , 1995 . 
Sheikh Abdullah played a role in the coup . 
the emir last week named his third son , Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani , 18 , as Crown Prince . 
officials and diplomats said the reshuffle was expected to introduce changes , including abolishing the oil ministry and setting up a supreme energy council to be headed by the emir . 
the emir last week , in a step towards restructuring the government by separating royal powers from those of the cabinet , issued a decree redefining his powers and jurisdiction as executive head of state . 
he also redefined the role of prime minister and cabinet as senior executive organs of government . 
under a provisional constitution in force since 1971 , the emir acted as his own prime minister . 
Ministers were appointed and fired at his sole discretion . 
last week &apos;s decree separated the prime minister &apos;s office and the royal court or emiri Diwan . 
Ministers will be appointed at the recommendation of the prime minister . 
it rules that the cabinet will be collectively responsible to the emir for implementing the general policy of the state . 
officials and diplomats said the changes are prompted by the need to give adequate representation to different sections of the ruling al-Thani family , which constitutes the largest single chunk of the native population of around 120,000 . 
Qatar is a small oil exporter whose native population is among the world &apos;s richest with gross national product of $ 22,000 each . 
some 440,000 foreigners , mostly from the Indian subcontinent and Iran , work in Qatar . 
Qatar &apos;s oil reserves are overshadowed by its natural gas deposits which are exceeded only by those of Russia and Iran .
