prices of the fifth and sixth tranches of Russian MinFin bonds edged up on position-squaring in otherwise quiet Friday trading , dealers said . 
they added the market was awaiting clues for further moves in Russia and from U.S. Treasury bonds next week , as the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) is meeting on Tuesday to deliberate interest rates . 
tranche Aug 15 Aug 14 
1999 maturity ( 3 ) 92.00-92.20 91.85-92.15 
2003 maturity ( 4 ) 70.80-71.00 70.90-71.15 
2008 maturity ( 5 ) 53.70-53.90 53.50-53.75 
2006 maturity ( 6 ) 59.45-59.65 59.40-59.65 
2011 maturity ( 7 ) 47.45-47.60 47.40-47.65 
&quot; It is just some minutes ago that we have seen some moves . 
people have been sleeping the whole day , &quot; Avtobank dealer Ivan Kuznetsov said . 
dealers said tiny deals were seen in 2008 and 2006 maturities , apparently on low-scale position-squaring by some Western banks . 
&quot; Maybe people prefer to do what they wanted today instead of waiting for next week , when no one one knows what will happen , &quot; Kuznetsov added , referring to the FOMC meeting .
