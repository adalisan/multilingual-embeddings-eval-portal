Bulgaria posted a current account deficit of $ 22.3 million last year after a $ 25.6 million deficit in 1995 , preliminary Bulgarian National Bank ( BNB ) figures showed . 
exports fob 4,723.8 5,345.0 
imports fob 4,579.5 5,224.0 
receipts 181.0 149.8 
payments 575.8 581.8 
trade figures based on customs data . 
banks reported exports of $ 4,752.7 million and imports of $ 4,664.9 million in 1996 , the BNB said . 
exports fell 11.6 percent year-on-year in 1996 while imports decreased by 12.4 percent . 
the fall in exports was due to lower foreign demand , a fall in local industrial output , high interest rates , restructuring of the industrial and financial sectors and rising energy prices , the BNB said . 
sales to the European Union ( EU ) member countries had the largest share in Bulgaria &apos;s exports at 36.5 percent . 
slower GDP growth rate of those countries last year was the main reason for the falling demand for Bulgarian goods , the BNB said . 
Bulgarian exports also suffered from bank closures and liquidation or financial isolation of loss-making state enterprises in line with a funding agreement with the international Monetary Fund signed in mid-1996 . 
imports fell mainly due to the sharp depreciation of the Lev currency against the dollar and declining purchasing power of companies and individuals . 
the Bulgarian Lev fell to around 500 per dollar at the end of last year from around 71 at the beginning . 
the BNB central interest rate rose to record high of 300 percent annually in September from 34 percent in January . 
consumer price cumulative inflation for last year was 311 percent . 
the sharp Lev fall failed to boost Bulgaria &apos;s exports as around 61 percent of the cost of Bulgarian industrial products depends on imported raw materials , the BNB said .
