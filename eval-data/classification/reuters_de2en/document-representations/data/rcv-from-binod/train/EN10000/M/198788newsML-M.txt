Australian shares closed slightly weaker on Monday with opening gains eradicated by afternoon profit-taking after the market was held back by a sell-off of Coca-Cola Amatil stock . 
key share market barometer , the All Ordinaries index , closed 3.5 points lower at 2,383.8 , after hitting an intra-day and all-time high of 2,398.6 during early morning trade . 
trading was active as engineering group ANI topped turnover after major shareholder Ross Palmer sold 40 million shares . 
&quot; The market was doing alright even with the slump in Coca-Coal Amatil stock this morning but this afternoon investors took the top off the market across the board , &quot; said Eric gale , director of institutions at Sydney brokerage , ord Minnett . 
gale said the late sell-down could be attributed to profit-taking after the market &apos;s strong rise in the past two session in the past week . 
&quot; The market expected Coca-Cola to get slammed , and that &apos;s exactly what happened , &quot; gale said . 
Coca-Cola Amatil disappointed investors late on Friday when it warned that its 1996 profit would be flat . 
dealers said that because the market had the weekend to digest Coca-Cola Amatil &apos;s profit downgrade , it was possible the company &apos;s shares could make a slight recovery within the next two sessions . 
major banks were the most noticeable targets of profit-taking with the National Australia Bank and Commonwealth Bank losing all their early gains , while resource majors BHP and CRA ended firmer but off the day &apos;s highs . 
behind the strength of the resources sector was the more robust outlook for base metal prices , after copper found good support in active trade on the London Metal Exchange on Friday .
