CSCE coffee futures ended up sharply Monday , as broad-based short covering lifted the spot September contract to its highest settlement in nearly a year , traders said . 
the most-active December contract rose to its highest close in nearly four months . 
&quot; It is a squeeze , and shorts are being forced to cover , &quot; said Refco analyst Ann Prendergast . 
traders and analysts noted that there were still no delivery notices issued against the spot September contract , which entered notice period last Thursday and expires September 18 . 
on Friday , September &apos;s open interest fell 48 lots , to 2,089 lots , the equivalent of over 500,000 bags of coffee . 
the Exchange reported last Monday its warehouses held only 34,516 bags of coffee . 
the CSCE will release updated U.S. certified stock figures after today &apos;s close , and some traders said they anticipated a further decline in CSCE warehouse inventories . 
&quot; September coffee led the way , with another fall in CSCE weekly warehouse stocks expected in the data due later Monday , and the break of the key $ 1.30 resistance level ( last week ) leading to further buying , &quot; Smith Barney analyst Walter Spilka said . 
Front-month September ended 4.20 cents higher , at 136.45 , its highest level since September 6 . 
benchmark December coffee closed up 2.65 cents a lb , to 125.20 cents , after ranging between 128.50 and 119.75 . 
the remaining months ended 1.65 to 4.25 higher . 
local liquidation of long positions pressured values from the outset , traders said . 
but after the selling dried up , funds covering short positions , combined with trade and commission house buying , pushed December coffee through 124.50 resistance . 
September also breached today &apos;s upside target of 134.00-135.00 . 
meanwhile , the nearby September / December switch swelled to 11.25 cents today , compared with 9.70 cents on Friday , while the December / March switch widened to 7.50 cents versus 6.50 cents at Friday &apos;s close . 
traders said the market also got a boost from news earlier Monday of torrential rains and gale force winds in parts of central Colombia . 
but there was no assessment yet on any damage Colombia &apos;s coffee crop , which begins harvest next month , may have sustained . 
volume was brisk , at an estimated 11,671 lots .
