a Reuters poll of Taiwan economists on Tuesday projected an average 6.902 percent year-on-year rise in Taiwan &apos;s industrial output in April . 
the official figures were due to be released by the economics ministry at 0230 GMT on May 21 . 
industrial output rose 10.01 percent year-on-year in March . 
the following table gives institutions &apos; forecasts in percent for year-on-year growth of Taiwan &apos;s industrial output in April : 
institution growth 
core Pacific Securities 6.43 
grand Cathay Securities 7.8 
national Securities 5.28 
Nomura Securities 6.7 
---- average 6.902 
economists attributed the poll &apos;s relatively strong growth forecasts in part to a low comparative base in April 1996 , when industrial output edged up only 1.06 percent year-on-year . 
&quot; tensions between Taiwan and China in early 1996 continued to have a negative impact on the April 1996 industrial output , &quot; said National Securities economist Lin Kuo-yang . 
China , which has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since a civil war split them in 1949 , held series of war games near the island in 1995 and early 1996 to warn voters in Taiwan &apos;s March 1996 presidential election that Beijing would not tolerate moves toward Taiwan &apos;s independence . 
the economy &apos;s generally stable recovery would contribute significantly to higher industrial output growth in April , said Nomura Securities economist Amy Huang .
