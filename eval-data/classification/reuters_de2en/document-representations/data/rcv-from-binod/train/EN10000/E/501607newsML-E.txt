Japan &apos;s current account surplus will expand this fiscal year on the back of the weaker yen , but will stop increasing next fiscal year , economists predicted in a Reuters poll released on Thursday . 
predictions made by 31 economists from banks , brokerages and research institutes in Tokyo and London gave an average forecast of a surplus of 8.4 trillion yen ( $ 66.1 billion ) for the year to March 31 , 1998 . 
the forecast was the same for next fiscal year . 
&quot; The rapidly weakening yen and relative firmness in overseas economies , especially the United States , will support Japan &apos;s trade surplus for now and in the coming months , &quot; said Kyohei Morita , an economist at Nomura Research Institute Ltd . 
after hitting a record high of 79.75 yen to the dollar in April 1995 , the yen has followed a steady downward path . 
it was trading at about 126.80 to the dollar on Thursday morning . 
Shuji Shirota , an economist at Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities and Economics Inc , predicted the trade surplus would grow in the first half of 1997 / 98 as a result of manufacturers increasing exports to compensate for a sluggish domestic market resulting from an April 1 sales tax increase . 
the economists said exports would be boosted by the weaker yen , which makes Japanese products more competitive abroad , as well as by strong demand overseas . 
they predicted that Japan &apos;s merchandise trade surplus would reach 10.5 trillion yen ( $ 82.6 billion ) in 1997 / 98 and 11.2 trillion yen ( $ 88.1 billion ) in 1998 / 99 . 
but Shirota said the pace of the rise in the current account surplus may slacken as early as the second half of this fiscal year . 
he said private demand was likely to rebound after a temporary setback , which would prompt manufacturers to export less and encourage more imports . 
ongoing structural changes , such as companies shifting production abroad , would also continue to dampen growth in the surplus , economists said . 
&quot; The overall shrinking trend in the surplus will be maintained . 
we expect overseas economies to weaken and see a good possibility of Japan &apos;s economic performance improving in 1998 / 99 , &quot; said Nomura Research &apos;s Morita . 
the economists said that as Japan &apos;s current account surplus increased , the yen would become firmer against the dollar and work to cap growth in the surplus . 
Salomon Brothers Asia predicted an average dollar exchange rate of 117.90 yen for 1997 / 98 and 103.80 yen in 1998 / 99 . 
however , currency movements would likely have less impact on current account data than in the past because of the shifting of production centres overseas , economists said . 
also the interest rate gap between Japan and United States was more likely to widen than narrow and would restrict any yen surge , they said . 
income surplus , a component of the current account surplus which derives mainly from portfolio investment income of Japanese investors , would grow on the back of steady outflow of capital abroad , the economists said . 
they predicted that the deficit in the services component of the current account figure would continue to expand , with Japanese travellers going abroad regardless of the direction of the yen . 
the survey covered 33 brokerages and research bodies , although not all those polled responded to all the questions . 
it was carried out between April 1 and April 4 .
