California &apos;s Supreme Court ruled on Monday that San Diego County may receive repayment for certain welfare costs in a decision that could open the door for other counties to seek reimbursements , attorneys involved in the case said . 
in an opinion released in San Francisco , the state Supreme Court remanded to the state &apos;s Commission on State mandates &quot; to determine the amount of reimbursement , if any , due San Diego . 
San Diego was seeking reimbursement from the state for certain costs of providing health-care services to the poor . 
attorneys for San Diego County hailed the ruling but said the county &apos;s fight for reimbursement was far from over . 
&quot; The check is not in the mail because we now essentially have to prove our damages , &quot; said Ian Fan , deputy San Diego County counsel . 
&quot; It will be a while before we get any money . 
fan added , however , that the state Supreme Court ruling could clear the way for other counties to obtain repayment . 
&quot; It sets a new standard for what a mandate is , and that will be important for all other counties in the state , &quot; he said . 
in its ruling on Monday , the state &apos;s Supreme Court affirmed &quot; the finding that the Legislature &apos;s exclusion of medically indigent adults from Medi-Cal ( the California Medical Assistance Program ) &apos; mandate ( d ) a new program or higher level of service . 
California state officials said they have to review the ruling further before commenting in detail , though they warned the decision could have serious financial implications . 
&quot; This ruling could open up a number of significant fiscal and policy issues , &quot; said H.D. 
Palmer , a spokesman for the state &apos;s Department of Finance . 
&quot; But we &apos;re not going to make a snap judgement on dealing with this .
