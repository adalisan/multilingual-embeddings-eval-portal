Lithuanian independence hero Vytautas Landsbergis was poised on Monday to make a comeback to power as a parliamentary election put his party firmly out in front . 
results trickling in from the Sunday poll put Landsbergis &apos;s Homeland Union party in the lead though support fell short of an outright majority . 
his party &apos;s lead was overshadowed by voter apathy with the turnout of 55 percent well under the 75 percent registered four years ago . 
but the stocky former music professor looked set to avenge his election defeat in 1992 by ex-communists -- a humiliation for the man who had led the Baltic state &apos;s dramatic independence bid from the former Soviet Union the year before . 
by 0930 GMT , with results in from just 339 out of 2,037 voting districts , the Homeland Union had 28 percent of the vote for party lists , chosen under a proportional representation system . 
the ex-communists of the Lithuanian Democratic Labour Party ( LDLP ) were running second in the poll at 10.51 percent . 
Landsbergis told reporters that the results so far meant the Homeland Union had won 32 seats out of the 70 decided by the party list vote . 
the remaining 71 seats in parliament are decided on a majority vote system and a second round run-off will be held for these places on November 10 . 
Landsbergis , avoiding any sign of triumphalism , said the Homeland Union &apos;s win was not clear cut and negotiations to build a coalition were necessary . 
the Homeland Union has said it will work with the Christian Democrats , who stress traditional values in this Roman Catholic country of 3.7 million . 
it might also invite the Centre Union . 
Landsbergis , who constantly sniped at the LDLP for corruption when he was in opposition , said he wanted to start work with a &quot; clean pair of hands &quot; . 
&quot; We want to see a Lithuania as different as possible from the Lithuania under Communists , &quot; he told reporters . 
&quot; The Lithuania under ex-communists was no different from the Lithuania under Communists , &quot; he added . 
the LDLP were propelled back into power in 1992 on a platform of promises to ease the pain of the country &apos;s reform to a market economy . 
critics accuse it of corruption and croneyism while many people say they fail to notice big changes in their lives six years after quitting the former Soviet Union .
