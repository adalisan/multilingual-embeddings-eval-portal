Polish T-bill yields are expected to stay flat at Wednesday &apos;s 400 million zloty primary auction after the treasury froze minimum prices during previous auctions , dealers said on Tuesday . 
dealers said demand at the additional mid-week auction could double the treasury &apos;s offer but that foreign investor bids may be curbed by a relatively strong zloty . 
&quot; The ministry needs to fill a gap in the budget , so prices will not rise if this means rejecting most bids , but they are not likely to fall either , &quot; said Krzysztof Kozuchowski , T-bill dealer at ING bank in Warsaw . 
dealers expected many investors to test the ministry for higher yields but most said that minimum prices would likely stay flat at 81.85 for the benchmark 52-week T-bill and at 90.03 for the 26-week paper . 
&quot; Prices will be flat after the treasury showed that it will not let yields rise further , &quot; said Bartlomiej Kumela , dealer at Societe Generale in Warsaw . 
on Tuesday the treasury released budget deficit figures for the first quarter , which showed a 3.96 billion zloty gap amounting to 32.4 percent of the planned 1997 shortfall .
