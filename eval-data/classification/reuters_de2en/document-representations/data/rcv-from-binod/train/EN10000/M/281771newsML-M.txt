the Federal Reserve will add temporary reserves to the banking system on Tuesday , probably through two-day system repurchase agreements , analysts said . 
&quot; We &apos;ve got some notable pressure because of the year-end coming up and the Fed will try to counter that , &quot; said Michael Moran , chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc . &quot; We &apos;re looking for a rather aggressive reserve addition -- probably two-day ( system repurchases ) after Monday &apos;s seven-day operation -- to counter the reserve pressures . 
Federal funds opened at seven percent on Tuesday and slipped to 6-1 / 2 percent in early trade . 
the Fed &apos;s target for the funds rate is 5-1 / 4 percent . 
&quot; volatility is the watchword for the funds market today , &quot; said William Sullivan , senior vice president and director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds . 
&quot; We opened at 7.0 percent and , as always , the final trading day of the calendar year will be volatile in the funds market , &quot; said Sullivan . 
&quot; Fed funds traded as high as 15 percent on Monday and that set the stage for today when we not only have year-end pressures , but also ( bank reserve maintenance ) period-end pressures that include the settlement of the two- and five-year notes ( that the Treasury sold last week ) . 
Sullivan said the Fed would add temporary reserves to the banking system through term system repurchase agreements . 
Kim Rupert , senior economist at mms International , concurred , citing period- and year-end pressures as well as reserve demand tied to the settlement of the two- and five-year notes that the Treasury sold last week .
