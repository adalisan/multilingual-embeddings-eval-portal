former President George Bush , 72 , plans to make a parachute jump on Tuesday to fulfil a pledge he made to himself after his Navy plane was shot down in World War Two , a U.S. Army spokesman said on Monday . 
Bush , who made his first parachute jump out of a crippled airplane over the Pacific Ocean during the war , will jump from a civilian aircraft 2,500 feet ( 762 metres ) over Yuma proving Ground in Arizona , spokesman Doug Smith said . 
&quot; According to President Bush &apos;s people , President Bush made a promise when he bailed out of his plane in World War Two in the Pacific that someday he would make a parachute jump out of an airplane that wasn &apos;t an emergency jump , &quot; Smith said . 
Bush renewed that pledge at a recent meeting of the U.S. Parachute Association where he was given a vintage World War Two parachute . 
he will make the jump with several civilian members of the parachute association and three military experts from the Army &apos;s Golden knights parachute team , Smith said . 
Bush , accompanied by his wife Barbara , is scheduled to arrive in Yuma on Monday afternoon for some training with the Army experts , he said .
