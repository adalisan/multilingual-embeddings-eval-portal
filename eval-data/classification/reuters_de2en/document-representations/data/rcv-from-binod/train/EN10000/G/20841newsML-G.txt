the fragile French franc bore the brunt of a rampaging German mark in Europe on Thursday as jitters over Economic and Monetary Union in the run-up to 1997 budget presentations kicked in with a vengeance . 
debate over the EMU timetable and fresh question marks over efforts to meet convergence criteria have rekindled fears which had been largely soothed by a European Union show of unity . 
threats of strikes in France , coupled with weak data there , have pointed up the difficulty of reconciling fiscal austerity with public resistance to the spending cuts demanded by EMU . 
analysts said the pressure on the franc , which sank to five-month lows in early Europe , was unlikely to ebb before the 1997 budget was unveiled -- and maybe not even then . 
&quot; The French arithmetic will add up -- but the credibility of those sums will be immediately questioned , &quot; said Stuart Thomson , chief international economist at Nikko Europe . 
&quot; The next level to focus on is 3.4305 , and I think there &apos;s a very strong risk of that appearing today . 
the franc &apos;s early low of 3.4296 per mark -- its worst level since March 25 -- took it to within a whisker of 3.4305 , its old floor in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism ( ERM ) . 
French teachers &apos; unions have warned of a likely strike over job cuts and education reforms and will meet on September 3 to finalise their position . 
Marc Blondel , leader of the independent Force Ouvriere union which was at the fore of last year &apos;s 24-day strike , has said &quot; all the ingredients are there for it to explode &quot; . 
&quot; The risks in attempting to straitjacket economies to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria are highlighted by threats of labour and social unrest in France following similar disturbances last year , &quot; said David Coleman , chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy in London . 
weak output and fears forthcoming July unemployment will stick at record highs have emphasised how French economic growth needs a shot in the arm if EMU criteria are to be met . 
even Germany , the lynchpin of EMU , is in danger of missing the requirements on debts and deficits this year , Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing warned earlier in the week . 
but Issing signalled clearly the German central bank &apos;s continued tough line on monetary union , saying softening the convergence criteria was &quot; out of the question &quot; . 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl backed that on Wednesday , saying the single currency &quot; must come , but there should be no feeble compromises &quot; . 
but market fears of a delay in monetary union -- scheduled to begin on January 1 , 1999 -- have found plenty to feed on . 
Italy &apos;s deputy prime minister , Walter Veltroni , was quoted recently as saying Italy and other European countries should consider the possibility of re-thinking the EMU criteria . 
leading German economist Herbert Hax said Europe should consider postponing the start of EMU until at least five countries and preferably more meet the conditions for joining . 
&quot; All the European issues are still quite alive , and that will keep the mark firm , &quot; said Standard Chartered treasury economist Tim Fox . 
&quot; It doesn &apos;t augur well for the outer-rim currencies . 
mark strength was just what Germany &apos;s Bundesbank was presumed to deplore when it sliced an unexpectedly meaty 30 basis points off its key repo rate last week . 
while that was initially seen as a lifeline for the mark &apos;s fragile satellites , the view soon took hold that the German bank had used the cut to wash its hands of EMU and currency problems . 
the Bundesbank may thus have done more harm than good , forcing France and Italy in particular to look to their own governments for salvation , said Coleman at CIBC . 
&quot; The convergence process -- so evident in the first half of this year -- remains very much at risk , &quot; he said .
