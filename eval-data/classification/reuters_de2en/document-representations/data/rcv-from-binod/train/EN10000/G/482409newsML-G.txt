a major Iranian exile group said on Wednesday a well-known writer and publisher had been murdered in Tehran and suggested the country &apos;s Islamic authorities were responsible . 
the National Council of Resistance ( NCR ) , in a statement issued in Geneva where the United Nations Human Rights Commission is holding its annual session , said Ibrahim Zalzadeh had been the victim of &quot; criminal assassination . 
the Paris-based NCR , linked to the Mujahideen Khalq armed opposition group which operates from Iraq , cited reports emerging from Tehran as saying he was abducted on his way home from work on February 24 and later killed . 
the statement said he had been buried by the Iranian authorities without his family being notified . 
&quot; On frequent occasions in the past , the mullahs have murdered writers and leaders of confessional minorities in similar fashion , &quot; it added . 
the statement was issued a day after a report to the Commission from U.N. human rights investigator for Iran Maurice Copithorne said the Tehran government had maintained heavy pressure on dissent in 1996 although there was a &quot; climate of change &quot; on the status of women . 
Copithorne , a Canadian lawyer , has been criticised by some delegates to the six-week meeting of the 53-member body for failing to include details of executions inside the country and assassinations of Iranian exiles abroad in his report . 
in a separate statement on the 22-page document , the NCR alleged that last year at least 32 political opponents of the Iranian administration were assassinated abroad , four times the number in 1995 , and that 150 people had been officially reported executed , three times the number in 1995 . 
the exile group &apos;s leader , Massoud Rajavi , was quoted as saying that although Copithorne &apos;s report gave &quot; a glimpse of the atrocities &quot; carried out by the Iranian authorities , it did not adequately reflect &quot; the severity of the regime &apos;s crimes .
