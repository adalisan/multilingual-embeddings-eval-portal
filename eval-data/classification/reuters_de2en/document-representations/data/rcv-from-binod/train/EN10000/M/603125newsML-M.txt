June BTP futures are likely to be well-supported above the 130.50 level in a positive session on Wednesday , technical analysts said . 
&quot; The market is looking slow at the moment , but it is well-supported above 130.50 , with yesterday &apos;s low at 130.54 , &quot; said a technical analyst at an Italian bank in London . 
he pegged main support levels below this area of support at 130.00 and 129.90 and said the market was likely to stay up in the short-term . 
&quot; On the upside the objective is to take 131.10 , &quot; he said . 
the analyst placed levels of resistance further up the chart at 131.40 and 131.80 . 
he said the area around 131.80 was an important benchmark level which the market last approached in January this year , and reaching this would indicate a good opportunity to sell . 
&quot; For today on the trendline the market will continue to look positive if it stays above 130.80 , &quot; he said . 
Richard Adcock , manager of technical research at HSBC futures the market looked as if it wanted to push on a little further , but had failed to break through the 131.25 level . 
&quot; The first resistance point tested was 131.25 and that held and we are now slipping back . 
I think we need to see the market slip back a little bit under the figure towards 130.75 , &quot; Adcock said . 
&quot; That weakness should offer a buying opportunity . 
the 130.75 area was a congestion region a few days ago which BTPs have risen above . 
he placed upside resistance through 131.25 and 131.48 after that , with further support around 130.50,55 and said the overall picture was constructive .
