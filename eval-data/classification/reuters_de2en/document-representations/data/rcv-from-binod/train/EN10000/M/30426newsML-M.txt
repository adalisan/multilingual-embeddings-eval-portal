German Bund futures recovered strongly in late trade on a classic short-covering rally after the U.S. NAPM report . 
analysts said the gains , however , may not be sustainable with traders still nervous about the direction of U.S. interest rates and inflation . 
they said the market &apos;s gains accelerated after the Bund future contract broke above psychological resistance at 97.00 . 
Bunds were little moved by a 0.2 percent monthly gain in German industrial production figures . 
the September DTB futures contract was down five basis points at 97.22 , near its high for the day of 97.26 . 
traders said the U.S. attack on Iraq was not overly worrying . 
they said as long as oil prices do not spike surprisingly higher , inflation fears should remain limited . 
they said that Bunds rather will focus on upcoming economic indicators such as German gross domestic product data and unemployment on Thursday and U.S. unemployment on Friday . 
the ability of Bunds to climb above psychological resistance at 97.00 helped the chart picture .
