U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton , visiting one of the world &apos;s most crowded cities , praised Mexico on Tuesday for its work in family planning and curbing high population growth rates . 
&quot; When it comes to family planning , Mexico is one of the success stories of this hemisphere , &quot; the wife of U.S. President Bill Clinton told the private Mexican Foundation for Family Planning ( Mexfam ) . 
Mexico cut its population growth rate from more than three percent in the mid-1970s to the current rate of 1.8 percent . 
still , the country &apos;s population has swollen to some 90 million in recent years and Mexico City alone is home to 18 million . 
Mrs. Clinton and Mexican first lady Nilda Patricia Velasco watched a play at Mexfam that dramatised family planning and took place on a fictional street named Hillary Clinton . 
called &quot; The kiss That Inseminates , &quot; the skit told the story of a young girl who thought she might be pregnant after getting kissed on the cheek by a boy . 
she is taken by her more knowledgeable friends to a family planning centre . 
&quot; I was pleased to see the skit today because the skit is a very good way to communicate information to young people and that &apos;s something we don &apos;t do enough of in our country so I am going to bring that idea home when I return , &quot; Mrs. Clinton said . 
after the skit , Mrs. Clinton , wearing a green pastel suit , chatted to the children about youth problems . 
Mexico &apos;s government has in the past decade promoted information about birth control despite opposition by some local Catholic church leaders . 
&quot; Mexico should be proud of the fact that you are a leader in ensuring that people have the information they need to protect their own , &quot; Mrs. Clinton said , adding that statistics show some 90 percent of Mexican families have access to birth control information . 
Mexfam head Alfonso Lopez urged the United States to continue helping to fund the group , which receives annual aid from the Agency for International Development . 
Lopez said the United States planned to cut off aid to the group in 1998 . 
following the Mexfam event , Mrs. Clinton had lunch with a group of prominent Mexican women including novelist Angeles Mastretta and Mirelle Rocatti , the head of the Mexican Human Rights Commission .
