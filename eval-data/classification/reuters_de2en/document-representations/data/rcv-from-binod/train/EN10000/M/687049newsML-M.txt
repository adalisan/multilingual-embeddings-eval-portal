White sugar futures resumed their downward trend on Wednesday but while fund players were still baling out of nearby August the pace of the selling was now starting to dwindle , traders said . 
bargain hunters moved in as August slid to an intraday low of $ 315.20 , although August / October was still under pressure at under $ 3.00 . 
traders said the weakness on August could spark buying of the August / July white premium with the open of New York . 
&quot; There &apos;s a little less ( fund selling ) than there was yesterday -- that &apos;s why it &apos;s holding at the moment , &quot; said one market source . 
&quot; We &apos;ll see what happens when New York comes in , there may be a little premium buying , &quot; he said . 
on Tuesday , persistent commission house selling of August squeezed the August / October through support at $ 4.00 . 
hefty speculator liquidation was cited . 
much of the August activity was said to have been channelled towards the July raws contract . 
at 1145 GMT August was down 70 cents at $ 316.00 and October down 20 cents at $ 314.00 . 
volume was 630 lots . 
but in the Paris market volume amounted to an unusually higher 1,414 lots with 1,308 lots in August alone , which was down 70 cents at $ 316.00 . 
October was up 10 cents at $ 314.00 . 
traders attributed the solid turnover to pre-hedging against the EU &apos;s weekly tender for sugar export licences .
