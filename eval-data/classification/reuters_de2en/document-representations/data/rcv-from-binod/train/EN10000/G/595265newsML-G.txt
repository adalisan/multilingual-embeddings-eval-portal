the latest offensive by Sri Lankan troops could possibly be the last big push against Tamil Tiger rebels , and is likely to weaken the guerrillas considerably , diplomats and analysts said on Monday . 
they said by opening two simultaneous fronts , the military had ensured that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) rebels were spread thinly on the ground and were unable to launch any concerted attack on the security forces . 
&quot; The aim seems to be to dilute the power of LTTE by making them fight on two fronts and also prevent them from launching major attacks on the troops , &quot; one Asian diplomat said . 
troops backed by tanks , artillery and air cover launched one of their biggest offensives against the LTTE last week from Vavuniya , 220 km ( 135 miles ) north of the capital Colombo . 
the offensive , aimed at opening a land supply route linking Vavuniya with the Jaffna peninsula , about 100 km ( 60 miles ) further north , has so far managed to carve fresh inroads into LTTE &apos;s northern Wanni heartland , military officials have said . 
if troops gain control of the Wanni they will restrict the LTTE to northeastern jungles and eastern parts of the island . 
troops broke out from Vavuniya and northeastern Welioya as part of the offensive code named &quot; Jaya Sikuru &quot; , or &quot; sure of Victory &quot; . 
they have captured Omanthai , 14 km ( nine miles ) north of Vavuniya and Nedunkeni , about 40 km ( 25 miles ) northeast from Vavuniya , after fierce fighting . 
the LTTE , fighting an ethnic war now in its 14th year for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in predominantly Sinhalese Sri Lanka &apos;s north and east , control vast swathes of land in the mostly shrub-covered Wanni . 
the Defence Ministry said on the weekend that at least 250 rebels had been killed since the offensive began and 42 soldiers had also died . 
newspaper reports put the army &apos;s casualties at 70 and hospital sources said more than 300 soldiers were wounded . 
the LTTE have said that they have lost 37 fighters in the offensive and will continue fighting for their homeland . 
the LTTE have accused the army of killing Tamil civilians and destroying property under the pretext of opening up a supply route , and of routinely exaggerating rebel casualties . 
a military analyst , who declined to be identified , told Reuters that the army had broken the LTTE into three parts by cutting across the Wanni region . 
&quot; The LTTE has been cut into three pieces -- on the west ( towards Mannar , which the military captured in February ) , northeast and south of Welioya -- making it extremely difficult for them to mount a big attack , &quot; the analyst said . 
the LTTE might be weakened more after being pushed further into the northeastern jungles as they stood to lose vast areas with Tamil civilians , their main pocket of recruitment , the analyst said . 
he said the army would be able to hold the supply route to Jaffna , the former rebel stronghold now under government control , once it is opened , although it might take casualties because of hit-and-run attacks by the LTTE . 
&quot; I think they ( military ) are prepared to take a few casualties as the road is crucial . 
the LTTE will have the advantage of surprise attacks on three fronts , but the army should be able to hold its positions if they are able to get in reinforcements quickly , &quot; the Asian diplomat said . 
but Veerasingham Anandasangari , vice president of the Tamil United Liberation Front ( TULF ) , warned that although a major thrust of this nature would weaken the LTTE militarily , it would drive them away from the negotiating table . 
&quot; The LTTE is not likely to talk from a position of weakness . 
they will not come for negotiations under these circumstances . 
peace talks between the People &apos;s Alliance government and the LTTE broke down in April 1995 after the rebels sank two naval boats in the eastern Trincomalee harbour . 
Anandasangari told Reuters that the opening of a land route from Colombo to Jaffna would be a boon to Tamils in the north as it would cut travel time substantially . 
&quot; Granted , all should be pleased about it . 
but the government should be more cautious and concerned about civilians in achieving this goal , &quot; he said , expressing his concern about hundreds of people who have been displaced by the offensive .
