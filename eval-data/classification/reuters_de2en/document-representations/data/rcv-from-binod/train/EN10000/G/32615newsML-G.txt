the House by voice vote Wednesday passed legislation allowing the secretary of the Treasury to issue five new quarter-dollar coins each year for 10 years , commemorating each of the 50 states . 
the measure would allow the Treasury to begin issuing the commemorative quarters in 1997 . 
the quarters will be standard circulating coins , similar to those issued in honor of the U.S. bicentennial in 1976 . 
the Senate has not yet taken up the bill .
