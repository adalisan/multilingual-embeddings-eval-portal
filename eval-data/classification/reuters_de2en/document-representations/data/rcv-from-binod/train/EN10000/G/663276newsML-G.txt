Francisco Xavier da Silva , 20 , was hit in the back by a bullet near an air force base in Rio de Janeiro as he ran away from four guards on Friday , Globo television said . 
&quot; I went up to the wall and was having a pee when they came up to me and told me it was a military area , &quot; he said from a hospital bed , where he was recovering from intestinal surgery .
