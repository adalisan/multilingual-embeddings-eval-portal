White sugar futures retained most of the gains made in a fund-led buying spree but the earlier strength was dampened by profit-taking and a lacklustre New York . 
steady buying from one leading commission house , thought to be on behalf of fund clients , drove the spot October contract to a fresh life high of $ 331.00 -- but trade and brokers were quick to cap the gains . 
the buying then dried up in the afternoon and interest shifted to the spreads , with small amounts of Oct / Dec , Dec / March and March / May trading . 
the nearby Oct / Dec spread narrowed to around $ 5.00 from $ 6.00 earlier in the session . 
&quot; London has lost its ground this afternoon , &quot; said one trader . 
some outright December buying was also seen from a leading European broker . 
traders said they were continuing to monitor the build-up in fund positions in the London market . 
at 1445 GMT October was up 40 cents at $ 329.10 and December up 70 cents at $ 324.00 . 
volume was 1,390 lots . 
Paris was subdued with just 233 lots posted on the board . 
October was down 40 cents at $ 328.60 and December up 30 cents at $ 323.30 .
