copper prices shook off their midsession blues during more active Wednesday afternoon LME trading , pulling other metals to higher closes . 
traders said there was a knock-on affect from copper extending its move above $ 2,200 , and zinc and nickel reached fresh highs for this current bull-run . 
&quot; They ( markets ) kicked into action again this afternoon , and some of the shorts got nervous , &quot; said Martin Squires of LME trader Rudolf Wiolff and Co . 
apart from copper , there was an influx of trade interest throughout the complex , while investment fund buying re-appeared in the zinc and nickel markets , he noted . 
copper &apos;s spread premiums firmed again with cash / three months whipping back above the $ 200 backwardation level . 
nearby prompts continue to trade at or near the $ 23 daily LME limit - a trend seen continuing up to the Feb date two weeks away . 
earlier , February traded option declarations passed routinely , with the market falling between strikes and thus generating little followthrough excitement . 
however , once the options passed by there was some fresh buying , which eventually lifted prices up to the $ 2,240 level by Wednesday &apos;s kerb close , up $ 36 from Tuesday . 
Fund interest helped zinc move through the previous high and tough resistance in the mid- $ 1,170s , although there is further overhead supply stretching up to $ 1,200 . 
last trade was at $ 1,184 , just off an $ 1,190 peak , but up $ 15 from Tuesday . 
nickel momentarily broke above the important chart point of $ 7,820 on speculative buying , before settling back to close the session at $ 7,810 , still up $ 125 . 
aluminium similarly advanced during the afternoon rings , but again ran into tough resistance above $ 1,625 . 
nevertheless the close at $ 1,632 , up from an overnight $ 1,617.50 , suggests that there will be another re-test of $ 1,640 soon . 
lead inched higher , with this market continuing to trade routinely , and last business was at $ 681 , up just $ 3 . 
tin also crawled higher , and finished at $ 5,860 , only $ 5 up from the overnight kerb . 
the alloy market closed at a slightly higher $ 1,535 / 40 a tonne .
