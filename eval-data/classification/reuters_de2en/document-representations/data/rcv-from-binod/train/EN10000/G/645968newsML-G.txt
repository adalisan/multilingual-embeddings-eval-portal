Paris is sending more troops to Congo Brazzaville , beginning on Monday , following the death of a French soldier in a firefight in the capital Brazzaville , the Foreign Ministry said on Sunday . 
&quot; French military reinforcements will be flown to Brazzaville beginning tomorrow , &quot; ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said in a statement . 
the statement did not say how many troops were involved . 
there are currently about 450 French soldiers in Brazzaville , stationed there several months ago in case they were needed to evacuate foreign nationals from Kinshasa during the final days of the civil war there that brought rebel leader Laurent Kabila to power . 
one French soldier was killed and five others wounded in Brazzaville on Saturday evening as they attempted to evacuate a group of foreign residents from a building where they were pinned down . 
a senior officer in the Congolese army who was working with the French soldiers was also wounded in the clash . 
Doutriaux said France hoped for a cease-fire in the conflict , followed by a political solution .
