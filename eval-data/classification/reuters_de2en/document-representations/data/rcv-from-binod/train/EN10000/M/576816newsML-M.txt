Japanese authorities , who just last week were talking down the dollar , shifted gears Monday in an apparent effort to keep its slide from going too far . 
speaking after the dollar fell below 118 yen to its lowest level in nearly four months , a top finance official who earned the monicker &quot; Mr. 
yen &quot; for his influence in markets , told reporters the dollar was likely to &quot; settle down soon . 
the comments by Eisuke Sakakibara , director-general of the Finance Ministry &apos;s International Finance Bureau , were echoed by Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka , top government spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama and Vice Finance Minister Tadashi Ogawa . 
&quot; I think the message of the G7 ( Group of Seven ) nations &apos; agreement on foreign exchange rates is gradually getting through to the market , &quot; said Mitsuzuka , who along with Sakakibara was in Fukuoka , southern Japan , for a meeting of the Asian Development Bank . 
&quot; As a result of the message getting through , it will settle down soon , &quot; he told reporters . 
financial leaders of the G7 -- Japan , the United States , Germany , Britain , France , Italy and Canada -- said in Washington last month that they would monitor exchange rates and cooperate as appropriate . 
they said currency values should reflect fundamentals and that excess volatility was not desirable . 
the market at first shrugged off what was seen as a weak G7 statement , pushing the dollar to a peak of 127.47 yen on May 1 . 
last week , however , Sakakibara jolted jittery markets by saying the yen could rise as far as 103 yen to the dollar , and the U.S. currency &apos;s fall accelerated as speculation spread that it may have turned the corner after a two-year rally . 
Panic-selling in early Asian trade Monday sent the dollar as low as 117.50 yen . 
it then rebounded and was trading at just under 119 yen in late Tokyo trade but worries about further falls overseas remained . 
in New York , the dollar was trading at 118.85 yen at midday , off from Friday &apos;s close of 120.25 . 
Japanese authorities had appeared keen to see the yen strengthen because of U.S. worries that a weak Japanese currency would cause Tokyo &apos;s trade surplus to balloon and spark a new bout of trade friction with Washington . 
but the weak yen has also been a plus for Japan &apos;s economy because of the boost it gives to exports by making them cheaper overseas . 
Shoichiro Toyoda , chairman of the powerful Keidanren business lobby , told a news conference Monday that an exchange rate of 110 to 120 yen to the dollar reflected economic fundamentals . 
Japanese authorities , however , appear to be soft-pedalling their push for a yen rise in hopes of heading off a surge . 
exchange rate forecasts vary considerably , though many agree the future depends not only on Tokyo &apos;s trade surplus but also on interest rate trends in Japan and the United States . 
Japan has kept its interest rates at rock-bottom levels since September 1995 , when it slashed its official discount rate to 0.5 percent to keep its economic recovery on track . 
speculation has emerged that the Bank of Japan may tighten its hyper-easy credit , given signs the economic recovery is gaining momentum , but serious doubts remain whether it will do so quickly . 
comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in New York Friday , meanwhile , have left room for doubt over whether the Fed will raise rates when it next meets on May 20 .
