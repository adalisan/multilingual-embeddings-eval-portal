more than 120 books from the family library of famous American author Mark Twain sold at auction on Wednesday for $ 200,500 , an auction house said . 
the books were bought by Mark Twain House , the mansion in Hartford , Conn. where Twain lived and which is now a museum , auctioneers Butterfield &amp; Butterfield said . 
the auction was held at the auctioneers &apos; premises in San Francisco and Los Angeles via simulcast , they said . 
some of the books contained scrawled notes by Twain , the author of such classics as &quot; Huckleberry Finn &quot; , whose real name was Samuel Clemens . 
the collection included a bible used at Twain &apos;s wedding in 1870 and several presentation copies of books given to Twain by other authors . 
it also included Twain &apos;s personal copy of his 1898 book &quot; More Tramps Abroad &quot; , containing hundreds of penciled notes , and Twain &apos;s copy of Charles Darwin &apos;s &quot; Journal of researches &quot; ( 1890 ) in which Twain wrote : &quot; Can any plausible excuse be furnished for the crime of creating the human race ? 
the library was sold 46 years ago by Clara Clemens , one of Twain &apos;s three daughters , at an auction held at her Hollywood home . 
she had kept the books through many weedings of the original collection because they held special meaning to her and her family , the auctioneers said . 
several of the books contained original drawings by Twain &apos;s wife Livy Clemens . 
Butterfield spokesman Levi Morgan said the seller of the books on Wednesday , a southern California man who wished to remain anonymous , wanted the books sold as a single collection . 
Morgan said the collection sold for well above the pre-sale estimate and the auction house was &quot; quite pleased &quot; with the price achieved .
