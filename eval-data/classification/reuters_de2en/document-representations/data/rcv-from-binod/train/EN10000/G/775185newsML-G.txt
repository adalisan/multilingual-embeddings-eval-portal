Chechen officials on Monday put damages incurred by their breakaway region during its 21-month conflict with Russian troops at 1,500 trillion roubles ( $ 258 billion ) , Interfax news agency said . 
first Deputy Prime Minister Musa Doshukayev said the sum included physical and moral damage to Chechnya &apos;s population and environment and was based on criteria used by the Organisation for Security and Coooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 
&quot; nearly half of the total sum represents moral damages but Chechnya will not insist that they be repaid if it is felt that we are being compensated for the material losses , &quot; Interfax quoted Doshukayev as saying . 
&quot; We have thoroughly studied the Russian constitution and are convinced that by its actions in Chechnya the leadership of the Russian Federation broke 11 statutes concerning human rights , &quot; he added . 
tens of thousands of people died during the Chechen 1994-96 war , which pitted separatist guerrillas against the Russian army . 
Chechnya &apos;s economy and infrastructure remain devastated , despite the signing of a peace pact last August . 
that agreement formally set aside the question of Chechnya &apos;s sovereignty for a five-year period but the territory &apos;s separatist leaders regard their region as already independent . 
as part of the peace deal the Kremlin pledged to plough funds into Chechnya to rebuild its shattered economy but money has been slow in coming . 
last week Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov suspended his ministers &apos; talks with Moscow in a bid to speed up the release of Russian funds . 
the halt of talks at ministerial level might delay negotiations on renovating a pipeline through which oil from new Azeri offshore fields is set to flow to world markets through Russia &apos;s Black Sea port of Novorossiisk this autumn .
