the Lithuanian government said on Wednesday that it would seek amendments to the country &apos;s tax regulations to level the playing field between companies with domestic and foreign capital . 
&quot; It is suggested to stop giving tax advantages to companies in which foreign capital will be invested . 
according to European Union directives all companies should enjoy equal principles , &quot; the government said in a statement . 
companies which have had advantages under Lithuania &apos;s foreign investment law will continue to have this right , the government said . 
Lithuanian law currently states that if foreign investment exceeds $ 2 million , companies are exempt from profit tax for a period of three years and for the next three years pay only 50 percent profit tax . 
the government also proposed a zero tax tariff on profits used for investments , the government said . 
&quot; profit tax is 29 percent but the profit tax used for investment is to be taxed with a zero tariff , &quot; it said .
