House Speaker Newt Gingrich tried on Tuesday to quell turmoil within the Republican Party amid speculation that his third-in-command will resign . 
a spokesman for Republican Whip Tom delay of Texas denied that the Texas lawmaker will step down from his leadership position . 
&quot; He is not resigning , &quot; John Feehery said . 
Gingrich spokeswoman Christina Martin said the Georgia Republican had urged members not to seek a vote on the leadership at Wednesday &apos;s meeting of all 238 Republican lawmakers . 
&quot; It is his preference today not to hold a special conference and that we not challenge the leadership in the next conference , &quot; she told reporters . 
several Republican dissidents had pointed to delay , the third-ranking Republican in the House , as an active participant in meetings two weeks ago to replace Gingrich with a leader who would take a harder line with the White House on budget and tax negotiations . 
in an indication of deepening party intrigue , Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas issued an emotional apology to his colleagues for mistakenly believing that only a small group of dissidents , none of whom were in the House leadership , was responsible for an attempt to oust the speaker . 
&quot; I apologise for my initial belief that the dissidents were solely responsible for starting this mess , &quot; Gingrich deputy Armey said . 
in the two-page letter , Armey affirmed his loyalty to Gingrich and denied publicly for a third time that he had participated in the aborted coup . 
he said Gingrich was well aware that he did not try to &quot; dump &quot; him . 
&quot; Never have I said that I was in favour of any plan to remove the speaker , and no member can truthfully say they ever heard me say that , because I didn &apos;t . 
the House leadership team delayed until Tuesday evening its regular business meeting to discuss the status of tax and budget negotiations and a progress report on the annual spending bills moving through the House , Martin said . 
&quot; The speaker would prefer the leadership stay focused as a united team and not allow one week &apos;s events to stand in the way of success &quot; she said . 
but that might prove difficult . 
a group of second-term Republicans , some of whom were involved in efforts to replace the speaker , were to meet privately Tuesday night . 
the leadership is elected by Republican lawmakers and not appointed by the speaker , nor can it be disbanded by the speaker alone . 
this sophomore class includes many of the most conservative members who were swept into the House in the same political wave that brought the party back into control of that chamber for the first time in 40 years . 
among them are several who met to discuss ousting Gingrich July 10 . 
many of them are also allied closely with delay &apos;s more conservative , confrontational political style . 
this conservative group has urged Gingrich to take a harder line with the White House on taxes and spending as he did during the heyday of the so-called &quot; Republican revolution &quot; of 1995 . 
Republicans will have to deal with the coup attempt eventually , party sources said . 
on Wednesday all House Republicans will gather for the first time since the dissent within the ranks became public , but Gingrich would prefer they focus on pending legislation , Martin said . 
in his letter , Armey acknowledged he had made mistakes in the past two weeks . 
he said he attended one meeting in which &quot; what if &quot; scenarios were discussed based on reports of an uprising against Gingrich . 
he also said he was mistaken to assume no member of the leadership was involved .
