restrictions placed on short-term import financing appear to be having an impact , cutting overseas purchases in the past two months by an estimated $ 867 million , Brazilian officials said Thursday . 
stressing that the figure was merely a preliminary estimate and should not be taken as gospel , Economic Policy Secretary Jose Roberto Mendonca de Barros said there were signs that import financing maturities were lengthening . 
&quot; This is an approximate indicator . 
it &apos;s the first indication , not the last , &quot; Mendonca de Barros told reporters . 
he said Finance Ministry officials calculated that the level of imports previously financed in the short-term , but which had been cancelled because of the new rules imposed in March , reached some $ 867 million between May 13 and June 26 . 
Mendonca de Barros also noted that government figures showed 22.4 percent of all imports were financed with maturities of over a year in May compared to 8.3 percent for the year to date . 
Brazil imposed new rules on March 26 which effectively forced importers to pay in cash or seek financing in excess of 360 days . 
the move provoked an outcry from Mercosur customs union partners Argentina , Paraguay and Uruguay , who were promptly given partial exemptions .
