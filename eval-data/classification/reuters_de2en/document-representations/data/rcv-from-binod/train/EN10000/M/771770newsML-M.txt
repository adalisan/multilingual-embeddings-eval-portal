the rupee dipped against the dollar in early Friday trade on a continuation of corporate demand for the U.S. currency seen on Thursday , dealers said . 
the rupee slipped to 35.72 in latest deals from the opening quote of 35.705 / 710 , dealers said . 
they said two European banks were buying dollars for their corporate clients . 
the chief dealer at a brokerage said the market was rife with rumours that the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) was under pressure to &apos; do something &apos; to pull down the overvalued rupee . 
&quot; This has triggered some importer covering , &quot; he said . 
&quot; What may be encouraging is the fact that there is now a broad consensus about the overvaluation that exists and let us hope something is done about it , &quot; a foreign bank said in its daily foreign exchange commentary . 
the forward dollar market continued to be dull with no major fluctuation in premiums , dealers said .
