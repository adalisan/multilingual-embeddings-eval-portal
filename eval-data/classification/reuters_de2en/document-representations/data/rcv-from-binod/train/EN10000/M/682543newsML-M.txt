Zimbabwe &apos;s industrial index closed firmer on Tuesday largely due to increased demand for some heavyweith counters , shrugging off losses in a number of second-tier shares , brokers said . 
&quot; Industrials saw a wave of activity with selling occuring across the board , probably involving liquidation ahead of the close of ( national dairy ) Dairibord &apos;s public offer this Friday , &quot; one broker said , adding : 
&quot; The market held up reasonably well however , with good demand for the heavy weights holding them firm . 
the day &apos;s advances were in tobacco company Rothmans which put on 100 cents to 4,000 while hotel and retail giant Meikles added 50 cents to 2,800 and blue chip bankers Barclays went up 25 cents to 3,225 . 
rubber product manufacturers Acacia climbed 20 cents to 200 , and multi-industrials TA Holdings at 210 , haulage group Clan at 200 and cable manufacturers Bicaf at 320 were all 10 cents firmer . 
Minings traded largely unchanged and the seven-share index there held steady at 958.19 .
