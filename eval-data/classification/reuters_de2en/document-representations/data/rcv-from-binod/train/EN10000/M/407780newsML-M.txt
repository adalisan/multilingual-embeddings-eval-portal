KCBT hard red winter wheat futures were mostly higher at the midsession on a mixture of commercial- and Fund-related buying in the May contract , traders said . 
Cargill investor Services had bought at least one million May bushels , and traders said this was linked to commercial business . 
commodity brokers E. D. &amp; F. Man International bought 1.5 million May , and Shay grain bought 1.5 million July bushels . 
&quot; Commercial and fund buying has raced us higher , &quot; a KCBT trader said . 
the surge allowed new crop July to climb off its opening lows , which came on ideas that recent moisture should help the HRW wheat crop when it emerges from dormancy . 
March was up 1 / 4 cent at $ 4.19-1 / 2 and July was up three cents at $ 3.76 .
