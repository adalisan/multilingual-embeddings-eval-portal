the Venezuelan government gave final approval Wednesday to a decree that will allow the Central Bank to start issuing Treasury bills alongside its regular Monetary stabilization bills , or TEMs , Information Minister Fernando Egana said . 
the long-awaited Treasury bills , &quot; will strengthen the Central Bank &apos;s financial situation and grant it greater flexibility in the execution of monetary policy , &quot; Egana told reporters after a cabinet meeting of ministers . 
the bills , which will be used to pay off the government &apos;s $ 3.6 billion debt with the Central Bank , add another weapon to the bank &apos;s currently limited portfolio of monetary tools . 
currently the bank is dependent on TEMs for its open market operations . 
the government &apos;s debt with the bank stems from the Brady bond debt restructuring in the early 1990s . 
under original plans , the Central Bank was to issue 450 billion bolivars worth ( $ 925 million ) of Treasury bills this year . 
in subsequent years , bills worth up to 0.75 percent of GDP were to be issued . 
the bills were due to carry maturities of six months to two years with a floating coupon adjusted quarterly . 
Egana did not say whether these conditions had been altered .
