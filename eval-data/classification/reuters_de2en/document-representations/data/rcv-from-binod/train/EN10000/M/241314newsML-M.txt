Singapore shares fell more than two percent on Friday morning after a sharp fall on the Hong Kong stock market . 
Singapore &apos;s benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index had fallen 49.85 points , or 2.25 percent , to 2,164.32 by its lunchtime close at 0430 GMT . 
dealers said investors were worried by overnight comments by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan about &quot; irrational exuberance &quot; in stock markets and also by a fall in U.S. bond markets . 
Greenspan &apos;s remarks were understood by some investors to be a warning that the long rally in U.S. shares might have been overdone and a downward correction might be on its way . 
many dealers had been predicting a fall towards 2,150 points on the Straits Times Industrials Index , but they said the speed of the decline had taken them by surprise . 
&quot; When the U.S. sneezes , we all catch a cold , &quot; said one local dealer . 
&quot; Singapore was following Hong Kong . 
Hong Kong &apos;s Hang Seng Index dropped 569.90 points , or 4.22 percent , to 12,921.66 by the end of its morning session . 
in Singapore , most of the big falls were in blue chips that had gained over the past few days , including banks and several large industrial stocks . 
a total of 378 Singapore stocks registered falls versus only 18 gainers on brisk volume of 100.38 million shares .
