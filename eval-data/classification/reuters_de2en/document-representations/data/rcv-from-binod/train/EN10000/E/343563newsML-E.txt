Ukraine may this year cover its budget deficit without requiring the National Bank of Ukraine to issue direct credits to the government , the central bank chief said on Thursday . 
&quot; It may well be in 1997 that Ukraine will avoid the biggest factor which destabilises prices and the currency -- printing money , &quot; National Bank Chairman Viktor Yushchenko told Reuters . 
he said the 1997 budget draft , which won preliminary approval from parliament in December , foresees raising 3.4 billion hryvnia through internal sources like Treasury bills . 
Ukraine is also planning a Eurobond issue this year . 
although the final deficit figure is still unknown , Ukraine plans to cover the balance of the deficit with foreign credits . 
President Leonid Kuchma has said the budget would be passed by the end of March . 
the constitution states it should have been passed by January 1 . 
last year direct credits covered 1.07 billion hryvnia of the deficit , T-bills paid for 1.5 billion hryvnia , and foreign credits paid for the rest . 
Interfax news agency , quoting parliamentary Budget Committee Chairman Mykola Azarov , said the 1996 deficit had been 3.7 billion hryvnia . 
Ukraine has issued credits to pay for the deficit every year since independence in 1991 . 
Yushchenko said the government appeared to support the proposal .
