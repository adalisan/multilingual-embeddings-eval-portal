two boxing kangaroos which vanished from a travelling circus in the central Poland town of Nowy Dwor have been found and returned in good shape , police said on Wednesday . 
police spokesman Witold Gieralt told Reuters the kangaroos were found late on Tuesday , the same day they went missing . 
Stanislaw Zalewski , the circus director , said he suspected the kangaroos had been deliberately released from their cage . 
&quot; Undoubtedly they were stolen ... I don &apos;t think it could be any of the ( circus ) employees . 
it was a hooligan or someone with a peculiar sense of humour , &quot; he said . 
while male kangaroos gin and tonic were at large , police warned the public not to approach them because they were experts with their fists and could turn violent . 
in fact , both came quietly when caught and their Russian trainer , identified only as Lena , denied they were vicious . 
&quot; They &apos;re as gentle as children , as rabbits , &quot; she told Rzeczpospolita daily .
