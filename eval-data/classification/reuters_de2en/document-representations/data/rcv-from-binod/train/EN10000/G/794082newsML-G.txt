hospitals which educate physicians as part of their business may achieve lower death rates among patients with major illnesses than those that do not , according to a report published on Tuesday . 
the finding was based on a review of nearly 90,000 patients in the Cleveland area who were treated at various teaching and non-teaching hospitals for stroke , heart attack , pneumonia and other conditions . 
&quot; We found that the risk of death was 19 percent lower in major teaching hospitals , compared with non-teaching hospitals , and that the length of stay was generally 10 percent lower , &quot; said the report published in this week &apos;s Journal of the American Medical Association . 
major teaching hospitals are considered to be more expensive -- and thus less attractive to insurance coverage in today &apos;s managed care environment -- because they sponsor research , offer a broad range of services and often treat large numbers of poor patients . 
the study from Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland said the findings &quot; highlight the importance of such hospitals in individual care &quot; and the potential problems with &quot; purchasing decisions that shift hospital utilization patterns away from major teaching hospitals ... &quot; 
questions about the study were aired by Lisa Iezzoni of the Harvard Medical School , Boston , in an editorial in the same issue of the journal . 
she said comparing death rates was a &quot; blunt instrument &quot; with which to make quality assessments and cited one study which indicated some patients near death may prefer nearby community ( non-teaching ) hospitals when desiring end-of-life comfort care . 
nonetheless , she said , society must continue to support major teaching hospitals &quot; for the greater good &quot; and find ways to make the facilities operate more efficiently .
