delays in abolishing exchange controls and fears of higher interest rates sank South African industrial shares for the ninth consecutive session on Tuesday while government bonds tumbled to a five-month low . 
analysts and dealers said the Johannesburg Stock Exchange ( JSE ) has lost over three percent of its value since the end of October as investors hover on the sidelines , scared of being burnt by further rand devaluation . 
&quot; There is a change of view that the exchange rate is under pressure due to the Reserve Bank &apos;s policy of not letting go ( of exchange controls ) , &quot; said Gad Ariovich , investment strategy manager at stockbroker SMK Securities . 
reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals on Friday ruled out a one-off or &quot; big-bang &quot; approach to abolishing controls , saying it would be a gradual process which could take four to five years . 
foreign investors , who account for over 50 percent of the JSE &apos;s turnover , were especially loathe to re-enter the market in the wake of the latest comments on controls , dealers said . 
&quot; Overseas people are not interested in buying South African stocks at the moment until there is some stability in the rand , &quot; said the head of a leading investment house . 
&quot; And the perception is that there is not going to be stability until exchange controls go . 
the rand has lost some 30 percent of its value against the dollar this year . 
it was last trading around 4.70 to the U.S. unit , off its worst ever level of 4.77 hit two weeks ago . 
but dealers said the currency remained vulnerable to further speculative attacks given the country &apos;s low reserves . 
at the same time , stocks and bonds have been pounded by fears of an interest rate hike as the daily money market shortage shoots up , held above the nine billion rand ( $ 1.9 billion ) by a liquidity crunch as investors shun South African assets . 
yields on South Africa &apos;s key R150 long bond on Tuesday jumped above 16.20 percent for the first time since the end of May . 
short-term money market rates are now discounting more than a one percentage point rise in South African lending rates -- already among the highest in the world at 11 percent , after taking account of inflation . 
fears of a further upward move in the key Bank rate , currently 16 percent , and commercial banks &apos; prime rate , 19.25 percent , has taken its toll on consumers and in turn on consumer-related companies &apos; profits . 
Worse-than-expected half-year results have recently been posted by companies which have fingered slowing domestic demand for their woes . 
Carmen Maynard , managing director of Fleming Marting Asset Management said : &quot; The natural progression for me is the weaker rand threatening higher interest rates threatening a slower economy threatening weaker corporate profits . 
the outlook for the stock and bond market in 1997 remains bleak amid predictions of a further slowdown in growth in gross domestic product to between two and 2.5 percent , from an expected three percent this year and 3.3 percent in 1995 . 
that paints a bleak picture for the JSE , according to Sandra Gordon , economist with fund manager Syfrets . 
&quot; The anticipated slowdown in the domestic economy is expected to cap the market &apos;s upside , &quot; she predicted this week .
