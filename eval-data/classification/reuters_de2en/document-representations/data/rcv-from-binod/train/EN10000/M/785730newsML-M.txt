sterling volatilities were sharply higher ahead of the outcome of today &apos;s Bank of England monetary policy committee meeting . 
&quot; Opinion on whether UK rates will be raised is pretty divided now and in any case the market is expecting a lot of volatility . 
this has seen prices up but not a lot of activity today , &quot; said a U.S. bank dealer . 
spot sterling was steadier against the dollar and mark after Wednesday &apos;s sell-off but vols were marked up ahead of today &apos;s announcement . 
one-month cable Vol stood at 10.1 / 10.4 percent against 8.85 / 9.15 percent Wednesday and sterling / mark Vol was trading at 11.4 / 11.7 from 10.6 / 11.1 percent . 
dollar option volatilities were trading lower at the European midsession , tracking spot &apos;s consolidation from Wednesday &apos;s highs . 
dealers said dollar spot &apos;s failure to hold Wednesday &apos;s key levels -- 1.89 in dollar / mark and 119 in dollar / yen -- prompted a retracement in volatility as the market sees tighter ranges into the weekend . 
&quot; Vols were getting pretty rich yesterday so it wasn &apos;t too surprising to see some of that froth getting sold-off , &quot; said a UK bank dealer . 
&quot; But there &apos;s no sign yet of a reversal in trend , vols still look well-bid . 
one-month dollar / mark volatility stood at 11.5 / 11.75 percent against 11.65 / 12.00 late Wednesday . 
the risk reversal , the difference in implied volatility between calls relative to puts , was steady at 0.5 / 0.8 percent for mark puts . 
dollar / yen &apos;s spot dip below 119 also saw vols trading lower with one-month now at 11.5 / 11.8 percent from 12.4 / 12.7 Wednesday . 
one-year vols also came off to 12.3 / 12.5 versus 12.7 / 13.2 percent . 
mark / yen &apos;s downtrend continued , pushing to a new two-year low in early trade which served to push vols ever higher . 
the one-month ticked up to 11.5 / 12.0 percent from 11.3 / 11.7 .
