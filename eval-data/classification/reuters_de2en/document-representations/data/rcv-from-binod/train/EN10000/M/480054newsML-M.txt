Irish bonds slumped after the long Easter break on Tuesday in line with other European markets gloomy over fears of a further hike in U.S. interest rates , dealers said . 
the NAPM index read 55.0 in March against 53.1 in February and above forecasts of 53.6 . 
&quot; I think players now accept that we &apos;re in a bear phase - the question is , how long will it last ? 
&quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; All eyes will be looking to U.S. data for clues , especially the non-farm payroll numbers due on Friday . 
the market was resigned to a strong figure , with a rise of around 180,000 expected , dealers said . 
&quot; The average earnings figure will be important - if it drops back it may be enough to stabilize things , if it goes up , we could be looking at a severe sell-off , &quot; a dealer said . 
dealers said bond yields had risen by five to seven basis points across the curve in response to international gloom on markets fearing that a further rate hike may be deemed necessary to rein in a surging U.S. economy . 
by 1600 GMT , the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was down 15 pence from Thursday &apos;s close at 100.88 to yield 6.26 percent while the key benchmark eight percent bond due 2006 was down 37 pence from the close at 106.88 to yield 6.96 percent . 
dealers said the market had been quiet since some light selling early in the session . 
looking ahead , dealers said , domestic borrowing figures for the first quarter , due from the Department of Finance later this week , could be interesting . 
&quot; They ( the figures ) may not be market-moving but it &apos;ll be interesting to see whether the borrowing requirement has fallen and whether the department says anything about what they suggest , &quot; a dealer said . 
the market is also awaiting monetary statistics from the Central Bank on Thursday . 
&quot; The size of forex reserves will tell us the degree of central bank intervention in February , always a useful indicator , &quot; a dealer said .
