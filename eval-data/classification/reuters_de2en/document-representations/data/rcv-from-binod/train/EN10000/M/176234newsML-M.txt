Shenzhen &apos;s B share index closed lower on Friday due in part to the poor debut of Chongqing Changan Automobile , brokers said . 
the index edged down 0.44 points or 0.50 percent to close at 88.90 points on turnover of HK $ 27.40 million , compared with HK $ 12.79 million for the previous session . 
the stock became the first Shenzhen B share this year to end below the issue price on its first day of trading . 
brokers said the stock was depressed by unexpected overseas institutional selling and one analyst suggested it could be a reflection of the poor performance of the Shanghai B share market , which has hit record closing lows in four of the past five sessions . 
the miserable debut reflected waning confidence of foreign investors in China &apos;s B share market with domestic investors banned from trading in foreign currency shares , brokers said . 
Changan &apos;s decline weighed on market sentiment and triggered selling in other stocks , they said . 
Shenzhen &apos;s A share index rallied after three straight days of losses . 
it fell 4.26 points , or 1.14 percent , to end at 378.12 , with turnover expanding to 6.71 billion yuan from 5.18 billion yuan . 
the composite index gained 3.77 points , or 1.08 percent , to 352.00 points . 
Dalian Bohai Hotel ( Group ) Co Ltd floated 12.50 million A shares in Shenzhen on Friday and closed the session at 12.00 yuan per share against an offer price of 5.00 yuan . 
chemical fibre maker Kunshan Sanshan put in the worst performance , plunging 0.85 yuan , or 8.95 percent , to 8.65 yuan on sustained profit-taking , brokers said .
