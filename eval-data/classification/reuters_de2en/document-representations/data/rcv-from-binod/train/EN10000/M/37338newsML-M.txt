heating oil prices led petroleum markets higher Friday on worries about low stocks heading into the winter , and soybean prices rose on worries about dry weather hurting the late-developing crop . 
at the New York Mercantile Exchange , heating oil prices ended with steep gains stoked by supply concerns . 
October heating oil rose 1.37 cents a gallon to close at 66.40 cents . 
&quot; The reason heating oil outperformed was on the legitimate concern that supplies are tight here and in Europe , &quot; said Tom Bentz , a trader with ING Derivatives . 
the American Petroleum Institute this week estimated that U.S. stocks of distillates used to produce heating oil were 14 percent below year ago , and traders said they expect upcoming diesel exports to further tighten supply . 
the crude oil market also received another shot in the arm the Paris-based International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , an industry watchdog , revised down its oil supply estimate for the rest of this year . 
IEA pegged supply from producers outside the Organisation of the Petroleum exporting Countries ( OPEC ) downwards by 300,000 barrels per day for the second half of 1996 . 
&quot; There is clearly higher demand and lower than expected non-OPEC output combined with the loss of Iraqi oil , &quot; said Stephen O &apos;Sullivan of MC Securities Ltd. in London . 
the oil market moved sharply higher after Iraqi troops moved into Iraqi Kurdistan last week , prompting the United Nations to freeze an oil-for-food deal with Iraq . 
under a May 20 agreement , sanctions-hit Iraq would have been allowed limited oil sales worth $ 2 billion for six months to pay for food and medicines . 
the U.N. imposed an embargo on Iraqi oil after Iraq &apos;s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 . 
October crude oil settled 41 cents higher at $ 23.85 a barrel . 
October gasoline ended up 0.86 cent at 65.27 cents a gallon . 
at the Chicago Board of Trade , soybean prices jumped higher for a second straight day amid worries about dry weather . 
November soybeans closed up 4-1 / 4 cents a bushel at $ 8 , a six-week high . 
there had been ideas that rains from Hurricane Fran could aid dry soybean and corn areas in the eastern Corn Belt states like Ohio . 
but meteorologists on Friday altered the forecasts , predicting only light showers for the Midwest in coming days . 
&quot; It &apos;s still dry and there is some concern about that , &quot; said Ron Kucha of O &apos;Connor and Co . 
soybeans and corn are in the final stages of growth from Ohio to Nebraska and the plants need moisture for filling of corn kernels and soybean pods . 
December corn futures closed 2-1 / 4 cents per bushel lower at $ 3.32-1 / 2 , with commercial selling cited by traders as corn harvesting continued in the southern United States . 
at the New York Cotton Exchange December cotton closed 0.54 cent per pound higher at 74.18 cents in sympathy with soybeans . 
both crops are processed to produce industrial oils . 
traders were also positioning themselves for next Wednesday &apos;s monthly world crop estimates from the Agriculture Department , with hopes for Chinese demand underpinning prices . 
&quot; The big question is whether China will be in the market for more than a milion bales of U.S. cotton , &quot; said Carl Anderson , a cotton marketing specialist with Texas A &amp; M University .
