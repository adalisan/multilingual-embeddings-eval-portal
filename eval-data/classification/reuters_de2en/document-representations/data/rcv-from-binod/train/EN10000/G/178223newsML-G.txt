England scored a decisive 2-0 win over Georgia with goals from Teddy Sheringham and Les Ferdinand to maintain their 100 per cent record in their World Cup qualifying campaign on Saturday . 
England &apos;s well-deserved victory in their 100th World Cup match since they first entered the tournament in 1950 , was also their third win in three games under new manager Glenn Hoddle . 
they now have a maximum nine points from their opening three games and lead group two by three points from Italy , who have six points from two . 
Georgia &apos;s second straight defeat looked likely as early as the 15th minute when Sheringham scored with a well-taken shot , from the right-hand side of the penalty area , that took a deflection off Georgia defender Kakhi Tskhadadze before looping over goalkeeper Irakli Zoidze . 
England made it 2-0 after 36 minutes when Paul Gascoigne , picked by Hoddle despite off-field problems which include beating-up his wife , linked up with Sheringham who set Ferdinand away on a bustling run through the middle . 
Ferdinand , partnered by Sheringham -- restored to the attack because of the absence of unfit skipper Alan Shearer -- brushed past an ineffectual challenge from Tskhadadze before blasting the ball past Zoidze with a powerful left-foot shot from 12 metres . 
Georgia , full of some excellent technical skills and sweet passing moves in midfield , seemed to lack the heart or commitment to really threaten England , who dominated the match for long periods and subdued a passionate , but ultimately frustrated home crowd of around 76,000 . 
Georgia &apos;s best chances came early in the game and a brief period before half-time when they attempted to get a goal back before the interval . 
after six minutes England &apos;s new three-man defensive system found themselves in trouble when Temur Ketsbiai stole the ball from Gareth Southgate and fed it through to Shota Arveladze , whose 20-metre dipping shot went just over England goalkeeper David seaman &apos;s crossbar . 
five minutes later Tskhadadze headed over from a corner taken by Gerogi Kinkladze who plays for Manchester City in England . 
but apart from that Georgia rarely troubled England whose only black mark was a 70th-minute booking for David Beckham for a tackle from behind .
