separatist tribal guerrillas have killed at least 15 people , including two policemen , in outbreaks of violence in the northeastern state of Manipur , state police said on Wednesday . 
police said Kuki tribals killed eight Naga tribesmen in Singtam village and another five in Zou Veng in Churchandpur district , some 45 km ( 28 miles ) south of the state capital Imphal . 
ten Naga tribals were injured in the attacks , which occurred on Tuesday . 
two soldiers were killed in an ambush in Rengpang in Tamenglong district , which is under strict curfew , police said . 
the Nagas and the Kukis began fighting in mid-1992 for control of a highway which authorities say tribals use to transport drugs to neighbouring Burma . 
authorities say $ 1 billion worth of drugs is transported every year along the road , which was once firmly under the control of Kukis before the Nagas laid claim to it .
