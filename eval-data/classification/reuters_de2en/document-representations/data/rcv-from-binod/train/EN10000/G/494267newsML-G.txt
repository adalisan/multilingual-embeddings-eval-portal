South Africa on Tuesday criticised the proposed expansion of NATO as well as enhanced nuclear defence programmes in Europe because they would spread rather than dismantle nuclear materials . 
&quot; The planned expansion of NATO would entail an increase in the number of non-nuclear weapon states which participate in nuclear training , planning and decision-making and which have an element of nuclear deterrence in their defence policies , &quot; South Africa &apos;s U.N. ambassador K.J. 
Jele said . 
South Africa would &quot; like to place on record our concern about the non-proliferation implications of the plans for the expansion of NATO and the proposals which have been made for a dialogue in Europe on the future role of nuclear deterrence in the context of the European defence policy , &quot; he said . 
NATO plans to invite several former Communist Warsaw Pact states to join the alliance at a July summit in Madrid . 
the favourites are Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic . 
the United States has stressed it will not accept any deal that gives candidate states in central Europe second-class status . 
but at the same time NATO has said that no nuclear weapons would be based on the soil of any new members . 
Jele fired an opening shot at a review process for the nuclear Non-Profileration treaty ( NPT ) . 
South Africa wants the conference to begin negotiating a treaty binding nuclear weapons states never to use these arms against a state without atomic weapons . 
an indefinite extension of the NPT was agreed in 1995 as part of a package that included an annual review of the treaty and a committment by nuclear weapons states to reduce atomic arms with the ultimate goal of eliminating them . 
parties to the treaty are meeting in New York this week for the first time since 1995 to outline commitments before the next review of the treaty in the year 2000 , at which time more specific guarantees are expected from nuclear powers . 
the NTP essentially represents a bargain between the world &apos;s five declared nuclear powers -- the United States , Russia , France , Britain and China -- and other nations . 
non-nuclear states pledge not to develop atomic weapons but are given access to nuclear technology for civilian uses . 
the treaty also contains a disarmament pledge . 
South Africa , the only country to build a secret arsenal of nuclear weapons and then dismantle them , was responsible for forging the compromise that led to an indefinite extension of the treaty in 1995 . 
much of Tuesday &apos;s debate concentrated on what the NPT review conference could discuss -- and which parts overlapped into other forums . 
the meeting ends on Friday . 
&quot; The South Africans have to be taken seriously or countries are trashing the NPT , &quot; said Daniel Plesch , director of the British-American Security Information Council , a research group . 
&quot; The Western powers are refusing to guarantee not to use their nuclear weapons against countries without the bomb while guaranteeing that they will now use their nuclear weapons to defend Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic , &quot; he said .
