implied volatilities for dollar / mark options remained well bid near Friday &apos;s closing levels in thin dealings as market participants paused to reassess dollar direction in light of last week &apos;s pullback . 
profit taking on long dollar positions pumped up dollar / mark vols in a hurry over the past several sessions , and now many traders and investors are sidelined awaiting U.S. and German central bank meetings this week before stepping back into the fray , said an options dealer for a European bank . 
many weak dollar longs have been shaken out , and a tendency to close positions at any hint of further weakness remains , the dealer said . 
one-month dollar / mark volatility was 11.5 / 11.8 percent , about two-tenths higher than levels late Friday but up about three-quarters of a point from earlier in that day , traders said . 
Vols rose while the dollar swooned along with a 247-point dive in the Dow Jones Industrial average . 
in view of spot dollar / mark &apos;s healthy correction , to 1.827 marks currently from an August 6 peak of 1.8913 , there continues to be good interest in buying low-delta &quot; wings &quot; comprising out of the money options , traders said . 
the interest in such far-out strikes as 1.70 or 1.90 marks suggests more large moves are anticipated for the spot , the traders said . 
keen attention to U.S. asset prices began to subside through the morning as those markets found their footing , said a Wall Street-based forex options dealer . 
the Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday to consider U.S. monetary policy , with the Bundesbank &apos;s interest rate meeting set for Thursday . 
although neither is expected to yield a change in interest rates , dollar-pair vols should continue to garner support while the meetings remain the main focus for the cash market . 
&quot; The meetings will provide more pieces of the puzzle , but fairly small pieces , &quot; said the European bank trader . 
risk reversals for dollar / mark continue to whip around amid heightened sensitivity to spot movements , traders said . 
the one-month 25-delta risk reversal in the early afternoon was pegged at flat / 0.2 , slightly in favor of mark calls . 
dollar / yen vols were also holding firm , up more than half a point at 12.4 / 12.7 percent in one-month options . 
the dollar / yen risk reversal , or put / call pricing differential , was 0.2 / 0.4 skewed for yen puts .
