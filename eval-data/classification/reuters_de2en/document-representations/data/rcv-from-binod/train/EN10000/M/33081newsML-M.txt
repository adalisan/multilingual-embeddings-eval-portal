U.S. Plains cattle markets early Wednesday were quiet , with no sales reported , feedlot sources said . 
a few packer bids were reported at $ 69.00 per cwt , but owners continued to price cattle at $ 71.00 to $ 72.00 , fully anticipating $ 70.00 sales this week . 
&quot; Let a packer bid $ 70.00 , and he &apos;ll get covered up with cattle , &quot; one west Texas feedlot operator said . 
last week &apos;s top price was $ 69.00 , but feedlot cattle prices were expected to be lifted by light supplies of finished cattle and expectations for firm beef prices . 
boxed beef prices were expected to be supported by strong demand amid talk that retail beef inventories got cleaned up during the three-day holiday weekend , market sources said . 
with beef prices set to rebound from last week &apos;s decline , cattle sales could be seen later Wednesday or on Thursday , according to feedlot sources . 
&quot; We could be fixing to see some excitement by the end of the week , &quot; one cattle feeder said .
