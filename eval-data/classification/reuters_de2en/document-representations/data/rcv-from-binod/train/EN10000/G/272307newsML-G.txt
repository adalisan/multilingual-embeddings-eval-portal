a Pakistani court gave police another four days on Sunday to interrogate ousted prime minister Benazir Bhutto &apos;s husband Asif Ali Zardari in custody about the alleged murder of her estranged brother . 
Zardari &apos;s lawyer Farooq Naik said the court gave the extension overruling his objections . 
Zardari was re-arrested on Thursday on suspicion of involvement in the killing of Bhutto &apos;s younger brother Murtaza as soon as he was released from a Karachi jail following a court ruling that his six-week detention was illegal . 
on Saturday , Zardari told a magistrate he had been falsely implicated in the murder case of a person he had always respected and that he feared police would poison him . 
Naik said the court , on his request , had ordered a thorough check of Zardari &apos;s food because of a &quot; serious threat &quot; to his life . 
Murtaza &apos;s Lebanese-born widow Ghinwa , now chief of a breakaway faction of Bhutto &apos;s Pakistan People &apos;s Party ( PPP ) , has accused Zardari , former home minister Naseerullah Babar , former chief minister Abdullah Shah and police of conspiring the September 20 killing of her husband in a police shootout near his Karachi home . 
police say Murtaza was killed in crossfire after his bodyguards fired first at police . 
a judicial tribunal is already investigating the incident , which Bhutto says was a conspiracy against her family and government . 
her government was sacked on November 5 by President Leghari on disputed charges of corruption and misrule . 
Murtaza returned from 16 years in exile in 1993 and last year set up a breakaway faction of the PPP .
