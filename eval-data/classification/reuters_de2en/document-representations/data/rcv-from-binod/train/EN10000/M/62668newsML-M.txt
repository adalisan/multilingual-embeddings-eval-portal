takeover target Wilson and Horton eased on solid volume on Wednesday as New Zealand shares closed weaker after trading a narrow range . 
the publishing group shed 10 cents to close at $ 10.65 , still comfortably above the $ 10.50 / share offer price from Irish-based Independent Newspapers plc . 
the fall was on volume of 684,000 shares , nearly 10 times Tuesday &apos;s turnover , with parcels of up to 100,000 going through . 
new Zealand &apos;s other media stock , INL , eased eight cents to $ 5.82 after a strong ride up on Tuesday in sympathy with W &amp; H. 
Fletcher Challenge &quot; letter stocks &quot; were mainly firmer , with Paper up three at $ 2.83 , Forest up two at $ 2.00 and Building two cents firmer at $ 3.33 . 
Philip Solarz at Doyle Paterson Brown said the latter may have more to do with a current roadshow in Britain than the announcement that OLS Asia Holdings Ltd was buying selected Asian construction assets of Fletcher Challenge . 
market leader Telecom shed three cents to $ 6.91 as the NZSE-40 capital index fell 3.95 points to 2,234.95 . 
brokers said the market was in a holding pattern in the run up to a general election on October 12 . 
&quot; You might just start to see those volumes drop off over the next two or three weeks , at least until the election , &quot; Solarz said .
