June T-bond futures will look for support at 108-30 on Friday , but risk a drop lower if that fails , technical analysts said . 
the 108-30 was the low on May 8 and also on Thursday . 
&quot; The contract went through 109-00 yesterday , but bounced at 108-30 , &quot; said Gerry Celaya , senior technical analyst at American Express Bank in London . 
June T-bonds were trading at 109-07 at 1025 GMT , 5 / 32 above the Chicago settlement price . 
Philippe Cahen , technical analyst at Credit Lyonnais in Paris , also found support for T-bonds at 108-31 . 
Cahen said the lower boundary of Bollinger bands on an hourly basis offered the market a good prop at this level . 
Bollinger bands are lines drawn at standard deviations around the price action , to give support and resistance . 
on a daily basis , Cahen put support at 108-25 . 
&quot; If we break 108-25 we must watch this level very carefully , as the market could go much lower , &quot; he said . 
he said the problem was there was not much support for T-bonds between that level and 106-08 . 
Celaya found further support for the contract at 108-12 , the low on April 30 . 
on the upside , Cahen said Bollinger band resistance comes in at 109-09 . 
&quot; The next resistance after that is the daily moving average of Bollingers at the 109-23 level , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But I think it will be very difficult to go towards this level today . 
Celaya found resistance for the contract at 109-13 , and at the 109-18 / 20 area . 
September Eurodollar futures were at 93.965 in automated trade at 1042 GMT , up 0.01 .
