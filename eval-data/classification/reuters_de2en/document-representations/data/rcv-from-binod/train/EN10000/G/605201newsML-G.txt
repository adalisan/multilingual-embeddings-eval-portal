the network says a resolution was reached in its termination case with the former current affairs host , with an agreement to pay her one-point-two million dollars . 
Ms Wendt had been seeking more than six-million dollars in damages for the termination of her contract as host of Seven &apos;s &apos; Witness &apos; program .

welfare organisations are applauding a move by the Federal Government to sever a link between the unemployment rate and emergency payments to families in crisis . 
previously the Government used the jobless rate formula to allocate more than 22-million dollars a year to welfare agencies for cash grants and food vouchers for people in temporary hardship . 
but after extensive consultation , the Government &apos;s decided to link relief funding to inflation , because it saw jobless figures as too volatile to be used as a reliable guide to emergency relief needs .
