Vietnam applauded on Thursday the work of Cambodia &apos;s Foreign Minister Ung Huot , a day after he was backed by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen as a successor to ousted Khmer leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh . 
foreign Ministry spokesman , Tran Quang Hoan , told a news briefing in Hanoi that as a neighbouring country Vietnam wanted the Cambodian people to enjoy stability for national development . 
asked about Hun Sen &apos;s decision to support the appointment of Ung Huot as Cambodia &apos;s new first prime minister , he said it was an internal affair of the Cambodian people , but added that Vietnam appreciated his work . 
&quot; In his capacity as Cambodian foreign minister , Mr Ung Huot has contributed much to the consolidation of the friendship and cooperative relations between the countries , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We appreciate his contribution . 
Hanoi has been careful to avoid outright expressions of support for Cambodia &apos;s Hun Sen since he ousted Ranariddh in a coup earlier this month . 
but it broke ranks with other members of the Association of South East Asian Nations earlier this week and expressed support for Cambodia &apos;s early membership of the organisation , despite having agreed to a consensus decision just days earlier to delay it . 
Ung Huot was chosen on Wednesday by remnants of the royalist FUNCINPEC party as a successor to Ranariddh . 
he later received Hun Sen &apos;s backing . 
but the United States said there was no evidence the party had elected him on a free and democratic basis and refused to recognise the position . 
Hanoi &apos;s relations with Cambodia and Hun Sen came under the spotlight in the wake of the coup , after it emerged that Hun Sen had been in Vietnam just days ahead of the violence . 
Hun Sen was the head of the Hanoi-backed government installed following Vietnam &apos;s 1978 invasion . 
Vietnam has denied any involvement in recent developments in Cambodia and reacted with anger to Khmer Rouge claims that it had colluded with Hun Sen to oust Ranariddh .
