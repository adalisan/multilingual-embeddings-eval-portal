world feed barley prices stabilized in the last month on firm Saudi Arabian import demand , a Canadian Wheat Board market analyst said . 
&quot; Feed barley prices have stabilized in the past month primarily due to some very strong demand from Saudi Arabia . 
they &apos;re projected to import about five million tonnes of barley which would account for 50 percent of world feed barley trade . 
that &apos;s up quite a bit from last year , &quot; CWB analyst Larry Sawatzky said . 
Saudi Arabia traditionally buys about 40 percent of 
the world &apos;s feed barley supply . 
some industry participants expected a slight decline from last month &apos;s range . 
&quot; Malting barley prices are the only ones that are down and we lowered them because Australia &apos;s crop quality prospects look very good and they &apos;re expecting very high selection rates , so their exportable supplies of malting barley should be higher than earlier expectations , &quot; Sawatzky added .
