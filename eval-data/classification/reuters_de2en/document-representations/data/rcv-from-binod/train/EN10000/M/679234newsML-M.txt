NASDAQ shares dropped Monday , after a decline in the Dow industrials and bonds , traders said . 
the Nasdaq composite index lost 12.77 points or 0.88 percent to close unofficially at 1434.33 . 
NASDAQ shares traded as high as 1451.07 , approaching a new record high , but later lost steam as the Dow industrials dropped 192 points to 7604 . 
&quot; It &apos;s mostly in sympathy with the Dow . 
once the Dow kept sliding , the Nasdaq couldn &apos;t hold on to its gains , &quot; said Patrick Davis , head of over-the-counter trading at Salomon Brothers . 
the Dow industrials dropped in a wave profit-taking sparked by comments from the Japanese Prime Minister about the potential sale of U.S. government securities by Japan , traders said . 
&quot; pretty much everything was down . 
the big tech names , which trade almost like blue chips , had a hard holding on to last week &apos;s gains when there &apos;s so much pressure on today , &quot; another trader said . 
declining issues beat gainers , 2402 to 1977 , on total volume of nearly 563 million shares . 
NASDAQ shares have showed gains in seven of the previous 10 sessions .
