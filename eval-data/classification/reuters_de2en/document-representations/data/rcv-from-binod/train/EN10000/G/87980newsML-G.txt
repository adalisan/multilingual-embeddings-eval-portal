three years after President Boris Yeltsin blasted parliament with tanks to put down a rebellion by hardline opponents , the scars on Russian democracy remain and communists are showing signs of going back on the offensive . 
the &quot; October events &quot; , in which more than 120 people were killed , crushed Yeltsin &apos;s main political foes at the time -- fiery parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov and former vice president Alexander Rutskoi . 
but they also undermined faith in Russia &apos;s young democratic institutions and laid the foundations for an opposition revival that had looked set to take revenge through the ballot box this summer until Yeltsin launched his victorious reelection bid . 
I don &apos;t like to remember it , &quot; a wistful Khasbulatov told Reuters , drawing on his pipe as he cast his mind back to the October events . 
&quot; Why was the coup carried out ? 
&quot; he asked . 
&quot; Unfortunately , the approach of the &quot; Yeltsinites &apos; was very primitive . 
they considered that it was worth concentrating all power in the hands of one man , that reforms would proceed and everything would be fine , &quot; he said . 
&quot; That is a dangerously misleading road . 
Yeltsin said the storming of the White House parliament , witnessed by millions on live television , was necessary to prevent communists and neo-fascists seizing power . 
his tanks moved in on October 3 only after a bloody assault by anti-Yeltsin forces on Moscow &apos;s Ostankino television centre . 
the showdown with the legislature , where rebel deputies and their supporters were holed up , followed a two-year stand-off in which Yeltsin accused it of blocking his reforms . 
Khasbulatov , who spent almost five months in Moscow &apos;s Lefortovo prison for his role in the events , painted a picture of three years of political and economic decay since then . 
the 54-year-old former economics professor said another consequence was the 21-month war in Chechnya , which started just over a year later when Yeltsin ordered Russian troops to crush the region &apos;s independence drive . 
&quot; The first shot on the White House was the first shot of the Chechnya war , &quot; he said . 
Khasbulatov , an ethnic Chechen now working as an adviser to separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev , is no longer active in Russian politics . 
but new opposition figures have emerged , notably Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov . 
Zyuganov , 52 , was defeated by Yeltsin in the July 3 election , but Yeltsin , 65 , barely made it across the finishing line before heart trouble laid him low . 
the communists have now seized on the health issue and urged Yeltsin to resign in what Russian commentators have described as a new election campaign . 
Yeltsin , who is preparing for heart surgery later this year , might be unable to resume normal work for another four months . 
the events of 1993 showed just how intense and demanding Russian politics can be . 
they came only two years after Yeltsin faced down an attempted coup by communist hardliners against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev . 
but , while Yeltsin &apos;s popularity surged after he stood on a tank to rally resistance in August 1991 , the reaction to his conflict with parliament three years ago was largely one of dismay . 
it caused great soul-searching even among liberals . 
Gennady Burbulis , a former close aide of Yeltsin who stood by him in 1991 , described the October events as a tragedy . 
&quot; I have always said that October 1993 was a tragic event for the political history of Russia , &quot; he said . 
&quot; At the same time , this tragedy taught us a lot and I hope that there is no one in Russia &apos;s political elite today who wishes to resolve internal political problems this way . 
Burbulis , who heads the Strategy think-tank , said Russia &apos;s present political system , with a constitution weighted heavily in favour of presidential rule , took root in that month and failed to meet today &apos;s democratic requirements . 
Burbulis , a member of parliament , said Yeltsin &apos;s health problems had unpredictable consequences for his future . 
&quot; We can only wish him a recovery , but we must understand that Russia has opened a new presidential campaign and nothing good will come of this for the country or the people . 
when asked about the state of democracy in Russia , he thought for a moment and replied : &quot; Constant development .
