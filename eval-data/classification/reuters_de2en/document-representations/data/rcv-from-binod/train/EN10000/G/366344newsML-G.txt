soccer &apos;s world governing body FIFA plans to limit the time goalkeepers have to get the ball back into play but make it legal for them to move on the line before a penalty . 
FIFA general secretary Sepp Blatter said on Monday that the governing body would discuss the changes to the rules at a meeting on March 1 . 
quite the opposite . 
they have it hard enough . 
but FIFA wants to stop them getting away with wasting so much time , &quot; Blatter wrote in a column for the German football magazine Kicker . 
&quot; Too often you notice a goalkeeper because he is standing still rather than moving . 
he catches the ball , strokes it , holds it tightly , waves at all the other players that they should leave him alone with his private property , lets a few more seconds tick by , looks around a bit more and then he finally gets rid of it , &quot; he said . 
&quot; In all that , 10 seconds , sometimes 20 seconds , are lost , &quot; said Blatter , adding that FIFA was thinking of limiting goalkeepers to five seconds . 
in return &apos; keepers will now be allowed to move on the line before a penalty kick which is presently against the rules but very common , he said .
