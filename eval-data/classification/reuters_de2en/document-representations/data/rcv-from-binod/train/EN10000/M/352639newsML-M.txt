Brent crude futures in Asia were lower in late afternoon dealings on SIMEX Monday , as traders further exploited the downside following Friday &apos;s weakness . 
Brent for March was last traded at $ 22.45 per barrel , by-passing support at $ 22.50 and down seven cents from London . 
brokers said the market was moving to test the downside once again , with long-term support at $ 22.00 the target for the bears . 
they said profit-taking on long positions and the weakness of products futures was keeping the crude under pressure . 
one broker said resistance was around $ 22.75 , but he would expect heavy selling should the market try to rebound and test that level . 
product weakness was being driven by latest forecasts of less severe weather in the U.S. northeast , undermining a spell of buying support last week . 
March heating oil on access was last traded at 65.55 cents per gallon , down 0.61 from New York where the contract had dropped 1.90 .
