German shares closed bourse trade weaker on Friday , but off the session &apos;s lows after comments by Bundesbank council members suggested further interest rate cuts could not be ruled out . 
speaking at separate events , Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing and council member Ernst Welteke stressed there was no need to cut rates now , but held out hope that the central bank could consider a further easing . 
the comments led to a firming of the dollar against the mark and encouraged the German bond market , which had dropped on Wednesday after Issing said rates were at an historic low and &quot; nothing more is to be expected or necessary . 
lower interest rates , a sign that inflation is under control , are positive for bond markets and also encourage shares , as credit becomes cheaper for companies .
