Bank of Boston Corp has revised its recommended Ecuador debt allocation to neutral from overweight amid that country &apos;s mounting difficulty achieving convertibility , according to a report by BankBoston director of emerging market research Jose Garcia-Medrano . 
&quot; It will be extremely difficult for ( President Abdala ) Bucaram to secure ... the votes needed to pass the 12 legislative segments of the convertibility law and to begin its scheduled implementation on July 1 , &quot; Garcia-Medrano said . 
&quot; We now anticipate a much longer delay in the negotiations with Congress and the strong likelihood of a failure to secure the necessary legislative support for implementation , &quot; Garcia-Medrano said . 
a general strike is expected to begin in Ecuador on Wednesday to protest the corruption and recently decreed price increases , he said .
