Lonrho South Africa shares fell on Monday after British mining to hotels conglomerate Lonrho plc reported a slump in its first half profits , dealers said . 
by about 0805 GMT the stock was down 18 cents at 950 cents , with 29,400 shares exchanging hands on the counter . 
the stock had recovered slightly off a morning opening low of 940 cents . 
&quot; I think the share is coming off because of the poor results they announced today , &quot; one dealer said . 
Lonrho plc , which is in preliminary merger talks with local mining house JCI Ltd , on Monday announced a slide in its pre-tax profit to 38 million pounds ( $ 62.9 million ) from 61 million in the six months ended March 31 . 
the group said its profits , which was in line with analysts &apos; expectations , had been hit by the pound &apos;s strength and lower contributions from Ghana &apos;s Ashanti Goldfields Co Ltd . 
dealers added that worry about precious metals prices had also toned down sentiment on most of the local mining stocks , including Lonrho , on Monday . 
&quot; Obviously the share comes under a little bit of pressure on the back of poor results and the precious metals are not looking particularly good at the moment . 
gold is down and platinum is down as well , so I think there might be some kind of effect from there as well on Lonrho , &quot; another dealer said . 
Lonrho &apos;s chief executive Nick Morrell told Reuters in London on Monday that merger talks with JCI Ltd were continuing but added that they were still at an early stage . 
the group also dismissed a weekend press report in London that its 41 percent holding in Ashanti was being sized up by local mining house Gencor Ltd . 
&quot; Ashanti is a very important asset and we have no plans at this stage to divest it , &quot; Morrell addded .
