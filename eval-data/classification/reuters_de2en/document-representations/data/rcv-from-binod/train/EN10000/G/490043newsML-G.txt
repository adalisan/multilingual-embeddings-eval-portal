the Jammu and Kashmir public transport bus was at a bridge in Pathankot heading for Jammu when the device went off at , he said . 
one person was killed on the spot and another died later in hospital and four of the injured were in a serious condition , he added .

&quot; We have sent a team of scientists and forensic experts to establish the make and potency of the bomb , &quot; Chahal added . 
Pathankot is located near Punjab &apos;s border with Jammu and Kashmir state and also near the international border with Pakistan . 
police and hospital officials say more than 20,000 people have died in insurgency-related violence since a separatist rebellion erupted in Jammu and Kashmir , mostly Hindu India &apos;s only Moslem-majority state , in 1990 . 
on Saturday , five separatist guerrillas were killed in two gun battles with Indian security forces in Kashmir .
