German leaders on Wednesday invoked the spirit of the late chancellor Ludwig Erhard , whose idea of a social market economy propelled the postwar &quot; economic miracle , &quot; to help Germany face its current challenges . 
to mark Erhard &apos;s 100th birthday , Chancellor Helmut Kohl , Finance Minister Theo Waigel , Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer and others said his vision , forged in a simpler time , was still valid in an era of globalisation . 
saddled with record unemployment and dizzied by the pace of technological progress and market integration , Germany must revive the creativity , flexibility , and willingness to innovate and work hard that Erhard also advocated , Waigel said . 
&quot; We cannot wait for a &apos; miracle &apos; , we have to act , &quot; Waigel said . 
the cigar-chomping Erhard , who died in 1977 , was Bonn &apos;s first economics minister from 1949 to 1963 and then its second chancellor from 1963 to 1966 . 
his 100th birthday will fall on February 4 but the ceremony was scheduled for Wednesday . 
Erhard &apos;s social market economy , with its stress on consensus between management and labour and its strong safety net to soften the market &apos;s blows , helped underpin West Germany &apos;s democratic rebirth from the ashes of the Third Reich . 
Waigel said the &quot; stability-oriented social market economy &quot; is a major German export that has influenced policy makers throughout the world . 
Germany also stands on the brink of giving up its beloved deutschemark -- another Erhard brainchild -- when European monetary union begins in 1999 . 
Tietmeyer cited Erhard in an indirect criticism of French calls for a political counterweight to the European Central Bank ( ECB ) to ensure the bank maintains a suitable exchange rate for the euro . 
Tietmeyer recalled Bonn had planned a similar counterweight for the Bundesbank but Erhard opposed it and won the day . 
the lesson was that ECB independence would be an absolute prerequisite for a stable currency . 
&quot; No one should doubt this , whatever his arguments or additional ideas , &quot; he said . 
any group that formally accepted the ECB &apos;s independence but actually tried to sway it would undermine its credibility and could lead to conflict within the monetary union , he said . 
Kohl , who sought to portray his economic policies as a continuation of Erhard &apos;s successful path , credited his mentor with laying the basis for the affluence Germany still enjoys . 
&quot; Without him , the economic prosperity and social peace that has effectively lasted down to this day would not have been conceivable , &quot; Kohl said in opening remarks to an audience of 2,000 including Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker . 
&quot; We all see his work is relevant for us today . 
we Germans have a lot to thank him for , &quot; Kohl said . 
but this once-lean welfare state , which made West Germany relatively immune to the aggressive free market policies pursued in Britain and the United States in the 1980s , has grown fat over the years . 
although he preaches the virtures of Erhard &apos;s policies , Kohl has had less success in unshackling the economy and weaning Germans off the comforts of the welfare state . 
he has stood aside in recent weeks to have his cabinet ministers fight for controversial tax reforms and cuts in the pension system , both meant in part to keep Bonn &apos;s deficit down in preparation for Europe &apos;s single currency . 
the emphasis Kohl put on making the economy more competitive prompted howls from the opposition Social Democrats ( SPD ) , who said the centre-right government was forgetting the social part of Erhard &apos;s message . 
&quot; This coalition has betrayed its social conscience , &quot; SPD party manager Franz Muentefering said . 
&quot; It is not fighting unemployment . 
it has proposed an unfair tax system .
