U.S. municipal bonds gained around one-eighth to one-quarter of a point , aided by a report that showed inflation was surprisingly mild though concerns that dealers &apos; inventories were rising checked the gains . 
the December municipal bond futures traded on the Chicago Board of Trade outperformed the cash market , rising 16 ticks to 114-20 / 32 . 
they were slightly outpaced by U.S. Treasury bond futures , which climbed 20 ticks to 110-21 / 32 . 
as a result , the mob spread between the two futures continued to narrow , slipping to 127 ticks . 
scheduled competitive and negotiated municipal bond sales are expected to total $ 2.446 billion in 105 offerings for the week of Oct 14 , according to Reuters Municipal Bond Information Group . 
market players were stepping back from the market ahead of the release of the Consumer Price Index on Tuesday . 
these data also are expected to show that inflation is not heating up , as economists projected a 0.1 percent increase . 
the possibility that the recent strength displayed by the stock market will continue to hold the attention of individual investors left municipal bond traders concerned that dealers were starting to accumulate too much inventory . 
&quot; I think more bonds are in dealers &apos; hands than was once suspected , &quot; a trader said . 
he cited continued selling by institutional customers , who are trying to improve the structure of their portfolios , and the scarcity of cash held by municipal bond funds . 
further , the calender for new issues contains some sizable offerings in the next two weeks . 
competitive sales total $ 1.097 billion in 63 offerings . 
the largest issue is a $ 200 million Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority obligation issue on Oct 17 . 
negotiated sales total $ 1.349 billion in 42 offerings . 
the largest issue is a $ 375 million New York City Municipal Finance Water Authority bond offering through PaineWebber Inc . 
the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority had been considering delaying the bond sale by one week , but instead decided to go ahead with it on October 16 . 
the negotiated calender also includes $ 175 million of Ohio taxable revenue bonds . 
among competitive offerings , the market was looking ahead to two sales by bond sales by San Francisco International Airport . 
the $ 165 million offering is subject to the alternative minimum tax , and the $ 110 million sale is not . 
actively quoted issues on Friday included Denver Colorado City and County Airport revenues of November 2025 , which pay a 5-1 / 2 percent coupon . 
they were offered at 5.75 percent net , down six basis points from levels seen on Thursday . 
and North Central Texas Health Facilities Development Corp revenues of June 2021 , which carry a 5-1 / 2 percent coupon , were offered at 5.79 percent net , down three basis points .
