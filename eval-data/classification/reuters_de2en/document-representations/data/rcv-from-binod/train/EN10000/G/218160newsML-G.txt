the family of British civil servant Peter Chetnik feared the worst when he called repeatedly from Thailand to say he had been kidnapped and persuaded them to send thousands of pounds in ransom money . 
but when local police were sent in to investigate , they found the 30-year-old living with his girlfriend in a Thai beach resort rather than being imprisoned by kidnappers . 
Chetnik confessed he made up the ransom threat to get more spending money from his parents because he feared they would not send him the cash if he simply asked for it . 
&quot; It was all found to be a total fabrication . 
there has never been any suggestion that he was held against his will , &quot; a British Foreign Office spokesman said on Tuesday . 
&quot; The gentleman is in financial difficulties and we are trying to help him out on that score . 
Chetnik &apos;s mother Maria said she had sent thousands of pounds after her son had called up from Thailand , where he was taking a year off to write a book . 
&quot; He first called five or six months ago , saying he was being held hostage and begging me to get him released , &quot; she told the Daily Telegraph newspaper . 
&quot; Then he telephoned again , always reversing the charges , and we kept sending money -- a lot of money . 
I would hear Thai voices and then he would be cut off , &quot; she said . 
but Chetnik &apos;s luck ran out when his mother contacted local police who then alerted the Foreign Office . 
Thai police found him in the southern resort of Cha-am and he now has to face the wrath of his mother .
