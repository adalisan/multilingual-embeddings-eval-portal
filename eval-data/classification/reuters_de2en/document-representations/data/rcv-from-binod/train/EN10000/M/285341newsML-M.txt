the spokeswoman told Reuters the 1996 figures were revised from the $ 4.5 trillion reported earlier this week . 
the rise from 1995 came despite a drop in the number of contracts traded , which fell nine percent to 136 million last year , she said , noting that the size of the contracts rose significantly . 
as a result , BM &amp; F became the world &apos;s fourth largest futures exchange in terms of contracts traded , down from number three in 1995 , she added . 
Bolsa officials predict an average 84 million contracts will trade hands this year but declined to project financial volume in 1997 . 
departing BM &amp; F President Manoel Pires Costa e Silva and the man who will replace him , Manoel Cintra , will hold a news conference Tuesday to discuss 1996 and projections for this year . 
the spokeswoman said interest rate contracts accounted for 62 percent of financial volume and 39 percent of the total number of contracts traded in 1996 . 
meanwhile , exchange rate contracts accounted for 20 percent of financial volume , swaps seven percent , stock index contracts six percent , options three percent and agriculture , gold and others one percent , she added .
