NASA officials on Monday disputed a top Russian space official &apos;s statement that the international space station would be delayed and said no decision had been made . 
Russian space agency head Yuri Koptev told reporters in Moscow on Monday the scheduled November launch of the first space station component was being delayed by seven months . 
&quot; NASA respects the opinion of Mr Koptev but no final decisions have yet been made at all , &quot; NASA spokesman Rob Navias said . 
the first component , a U.S.-financed , Russian-built orbital tug , is on schedule , but a Russian-funded service module , due for launch in April and needed to maintain the station &apos;s orbit , is running up to eight months late . 
the Russian government has promised to start funding construction of the module by the end of February so it could be ready for a November 1998 launch . 
sources close to $ 40 billion project have said a delay of at least six months now seems inevitable but the details still had to be worked out . 
&quot; We have said several times in recent weeks that we are aggressively reviewing our options in terms of the flight hardware and assembly schedule , &quot; agency spokesman Ed Campion said . 
U.S. and Russian officials were meeting in Houston this week to discuss ways of maintaining the station &apos;s orbit before the service module can be launched . 
they were considering purchasing a second space tug from Russia that could be controlled from the United States and refueled by the shuttle . 
they were also considering modifying the existing space tug to perform the same function . 
a converted U.S. military upper stage could also be used but it could not be refueled . 
NASA chief Daniel Goldin and Koptev were due to hold a video conference in the next two weeks to discuss the matter .
