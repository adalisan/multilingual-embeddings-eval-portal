air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston on Monday withdrew from consideration to become chairman of the U.S. military Joint Chiefs of Staff in an uproar over an adulterous affair he had 13 years ago . 
but Defence Secretary Willian Cohen said he had asked Ralston , 53 , to remain as vice chairman of the powerful joint chiefs and that Ralston had agreed . 
meanwhile , he said , he was reviewing other candidates for the nation &apos;s top military job . 
&quot; This is solely my decision and I make it with a sense of regret , &quot; Ralston said in a statement after he met privately with Cohen over whether he should continue as a candidate to succeed Army Gen. John Shalikashvili , who retires Sept . 30 . 
&quot; My regret is that the public discussion surrounding my potential nomination blurred the facts in a number of recent cases and gave the appearance of a double-standard regarding military justice , &quot; said Ralston , whose two-year term as vice chairman would end in February of 1998 . 
Ralston admitted last week that he had an adulterous relationship while separated from his first wife more than a decade ago . 
despite that , Cohen said at the time that Ralston was still high on his list of candidates for JCS chairman . 
but that came after the Air Force only last month forced its first woman bomber pilot , Lt. Kelly Flinn , to resign to avoid a court martial on adultery and other charges , sparking accusations from Congress of uneven application of military justice . 
lawmakers warned after the controversy broke that the Senate might reject Ralston if he were to be nominated by President Bill Clinton for the joint chiefs &apos; leadership . 
a senior defence official , who asked not to be identified , said that Cohen did not press Ralston to withdraw but the general had made the personal decision after going to Capitol Hill and deciding that to continue would be &quot; draining , difficult and distracting , &quot; although he thought he could win confirmation . 
Cohen said in a statement on Monday that Ralston had asked him to withdraw his name from consideration and he had agreed . 
&quot; General Ralston believes that a prolonged fight for Senate confirmation would be harmful to his family and would be a distraction from other serious national security matters , &quot; the secretary said , adding that he felt Ralston had &quot; been fully qualified to serve as chairman . 
&quot; Because of General Ralston &apos;s abilities , I have asked him to continue in his current post as vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , and he has agreed , &quot; Cohen said . 
Shalikashvili told reporters on Monday he would not consider delaying his own retirement to remain in the post for a third two-year term . 
Shalikashvili , who had recommended Ralston to succeed him , called his friend &apos;s decision &quot; a very sad day for me . 
defence officials said Cohen was not expected to make a final recommendation to Clinton for a new chairman until he returned from a week-long visit to Europe and the Gulf beginning on Thursday . 
one official , who asked not to be identified , said a number of senior officers were under consideration including the chiefs of the individual U.S. military services and heads of commands around the world . 
Cohen and the White House had set off a heated debate , saying when the controversy broke last week that Ralston remained high on Cohen &apos;s list of candidates to succeed Shalikashvili . 
Cohen said then that Ralston &apos;s previous affair should not eliminate him from consideration because it had not threatened &quot; the good order and discipline &quot; of the military . 
the Pentagon said the Ralston case was different from that of 26-year-old Air Force Lt. Flinn , who was forced to resign without an honourable discharge to avoid a court-martial on charges of adultery , fraternisation , lying and failure to obey orders . 
but many members of Congress , especially women , said they could see no major difference .
