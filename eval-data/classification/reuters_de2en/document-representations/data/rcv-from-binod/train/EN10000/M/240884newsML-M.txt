Germans may still end up decking their halls with boughs of money , despite the steep dive in the country &apos;s stock market on Friday . 
even after the blue-chip DAX index fell more than four percent -- its sharpest one-day slide in five years -- German shares have enough strength to deliver a Merry Christmas and possibly a Happy New Year , analysts said . 
&quot; The bourse still has upward momentum because profits are still climbing in Germany and the German market as a whole could become even more attractive if other markets fall , &quot; said Gerhard Grebe , chief economist at Bank Julius Baer Frankfurt . 
&quot; This is a healthy correction . 
people are not running for the exits , &quot; he told Reuters Financial Television . 
the 30-share DAX index closed bourse trade at 2,791.96 on Friday , over four percent down on the day but well above its intra-day low of 2,760.76 . 
the index recovered to around 2,820 points in afternoon computer-based trade in response to weaker than expected U.S. jobs data , which reduced market fears about the U.S. economy . 
the slide was a rude awakening for the market , which only a day earlier had closed above 2,900 points for the first time , after forging more than 100 points higher in the week . 
even after today &apos;s fall , the DAX is still about 25 percent up on the year . 
the dip below 2,800 points , the first since November 22 , marked the index &apos;s biggest fall since the shock from Russia &apos;s August 1991 coup against Mikhail Gorbachev . 
&quot; We had risen too fast and overheated , and some profit-taking and consolidation can only be healthy for the market , &quot; Grebe said . 
the fall in German stocks followed comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan that central banks had to beware of &quot; irrational euphoria &quot; in recent stock and bond gains . 
investors sold off dollars in response , and Asian markets fell sharply , with the key Nikkei 225 index dropping more than three percent . 
Reimut Jochimsen , president of the state central bank in North Rhine-Westphalia , further unsettled markets when he said the German economy had no basis for self-sustaining growth . 
he also saw no need to prop up the economy with monetary policy . 
hardest hit on the DAX were export-heavy shares such as the chemical groups . 
industrial group Mannesmann AG , which rose on Thursday on rumours of a telecommunications alliance , fell back five percent to 643 marks . 
meanwhile , German government bonds extended a tumble begun late on Thursday on a sell-off of U.S. debt , as Greenspan &apos;s comments compounded concerns . 
but the market was supported by dealers &apos; view that Germany , a traditional safe-haven for capital , could benefit from outflows from other European bonds . 
as losses hit markets all across Europe , and investors braced for more bad news on Wall Street , analysts dismissed fears German markets would continue to fall longer-term . 
&quot; optimism is giving way to realism , &quot; Thomas Tilse , equity analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt , told Reuters Financial Television . 
&quot; We should expect the market to grow 3.5 percent next year rather than the more than 20 percent we have seen this year . 
it will be a difficult year , but not a time for crashes , &quot; he said .
