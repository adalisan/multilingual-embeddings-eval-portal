the pound swiftly reclaimed lost ground against the mark on Tuesday and retested waters above 2.79 marks as dealers used its correction on Monday as an opportunity to buy on dips . 
sterling &apos;s yield attractions and a big buy order of pounds for yen helped sterling / mark along the way , pushing it up over one pfennig in European morning trade to a high of 2.7955 after it hit a low of 2.7730 on Monday . 
&quot; The yield argument is still convincing people to buy the pound at lower levels , &quot; said Pat Magill , head of the corporate desk at Daiwa Europe . 
another factor boosting the pound on Tuesday was the firmer tone of dollar / mark , said Magill . 
the dollar firmed slightly against the mark after Germany &apos;s six leading economic institutes said they expected the U.S. currency to average 1.80 marks in 1998 . 
the institutes foresaw the Bundesbank holding interest rates steady in 1997 unless there was a sharp dollar rise , and forecast a small rise in official interest rates in early 1998 . 
sterling ran out of steam , though , after a comment by Bundesbank council member Franz-Christoph Zeitler capped dollar / mark , dealers said . 
Zeitler said there now exists no need for major currencies to correct against the mark . 
a positive chart picture also supports the pound , technical analysts said . 
the UK unit hit a 4-1 / 2 year high at 2.8230 marks last Tuesday . 
&quot; I &apos;m still bullish in the longer term on sterling / mark , &quot; said Nick Shamin , currency analyst at Technical Data , adding that the correction provided a good buying opportunity at lower levels . 
against the firmer dollar , however , sterling made little progress . 
traders see it trapped in a range between $ 1.6220 and $ 1.6420 in the medium term . 
sterling / dollar was at $ 1.6347 / 57 , little changed from the European close on Monday . 
sterling / mark was at 2.7923 / 33 against 2.7819 / 29 , while against the yen the pound stood at 206.02 / 32 , up from around 205 at the previous European close but still below its multi-year peak at 206.98 , set on Monday . 
the next domestic focus will be March retail sales data and a 2.0 billion stg auction of 7.0 percent gilts stock due 2002 on Wednesday . 
retail sales are forecast to rise 0.3 percent for a year-on-year rate of 4.3 percent , down from 4.4 percent in February .
