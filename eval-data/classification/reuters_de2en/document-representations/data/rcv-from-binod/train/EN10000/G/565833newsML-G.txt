NATO must do much more to reach a compromise with Russia on a charter laying out relations , but failure to agree this month will not be the end of negotiations , President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s spokesman said on Wednesday . 
&quot; Much more effort is needed from NATO as a bloc and from its members to reach mutually acceptable formulae which would allow us to sign the document , &quot; Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing . 
&quot; Boris Nikolayevich ( Yeltsin ) may go to Paris and take part in the signing if the final version of the text suits both NATO and Russia . 
if it does , then he will go and sign . 
if not , we are not limited by any timeframes . 
we will keep on working . 
Russia fiercely opposes NATO &apos;s expansion plans and ministers have been holding round after round of talks with NATO officials to try to seal a deal on relations between the two sides . 
both sides hope the document can be ready for signing by May 27 . 
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov met NATO Secretary General Javier Solana in Luxembourg this week and the talks will continue next week in Moscow .
