Israeli jets launched a wave of air raids against suspected Hizbollah targets in south Lebanon on Friday after the Islamic guerrillas attacked three Israeli posts , Lebanese security sources said . 
they said the planes first fired eight rockets into Iqlim al-Toufah mountain ridge controlled by pro-Iranian Hizbollah fighters north of Israel &apos;s south Lebanon occupation zone . 
the jets later launched three air attacks on the Sojoud hills on the edge of the zone and two on the outskirts of the village of Louwaizeh in the Iqlim al-Toufah highlands . 
pro-Israeli militia sources in the south Lebanon zone said guerrillas attacked three Israeli posts -- Sojoud , Kassaret al-Ouroush and Beir Kallab -- facing Iqlim al-Toufah . 
they said two Israeli soldiers were lightly wounded at Sojoud post . 
shortly after the first raid , Hizbollah ( Party of God ) said in a statement that a group of guerrillas firing machineguns and anti-tank rockets attacked Sojoud and nearby Kassaret al-Ouroush in the morning . 
a second group attacked the Israeli position at Beir Kallab , causing a number of casualties , the Shi &apos;ite Moslem group added . 
Israeli artillery gunners also opened up with artillery fire at Iqlim al-Toufah and the Sojoud hills -- at times at a rate of eight shells per minute -- and helicopters strafed the Sojoud hills with machinegunfire , the security sources said . 
&quot; It seems the Israelis are chasing a group of guerrillas . 
the air raids , strafing and shelling are moving from one hill to another , &quot; one security source said . 
there was no immediate word on casualties in the air attacks , the first Israeli raids into Lebanon in 1997 . 
on Thursday , guerrillas set off a roadside bomb near a patrol of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) in the zone , wounding three militiamen . 
Hizbollah is fighting to oust some 1,000 Israeli troops and 3,000 SLA militia from the border occupation zone set up in south Lebanon in 1985 to ward off guerrilla raids on northern Israel .
