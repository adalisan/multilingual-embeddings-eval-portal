the U.S. Treasury yield curve could flatten next week if Asian investors return from their New Year &apos;s holiday to purchase long-term U.S. bonds , analysts said Friday . 
traders saw potential for heavy Treasury purchases by Japanese investors on Monday . 
buying is expected to focus on longer-term maturities , given current views of Fed policy . 
the spread between yields of two-year to 30-year treasuries stayed at around 79 basis points Friday , after slowly moving up from a 74 basis-point spread at Christmas . 
this week &apos;s sharp backup of nearly a quarter-point in interest rates and a recent rise in the dollar have made treasuries attractive once again . 
&quot; We saw buying as we steepened out , which has taken the steepness out &quot; of the yield curve , said Richard Schwarz , senior trader at Zions First National Bank . 
Schwarz noted most of the buying has been in the intermediate to longer sectors . 
&quot; But it will be interesting to see what happens when the Japanese come back ( from their New Year &apos;s vacation ) . 
we have backed up 25 basis points since they went away , &quot; he added . 
&quot; Monday will be a first litmus test to see if Asians look at ( the selloff ) as a good buying opportunity . 
Treasury yields rose sharply Tuesday and Thursday in response to much stronger-than-expected economic data on housing and manufacturing activity . 
economists immediately began talking about the possibility the Federal Reserve may have to raise rates to thwart a possible rise in inflation . 
however , the yield curve suggests otherwise . 
Patrick Dimick , Treasury market strategist at UBS Securities LLC , said it is unusal to see the curve steepen during a selloff . 
typically , he said , when economic data are strong , there is worry about inflation , which pushes long rates up . 
but since strong data also bring concerns about Fed tightening , short rates go up even more -- thus a flattening of the curve ensues . 
&quot; The conclusion you can reach from the first two trading sessions of the year is &apos; yes , the economic data are strong and the market is refecting the risks of faster growth and higher inflation , but there has not been a core response at the short end that the Fed will have to start tightening , &apos; &quot; Dimick said . 
&quot; The Fed has shown preference to ride out the storm when we get one weak or strong quarter and not tinker with rates , and the market is getting comfortable with that . 
therefore , players said , the recent steepening merely reflected speculative flows in intermediates and longer maturities . 
&quot; So , when we start getting strong data people will start selling 10-year and 30-year contracts rather than taking the bet on short term rates and what the Fed is going to be doing , &quot; Dimick said . 
&quot; As long as the trend continues , the short end is locked in and the curve steepens during selloffs and flattens during rallies . 
analysts said they expect the main focus of the market in the near term will be on intermediates , known as the &quot; belly of the curve . 
one market strategist at a primary dealership noted intermediates have dominated trading in recent sessions . 
&quot; Fives and tens led the market on the way up and they are leading on the way down , &quot; she said . 
as the two-year to 30-year spread steepened this week , the 10-year to 30-year spread narrowed . 
Thursday , the 10-year note to 30-year bond spread flattened to as little as 21 basis points , moving back out to 23 to 24 basis points Friday . 
on the other hand , the two-year to five-year spread had narrowed Friday to around 33 basis points after steepening on Thursday to as much as 36 basis points . 
&quot; Hedge funds , central banks and real money investors were selling fives and 10s ( Thursday ) , &quot; the market strategist said . 
&quot; So , we are seeing more belly of the curve shifting . 
some speculated that the illiquid environment due to the holiday season made the damage look worse than it is , and a truer test will come next week when the market returns to full speed . 
the overall yield curve steepened in December in anticipation of strong reinvestment demand from maturing securities . 
the two-year to 30-year had widened to as much as 83 basis points in the middle of the month . 
but , traders said , when that reinvestment demand was not that strong , dealers sold the front end , causing the curve to flatten again before steepening this week . 
&quot; Now , &quot; Schwarz said . 
&quot; The yield curve is getting back into normal shape .
