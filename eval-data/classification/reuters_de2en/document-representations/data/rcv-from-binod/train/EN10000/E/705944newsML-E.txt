Chattanooga , Tenn . , will launch a revitalization of its Southside district with construction of a trade center and a conference center next year , Mayor Jon Kinsey said Thursday . 
the city plans to issue bonds for the projects in early 1998 , Kinsey said . 
cost of the two projects is estimated at $ 50 million . 
Kinsey said the city and private interests are expected to pump hundreds of millions of dollars into the area over 10 to 15 years . 
&quot; The Southside is going to be a model area for our city where people can work and live and worship . 
there &apos;s a lot of churches , a school is planned for the area . 
unlike past redevelopment where they came in and bulldozed everything , we &apos;re going to take what is there and work with it , &quot; Kinsey said . 
the city passed a half-cent sales tax increase last year to provide funds for initial construction . 
the tax is expected to raise about $ 13 million a year , with half allocated for schools and half earmarked for economic development . 
the city council approved plans for the project 5-1 on Tuesday .
