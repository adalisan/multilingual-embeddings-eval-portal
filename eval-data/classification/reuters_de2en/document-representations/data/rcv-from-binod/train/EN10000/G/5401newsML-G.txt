the U.S. Tennis Association broke with its own longstanding tradition and took a page out of the Wimbledon handbook on Wednesday by deviating from the ATP Tour rankings in formulating men &apos;s seedings for the U.S. Open Tennis Championships . 
unlike Wimbledon officials , the usually conservative association has for many years seeded players at the Open strictly according to world rankings . 
USTA President and tournament Chairman Les Snyder decided to do things a little differently this year , withholding the list of men &apos;s seeds until just prior to Wednesday &apos;s draw ceremony with the promise of a few surprises . 
most notable was the bumping of red-hot Michael Chang , currenly ranked a career-high third in the world , to the second seed , right behind world number one Pete Sampras . 
that dropped second-ranked Thomas muster of Austria , who has achieved nearly all of his success on clay , to the third spot for the tournament which begins on Monday . 
Snyder said tournament officials wanted the seedings to be a more accurate predictor of the event rather than a reflection of the rankings computer . 
he said a player &apos;s showing in the other Grand slams , recent performance and record on hard courts were all taken into consideration in making the seeding decisions . 
he insisted the popularity of a player was not a factor . 
&quot; Just like any sport , players can get on a hot streak and I think that should be taken into account , &quot; Snyder said . 
Chang holds a 15-1 match record during the summer hardcourt season after winning titles in Washington and Los Angeles and reaching the final in Cincinnati . 
in other moves , eighth-ranked Andre Agassi , coming off victories in the Olympics and at Cincinnati , was seeded sixth , and seventh-ranked Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek was seeded fifth . 
despite a history of disappointing showings at Flushing meadow , sixth-ranked Croatian Goran Ivanisevic was seeded fourth , while fourth-ranked French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov was seeded only seventh . 
Sixteenth-ranked Spaniard Felix Mantilla , who would have been awarded the final seeding under the usual U.S. Open format , was left unseeded , allowing Frenchman Cedric Pioline to join the seeded ranks in the men &apos;s draw . 
asked how he hoped it would all pan out on the final Sunday , Snyder said : &quot; I &apos;d like to have what we had last year , women one and two , and men one and two . 
the following is the list of men &apos;s seeds for the U.S. Open with their world ranking in parenthesis . 
several of the players were moved up one place by the withdrawal of fifth-ranked Boris Becker , who pulled out with a wrist injury .
