Mexico &apos;s overnight Cetes rate closed up five basis points at 29.55 percent on Monday after a quiet , uneventful session , traders said . 
&quot; Very quiet indeed . 
overnight rates seem to have found their level and as long as no momentous news breaks , we shall move sideways , &quot; said a trader . 
the overnight rate wavered between a low of 29.25 percent and a high of 29.60 percent during the session . 
traders said that stability in the overnight rate was bolstered by a similarly stable peso . 
the 48-hour peso closed earlier 0.3 of a centavo firmer at 7.8920 / 7.8980 per dollar . 
traders said such stability would also lead to stability in primary interest rates at the central bank &apos;s auction after the session . 
a Reuters survey of money market traders showed they expected bellwether 28-day Cetes rates to fall by an average of two basis points from last week &apos;s auction to 29.87 percent . 
overnight rates on bank paper meanwhile closed down ten basis points at 30.90 percent . 
Banco de Mexico injected 6.206 billion pesos by auctioning five credits , which it assigned at between 31.06 and 32.04 percent . 
credit maturities for Tuesday were expected to total 8.482 billion pesos , but traders said the ensuing liquidity squeeze could be eased by government spending of approximately 2.5 billion pesos . 
traders said activity could pick up after inflation figures are published for the first half of November , possibly as early as Thursday .
