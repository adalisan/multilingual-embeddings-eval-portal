a top aide to Reform Party presidential candidate Ross Perot on Thursday called &quot; absolutely foolish &quot; a last-ditch plea from struggling Republican nominee Bob Dole to Perot to quit the race and endorse him . 
&quot; Ross Perot has no intention of withdrawing from this year &apos;s election , &quot; said Russell Verney , National Coordinator of Perot &apos;s White House campaign . 
he commented as U.S. political circles buzzed with astonishment at reports -- not officially confirmed by Dole &apos;s side but not denied either -- that the Republican had made a desperate pitch for help from the Texas billionaire just 12 days before his November 5 election showdown with President Bill Clinton . 
only a month ago Dole &apos;s campaign led a successful effort to keep the sharp-tongued Texan out of televised Dole-Clinton campaign debates . 
that infuriated Perot , who is running a weak third in the polls and badly needed exposure in the debates . 
&quot; This whole effort of first locking Ross Perot out of the debates , pretending that he doesn &apos;t exist in American politics ... and then in the 11th hour of the campaign , recognising that it is probably the last hope you have to try and win the presidency , for someone to come and ask him to drop out is absolutely foolish . 
Ross is here to stay , &quot; Verney said in a CNN interview . 
he commented shortly before Perot was expected to discuss the Dole overture during an appearance at the National Press Club in Washington . 
news reports broke on Wednesday night saying Dole campaign manager Scott Reed visited Perot in Dallas on Wednesday to get the industrialist to ask him to quit the campaign and urge his supporters to back Dole . 
dole has made campaign statements asserting that he was the real reform candidate and the natural rallying point for Perot backers . 
the former Kansas senator is running behind Clinton by double-digits in most opinion polls , but Perot too has failed to capture the support he received as an independent candidate four years ago when he got about 19 percent of the vote . 
polls show him with about five or six percent support now . 
a bipartisan presidential debate commission planning the debates recommended on September 17 that only the two major candidates be allowed to participate in the high-profile presidential debates , saying Perot did not appear to have a realistic chance of becoming president . 
the next day Perot laid the blame on Dole &apos;s camp , describing the move as &quot; a blatant display of power by the Republicans and the large donors who fund their campaigns . 
after negotiations by Dole and Clinton campaign managers , Perot and his running mate , economist Pat Choate , were excluded for the two presidential and one vice presidential debates conducted during October . 
it said 43 percent would vote for Clinton as a second choice and only 33 percent would go for Dole .
