German call money rates were steady at 3.00 / 3.03 percent in morning dealings on Monday as the market found support on signs of less market liquidity . 
traders looked for rates to remain relatively steady in the near-term since a top Bundesbank official indicated on Friday that the central bank did not want to change the repo rate . 
&quot; The central bank has decided to nail us to the 3.00 percent level for the foreseeable future , &quot; said one Frankfurt money market trader . 
Bank reserves rose slightly to 38.5 billion marks as of Friday from 38.4 billion marks on Thursday . 
the monthly average fell to 40.8 billion marks from 42.1 billion marks . 
traders said the market was pleased that there were no Lombard borrowings on Friday . 
the Bundesbank has moved the market away from the emergency lending window after rates last week dipped below 3.00 percent , the fixed repo rate level . 
the Frankfurt Interbank overnight average on Monday was at 3.05267 compared with 3.05067 percent on Friday .
