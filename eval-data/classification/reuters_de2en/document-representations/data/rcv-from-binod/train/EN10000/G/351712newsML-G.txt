Pakistani newspapers on Monday urged their readers to vote in the general election to keep democracy alive . 
&quot; A respectable turn-out is required both to ensure the credibility of the new government and to counter attempts by some to depict the election as meaningless or irrelevant , &quot; the Karachi-based Dawn newspaper said . 
President Farooq Leghari called Monday &apos;s election after he dismissed former prime minister Benazir Bhutto &apos;s government three months ago on disputed charges of corruption and misrule . 
Bhutto &apos;s Pakistan People &apos;s Party ( PPP ) and the Pakistan Muslim League ( PML ) led by Nawaz Sharif are the top contenders in the national and provincial elections . 
&quot; The moment the PPP government was dismissed , the tide shifted in favour of the PML and all signs are that it will coast to victory , &quot; the English-language Dawn said . 
&quot; Despite all these snags and hurdles , it must be stressed that the general elections and the exercise of the franchise by the people is the only means to keep democracy alive in this country , &quot; the English-language daily The News said . 
&quot; This could be the last chance for the survival of democracy , &quot; it said . 
the News said a low turn-out and a hung parliament would pave the way for increased interference by the president and the recently formed Council for Defence and National Security ( CDNS ) . 
&quot; People have noticed that the president has significantly increased his powers over the parliament and the events of the last few years ( have ) facilitated the de jure participation of the armed forces in the government in the shape of CDNS . 
&quot; Both these factors do not augur well for parliamentary democracy . 
the Nation , a Lahore-based daily , said Pakistanis were being asked for the fourth time in nine years to choose parties and leaders that have been tried and &quot; found wanting &quot; in office . 
&quot; From the fateful night of November 5 , when Leghari took the plunge and dismissed the Bhutto government , through the twists and turns and vicissitudes of the caretaker period , the country stands poised once again at a crossroads , &quot; it said . 
&quot; Which direction we will take ultimately rests on the decision of the people , &quot; it added . 
about 56.5 million Pakistanis aged 21 and over are eligible to vote in the elections for a new 217-seat National Assembly ( lower house ) and four provincial assemblies . 
polling stations opened across the country at 7 a.m. ( 0200 GMT ) and will stay open until 4 p.m. ( 1100 GMT ) , with results expected late in the evening .
