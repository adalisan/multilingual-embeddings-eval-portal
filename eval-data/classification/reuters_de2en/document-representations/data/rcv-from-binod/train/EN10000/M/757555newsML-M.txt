dollar / yen finally busted its long-standing resistance of 116.55 on Friday , reviving bullish signals for a trip beyond 117 , analysts said . 
the pair hit a high of 116.98 in its surge toward 117 , the 38-percent retracement level from the 1997 high of 127.46 on May 1 to the low of 110.62 set on June 11 . 
a sharp move higher is not unlikely , analysts said , after lagging the magnitude of the dollar &apos;s rally versus core European currencies for weeks . 
&quot; We &apos;ve crept through ( 116.55 ) today and that gives us a good bullish signal for the corrective May 28 high at 117 , &quot; said David Gilmore , a partner at Foreign Exchange analytics . 
a move above 117.00 would point to another key technical level , 119.00 , or the 50-percent retracement of the same 1997 high / low move , Gilmore said . 
he pointed out that since the drop from 127.46 was a precipitous one , there were few important resistance levels between here and the year &apos;s top . 
dollar / yen is ready to set a higher range after a long consolidation , according to one analyst at a Boston-based investment firm . 
&quot; Dollar / yen often sits and then makes a big move , and it should be on the upside , &quot; the analyst said . 
&quot; We would be long dollar / yen a bit more . 
elsewhere , technicians assigned little weight to dollar / mark &apos;s second retreat from 1.84 in as many days . 
dollar / mark &apos;s 72-month high of 1.8430 clearly is the goal , and it will remain so as long as Thursday &apos;s 1.8220 low holds . 
however , the Boston-based analyst cautioned that , should the dollar / mark consolidation persist for four or five straight days , players may start setting up shorts . 
Gilmore acknowledged that overbought conditions for the pair previously had no obvious impact on long positions . 
however , he suspected that this may begin to weigh on the speed of the rally . 
&quot; Conditions are getting pretty overbought and maybe we get another push up to 1.85 -- one perhaps that Piques the interest of central bankers , &quot; Gilmore said . 
&quot; That would be a great opportunity for one of the hedge funds to go in and sell -- they could make it look like an intervention and you could see a decent correction . 
a trendline beginning at the July 10 low of 1.7456 points to 1.80 as a level to look for in a correction , Gilmore said . 
dollar / Swiss , meanwhile , surged through November 1993 high of 1.5125 overnight in a push toward key resistance at the four-year high of 1.5402 . 
a more important top to target is the 1.5520 high of March 1993 , Gilmore said .
