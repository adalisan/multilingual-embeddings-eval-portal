IPE Brent futures appeared to have stalled in thin business on Friday despite a bullish technical outlook and traders said they were awaiting the open of U.S. markets for fresh direction . 
at 1135 GMT , June Brent crude stood at $ 18.40 , a cent down from Thursday &apos;s close , and May gas oil was $ 1.50 firmer at $ 166.25 . 
&quot; There is no news out , it is a Friday so there is a lack of interest , there are not so many locals out there , &quot; a broker said . 
&quot; But the technical picture is still definitely bullish . 
prices rose on Thursday amid more bullish news out of Iraq , and traders said while this was having little immediate impact on prices , it was adding background support . 
&quot; A fair amount of constructive news to combine with an improved technical outlook took prices higher yesterday and there is potential for further gains today , &quot; GNI research said in a daily report .
