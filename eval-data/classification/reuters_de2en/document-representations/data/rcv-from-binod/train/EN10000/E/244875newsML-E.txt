pressure groups told the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) on Monday it was a myth that trade liberalisation was good for everybody and urged it to help the poor by fixing existing rules before making new ones 
more than 30 Non-Governmental Organisations ( NGOs ) , most of them based in developing countries , said in a statement poverty was spreading despite trade liberalisation . 
&quot; Despite overall global growth and even faster expansion of trade , the problems of poverty , inequalities , unemployment and environmental degradation have worsened , &quot; they said as the 128 members of the WTO began their first ministerial meeting . 
&quot; It is a myth that trade liberalisation and the Uruguay Round accords have brought about greater prosperity for all , &quot; they said of trade liberalisation pacts sealed in 1993 . 
the NGOs said these agreements imposed the same rules on everybody , ignoring the wide gulf between rich and poor and putting many developing countries at a disadvantage . 
&quot; We predict that an inequitable system of trade rules will lead to social problems and upheaval , &quot; they said . 
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong , in the keynote address , said liberalisation meant more trade , more investment , more peace and more stability . 
WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero urged the meeting to agree to a deal for free global trade in goods like computers , saying information would be a basic necessity of the 21st Century and help bring the poor into the mainstream . 
but the NGOs said new agreements -- others being pushed at the week-long WTO meeting include core labour standards , investment and competition policies and openness in government procurement -- were not the real issue . 
&quot; The benefits of growth and trade have benefitted relatively few , &quot; they said . 
&quot; The ministers should decide that prompt and effective remedial measures be taken to redress the imbalances of the Uruguay Round agreements and of the trading rules and system as a whole , &quot; they said . 
&quot; Developed countries should not add new items onto the WTO agenda at the Ministerial Conference and in the next few years as this would certainly overload the trade system . 
the WTO conference should be concentrating on fixing problems liberalisation has caused for poorer countries , especially in farming and services now facing competition from imports , the NGOs said . 
poorer countries should be given more flexibility in time and policies to adjust to rapidly changing global trade and developed countries should move more quickly to reduce tariffs on goods produced in developing countries , they said . 
the NGOs also said that informal meetings of officials from rich nations were the driving force of the WTO and appealed for that to change . 
&quot; The structure and mode of operation of the WTO is imbalanced against weaker countries , many of which are not invited to informal meetings where important decisions are made , &quot; they charged . 
&quot; The WTO is also untransparent in its operations as most of its discussions are not made known to the public and often not even to national parliaments , &quot; they said . 
&quot; Discussions on important issues should be held in open meetings where all members can attend , rather than in small informal groups to which most members are not privy , &quot; they said .
