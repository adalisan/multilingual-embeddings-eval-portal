Singapore has revised downwards its 1996 forecast gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth to six percent and expects 1997 growth of between five to seven percent , with exports hit by a weak electronics sector . 
the latest revision is the third by the city-state this year , is down from a forecast of seven to eight percent growth made in August . 
Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also revealed that third quarter GDP growth was only 3.2 percent , down sharply from the second quarter &apos;s 7.5 percent . 
Lee told a trade award ceremony that Singapore &apos;s economy had been affected by the global slowdown in the electronics sector caused by a softening in demand , excess capacity and an oversupply of components . 
&quot; Given the weak third quarter , continued weakness in global electronics demand and the high production levels of fourth quarter 1995 , the Ministry of Trade &amp; Industry has revised its forecast of 1996 growth down , to about 6 percent , &quot; he said . 
Lee said the electronics industry was going through a cyclical slowdown . 
since electronics accounts for 44 percent of value added in the manufacturing sector , the Singapore economy has been significantly affected , he said . 
the latest government forecast for 1996 GDP growth is lower than that expected by many economists . 
Lee said the MTI &apos;s assessment is that the current economic slowdown in Singapore is cyclical . 
&quot; It reflects a cyclical slowdown in external demand , rather than structural problems in the Singapore economy . 
Lee noted that foreign investment commitments in Singapore remain strong . 
Lee said since the government &apos;s assessment is that the slowdown is mainly cyclical and has not been caused by a loss of competitiveness , it will not need to make any drastic policy adjustments to cope with the downturn . 
Lee said the outlook for 1997 would depend on how quickly the electronics industry picks up worldwide . 
&quot; This is difficult to predict , although the industry consensus is that it will happen by the second half of 1997 . 
&quot; Assuming this materialises , MTI expects the economy to grow in 1997 by five to seven percent , slightly lower than our medium term growth potential of six to eight percent , &quot; he said .
