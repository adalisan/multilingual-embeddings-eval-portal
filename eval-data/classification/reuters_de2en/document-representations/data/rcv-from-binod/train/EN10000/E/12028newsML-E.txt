Denmark on Friday joined a wave of European countries in cutting interest , dropping its 14-day Certificate of Deposit ( CD ) rate to 3.50 percent from 3.70 percent . 
Denmark &apos;s central bank said it decided on the cut as a result of similar moves by Germany , France , Austria , Belgium and the Netherlands on Thursday . 
Finland and Greece followed suit on Friday . 
&quot; We have reduced the rate in the wake of cuts by key European nations . 
&quot; a central bank spokeswoman said . 
it was the ninth 14-day rate cut this year , the last of which was on June 6 . 
the securities repurchase , or repo , rate is expected to fall to match the CD rate at the next repo offer next Thursday . 
the deposit and discount rate , cut three times so far this year , was left unchanged at 3.25 PCT . 
the cut had little effect on the bond market , which had already anticipated the move . 
two hours after the midmorning announcement the 10-year bond was one point above its opening 105.14 . 
the yield gap with the German benchmark rate narrowed to 92 basis points from Thursday &apos;s 94 basis points . 
the Danish crown strengthened slightly to 3.8632 to the mark from its opening rate of 3.8635 . 
finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft said the cuts , particularly Germany &apos;s , were a sign of renewed growth in European economies -- vital for export-dependent Denmark . 
&quot; This can only strengthen the impression that things are going the right way . 
it is vital for Denmark that the nascent upturn in Europe , and specially in Germany , is growing stronger , &quot; he told Reuters . 
&quot; It is of key importance for Denmark that the German trend improves . 
&quot; It is very positive that the difference has been reduced . 
the distance was very great when the repo and CD rates were 3.70 percent , &quot; Den Danske Bank director Mads Jacobsen told Reuters . 
he said that the Danish central bank &apos;s decision to cut by 0.20 point , compared with Thursdsay &apos;s German cut of 0.30 point , did not neccessarily mean a further 0.10 point Danish cut . 
&quot; There is room to cut a further 10 basis points but that is not something I would immediately expect , &quot; Jacobsen said . 
&quot; I would imagine that now the gap between the discount and the repo has narrowed there is no longer a great need for isolated adjustment of Danish rates , &quot; he added .
