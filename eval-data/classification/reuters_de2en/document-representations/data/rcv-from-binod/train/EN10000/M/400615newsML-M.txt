South African long bonds gained nearly 20 basis points on Tuesday on the back of what dealers described as genuine buying interest in a bullish market while the rand held onto stronger levels against the dollar . 
at 1405 GMT the key R150 was pegged at 14.485 percent , from an intraday low of 14.455 at 1325 GMT , and 14.655 percent on Monday following offshore and local jobber buying . 
bond traders said the market was benefiting from the rand &apos;s strength and should maintain its bullish trend trend until the March 12 budget . 
&quot; It &apos;s been quite strong today with both local and foreign participation . 
the market has been through a consolidation phase and is quite keen to be bullish , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; The overriding factors are the budget and the strength in the rand ... I tend to think that there &apos;s genuine investment coming in , not so much speculators , &quot; he said . 
the bond market , which was lethargic on Monday in part because of jitters ahead of Thursday &apos;s host of economic indicators , started well on Tuesday with the R150 quoted at 14.530 at 0700 GMT . 
&quot; It &apos;s just a scramble for stock , everything &apos;s looking good , &quot; a trader said shortly after the official opening . 
overall sentiment remained strong in the afternoon as offshore demand prevailed . 
&quot; A lot of people are worried that we are over-extended but the underlying trend is quite bullish , &quot; one trader said . 
explaining the trend , another said : &quot; They are probably yield hungry at this stage and South Africa is looking pretty attractive . 
on the currency market , the rand excited in the morning session as exporters and offshore investors continued to offload dollars into the market , bringing the local currency &apos;s gains to almost eight cents since Monday &apos;s opening . 
by noon it had steadied at 4.4165 on slower dollar sales and dealers said the market was taking a breather after a heady rush at the opening . 
at 1405 GMT the currency was at 4.4170 / 00 on the dollar , after touching its strongest level of 4.4110 / 4140 earlier in the day and compared to Monday &apos;s 4.4365 / 4395 close . 
most dealers said the afternoon session had been marked by good two-way trade which resulted in the rand moving sideways and predicted a short-term 4.41 to 4.43 trading range . 
&quot; The market was a little long in the afternoon but importer and offshore dollar demand reappeared , &quot; one said . 
against the crosses the rand was last quoted at 7.2233 / 2326 against sterling from 7.2333 / 2426 on Monday and at 0.3789 / 3793 marks from 7.2442 / 2567 previously . 
on the money market , rates held steady between 16.50 and 16.70 percent , while the 90-day BA rate was also unmoved at between 15.90 and 16.10 percent . 
the Reserve Bank quoted the daily shortage at 10.178 billion rand on Monday , down from 10.286 billion rand on Saturday . 
bond Exchange statistics showed foreigners sold a net 52.03 million rand worth of South African bonds on Monday after selling 56.58 million on Friday . 
nominal cumulative volumes were pegged at 3.58 billion rand on Monday from 3.2 billion rand on Friday .
