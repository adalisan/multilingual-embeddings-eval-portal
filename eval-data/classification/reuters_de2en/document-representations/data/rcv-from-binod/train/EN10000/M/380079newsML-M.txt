Tokyo naphtha prices edged higher on Friday due to firmer crudes , traders said . 
activity remained quiet in the wet market as petrochemical end-users kept a low profile prior to term talks with Kuwait Petroleum Corp ( KPC ) , they said . 
&quot; end-users don &quot; t want to give KPC an impression that the market is bullish ahead of the talks , &quot; one trader said . 
Naphtha &quot; s near-term spreads narrowed slightly as buyers held back amid steep backwardation , traders said . 
the one-month spread from first-half April was indicated at about plus $ 8.00 / 10.00 , compared with Thursday &quot; s $ 9.00 / 10.00 . 
Open-spec naphtha for second-half April was quoted at $ 232.00 / 234.00 per tonne . 
on Thursday , it was sold once to a South Korean firm at $ 233.00 , and again to a European trader at $ 232.00 , traders said . 
First-half April was assessed at $ 237.00 / 240.00 , up from late Thursday &quot; s $ 236.50 / 238.50 . 
KPC will hold term talks with about a dozen trading houses , oil firms and petrochemical end-users from Japan and South Korea from next Monday in Singapore for one-year supply contracts starting in March , traders said .
