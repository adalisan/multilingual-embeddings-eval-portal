fuel oil continued firm on Tuesday although some grades were talked higher than was warranted , traders said . 
&quot; There &apos;s no denying it &apos;s tight , but some of the numbers are not real , &quot; said one trader . 
a refiner looking to cover a high sulphur cracked short into the U.K. pulled out of the market after receiving up to four offers around $ 125-126 CIF . 
some dealers said levels were realistically around the low $ 120s . 
high sulphur barges gained up to $ 3-4 a tonne with early trades in the morning around $ 122 and $ 123 fob Ara . 
traders said there was improved demand which , coupled with firm crude , underpinned the higher price . 
but activity was slower in the afternoon . 
support continues from talk of Romanian interest for 500,000 tonnes of high sulphur fuel for the winter and an outstanding Tunisian requirement of 20,000-25,000 tonnes . 
low sulphur barges were in short supply when set against good enquiries and buyers were faced with buying at cargo prices of around $ 126-127 . 
there was unconfirmed talk that a Med buyer had secured a cargo into Milazzo at $ 135 CIF .
