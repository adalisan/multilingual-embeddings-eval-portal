defender Anton Rogan was recalled to international duty for Northern Ireland for the first time in four-and-a-half years on Wednesday , to replace Keith Rowland in the squad for Saturday &apos;s World Cup qualifier against Germany . 
the 30-year-old Rogan , who plays for London side Millwall , won the last of his 17 caps when he came on as a substitute against Lithuania in April 1992 . 
West Ham fullback Rowland dropped out of the 18-man squad travelling to Nuremberg for the group nine match because of a septic throat .
