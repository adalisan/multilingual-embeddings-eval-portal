Caracas stocks traded up in light trade as share prices gently bounced back after a string of falls left them undervalued relative to future earnings , traders said . 
&quot; Prices had arrived at very low levels , &quot; said Financorp broker Miguel Ortiz . 
Venezuelan equities are the worst performing in the region so far this year , down some eight percent after soaring over 100 percent last year . 
the market &apos;s 19-share index rose 0.38 percent to end at 6,201.31 points as nine million shares traded worth 1.6 billion bolivars ( $ 3.4 million ) . 
&quot; Volume is still low , basically because foreign investors are waiting out the market , &quot; added Ortiz . 
analysts say foreign investors are waiting concrete signs of reform spirit before committing fresh funds , such as passage of a complex package of social security reforms -- currently in Congress -- and privatization of aluminum and steel companies . 
Merinvest &apos;s composite index , which includes telephone company CANTV , closed up 0.64 percent at 95.71 percent . 
among traded stocks , 15 rose , 15 fell and nine closed flat .
