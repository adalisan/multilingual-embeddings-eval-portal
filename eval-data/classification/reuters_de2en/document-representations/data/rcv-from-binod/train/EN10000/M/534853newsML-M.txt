volatilities in nearby LIFFE coffee options rose across the board this week with the skew now favouring September , traders said on Thursday . 
but July volatility remained strong ahead of Brazil &apos;s frost season which starts in June . 
the last crop-damaging frosts in June and July 1994 triggered a sharp rally in world coffee prices . 
traders said July &apos;s at-the-money implied volatility at 39.5 percent , up from last week &apos;s 37 percent . 
September volatility was 43-44 percent and November stood at 40 percent . 
the implied volatilities were slightly inverted last week , favouring July . 
but that inversion was small because locals had been discounting chances of a frost . 
however the July volatility was expected to increase as the frost scare intensified , traders said . 
&quot; There was a small report out yesterday about cold weather in Brazil and the market is creeping up and up everyday , &quot; one said . 
&quot; But the movement so far has been marginal . 
but as we get nearer and nearer expiry and near the frost season , the vols will edge up slightly , &quot; he said . 
July options expiry on June 19 . 
&quot; But there &apos;s nothing in the market that suggests the vols will spike up . 
it will be fairly stable in the next couple of weeks . 
July $ 2,000 calls was traded 250 times on Wednesday , which traders said marked a very bullish strategy . 
&quot; They were paying $ 18 for the $ 2,000 calls , that was quite a high volatility at 43 percent , &quot; another said . 
another main feature on Thursday was the $ 1,750 / $ 1,900 call spread which traded about 500 times . 
elsewhere , $ 1,700 puts was traded at 42 percent volatility . 
LIFFE coffee futures have been trading at a narrow $ 1,615 to $ 1,705 a tonne range this week with each side being capped by roaster buying at the lows and overhead origin selling . 
the contract saw a double top of just over $ 1,800 in early March . 
cocoa options remained subdued with little business reported . 
traders said July options were still keenly bid . 
July 1,200 stg calls were traded at 37 percent volatility on Thursday .
