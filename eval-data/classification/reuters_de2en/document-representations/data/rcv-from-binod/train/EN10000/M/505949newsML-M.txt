Tremours rumbled through Czech markets on Monday , as crown , debt , and equity traders were anxious about the contents of a government pro-growth package due out mid-week . 
the extent of budget cuts and measures affecting interest and exchange rates in the still-secret package -- aimed at stemming growing budget and trade deficits and reviving economic growth -- kept everybody in the markets guessing . 
the Czech crown fell to a 10-month low , losing 1.5 percent of its value trading late on Monday at 30.283 / dollar 17.568 / mark or about 0.75 percent below parity with the peg , from 29.290 and 17.439 , or + 0.80 on Friday . 
&quot; I think we &apos;ll see much nervousness on the markets ( until the cabinet &apos;s announcement ) -- forex , equity , and fixed income , &quot; said Vladimir Kreidl at Prague &apos;s Patria Finance . 
in thin activity on the Prague Stock Exchange , the blue-chip PX50 index dropped about 0.5 percent to 548.5 . 
&quot; Probably now , the nervousness around the government measures is a little bit distracting , &quot; said Lubomir Vystavel of ING Barings . 
the heaviest decliner among top shares was Komercni Banka , which fell 65 crowns , 2.8 percent , to 2,247 . 
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and other senior ministers have suggested a series of budget cuts along with a loosening in monetary policy , but specific details have not been revealed . 
the central bank responded last Thursday by easing minimum reserve requirements , but kept key interest rates unchanged . 
the Czech National Bank fixed the crown on Monday at 30.045 and 17.439 or + 0.04 percent above parity , as rates fluctuated wildly ahead of the daily fixing at 11.30 am ( 0930 GMT ) . 
the sharp fall in the crown did not give a reason for the CNB to intervene to prop up its value , the CTK news agency quoted CNB spokesman Martin Svehla as saying late on Monday . 
Central bank officials were not available for further comment . 
traders are debating whether the central bank , as a complicit part of the plan to be announced on Wednesday , would let the crown depreciate to help a worsening trade situation . 
the crown , which hit its high in February against the central bank &apos;s mark / dollar peg , has been especially sensitive as government pressure for an easing of monetary policy grows . 
&quot; Traders see the authorities as not opposing a weaker Czech crown , and the authorities are seeing the revaluation ( side of the central bank &apos;s fixing ) band , as overvalued , &quot; said Petr Korous , a trader at Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka . 
Korous said comments by Prime Minister Klaus over the weekend , hinting he was not happy with the crown &apos;s higher exchange rate levels , added more uncertainty . 
the government and the central bank have repeatedly ruled out a direct administrative devaluation of the crown in order to boost exports , although the country &apos;s current account deficit now is over eight percent of gross domestic product . 
when you see volatility like that , and it &apos;s across the board not just a few major players , that can be a bit of a problem , &quot; said one London-based analyst .
