in a mood of expectancy , any swallow makes a summer . 
received with great excitement were the credit creation and money supply growth figures for June for , although credit creation grew by 16.4 percent money supply ( M3 ) grew by only 12.8 percent , as compared with 15.3 percent in May and 16.5 percent in March . 
disregarding the fact that the annualised percentage change from the fourth quarter of 1996 base of the current guideline year of M3 , seasonally adjusted , was also 16.4 percent , this was generally interpreted as a marked downturn in the trend of money supply growth , bringing the expected interest rate cut that much closer . 
after all the Governor in a subsequent radio interview expressed himself as satisfied with the evident trends in money supply , inflation and foreign trade . 
two matters need to be addressed : the relationship between M3 and credit creation , and the particular immediate drop in the M3 percentage change . 
the Reserve Bank provides an analysis of changes in money supply . 
this is obtained by rearranging the consolidated assets and liabilities of the monetary sector , which embraces all the official and private sector monetary institutions . 
five broad categories are used in the analysis , namely credit creation , or more appropriately , the claims on the private sector ( assets ) , net assets abroad ( assets net of liabilities ) , net claims on government ( claims less government deposits ) , net other assets and other liabilities and M3 , the money supply in the hands of the domestic private sector ( cash in circulation plus demand and time deposits ) . 
the normal simplistic notion of money generation is through credit creation as the primary source , less absorption into government balances and less the net outflow on balance of payments account . 
this is the fundamental relationship but in practice there will be all manner of cross-relationships between the five factors . 
by ways of examples : 
increased bank claims on government through purchases of government stock and treasury bills can be offset by a rise in government deposits or result in a rise in private sector deposits . 
capitalised interest on overdrafts because of an inability to meet interest commitments will add to the claims on the public , but will not have its counterpart in a rise in money balances ; in the bank &apos;s books it could be balanced in an increase in other liabilities . 
normally claims on the public is a net stock figure after account is taken of repayments of debt , but if the redemption process is delayed or hampered - or deliberatley circumvented with parallel schemes of investing the capital instalments on mortgages in unit trusts - new credit will apparently accelerate the growth of credit creation without adding to money supply . 
normal repayment of debt both reduces money balances and bank claims on the public . 
the destruction of money balances through foreign payments can be matched by a growth of short-term foreign liabilities of the banks . 
this was a feature of 1996 when the private banking sector &apos;s foreign liabilities rose by 13 billion rand . 
but part of this was due to valuation changes with the collapse of the rand and in the bank &apos;s books the valuation adjustment would have been balanced by a reduction in other liabilities . 
disbursements from overdrafts can be in transit and therefore not be counterbalanced in money balances but in other liabilities . 
over the last five years the growth on money supply has been consistently lower than that of credit creation and , generally speaking , one of the major drains on the money supply in recent years has been through balance of payments as reflected in the large negative changes in net foreign assets . 
for 1996 in particular , whereas total claims on the private sector increased by 50.8 billion rand , money suply grew by 38.3 billion rand . 
there was a net drain in net foreign assets of 16.3 billion rnad , which destroyed money balances but for the element represented by valuation changes to short-term foreign liabilities . 
however , net claims on government grew 4.3 billion rand , which would have ended up as adding to the money supply . 
the arithmetic was squared up with a reduction in net other assets . 
the analysis for a particular month is unsatisfactory because of the large fluctuations in the residual net other assets and liabilities . 
thus for the latest month of June 1997 , whereas claims on the public grew by 7.8 billion rand , M3 fell by 0.5 billion rand . 
net claims on government fell by 2.6 billion largely because of a rise in government deposits absorbing money balances from the private sector . 
the rest of the explanation would lie with changes to net foreign assets and net other assets and other liabilities but these figures are not available as yet - between them there would be a negative of 5.7 billion rnad &quot; explaining &quot; the fall in money supply . 
but the changes in the month can quite easily be reversed restoring the growth in money supply . 
for example , money supply fell in January this year by 100 million rand but bounced back in February with a growth of 8.8 billion rand . 
furthermore , there is expected to be a run down in government balances in August when nearly nine billion rand in interest on government stock is due . 
clearly there can be no complacency about a downward trend in money supply having been established . 
the percentage change , year-on-year , in money supply was also markedly affected by the high base of June 1966 when , although increased claims on the public were much the same as for this June of 7.4 billion rand , money supply grew by 6.3 billion rand . 
we are , of course , assuming that the latest June figure , which is provisional , is correct . 
for the record it is of interest to note that over these last four-and-a-half years the growth of M1 , or cash and demand deposits , which is active money , has outstripped the growth of time depostis , or near-money by 105 percent to 57 percent . 
this would appear to belie the liquidity preference sensitivity to high interest rates but is more likely to reflect the transactions preference of a more integrated black involvement in the economy .
