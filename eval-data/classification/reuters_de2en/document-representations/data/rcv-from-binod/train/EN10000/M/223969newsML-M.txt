copper opened higher and wavered in a wide range for most of the session , but still up from Wednesday &apos;s close . 
traders said institutional support pushed the prices up from their lows but long and short position holders were mixed about the short-term market trend after sharp rises in the past few days . 
&quot; copper met strong resistance at about 21,500 but institutional buying supported it above yesterday &apos;s close , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; Many investors prefered to take their profits due to a fear of hedge selling at high levels , &quot; he added . 
traders said technical charts indicated the market was overbought and a lack of further positive news would prevent copper from standing above the 21,500 yuan level . 
&quot; Heavy gains over the past few days have divided opinions amongst long position holders and copper will find it impossible to breach the 21,500-yuan resistance level in the next few days despite institutional support , &quot; a second trader said . 
&quot; Poor domestic fundamentals will improve little in the short term , &quot; he added . 
analysts said copper was likely to test the 21,500-yuan level but chance of a breakthrough was minimal in the next few days .
