Cambodian co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh on Thursday called for the government to set a firm date for national elections and voiced a preference for polls in May 1998 . 
&quot; I would like to ask the Ministry of Interior to clearly state the exact date of elections -- what month , what day , &quot; Ranariddh said in a speech at a school graduation ceremony . 
&quot; For my part , I would like to request to have the elections in May 1998 , which would be in accordance with the elections in 1993 and the mandate of the National Assembly , &quot; he said . 
Cambodia held U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993 and under its constitution is due to hold another election in 1998 . 
the constitution specifies that polls be held every five years except in times of war or other special circumstances . 
but little progress has been made in preparing for the 1998 elections , government officials and analysts said . 
the election law has not been completed for consideration by the National Assembly , laws on political parties have not been drafted and Ranariddh and co-Premier Hun Sen have not agreed on a date for the polls , they said . 
earlier this year , Ranariddh and Hun Sen said November 1998 might be a possibility . 
the polls are expected to be fiercely contested by Ranariddh &apos;s royalist FUNCINPEC party and Hun Sen &apos;s ex-communist Cambodian People &apos;s Party . 
the two parties formed an uneasy coalition after the 1993 elections . 
the two leaders , who fell out last year over FUNCINPEC &apos;s demand for a greater share of power , have effectively been campaigning for some time . 
their increasingly acrimonious relationship has paralysed government and deadlocked the National Assembly , which has not met for months . 
Ranariddh urged the government to hurry an electoral law through the National Assembly , but analysts said that would be extremely difficult since the law-making process had ground to a halt .
