Indian global depositary receipts ( GDRs ) ended generally firmer on the back of the Bombay market but traders said activity was muted ahead of Friday &apos;s budget . 
&quot; It &apos;s been market-maker driven , &quot; said one GDR dealer after Thursday &apos;s mainly quiet session . 
&quot; Generally GDR prices closed firmer on the back of Bombay and investors are waiting to see what the budget brings . 
India &apos;s finance minister is due to announce the country &apos;s 1997-98 budget for the fiscal year starting on April 1 at 1130 GMT on Friday , and traders say they are looking for renewed commitment to economic reform . 
&quot; The big question is , will the second phase of the reform process be addressed , &quot; said one . 
&quot; The lack of political will to reach consensus agreement within such a large and fractious coalition government raises doubts on major reforms being pushed through , &quot; added Deepal Lalwani at Astaire &amp; Partners in London . 
&quot; Economic growth as a result may not be as good as predicted . 
reliance GDRs rose 50 cents to $ 15.50 ; SBI climbed 50 cents to $ 20.00 , while Bjaj Autos climbed $ 1.38 to $ 35.25 . 
the Bombay Stock Exchange 30-share index closed up 1.87 percent at 3427.87 . 
Korean GDRs eased in line with the Seoul share market , which weakened on rumours of financial difficulties at Sammi Corp and active selling by foreign investors . 
the Capel Korea GDR Index ended down 1.34 points , or 2.25 percent , at 58.22 , offering a premium of 34.46 percent over the local market . 
the Korea composite Index fell 10.30 points to end at 669.41 . 
Taiwan GDRs meanwhile followed the underlying market to a slightly higher close after signs of a gathering recovery triggered local bargain hunting . 
the Capel Taiwan GDR Index ended 2.19 points , or 2.18 percent higher at 102.58 , giving a premium of 1.24 percent over the local market . 
the Taiwan weighted Index rose 1.31 percent to 7,832.07 .
