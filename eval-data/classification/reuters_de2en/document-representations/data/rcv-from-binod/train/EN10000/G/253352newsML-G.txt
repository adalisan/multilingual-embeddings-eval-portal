Pope John Paul , responding to allegations that Roman Catholic nuns and priests took part in Rwanda &apos;s 1994 genocide , said on Thursday that the Church could not be held responsible . 
in a written address to Rwanda &apos;s new ambassador to the Vatican , Manzi Bakuramutsa , the Pope quoted from a letter he wrote to the people of Rwanda last March . 
in the letter the Pope responded indirectly to accusations priests and nuns took part in the genocide for the first time . 
&quot; All members of the Church who sinned during the genocide must have the courage to bear the consequences of the acts they committed against God and their fellow men , &quot; the Pope told the ambassador Bakuramutsa , quoting from his March letter . 
but he said the Roman Catholic Church as an institution could &quot; not be held responsible for the blame of these members ... who acted against the law of the Gospel . 
they will be called to account for their actions . 
the Pope told the ambassador he hoped that &quot; in seeking the responsibility for the drama that your country experienced , justice and equality should prevail at the judgment of persons accused of having taken part in the genocide . 
several Roman Catholic clergy were among up to one million minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus who were slaughtered in Rwanda &apos;s bloodletting . 
but the Catholic Church , the biggest denomination in Rwanda , has also faced accusations from eyewitnesses and the Kigali government that priests and nuns engaged or cooperated in the killings . 
some of the ugliest massacres were committed in churches , missions and parishes where Tutsis who took shelter were hunted down by extremist Hutu militias . 
the Pope told the ambassador that now that hundreds of thousands of refugees were returning home from Zaire , there was an urgent need for Rwandans to seek national unity and erase &quot; the resentment in their hearts &quot; . 
the Pope , who visited Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi in 1990 , said the people should now try to rebuild a national community where everyone could live in peace and mutual respect .
