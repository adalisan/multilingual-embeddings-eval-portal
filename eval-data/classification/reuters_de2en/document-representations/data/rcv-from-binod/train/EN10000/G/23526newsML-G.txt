Boxer Riddick Bowe &apos;s camp was fined $ 250,000 and his manager Rock Newman was banned from boxing events involving Bowe in New York for a year because of the July 11 melee at Madison Square Garden , the New York State Athletic Commission announced Thursday . 
Bowe and Newman will forfeit $ 250,000 of the purse earned for the fight , which Bowe won by disqualification over Andrew Golota of Poland . 
of that total , $ 200,000 will go to the state of New York and $ 50,000 to a charity named by the state athletic commission . 
Spencer promotions Inc , which is Newman &apos;s company , also had its promoter &apos;s license suspended until July 31 , 1997 . 
the fight came to a halt with 27 seconds left in the seventh round after Golota was disqualified for a series of low blows . 
Cornermen for the opposing fighters began brawling in the ring and the fight carried over to spectators . 
Bowe camp member Jason Harris , who was caught on videotape attacking Golota with a cellular phone , was permanently barred by the state commission from any employment relationship with Spencer or Bowe . 
Spencer promotions vice president Bernard brooks was barred from any employment relationship with Spencer or Bowe for one year . 
&quot; These penalties are unprecedented in the boxing community , &quot; said New York State Athletic Chairman Floyd Patterson . 
&quot; Clearly these disciplinary measures send the message that this type of violent and outrageous conduct will not be tolerated in our state . 
the commission recently rescinded its suspension of Lou Duva , Golota &apos;s manager .
