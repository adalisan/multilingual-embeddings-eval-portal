the Philippines was on the alert on Thursday for possible hitmen as top North Korean defector Hwang Jong-yap remained in hiding for a third day . 
a senior immigration official said his agents were keeping a close watch for North Koreans arriving at Manila and other airports . 
&quot; We &apos;re on the alert , &quot; said the official , asking not to be named . 
he said North Koreans were barred from entering the country unless they had visas . 
Manila and Pyongyang have no diplomatic relations . 
immigration agents displayed in their offices at Manila airport posters showing pictures of 22 alleged members of the Japanese Red Army guerrilla group , but did not say if this was part of security measures for Hwang . 
the Manila government has kept a veil of secrecy on the whereabouts of Hwang , the highest-ranking North Korean official to flee the Stalinist state , since China spirited him to the Philippines on Tuesday for a period of temporary asylum . 
President Fidel Ramos on Wednesday announced the Philippines was giving him temporary haven but &quot; only for as long as necessary and as short as possible &quot; . 
Ramos refused to say how long Hwang would stay but a senior South Korean official said in Seoul that Hwang would remain in the Philippines at least until the start of next month . 
&quot; China and South Korea have agreed on how long Hwang will have to stay in the Philippines . 
he will not be able to travel to South Korea within this month , &quot; the official , from South Korea &apos;s Foreign Ministry , told Reuters . 
Hwang languished for nearly five weeks in the South Korean consulate in Beijing since his defection on February 12 . 
mindful of the threat of assassins , officials maintained a total news blackout around Pyongyang &apos;s top ideologue . 
&quot; There are many factors to consider , &quot; Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon told reporters when asked when Hwang would leave for South Korea . 
&quot; You also have to look at the other factors , his present health condition , anxiety and other important considerations , &quot; Siazon added . 
asked if the Philippine action might antagonise North Korea , Siazon said : &quot; I hope not . 
&quot; We &apos;re trying to solve a problem for all of them . 
we are assisting them , we are helping them solve a problem among them . 
despite the Philippines &apos; reputation as a free-wheeling democracy where nothing of news value can stay secret for long , a Philippine presidential task force has successfully kept from the public the location of Hwang &apos;s hideaway . 
North Korea has a history of deadly attacks against arch-rival South Korea , with which it is still in Cold War confrontation . 
three days after Hwang sought asylum in Beijing , a North Korean defector was fatally shot near Seoul . 
he was found by assassins despite having had cosmetic surgery to hide his identity . 
&quot; In giving asylum to Hwang , the government has advanced our national interests by helping break a diplomatic impasse , &quot; the Philippine Daily Inquirer said in an editorial on Thursday . 
but Max Soliven , publisher of the Philippine Star newspaper , wrote that the sooner Hwang left for Seoul , the better it would be for Manila . 
North Koreans &quot; may be facing famine , starvation has afflicted the once-militant and aggressive country , but they haven &apos;t lost their skills at armed infiltration and espionage , &quot; Soliven said .
