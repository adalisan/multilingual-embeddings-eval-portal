crude tanker chartering in the key Middle East Gulf market picked up from last week &apos;s lull , London brokers said on Monday . 
other lifting sectors saw largely unchanged freight rates . 
by mid-afternoon , three ULCCs had been seen , with two finding employment to the West . 
Exxon &apos;s chartering of the Hellenic Embassy and Total &apos;s of the Berge broker at W47.5 was seen as typical of the Gulf-West rates . 
brokers said VLCC trips to Japan were unchanged at W57-58 , whilst vessels travelling eastwards could command around W54.5. 
&quot; There should be a marginal pickup in rates over the next week . 
activity has increased and things appear to be more optimistic , &quot; one broker said . 
rates for 80,000 tonners going cross-Med settled at around W97.5 , off W2.5 from previous done levels , as evidenced by Ursa &apos;s chartering of the Nissos Sifnos . 
in the inter-UKC sector rates droppped fractionally to W92.5 , on account of an increase in vessel availability within the region . 
three transatlantic trips were seen , with Exxon and Statoil both chartering vessels . 
Irving chartered a VLCC to carry 278,000 tonnes to Canada out of Mongstad on August 10 . 
the company also chartered a VLCC out of West Africa to load 260,000 tonnes for Canada in August . 
Caribbean rates settled at last done levels , with 70,000 tonners going up coast-U.S. at W147.5. 
&quot; The volume increase seen last week in this region has sustained its levels , thus leading to rates remaining quite high , &quot; a North American broker said .
