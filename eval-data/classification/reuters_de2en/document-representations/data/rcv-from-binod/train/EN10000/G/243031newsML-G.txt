unknown gunmen killed about 150 people in attacks on two communes in northern Sierra Leone less than a week after the government and rebels signed a civil war accord , witnesses said on Monday . 
separately , President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah vowed to crack down on frustrated Sierra Leone soldiers whom he said had resorted to deliberate acts of lawlessness in the bush to try to undermine the peace accord . 
he made no mention of the reported attack . 
military authorities in Freetown declined comment on reports of the Thursday attacks in Kubehuna and Magbenka in Tonkili district , about 90 miles ( 145 km ) north of the capital . 
the area is notorious for insecurity , including banditry , and neither the government nor Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) rebels ever really had a firm footing there . 
&quot; The unknown gunmen entered the towns and opened fire on civilians or macheted them , &quot; one witness said by telephone from the area . 
witnesses said about 150 people were killed . 
many of them were civilians who emerged from months of hiding in the bush after the RUF and the Freetown government signed a peace accord in Ivory Coast on November 30 . 
Thursday &apos;s attacks were the most serious reported violation of the peace accord . 
fighting in the last months before the Ivorian-brokered accord was confused , with civilians caught in the middle unable to tell if attackers were rebels , government soldiers out of line or the civilian militia , the Kamojors , backing the army . 
&quot; My government must now act fast against lawless soldiers to ensure the maintenance of law and order in this country especially now that the government and the RUF have signed a peace agreement , &quot; Tejan Kabbah told reporters on Monday . 
he said some soldiers unhappy with the peace deal resorted to &quot; acts in the bush calculated to generate a crisis of confidence between the RUF and myself &quot; . 
he said he had recently been receiving reports of men in Sierra Leone army uniform ambushing civilian cars heading towards the north of the country . 
&quot; Six soldiers recently ambushed a vehicle transferring money to a bank in Makeni in the north of the country . 
one of the soldiers has already been arrested and the police and the military are searching for the other five , &quot; he said .
