Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian man and wounded 11 people in a West Bank village on Sunday during an Arab protest against land confiscations , witnesses and a doctor said . 
they said the incident occurred in Deir Kidis village near Ramallah where Palestinians say the Israelis confiscated 1,250 acres ( 500 hectares ) for a Jewish settlement . 
a doctor at Ramallah hospital who declined to be identified said Atallah Amireh , 36 , died of gunshot wounds in the head and chest and 11 other Palestinians were wounded . 
the doctor said two of the wounded were in critical condition . 
an army spokesman said the incident was under investigation . 
witnesses said violence erupted when Israeli soldiers blocked a demonstration by about 200 Palestinians from four villages who were heading for a protest on the conficated land . 
&quot; The soldiers called on the people to return and blocked their way , but demonstrators refused , so the army shot at demonstrators &apos; legs and chests , &quot; one witness said . 
Israel still occupies much of the West Bank after having handed over most of its cities to Palestinian self-rule under peace deals with the PLO . 
the confiscation of Arab land by Israel has led to clashes and deaths in the past . 
the PLO insists the confiscations for settlements and roads violate the interim peace deals . 
Israel maintains the issue of settlements is only to be resolved in future final-status talks . 
&quot; Israel has to immediately stop its settlements expansion policy because it will lead to bloody clashes and it &apos;s illegal and it is a violation of all signed peace deals , &quot; said chief PLO negotiator Saeb Erekat .
