the Bulgarian Lev rebound to 231-232 per dollar at midday from 235-236 at the opening due to foreign currency sales by the Bulgarian National Bank ( BNB ) on the domestic interbank market , dealers said . 
&quot; The central bank started dollar sales initially at 232 ( levs per dollar ) and later at 231 around midday , when the Lev was headed to fall beyond 236 on rising demand , &quot; a commercial bank dealer said . 
the central bank sold dollars on the market through several commercial banks in volumes between $ 200,000 and $ 300,000 per bank , dealers said . 
Central bank officials declined comment . 
according to traders some final clients were also offering dollars to the market , further boosting supply . 
if foreign currency supply remains around its relatively higher levels the Lev may remain stable around 230 until the close . 
the Lev opened at 235-236 to the dollar , down from Thursday &apos;s close of 234-235 , in low volumes . 
dollar sales by the BNB on Thursday contained the Lev &apos;s fall to 12 levs from Wednesday &apos;s close of 222-223 .
