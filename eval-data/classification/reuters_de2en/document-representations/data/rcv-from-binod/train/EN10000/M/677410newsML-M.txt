Australin wool prices rose on average by a further four percent this week at sales in Sydney , Adeliade and Fremantle , the Australian Council of wool Exporters said on Friday . 
the two day selling schedule in each centre saw the market easing marginally on the second day after overheating on the first day where it appeared that a degree of panic buying occurred , it said in its weekly market review . 
the eastern market indicator jumped 27 cents to end at 753 cents a kg clean , after touching a two-year high of 755 cents , while the western indicator rose 26 cents to 692 cents a kg . 
a total of 71,796 bales were offered with a pass in rate of six percent . 
&quot; Widespread competition from local processors and overseas markets for limited supplies was the continuing feature of auction sales , &quot; the council said . 
it said the continuing depreciation of the Australian dollar helped cushion the effect of higher prices for overseas buyers . 
the dollar has depreciated by 15 percent against the yen and by 4.5 percent against the US dollar since early May 1997 , when the eastern market indicator was at 678 cents a kg clean , it said . 
wool International said it sold 32,814 bales of stockpile wool in the the week , 94 percent of which was for September quarter delivery , and cut its stockpile to 1,573,860 bales . 
in the futures market , a total of 414 contracts were traded in the 21 micron contract in the week ended June 19 and open interest increased by 12 contracts to close at 1,237 . 
the near August contract closed 39 cents up at 926 cents a kg clean . 
sales continue next week in Sydney and Melbourne with 72,000 bales rostered .
