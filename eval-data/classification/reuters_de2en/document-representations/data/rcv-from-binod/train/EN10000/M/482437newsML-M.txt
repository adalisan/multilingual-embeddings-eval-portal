Danish share prices closed a fraction higher on Wednesday , with dealers seeing levels holding in a wary market until the U.S. data at the end of the week . 
&quot; Investors are cautious ahead of the American data so I don &apos;t see the KFX index moving much tomorrow in any direction or anything very dramatic happening . 
tomorrow &apos;s turnover will be low just like today , &quot; one dealer said . 
the KFX top-20 index gained a marginal 0.05 point or 0.03 percent to close at 152.75 in overall bourse turnover of 719 million crowns . 
the KFX June future rose 0.90 point to 151.40 with 60 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded . 
Unidanmark was the day &apos;s most traded paper with 195,000 shares changing hands , to close four crowns down at 335 .
