Polish shares inched up on Wednesday , piercing the psychological barrier of 16,000 points , and analysts said investor optimism signalled by strong buying after price-fixing could set another 33-month high on Thursday . 
analysts said the bourse was being buoyed by optimism that was difficult to explain . 
some said the growth might have been provoked by rises on world exchanges . 
the main market &apos;s WIG index rose 53.8 points , or 0.3 percent , to 16,033.1 , and turnover fell 7.3 percent to 162.7 million zlotys ( $ 56.1 million ) on both markets with 38 issues falling , 34 rising and 14 staying flat . 
&quot; There should be another growth tomorrow ... I think it &apos;s no use explaining it rationally ... it &apos;s all about psychology , &quot; said Pawel Tarnowski , an analyst at Raiffeisen Capital and Investment Polska . 
analysts said it was impossible to try to find resistance for the bourse , which has been recording its highest levels this month since March 1994 . 
some said they expected growth extending for a few weeks with possible phases of stabilisation or profit-taking corrections , which would not stop the overall growth .
