not in their wildest dreams could Nantes have hoped earlier in a remarkable season that they would bring down the curtain on the French first division championship in a top-of-the-table clash with champions Monaco on Saturday . 
the title was decided three weeks ago when Monaco , now 12 points ahead of Nantes and third-placed Paris St Germain , clinched their sixth crown . 
but with the runners-up also qualifying for an expanded European Cup , the interest and excitement have persisted to the final day thanks in no small measure to a Nantes team who did not win in their opening 10 games but are subsequently unbeaten in 30 . 
PSG , beaten in the European Cup Winners &apos; Cup final by Barcelona 10 days ago and having accepted in mid-season that they could not catch Monaco in the league title race , had set their sights on the prize of second place . 
but arch-rivals Marseille , playing only for their pride , beat them 1-0 at the velodrome last weekend while Nantes defeated Montpellier 3-0 at home to overtake the Parisians on goal difference and snatch the initiative . 
Nantes were 17th , 19 points behind then leaders PSG after 12 matches in mid October . 
PSG players this week stoked up the tension by suggesting the transfer to Monaco of Nantes top scorer Japhet N &apos;Doram next season could have a bearing on the outcome of the match in the principality &apos;s Stade Louis II . 
N &apos;Doram responded by saying : &quot; I &apos;ve always been very frank and very honest in football and outside ( the game ) , so it shocks me that people could suspect ( anything ) . 
coach Jean-Claude Suaudeau , whose captain Jean-Michel Ferri is out after sustaining an injury against Montpellier , commented in something of an understatement : &quot; The clash between a team that has been winning for 30 matches and a champion side is definitely interesting , especially considering that Monaco have not lost at home ( in the league ) this season . 
Monaco will want to close the championship on a good note , the more so after the disappointment among their players of having only goalkeeper Fabien Barthez picked for France &apos;s World Cup warm-up tournament next month . 
their coach Jean Tigana was annoyed at the hints from the capital that they might not put everything into the match . 
&quot; We &apos;re going to play to win , as usual . 
we have prepared for that and , on top , everyone wants to play this match . 
it &apos;s the last match at Monaco , it &apos;s going to be a party , &quot; he said . 
some are already disappointed . 
Martin Djetou , Belgium &apos;s Enzo Scifo and Marco Grassi of Switzerland are all injured , while top scorer Sonny Anderson and defenders Martin Djetou and Gilles Grimandi depend on late fitness tests . 
Tigana added : &quot; We have our unbeaten home record to preserve and then there is a kind of respect we must have towards Nantes and also towards our profession . 
Nantes forward Jocelyn Gourvennec pointed a finger north when he said : &quot; One could turn the argument around . 
Strasbourg , who play in Paris , have nothing left to fear or hope for . 
Strasbourg , as League Cup winners , have already ensured a place in the UEFA Cup , which is the smaller prize that either PSG or Nantes will be left with on Saturday . 
Bordeaux , bidding for one of the two other UEFA Cup places , are away to a Le Havre side unbeaten in their last four matches . 
Rolland Corbis &apos;s side will want to secure their place with a victory but have been unsettled in midweek with confirmation that their coach leaves for Marseille at the end of the season and that France midfielder Ibrahim Ba , who joined Bordeaux from Le Havre last year , is set to move abroad . 
Courbis , whose team scraped a 2-2 draw at home to Lyon last weekend , said : &quot; I &apos;d never have thought it was so difficult to qualify for Europe .
