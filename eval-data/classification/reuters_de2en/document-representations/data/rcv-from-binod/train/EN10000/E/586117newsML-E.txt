trade and foreign ministers from across the Americas gathered for talks on Thursday in Brazil &apos;s third-largest city , which is famous for its cheese bread , chaotic traffic and beautiful women . 
the city of two million people is calling itself &quot; the Capital of the Americas &quot; this week , though most of its inhabitants say they have no idea what all the fuss is about . 
&quot; What we &apos;re famous for is the Minas Gerais hospitality , as well as our women , food and cultural life , &quot; said Belo Horizonte Mayor Celio de Castro . 
officials and businessmen from 34 of the hemisphere &apos;s nations --a ll but Cuba -- met to discuss the creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas , a bold plan to knock down tariffs by 2005 in a region of one billion consumers . 
Belo Horizonte , meaning beautiful horizon , is one of Brazil &apos;s wealthiest cities at the heart of a mineral-rich region . 
its economy has traditionally been based on mining , coffee-growing and textiles , but now services are important . 
the Meeting of the Americas has been a boon to the local economy . 
with more than 2,000 businessmen in town , along with some 600 journalists and several hundred government officials , taxi drivers and restaurants were enjoying a roaring trade . 
judging from the late-night traffic through at least one hotel lobby , so were the escort agencies . 
Mayor Castro said the city spent $ 4 million on prettifying the park near the &quot; Palace of the Arts &quot; where the main negotiations were taking place . 
it spent another $ 10 million on public works not directly related to the meeting . 
&quot; It &apos;s something different . 
a big event like this doesn &apos;t happen every day here , &quot; said 14-year-old Kenya Cristina , who was interviewing delegates for a project on the FTAA . 
but she conceded with a grin : &quot; I don &apos;t really know what it is . 
city officials said they hoped the media spotlight on the talks would change that .
