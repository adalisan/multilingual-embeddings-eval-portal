on April 19 , 1995 , shaken currency dealers and world leaders gaped as the dollar crashed to a record low of 79.75 yen . 
now , two years later , it is the yen &apos;s turn to struggle as the buck struts mightily at its highest level in over four years . 
but even though the dollar has risen almost 60 percent from its 1995 abyss , Tokyo dealers say its future course is murky . 
&quot; The dollar was on a falling trend for roughly five years , but it has been rising for only two . 
two years is far too short to say it has fully recovered , &quot; said Akira Kurihara , chief dealer at Norinchukin Bank . 
he added that although further gains for the greenback are possible , a recent spate of official comments hinting at dollar-selling intervention and a Group of Seven ( G7 ) meeting later this month have the potential to reverse its course . 
Eisuke Sakakibara , head of the Finance Ministry &apos;s International Finance Bureau and known as &quot; Mr yen &quot; for his role in the dollar &apos;s comeback , on Friday expressed concern about the yen &apos;s movements , which he called &quot; too rapid &quot; , and said recent currency moves could not be justified by economic fundamentals . 
he said on Wednesday he shared U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin &apos;s view that authorities should intervene when appropriate . 
&quot; We will intervene when we think we can win . 
the last dollar-selling intervention was carried out by the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) in August 1992 , when the dollar was near 128 yen . 
it hit 127.16 yen last week , its highest since then , and was at about 125.85 yen on Friday afternoon . 
but the market is sceptical about how effective such moves would be now , particularly if the BOJ moved alone . 
two years ago intervention was also a hot topic . 
but then it was buying of the dollar to try and halt its plunge , with several joint interventions by world central banks and massive solo moves by the BOJ unable to stave off the record low . 
&quot; ( The effectiveness ) of Japan intervening alone would depend on how they do it . 
if they talk a lot and do ( intervene ) a little , it won &apos;t be effective , as it wasn &apos;t in 1995 , &quot; said Mineko Sasaki-Smith , chief economist at CS First Boston . 
few in the market feel other central banks would join with the BOJ in selling dollars , despite recent remarks by Rubin hinting at U.S. concerns over the dollar &apos;s current level . 
&quot; In 1995 , it was clear that the weak dollar was not good for the whole world . 
but now the U.S. is more concerned with controlling inflation , and even though there have been some complaints about the dollar from exporters , this is not enough of an incentive , &quot; Norinchukin &apos;s Kurihara said . 
trade issues dominated in 1995 , with Washington and Tokyo close to a trade war over lack of progress in car talks , but faded as a major factor in 1996 as Japan &apos;s surplus shrank . 
but now there are hints of fresh tension . 
in the latest of a barrage of U.S. warnings , Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers warned on Thursday of trade friction unless Japan became less reliant on exports and promotes growth from within . 
his comments were emphasised by data showing that despite a decrease in Japan &apos;s overall March trade surplus , its surplus with the United States rose 11.2 percent from a year earlier . 
but Sasaki-Smith said recent pledges from Rubin that currencies will not be used as a trade tool are one improvement over 1995 . 
there was suspicion in Japan then that Washington was tolerating a weak dollar to wring concessions from Japan . 
&quot; It does seem now as if there is more sense of solidarity between central banks , particularly Japan and the U.S. , &quot; said Yasuhito Kawashima , chief manager at Toyo Trust &amp; Banking . 
in 1995 , it was a G7 meeting that finally turned the tide by issuing a joint statement calling for an &quot; orderly reversal &quot; of currency movements . 
but while the market is wary of aggressively buying the dollar ahead of the G7 meeting in late April , few think much action is likely this time . 
Sasaki-Smith said : &quot; The dollar would have to rise massively . 
if it &apos;s at its current level then , I don &apos;t see them doing anything .
