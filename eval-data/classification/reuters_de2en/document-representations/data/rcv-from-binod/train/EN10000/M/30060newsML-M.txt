Indian bond issues , becoming popular against depressed equity markets , are seen gaining ground as more and more investors switch to debt , India &apos;s premier credit rating agency chief said on Tuesday . 
&quot; We strongly believe that the debt market will happen and in a big way , &quot; R. Ravimohan , managing director of Credit Rating Information Services of India Ltd ( CRISIL ) told an investment conference . 
in the past few months , new bond floats have mopped up 55 billion rupees . 
Ravimohan said the Indian debt market had seen a resurgence in debt issues over the past two years indicating investor disappointment over the performance of the country &apos;s stock markets . 
concerns over political stability -- with the advent of a new government last June -- , a liquidity crunch and a diasappointing 1996 / 97 budget have dragged down equities in the last couple of months , analysts said . 
&quot; Portfolio allocation between equity and debt has most certainly become a recent phenomenon for retail investors , &quot; Ravimohan said .
