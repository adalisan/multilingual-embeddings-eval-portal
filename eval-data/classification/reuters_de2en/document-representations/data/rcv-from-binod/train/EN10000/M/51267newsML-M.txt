the Australian share market flew home in the last hour of trading on Friday to close barely a whisker off the day &apos;s highs . 
the All Ordinaries index jumped 15.7 points to close at 2,252.3 while September share price index futures rose 14 points to end at 2,250 , a 2.3 point discount to the underlying index . 
citing short selling and active trading in BHP warrants , brokers said the late rush of blood had startled the bourse out of its Friday afternoon , pre-weekend stupor . 
&quot; It really kicked up at the end with a lot of short covering in BHP shares and solid trade in the warrants , &quot; said dealer Peter Struk of Reynolds and Co . 
other players echoed similar sentiments , saying Thursday &apos;s selldown in the miners had been overdone . 
&quot; There was plenty of plays between warrants and the ( BHP ) shares but really it was a case of Thursday being overdone , &quot; said a Sydney-based dealer . 
their result came in around what we expected and they are looking better further down the track , &quot; he said . 
with the results season reaching its climax today , the major result came from conglomerate Pacific Dunlop whose full year loss of A $ 132.74 million ( US $ 106 million ) was within expectations and caused few flutters . 
on the plus side , though , the company said it had secured extra equity commitments to its recapitalisation plan and had received written indications from its U.S. bondholders to allow the plan to proceed . 
rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about four to three , while about 29 percent of stocks traded remained steady .
