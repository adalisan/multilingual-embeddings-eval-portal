a powerful new U.S. Air Force Titan 4B rocket , developed at a cost of $ 1 billion , roared into space on Sunday , making its maiden flight . 
Nestled in its bulbous nose cone was a $ 200 million missile warning satellite . 
&quot; We have ignition and liftoff of the Titan 4B , &quot; said an Air Force launch commentator . 
the new rocket is the result of a 9-year , $ 1 billion upgrade for the Titan 4 , the workhorse of the U.S. military space program . 
it will primarily be used to launch spy satellites , but will also be employed by NASA in October to launch it &apos;s nuclear-powered Cassini probe to Saturn . 
improved and enlarged twin solid rocket motors , constructed from light-weight composite materials , have increased the rocket &apos;s cargo capacity by 25 percent . 
in its most powerful configuration the rocket can loft 48,000 lbs ( 21,770 kgs ) into low earth orbit . 
aviation Week &amp; Space Technology magazine described the rocket &apos;s maiden flight as &quot; one of the most important Air Force space missions ever conducted . 
nine minutes after blastoff the missile warning satellite separated from the Titan . 
a two-stage rocket was to fire later to place the satellite into a stationary orbit 22,300 miles ( 35,900 kms ) above the equator . 
similar satellites were used in the Gulf War to detect Iraqi Scud missile launches . 
it &apos;s sensitive instruments are capable of detecting the exhaust heat of a jet aircraft on afterburner .
