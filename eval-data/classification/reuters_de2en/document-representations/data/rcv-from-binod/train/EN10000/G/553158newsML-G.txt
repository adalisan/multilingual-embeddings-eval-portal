after Germany &apos;s 2-0 win over Ukraine on Wednesday night , a reporter asked Bayer Leverkusen &apos;s Jens Nowotny why he had not swapped shirts with an opponent . 
&quot; Nobody wanted my shirt , &quot; joked the 23-year-old , who won his first cap in the World Cup qualifier . 
like most of his side , the young Leverkusen captain is hardly a household name . 
but that could quickly change if his second-placed club can seize the chance to pile the pressure on Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich this weekend . 
Leverkusen , three points behind Bayern , face Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday - a day before Bayern take on local rivals 1860 Munich in the Olympic Stadium . 
a win for Nowotny and his team mates would put them level on points with Bayern , who would then need a win in a tough derby game to preserve their cushion at the top . 
if anyone is capable of exerting pychological pressure on Bayern , it is Leverkusen coach Christoph Daum . 
Daum , who has transformed Leverkusen from last season &apos;s relegation candidates since he arrived in the off-season , consults regularly with a psychologist on how best to deal with his players and has a wide range of literature on the subject . 
the coach begins building up players for their next game right at the beginning of each week - and always has a few tricks up his sleeve when it comes to the art of motivation . 
&quot; I can &apos;t just keep everything relaxed all week and then jump on the table on Saturday and shout : &apos; Right lads , here we go ! 
before last month &apos;s key match against VfB Stuttgart , Daum compiled a video of Leverkusen &apos;s best goals of the season . 
the coach played the tape on the team bus on the way to the stadium to boost his players &apos; confidence . 
the trick seemed to work - Leverkusen won 2-1 . 
similarly , to make his team concentrate on recent opponents Arminia Bielefeld , Daum made the players write down the likely Bielefeld line-up . 
Leverkusen won that game 1-0 . 
Daum , naturally , is keeping his tricks for the Moenchengladbach game close to his chest . 
but he has already started to exploit his own team &apos;s role as outsiders in the championship race to pile the pressure on Bayern . 
&quot; Bayern have played more internationals than we &apos;ve played Bundesliga games , &quot; Daum said . 
&quot; They &apos;re the league leaders so it will be totally normal if they win the championship . 
if Daum can manage to keep the pressure on Bayern and keep motivating his own players so successfully , then Jens Nowotny &apos;s shirts could be a lot more sought-after in the near future .
