forecasts have been revised up to a median of 0.5 percent quarterly growth from 0.3 percent earlier this month , after the stronger than expected company profits data on Thursday . 
Capex and inventories data will see these forecasts fine-tuned further , but they suggest a reasonable base for growth through 1997 , economists said . 
while the profits data was revised up for a number of previous quarters , economists were reluctant to say it meant historical GDP data would also be upwardly revised because the profits data does not flow through fully to GDP and there may be some downward revisions to other GDP components which could cancel the stronger profits data .

but economists said it had been so strong previously that some moderate numbers could be expected . 
as well , attention is likely to be focused on the forward estimates for clues as to how investment is expected to perform over the remainder of the 1996 / 97 year . 
along with inventory data , it remains one of the last partial indicators of fourth quarter GDP to be released . 
the wages data will be important because it provides a public / private sector breakdown , as weel as industry data . 
the preliminary data was boosted by a large increase in female earnings , which economists said suggested public sector wages may have grown most in the quarter . 
this is seen as less of a concern than private sector wages growth , which is seen as potentially more inflationary .
