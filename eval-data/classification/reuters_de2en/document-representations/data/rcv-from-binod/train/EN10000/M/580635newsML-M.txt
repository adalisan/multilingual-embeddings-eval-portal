the Taiwan dollar closed at an 11-month low against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday , as political jitters ahead of a planned cabinet reshuffle spurred a foreign funds outflow begun on Monday , dealers said . 
it was the rate &apos;s lowest close since it finished at T $ 27.790 on June 8 , 1996 . 
the dollar had fallen sharply on Monday against the greenback , driven down by the withdrawal of millions of dollars in foreign equity from the plunging stock market . 
share prices again fell on Tuesday , but by only 0.18 percent -- far less than Monday &apos;s huge 3.72 percent selloff . 
anti-government sentiment in Taiwan erupted in April following the kidnap and murder of a famous actress &apos;s teenage daughter , triggering widespread calls for a cabinet reshuffle and the resignation of Premier LIEN Chan . 
LIEN , who said on Monday he would resign in July , was expected to propose a mild cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday . 
Parliament narrowly defeated an opposition-sponsored motion that would have urged President Lee Teng-hui to sack LIEN and order a sweeping cabinet reshuffle . 
&quot; The political concerns right now are causing the Taiwan dollar to depreciate , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; But it is a depreciation which the government , and the central bank in particular , does not mind seeing , &quot; he added . 
many dealers and analysts believe the government welcomes a modest depreciation of the Taiwan dollar , which would spur exports -- the island &apos;s economic lifeblood .
