implied volatilities for dollar / mark options were strongly higher in U.S. trading after the spot mounted an assault on 1.82 marks in Europe . 
&quot; It seems like a knee-jerk reaction to the spot move , &quot; said one U.S. options trader . 
after opening firm in the U.S. at 10.65 / 10.75 percent , one-month dollar / mark volatility continued well bid , gaining an additional 0.1 percentage point by midday , said a New York-based broker . 
from late Monday , the one-month bid is up 0.75 percentage point . 
the one-month 25-delta risk reversal widened to 0.7 / 1.0 favoring mark puts from 0.3 / 0.6 . 
persistent sentiment the euro will be a soft currency propelled the dollar to a fresh 71-month peak at 1.8197 marks . 
options traders called the rise in volatility relatively restrained given that spot dollar / mark broke above its range . 
&quot; There doesn &apos;t seem to be an overreaction , &quot; said the New York broker . 
&quot; We &apos;re waiting to see if we can sustain the dollar above 1.82 against the mark . 
such a move could ignite volatility in the pair , driving away potential sellers , traders said . 
but for now , they noted , activity in the spot was overshadowing everything else . 
&quot; There has been no leap into buying options , &quot; said the New York broker . 
in addition to worrying about whether dollar strength is sustainable , market participants are reluctant to establish positions before Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s Humphrey-Hawkins testimony is heard , traders said . 
Greenspan will present his views on monetary policy and the U.S. economy before a House subcommittee starting at 1400 EDT . 
the volatile U.S. stock market is another wildcard . 
traders said interest was concentrated in the very short dates and in the longer dates . 
one-year dollar / mark volatility climbed to 10.5 / 10.6 percent from 10.0 / 10.3 quoted late Monday . 
in dollar / yen , market talk attributed pressure on the spot dollar to a large foreign bank &apos;s defense of a knockout option with an upside trigger at 116.50 yen . 
one-month dollar / yen volatility rose 0.3 percentage point to 10.0 / 10.3 percent and one-year gained 0.1 point to 10.7 / 10.9 percent . 
one-month risk reversals retained a slight skew for yen calls at 0.4 / 0.6 , unchanged from the previous day .
