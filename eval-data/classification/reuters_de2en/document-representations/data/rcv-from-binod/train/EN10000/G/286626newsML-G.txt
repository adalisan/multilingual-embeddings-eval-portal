China &apos;s future garrison in Hong Kong is so eager to see the territory &apos;s return to Beijing rule it is ensuring the troops do not forget the great event even for a moment , the People &apos;s Liberation Army Daily said on Friday . 
troops to be stationed in Hong Kong after the transfer of power at midnight on June 30 have placed a huge clock on their headquarters marking the time remaining until sovereignty changes hands , the newspaper said . 
a flag pole at the soldiers &apos; barracks stood exactly 19.97 metres high and one military van to be sent to Hong Kong had a licence plate reading &quot; 1997 &quot; , it said . 
&quot; Every soldier to be stationed in Hong Kong can feel the solemn moment approaching step by step , &quot; it said . 
China has crowed that the return of Hong Kong after more than 150 years of British colonial rule will make 1997 one of the most significant in modern Chinese history . 
Beijing has trumpeted the sophistication of the garrison and has required troops to take classes on how to behave politely and how to speak the Cantonese dialect which is widely used in Hong Kong . 
it has tried to reassure Hong Kong residents that the military presence in the territory will be benign and erase any lingering memories of the army &apos;s bloody crackdown on student-led demonstrators in Beijing on June 4 , 1989 .
