U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets early Thursday were gearing for active trading following lackluster sales going into the New Years holiday on Wednesday , feedlot sources said . 
Packer buyers reportedly phoned feedlots early with bids of $ 66.00 per cwt . 
however , the bids were passed with owners generally pricing cattle at $ 68.00 , but some were anticipating $ 67.00 , especially after light sales at that level on Tuesday in Kansas , sources said . 
about 1,000 head of steers and heifers likely to grade select and choice Tuesday sold at $ 67.00 in Kansas . 
the price was up $ 1.00 from last week &apos;s top , sources there said . 
no sales were reported Tuesday in the Texas Panhandle area . 
fed cattle prices were seen supported by active post-holiday buying by packers needing live inventories for early next week , cattle feeders said . 
bullish enthusiasm , however , could be diffused by weakness in beef prices as retailers finish booking orders for first-half January promotions , they said .
