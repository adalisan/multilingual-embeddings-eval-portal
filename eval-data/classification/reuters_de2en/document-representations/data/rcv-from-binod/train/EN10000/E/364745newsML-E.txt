the once free-spending Japanese are hitting the shops less than expected ahead of a planned sales tax increase , leading to worries over the economic outlook for the rest of the year . 
in its monthly economic report released on Friday , the government said business had grown more gloomy about the future . 
April 1 is widely seen as huge punctuation mark for the economy . 
the government , desperate to cut fiscal spending , is due then to increase the sales tax to five percent from three percent and to put an end to special income tax cuts . 
the economy is widely expected to shrink in the April-June quarter and then to begin to pick up after consumer demand recovers . 
this expectation has prompted the government to predict that growth in the 1997 / 98 fiscal year will total just 1.9 percent -- the lowest official figure in four decades . 
although the business year begins in April , some economists have expressed dismay at the unexpected lack of shopping energy to beat the sales tax increase . 
a six percent plunge in Tokyo stocks in January and a weakening yen amid renewed fears about the economy and the long-ailing banking sector are already affecting consumers , they say . 
&quot; The fall in stocks has landed a direct hit on consumer sentiment , &quot; said Mineko Sasaki-Smith , chief economist at CS First Boston . 
in its monthly report , the government &apos;s Economic Planning Agency ( EPA ) did not change its assessment of a gradually recovering economy . 
however an EPA official said that while there was insufficient evidence to say consumer spending had worsened , there were elements &quot; which need to be looked at cautiously &quot; . 
one of which was that the expected buying spree in the run-up to April seemed to be confined only to the larger purchases in life . 
&quot; The rush to buy is so far only obvious in cars and housing . 
it is not as though consumers have been swept up in a buying frenzy , &quot; said the official . 
wage growth of 0.5 percent year-on-year in December was lower than expected and slightly worrying , he said , but added that this might just reflect delays in winter bonus payments . 
some economists were more pessimistic . 
&quot; The government &apos;s outlook seems a little naive , &quot; said Takao Endoh , senior managing director at Asahi Investment Trust Management . 
economists said wage growth would remain low and also cited declines in retail sales during December . 
preliminary figures for sales at department store outlets open at least a year fell one percent after increases of more than three percent in October and November . 
&quot; There &apos;s not as much strength in the buying spree as expected . 
it &apos;s a case of consumers worried about the economy in the future and not having the confidence in their purchasing power , &quot; said CS First Boston &apos;s Sasaki-Smith . 
yet others said special factors were also at work . 
Yasuyuki Komaki , an economist at NLI Research Institute said the recovery in consumer spending was extremely gradual but it was not necessarily that bad because December sales had been depressed by this year &apos;s unusually warm winter .
