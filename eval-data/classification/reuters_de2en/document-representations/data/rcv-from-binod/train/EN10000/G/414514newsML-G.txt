Peru &apos;s government and Marxist rebels on Monday began fresh talks amid heightened speculation about a bloodless end to Lima &apos;s 76-day hostage crisis after President Alberto Fujimori &apos;s whirlwind two-nation crisis tour . 
Fujimori was due to head home after a surprise trip to Havana for talks with Cuban leader Fidel Castro , who Fujimori said agreed to grant asylum to Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) rebels if all sides agreed . 
&quot; Cuba is willing to cooperate in the framework for this asylum but not to participate as a mediator , &quot; said Fujimori , who arrived in Havana after visiting the Dominican Republic . 
some 20 MRTA rebels are holding 72 mostly middle-aged captives at the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence in Lima in Latin America &apos;s longest hostage crisis . 
Fujimori &apos;s comments at a Havana news conference confirmed weeks of speculation that Cuba may be asked to give refuge to the rebels as part of a possible deal to end the siege . 
Fujimori quoted Castro as saying the communist island would be willing to take the Cuban-inspired rebels if it received a formal request from the Peruvian government , the Japanese government , crisis mediators and the rebels . 
in Lima , mediators and government negotiators strolled into a safehouse across the street from the captured residence for the start of the eighth round of face-to-face crisis talks . 
Minutes later , a white Red Cross Sedan with dark windows ferried a rebel believed to be MRTA chief Nestor Cerpa to the house from the diplomatic compound as rebels in the mansion sang a revolutionary hymn . 
after singing , they shouted twice : &quot; What is our goal on the 76th day ? 
free the prisoners ! 
the fatherland or death ! 
the talks are being mediated by guarantors from the Red Cross , the Vatican , and the Canadian government , as well as an observer from the Japanese government . 
earlier on Monday , police moved armoured personnel carriers and sharpshooters into position around the besieged mansion . 
the news from Cuba offered renewed optimism to the latest round of talks , the first since Thursday . 
but Fujimori &apos;s news was preceded by a denial from the MRTA spokesman in Europe that rebels would seek asylum outside Peru . 
&quot; We are not thinking about leaving Peru , &quot; spokesman Isaac Velasco told reporters in Pamplona , Spain , where he was attending a book presentation . 
news reports for weeks have touted Cuba , as well as the Dominican Republic , Nicaragua and Eastern Europe , as possible places of asylum for the hostage-takers as part of a bloodless solution to the crisis . 
Peruvian media reported on Monday that the Dominican Republic may take six of the rebels . 
Fujimori had been thought to be returning to Lima on Monday after leaving Santo Domingo , where he held a 3 1 / 2 hour meeting on Sunday with President Leonel Fernandez . 
but Peru-based journalists who travelled on a separate plane to cover Fujimori &apos;s trip to the Dominican Republic were caught completely by surprise when they arrived in Havana just before the Peruvian leader . 
while ruling out the rebels &apos; main demand -- the release of 400 jailed comrades -- Fujimori has indicated he might make other concessions .
