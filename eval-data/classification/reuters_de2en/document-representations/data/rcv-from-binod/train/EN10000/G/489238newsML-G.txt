a visiting U.S. Roman Catholic cardinal , Boston Archbishop Bernard Law , said on Saturday he hoped the church could play a role improving long hostile relations between Cuba and the United States . 
&quot; There is always hope that it ( the church ) can be a bridge , because there really is no other organisation that is as present globally as the church , &quot; Law told reporters after presiding over a morning mass for young people at a Havana church with Cuba &apos;s Cardinal Jaime Ortega . 
law , on a private visit to Cuba , added that the U.S. church has strong ties with the Cuban Catholic church , and said the U.S. church would help in any way possible its Cuban counterpart prepare for the visit next January of Pope John Paul . 
law said that the papal visit would be &quot; very significant &quot; and should serve to further improve relations between the island &apos;s communist authorities and the church . 
he added that the organisation of the visit provided a &quot; unique opportunity &quot; for cooperation at a high level between the state and the church . 
the papal visit was agreed last November at a historic first meeting between the pontiff and President Fidel Castro at the Vatican that underlined a marked improvement over the past year in church-state relations in Cuba . 
Cuban bishops have called for a spirit of reconciliation among Cubans as they prepare for the visit , and Ortega told Saturday &apos;s mass that the pope &apos;s presence would be a &quot; call for us to produce the best from inside ourselves . 
law said that he viewed the Cuban church as very vibrant , adding he had been given tremendous hope by seeing so many young faithful at the mass . 
the mass at the church of Jesus of Miramar , in a residential district of Havana , was held as part of a youth day organised by the church to celebrate Easter and start preparing for the papal visit .
