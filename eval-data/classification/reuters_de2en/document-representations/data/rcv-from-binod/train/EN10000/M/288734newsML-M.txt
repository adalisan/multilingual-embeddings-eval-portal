soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade settled lower Monday after a wave of late long liquidation erased earlier gains , traders said . 
&quot; The people who are long the market just panicked , &quot; said one floor trader . 
Rand Financial , Cargill and L.B. 
Stern were said to be the late sellers . 
each house sold an estimated one million bushels March near the close , pit sources said . 
prices had been firm for most of the session , mostly on ideas that hot weather in Brazil was drying out the soybean crop there , traders said . 
some rainfall was reported in Brazil Monday , but one U.S. meteorologist forecast warmer , drier weather over southern portions of the major soybean belt . 
&quot; More rain will be needed in the coming weeks to prevent significant crop stress from developing , &quot; wrote weather Services Corp in its latest forecast for Brazil . 
however , one trader said he doubted the crop was in jeopardy because his Brazilian clients were sellers all day . 
CBOT soybeans ended down 5-1 / 2 to three cents per bushel with January down 2-1 / 4 at $ 6.94 and March down 4-1 / 4 at $ 6.94-1 / 2 . 
the market ignored relatively sparse USDA export inspections of 18.2 million bushels . 
the data , released Monday during the CBOT session , fell well below trade expectations for 22 million to 27 million bushels , floor sources noted . 
on the day , Refco bought three million bushels March and 800,000 January , Merrill Lynch bought one million March and one million January , traders said . 
soybean volume was estimated at 50,000 contracts , above the 42,908 contracts traded on Friday , according to CBOT data .
