the two major East Asian grain buyers are likely to stay largely out of the market this week due to the Golden Week holiday in Japan and slow domestic consumption in South Korea , traders said on Monday . 
Japan has already bought some 70 percent of its U.S. corn requirements for July-September shipment , dealers said . 
corn premiums were quoted in Japan at nearly 93 U.S. cents a bushel over the CBOT May contract , almost unchanged from last week &apos;s levels . 
&quot; Local buyers will hesitate to buy at least until the end of this week . 
there &apos;s no strong reason to accelrate buying at this stage , &quot; a corn trader at a major trade house in Tokyo said . 
Japan &apos;s buying of U.S. corn during the April-June period was much smaller compared with the same period of last year . 
&quot; Possible supply shortages motivated us to buy more last year . 
but we have less concern about corn supply this year , &quot; another trader said . 
&quot; slow corn buying is likely to ( persist ) for the July-September period , &quot; the corn trader added . 
in South Korea , slow consumption has compounded rising inventory problems , dealers said . 
&quot; Domestic feed demand has not been at the pace we had expected , &quot; a trader with a feed mill in South Korea said . 
domestic feed consumption is seen falling this year due to a slowdown in domestic pork and beef consumption caused by South Korea &apos;s sluggish economy , traders said . 
the decision to allow pork imports from July may also depress feed consumption in the local pork industry , they added . 
South Korean mills are mulling buying Canadian feed wheat , but any deal may take time . 
&quot; However , the purchase will take some time to be matched as Canadian feed wheat prices are currently hovering at $ 155 a tonne C &amp; F. 
feed millers would need about two 50,000-tonne cargoes for arrival from August onwards . 
Cheiljedang Corp and Dongah flour Mills Co Ltd may also invite tenders this week for 21,500 tonnes of U.S. wheat for June 5-July 5 shipment to the port of Inchon , traders said . 
an official with Pan Ocean Shipping Co Ltd said freight rates from the U.S. Pacific Northwest fell to $ 12 a tonne from $ 13- $ 14 tonne last week , partly because of soft demand for Panamax-sized ships for nearby shipment . 
rates from the U.S. Gulf for Panamax-sized nearby shipments were seen falling to $ 22 a tonne from $ 23- $ 24 a tonne last week .
