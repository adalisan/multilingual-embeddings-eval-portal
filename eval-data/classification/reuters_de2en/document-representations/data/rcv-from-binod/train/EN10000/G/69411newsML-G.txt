a wave of new independent voters was expected to make the swing decision on whether North Carolina &apos;s next senator will be Republican incumbent Jesse Helms or Democratic challenger Harvey Gantt . 
the candidates , however , are not new , as their bid for the Senate is a rematch of the heated 1990 contest Helms won after a racially charged television ad . 
Gantt is black . 
but this time , according to political analysts , Helms , 74 , the conservative , and Gantt , 53 , the more liberal candidate , were tempering their messages in hopes of winning the unaffiliated voters . 
&quot; They truly are up for grabs . 
they are more reform minded and looking for more policy discussion , &quot; Katy Harriger , a wake Forest University associate professor who specialises in national elections , said of the independent voters . 
&quot; The left and right are going to the middle to portray themselves as pragmatic ( and ) at the same time caring , &quot; added Bob Billinger , professor of history and government at Wingate University in Wingate , North Carolina . 
he said unaffiliated voters did not like the tax-and-spend-liberals portrayal by conservatives who said they were going to slash government after the 1994 election . 
&quot; Americans didn &apos;t want want government slashed and on the other hand didn &apos;t want tax-and-spend , &quot; he said . 
&quot; They wanted caring but sensible politicians who spend money wisely . 
there are 686,598 new registered voters in the state since the last Helms-Gantt race , and the fastest-growing number of them are unaffiliated with any party , officials said . 
the North Carolina Board of Elections said 431,920 North Carolinians have registered as unaffiliated , or independent , over the past six years . 
Harriger said most voters who call themselves independents lean more one way than the other and that the number of truly independent voters is a much smaller percentage . 
they also tend to be highly educated , earn high incomes , and have a great dislike for negative campaigns , she added . 
both the Helms and Gantt campaigns have run fairly positive television advertisements this election season . 
&quot; Independent voters will have the least tolerance for the negative attacks on the other side , and both candidates are spending a lot of time to build a positive image of themselves , &quot; Harriger said . 
to counter the &quot; too liberal &quot; tag that Helms has started to use in his ads , the ads run by Gantt , an architect who twice served as mayor of Charlotte from 1983-1987 , describe him as a traditionalist emphasising values and discipline . 
but Dalit Toledano , communications director for the Gantt campaign , said the candidate was concentrating on such proposals as eliminating parole for violent criminals , tax deductions for working families and alternative schools for kids who get in trouble rather than labels or name tags . 
early Helms ads show the senator with his granddaughters who tell what a good guy he is while others have focused on policy as compared to the traditional hot-button issues of pornography and gays that he has opposed strongly in the past . 
in their last bout , Helms won by a 53-47 percent margin after running a commercial that charged Gantt favoured quotas that cost white workers their jobs .
