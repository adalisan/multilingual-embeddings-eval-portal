Gary Kirsten hit his seventh one-day century as South Africa crushed Australia by seven wickets for their second win in a triangular series on Saturday . 
South Africa won convincingly , scoring 220 runs off 46.1 overs after restricting Australia , who won the toss , to 219 for seven wickets in their 50 overs on a batting wicket with a fast outfield . 
Kirsten had also been the match-winner on Thursday with an aggressive innings of 84 which helped the South Africans to a 47-run win over hosts India in Hyderabad in the opening match of the Titan Cup series . 
Kirsten hit an unbeaten 105 off 139 balls on Saturday to clinch victory for South Africa , who had earlier performed brilliantly in the field , with Jonty Rhodes outstanding . 
some 20,000 people in the Nehru Stadium cheered as Kirsten and Andrew Hudson put on 118 for the first wicket before Hudson ( 53 off 74 balls ) miscued paceman Glenn McGrath to skipper Mark Taylor at extra cover . 
a single over by McGrath had cost 18 runs , including five leg byes and three fours , two of them by Hudson . 
but after McGrath had dismissed Hudson he quickly bowled Darryl Cullinan for a duck with a short delivery . 
skipper Hanse Cronje ( 14 ) edged to wicket-keeper Ian Healy a rising delivery from paceman Jason Gillespie . 
but Rhodes ( 19 not out ) and Kirsten wrapped it all up . 
earlier , left-hander Michael Bevan held out bravely for Australia with a bold 56 off 78 balls after a collapse which followed a good start by openers Mark Waugh ( 50 ) and skipper Mark Taylor ( 39 ) , who put on 85 for the first wicket . 
&quot; I think we are lucky to have Jonty Rhodes and Crookes . 
they are brilliant fielders , &quot; South African coach Bob Woolmer told reporters . 
&quot; We have played a lot against Australia . 
we bowled the right balls . 
Kirsten said : &quot; Andrew Hudson played very well . 
it allowed me to relax . 
Taylor said the South Africans had just played better than his own team . 
&quot; It is just one of those things , &quot; he said .
