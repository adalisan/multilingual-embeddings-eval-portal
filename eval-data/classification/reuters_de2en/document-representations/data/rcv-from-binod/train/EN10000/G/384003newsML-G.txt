Valencia and Barcelona are ready to sign Real Madrid teenager Raul Gonzalez in a deal that could be worth 4.6 billion pesetas ( $ 32.9 million ) , according to a report published by the Spanish sports daily &apos; Marca &apos; on Tuesday . 
according to the article Raul has been approached by Valencia coach Jorge Valdano , the man who discovered him as a 17-year old third-team player , while Barcelona made the offer through a fellow international during a World Cup qualifier . 
both clubs refused to comment on the reports . 
Raul , 19 , had been expected to renegotiate his contract with the Madrid side after his superb performance in last month &apos;s derby win over Atletico . 
under the terms of his current agreement any side hoping to buy the striker would have to pay Real 1.6 billion pesetas ( $ 11.4 million ) , a figure considered to be relatively cheap by many experts in the Spanish game . 
the article said Valencia would pay Raul 500 million pesetas ( $ 3.57 million ) a season for six seasons . 
real chairman Lorenzo Sanz said on Tuesday Real would never pay anybody 500 million pesetas a year , although defender Fernando Hierro is thought to be earning about 300 million pesetas a year .
