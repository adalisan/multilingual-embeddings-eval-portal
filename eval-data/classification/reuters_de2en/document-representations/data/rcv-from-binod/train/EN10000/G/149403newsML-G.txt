Swiss cyclist Tony Rominger will join the new Cofidis team next year for his last season on the professional circuit , the French stable said in a statement on Tuesday . 
Rominger , 35 , will leave Mapei to become the leader of Cofidis , whose sporting director is Frenchman Cyrille Guimard . 
Cofidis had already reached an agreement with American Lance Armstrong , who revealed earlier this month that he had testicular and abdominal cancer . 
the French team said they would still welcome Armstrong , currently undergoing treatment , if he were fit enough to join them but added they had to find somebody to replace him . 
&quot; Cyrille Guimard found a perfect leader in Rominger , who was looking forward to a new challenge before ending his career at the end of 1997 , &quot; Cofidis said in a statement . 
former world hour record Rominger won the Tour of Spain three times in a row from 1991 and 1993 and the Giro in 1995 . 
he proved this year that he still had plenty to offer by taking third place in both the Vuelta and the timed trial event of the world championships .
