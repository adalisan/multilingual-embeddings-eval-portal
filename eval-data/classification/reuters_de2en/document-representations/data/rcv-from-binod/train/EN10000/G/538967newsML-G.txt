Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda on Thursday praised Tokyo &apos;s ambassador in Lima , former hostage Morihisa Aoki , saying he played a key role in bringing the crisis at his residence to a swift end . 
&quot; You did a great job , the Japanese people are truly relieved , &quot; Ikeda told Aoki , according to a Japanese Foreign Ministry media briefing on a meeting between the two men . 
&quot; The crisis came to an early end because you did not lose your temper , &quot; the ministry quoted Ikeda as telling Aoki , who was the ill-fated host of a cocktail party stormed Dec . 17 by Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) rebels . 
following Tuesday &apos;s rescue of all but one of the 72 hostages by elite Peruvian commandos Ikeda arrived in Lima early on Thursday accompanied by a 100-strong delegation including 27 police officers , six members of a medical team and 10 relatives of the freed Japanese hostages . 
Aoki , who suffered injuries to his legs and hips as he crawled across the roof of his home during the gun battle in the explosive raid , said the worst moments were the violent beginning and end to the 126-day crisis . 
&quot; We went through the toughest experience at the beginning of the siege and in the last 30 minutes of the crisis , &quot; Aoki said . 
&quot; When Peruvian troops stormed my residence , the room we were staying in caught fire . 
it was then that we broke the windows , jumped out and got injured . 
while the 14 MRTA rebels , one hostage and two commandos died in the raid , all 24 Japanese captives , including diplomats and top businessmen , survived .
