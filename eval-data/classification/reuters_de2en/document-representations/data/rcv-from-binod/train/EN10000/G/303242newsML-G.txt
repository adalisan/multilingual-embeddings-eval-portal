Sleuths at Paris police headquarters have solved a particularly brutal killing and an attempted murder thanks to spittle found near the body of one victim , police said on Monday . 
Mamadou Traore , 23 , was placed under judicial investigation for murder after confessing to beating to death a 41-year-old woman in her home in August and nearly killing Laurence Eymieux , 35 , a senior civil servant , in an underground parking lot two months later , police said . 
the only clue to the death of the older woman , who was also raped , was spittle found near the corpse . 
her body was so badly battered that police believed she was killed with a baseball bat or some other heavy instrument . 
two months later , Eymieux , top aide to Territorial Planning Minister Jean-Claude Gaudin , was left for dead after suffering a similar beating when she parked her car on return home from work . 
she emerged from a coma after several weeks and gave a description of her assailant which led to the arrest of Traore , a Frenchman of Senegalese origin . 
noting similarities with the other case , police tested Traore &apos;s saliva which matched that found at the scene of the first crime . 
police said he confessed to both attacks and they were checking his possible involvement in other similar crimes .
