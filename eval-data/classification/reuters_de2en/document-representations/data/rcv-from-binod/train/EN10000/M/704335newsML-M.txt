crude tanker chartering slowed on Thursday as United States brokers left their desks ahead of the Independence Day holiday weekend . 
the only visible moves were in the Caribbean , where rates for afarmaxes slipped , and in the Middle East where they firmed up for 80,000 tonne ships headed east . 
&quot; Basically , with the holiday in the United States , we &apos;ve been left to our own devices , &quot; said a London broker . 
&quot; It &apos;s going to be pretty quiet until Monday . 
Mideast rates for eastbound afarmaxes were stronger , averaging around W82.5. 
Exxon led the way higher when it fixed an 80,000 tonne ship east at W100 . 
&quot; The Exxon deal was a bit of a blip , but in general the market is picking up , &quot; said a broker . 
&quot; It has been fairly low lately , and given that a lot of fixtures were made in the last two weeks , we may see it go higher . 
Mideast rates for VLCCs were mostly steady , with fixtures seen at W73 to Japan and around W55 for voyages to Singapore . 
westwards , rates were assessed at W52 . 
enquires were made on Wednesday for a VLCC cargo out of Iraq for the end of July , but the deal failed as oil exports from Iraq are still on hold pending United Nations approval of an aid distribution plan . 
Iraq &apos;s U.N. coordinator Staffan de Mistura said on Thursday the plan was now complete and needed only fine tuning before being submitted to the U.N. 
&quot; They were jumping the gun a bit , &quot; said one broker of the speculative fixture . 
&quot; They obviously decided to test the water . 
elsewhere , Carib fixtures , which had been buoyed up by plentiful tonnage , slipped back as demand fell off . 
rates for 70,000 tonne tankers to the U.S. coast fell to an average of W155 , with one deal reported at W137.5. 
&quot; We &apos;re seeing rates on afarmaxes coming down and I think they &apos;ll go even lower . 
&quot; said a broker in Venezuela . 
&quot; There aren &apos;t any cargoes around today - with the holiday in the U.S. tomorrow , I think everyone got their business done yesterday . 
we could be collapsed until Monday . 
charters heading for the United States Gulf from West Africa were also quiet , with rates drifting around Wednesday &apos;s levels . 
cross Med and North Sea rates were also steady .
