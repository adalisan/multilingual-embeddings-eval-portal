most Singapore companies are not likely to venture into Europe in a big way in the next five to eight years and would continue to focus on Asia , Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said . 
&quot; It &apos;s unlikely , given the resources in manpower that we have , that we &apos;ll be going far away to Europe because our expertise is here , &quot; he said in an interview with Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad , the transcript of which was released on Wednesday . 
Goh , accompanied by a business delegation , visits Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg from Wednesday to October 16 . 
Goh said the concentration of Singapore companies is now in Asia where there is very robust growth in China while vigorous growth is expected in Vietnam , Indonesia , and Thailand . 
&quot; But some Singapore companies have more capital now and with the additional capital , we see that quite a few are now moving to Europe . 
but these are mainly property development companies . 
&quot; They would either invest in a hotel or in office space or they would acquire some companies as majority shareholder or some shares as minority shareholder . 
that is coming but I don &apos;t see a big wave of this happening over the next five to eight years . 
Goh said he would like Singapore firms to enter into some partnerships in Research and Development with Dutch companies and learn about environmental technology from them . 
Goh also said , with the World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference coming up in December , he wants to make sure that Singapore and the Netherlands work together at the meeting . 
&quot; I believe our position will be common at this coming Conference . 
and , of course , I want to see whether we can do more trade with one another , invest more in Singapore and hopefully maybe some investments in Netherlands by Singapore investors .
