U.S. June Standard and Poor &apos;s 500 futures collapsed in a frenzy of panic selling and closed near a two-month low . 
rate hike fears and technical weakness , exacerbated by thin holiday markets , shoved stocks deep into negative territory . 
June tumbled the initial 15.00-point lower trading limit in the afternoon , locking limit down and halting trade for two minutes . 
June crumbled even more when trade reopened . 
&quot; It &apos;s a holiday market , there &apos;s no one here and they &apos;re hitting them , &quot; one S &amp; P 500 futures trader said in the last half-hour of trade . 
&quot; It &apos;s as simple as that . 
floor sources said bearish technicals ruled the market , with wide spots of illiquidity shoving June S &amp; Ps swiftly lower . 
huge sell stops were noted below former support at 788.00 and 782.55 , traders said . 
&quot; It &apos;s really technical , &quot; the trader said . 
traders said sharply lower Treasury bond prices got the bearish ball rolling . 
debt futures closed early around noon today , after sliding more than a full point on strong U.S. data this morning . 
the June T-bond crumbled to a six-month low in its shortened session . 
June S &amp; Ps floated quietly in lower territory after T-bonds closed , reaching an afternoon high of 791.80 before the panic selloff to a session low of 768.50 . 
&quot; It was so sloppy , &quot; one broker said . 
&quot; It was awful . 
June shaved some of its losses on short-covering before the close , but trade was erratic , traders said . 
traders said Monday &apos;s session could see month-end and quarter-end window dressing , and noted it was the final day of the Japanese fiscal year . 
&quot; I would expect us to bounce ( on Monday ) , &quot; one trader said , noting that June S &amp; Ps closed at a narrow premium to cash . 
&quot; They closed it five points too cheap so you think we &apos;d be able to get some buying , &quot; he said . 
the markets are closed on Friday , but a round of U.S. data -- including fourth-quarter U.S. real gross domestic product and February new home sales -- will still be released for players to chew on over the weekend . 
robust February existing home sales , which rose 9.0 percent , triggered the selloff in T-bonds today , with traders edgy about prospects for more strong data . 
at the close , June S &amp; Ps were down 22.70 points at 775.50 , Midcap 400s fell 4.55 pts to 259.40 , Nikkei 225 index futures fell 395.0 to 18,120.0 , Nasdaq 100s lost 16.50 pts to 826.75 and KCBT Value Line futures fell 12.70 to 696.50 .
