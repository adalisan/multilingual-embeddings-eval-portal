the key December JGB contract may challenge its all-time high of 123.61 hit in London late last week , traders said on Monday . 
but the cash bond market will stay slow in catching up with the futures due to profit-taking selling by traders , they said . 
the futures market has already factored in a hefty cash infusion which could be poured into bonds by the government wind-up scheme of failed mortgage companies , traders said . 
approximately 907 billion yen will be disbursed by banks on October 17 to the &quot; Financial Stabilisation Fund &quot; , which was set up by the government &apos;s Deposit Insurance Corp in July . 
traders said the bonds are likely to be the main beneficiary of the 907 billion yen infusion . 
meanwhile , 180 billion yen in cash , which has been parked in CD repurchase agreements , is due to mature on October 18 and will become available for bond investment . 
the 180 billion yen is part of the portfolio of the Housing Loan Administration Corp , the body set up to collect problem loans incurred by the failed mortgage firms . 
it has already started investing the funds it inherited from the firms . 
the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd ( IBJ ) is expected to announce a cut in its long-term prime rate later today . 
the prime rate , the rate at which the banks lend to their most creditworthy customers , has been set at 3.0 percent since September . 
the size of the cut is likely to be around 0.3 percentage point , judging from current market conditions , bond traders said .
