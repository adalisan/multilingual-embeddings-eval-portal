spot power prices for peak demand hours in the western U.S. moved sharply higher in reaction to cold weather , market sources said Monday . 
&quot; The weather is cold and peak loads have exceeded the hydro ( electric ) capacity , &quot; said one trader . 
as a result , there is a big price jump for power generated from the next resource , generally natural gas , he explained . 
&quot; There is a big vacuum between price levels . 
once people stop needing the extra power for those four hours or so in the middle of the day , prices will go back down , &quot; the trader predicted . 
he and others said forecasts for warmer temperatures later in the week will bring prices back down within a day or two . 
Bonneville Power Administration ( BPA ) sold out of the 250 megawatts offered during peak hours on Tuesday at $ 46.00 per megawatt hour ( MWh ) for California-Oregon border ( COB ) and $ 45.00 for Northwest deliveries , the agency said .
