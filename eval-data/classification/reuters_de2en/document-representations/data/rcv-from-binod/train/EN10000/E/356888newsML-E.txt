the International Monetary Fund has completed its latest review of the Russian economy and its board will meet on Friday to work out whether to recommend handing over extra cash , an IMF Moscow official said on Wednesday . 
IMF Moscow representative Tom Wolf said the review was positive , but he could not say how much the IMF would hand over this month . 
the fund delayed paying two tranches of its $ 10 billion three-year loan to Russia in the final quarter of last year and many Russian officials expect one of these delayed payments , as well as the tranche for January , to be handed over this month . 
the IMF , anxious to ensure that Russian economic reforms remain on track , is looking at Russia &apos;s economy each month before deciding whether to release extra cash . 
Wolf said the experts would carry out their monthly monitoring as well as looking at Russia &apos;s economic plans for 1997 .
