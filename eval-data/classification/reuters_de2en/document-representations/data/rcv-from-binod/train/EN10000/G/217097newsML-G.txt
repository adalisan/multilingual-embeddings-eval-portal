Cuban exile Pipin Ferreras set a world record on Tuesday by plunging 438 feet , 11 inches ( 133.5 metres ) in the sea while holding his breath ( corrects record from 436 feet ( 133 metres ) ) . 
blasting to the surface with a balloon after descending on a cable with weights , Ferreras hugged members of his team in jubilation after setting the 20th world record of his nine-year career . 
the successful attempt followed his failed attempt on Sunday , when choppy seas and a crush of spectators in a flotilla of small boats hampered his effort . 
but on Tuesday Ferreras broke the old record of 429 feet ( 130 metres ) set by Humberto Pellizare of Italy in June . 
Ferreras wore a wetsuit and nose plugs but no mask or goggles . 
Ferreras , 34 , was underwater for two minutes , 35 seconds in the bay off this Pacific resort , which is famous for marlin fishing . 
he said an unexpectedly slow descent caused him to fall short of his goal of 445 feet , six inches ( 135 metres ) . 
at his record breaking level , Ferreras felt the pressure of 14.3 atmospheres , with his internal organs squeezed up into his chest cavity , reducing his lung capacity to one-tenth its normal size . 
on land , humans feel the pressure of one atmosphere . 
because of his slow descent , he said that at a depth of about 300 feet ( 90 metres ) , &quot; I lost my concentration . 
Free-diving has been an international competition since 1949 , started by divers who once planted mines on Nazi submarines in the Second World War . 
funded by corporate sponsors , it has been dominated by the French and Italians . 
Ferreras , who defected from Communist-ruled Cuba in 1993 despite his privileged status as one of the world &apos;s top free-divers , said he stumbled onto the sport while eking out a living as a spear fisherman along Havana &apos;s boardwalk . 
it was there that Russian and Cuban scientists sought him out as part of study on the effects of gravity on MiG jet fighter pilots by comparing them to the bodily effects of atmospheres . 
Ferreras was famed for diving the deepest without oxygen tanks , always coming back with the biggest fish . 
on Sunday Ferreras stopped at 396 feet ( 120 metres ) because he was about to hit a rock . 
event promoters blamed the mishap on curiosity-seekers who crowded around the mother ship and interfered with depth finders , the sophisticated instruments that map the ocean floor . 
this time Ferreras &apos;s ship sailed into the bay without fanfare and kept a handful of boats at a safe distance by posting buoys around a wide perimeter . 
the wind was calm . 
Ferreras said he would like to exend his record to 495 feet ( 150 metres ) and then retire from free-diving to take up underwater photography .
