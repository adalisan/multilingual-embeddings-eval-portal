Republican Sen. Frank Murkowski might reach an agreement with the White House soon to clear the way for a confirmation vote on Energy Secretary nominee Federico Pena , a Senate Energy Committee aide said on Monday . 
Committee chairman Murkowski of Alaska has twice postponed a vote on Pena to force the White House to acknowledge lawmakers &apos; concerns about the build-up of radioactive waste at nuclear power plants . 
in a statement issued later Monday , Murkowski said he would hold a news conference Tuesday on Pena and on &quot; the necessity for safer storage of high-level radioactive waste . 
the committee aide said the White House was beginning to respond , in contrast to last year , when letters from Murkowski asking for a plan to take over the spent fuel , as required under law , received unhelpful replies or no replies at all . 
&quot; We &apos;re now receiving responses , &quot; he said at a briefing . 
he said a meeting between Murkowski and White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles last week had helped . 
under a 1982 law , the government was supposed to start removing nuclear waste from utilities in January next year , but the Energy Department has nowhere to put it . 
President Clinton has threatened to veto any legislation that would force the government to build a temporary storage facility for the waste next to the Nevada site that is being investigated as a permanent dump . 
the Energy Department has said a permanent site will only be ready in 2010 at the earliest . 
Democrats on the Energy Committee last week urged Murkowski to stop holding up the nomination .
