Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel on Wednesday welcomed a new long-term official target of &quot; Western &quot; -level inflation , which he defined as about three percent a year . 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday rejected a central bank demand for a specific multi-year inflation goal . 
but Frenkel applauded the decision to achieve &quot; Western &quot; levels of inflation by the year 2001 . 
&quot; For the first time the prime minister has decided he wants to see the inflation in Israel by the end of the decade or start of the coming decade at a &apos; Western &apos; level , which today is about three percent , &quot; Frenkel said in an interivew with Israel Radio . 
&quot; I see yesterday &apos;s decision as most important because here it has been determined for the first time that the government is adopting a long-term strategy to lower inflation in Israel . 
Netanyahu &apos;s government has set a 1997 inflation target of seven to 10 percent and promised to set a 1998 goal in the first half of next year , Treasury and central bank sources said . 
the government had set an eight to 10 percent inflation target for 1996 , but inflation is expected to exceed 10 percent . 
&quot; The decision regarding the inflation target for the coming year , which will be seven to 10 percent , is obviously an acceptable decision and it &apos;s important because it reflects progress in comparison with what there was this year , &quot; Frenkel said . 
&quot; It also reflects some sort of recognition that the struggle until now is succeeding . 
asked why , given the new targets and government promises of budget cuts , Frenkel was still resisting lowering interest rates , the Bank of Israel governor said : &quot; Policy is not conducted based on declarations but achievements . 
Frenkel also told the radio : &quot; It &apos;s very important that there be a cut not only in the deficit of the government but in the expenditures of the government . 
&quot; We cannot raise taxes ... the money must be left in the hands of the public and the economic decisions in the hands of the public , &quot; he added .
