commodity prices generally remain on the defensive , after energy prices tumbled in the first quarter 1997 , along with precious metals , but the agricultural sector looks to hold some promise in the second quarter , U.S. analysts said . 
&quot; The first quarter 1997 saw commodities trade in a mixed to weaker pattern with little inflationary implication , but the outlook for the second quarter is somewhat more constructive , &quot; Merrill Lynch director of commodity research , Bill O &apos;Neill , said . 
&quot; precious metals have been generally reflecting the tone of commodity markets , particularly gold which lost about $ 23.00 in the first quarter as growth and inflationary pressures remained tame , &quot; he said . 
nearby active COMEX gold futures prices last week week fell to $ 339.50 an ounce , testing the 46 month lows seen in January . 
the energy-dominated Goldman Sach &apos;s commodity Index ( GSCI ) weakened in the first quarter as crude oil prices lost significant ground . 
nearby NYMEX crude oil futures fell to 12 month lows at $ 18.96 a barrel mid-April , from six year highs at $ 26.80 in late December . 
the GSCI started the year with a 231.82 high on January 6 before sliding to 185.63 on April 4 . 
&quot; After generating 33.92 percent returns in 1996 , compared with 20.33 percent in 1995 , the GSCI now stands down 8.4 percent for the year , &quot; Goldman Sach &apos;s commodities research director , Steve Strongin , said . 
on a similar basis S &amp; P500 index futures returns are up 2.42 percent year-to-date . 
&quot; Almost all of this loss ( in the GSCI returns index ) has been in the significantly weaker-than-expected energy market , where the spring seasonal price drop occurred with added vigor in February , when winter made an early and rapid departure . 
&quot; We expect the energy market to remain vulnerable until the market focus shifts from the availability of physical crude oil to the shortage of gasoline . 
&quot; In contrast the non-energy components of the GSCI ( returns index ) are up 8.5 percent year-to-date , &quot; Strongin said . 
the more agriculturally-oriented CRB index showed no real trend in the first quarter , climbing from a low of 238.12 on December 31 to a high of 248.01 on March 11 . 
&quot; upside potential is seen for some agricultural commodities , with coffee at the forefront and our long standing view that prices will reach $ 2.25 or higher remains on target , &quot; O &apos;Neill said . 
CSCE May coffee saw a new contract high at $ 2.24 a pound Monday . 
&quot; In the grain and oilseed complex an upside bias is also favored for the second quarter , but very high volatility should be the norm as weather may play a key role , &quot; O &apos;Neill said . 
nearby CBOT May soybeans hit their highest levels since September 1988 early this month at $ 8.88-1 / 2 a bushel , before slipping back to $ 8.44 Monday . 
&quot; Trade estimates of the 1997 South American soybean harvest are eroding in response to dryness during March and April throughout both Argentina and Brazil , &quot; Smith Barney analyst Dale Gustafson said . 
&quot; We also expect the 1997 U.S. plantings will fall short of the USDA ( U.S. 
agricultural Department ) March 1 indication of 68.8 million acres by about two million acres , &quot; he said . 
looking out over the rest of the year , U.S. economic growth was seen supporting commodity demand , but analysts expressed some concern about the still sluggish economic growth in Europe and Asia . 
&quot; The underlying fundamentals that drove strong commodity returns in 1995 and 1996 are still in place , &quot; Strongin said . 
&quot; inventory levels in energy and agriculture remain near historic lows and we continue to experience high levels of global demand , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But the recent pattern of downward revision in Asian growth forecasts is worrisome , as non-Japan Asia remains the single largest source of commodity demand growth . 
&quot; In fact the bulk of our downward revision in our GSCI return forecast from 14 percent to 12 percent ( for the year ) is due to lower forecasts of non-Japan Asian growth .
