a bounce in the London stock market triggered mixed deals in the FTSE 100 index options on Wednesday as traders were unconvinced that the market could make a sustained recovery , dealers said . 
one of the larger deals was a strip established by buying 1,000 December 3300 puts at 3p as well as 1,000 December 3400 puts at 5p in the hope the market will fall away in the coming months . 
a further 1,500 lots were traded in the same series with a number of counterparties . 
the other main deals concerned trading calendar spreads in the European style FTSE options . 
one such deal was from a trader buying 1,000 December 3925 puts at 77p and selling 1,000 March 3925 puts at 120p making a net credit of 43p . 
increased volatility will help this strategy to make maximum profit by December expiry because the spread or difference between the option premiums will then reduce from its current 43p level and the position can be closed at a profit . 
if the short puts are held after December expiry , the FTSE needs to then go above 3925 by March expiry in order to add to profits . 
other traders dealing in 500 lots had an opposite view of the market and bought calendar spreads in the same option series . 
at the close of business on the stock market the FTSE index was up 25.2 at 3935.7 . 
over in stock options , there was a buyer of 500 October 650 calls at 6-1 / 2p in British Petroleum . 
the underlying shares closed up 2p at 637-1 / 2p .
