the United Nations has approved a recent sale of 100,000 tonnes of French wheat to Iraq under a U.N.-monitored oil-for-food pact , a French government source said on Monday . 
the approval , given by U.N. sanctions inspectors on Friday , brings to 300,000 tonnes the volume of wheat which has been sold to Iraq and subsequently cleared by the U.N. , the source said . 
international grain traders have sold a total of 600,000 tonnes of French wheat to Iraq since Baghdad began pumping oil to raise money for humanitarian supplies in December . 
the French source said Paris had also asked the U.N. to vet the remaining 300,000 tonnes of wheat sales . 
under a U.N. resolution easing the sanctions imposed for Iraq &apos;s 1990 invasion of Kuwait , Baghdad is allowed to sell oil worth up to $ 2 billion over six months to buy food and medicine . 
each contract must be approved by the U.N. before the supplies can be delivered . 
after war reparations and other costs , about half the money raised will be available for food and medicine , with the bulk of Iraq &apos;s purchases expected to be in the form of wheat .
