the dollar lost its struggle to keep above 1.51 marks , dragged down by a creeping feeling that no U.S. interest rate rise is on the cards near-term , dealers said . 
the dollar fell below 1.24 Swiss francs and 1.51 marks in late trade but key support levels remained untouched . 
dollar / yen , still slave to the mark / yen cross , also fell to session lows in line with general dollar sales . 
&quot; The dollar was looking top-heavy this morning and as a few bids were pulled in late trade it extended the downside , &quot; said a senior trader at a German bank in London . 
at 1515 GMT the dollar traded at 1.5082 / 86 marks and 110.16 / 21 in late European trading on Friday . 
against the Swiss franc , it was at 1.2373 / 83 versus 1.2398 / 2408 . 
U.S. rate hike expectations were tempered late last week by weaker-than-expected U.S. producer and consumer price figures and retail sales data below market forecasts . 
&quot; Interest rate support is waning , after last week &apos;s economic data strengthened the view that the economy is slowing in the second half of the year , while inflation pressures remain unexpectedly subdued , &quot; said Klaus Baader , senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
Booksquaring in late trade added downside impetus after a quiet day , but dealers said the dollar still looked protected . 
key support cuts in at 1.5060 marks , a level representing a 50 percent retracement of the dollar &apos;s decline from its 1996 high just below 1.55 marks to a low of 1.4635 in late July . 
analysts said U.S. industrial production and capacity utilisation data , due for release on Tuesday , might help the dollar to rise again if they rekindle rate rise expectations . 
however , industrial production is expected to show only moderate strength and capacity utilisation is expected to be below the critical 85 percent level . 
analysts consider an operating rate of 85 percent or above as a sign that inflation will accelerate in coming months . 
the mark extended its weakness on its European crosses . 
mark / Paris leading the way down to 3.4040 per mark in late trade , while the German unit fell close to 82 centimes against the Swiss franc . 
the market is awaiting the Franco-German economic summit on Tuesday and the French budget on Wednesday for further clues to those countries &apos; efforts to meet the targets for European economic and monetary union .
