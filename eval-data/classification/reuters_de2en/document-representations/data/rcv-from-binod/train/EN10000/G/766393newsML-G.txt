when an Israeli man spoke of peace at the scene of a double suicide bombing in Jerusalem on Wednesday , hordes of ultra-orthodox Jews screamed at him to leave . 
&quot; We must continue the process or the enemies of peace will win , &quot; said Mike Masud , motioning behind him to the closed-off marketplace where two suicide bombers killed 12 people just hours before . 
&quot; Those who love peace will fight for it , &quot; he said as a crowd gathered . 
&quot; Peace is a nightmare , &quot; an ultra-orthodox man shouted at him , waving his arms . 
Masud smiled . 
&quot; If you don &apos;t believe in it , it won &apos;t work , &quot; he said . 
Masud raised his arms and backed away . 
we can do that . 
we must live together . 
if peace won &apos;t work , we can always go for war . 
but we must try for peace first , &quot; he said . 
peace was not on the agenda for most of the ultra-orthodox Jews who ventured to the market to gawk . 
some pushed strollers with toddlers trailing behind . 
rubber gloves and plastic cups littered the gutters , crushed by hundreds of feet . 
&quot; We should kill them all , &quot; said one man , referring to Arabs . 
&quot; We need strong security . 
we need to restrict the Arabs and punish them severely , close all the borders , &quot; said Chaim Weiss , an ultra-orthodox American Jew in Israel to study Jewish law . 
&quot; God must be mad , so many people die , innocent people , &quot; he said . 
even though Palestinian President Yasser Arafat condemned the bombing , few Jews at the market said they could ever trust Arabs . 
&quot; I think the poor , average Palestinian is being duped by Arafat like everyone else , &quot; said Rachel Rosenberg , 41 , who immigrated to Israel from the United States seven years ago . 
&quot; ( But ) Arabs are not to be trusted . 
they &apos;ve got the seeds of deception , &quot; she said . 
&quot; The Arabs , the young generation , are all being brought up to do suicide bombs , &quot; said a New Jersey man living in Israel . 
&quot; ( For an Arab ) it is a good deed to kill a Jew , it &apos;s a mitzvah ( good deed ) . 
you cannot talk to them , &quot; said Rabbi Avraham album , 70 . 
despite all Masud &apos;s arguing , he couldn &apos;t change anyone &apos;s mind and eventually walked away from the crowd shaking his head . 
&quot; Every time something like this happens , extremists will say , &apos; Look , we &apos;re trying peace and look what we get . 
&apos; Light must come to Israel , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s very important to achieve justice , but most people don &apos;t believe in peace .
