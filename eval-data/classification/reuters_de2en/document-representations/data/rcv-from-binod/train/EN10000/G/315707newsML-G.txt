American Steve Fossett was denied permission on Friday to fly over Libya , his expedition said , a decision that could end his bid to be the first to circle the earth nonstop in a balloon . 
&quot; We are trying to decide what to do right now , &quot; an expedition spokeswoman said at Fossett &apos;s Chicago control centre . 
the expedition had said earlier that the 52-year-old adventurer , now over Algeria , would probably have to abort the voyage if Libya would not let him cross . 
the news came as Fossett broke his own record for balloon travel when he reached 5,435 miles ( 8,747 km ) -- a record he had set on a passage from South Korea to Canada . 
just before word came from Libya , project manager Bo Kemper had expressed renewed hope that the country would give safe passage to Fossett &apos;s British-registered balloon . 
his team had mounted an international effort to put pressure on the Libyan government , ever since Fossett lifted off from St. Louis on Monday night . 
the dangers of entering foreign airspace were illustrated by two American balloonists who died in 1995 . 
they were shot down by Belarus military who claimed they had no clearance to enter its air space . 
organisers said they had been cleared .
