Iraq has introduced a law allowing all Arab nationals -- except Palestinians -- to acquire Iraqi nationality , national newspapers reported on Monday . 
&quot; Any Arab except the Palestinian can submit a request to the Interior Ministry to grant him / her the Iraqi nationality , &quot; the government newspaper al-Jumhouriya quoted a Revolutionary Command Council decree signed by President Saddam Hussein as saying . 
Iraq has banned Palestinians from holding Iraqi nationality long time ago in the hope that they would one day return back to a Palestinian state . 
the decree set few conditions for having Iraqi nationality including the applicant should be above the age 18 , living in an Arab country and his or her parents should be Arabs . 
it added that the interior minister should grant nationality to Arabs who applied for it during a period of three months . 
it did not say whether they should be living in Iraq or not when they apply for the nationality .
