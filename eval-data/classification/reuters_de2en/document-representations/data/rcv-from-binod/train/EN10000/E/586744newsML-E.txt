the Consumer Price Index is the most reliable measure of U.S. inflation though its ability to signal turning points in price trends remains in question , a Federal Reserve Bank of New York vice president said . 
&quot; There is a certain bias in the CPI , but no other index has proven to be better , &quot; New York Fed vice president Charles Steindel told Reuters . 
Steindel pointed out the CPI &apos;s reliability as an inflation gauge is a separate issue from its ability to predict turning points in trends . 
&quot; How accurate is the CPI in telling turning points in inflation ? 
does this index really detect it ? 
&quot; Steindel said . 
Steindel , who spoke to Reuters before the April CPI was reported up 0.1 percent and the core CPI up 0.3 percent , noted &quot; the recent inflation numbers obviously are not very different from what they were one or two years ago . 
&quot; It does not necessarily mean this could not change , &quot; Steindel pointed out . 
the New York Fed senior economist acknowledged some critics of the CPI -- that is believed to overstate inflation by about a percentage point -- have argued other indices may give more accurate readings of inflation . 
&quot; The CPI has statistical problems , &quot; Steindel said of the suspected substitution and quality biases in the inflation index . 
&quot; How much of the price change of a product is actually an improvement in quality ? 
&quot; Although the CPI does not measure true inflation , we currently have no thorough viable alternatives to an easy-to-use and fairly reliable guide to inflation movements , &quot; said Steindel who recently authored a resarch paper on the CPI and other U.S. inflation measures . 
in the paper , Steindel compared the CPI to the price index in the Gross Domestic Product and to the personal consumption expenditures ( PCE ) index . 
Steindel pointed out the GDP price index takes into account one-time items , such as the price of a factory , that clearly do not enter in the cost of living . 
&quot; Another drawback of the GDP index is that it measures the prices of goods and services produced in the United States as opposed to the CPI which measures the prices of goods and services purchased by Americains , &quot; the economist said . 
the PCE index suffers from problems that are not unlike those afflicting the CPI because its initial estimates are calculated according to similar rules and followed by several revisions . 
&quot; Although the PCE index may ultimately show a clear superiority to the CPI , thus far , it has not done so , &quot; added Steindel who concluded &quot; the CPI index does offer an appropriate starting point from which to make adjustments . 
one possible adjustment would be to produce a mean CPI , or core measure of inflation excluding items that depart too much from the mean . 
economist Stephen Cecchetti , who is to become New York Fed Director of Research this summer , is working on a refined measure of core inflation based on the Cleveland Fed &apos;s median CPI .
