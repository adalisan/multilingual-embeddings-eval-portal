about 3,000 Kenyan students marched through Nairobi on Wednesday in a fourth day of protests and blamed police for the death of student leader Solomon Muruli . 
Western embassies , human rights activists and Kenya &apos;s opposition hit out on Wednesday at Muruli &apos;s killing on Sunday but police said they were not treating it as a murder . 
students from Nairobi &apos;s Kenyatta University and the Kenya Polytechnic demonstrated peacefully through the capital &apos;s main commercial district , waving placards calling for justice and peace . 
&quot; You murderers , no more killings , &quot; they chanted at police headquarters . 
&quot; We want to know who killed Muruli and why , &quot; read a placard . 
&quot; Put a stop to police killings , &quot; another said . 
some students banged against buses and other vehicles with their hands but police were under orders not to confront them . 
there were no reports of injuries . 
marchers stopped and chanted outside the Nation Centre , which houses the Nairobi Stock Exchange and the independent Nation Newspapers Group but bourse business continued normally . 
the Law Society of Kenya , Kenya Human Rights Commission and the International Commission of Jurists called for a judicial commission of inquiry into the death of the 23-year-old student . 
his charred body was found early on Sunday in his room at a Nairobi University hostel at Kikuyu , 30 km ( 18 miles ) outside the capital . 
witnesses and a security officer said they heard an explosion shortly before . 
on Monday Kenyan authorities closed down Nairobi and Egerton universities because of violent protests at Muruli &apos;s death . 
the Kenya Times , owned by the ruling party , said on Wednesday police investigating his death had recorded statements from police officers at Kikuyu police station and three members of parliament . 
police sources said Police Commissioner Duncan Wachira told police to refrain from confronting students in case of clashes . 
students said a funeral mass was planned for Muruli at the main Anglican All Saints Cathedral in Nairobi on Thursday . 
police spokesman superintendent Peter Kimanthi said on Tuesday there was no evidence Muruli was killed by an explosion in his room because the body was &quot; charred but not mutilated &quot; . 
Kimanthi said police were investigating allegations Muruli received death threats in the week before his death and his reported abduction and torture for a week in November 1996 . 
Muruli said he was kidnapped by police in November after complaining about conditions at the university , beaten and dumped in a Churchyard . 
police have denied the allegations . 
the British High Commission said on Tuesday : &quot; Those responsible , whatever their position , must be brought to justice . 
&quot; Britain is Kenya &apos;s largest foreign investor and trading partner . 
the Netherlands , current European Union president , said through its embassy in Nairobi it was worried about recent violence against Kenyan students and feared Muruli &apos;s death might generate further violence . 
President Daniel arap Moi sacked Kenya &apos;s police commissioner last December after police shot dead two students at Nairobi &apos;s Kenyatta University and one student at Egerton University . 
the student unrest has come in the run-up to presidential and parliamentary elections due in the next year .
