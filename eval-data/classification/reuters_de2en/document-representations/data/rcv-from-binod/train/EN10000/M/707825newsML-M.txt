* Canada &apos;s dollar opened flat at C $ 1.3740 ( US $ 0.7278 ) in light trading on Friday after a touch of profit-taking last night in overseas trading , traders said . 
Wateridge said that an apparent economic slowdown in the United States had created an ideal environment for continued strengthening of the Canadian currency . 
on Wednesday , the U.S. Federal Reserve decided at the end of its Federal Open Market Committee meeting that unexpectedly low economic growth in the second quarter justified a decision to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged . 
on Thursday , the U.S. Department of Labor reported that U.S. non-farm payrolls grew by only 217,000 in June , while unemployment rose to five percent from 4.8 percent . 
analysts had said that any number over 240,000 would have been considered inflationary and led to some weakening in the value of the Canadian dollar . 
the tame numbers were spawning a strong Canada dollar rally that would likely continue through next week , said one trader at a Canadian bank . 
overseas , all eyes were on the British pound , which has soared against major currencies as investors take advantage of Britain &apos;s robust economic growth and rising interest rates . 
the pound is at a five-year high against the German mark . 
on the crosses , the Canadian dollar dipped to 82.58 Japanese yen from Thursday &apos;s 82.68 yen and climbed to 1.2752 German marks from Thursday &apos;s 1.2749 marks .
