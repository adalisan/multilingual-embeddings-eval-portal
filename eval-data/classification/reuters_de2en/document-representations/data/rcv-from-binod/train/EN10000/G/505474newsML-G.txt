U.S. and Saudi intelligence authorities have linked a senior Iranian government official to a group of Shiite Moslems suspected of bombing a U.S. military compound in Saudi Arabia last year , the Washington Post reported in Sunday editions . 
U.S. and Arab officials said Brig. 
Ahmad Sherifi , a senior Iranian intelligence officer and a top official in Iran &apos;s Revolutionary Guards , met two years before the bombing with Hani Abd Rahim Sayegh , a Saudi Shiite arrested in Canada last month as &quot; a direct participant &quot; in the June 25 blast that killed 19 U.S. servicemen . 
the intelligence tying Sherifi to Sayegh has persuaded a growing number of U.S. and Saudi officials of Iran &apos;s direct involvement in the attack at the Khobar Towers housing complex , the newspaper said , quoting U.S. and Arab officials . 
&quot; Iran was the organising force behind it , &quot; one U.S. official told the paper . 
no comment was immediately available on the report from the State Department or the FBI , which is the lead U.S. agency on the investigation . 
Saudi Arabia is handling the investigation since it took place on its territory . 
the evidence of Iranian links to the Saudi Shiites suspected in the Khobar bombing includes bank checks signed by Sherifi , Arab sources told the Post , although it was unclear whether the checks were given to Sayegh or other suspects . 
much of the information came from intercepts of telephone calls Sayegh made to his wife and family in Saudi Arabia from Canada before he was arrested , the newspaper said . 
unaware his phone was taped over a seven-month period , Sayegh disclosed details of his role in the bombing and named others with whom he collaborated , the sources told the paper . 
the Post quoted the officials as saying the evidence appeared to show a conclusive link to Sherifi , also known as Abu Jalal , but one U.S. official said it did not &quot; rise to the level ( necessary ) for a criminal prosecution . 
Canadian court documents contend Sayegh drove a surveillance car behind the explosives-filled tanker used to demolish the Khobar complex . 
Sayegh denies any involvement and says he was in Syria at the time of the attack . 
Sherifi &apos;s duties include organising Hezbollah cells in Arab countries around the Gulf , the newspaper quoted U.S. and Arab sources as saying . 
he was implicated during a trial in Bahrain last year for 15 Bahraini Shiite dissidents convicted of several hotel and restaurant bombings which killed more than 20 people . 
separately , the Post reported that a second Air Force investigation has again exonerated all officers who were responsible for security at Khobar Towers . 
the Air Force reopened its inquiry into whether any officers were negligent in safeguarding the complex against terrorist attack in January , after pressure by top Pentagon officials who were dissatisfied with the initial probe . 
the first report concluded that the bombing would have occurred regardless of any chain of command that might have been in effect . 
it said that nine commanders who had a role in protecting the apartment buildings had performed their duties as well as could be expected given the limited extent of U.S. intelligence warnings at the time . 
no comment was immediately available from the Defence Department .
