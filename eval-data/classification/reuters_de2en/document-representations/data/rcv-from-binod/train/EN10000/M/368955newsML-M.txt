European jet fuel premiums to gas oil futures were holding steady on Tuesday with outright prices reflecting gains on IPE gas oil futures . 
traders said there were several cargoes looking for homes , but that the high February gas oil screen , which was showing backwardation of up to $ 10 a tonne for much of Tuesday , was putting buyers off . 
&quot; Hopefully when the Feb contract expires tomorrow , we will get some liquidity , &quot; said one trader .
