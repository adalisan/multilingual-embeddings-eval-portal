the White House said on Monday it was not concerned about new economic indicators showing consumer spending was slowing and spending on new construction dropping . 
&quot; The fact that the economy would slow a little bit is not seen as a negative here given the very strong performance that we talked about in the first quarter , &quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters . 
spending on all types of new construction dropped in April for the first time in four months , the Commerce Department said Monday , though the housing sector remained exceptionally strong . 
total spending dropped one percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 596.9 billion after a sharply revised 0.1 percent increase in March that previously was reported as a 0.2 percent decrase . 
the falloff in April construction spending was the first since last December , when it also was down by 1 percent . 
consumer spending edged up at its slowest rate in seven months during April , the Department also said , kept in check by slim income gains in a fresh sign of slowing economic momentum . 
spending rose just 0.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.35 trillion after a revised 0.2 percent increase in March . 
incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources were up an identical 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.75 trillion following a strong 0.6 percent rise in March .
