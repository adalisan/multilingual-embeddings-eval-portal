some brutal hitting by Mark Waugh set up a comfortable 50-run victory for Australia in their day / night match against Boland on Tuesday . 
Waugh , who retired after making 101 , spent 68 deliveries completing his half century but then put the Boland bowlers to the sword with a second 50 off just 25 deliveries . 
twice he hit three sixes in an over . 
captain Mark Taylor continued his return to form with a watchful 56 from 86 balls , Michael Bevan hit 80 not out from 66 deliveries and Justin Langer smashed 57 from 44 balls as Australia romped to 319 for three . 
Evert Ferreira ( 38 ) clipped Paul Reiffel for six over square leg in the fourth over of the reply to show defiance and skipper Adrian Kuiper struck leg spinner Shane Warne for two sixes over midwicket but the game was never a real contest . 
Reiffel claimed three for 40 and Greg Blewett took the last three Boland wickets in 20 balls at a cost of 15 runs but the margin of victory flattered the home side . 
Australia now travel to Durban for a three-day game against Natal beginning on Thursday .
