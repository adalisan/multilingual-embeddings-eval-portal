holding pictures of relatives in Israeli jails , about 200 Palestinian women and children marched in a peaceful demonstration in Gaza City on Monday demanding their release , witnesses said . 
&quot; Prisoners suffer from terrible conditions and some are now on hunger strike , &quot; Intisar al-Wazir , minister of social welfare in the Palestinian Authority , said during the protest . 
despite peace agreements that gave the Palestine Liberation Organisation control over the lives of most Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , human rights groups say Israel is still holding about 5,000 Arabs in jails inside its territory . 
Israel freed some of the prisoners , jailed for resisting Israeli occupation , following a self-rule deal signed last year and agreed to discuss releasing others . 
prisoners relatives said they had been facing difficulties visiting inmates in Israeli jails because of Israeli closures imposed frequently on the West Bank and Gaza Strip . 
&quot; Peace without freeing the prisoners is not peace , &quot; said Um Mahmoud , a mother who had not seen her 23-year-old son Mahmoud for three months .
