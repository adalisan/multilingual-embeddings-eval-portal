American Steve Fossett was over the Sahara Desert on Friday , his expedition said , still drifting toward Libya and a possible end to his attempt to become the first to circle the globe nonstop in a balloon . 
at 7 : 30 a.m. est ( 1230 GMT ) his flight headquarters in Chicago said the 52-year-old commodities broker aboard the &quot; Solo Spirit &quot; was over north central Algeria high above the Sahara . 
his speed was down to 58 knots , considerably slower than the pace which sped him across the Atlantic in three days following his lift-off late on Monday night from St. Louis . 
everything was going well with the flight , a spokesman said , except his route which continued to take him toward Libya , whose government has not yet granted permission to enter its airspace . 
the expedition has attempted to apply international pressure on Libya to say something one way or the other about using its airspace but so far there has been no word and Fossett may have to land rather than take a chance . 
he had hoped to skirt Libya by catching different winds at varying altitudes -- the only kind of control he has over the craft . 
but that apparently has not worked so far and the silver balloon was still headed for Libya , whose fractious relations with the United States have left the two countries without formal diplomatic ties . 
a chase plane sent out by the expedition had found Fossett and was keeping watch on him , a spokesman said . 
it was not known how soon he would reach the Libyan border but his trackers had estimated it might occur on Saturday . 
the dangers of entering foreign airspace were illustrated by two American balloonists who died in 1995 . 
they were shot down by Belarus military who claimed they had no clearance to enter its air space . 
organisers said they had been cleared . 
Fossett already holds the record for the longest solo manned balloon flight -- 5,435.8 miles ( 8,747 km ) on a voyage from South Korea to Canada -- a mark that he would better on this voyage at some point over southeast Algeria , the expedition said . 
British tycoon Richard Branson and Swiss pilot Jean Piccard , who tried and failed in separate missions this month to capture the record Fossett is seeking , had said they would fly Branson &apos;s citation , a small corporate jet , to circle the balloon as a welcome sometime after he passed Gibraltar but the expedtion said on Friday it did not know if that had happened . 
Branson was one of those who had been trying to intercede with the Libyan government to win Fossett permission to fly over the country . 
the expedition &apos;s Internet site carried an appeal for letters to President Bill Clinton to try to resolve the problem . 
Fossett &apos;s Internet site is http : / / www.luc.edu / solo . 
his pursuit of one of manned flight &apos;s oldest goals was forced to take a more southerly path than originally planned after he could not win permission from Russia to cross that country on a northern trans-European route . 
language barriers in dealing with air traffic control and a number of other problems were involved . 
if the Libyan question is resolved Fossett hoped to cross Iran , Afghanistan , Pakistan , China , Mongolia , China again , perhaps Korea and then head out across the Pacific in a voyage that coule take as long as 18 days . 
he is riding in an unpressurized , oblong yellow capsule 6-1 / 2 by four foot ( two by 1.3 metres ) that is 5-1 / 2 feet ( 1.7 metres ) high . 
he has been eating packaged prepared meals and has a small stove to prepare coffee . 
he has already gone much farther than the two rival expeditions which tried for the record in recent days . 
Piccard and Wim Verstraeten wound up in the Mediterranean on Sunday six hours after taking off from the Swiss Alps in pursuit of the record . 
Branson and two crew members brought their Virgin Global Challenger balloon down in Algeria last week less than a day after taking off from Morocco .
