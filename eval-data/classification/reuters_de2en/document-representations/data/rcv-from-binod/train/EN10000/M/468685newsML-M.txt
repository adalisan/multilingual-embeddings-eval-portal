Dutch bonds ended down on Wednesday , below the levels they had reached around lunchtime . 
although a 0.25 percent hike in U.S. interest rates had been widely expected , Dutch bonds had opened sharply lower as they tracked their German counterparts . 
&quot; apparently , not everybody had pencilled the hike in . 
but apart from that , bond prices had been at fairly high levels . 
without the Fed story , we would also have slipped somewhat , &quot; one dealer said . 
the release of higher than expected U.S. February durable goods data at 1330 GMT killed the slight midsession recovery . 
&quot; If we have a row of strong figures like these , the Fed will be obliged to use heavier weapons , &quot; one dealer said , adding he expected another rise in U.S. interest rates around May . 
&quot; This time , it was more of a warning . 
real inflationary pressure would have to be countered with a 50 basis point hike , &quot; he said . 
U.S. durable goods orders rose 1.5 percent in February compared to an upward revised 4.1 percent increase in January . 
analysts had forecast a 0.4 percent fall for February . 
dealers said market players were mostly sidelined , apart from some bargain-hunting and professional position shuffling . 
one dealer said professional traders were shortening the duration of their positions . 
&quot; They want to be somewhat closer to home , &quot; he said . 
another said the wish for shorter-dated paper was inspired by market uncertainty . 
&quot; Opinions on the market &apos;s direction are divided , &quot; he said . 
one dealer said he saw no risks of interest rate hikes in Germany or the Netherlands in the near future . 
&quot; There &apos;s still a lot of pain in Europe and if the dollar strengthens too much against the mark , Germany would try to halt that by intervening rather than by moving its rates , &quot; he said .
