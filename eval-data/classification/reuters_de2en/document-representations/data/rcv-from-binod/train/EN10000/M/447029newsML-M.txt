rising diesel stockpiles in China &apos;s southwestern province of Sichuan have caused local prices to drop , the Market Daily said on Monday . 
diesel prices had dropped by 314 yuan ( $ 37 ) per tonne from the end of 1996 in the province and were expected to fall further , the newspaper said but did not elaborate . 
diesel stockpiles in the province were 24,000 tonnes by late February , a rise of 60.6 percent compared with January , it said , attributing the rise to the state &apos;s adjustment of diesel prices . 
China raised domestic ex-refinery prices twice in the fourth quarter of last year to try to boost diesel output to ease domestic shortages . 
stockpiles of gasoline in the province were 30,400 tonnes by late February , down by 8.7 percent from January , it said , adding that gasoline prices in Sichuan were stable because of sufficient domestic stockpiles . 
China produced 3.8452 million tonnes of diesel in January , up 12 percent compared with the year-ago period , the State Statistical Bureau said . 
China produced 2.8086 million tonnes of gasoline in January , down by 2.2 percent compared with the year-ago period , the bureau said .
