- Proposal for a Council decision on objectives and detailed rules for multiannual guidance programmes IV , restructuring the Community fisheries sector for the period from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2002 . 
the Council will explore solutions and give political guidance on the major issues , such as rates of reduction in capacities ; effort management ( reduction of the duration of fishing activity ) ; segmentation ( a new segmentation of fleet is proposed according to species , gear but also by area , which should be comparable with the existing one under MAGP Ill and should allow vessels to move from one segment to another in the course of MAGP IV ) ; scope of the exemption for small scale fisheries ; special treatment of static gear , which should not result of a discrimination against the towed gear segment ; socio-economic repercussions of fleet capacity reduction and suitability of existing accompanying measures with a view to providing an adequate response to the consequence of restructuring of fleets ; respect of the principle of relative stability , ensuring primacy of quotas and right and capability to take them fully . 
- European Commissioner Bonino presents proposal for Council regulation on technical measures for conservation of fishery resources . 
the aim of the proposal is to improve the effectiveness of existing technical conservation measures to avoid the catch of juvenile fish . 
this should be done by improving the selectivity of fishing gear ( mainly changing the mesh closing certain fishing areas during certain seasons where juveniles are in high densities ) . 
the proposal also aims at simplifying the rules so that can be better enforced . 
- Proposal for Council regulation on common marketing standards for certain fishery products . 
the main objectives of the proposal are to consolidate in a single legislative act the basic Regulations as well as the amendments and modifications which have been made since those regulations were adopted ; to bring the market standards into line with changes in production ; to adjust freshness ratings distinguished by product group which will make grading easier through the use of simpler , more appropriate freshness criteria ; to remind that technical conservation measures should take precedence over minimum commercial sizes ; to strengthen the efficiency of market standards with the aim of improving market quality .
