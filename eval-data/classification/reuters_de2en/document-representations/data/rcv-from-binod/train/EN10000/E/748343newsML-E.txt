Federal Reserve Vice Chair Alice Rivlin said on Wednesday she opposed Congressional efforts to change the goals for monetary policy that are currently set by the Humphrey-Hawkins Act . 
&quot; It would be a mistake , &quot; she told the House Banking Committee in reply to a question . 
under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act , the central bank is required to seek balanced economic growth with maximum employment and stable prices . 
some Republican lawmakers want to scrap the law and set price stability as the Fed &apos;s primary , or sole goal . 
Federal Reserve Governor Laurence Meyer said he also would oppose setting a single goal for the Fed of achieving price stability . 
new York Fed President William McDonough also saw no reason to change the Humphrey-Hawkins Act , although he said that was up to Congress to decide . 
&quot; The Humphrey-Hawkins Act gives me all the clarity I need , &quot; he said . 
he added that changing the law probably would not affect Fed policy . 
he said that Fed policymakers want maximum sustainable growth and believe that growth can be maximized through the pursuit of price stability .
