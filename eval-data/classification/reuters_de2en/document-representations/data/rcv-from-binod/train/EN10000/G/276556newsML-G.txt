Ukraine accused Canada on Thursday of illegally arresting a Ukrainian diplomat who was expelled this week after being charged with drunk driving , bribing a police officer and possession of stolen property . 
&quot; The arrest was illegal , &quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Serheyev told a news conference held after vice-consul Olexander Yushko , 32 , returned to Ukraine . 
Serheyev said Canadian police violated the Vienna Convention , which grants foreign service personnel diplomatic immunity . 
Ukrainian authorities said Yushko had a blood alcohol level three times the legal driving limit when he was arrested at the end of October , but that police misinterpreted his attempts to pay a fine on the spot as an offer of a bribe . 
they also said a police search of Yushko &apos;s car , which yielded a pair of stolen license plates , was illegal under the Vienna convention . 
they said the diplomat &apos;s driver had found the plates and meant to return them the day after the arrest . 
Yushko was declared persona non grata last Monday and given two days to leave Canada . 
&quot; The police did not behave in a civilised way , &quot; Serheyev said . 
&quot; They treated him like he was a criminal . 
foreign Ministry officials said the incident would not affect Canadian-Ukrainian relations .
