a Vietnamese refugee seeking asylum in the Czech Republic is holed up in the Czech embassy in Thailand , an embassy official said on Friday . 
the refugee , identified as Phan Kim Long , 44 , sought asylum at the embassy on Monday and has been staying there since , the embassy &apos;s consul Jana Chaloubkova told Reuters . 
&quot; His case is now under discussion between the Czech and Thai authorities . 
I cannot say anything more for the time being , &quot; she added . 
long , a former South Vietnamese military officer , said in a petition dated November 2 to Czech President Vaclav Havel that he had escaped from the northeastern Thai Sikhiu refugee camp in July . 
he claimed that he had no choice but to ask for asylum because he was not chosen to be sent to a third country under the United Nations High Commissisoner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) resettlement plan . 
&quot; Vietnamese asylum seekers are being repatriated voluntarily or by force . 
in my case , I cannot return to my motherland in safety and escaped from Sikhiu camp on July 16 , &quot; Long said in his petition , a copy of which was obtained by Reuters . 
he said he had been sentenced to jail in Vietnam for 12 years to be followed by five years of house arrest for attempting to escape overseas in 1977 . 
he had been in prison for 4-1 / 2 years when he escaped from Vietnam . 
&quot; For me , repatriation will certainly result in re-imprisonment and continued persecution , &quot; Long said in his petition . 
he asked the Czech president to consider his request for asylum . 
&quot; All I need is a place to live like a human being , with all his rights and dignity . 
please save my life , &quot; he added . 
the U.S.-based Legal Assistance for Vietnamese Asylum Seekers said in a statement received here that Long was in danger of being repatriated by Thailand if his request was not granted . 
nearly 2,000 Vietnamese who were denied settlement in a third country and were stranded in the Sikhiu holding camp are being set back to Veitnam under the orderly departure Programme . 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ceased all funding for Vietnamese &quot; boatpeople &quot; in Thailand and other countries in the region in June . 
the asylum seekers fled Vietnam after the communists won the Vietnam War in 1975 .
