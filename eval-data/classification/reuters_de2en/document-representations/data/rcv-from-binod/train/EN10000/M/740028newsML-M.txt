NYMEX Henry hub natgas futures were expected to open little changed Friday despite still-firm physical prices , in line with early over-the-counter quotes ( OTC ) , market sources said . 
early August OTC quotes were stradling yesterday &apos;s close at $ 2.175 per million British thermal units . 
&quot; Cash is reacting accordingly because of the cuts , but by Monday things should be back to normal and gas should be flowing at normal rates , &quot; said one futures trader , referring to U.S. Gulf production cuts this week due to Hurricane Danny . 
cash quotes this morning at Henry hub , the NYMEX delivery point in Erath , Louisiana , ranged from $ 2.27-2.34 , steady to slightly over Thursday &apos;s levels . 
while most agreed milder weather and the restoration of shut in gas should could put the market back on the defensive next week , they said little downside was expected today , with shorts still nervously eyeing tropical depression 5 in the lesser Antilles .
