the African economy should build on the 4.8 percent growth rate achieved in 1996 over the medium term , but Africa must diversify away from commodities to secure sustainable growth , the African Development Bank ( AfDB ) said . 
in its African Development Report , published to coincide with its annual meeting here this week , the AfDB said the 4.8 percent growth in real GDP after inflation in 1996 was up from 2.8 percent in 1995 and an average 1.6 percent from 1990-1994 . 
&quot; For the first time in many years , GDP growth rates caught up with and surpassed population growth in a number of countries , &quot; it said . 
the AfDB is expecting further economic growth of 4.4 percent in 1997 , below the 5.0 percent projected by the International Monetary Fund , and 4.6 percent over the period 1997-2001 . 
but the AfDB warned that growth varied from country to country , and that the recovery was fragile . 
it was based largely on agriculture and services , with little spill-over effect on manufacturing and other sectors . 
&quot; Despite the encouraging performance and outlook , economic diversification is a challenge that has yet to be addressed if rates of output growth that yield sustained increases in per capita incomes are to be attained , &quot; it said . 
in sharp contrast to the general optimism , the AfDB said crises in the Great Lakes region , covering Rwanda , Burundi and the eastern part of the former Zaire , had caused per capita GDP in those countries to fall by 63 percent from 1990 to 1996 . 
it estimated that the economy in the new Democratic Republic of Congo had fallen by an average of 8.2 percent per year from 1991 to 1995 despite its abundant natural resources . 
the title of this year &apos;s report reflected the main concern of the annual meeting and related events here this week -- &quot; Fostering Private Sector Development in Africa &quot; . 
Temitope Oshikoya , head of the AfDB &apos;s research division , told Reuters the Bank existed to promote economic development and relieve poverty . 
&quot; But you can &apos;t relieve poverty without economic growth , and the private sector has proved to be the engine of growth , &quot; he said . 
the report listed a whole series of constraints on private enterprise development in Africa , including the unstable macroeconomic environment , the legal framework , poor infrastructure and education , and weak financial systems . 
many countries were pursusing policy reforms to attract investors and must persevere , the Bank said , even if investment was slow in coming . 
foreign investment in Africa is concentrated in a few countries , like Egypt , Morroco and Nigeria . 
on the other hand , the report reminds the reader of the vibrancy of Africa &apos;s own small-scale entrepreneurs . 
the private sector -- a handful of medium and large firms and a mass of tiny ventures like food stalls -- accounts for over two-thirds of Africa &apos;s GDP and half of all investment , it said .
