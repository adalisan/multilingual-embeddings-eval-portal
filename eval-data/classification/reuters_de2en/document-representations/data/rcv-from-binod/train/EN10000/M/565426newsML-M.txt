* Lithuanian shares were mixed on Wednesday and the sluggish market remained inactive , dealers said . 
* Kalnapilis brewery gained big , rising ten percent to 3.85 litas . 
* Savings Bank fell steeply to 255 litas from 284 litas . 
Lithuanian shares were mixed on Wednesday and activity on the struggling bourse was slow , dealers said . 
&quot; Trade is down from yesterday , &quot; Arvydas Jacikevichius of brokerage house Suprema told Reuters . 
the bourse has struggled to regain the momentum it had early in the year , when prices soared to record highs . 
dealers and analysts say that bull run was speculative and the market has since experienced a long , painful correction . 
one of the session &apos;s few big gainers was Kalnapilis brewery , which advanced 10 percent to 3.85 litas . 
&quot; It should continue to gain and reach to 4.00 to 4.50 litas in the nearset future , &quot; Jacikevichius said . 
on the down side , the state-run Savings Bank fell ten percent to 255 litas from 284 litas . 
Hermis Bank , which earlier announced a preliminary net profit of 3.2 million litas in April and 12.5 million litas in the first four months of the year , saw its shares drop to 175 litas from 180 litas . 
&quot; When the market is going down , the results are not going to have much of an effect , &quot; said Tomas Andrejauskas of Suprema . 
&quot; When the market starts to go up again , Hermis shares will have a higher relative performance , &quot; he added . 
Lithuanian Gas remained unchanged at 2.00 litas . 
Rokishkis cheese , which reported on Wednesday that its sales went down slightly in April , fell to 44.50 litas from 44.95 litas .
