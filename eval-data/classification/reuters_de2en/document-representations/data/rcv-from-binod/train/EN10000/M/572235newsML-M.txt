firm fuel oil swaps and SIMEX futures contract boosted sentiment in the high sulphur fuel oil market on Friday , with the market strongly anticipating a local trader to continue his purchase . 
the 180-cst grade was offered at $ 102.50 per tonne for late May delivery but there was no buyer . 
the local trader on Thursday bought a 180-cst cargo from an European major at $ 102.00 per tonne for May 26-30 delivery , $ 2.00 higher than the traded level earlier this week . 
the 380-cst grade , which was traded at $ 91.00 per tonne last week , was bid at $ 94.50 . 
&quot; The demand is there , for bunkers or power stations , but it &apos;s so far regular and not that significant , &quot; said one trader , predicting prices to stay firm . 
&quot; sentiment is quite bullish at the moment , &quot; he added . 
fuel oil swaps jumped on expectations of fresh physical market demand , with May rising to $ 103.75 / $ 104.50 from $ 101.50 / $ 102.50 and June advancing to $ 102 / $ 103 from $ 99.50 / $ 100.50 . 
SIMEX fuel oil futures also saw some sharp gains , with June jumping $ 2.00 to $ 102.00 and July inching up 80 cents to $ 100.50 . 
block trades of two 5,000 lots each was also heard traded at around $ 93.30 on Thursday . 
most traders agreed that tighter summer supplies from the Middle East and South Korea &apos;s maintenance turnarounds in May and June did provide fundamental support for the market . 
recent fuel oil import tender from Taiwan and South Korea also boosted sentiment , traders said . 
Taiwan &apos;s state Chinese Petroleum Corp said on Friday it had bought two 38,000-tonne cargoes of 0.5-percent fuel oil at around $ 117 and $ 120 per tonne respectively . 
the Korean Electric Power Company ( KEPCO ) has tendered to buy two 70,000-tonne , 540-centistoke fuel oil for July delivery . 
the tender for 0.3-percent fuel oil will close on May 16 and is valid for three days .
