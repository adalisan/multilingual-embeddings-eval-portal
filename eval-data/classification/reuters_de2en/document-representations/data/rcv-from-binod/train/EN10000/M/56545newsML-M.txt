IPE Brent crude returned to session lows on Monday afternoon , depressed by easing Middle East tension and a technical correction , brokers said . 
Nov Brent touched $ 22.35 a barrel before recovering to $ 22.46 by 1422 GMT , still 67 cents down from Friday &apos;s close . 
crude was expected to stay on the defensive after the U.S. backed away from further missile attacks against Iraq and Baghdad said it would no longer fire at U.S. and allied warplanes enforcing &quot; no-fly &quot; zones over Iraq . 
brokers said Brent was under pressure from trade selling of the Brent-WTI arbitrage , but the market remained cautious . 
&quot; There &apos;s been arb selling at around $ 1 ( a barrel ) . 
nobody &apos;s really going short in case another headline comes out and they can &apos;t get it back , &quot; said one . 
Kuwait on Monday approved a U.S. request to deploy additional ground troops there to expand the U.S. military presence . 
any escalation of hostility in the region would prop up a market already supported by the tight inventory situation in the U.S. and Europe in the approach to winter . 
&quot; There &apos;s been a big shift in sentiment but underlying it there are still bullish fundamentals , &quot; said a broker . 
Nov Brent is already well off the post-Gulf War peak of $ 24.39 touched on Thursday by the expired October contract . 
in the gas oil pit , meanwhile , the October contract was $ 7.75 a tonne lower at $ 214.00 . 
the Oct / Nov backwardation lost 50 cents to $ 5.50 .
