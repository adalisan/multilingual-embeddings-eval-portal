Sri Lanka on Thursday predicted further rebel assaults on merchant ships around northern Jaffna following two violent , sea hijackings . 
&quot; They ( rebels ) will continue doing these kind of things , hijacking ships and attacking them , but we will somehow overcome this problem , &quot; military spokesman Sarath Munasinghe told a news conference in Colombo . 
liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) rebels torched a refugee ship off Sri Lanka &apos;s northwest coast last week and seized a North Korean vessel carrying food to Jaffna on Monday . 
Deputy Minister for Defence Anuruddha Ratwatte said in parliament that the government was committed to supplying food to people in the former rebel stronghold of Jaffna and the northern Wanni region , most of which is currently held by the LTTE . 
an overnight statement from the rebels , who are fighting for a separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka &apos;s north and east , said the North Korean ship Morang Bong was seized because it &quot; was sailing within Tamil Eelam &apos;s territorial waters &quot; . 
&quot; The ship ignored orders to stop and one crewman was killed in the process of bringing the ship under control , &quot; it added . 
the body of the ship &apos;s fourth officer , sin Jwang-ho , 54 , was handed over by the rebels to the officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) on Thursday . 
another ship carrying 2,800 tonnes of supplies was set to leave Colombo for Jaffna , Munasinghe said . 
he declined to say whether the Sri Lankan navy would escort supply ships . 
government forces took control of the Jaffna peninsula in April last year after a lengthy offensive during which most of the population fled to the Wanni mainland further south . 
the government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the civil war , now in its 14th year .
