most LME metals fought off further lows in Monday afternoon trading but they still ended in the negative colunm . 
copper closed the afternoon kerb little changed from the morning , when it recovered slightly from a dip to $ 1,930 . 
it opened the afternoon rings looking like it might challenge the $ 1,950 / 5 barrier , but cash selling and a weaker spread punctured its confidence and it ended the kerb at $ 1,934 per tonne , down $ 23 . 
the cash / threes backwardation eased to $ 4 / $ 6 from $ 10 / $ 11 in the morning . 
LME stocks were expected to continue falling on Tuesday after declining by 18,450 tonnes on Friday . 
floor traders &apos; estimates ranged from a drop of 5,000 to 12,000 tonnes . 
&quot; Maybe after a few more draws the price will react , &quot; one trader said , noting that prices have had trouble breaching resistance at $ 1,950 and $ 1,970 despite weeks of strong stock declines . 
physical traders said scrap and off-grade Russian material was hard to come by and some customers were forced to substitute Grade A metal , helping the erosions in LME inventories . 
lead stabilised after hitting a seven-month low of $ 735 in the morning , ending the kerb at $ 738 , down $ 13 on the day . 
traders expected another modest stock draw on Tuesday . 
aluminium , however , returned to its morning low of $ 1,326 and closed the kerb there , finishing with a loss of $ 11 . 
last business in tin was also at the low of the day , $ 5,975 , down $ 85 from Friday and probing support . 
Monday &apos;s close matched the low of October 2 , the day after prices dived to $ 5,900 . 
nickel finished the day at $ 7,120 , down $ 30 and just above support at $ 7,110 , Friday &apos;s low . 
zinc ended at the cusp of support at $ 1,015 , down $ 11 . 
next support was pegged at $ 1,005 / 9 . 
Alloy closed weaker at $ 1,200 from $ 1,207 / 12 .
