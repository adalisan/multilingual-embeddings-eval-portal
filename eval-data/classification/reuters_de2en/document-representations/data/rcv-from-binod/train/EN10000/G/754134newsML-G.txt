British Jews said on Thursday there was a long way to go before the truth was established about Switzerland &apos;s involvement with Germany &apos;s World War Two Nazi regime . 
Swiss banks have acknowledged their shame about not doing enough over the past 50 years to find the heirs of Holocaust victims and other owners of nearly 1,800 dormant accounts whose names were published worldwide . 
the Board of Deputies of British Jews promised to help any of those in Britain who felt they might have a claim to make . 
Jewish leaders who have led an international battle for two years to get the names of the lost account holders praised the banks for breaking their strict code of secrecy . 
&quot; Yesterday &apos;s announcement is a welcome forward move but it is a pity that it has taken so long to reach this stage , &quot; a Board spokesman said . 
&quot; There is still much to be done to establish the truth of Switzerland &apos;s involvement with the Nazi regime and to ensure justice for the victims of the Holocaust and their descendants .
