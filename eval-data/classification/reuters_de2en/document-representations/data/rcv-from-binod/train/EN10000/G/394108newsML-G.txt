an umbrella group of Burmese exiles on Friday denied there was a split within the rebel Karen National Union ( KNU ) and said General Bo Mya remained the guerrilla &apos;s group leader in its fight for autonomy from Burma . 
the National Council of the Union of Burma ( NCUB ) said in a statement that Bo Mya &apos;s leadership was not threatened by internal conflicts within the KNU and such reports were misinformation planted by the Burmese government . 
senior KNU sources have said the organisation was racked by policy differences between hardline leader Bo Mya and moderate vice president Swe Seing , who wants to discuss peace . 
the KNU was formed in 1948 to fight for greater autonomy for the Karen state from the Rangoon central government . 
it is one of the few rebel groups that have rejected Rangoon &apos;s peace overtures and refused to lay down arms . 
fifteen other groups have already reached ceasefire agreements with the Burmese military junta . 
in the past 10 months , KNU representatives have met delegates of the SLORC four times to discuss peace initiatives , but they have all ended in failure because the KNU has refused to lay down arms before talks . 
the denial by the NCUB came after ethnic KNU spokesman NER Dah , who fled with thousands of Karen refugees to the Thai side after Burmese troops razed the group &apos;s key mobile jungle camps in eastern Burma , on Thursday called for peace talks with Burma .
