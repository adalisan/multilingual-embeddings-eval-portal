a U.S. appeals court ruled Tuesday that a federal judge wrongly allowed the Clinton White House to withhold 84 documents subpoenaed by a grand jury investigating former Agriculture Secretary Mike espy . 
the appeals court ordered the U.S. District Court judge to conduct a more detailed review of the documents , which have been at the centre of a long legal battle between the White House and independent counsel Donald Smaltz . 
the appeals court said the judge made a mistake by failing to provide any explanation or legal reasoning in rejecting a request from the prosecutors to force the White House to comply with the subpoena . 
Smaltz is investigating allegations that espy , who was appointed by President Clinton in 1993 , accepted illegal gifts from companies the Agriculture Department regulated . 
espy , who resigned in 1994 , has denied any wrongdoing . 
the grand jury , acting at Smaltz &apos;s direction , issued the subpoena in October 1994 for documents gathered in connection with a report by the White House counsel , made at Clinton &apos;s request , concerning the allegations . 
the report was made public , but the White House sought to keep the 84 supporting documents secret on the grounds of executive privilege and that such presidential communications and deliberations were covered . 
in a similar case , the White House has pending a Supreme Court appeal arguing that attorney-client privilege allows it to withhold from Whitewater prosecutors notes of talks by government lawyers with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton . 
in the espy case , the appeals court cited the Supreme Court &apos;s historic 1974 ruling in the Watergate tapes case involving President Nixon in laying out the principles the judge must balance in making a decision . 
Smaltz &quot; has demonstrated that it is likely the subpoenaed documents contain important evidence that is not available elsewhere , &quot; the appeals court said in the 55-page ruling . 
he &quot; has demonstrated a sufficient showing of need to obtain certain information in some of the documents . 
the decision was written by Judge Patricia Wald , who was named to the bench by President Carter . 
she was considered , but not selected , by Clinton as a possible candidate for attorney general in 1993 . 
she was joined in the decision by Judges Douglas Ginsburg , who was appointed in the mid-1980s by President Reagan , and Judith Rogers , a Clinton appointee . 
the legal battle previously had been conducted in secret , and the ruling marked the first public disclosure involving the details . 
small parts of the ruling still were kept secret on specific potential criminal charges . 
Wald said the test for the prosecutors to overcome a claim of presidential privilege involved showing why the evidence was important to the investigation and why it was unavailable from another source . 
&quot; We are ever mindful of the dangers involved in cloaking government operations in secrecy and in placing obstacles in the path of the grand jury in its investigatory mission , &quot; she said . 
but Wald also acknowledged that a &quot; powerful counterweight &quot; existed in preserving informed presidential deliberations . 
she said virtually all of the documents had been written by White House lawyers and that presidential privilege did apply .
