three East Timorese seeking political asylum were apparently rebuffed by the French embassy in Jakarta on Wednesday , and diplomats said missions were being tougher on people trying to flee the troubled territory . 
East Timorese sources said the three men , who slipped past security guards at the embassy early in the mmorning in a bid for political asylum in Portugal , were evicted from the mission . 
a spokesman for the embassy said it was investigating the incident and was trying to contact locally-hired security guards on the night shift . 
he said he could not comment immediately on whether any Timorese had been evicted . 
&quot; I cannot say this is not true but we have not had a report about something like that , &quot; spokesman Eric Pilloton said . 
&quot; There are no Timorese in the French embassy . 
diplomats said it appeared some embassies were turning a blind-eye to how local security guards employed by foreign missions dealt with break-ins by East Timorese . 
many of the guards have ex-military or police backgrounds . 
altogether 89 East Timorese have been granted asylum in Portugal after a series of break-ins into Jakarta missions since September 1995 . 
that , however , may now be at an end , diplomats said . 
&quot; The tolerance level has gone right down . 
the security guards get to them first and nobody stops them , &quot; one diplomat said . 
another diplomat said it appeared embassies were ignoring any moral commitment they might have under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which guarantees the right of asylum . 
diplomats said that earlier this month five Timorese were removed from the Hungarian embassy after entering the compound . 
a Hungarian diplomat said he did not know of the incident . 
the Dutch embassy however confirmed one of the five jumped the wall of the Hungarian embassy into the Swiss embassy before fleeing into the adjacent Netherlands mission in the early hours of October 3 . 
&quot; There was an attempt to enter a nearby embassy . 
on the run , one person reached the premises of the Netherlands embassy . 
from there , he was immediately removed for reasons of self-defence , &quot; Dutch embassy spokesman Ernst Schmidt said . 
other sources said security agencies were waiting for the Timorese man upon his explusion from the Dutch embassy and he spent almost two weeks in custody before being released . 
in the latest French embassy incident , its seventh break-in since September last year , the Timorese identified themselves by name to reporters and said they were seeking asylum to protest Indonesia &apos;s 1976 annexation of the former Portuguese colony . 
East Timorese sources told Reuters hours later that security guards in the embassy had evicted the three men from the mission . 
they said two of the three were injured while being forced out . 
it was not immediately known where they had gone . 
&quot; We are seeking political asylum in Portugal . 
we feel that our homeland has been taken over by the Indonesian military , &quot; one of the men , who identified himself as Sabino D &apos;Arujo , 26 , told Reuters shortly after the break-in . 
&quot; In East Timor we are always chased by the troops of the Suharto regime , &quot; said a second man who identified himself as Alberto Da Silva , 23 . 
the third man was named by his colleagues as Anatolio Francesco Arujo , 21 . 
the embassy break-in came a day after Indonesia &apos;s President Suharto visited East Timor for only the third time since he took power three decades ago and less than a week after two East Timorese won the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize . 
Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year in a move not recognised by the United Nations .
