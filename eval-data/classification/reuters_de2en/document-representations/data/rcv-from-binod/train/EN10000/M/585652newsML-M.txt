a jittery gold market seesawed through Thursday in reaction to news that Germany may revalue its gold reserves , although the Germans said that the move would not involve selling any bullion . 
gold prices have sagged in recent months on fears that other central banks may follow a Dutch lead in selling gold from reserves , especially where nations need to straighten their finances to qualify for European Monetary Union . 
dealers said it seemed that the German move to revalue its gold was linked with its budget deficit and EMU criteria . 
although no sales of gold are envisaged , revaluing the reserves could free up other assets . 
gold dropped $ 2 per ounce in New York late Wednesday on the first word that Germany was going to reassess the use to it of gold reserves of 95 million ounces held by the Bundesbank . 
but late in the London day it snapped briefly higher when Finance Minister Theo Waigel insisted that , whatever Germany does , it would not sell a single ounce . 
it closed in London at $ 346.70 / $ 347.20 per ounce down $ 1.70 from Wednesday but after a bounce of almost a dollar immediately after Waigel &apos;s statement . 
gold dealers were nonethless far from sanguine after Waigel &apos;s statement . 
&quot; The fact that they are talking about gold is bad enough . 
a few years ago this would have knocked $ 20- $ 30 off the price , &quot; one said . 
Germany has long been one of the staunchest advocates of holding gold in reserves as an anti-inflation instrument . 
it has vociferously opposed proposals by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) to sell part of its gold reserves to finance an aid fund for the world &apos;s poorest countries on the basis that it would send the wrong signals to the market . 
gold prices have been depressed for months under threat of European central banks selling from reserves as they tried to steer their economies through the Maastricht Treaty criteria for entry to European Monetary Union due at the end of next year . 
in January the Dutch central bank ended months of speculation when it announced it had sold 300 tonnes of gold late last year . 
the market was unsettled later when Switzerland , another staunch supporter of gold as an asset , said it would revalue its reserves .
