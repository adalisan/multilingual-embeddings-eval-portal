gas production by UNOCAL Thailand , a unit of UNOCAL Corp , in the Gulf of Thailand reached a record 1,070 million cubic feet a day ( mmcfd ) in late December , a company official said on Monday . 
the level , recorded on December 28 from its nine fields , surpassed the previous record of 1,001 mmcfd set in October , she told Reuters . 
&quot; The new record resulted from higher purchase requirements from the Petroleum Authority of Thailand during the last week of December , &quot; the official said . 
&quot; This underlines our readiness to supply more gas to Thai consumers . 
the company aimed to raise its average production to over 1,000 mmcfd from January against 955 mmcfd in December . 
&quot; We have that capability . 
but it also depends on PTT &apos;s second pipeline , &quot; she said , referring to the pipeline which is still on a test run . 
UNOCAL Thailand is currently the biggest natural gas supplier in the country . 
gas produced by the firm , on behalf of its co-concessionaires Mitsui Oil Exploration and PTT Exploration &amp; Production , is mostly used by the state-run Electricity Generation Authority of Thailand ( EGAT ) to generate power .
