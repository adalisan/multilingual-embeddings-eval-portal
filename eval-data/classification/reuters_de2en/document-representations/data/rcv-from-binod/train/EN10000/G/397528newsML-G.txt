Georgia on Monday condemned a weekend blast in the breakaway region of Abkhazia which killed three Russian peacekeepers . 
the head of the Russian mission blamed the attack on Georgian &quot; terrorists &quot; . 
the incident , in which one serviceman was also seriously wounded , occurred on Saturday evening when the armoured personnel carrier they were riding in hit a mine in the Gali region , near the border between Georgia and Abkhazia . 
the Georgian Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that the government condemned &quot; terrorist acts against the Russian peacekeeping forces based in Abkhazia &quot; . 
&quot; The government of Georgia will take measures to strengthen the safety of the Russian peacekeepers , &quot; the statement . 
the head of the Russian peacekeeping mission in Abkhazia said Georgian &quot; White Legion &quot; guerrillas were behind the attack . 
Major-General Dolya Babenkov , whose 2,500 strong force has patrolled the Abkhaz &quot; security zone &quot; since 1994 , suggested the &quot; White Legion &quot; had links with some Georgian authorities . 
&quot; According to my information , there are ties between the group and certain Georgian structures , &quot; he said , quoted by Russia &apos;s Interfax news agency . 
the peacekeepers &apos; presence , along with that of a 133-member United Nations Observer force , is sanctioned by the Georgian government and the Abkhaz leadership . 
but some Georgians , especially among refugees who fled the separatist takeover of Abkhazia , are opposed to the Russian involvement and want to re-take the region by force . 
the head of the &quot; White Legion &quot; group , Zurab Samushia , claimed responsibility last week for a spate of recent similar mine-laying incidents in an interview with a Georgian newspaper . 
some U.N. observers believe armed groups of ethnic Georgians lay mines in an effort to force the Russian peacekeeping force to leave Abkhazia . 
but they say a departure of the peacekeepers could re-ignite a full-scale war between the two sides . 
Abkhaz irregulars ousted Georgian troops in 1993 after a year-long conflict that killed over 10,000 . 
the lush Black Sea region has enjoyed de facto independence since then but has not been recognised by the international community . 
Tbilisi says it is prepared to grant wide autonomy but will not accept the &quot; confederative union &quot; that the Abkhaz offer . 
it also demands the repatriation to Abkhazia of at least 150,000 ethnic Georgian refugees who fled the war . 
Georgia has demanded that Russia do more to help it restore control over Abkhazia . 
otherwise , it says , it will not allow Moscow to keep three military bases it still has in the former Soviet republic of five million .
