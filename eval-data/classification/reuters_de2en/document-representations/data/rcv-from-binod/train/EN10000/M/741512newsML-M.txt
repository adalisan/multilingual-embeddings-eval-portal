bulls drove the Dow Jones Industrial average above the historic 8,000 mark last week before a sharp pullback Friday , and the bumpy ride is likely to continue this week . 
wall Street will contend with Fed chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s testimony before Congress and a quarterly earnings report from market heavyweight International Business machines Corp. 
&quot; The next few weeks might be a period of real nail biting , &quot; said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. &quot; Investors are very edgy and worried . 
we &apos;ve gone so far so fast , the concern is that we &apos;ve become very pricey or overvalued . 
the second deeper worry is that the economy is going to reaccelerate in the third quarter . 
Greenspan will deliver his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to the House Banking Subcommittee on Tuesday . 
he is due to appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday . 
&quot; Greenspan is really a focus for the week , &quot; said Phil Orlando of Value Line Asset Management . 
&quot; We don &apos;t know what he is going to say , but we think he &apos;s very pleased with the moderate pace of economic growth and the virtual absence of inflationary pressures . 
Orlando added : &quot; We call it the Goldilocks scenario , investment conditions are neither too hot nor too cold , corporate earnings are better than expected , the economy is showing modest growth , and there &apos;s a virtual absence of inflationary pressure . 
benign inflation data and strong corporate profit reports drove the Dow over the 8,000 mark last week before a bout of profit-taking . 
the Dow fell 130.31 points Friday to close at 7890.46 . 
for the week , it lost 31.36 points . 
despite the downturn at the week &apos;s end , analysts said the reasons for the bull market &apos;s run remain intact . 
&quot; The economy is still very good here and the trends that have put us higher here are still with us , &quot; said James Solloway of Argus Research . 
&quot; There &apos;s no reason for the Fed to make a more here , I don &apos;t see any end ( to the bull market ) in sight over the next week , ( or until ) the fundamentals change in any significant way . 
highlighting the corporate earnings reports this week are IBM &apos;s second quarter data , due Monday after the stock market &apos;s close . 
average estimates for computer maker &apos;s quarter are for $ 1.42 a share , up from $ 1.26 a year ago , according to First Call . 
on Friday , the goverment reports June durable goods orders and existing home sales . 
but the market is expected to take its first cue on the economy in the third quarter from the July 29 cost employment index . 
candidly , what everyone is looking at beyond next week is the employment cost index , and July payrolls in early August , &quot; Johnson said . 
the Dow has risen 23 percent since hitting its 1997 low in April at 6392 , and many think Wall Street is due for a correction . 
&quot; By any historical standard , the market is due for a correction of 10 percent , &quot; said Ricky Harrington of Interstate Johnson Lane . 
&quot; Right now you have to look at a correction of several 100 points . 
Harrington pointed to the market &apos;s poor reaction to Microsoft &apos;s earnings . 
Microsoft &apos;s second-quarter net , posted late last week , was in line with expectations , but below Wall Street &apos;s so-called &quot; whisper &quot; numbers , unpublished forecasts that circulate on the Street , and are often above published views . 
&quot; The fact that the market made a poor reception tells us that the market has factored in the best of all worlds , &quot; Harrington said . 
&quot; The market is using this as an example of sell on the news .
