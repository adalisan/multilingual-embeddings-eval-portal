England scored 35 points , including five tries , without reply in the second-half to hammer Ireland by a record 46-6 margin in the Five Nations championship at Lansdowne Road on Saturday . 
it was a second successive record win for an English side who beat Scotland 41-13 in the Calcutta Cup two weeks ago and sets up a potential grand slam decider against France at Twickenham on March 1 . 
eleven points separated the teams on the hour when Ireland winger Denis Hickie was unlucky to slip on the England &apos; 22 with the line at his mercy after a good break by scrum-half Niall Hogan had opened up the visiting defence . 
it proved instead to be the signal for the England pack to assume total control and the visitors rattled up 29 points in the last 15 minutes to cap an impressive team performance . 
&quot; We &apos;re not an inferior team but just didn &apos;t do ourselves justice . 
you have to take your opportunities at this level and we didn &apos;t . 
they did , &quot; Ireland centre Maurice Field said . 
left winger Tony Underwood helped himself to two late tries while right winger Jon Sleightholme added a second-half touchdown to the one he scored in the first half . 
Scrum-half Andy Gomarsall and flanker Richard Hill also put their names on the scoresheet . 
England outside-half Paul Grayson took his personal points tally to 16 when he added two conversions to the four penalties he landed earlier in the game . 
Ireland led 6-3 after 17 minutes of the first-half after outside-half Eric Elwood landed two penalties to one by Grayson , but they were affected by injuries to Elwood and number eight Eric Miller and seldom looked capable of breaking down a well drilled England defence . 
after Sleightholme went over in the right corner for a try in the 19th minute , Field having failed to find touch , England were seldom in trouble and their late onslaught was even more impressive than the one they inflicted on the Scots . 
the previous highest English win over Ireland was 38-9 at Twickenham in 1992 . 
their biggest previous success in Dublin was 36-14 back in 1938 .
