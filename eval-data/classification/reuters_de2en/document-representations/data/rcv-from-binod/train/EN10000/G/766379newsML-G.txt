fourteen people were killed in a crowded Jewish market in Jerusalem on Wednesday in a twin suicide bombing by Moslem militants that threatened to derail efforts to relaunch the Middle East peace process . 
the blasts , the deadliest in Israel since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won election last year on a pledge to bolster security , ripped through the Mahane Yehuda market in the heart of the city as lunchtime shoppers flocked to stalls . 
the Islamic militant movement Hamas , responsible for several similar attacks in the past , claimed the latest killings in a leaflet which demanded that Israel release all Palestinian prisoners held in its jails by Sunday night . 
the leaflet , faxed to an international news agency , put jailed Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin at the top of the list . 
Israeli police said the bombers , who were among the dead , strolled into the market dressed in jackets and ties with 10-kilo ( 22-pound ) bombs hidden in attache cases . 
police put the number of wounded at some 170 . 
&quot; There were two large explosions and then I saw body parts flying in the air . 
there was a big fireball right in my face , &quot; one witness said . 
the killings came on the eve of a planned visit to the region by U.S. envoy Dennis Ross with proposals for ending four months of deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks . 
the White House said it was postponing the trip to allow Israel to mourn its dead as both President Bill Clinton and Netanyahu piled pressure on Arafat to crack down on Hamas and other anti-Israeli Moslem militant groups . 
&quot; One thing is clear . 
there cannot be a situation where there is a diplomatic process and discussions about a diplomatic process when the Palestinian Authority doesn &apos;t fight terrorism , &quot; Netanyahu &apos;s senior aide Danny Naveh told Israeli television . 
Clinton , who called the bombings &quot; barbarous &quot; , said the carnage was &quot; aimed directly at innocent Israelis and , make no mistake , it was also aimed at the majority of Israelis , Palestinians and Arabs who want a lasting and just peace &quot; . 
&quot; The only answer can and must be concrete steps by the Palestinian Authority to increase security operations and the strengthening of security cooperation between Palestinians and Israelis , &quot; he told a White House news conference . 
Arafat condemned the killings as an attack &quot; against the peace process , against the Palestinians , and against the Israelis &quot; and told Reuters he was urging Netanyahu not to give up on the search for peace . 
&quot; We will do our ( best ) to face these terrorist activities as we have done in the past and will do in the future , &quot; he said . 
a senior Palestinian security official said arrests of activists from Hamas , Islamic Jihad and other extremist groups had already begun in Palestinian self-rule areas . 
Netanyahu earlier rejected Arafat &apos;s telephoned condolences , telling the Palestinian leader that sorrow would not suffice . 
Netanyahu said 150 leaders of the Moslem militant groups had in the past been set free by the Palestinian Authority &quot; like savage animals to prowl in our streets &quot; . 
&quot; We aren &apos;t ready to accept that murderous acts will be part of our daily lives every few weeks and months and we will await suitable steps , &quot; he told reporters after visiting wounded in hospital . 
the near-simultaneous explosions , about 40 metres ( yards ) apart , brought the worst death toll in the Jewish state since a spate of Moslem militant suicide bombings in February and March 1996 killed 59 people . 
the Israeli army said it had responded by sealing off the West Bank and Gaza Strip and barring Palestinians from leaving their home locations . 
Netanyahu &apos;s security cabinet also met in crisis session to consider additional steps . 
the last big bombing to rock Israel , on March 21 , killed three Israeli women along with the Palestinian Hamas bomber , and wounded 42 people at an outdoor cafe in Tel Aviv . 
that attack happened three days after Israel broke ground on a Jewish settlement on a hilltop in Arab East Jerusalem known to Israelis as Har Homa and to Palestinians as Jabal Abu Ghneim . 
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been in crisis since then , with Arafat insisting negotiations on a final peace agreement cannot take place until settlement activity stops . 
Israel has countered that the Palestinian Authority must control militants . 
it now accuses it of actively promoting violence . 
Wednesday &apos;s Hamas claim said the bombings had been carried out by the &quot; Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades martyrs unit for emancipation of prisoners &quot; . 
Hamas sources said the suicide bombers came from the West Bank and staged the attack to avenge a Jewish woman &apos;s pasting of posters depicting the Moslem Prophet Mohammad as a pig on storefronts in the West Bank town of Hebron last month . 
they said it also was in retaliation for the publication in an Israeli science magazine of a photomontage of the Virgin Mary with a cow &apos;s head . 
the photo , to illustrate a story on cloning , angered Palestinian Christians . 
the leaflet demanded the immediate release of Sheikh Yassin , the Hamas spiritual leader arrested by Israel in May 1989 , and all other Palestinian prisoners , including those from Hamas . 
&quot; The time to carry out our just demands starts from the date of this leaflet and ends at 9 o &apos;clock on Sunday evening , August 3 , &quot; it said without elaborating .
