low and high sulphur vacuum gas oil prices were firmer with crude and product futures in Europe on Wednesday but trade was thin , traders said . 
several trade houses were heard offering low sulphur product with one U.S. player said offering a cargo out of Spain at what some traders said was an optimistic $ 152 CIF NWE . 
traders said the firmer levels restricted transatlantic arbitrage trade and there was very little buying interest in Europe . 
high sulphur barge sellers pegged offers around $ 136 after trade around this level earlier in the week . 
cargo talk was thin .
