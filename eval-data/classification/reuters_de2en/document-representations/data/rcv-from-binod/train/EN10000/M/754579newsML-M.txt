Belgian shares slipped from record levels on Thursday as leading European markets all lost ground . 
Belgian traders said the profit taking was natural ahead of the end of the two-week forward market account on Friday , but were mixed on what the future held . 
the market would likely be driven from next week by the first-half earnings season , due to start July 30 with results from chemicals giant UCB . 
volatility in UCB &apos;s stock ahead of the results was partly to blame for Thursday &apos;s fall in Brussels Bel-20 , one trader said . 
the Index ended down 19.98 points , or 0.77 percent , at 2,581.58 points . 
&quot; The problem for the Brussels market is that it is more and more influenced by the evolution in UCB , which accounts for around 11 or 12 percent of the Bel-20 &apos;s weight , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; This problem will only grow in the coming months . 
movement in Belgium &apos;s major holdings also stood out on Thursday , with SGB putting on a late spurt to end 2.16 percent higher at 3,780 francs , and GBL slipping 2.62 percent to 5,950 francs . 
dealers were unaware of any reason for SGB &apos;s rise , but most of its main units were also firmer , with Union Miniere up 1.66 percent at 3,370 francs , Tractebel up 50 francs at 15,100 francs and Finoutremer up 2.56 percent at 4,800 francs . 
one trader said GBL was probably weighed down by recent underperformance by its main Electrafina unit . 
Electrafina rose five francs to 3,655 francs on Thursday , but its discount to net asset value has widened recently to nearly 30 percent , he said . 
Electrafina was probably a buy if one was prepared to gamble ahead of the August release of results by its main holding , PetroFina , he added .
