London Metal Exchange ( LME ) copper prices should remain firm for the rest of this year and look set to gain further ground over the five years , the chairman of BZW metals and Energy Group said on Monday . 
&quot; If China emerges as a large buyer at some stage in the second half of this year and if in fact real consumption carries on , I see no reason why prices should not be firm in the months to come , &quot; chairman Christopher Green told Reuters at a meeting in Singapore partly organised by the copper Development Centre . 
&quot; It very much depends on how China behaves in the second half of this year , &quot; Green said . 
reports have been swirling in the market that China has been selling copper to take advantage of prices on the LME , where the red metal recently hit a 13-month high above US $ 2,600 a tonne . 
Green told delegates at the conference the &quot; dramatic expansion in infrastructure demand &quot; and a whole new generation of products containing copper in electronics and computers will underpin copper prices for up to the next five years . 
&quot; The so-called &apos; Tiger economies &apos; of Southeast Asia were in the forefront of this expansion , &quot; he added . 
&quot; I think we can safely reckon that world copper demand is now rising at a rate in excess of four percent per annum as opposed to the historical two or 2.5 percent , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I see no reason to suppose that these rates of annual consumption will lessen over the coming years . 
indeed , they may well accelerate . 
&quot; The producers are going to enjoy prices that will be substantially over US $ 1 a pound , &quot; Green said . 
much of the growth will also be fuelled by the expanding economy of China and to a lesser extent , India . 
there are also signs that countries in the former Soviet Union are beginning to recover from their previous economic slumps .
