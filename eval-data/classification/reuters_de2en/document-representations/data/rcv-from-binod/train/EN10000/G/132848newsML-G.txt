Galatasaray have asked FIFA to authorise Romania midfielder Iulian Filipescu &apos;s transfer from Steaua Bucharest despite the Romanian champions accusing the Turks of illegally poaching the player . 
Filipescu signed for Galatasaray last week and was presented to local reporters and fans when he arrived in Turkey . 
but Steaua claim the $ 3.0 million deal is invalid as their officials were excluded from the transfer negotiations . 
Steaua have returned the first instalment of the fee -- $ 800,000 -- and say they want Filipescu back . 
but in a letter Galatasaray wrote to FIFA general secretary Sepp Blatter on Monday and made available to Reuters on Tuesday , Galatasaray claim the deal is valid and have asked FIFA to issue the player &apos;s international clearance certificate releasing him to play for them . 
&quot; Having paid the officially registered fee of $ 800,000 to Steaua Bucharest , we kindly ask ... for the release certificate of the player in order for him to play with our team immediately , &quot; said the letter , dated October 21 . 
the letter adds : &quot; Unfortunately , our efforts to find a fair solution were in vain . 
our club , having the consent of Iulian Filipescu , used the &apos; release clause &apos; and transferred $ 800,000 to Steaua Bucharest on October 17 , 1996 , for his release . 
we assume the above mentioned details all conform with FIFA rules and regulations , &quot; it states . 
Galatasaray say they met with Steaua executives twice during the negotiations , and even offered extra money and to play a friendly as part of the deal . 
they have also paid most of the transfer fee for a second player , forward Adrian Ilie . 
if Filipescu does join Galatasray he would become the club &apos;s third Romanian as international skipper Gheorge Hagi also plays for them . 
Filipescu &apos;s agent Ioan Becali said his client , who has a contract from Steuau until 1999 , was free to move providing Galatasaray paid the initial sum in his first year with his new club , plus $ 1.0 million in the second year and $ 1.2 million in the third . 
Steaua say Filipescu is still contracted to them and have written to Galatasaray demanding his return , saying he faces a ban unless he does so . 
Galatasaray chairman , Faruk Suren , is expected to travel to Bucharest this week to try and resolve the problem . 
Galtasaray scored an unexpected 4-2 victory over holders Paris St Germain in the European Cup Winners &apos; Cup last week and are keen to have Filipescu to bolster their league campaign . 
Filipescu meanwhile made what could be his last appearance for Steaua in their 1-0 European Cup Champions &apos; League victory over Widzew Lodz of Poland last week .
