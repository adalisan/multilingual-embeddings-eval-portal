a U.S. army officer leading a training operation for Mozambican soldiers said in Maputo on Tuesday that there were no problems between men who had fought on opposite sides in Mozambique &apos;s 16-year civil war . 
captain Richard Orman of the U.S. Special Forces Group ( airborne ) was speaking at a news conference as the two-month training exercise at Boane barracks on the outskirts of the capital Maputo neared its half-way mark . 
as part of a peace agreement reached between the Mozambican government and right-wing rebels of the Renamo movement in 1992 , the two armies were integrated into a force of about 11,000 men . 
asked if he had noticed bad relations between men of former rival armies , Orman said : &quot; Absolutely and completely not . 
he said the men , once bitter enemies , had not even given him reason to know who had been with which force . 
there are 12 men in the U.S. team and 135 Mozambicans , ranging in rank from private to captain . 
&quot; The motivation has been high since I came here and the training has been outstanding , &quot; said Orman .
