* The headline year-on-year rate of RPI , at 2.9 percent , was the highest since January 1996 . 
* * The 5.0 percent rise in monthly seasonal food prices was the first rise in a June since 1991 and the largest June rise since 1978 . 
for housing , the annual rate of 6.0 percent was the highest since September 1995 . 
the annual rate of household goods prices was the lowest since February 1997 and was last lower in October 1994 . 
the ons said the increase in the all items 12-month rate was largely due to rises in housing costs . 
other significant upward pressures came from seasonal food prices and motoring costs . 
there were , however , significant downward effects from alcoholic drinks &apos; prices and fuel and light prices . 
smaller downward pressures came from household goods and clothing and footwear . 
for clothing and footwear , the start of some early summer sales outweighed continuing increases as new stock entered the shops . 
Childrens &apos; clothing , in particular , showed a sharp price fall over the month . 
for household goods , furniture prices failed to rise as sharply as they did in June last year and electrical appliance prices fell more in price last month than they did in June 1996 .
