Boris Yeltsin will fly to the Helsinki summit on Thursday on a brand-new presidential plane , part of a gradual style transformation undergone by the Kremlin team since the days of the Cold War . 
the plane , based on the Russian Ilyushin-96 , cost around $ 70 million to build , according to Russian media reports . 
built and equipped in Russia , it was furnished in Switzerland in a indication of how Moscow has taken to things western after 70 years of insistence that Soviet was best . 
it has been specially fitted out for the Kremlin , with on board bedroom , meeting room and medical complex and equipment allowing Yeltsin to keep Russia &apos;s nuclear button close by , even in the air , the reports said . 
the new plane , whose construction was delayed the financial problems which have dogged Russia since communism collapsed , is part of a Kremlin makeover evident in the slick style of the Russian officials on the ground in Helsinki . 
mobile phones are in , brown nylon suits are definitely out . 
&quot; Our country lived for many years under the impression that it is permissible to go to an official function in a light coloured suit , that mineral water can be replaced by tap water . 
all this is in the past now , &quot; presidential business affairs manager Pavel Borodin told a rare news conference in Moscow . 
Twitching aside the official veil on the workings of the Kremlin , Borodin said his job covered everything , right down to the minutiae . 
&quot; We even buy door handles , &quot; he said last week . 
&quot; We provide motor cars , receive guests , pour them tea , tie their shoe laces , make hats . 
we do everything that is required of us by protocol . 
in a sign national pride still played a role , Valery Kulikov , running the Helsinki summit &apos;s press operation , said on Wednesday Yeltsin would travel around the Finnish capital in a Russian-made Zil flown in specially . 
but Borodin made no excuses about top officials often using foreign-made cars in Moscow . 
&quot; I see some of you wearing Pierre Cardin and Versace and Valentino neckties , &quot; he told the assembled reporters . 
&quot; This is not only attractive , but these neckties wear longer and look better than the produce of the Krasny Oktyabr ( Red October ) factory , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We are not wealthy enough to buy cheap things , as the known expression has it , &quot; said Borodin , adding that of the 700 new Russian cars he bought for the Kremlin and ministers each year , 200 broke down immediately and 300 more in a matter of weeks . 
he did not stop there . 
announcing plans to try to make the Russian parliament more like the U.S. Congress , he extended his crticism to Russian officials , saying they might be partly to blame for Russians &apos; economic struggles . 
&quot; Perhaps , we live such a poor life because we have very few intelligent public servants and because they haven &apos;t been provided with proper working conditions , &quot; he said . 
but he denied Yeltsin was grabbing all the resources for himself . 
&quot; The Yeltsin family lives very modestly , &quot; he said . 
&quot; They don &apos;t have a jacuzzi with gold taps .
