Sudan denied on Tuesday that Iran was providing it with military support in Khartoum &apos;s fight against rebels . 
the official Sudan news agency SUNA quoted Culture and Information Minister Al-Tayeb Ibrahim Mohamed Khair as describing the allegations by the Sudanese opposition as &quot; sheer lies and fabrications &quot; . 
he said Sudan was committed to Iran &apos;s initiative to reconcile Sudan and Uganda , and that preparations had been made for the three states to meet in Uganda &apos;s capital next month . 
Khair was responding to a statement from the Sudanese opposition group National Democratic Alliance in Cairo on Sunday , saying that Iran and Qatar were supplying the Islamist Sudanese government with military equipment , expertise and money in its fight against rebel forces . 
&quot; More than 25 Iranian military technicians and experts arrived into the Wadi Sidna military base in Omdurman ( Sudan ) , &quot; said the statement , signed by NDA spokesman Mubarak el-Mahdi . 
Sudanese opposition forces , bent on toppling the Islamist government of Khartoum , launched just over a month ago an offensive across Sudan &apos;s eastern and southern borders . 
Sudan has accused Ethiopia , Eritrea and Uganda of supporting the rebel offensive . 
the three countries deny any involvement in the conflict and the rebels say that they alone are waging the offensive . 
Sudanese media reported on Tuesday that Sudan has captured three Eritrean and Ethiopian spies .
