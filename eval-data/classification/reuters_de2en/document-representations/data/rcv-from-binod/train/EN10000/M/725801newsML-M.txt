currency turmoil in the world &apos;s three biggest natural rubber producers -- Thailand , Indonesia and Malaysia -- hit the Thai rubber market , traders said on Monday . 
although confidence was renewed by a possibility that the International Natural Rubber Organisation ( INRO ) might step in to prop up prices soon , activities on Monday were subdued as buyers and sellers were reluctant to trade , awaiting forex stability . 
&quot; There were some high offers in the market and some short covering but the overall market was quiet , &quot; said a Bangkok-based trader . 
&quot; Traders checked exchange rates all day on market talk that the central bank intervened to support the baht today , &quot; he said . 
another hat Yai trader said trade in other major markets in the region were also modest due to currency volatility . 
the Thai baht , which was floated recently , faced another bout of jitters on spillover from the de facto Philippine peso devaluation on Friday , and sank to a another record low of 30.75-30.80 per dollar until the central bank intervened . 
&quot; The baht was about to find its feet after devaluation but then the peso caused turbulence again and that affected trade , &quot; the hat Yai trader said . 
the Malaysian ringgit was also hit as was the Indonesian rupiah which fluctuated widely .
