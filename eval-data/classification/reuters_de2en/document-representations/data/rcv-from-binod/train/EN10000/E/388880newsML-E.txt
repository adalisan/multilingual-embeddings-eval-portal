Egyptian non-oil exports declined in the first nine months of 1996 and a sharp rise in imports pushed up the trade deficit despite an increase in the value of oil exports , according to figures available on Wednesday . 
the figures provide little comfort to the Egyptian government , which for years has set its heart on redirecting the economy towards exportation , away from import substitution . 
but Egypt historically runs a large deficit in visible trade and makes up the difference through remittances , tourism and other service earnings such as Suez Canal tolls . 
the figures , issued by CAPMAS ( the Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics ) , said non-oil exports in the January-September period were worth 5.133 billion pounds ( $ 1.51 billion ) , against 6.185 billion in the last period of 1995 . 
exports of crude oil and petroleum products rose to 4.269 billion pounds from 3.280 billion , they added . 
but the value of imports continued to grow rapidly , to 32.401 billion from 28.659 billion . 
this produced a trade deficit of 22.998 billion , against 19.193 billion in January-September 1995 , the figures showed . 
the same trends appeared in the figures for the July-September quarter of 1996 , compared with the same quarter of 1995 . 
Central Bank figures for the second quarter of 1996 are denominated in dollars and not strictly comparable . 
here are the latest figures in tabular form ( all figures in billions of Egyptian pounds ) : 
imports 32.401 28.659 
exports 9.403 9.466 
oil and products 4.269 3.280 
trade deficit 22.998 19.193 
imports 10.829 10.293 
exports 3.056 2.626 
oil and products 1.558 1.005 
trade deficit 7.773 7.668
