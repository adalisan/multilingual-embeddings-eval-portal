the clock at Russian Mission Control ticks towards zero and the deputy flight director talks faster with the Mir space station , cramming in important information about repairing the crippled craft . 
&quot; We &apos;re approaching the end of the window , &quot; Sergei Kirkalyov says as the voice from his partner in space starts to crackle and then quickly disappears . 
communications between Earth and Mir have become vital since the 11-year-old space station collided with its resupply craft on June 25 . 
but the space station , shown as a white dot on a large map dominating the wall of Mission Control , skirts in and out of radio reach as it orbits the Earth . 
the cosmonatus typically have continuous communications from nine to 35 minutes at a time , said Russian space spokeswoman Vera Medvedkova . 
when the space station first went into orbit 11 years ago , it was in contact for longer periods , but the cash-starved Russian space programme has cut back on some of its ground-receiving stations . 
by contrast , the American shuttle has constant contact with Earth when it orbits , said NASA spokeswoman Kathleen Maliga . 
for the Russians , every minute is precious . 
Russian space officials , many of whom are former cosmonauts , are trying to come up with ways to repair the damaged Mir , which lost about half its power in the accident , and have important things to tell the crew of two Russians and a British-American . 
on Monday , Krikalyov -- who in 1991 joined Mir as a Soviet citizen and returned months later to find the USSR gone -- described the procedure for re-attaching internal cables linking up solar panels in the damaged Spektr module . 
&quot; We have worked at a swimming pool training on your operations , &quot; Krikalyov told Mir commander Vasily Tsibliyev . 
&quot; Our opinion is that it is possible to connect all cables by hand , not using special tools . 
&quot; How many connections will we link ? 
&quot; the cosmonaut asked . 
three of them are in inconvenient places , &quot; said Krikalyov , who rose from his green swivel chair and stood as he spoke into a head piece . 
&quot; It will be better if one of you does the work and the other is ready as backup . 
&quot; That &apos;s fine ... but if we enter with hoses we would meet many problems , &quot; Tsibliyev said , heard but not seen on any of the roughly 80 monitors in Mir Mission Control . 
if the Mir crew runs into problems during their repair work -- expected to take place overnight on July 17-18 -- they may have to wait as long as an hour and a half to contact Mission Control when they re-enter radio contact , Russian space officials said . 
NASA officials say the style of the Mir Mission Control in a Moscow suburb differs from its U.S. counterpart . 
the atmosphere among Russian space engineers -- some of whom wear jeans or other casual clothes -- typically eases as Mir passes out of radio contact . 
from desks in front of five rows of computer monitors they rise from their seats . 
some gossip , others admire a collection of roses on one computer , or join serious meetings outside . 
&quot; Pyotr , Pyotr , there &apos;s a call for you , &quot; one woman holding a red phone yells across the room to a colleague . 
but the largest computer monitor in the room reads &quot; US GOVT &quot; , a sign of Russia &apos;s cooperation with the American space agency NASA , which staffs a desk in Mission Control and has an astronaut aboard Mir . 
alongside the big wall map , another chart shows Mir &apos;s longevity , clicking off the number of orbits it has made -- 65,032 as of Tuesday morning -- since it was assembled in orbit in 1986 . 
the front of the hall shows a sign of changing times , with a Russian confectionery company and an American computer maker hanging advertisements . 
in the lobby , space agency workers can take advantage of some of capitalism &apos;s offerings , choosing among chandeliers offered in a small store .
