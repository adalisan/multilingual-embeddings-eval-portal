sacked legislator Sri Bintang Pamungkas and two colleagues are being held under Indonesia &apos;s subversion law because of the activities of their fledgling political party , a minister said on Thursday . 
Attorney-General Singgih said Bintang , who was ousted from parliament and convicted of defaming President Suharto , had been detained under Indonesia &apos;s controversial 1963 subversion law . 
subversion carries a maximum penalty of death . 
&quot; If we are going to use the subversion act , then I have the right to detain him for one year without extension from a judge , &quot; Singgih told reporters at his office . 
Singgih said the government will use the criminal procedures code to detain the members of the unrecognised United Democratic Party of Indonesia ( PUDI ) rather than another section of the subversion law that allows detention without trial for a year . 
the criminal procedures code requires a new detention order to be issued every three months , and signals the government &apos;s resolve to bring Bintang and his colleagues to trial this year . 
Bintang &apos;s arrest warrant , a copy of which was obtained through Bintang &apos;s family , says he has been arrested as part of an investigation into unspecified subversive actions . 
Bintang &apos;s wife Erna earlier told Reuters her husband phoned her from the Attorney-General &apos;s office late on Wednesday to tell her of his detention along with lawyer Julius Usman , PUDI secretary-general , and leading member Saleh Abdullah . 
the men had lunched with officials from the Attorney-General &apos;s office to discuss the PUDI and Bintang &apos;s EID al-Fitr greeting cards , she said . 
Bintang wrote PUDI &apos;s three-point agenda on cards sent last month to mark the end of the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan . 
the agenda calls for a boycott of the 1997 election , rejection of Suharto &apos;s re-election and the preparation for a new post-Suharto order after the 1998 presidential election . 
Bintang sent the cards , seen by Reuters , to numerous people , including vice-president try Sutrisno , armed forces headquarters , the Attorney-General and all cabinet ministers . 
&quot; He is not only being detained here because of the greeting cards but also because of his actions in PUDI . 
I don &apos;t want to explain , it &apos;s currently under investigation , &quot; Singgih said . 
Bintang &apos;s wife , who met with her husband and Usman on Thursday , said both men were in good spirits and were refusing to answer questions until authorities granted their request to be represented by lawyers of their choice . 
she told reporters after the meeting that two letters written by her husband , one authorising a lawyer and one to the media , had been confiscated by officials . 
the High Court last month upheld the lower court decision last May sentencing Bintang to 34 months &apos; jail for defaming Suharto in a speech to Indonesian students in April 1995 . 
he had remained free pending a further appeal . 
Bintang and Usman said last October that they would run for the presidency and vice-presidency , even though the constitution does not recognise outside bids for the presidency . 
the post is decided every five years by an electoral college of parliament . 
Suharto has been re-elected unchallenged for six consecutive terms since 1968 , and is thought likely to run for another term next year . 
Bintang was sacked by the Moslem-orientated United Development Party ( PPP ) in 1995 for being too outspoken . 
the decision was subsequently approved by Suharto .
