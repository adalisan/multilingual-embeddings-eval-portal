investors willing to ride out the volatility caused by the surprise left-wing victory in French elections , will find buying opportunities at the short end of the French debt curve , analysts said on Monday . 
market concern that a left-wing win will lead to a delay in the starting date of a single European currency , has led to some weakness in both short dated paper and the currency , they said . 
but this was overdone , analysts said . 
&quot; I remain optimistic on EMU despite what clearly is a small set back for the cause , &quot; said European economist Adrian Owens . 
&quot; Certainly this election result increases the probability of a delay and as a result we are seeing some turbulence and weakness at the short end and in the currency , &quot; said Owens at Julius Baer Investments in London . 
&quot; But given that I still expect EMU to go ahead this probably represents fairly good buying opportunities at the shorter end of the curve . 
the final result of the election showed the Socialists , led by Lionel Jospin , and allied other-left candidates won 273 seats , the Communist Party 38 seats , the ecologists seven and the outgoing centre-right coalition and other right candidates 257 . 
Phyllis Reed , European bond strategist at BZW in London , also said investors should look at the front end of the curve . 
&quot; The longer maturities aren &apos;t really doing too much . 
the pressure is coming through at the front end , &quot; she said . 
there was the usual market concern that a new government would abandon the policy of keeping the franc strong and that the Bank of France would have to raise interest rates to defend that , she said . 
&quot; But the arguments in favour of that are much weaker than they used to be , so in the front end you are really being presented with a great buying opportunity , &quot; Reed said . 
&quot; If the franc does look to be heading towards 3.40 , we could see the two-year spread heading towards as high as 40 basis points over Germany . 
at that point we think people would be buying it . 
at 0839 GMT , the two-year French / German yield spread was at 25 basis points . 
Reed said on a three- to six-month view the spread should be in single digits . 
Owens said there would also be a premium for investors in terms of the interest rate differential as the currency was likely to be set at a central rate and French interest rates were slightly higher . 
&quot; The currency should , if we are going to have EMU on time , be trading below the central rate , so there is value in francs , &quot; he said . 
June Pibor futures were at 96.28 , down 0.08 on the day . 
the franc was trading at 3.3838 / 40 marks , against central ERM parity of 3.3539 marks . 
the left-wing victory in itself would not provoke worries because of the Socialist commitment to the idea of a single currency , said Reed . 
&quot; The real problem will come if and when we see Jospin pressing for some of his more controversial demands , &quot; she said . 
Jospin has been calling for a renegotiation of the stability pact and negotiations to set up a political counterweight to the European Central Bank . 
&quot; It is all quite tough talk that indicates there is scope for tensions to build up between the French and the Germans , and that is the point at which we have to start getting worried about the single currency , &quot; said Reed , adding there was a chance this had just been electioneering on Jospin &apos;s part . 
but Julian Jessop , European economist at Nikko Europe in London , said given the uncertainties surrounding Europe he would look to get out of European debt markets .
