the stock led trade , closing up 12.45 bolivars at 532.50 , and boosting the Bolsa &apos;s index by 2.10 percent to end at 6,132.04 points . 
the company had suspended dividends for most of 1996 due to government delays in approving rate increases .

&quot; The stock was already rising before the news , but then it took off -- despite generally low volume , &quot; said one trader . 
despite the rise , Caracas stocks do not look set to build up momentum . 
&quot; There &apos;s still no force to the market , neither up nor down , &quot; said Interacciones broker Eduardo Fortuni .
