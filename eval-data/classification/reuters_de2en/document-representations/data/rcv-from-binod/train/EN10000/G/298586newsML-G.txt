&quot; You &apos;re speaking with a forked tongue . 
&quot; You &apos;ve been exposed for your duplicity . 
&quot; You &apos;re an unscrupulous S.O.B. 
&quot; You &apos;re trying to back stab me . 
&quot; You are a racist . 
&quot; We know that you &apos;re Satan . 
just another conference call in that wonderful world of professional boxing with promoter Don King at his dramatic , irate best . 
not unusually bombastic , mind you , but fully cranked up , as he ranted against promoter Dino Duva of Main Events on Thursday . 
Duva &apos;s strongest response to King was that it was all &quot; bullshit &quot; which drew a rebuke from King &apos;s heavyweight fighter , Oliver McCall , to watch his language . 
and later , a plea from the fighter : &quot; Can &apos;t we all get along ? 
King and Duva have been forced into a shotgun wedding for the promotion of the Lennox Lewis-McCall fight for the vacant World Boxing Council ( WBC ) title scheduled , but not at all certain to come off between the two 31-year-old fighters , on Feb 7 in Las Vegas . 
the subject of the rancour , of course , is money . 
King says Duva has not provided a letter of credit for the $ 3.75 million King says McCall is due for his equal split with Lewis of the purse for the fight . 
and King says his man will not fight if the money isn &apos;t forthcoming . 
Duva , meanwhile , says he will provide the money only when he receives a properly-notarized letter , informing him whether to give the money to McCall or to King . 
Duva , who won the right to promote the fight in a purse bid , says King sent him an improperly notarized letter that would not hold up legally . 
what &apos;s more , King says , Duva has not provided $ 200,000 in training expenses for McCall , the former WBC heavyweight champion by way of his upset second-round knockout of Lewis in 1994 . 
Duva says he &apos;s not obligated to pay training expenses for King &apos;s fighter , who lost his title to Frank Bruno 16 months ago . 
Bruno subsequently lost it to Tyson last March , who then lost it to Evander Holyfield in November . 
King says McCall , who assures everyone his third rehabilitation programme for drug and alcohol abuse is taking , needs the training expenses also to help him feed &quot; his six babies . 
McCall , arrested last month on charges of vandalism , disorderly conduct and resisting arrest after he threw a Christmas tree in a hotel lobby , says the money also would pay for bigger and taller sparring partners . 
but , regardless , said McCall ( 28-6 ) in his best Muhammad Ali imitation , &quot; I guarantee you within fo-ahh he &apos;s gonna hit the flo-ahh . 
McCall , who says he &apos;s &quot; walking in righteousness &quot; these days , said of the advice Lewis ( 29-1 ) will receive from a new , improved corner , &quot; You can tell him how to fight , but you can &apos;t put the fight in him . 
but McCall , attempting to show his new-found stability , helped by seeing drug counsellors every day and having &quot; people surround me 24 hours , &quot; said , &quot; If the fight don &apos;t never happen I will not shed a tear . 
&quot; My greatest goal is not to be champion again , my goal is to enter the kingdom of heaven .
