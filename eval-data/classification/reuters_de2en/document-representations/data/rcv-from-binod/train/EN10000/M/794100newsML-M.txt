CBOT soft red winter wheat futures closed lower in a bearish reaction to USDA &apos;s hike in its 1997 U.S. wheat production forecast and on an increase by the government in its forecast for 1997-98 production and ending stocks of foreign wheat , traders said . 
&quot; There were two surprises in wheat . 
the U.S production as high as it was but the increase in China and FSU were so good that it increased the foreign ending stocks , &quot; said Smith Barney analyst Dale Gustafson . 
USDA said 1997 U.S. wheat production totalled 2.531 billion bushels , above USDA &apos;s July forecast for 2.431 billion and above the average analysts &apos; estimate for 2.476 billion . 
also USDA Tuesday pegged 1997-98 foreign ending stocks of wheat at 105.57 million tonnes , above the government &apos;s estimate in July for 102.37 million tonnes . 
USDA cut its production forecast for Argentina , Australia and Canada but sharply boosted its outlook for China and the FSU-12 &apos;s wheat production for 1997-98 . 
however , declines in wheat were curbed by a limit gain in corn futures . 
wheat closed three cents per bushel lower to 1 / 4 higher , with September down 2-3 / 4 at $ 3.61 a bushel . 
wheat bulls also may have taken note of news Tuesday that Jordan bought 50,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat and news the USDA Tuesday trimmed its forecast of 1997-98 U.S. wheat imports amid concerns over rising shipments from Canada . 
USDA in its supply / demand report Tuesday forecast 1997-98 U.S. wheat , wheat flour and product imports at 2.59 million tonnes , down from the government &apos;s estimate in July for 2.72 million . 
nearly all U.S. wheat imports come from Canada and recently there has been friction between the two countries tied to wheat sales . 
but the lower U.S. wheat import forecast reflects revised outlooks for both the U.S. and Canadian wheat crop . 
FIMAT futures bought two million bushels of December as did prudential Securities , traders said . 
Rosenthal Collins bought 4.5 million bushels of December , traders said . 
late local selling drove wheat futures lower on the day plus Cargill Inc sold one million September and Cargill Inc sold one million bushels of December , traders said . 
in spread dealings , Rand Financial did 2.5 million bushels of December / September at 15-3 / 4 to 16 cents , premium December , and Farmers commodities Corp spread from one half million to one million bushels of December / September , traders said . 
term commodities did five million bushels of September / December at 15 cents , premium December , FIMAT futures did two million December / September at 15-1 / 4 cents , and Goldenberg Hehmeyer did one million March / September at 25-1 / 2 cents , premium March , sources said . 
wheat futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 30,000 contracts , above the 20,674 traded Monday . 
in wheat options , LFG futures sold 200 December $ 4.10 calls at 10-1 / 4 cents , Paine Webber bought 100 December $ 3.60 puts at 8-3 / 4 cents and sold 100 December $ 3.50 puts at six cents , traders said . 
wheat options volume was estimated at 4,000 contracts , above the 3,835 traded Monday .
