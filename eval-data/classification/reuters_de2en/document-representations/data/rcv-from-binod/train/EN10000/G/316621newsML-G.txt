Wales set up a potentially rewarding Five Nations championship campaign with a startling 34-19 win over Scotland on Saturday , their first at Murrayfield since 1985 . 
the highest Welsh score on Scottish soil looked out of the question when they trailed 16-10 early in the second-half but three tries in the space of five minutes transformed the game and their entire season . 
those try-scoring efforts of Neil Jenkins , Arwel Thomas and Ieuan Evans will give the Scottish defence nightmares every time they watch the video of an error-strewn match the home side seemed to have securely in the bag . 
the turnaround also owed much to former rugby league men Scott Quinnell , who scored the first of his side &apos;s four tries and Scott Gibbs who look certain to be the rocks around which the British Isles side to South Africa will be based . 
Neil Jenkins also became only the fifth player to top 500 points in test rugby but , apart from that devastating five-minute spell , the Welsh still have to prove they can bother the likes of England and France . 
the first half hour had been dreadful until the missing spark was provided by Gregor Townsend , a superb flick pass under heavy pressure sending Scott Hastings over for a try on the left to reward a sustained Scottish forward drive . 
the home side &apos;s lead lasted just seven minutes when Wales struck back with an equally striking try of their own . 
a curving run and clever dummy from centre Allan Bateman took the ball into Scotland &apos;s 22 and his partner Gibbs was at his elbow to supply Quinnell with the scoring pass . 
test rugby is short on examples of a Scott scoring against the Scots and the Welsh looked dangerous every time he had the ball in his hands . 
but it was Scotland who led at half-time , courtesy of a drop-goal from Craig Chalmers , and a second penalty from shepherd five minutes into the second-half put them 16-10 ahead . 
then it all went unbelievably , irretrievably wrong . 
Jenkins cut in from the left to score the first Five Nations try by a Welsh full-back for more than a decade and three minutes later Thomas reacted quickest when an up-and-under went loose 40 metres out . 
he sprinted clear of Hastings &apos; desperate tackle and looked intent on running clear out of the stadium before dotting the ball down right on the edge of the in-goal area . 
Evans , who had never scored a try or finished on the winning side at Murrayfield , then added the 31st of his long career when another kick ahead bounced loose and there was only one winner from that moment on .
