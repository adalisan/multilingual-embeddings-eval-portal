the Australian Senate , the upper house of parliament , on Thursday condemned Nigerian human rights and environmental abuses and urged the African nation be expelled from the Commonwealth if it failed to improve . 
the Senate , where the government is in a minority , urged Australia to push for Nigeria &apos;s expulsion at a meeting of Commonwealth government heads in Britain this year . 
the government opposed the independent motion which censured Nigeria &apos;s military regime for its &quot; gross abuses of human rights &quot; and the &quot; environmental damage &quot; it was causing . 
the government , in an unsuccessful rival move , said calls for Nigeria &apos;s expulsion from the Commonwealth were premature . 
Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth of former British colonies in 1995 after it executed nine minority rights activists in defiance of world opinion . 
Britain earlier this month said sanctions should be imposed if Nigeria failed to make democratic reforms , but the Commonwealth is divided over how to react to the oil-rich West African nation over allegations of human rights abuses .
