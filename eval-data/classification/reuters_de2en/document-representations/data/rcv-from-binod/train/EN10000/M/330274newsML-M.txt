Argentine bonds slumped Friday as the market stumbled in volatile activity on profit taking after a week of strong gains . 
&quot; It was negative all day , &quot; said a trader at a local bank . 
this session &apos;s profit taking came after the market had risen virtually all of January and with a decline in U.S. treasuries which pushed the 30-year yield above 6.90 percent . 
the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 fell $ 0.47 to 125.28 while the FRB Brady bond due 2005 fell 3 / 4 to 88-3 / 4 . 
earlier in the week , the market had been boosted by Argentina &apos;s $ 2.0 billion , 20-year global bond which was placed at a spread of 462.5 basis points over comparable U.S. treasuries . 
with the bond , the government has already raised $ 4.0 billion of the total $ 8.5 billion it said it will issue this year to cover 1997 spending needs . 
but with that issue well out of the way &quot; I can see more volatility in coming days , &quot; said another trader . 
&quot; And the volatility will lead to caution . 
but , &quot; the market &apos;s fundamentals haven &apos;t changed , &quot; said the first trader , promising that the market is set to regain its upward momentum again at some point . 
in the money markets , call money rates fell to 5.50 percent from 5.65 percent .
