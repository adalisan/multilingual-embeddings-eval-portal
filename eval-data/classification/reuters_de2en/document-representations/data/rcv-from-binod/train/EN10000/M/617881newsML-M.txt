German Bunds and futures deepened their losses in late trade on Tuesday , heading for a weak close to an uncomfortable session . 
analysts said the market was being dogged by fresh EMU concerns after the first round of French elections produced a swing to the political left at the weekend , opening up the prospect of a less strict interpretation on EMU entry rules . 
after Bunds wobbled in the first half of the session , struggling to limit losses to two or three basis points , a downbeat start to U.S. treasuries trade confirmed a downside move . 
strong U.S. consumer confidence data later added to the market &apos;s woes . 
by 1408 GMT the June DTB contract was trading six basis points lower on the day at 100.65 , having dipped to a low at 100.55 earlier in the session . 
&quot; EMU is really the big issue for this market at the moment , but I expect things will remain very much the same until we get a final result from French elections next week , &quot; said one Frankfurt-based trader . 
&quot; That outcome could have a very important impact for Bunds and the French market . 
France is due to go to the polls for a second round on Sunday . 
at home , deficit worries continued to haunt Bunds as Bundesbank council member Guntram Palm said talk of a revalution of old reserves and the sale of the government &apos;s shares in Deutsche Telekom could damage confidence in the euro . 
the Bundesbank is due to meet for its fortnightly council meeting on Wednesday -- one day early because of a public holiday on Thursday -- and is expected to be presented with draft plans by the German government on the revaluation . 
but it is unclear whether any offical statement will be made .
