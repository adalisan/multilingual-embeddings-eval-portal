underdog India took a 2-1 lead against the Czech Republic in their Davis Cup World Group first round tie on Saturday , as a last minute switch by captain Vladislav Savrda failed to pay dividends . 
Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi won a hard fought 7-6 6-3 6-4 victory over the Czech pair of Petr Korda and Martin Damm , giving the unranked Indians the upper hand heading into Sunday &apos;s reverse singles . 
just as he had done before the quarterfinal and semifinal doubles matches in last year &apos;s tournament , Savrda , plumping for experience , inserted Korda into the line-up an hour before the play , denying Pavel Vizner his first taste of Davis Cup experience . 
but while Korda was able to spur the Czechs to victory last year , he was unable to make the third time a charm as the Czechs were broken in the first game of the match , never appearing to control play for more than a few points at a time . 
Olympic bronze medallist Paes helped coach Bhupathi , ranked 478 in the world through the few tough moments there were , and sent a signal to Korda that the Indians would not be intimidated by their fifth-seeded opponents . 
Paes and Korda , who square off in the first reverse singles match , hit each other several times at the net with sharply hit shots , sensing Saturday &apos;s match was little more than a prelude for the tie &apos;s key rubber on Sunday . 
the win is also a small piece of revenge for the Indian pair after Korda and Australian Pat Cash ousted them from the first round of the Australian Open doubles last month . 
&quot; In today &apos;s match what counted the most is that we went forward as a team , in the Davis Cup , that is the most important thing . 
( but ) a tough game is still ahead of me , and I know I will have to fight with all of my strength , &quot; said world number 105 Paes . 
despite the loss , Savrda said he remained optimistic of his team &apos;s chances to advance to the second round : &quot; After Friday &apos;s matches I said that the doubles would not be fun for us . 
but we still have a good chance to take both of the reverse singles matches because I think both of our players are better . 
after 33rd ranked Korda and Paes square off , Bhupathi , ranked 478 in the world , is slated to face Jiri Novak , 67th in the world .
