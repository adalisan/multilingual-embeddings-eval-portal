Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on Friday he was &quot; astounded &quot; that this year &apos;s Nobel Peace Prize had gone to East Timorese resistance leader Jose Ramos-Horta , branding him a &quot; political adventurist &quot; . 
&quot; We think he is a political adventurist , for a while representing a very small minority but ... ( now ) repudiated by the majority of the people of East Timor , &quot; he told Reuters Television on a visit to the German city of Hamburg . 
Alatas also said Ramos-Hortha could not be compared to previous winners of the prestigious prize . 
&quot; I wonder what effect it will lue of earlier Nobel Peace Prizes given to such illustrous people like Mr ( Nelson ) Mandela and Mr ( Yasser ) Arafat who have brought peace to real conflicts , &quot; he said . 
Ramos-Hortha , who lives in exile , was awarded the prize jointly with East Timor &apos;s Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo . 
Alatas did not comment on the bishop . 
&quot; He really represents no-one but himself , &quot; Alatas said of Ramos-Hortha . 
&quot; What has he really contributed to peace ? 
on the contrary , I think it is he and his group which started all the trouble for the majority of the East Timorese people .
