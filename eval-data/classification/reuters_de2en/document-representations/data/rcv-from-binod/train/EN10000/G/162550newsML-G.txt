in the waning days of the presidential campaign , Bob Dole is trying to bury an issue that has dogged him the entire campaign -- his age . 
the 73-year-old candidate is attacking with a vengeance perceptions that his age may be a handicap , campaigning around the clock with only catnaps here and there on his plane . 
he seems determined to not only go all out to try to beat President Bill Clinton but also put to rest questions whether he is fit to endure long hours in event he has to deal with a national emergency . 
dole embarked on Friday on what he called &quot; a non-stop victory tour &quot; from the Midwest to the East coast to the West coast back to his heartland home town of Russell , Kansas , to vote at noon Tuesday . 
on his plane he was asked why he came up with the fast finish . 
&quot; It &apos;s my last option . 
in all Dole said he would campaign four straight days with at least 96 hours of travelling and events with only stops for a quick shower and shave . 
in the first roughly 36 hours of this swing , Dole and aides told reporters that he had logged about 3 1 / 2 hours of sleep in all , in three spurts -- one on the leg of his plane trip from Detroit to Newark , New Jersey , on a leg from Philadelphia to Indianapolis and from Covington , Kentucky , to St. Louis . 
the whirlwind blitz is designed as a dramatic finale to his uphill struggle to beat Clinton and pull the biggest election upset since Democrat Harry Truman defeated Tom Dewey in the 1948 election . 
polls have shown that when people are asked what comes to mind about Dole , they often have replied that he is old . 
rival Clinton is 23 years younger at age 50 . 
but Dole often brags that his health is excellent , even though he has a useless right arm and shoulder from combat wounds in Italy in 1945 that nearly killed him . 
on his diet on the marathon trip , Dole said &quot; I drink a lot of liquids but not a lot of coffee . 
eat a lot of fruit . 
drink a lot of that water &quot; -- pointing to some mineral waters on a reporters &apos; table in his plane . 
dole &apos;s former long-time chief Senate aide , Sheila Burke , who now lends advice as she accompanies him on the campaign , is a registered nurse by training . 
she said that coffee , alcohol and sugar should be avoided on this type of long pace . 
&quot; They pump you up and then you crash , &quot; she said . 
&quot; He is invigorated , he is positive , he is upbeat ... not strident , &quot; said Burke who has never seen him so pumped up as he is in these last hours . 
apparently so , because Dole added more stops and states to his campaign trip Sunday , boosting his target for campaigning in the 96 hours to stops in 19 states . 
earlier he was talking about 14 or 15 states .
