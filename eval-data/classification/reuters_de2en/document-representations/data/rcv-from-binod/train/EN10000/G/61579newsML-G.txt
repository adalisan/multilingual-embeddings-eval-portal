five-year-old twin girls who were found emaciated , crawling with ants and encrusted with excrement in their California home were in slightly better condition Wednesday , a hospital spokeswoman said . 
the twins , being treated at Oakland Children &apos;s Hospital , were upgraded from critical to serious , spokeswoman Jeanette Rogers said . 
the twins &apos; mother , 26-year-old Tanya Walker , appeared in court in California &apos;s central valley town of Modesto Tuesday to be arraigned on charges of attempted murder , torture and child endangerment . 
she could face a life prison sentence if convicted , police say . 
in a trembling voice , Walker , dressed in orange prison uniform , denied the charges against her and told the judge she wanted to go home to see her family . 
twins Brittany and Breanne , who suffer from cerebral palsy , were severely malnourished , dehydrated and bruised when they were found in bunkbeds in a house in Ceres , 80 miles ( 130 kms ) east of San Francisco , on Sunday night , police said . 
a police statement said the girls were &quot; suffering from scabies , had dried stool particles around their buttocks and had ants crawling in and out of bodily orifices . 
Ceres Police Sgt. 
Allen McKay said the twins , who weighed just 14 and 19 pounds , looked like Holocaust victims and &quot; were just basically skin and bones . 
Walker was arrested on Sunday night and jailed . 
neighbours and social workers , who visited the home in April , said they had no idea of the situation . 
the girls &apos; grandparents found the twins alone , locked inside Walker &apos;s home on Sunday when they were returning two siblings from a weekend visit . 
the grandparents took the twins to a nearby hospital and police were notified . 
the twins were later flown to Oakland Children &apos;s Hospital . 
at the time the children were found , Walker had gone to pick up her infant son from a babysitter . 
Walker also has two other healthy children , the 3-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter who had been visiting the grandparents . 
the three other children were released to relatives , police said . 
Walker told police that government funding was cut off for a nutritional formula that had been prescribed for the twins . 
she tried other foods but the twins lost weight and their condition deteriorated to a point where she was afraid to seek medical help because she was concerned authorities would take her other children away from her , McKay said .
