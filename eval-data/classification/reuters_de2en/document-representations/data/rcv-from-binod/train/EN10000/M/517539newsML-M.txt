the debut of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange &apos;s latest emerging market contract , Mexican TIIE interest rate futures , saw small volume on Thursday . 
preliminary volume estimates showed Mexican Cetes futures traded 63 contracts on Thursday , compared with 83 on Wednesday . 
the CME said these debt instruments round out the exchange &apos;s Mexico portfolio traded on the Growth and Emerging Markets ( GEM ) division . 
gem traders said interest from Mexican banks was bound to perk up as the contracts become more established . 
CME economist Norman mains , in an interview Wednesday with Reuters Financial Television , noted that peso futures got off to a slow start but have steadily gained interest since their April 1995 launch . 
Mexican peso futures traded an estimated 6,568 contracts on Thursday . 
according to CME volume statistics , futures and options on Mexican par Brady bonds did not trade Wednesday , nor did futures on the Mexican IPC stock index . 
mains said the exchange was aiming for volume in Cetes and TIIE to rise to 1,000 contracts a day . 
&quot; If we could do , say , 1,000 a day after three months , we &apos;d be pleased , &quot; mains said .
