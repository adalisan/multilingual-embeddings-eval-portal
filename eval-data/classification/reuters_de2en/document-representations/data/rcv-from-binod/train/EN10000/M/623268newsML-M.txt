the Slovak crown sharply firmed after the National Bank of Slovakia ( NBS ) again fixed it stronger than market levels and dealers said the currency looked stable at its current price . 
the crown firmed some 110 basis points to around -1.90 percent versus its mark / dollar basket parity at about 1200 GMT . 
earlier on Thursday the NBS fixed the crown at 33.313 to the dollar and at 19.544 to the mark , implying a deviation against the baske of -0.67 percent . 
the crown was trading at around -3.0 percent versus the basket shortly before the fixing . 
&quot; The crown looks more or less stable at current levels , but it has yet to find its real market price , &quot; said Oto Mohnansky of Slovenska Sporitelna . 
Mohnansky said the future trend , and thus the crown &apos;s real price , would be determined by the NBS &apos; further strategy on market &apos;s crown liquidity . 
most dealers agreed that much will depend on how the NBS would react in coming days , pointing mainly to the fact that local banking sector was short of crown liquidity ahead of the end of minimum reserves period on Friday . 
according to NBS figures , the Slovak banking sector lacked 6.17 percent of required funds to meet its minimum reserves requirement . 
&quot; Based on the current situation , some banks just cannot meet their reserve requirement tommorow , so it will depend on whether the central bank will add some liquidity , &quot; said one local money market trader . 
but another Bratislava-based dealer from a foreign bank warned it would be too early for the NBS to pump crown liquidity to the market . 
&quot; They ( NBS ) still cannot say that the danger of another wave of speculative pressure will not occure , so the central bank should probably wait and keep the market short for some more days , &quot; the dealer said . 
the central bank has deliberately kept the crown money market short of liquidity to prevent speculators from obtaining funds which could be used for short-selling . 
the NBS have not carried out its regular repo tenders over the past few days , including Thursday , which radically squeezed liquidity on the money market , but appeared to have helped prevent stronger speculative pressure on the currency .
