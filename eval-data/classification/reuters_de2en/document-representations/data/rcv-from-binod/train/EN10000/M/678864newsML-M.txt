this was despite wool prices in June reaching their highest level since mid 1995 , he said . 
wool &apos;s eastern market indicator ( EMI ) jumped to 753 cents a kg , a rise of almost 40 percent since its low in October 1996 , he said . 
while the rural SDR index was down in the latest month , it was still 3.4 percent higher than at the same time last year , Ritchie said . 
in Australian dollar terms , the index rose by 1.0 percent during June , with wool prices continuing to strengthen and improved prices for sorghum , sheep meat and live cattle , he said . 
these increases were more than offset by lower wheat and beef prices , he said . 
the wool market had been buoyed by demand from overseas processors who were looking to rebuild stocks , with Japanese demand strengthening in recent weeks and more activity from Chinese and Western European customers , he said . 
wheat prices had moved lower over the past month in anticipation of an increased northern hemisphere harvest , he said . 
beef prices weakened during the month with oversupply in world markets and weak demand from the U.S. , he said . 
Dresdner chief economist Rob Henderson said non-rural SDR prices fell by 1.8 percent during June , and were currently only 0.7 percent above the level of a year ago . 
crude oil and copper prices strengthened , while nickel and aluminium prices weakened over the month . 
gold prices remained virtually steady , he said .
