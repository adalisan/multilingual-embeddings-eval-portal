the FBI has asked its legal attache in Egypt to help investigate seven letter bombs which were apparently sent from the Egyptian city of Alexandria to the United States , an FBI spokeswoman said on Friday . 
&quot; There is a legal attache in Cairo ; we &apos;ve reached out to that office and have asked that they go into Alexandria to conduct the investigation , &quot; the FBI &apos;s Susan Lloyd said by telephone . 
Lloyd said the probe into the seven devices -- four of which were found at the Washington offices of the Saudi-owned newspaper Al-Hayat , one at the Washington central post office and two more at the federal prison in Leavenworth , Kansas -- was international in scope . 
&quot; We are not only conducting the investigation in the United States , but also are reaching out to friendly foreign intelligence sources to see if they have anything that might be of interest , &quot; Lloyd said . 
she added that the FBI was reviewing debris from four devices found on Thursday at Al-Hayat &apos;s offices . 
the devices were &quot; disrupted &quot; safely by the Washington bomb squad . 
the two devices discovered at the Leavenworth prison were being shipped to the FBI &apos;s laboratory in Washington , Lloyd added .
