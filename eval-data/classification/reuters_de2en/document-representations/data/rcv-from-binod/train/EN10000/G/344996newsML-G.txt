Britain was urged by an independent body on Thursday to set up a watchdog to defuse sectarian tension during Northern Ireland &apos;s Protestant &quot; marching season . 
the Independent Review of parades and Marches , set up after clashes swept the province last summer , said a five-person &quot; parades commission , &quot; rather than the police , should decide whether marches near Catholic areas should in effect be banned . 
but the largely Protestant police would have the right of appeal if they believed public order was endangered . 
&quot; We recommend that the parades Commission keeps under review the potential difficulty of significant clashes between parades and open-air public meetings , &quot; the team said . 
&quot; We recommend that the responsibility for reaching conclusions in relation to disputed parades should in future be that of the parades Commission rather than the RUC ( police ) &quot; , the report team chaired by British academic Peter North said . 
the report was published on the 25th anniversary of Bloody Sunday when 13 Catholics on a civil rights march were shot dead by British troops in Londonderry . 
the commission said the Royal Ulster Constabulary would be empowered to appeal to the government against a commission decision and the final say about preserving order should rest with the police , the report said . 
&quot; We recommend that in the extreme circumstances of the determination of the parades Commission being defied , the police should retain the power to intervene on public order grounds as a parade is assembling or proceeding . 
Protestants deny Catholic charges of bigotry and say their annual marches show their loyality to their faith and the British Crown . 
Catholics regard them as triumphalist commemorations of 300-year-old victories over the native Irish . 
two people were killed and many injured during a summer frenzy of sectarian violence in 1996 . 
hangover effects are seen in arson attacks on churches and boycotts of Catholic and Protestant traders in some rural communities . 
the vortex of the trouble was in the town of Portadown 25 miles ( 35km ) south of Belfast . 
police banned the Orange Order from parading through a Catholic area but reversed the decision three days later after province-wide Protestant protests . 
on July 12 a large force of police and soldiers hemmed Catholics into their side-streets to allow a march of some 500 Orangemen along Belfast &apos;s Lower Ormeau Road . 
North told a press conference after his report was published : &quot; Many of those we talked to told us of their alarm at the potential consequences of the disruption last summer . 
&quot; We can only hope that , in these recommendations , people will recognise another way forward . 
parades and protests have the capability of polarising communities , as we have seen . 
leaked details of the report last week were broadly welcomed by the largely Protestant RUC , many of whom complained about being caught in the middle of opposing factions last year . 
but Jeffrey Donaldson , a leader of the Orange Order , the main pro-British marching fraternity , said a commission would become &quot; a factory of grievance &quot; . 
Catholic groups reacted cautiously . 
sources in the Catholic community said they did not expect the plans to be a panacea . 
Northern Ireland has been plagued by a series of bombings in recent weeks . 
the Irish Republican Army , seeking a united Ireland , broke its September 1994 ceasefire in February but Protestant guerrillas have held to theirs .
