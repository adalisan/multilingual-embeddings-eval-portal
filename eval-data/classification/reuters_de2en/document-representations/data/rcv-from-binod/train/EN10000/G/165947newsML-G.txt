South Africa &apos;s new abortion law passed its final legislative hurdle on Tuesday , clearing the way for President Nelson Mandela to replace one of the world &apos;s toughest abortion laws with one of the most liberal . 
the Choice on termination of pregnancy Bill , the most controversial moral question tackled by South Africa &apos;s first democratic parliament , was approved by 49 votes to 21 in the Senate . 
twenty senators were not present for the vote , including a number from the ruling African National Congress , which insisted that its members should support the bill or stay away . 
the white separatist Freedom Front , the white-led National Party and the conservative Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party opposed the measure . 
health Minister Nkosazana Zuma said after the bill was adopted by the National Assembly last week that it could be several months before the health department was able to implement the provisions of the new law . 
she said Mandela would delay signing the bill until at least some hospitals were able to cope . 
the bill will cancel an existing law allowing abortion only in the case of rape , incest or immediate danger to the mental or physical health of the mother . 
under the new law , women and girls will be entitled to a state-funded abortion on demand during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy if they have no private medical aid schemes , and , subject to widely defined conditions , for a further eight weeks . 
the new law allows underage girls and teenagers as young as 14 to have an abortion without the consent of their parents or guardians .
