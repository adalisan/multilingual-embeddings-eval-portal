Hungarian President Arpad Goncz &apos;s vetoing of two government-backed bills in two days enhances his image as a non-partisan president but could delay much-meeded anti-graft legislation , politicians and analysts said on Friday . 
on Thursday Goncz shocked the governing coalition of Socialists and Free Democrats by vetoing a conflict of interest bill which bans MPs from holding positions in companies with a state-owned stake of over 10 percent . 
he rejected the bill on the grounds that it applied only to posts taken up since the 1994 elections . 
then on Friday he threw out a set of amendments to the privatisation law which would allow the state privatisation agency APV to transfer assets free of charge to municipalities . 
&quot; This makes Goncz appear strong and answers those who thought he was a closet Free Democrat as that party was more surprised than anyone , &quot; said political analyst Attila Ledenyi . 
Goncz was a founder member of the Free Democrats before he was elected president in 1990 . 
however Ledenyi added that the conflict of interest bill , the result of a compromise between the governing Socialist Party and its junior coalition partner , the Free Democrats , could now be in real danger . 
the Socialists had wanted the new law to apply only after the next general election in 1998 while the Free Democrats wanted all existing business interests to be scrutinised . 
&quot; The 1994 threshold was an untenable resolution of their differences , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Now they really have to choose between the two . 
free Democrat MP Miklos Hanko Farago , who negotiated with the Socialists over the bill , said his party was unlikely to give any more ground . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see any way out through further talks with Socialists , &quot; he told Reuters . 
Farago said he doubted whether the Socialists would vote for the bill even if it was put to parliament unchanged . 
&quot; Last time some Socialist MPs voted against it while others supported it against their better judgement , &quot; he said . 
Zoltan Kosa , of the opposition Young Democrats expressed surprise that Goncz was prepared to risk having no conflict of interest law at all rather than allowing the compromise deal . 
&quot; This is a real Christmas present for us , &quot; he said . 
Goncz &apos;s rejection of the privatisation amendments was less surprising to observers . 
the idea that the state had the discretion to hand out real estate free of charge to local authorities in the run-up to elections in 1998 had provoked uproar among the opposition which only accounts for 28 percent of national assembly seats . 
it had threatened to take its complaints to the Constitutional Court if Goncz signed the bill . 
&quot; We saw it as legalised corruption , &quot; Kosa told Reuters . 
the government is particularly vulnerable to such criticism following a scandal in October involving $ 5 million of payments by APV to a consultant , Marta Tocsik , who was employed to negotiate with local governments over land deals . 
the revelations resulted in the sacking of the whole APV board and the resignation of Socialist Industry and Trade Minister Tamas Suchman . 
&quot; This was a clear-cut case for Goncz , &quot; said Attila Ledenyi . 
&quot; Giving discretion to a government agency to hand over assets to local authorities was simply not on . 
Dezso Avarkeszi , secretary of state at the justice ministry said he understood Goncz &apos;s decision to reject the amendments . 
&quot; This could have really sparked serious constitutional concerns , &quot; he told Reuters . 
Avarkeszi said that under the constitution , once the new bill has been passed , Goncz will be obliged to sign the bill in whatever form it appears , although any Hungarian citizen , including opposition MPs , will be entitled to challenge the law before the Constitutional Court . 
Ledenyi believes such a turn of events could endanger Goncz &apos;s increased authority . 
&quot; It could be humiliating for Goncz if it comes back unchanged , &quot; he said .
