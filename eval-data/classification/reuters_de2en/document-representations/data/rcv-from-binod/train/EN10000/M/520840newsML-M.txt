U.S. spot propane prices jumped in Mont Belvieu and edged higher in Conway near midday Friday on firmer crude prices and tighter liquids supply amid maintenance on two Texas fractionators , traders said . 
&quot; crude is stronger and there &apos;s short-covering on propane , &quot; a Texas player said , adding the fractionator shutdowns in Mont Belvieu helped &quot; create a buying spurt &quot; on the Gulf Coast . 
sources said the two adjacent units -- the 110,000 barrel-per-day Gulf Coast Fractionators unit operated by Conoco and the 105,000-bpd Mont Belvieu 1 unit run by Koch Oil -- were taken down for planned maintenance earlier this week . 
&quot; They are really brief turnarounds for three or four days . 
they &apos;re both coming back in a day or two , &quot; said one official familiar with the Mont Belvieu 1 operations . 
he added the two fractionators , which break down natural gas &quot; mix &quot; into different liquids such as propane and ethane , were shut down at the same time &quot; because they are tied-in together somewhat &quot; from a production and marketing standpoint . 
Mont Belvieu propane was offered at 35.0 cents a gallon , 0.75 cent higher than late Thursday , players said , with ethane offered one-cent stronger at 17.5 cents a gallon . 
another player said higher prices were less affected by the fractionator outage than by firmer crude , which was up 40 cents a barrel to $ 19.82 at 1200 EDT ( 1600 GMT ) . 
&quot; The fracationator situation is no big deal . 
if you add up the lost output of liquids , it &apos;s probably one million barrels of raw feed over a five-day period , but that will be made up pretty quickly once the units are brought back up , &quot; he said . 
Conway propane was sold for 35.0 cents , 0.25 cent higher than Thursday , players said , with ethane mix also 0.25-cent higher at 13.75 cents . 
Mont Belvieu purity ethane was offered at about 17.25 cents a gallon , 0.75 cent higher than prices late Thursday , players said .
