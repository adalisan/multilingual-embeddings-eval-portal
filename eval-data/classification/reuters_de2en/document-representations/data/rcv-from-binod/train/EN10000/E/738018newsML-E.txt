the new Socialist-led government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin , meeting on Thursday to discuss budget measures , could announce a special 10 percent increase on corporation tax , several French newspapers said . 
the La Tribune said the increase would be 10 percent , a similar increase conservative Prime Minister Alain Juppe announced in 1995 . 
the rate stands currently at 36.6 percent . 
les Echos and the Figaro said the increase , which would be announced for one year only , could net some 12 billion francs . 
the newspapers said the government could also cancel the personal tax cut announced by the previous government for 1997 . 
another measure could be an increase on the tax on income from life insurance , currently at 3.9 percent . 
papers also suggest the state could ask special contributions from the Caisse des depots et des Consingations as well as state-owned companies .
