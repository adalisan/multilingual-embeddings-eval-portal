the gap between the foreign and local share tranches of a range of Singapore blue chips continued to narrow on Friday following news that a government-owned group had scrapped the dual quotations of some of their listed units . 
some well-known Singapore companies , including all four of the big banks , Singapore Airlines , and the monopoly publisher Singapore Press , have split listings on strategic grounds . 
the local tranches can only be bought by Singaporeans or Singapore companies . 
foreign tranches can be bought by anyone . 
foreign tranches traditionally hold a premium over local tranches and tend to be much more volatile . 
scrapping the split between the tranches would remove this price differential . 
dealers say there is a growing expectation that the distinction between the tranches may erode and could possibly be scrapped . 
several dealers say they have advised clients to anticipate such a move .
