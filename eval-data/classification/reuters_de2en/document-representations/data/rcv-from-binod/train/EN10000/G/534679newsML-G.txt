the United States will be looking for their first title in 64 years and Canada will be looking for revenge when the ice hockey world championship begins on Saturday . 
the championship , which culminates with a best-of-three final from May 11 to 14 , will rekindle what has become ice hockey &apos;s most heated rivalry -- the U.S. and Canada . 
the two are both in Group B and meet on May 1 in what will be their first clash since the final of last September &apos;s inaugural World Cup in Vienna which was won by the Americans and sent Canadians into a national funk . 
their national pride dented by the Americanisation of the game they claim as their own , Canadians have been seething for an opportunity to get even . 
while Canada , and more recently the U.S. , are recognised as the sport &apos;s powers , their dominance has seldom extended to the world championship . 
with most of their best players locked into the Stanley Cup play-offs and unavailable for duty , world titles are hard to come by . 
until their victory in 1994 , Canada had gone 33 years without a win while the American drought stretches back to 1933 . 
since then , even trips to the podium have been rare , last year &apos;s bronze being the first American medal since 1962 . 
both the U.S. and Canadian teams will be almost completely stocked with players from teams eliminated from the NHL play-offs . 
Russia , Sweden , Finland , Slovakia and defending champions the Czech Republic will also be bolstered by NHL reinforcements . 
Canada &apos;s entry has been described by coaches as young , fast and tough . 
centre Chris Gratton , with 30 goals this season for Tampa Bay lightning , exemplifies all those things . 
he will be joined up front by the Hartford Whaler tandem of Keith Primeau and Geoff Sanderson , who potted 26 and 36 goals respectively . 
the defence will be anchored by Los Angeles Kings all-star Rob Blake while goaltending duties will fall to the Whalers &apos; Sean Burke . 
coach Andy Murray has left two places open on his 23-man roster and will fill them with players from teams knocked out of the first round of NHL play-offs . 
&quot; It &apos;s an interesting task trying to get guys to come , &quot; said Philadelphia flyer general manager Bobby Clarke , the man in charge of Canada &apos;s world championship and Olympic Games teams . 
&quot; The young guys want to come and play . 
the veterans don &apos;t . 
the United States will be fast up front but , with only two players who scored more than 20 goals this season , lack a strong finisher . 
the Americans will rely heavily on rookie of the year candidate Bryan Berard in defence . 
since capturing gold in Vienna last year the Czech Republic have fallen on hard times . 
dissent among players , coaches and officials forced Ludek Bukac , the man who guided them to their first world championship , to resign . 
Ludek has been replaced by former NHL man Ivan Hlinka and ex-Calgary flames assistant Slavomir Lener . 
captain Robert Reichel and by San Jose defenceman Vlastimil Kroupa are the only current NHL players in the team . 
Russia , who as the Soviet Union won 20 titles and eight Olympic golds , have been battling similar internal problems and struggling with the decay of system which once produced some of the world &apos;s top players . 
and after failing to even win a medal at the last three championships , the once feared Russians have made a podium finish their objective in Helsinki . 
&quot; The aim is to be among the four best teams at the championships and this may well be achieved , &quot; Mikhail Govorkov , spokesman for Russia &apos;s ice hockey federation said . 
Sweden and hosts Finland also hope to gain medals . 
Olympic champions Swedes will be looking to erase the embarrassment of a sixth-place finish in Vienna . 
their defence will be anchored by a trio of NHL defenceman , Calgary flames &apos; Tommy Albelin , Los Angeles Kings &apos; Mattias Norstrom and San Jose Sharks &apos; Marcus Ragnarsson . 
up front the Swedes will employ New York Islanders &apos; Niclas Andersson and Calgary &apos;s Jonas Hoglund , one of the top NHL rookies this season . 
the team &apos;s medal hopes , however , may depend on netminder Tommy Salo who worked 58 games in the New York Islanders net this season . 
Finland , world champions in 1995 , will hope home advantage will work in their favour . 
they will be in pool A along with Russia , Finland , Slovakia , Germany , France and the Czech Republic . 
pool B will feature Canada , the United States , Sweden , Italy , Norway and Latvia . 
the top three teams from each pool will advance to the knock-out stage .
