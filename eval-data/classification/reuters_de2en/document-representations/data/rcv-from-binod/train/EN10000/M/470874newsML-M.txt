the Philippine Central Bank &apos;s cut in overnight rates on Wednesday sent a signal that it was comfortable with the pace of growth but the move was expected to slightly weaken the peso , analysts and traders said . 
the Central Bank earlier said it lowered its overnight borrowing rate to 9.9 percent from 10 percent and its overnight lending rate to 12.65 from 12.75 percent . 
the action follows a 0.25 percentage point increase in U.S. interest rates , which typically would have spurred the Philippine Central Bank to raise rates to prevent an outflow of foreign funds . 
however , low inflation and adequate liquidity justified Manila &apos;s rate cut , analysts said . 
year-on-year inflation was 4.4 percent in February compared with 5.0 percent in January . 
&quot; Fundamentals show interest rates should go down . 
between now and the next reserve requirement cut in July , we expect no turbulence from the inflation side ... we see a further flattening of the yield curve , &quot; Antonio Agcaoili , treasurer of Banco Santander in Manila , said on Wednesday . 
analysts said they now see the bellwether 91-day Treasury bill rate sliding to 9.0 percent in the next few months and the peso trading at a lower range of 26.35 / 26.45 from the previous 26.30 / 36.35 . 
Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson told Reuters the Central Bank &apos;s easing was meant to complement domestic interest rates . 
he also said the Central Bank was comfortable with the peso as long as there was no speculation . 
the cut followed a continued decline in the 91-day T-bill rate to single-digit levels for two consecutive weeks . 
the 91-day T-bill rate slipped to 9.724 percent on Monday from a previous 9.804 percent . 
the last time the 91-day rate was in single-digits was in September 1995 . 
the peso tumbled to 26.37 on Wednesday from a previous close of 26.355 due to the higher U.S. interest rate and lower domestic rates , traders said . 
the peso &apos;s interest premium over the U.S. dollar had fallen to 1.904 percentage point , traders said . 
&quot; We &apos;re in a situation of adjustment towards a new equilibrium between interest rates and the peso-dollar rate , &quot; said Joey Cuyegkeng , research head of ING Barings Securities . 
but the peso is not expected to depreciate sharply since the Central Bank , armed with high international reserves , is expected to smooth any turbulence , market observers said . 
strong investment flows should also underpin the peso , they said . 
any weakness is expected to be brief as the currency was quick to recover when similar Philippine rate cuts occurred in the past few weeks , Santander &apos;s Agcaoili said . 
&quot; We likewise see a stable foreign exchange rate . 
the Central Bank has instilled a lot of confidence in the market , &quot; Agcaoili added . 
&quot; It ( the Central Bank &apos;s move ) just shows the good fundamentals of the Philippine economy . 
we &apos;re still confident of further growth with low inflation , &quot; said Paul Joseph Garcia , an economist at Metrobank .
