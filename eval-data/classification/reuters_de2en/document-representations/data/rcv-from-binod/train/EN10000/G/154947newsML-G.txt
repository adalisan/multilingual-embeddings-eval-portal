the eldest son of mass murderers Fred and Rosemary West on Wednesday urged teachers to be far more vigilant in watching out for signs of child abuse . 
&quot; The teachers should be trained in identifying abuse . 
in a programme being aired on child abuse , the 23-year-old West said : &quot; We went to school black and blue some days and nobody saw it . 
they accepted all the excuses we gave them . 
Rosemary West was sentenced to life imprisonment last November for her part in murdering 10 women and girls . 
nine bodies were dug up at the family home , dubbed the House of horrors by the press , that Rosemary shared with her husband Fred in Gloucester , western England . 
he confessed to killing 12 women but hanged himself in jail before he could be tried .
