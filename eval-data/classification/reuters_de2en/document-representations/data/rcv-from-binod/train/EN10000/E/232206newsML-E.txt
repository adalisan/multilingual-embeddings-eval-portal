Iraq has unfrozen $ 70 million worth of funds in a deal arranged by an Austrian firm in exchange for substantial commodities purchases , Jordanian traders said on Tuesday . 
Jordanian traders involved with the deal said it was coordinated by Vienna-based finance firm F.J. Elsner Company and had enabled Iraq to clinch one of its largest commodity purchases since U.N. sanctions were imposed on Baghdad for its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 . 
the deal includes supplying Iraq with 160,000-180,000 tonnes of U.K. and Argentine wheat , around 75,000 tonnes of Brazilian sugar , and one 33,000 tonnes cargo of Vietnamese rice . 
shipments are for November , December , and January for all the cargo . 
Iraq insisted on its only sea outlet Umm Qasr port , which can handle up to 30,000 tonnes of cargo per vessel , for offloading the cargo rather than Jordan &apos;s more developed Aqaba port , which is also closer to European and South American markets , traders said . 
traders said the recently concluded deal involved the Austrian firm playing a key role in &quot; putting in place the mechanism &quot; of unblocking around $ 70 million of frozen Iraqi assets in European accounts in exchange for the commodities . 
traders said payment terms were 30 days from date of shipment of the cargo . 
one Jordanian trader said the prices Iraq paid to Elsner had a considerable margin , with wheat purchases a high $ 224.5 per tonne and sugar around $ 425 per tonne . 
four 20,000 tonne cargos each of wheat arrived last month in Umm Qasr and one of the six sugar cargoes was already offloading , traders said . 
Elsner initialled the deal with grain traders Glencore and Toepfer , who are both supplying 70,000 tonnes and 90,000 tonnes each of wheat respectively along with the six 13,000 tonnes cargo each of Brazilian sugar and the Vietnamese rice . 
the purchases are in addition to a $ 12 million protocol deal recently negotiated between Pakistan and Iraq . 
Iraq originally tendered for 30,000 tonnes of Pakistani rice but actually bought 45,000 tonnes under the protocol at $ 245 per tonne , traders say . 
Iraq meets most of its needs for rice , estimated at about one million tonnes a year , through imports from either Pakistan , Vietnam and Thailand . 
Iraq &apos;s Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh left Jordan on Monday heading to Vietnam to reach deals for large quantities of rice under old debt settlement payment terms , traders said . 
some Jordanian agents of international grains suppliers have long-standing trade ties with Iraqi grains purchasing bodies and have begun positioning themselves for the coming oil-for-food deal . 
in Baghdad , Jordanian and Iraqi businessmen signed on Monday a commercial agreement for trade under Iraq &apos;s oil-for-food deal with the U.N. , the official al-Qadissiya newspaper reported on Tuesday . 
&quot; The Iraqi chambers of commerce and the society of Jordanian exporters signed a joint commercial protocol to lay down the framework of cooperation in commercial and economic fields , &quot; Qadissiya said . 
it said Dr. Bassam al-Sakit , head of Jordan &apos;s exporters society , and Zuheir Younis of Iraq &apos;s chambers of commerce signed the protocol in Baghdad . 
the paper gave no further details .
