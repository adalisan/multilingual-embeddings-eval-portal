Spanish and Portuguese bonds , currently stuck in slow , holiday trade , will closely watch the dollar / mark next week . 
&quot; At present there is a close relationship between bonds and the dollar and the market will focus greatly on the currency and on US indicators , &quot; said Henrik Lumholdt , Bank of America economist in Madrid . 
the absence of key domestic indicators next week and the slow market activity will force participants to focus on the U.S. and on dollar strength . 
&quot; Nothing big is expected next week , not only because of the lack of orders but also because of the absence of economic data &quot; , said Valentin Fernandez , chief economist at Credit Lyonnais in Madrid . 
&quot; In Spain the only news will be one-year and 18-month bill auctions as well as three- , five- , 10- and 15- year bonds as well as the regular repurchase tender for central bank certificates , &quot; he added . 
but Bank of America &apos;s Lumholdt said &quot; I don &apos;t think the bond auctions will have too much impact on prices , including futures , in such an inactive market . 
Fernandez , who expects the Bank of Spain to hold the key money rate steady next week , shares this view and believes both Spain and Portugal will be more concerned with the dollar / mark and the likely implications of the currency movements on the Bundesbank &apos;s monetary policy . 
&quot; I think most people will be more concerned with the dollar / mark and the implications for the Bundesbank . 
if the rate goes above 1.85 marks it is possible that the rumours of the Bundesbank returning to a variable repo rate will surface again , &quot; said Fernandez , who believes that these rumours would lead to price movements . 
&quot; We would see it reflected in the market and although Spain and Portugal would likely maintain the yield spread stable ( except in the event of statements about EMU ) , it would have an effect in absolute terms , particularly in the longer yields . 
over the last few days we have seen a levelling out of the curve and in a context of Bund correction we might see longer yields spiking . 
in such a case Portugal would suffer more &quot; , he added . 
however , for Lumholdt the likelihood of a return to a variable rate repo en Germany was already factored in and would not affect market prices . 
&quot; speculations about the Bundesbank might re-surface if the current dollar trend is maintained , but in my opinion the only thing that might happen is a return to a variable repo rate and that should not have any major repercussion even if it does mean a change in the central bank &apos;s policy &quot; , he indicated . 
dealers agreed that the spread with Germany in both Spain and Portugal would remain steady around current levels . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think we will see great variations in the spread in either Spain or Portugal as there as no changes in EMU expectations &quot; , said a dealer . 
&quot; It is difficult to see a change in this unless the actual process comes into question . 
Lumholdt agreed , saying , &quot; in terms of the spread with Germany I think we are trapped in a very tight range and it is difficult to see any movements outside of the current 60 / 65 basis points &quot; .
