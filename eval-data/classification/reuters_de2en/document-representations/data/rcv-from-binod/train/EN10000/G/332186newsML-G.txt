it said many of them were Serbs and Croats and others came from Russia , Poland , France , Belgium and Italy . 
it said they were being paid $ 2,000 a month , with a colonel getting $ 5,400 . 
France has denied any connection with , or knowledge of a mercenary force in Zaire . 
Zaire &apos;s government said on Thursday that its army had launched its promised counter-offensive against rebels in the east and recaptured the town of Walikale , killing 100 rebels including an unnamed chief .
