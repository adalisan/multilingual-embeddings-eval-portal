Bosnian Serbs opened fire across a border river at the Croatian town of Slavonski Brod for the first time in over a year , but no one was injured , Croatian media reported on Tuesday . 
Antun Pitlovic , head of Slavonski Brod County , told independent Radio 101 in Zagreb the Serbs had fired three rounds of machinegun fire from Bosanski Brod , on the Bosnian side of the Sava River , on Monday evening . 
they targeted the city &apos;s main pedestrian area but no one was injured , Pitlovic said . 
two hours later the Serbs opened fire again , shattering windows of family houses . 
&quot; We gave them no pretext to shoot . 
I hear they were celebrating the ( Orthodox ) Feast of St John yesterday , &quot; Pitlovic said . 
local radio had issued warnings to residents to take care and drivers were advised not to use certain exposed streets near the river but the city was quiet on Tuesday . 
Serbs in northern Bosnia often targeted Slavonski Brod and other settlements along the Croatian side of the Sava during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia . 
the war ended with the Dayton peace treaty signed in December 1995 .
