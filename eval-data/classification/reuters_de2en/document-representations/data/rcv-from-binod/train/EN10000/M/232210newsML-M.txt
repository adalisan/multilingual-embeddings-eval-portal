&quot; The market looks good and the mood is very positive . 
the stock market is recovering , the dollar is rising and new money is coming into the market , &quot; said a trader at IBI Investment House . 
CPI-linked bonds rose moderately today across the board . 
the main rise was in the ( variable-interest ) Kfir because the Bank of Israel did not issue Kfirs this week , she added . 
traders said it was almost impossible to buy inflation-linked bonds even outside the market as there was a complete absence of sellers . 
&quot; Unlinked bonds were mixed today posting only mild rise after two days of nice gains . 
the short Gilons were the main gainers after the long issues rose on Monday , &quot; said Amitay Tafla at Sigma Securities . 
traders noted that the Makams also rose even though the market has absorbed an issue of 1.3 billion shekels on Tuesday . 
the main gainers of the day were dollar-linked bonds , which rose sharply following the decline of the shekel against the dollar . 
&quot; The positive trend in dollar-linked bonds is expected to continue on Wednesday , &quot; Tafla said . 
in the local foreign currency market on Tuesday the representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.2920 shekels against 3.2730 on Monday . 
the dollar began rising on Monday against the shekel from a rate of 3.253 on Friday . 
note : Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year . 
the Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity .
