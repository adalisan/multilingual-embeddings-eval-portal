the man immortalised on screen as the pilot of the hapless Jamaican bobsled team says he plans to retire after a final attempt at Olympic glory at next year &apos;s Nagano Winter Games . 
&quot; I think Nagano will be my last Games , &quot; said Dudley Stokes , whose crew finished 21st of 24 teams in a World Cup event on Wednesday after tying for second-last place in their World Cup debut a day earlier . 
&quot; Ill be 36 years old , &quot; said the only remaining member of the team whose Calgary Olympic exploits nine years ago inspired the 1993 film &quot; Cool Runnings &quot; . 
&quot; I have two young children at home and this ( bobsledding ) is a very time-consuming thing . 
Stokes , who says his four-year-old son and three-year-old daughter have yet to sit through a showing of the film , has one goal left before giving up the sport . 
after crashing at Calgary , then placing 24th at the 1992 Albertville Games and 14th two years later at Lillehammer , Stokes says he wants to crack the top 10 at Nagano . 
&quot; That is the objective and I think it is achieveable , &quot; said the 34-year-old Jamaican celebrity . 
to help to turn their dream into reality , Stokes and his crew have rustled up sponsorship of about $ 100,000 from a beer-making company , a resort hotel chain and the Jamaican Tourist Board . 
but that is just a fraction of what other teams spend and the shortage of money restricts the team &apos;s preparations and strains their personal resources . 
Stokes is self-employed . 
&quot; The reason for this is that I am basically unemployable because I spend all my time bobsledding , &quot; said the qualifed helicopter pilot who owns a stake in a Kingston company offering tourist flights . 
two of his crew are more fortunate . 
as national team members , Ricky McIntosh and Winston Watt continue to be paid by their government employers while away training . 
Randy Thomas , a machinist , gets paid only when competing . 
their first-ever World Cup appearance on the new Olympic spiral track is part of their Nagano preparations which the team began in November , more than a year before the Games , Stokes said . 
they had only six months to get ready for Lillehammer , he added . 
instead of bemoaning their lot in comparison with richer teams , Stokes prefers to regard the Jamaicans &apos; skimpy competition schedule as an advantage that leaves him fresher than other drivers . 
he also tries to compensate for lack of track experience by using mental imagery , he said . 
the Jamaicans and other teams are scheduled to remain in Nagano for four days of testing on the 15-curve spiral track .
