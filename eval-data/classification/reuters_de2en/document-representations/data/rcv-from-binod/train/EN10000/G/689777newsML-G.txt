more than 80 countries have signed the Declaration of Brussels preparing a landmine ban treaty despite opposition from the U.S. , diplomats said on Thursday . 
&quot; We have 86 countries who have signed the Brussels declaration now , by the end of the conference tomorrow we may reach 100 , &quot; a diplomatic source told Reuters . 
a total 115 countries are taking part in the Brussels talks , which aim to prepare the signing of the first-ever treaty to ban the production , use , stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel landmines . 
the treaty is due to be signed in Ottawa , Canada , in December 1997 . 
&quot; It looks like this conference will be a success , &quot; Susan Walker , director of the U.S. branch of Handicap International , told Reuters . 
but both diplomats and representatives of non-governmental organisations present at the conference blasted the U.S. for trying to undermine the landmine ban treaty . 
&quot; We are particularly concerned that U.S. delegates ... are pressing for an explicit exception for new use of all mines in Korea and the continued use of smart mines indefinitely anywhere in the world , &quot; Stephen goose of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines ( ICBL ) , said in a statement . 
the U.S. which is attending the Brussels conference with observer status , will not sign because it favours separate United Nations-sponsored landmine talks in Geneva . 
these talks , which require consensus , are not expected to produce a landmine ban for some years , although the U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament appointed a special co-ordinator on the subject on Thursday , signalling agreement by Third World states that it be tackled on its own and no longer tied to deadlocked nuclear topics . 
the ICBL statement said the U.S. now stands with Greece and Turkey as the only NATO countries not on board the Ottawa talks . 
&quot; We remain hopeful that the U.S. will sign the treaty this December but we would prefer that the U.S. stay outside of the process rather than contribute to the creation of a treaty full of loopholes , exceptions and reservations , &quot; Mary Wareham of the Vietnam Veterans of America , said . 
the signatories of the Brussels declaration so far include African , central American and some Asian countries as well as all 15 European Union nations with the exception of Greece and Finland . 
Greece refuses to sign because of territorial disputes with Turkey while Finland refuses because of its long border with Russia . 
the ICBL welcomed Malaysia &apos;s decision to sign the Brussels Declaration but deplored that only a handful of Asian nations -- Cambodia , Malaysia , New Zealand , Papua New Guinea and the Philippines -- are full participants . 
in addition to the U.S. , 36 other delegations are taking part in the Brussels talks with observer status . 
they include Cuba , Greece , India , Indonesia , Iran , Israel , Libya , Pakistan , the Palestinian Authority and Turkey . 
Russia and China , the main producers of landmines , are not taking part in the talks .
