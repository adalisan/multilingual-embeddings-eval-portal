veteran Petr Korda brought fifth-seeded Czech Republic back from the brink of elimination on Sunday , beating India &apos;s Leander Paes to level their Davis Cup world group first round tie . 
Korda , who announced after the match he was retiring from Davis Cup play , won a hard fought 5-7 6-3 6-4 6-1 over Indian number one Paes in the first reverse singles on Sunday , setting up a showdown between Czech number two Jiri Novak and Mahesh Bhupathi . 
Korda , ranked 33rd in the world , had little trouble in dispatching Paes , overpowering the Indian at the net and unleashing powerful groundstrokes from the baseline . 
he squandered five break points in the first set , while Paes , ranked 105th in the world , took advantage of the only one he had to take the first set in 53 minutes . 
but Korda showed no signs of a cold that has plagued him throughout the week , quickly getting back on track to take the next three sets . 
after the win , Korda said he would no longer play for the Czechs in the Davis Cup , complaining of the demands it put on a player . 
&quot; There was a lot of pressure on me for this match , but I showed the kind of player I am , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I have thought about retiring ( from Davis Cup ) for a while and it &apos;s time to leave . 
it is a very tiring , draining experience and I think you should leave at the top . 
now is the right time . 
Korda , who was once ranked 50th in the world , has been the anchor of the Czech team since his debut in 1988 , compiling a 30-12 overall record , including three wins against India this weekend .
