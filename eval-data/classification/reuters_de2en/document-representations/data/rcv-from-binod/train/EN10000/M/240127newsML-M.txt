U.S refined oil product prices remained lower Friday afternoon as NYMEX futures traders continued to digest bearish news on apparently imminent Iraqi oil sales and the end of French oil strikes . 
spot traders said the news had given buyers serious pause before doing deals , and noted gasoline differentials were sinking . 
they added the reports took any bearishness out of news of refinery problems on the U.S. Gulf Coast &apos;s &quot; refinery Row . 
gasoline prices were off by 0.80 cent to nearly two cents a gallon , while distillate prices were about 0.80 cent lower with the NYMEX doing most , if not all of , the bearish work . 
on the gasoline front , diffs weakened the most dramatically on the U.S. Gulf Coast , where prompt &quot; M4 &quot; conventional gasoline was talked 1.25 cents weaker at between 5.25 and 5.00 cents under January NYMEX . 
in New York Harbor , prompt &quot; A5 &quot; winter-grade regular 87-octane reformulated gasoline ( RFG ) was heard offered at 0.90 cent over the screen -- which would mean diffs had weakened by over 2.00 cents , though traders were quick to note that bids were scarce which made the significance of the lower offers difficult to gauge .
