CBOT soymeal futures ended mixed with nearby contracts up on market talk that Brazil may soon impose an export tax on soybeans and soymeal , traders said . 
&quot; There was talk Brazil might reinstitute some kind of export tax , &quot; said Bob Lekberg , Goldenberg-Hehmeyer analyst . 
&quot; This is the same talk that floated around a few weeks ago . 
the meal came back very strongly on it . 
but neither Brazil &apos;s agricultural nor finance ministries knew of a proposal to impose an export tax and Lekberg and others discounted the rumor . 
&quot; The ( Brazil ) Finance Ministry is not formulating any proposal to put a tax on soybean or soymeal exports and knows of no proposal to do so , &quot; a spokesman there said . 
Soyoil was weakened by the strength in soymeal and ideas supplies were sufficient to meet lackluster demand . 
new crop months were pressured by ideas U.S. soybean plantings were progressing well despite a cool , damp spring . 
USDA on Monday said nine percent of the U.S. soybean crop was seeded as of Sunday , above trade expectations and above the four percent five-year average . 
soymeal ended up $ 2.70 per ton to down $ 1.70 while soyoil ended 0.11 cent per lb lower to 0.10 cent higher . 
on the day , SAK futures bought 1,200 lots July soymeal , Refco Inc bought 200 July and 100 August , and Cargill Inc bought 300 July , pit sources said . 
ADM and Continental grain each sold 300 July and Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney each sold 200 July . 
in soyoil , Cargill sold 300 lots each July and December and 100 lots August , Dean Witter bought 150 July and Griffin Trading bought 100 July , pit sources said . 
in spread action , Dean Witter spread 400 lots July / May at 0.22 cent , premium July , and Produce grain spread 150 lots July / May at 0.22 to 0.25 cent , premium July . 
soymeal volume was estimated by CBOT at 25,000 lots , compared with Monday &apos;s actual volume of 26,723 .
