yet another vestige of British military presence in Hong Kong will disappear on Friday as the handover of the colony to China next year draws closer . 
to the skirl of pipes and drums , a squadron of Gurkha sappers -- or field engineers -- will be disbanded at the end of the week , a British military spokesman said on Wednesday . 
the Commander of British Forces in Hong Kong , Major-General Bryan Dutton , will take the salute at the disbandment parade of the 67 Gurkha Independent Field Squadron , Queen &apos;s Gurkha Engineers . 
the squadron first served in Hong Kong between 1962 and 1966 , and returned to the teritory from Malaysia in 1970 . 
they had assisted in road building projects in remote parts of Nepal , near Everest over the past two years . 
symbols of British colonialism in Hong Kong are fast fading in the countdown to the handover in 300 days time , at midnight on June 30 , 1997 .
