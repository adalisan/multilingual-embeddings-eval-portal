key June Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures ended Thursday &apos;s Tokyo session slightly lower . 
the key contract closed down 0.04 at 126.58 . 
it rose as high as 126.87 in the morning session . 
turnover of the June contract was 41,896 . 
&quot; Some dealers liquidated long positions after the June contract failed to test the record high . 
a rise in Tokyo stocks also capped its upside , &quot; said a trader at a city bank &apos;s securities unit . 
the record high for any benchmark JGB futures contract is 126.92 set on Wednesday . 
in the cash JGB market , investors , including some life insurers , were selling the short- and medium-term sector while buying at the long end of the yield curve , traders said . 
&quot; The long end of the yield curve continued to attract investor buying throughout the session , &quot; said a trader at a brokerage house . 
&quot; Some investors were seen selling six-year JGBs . 
we also heard of some players bidding on the payment side in the seven-year sector in the interest rate swap market . 
these factors may have been responsible for capping JGB futures , &quot; said a trader at another city bank &apos;s securities unit . 
traders said JGB futures are likely eventually to test new highs , but the mood was cautious ahead of a visit to Tokyo by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and the release of U.S. employment data on Friday . 
&quot; The June is likely to test 127.00 , but not so soon . 
the downside may also be limited as investors are still keen to buy cash JGBs on dips , &quot; said the brokerage house trader . 
the coupon for April issues of government-guaranteed and municipal bonds was set at a record-low 2.4 percent , down from 2.6 percent for the March issues , the finance and home ministries said on Thursday . 
traders said these bonds were not meeting good investor demand as their coupons were set below the 2.5 percent April 10-year JGB . 
by contrast , 10-year and 15-year corporate straight bonds launched by Keio Teito Electric Railway Co Ltd on Thursday were met by good investor demand , traders said . 
the coupons for the new Keio bonds were set at 2.7 percent for the 10-year and 3.075 percent for the 15-year . 
the yield of the benchmark cash 182nd JGB stood at 2.175 percent , down from 2.180 percent on Wednesday .
