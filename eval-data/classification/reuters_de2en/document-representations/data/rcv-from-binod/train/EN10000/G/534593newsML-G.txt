world championship leader Jacques Villeneuve threatened on Thursday to quit Formula One if proposed rule changes designed to make racing safer are approved for the 1998 season . 
the 26-year-old Canadian created uproar in the paddock at Imola by insisting the planned changes , involving the use of grooved tyres and narrower cars , were &quot; ridiculous &quot; and would destroy Formula One as a spectacle . 
speaking on the eve of the opening day &apos;s practice for the San Marino Grand Prix , Villeneuve said : &quot; These new regulations are just a joke . 
&quot; To run on these tyres is just ridiculous . 
it takes all the precision out of the driving and the racing -- as well as the fun -- and it is just a ridiculous idea . 
&quot; These rules turn the cars into Formula Ford cars again and if it does go that way I will think seriously about returning to Indycar racing next year . 
&quot; I am sure a lot of the other drivers will do the same . 
after hearing the criticisms made by Villeneuve , who tested the proposed new tyres with his Williams team in Barcelona last week , FIA president Max Mosley said the driver &apos;s opinions required &quot; urgent attention . 
but , Mosley added , it was too early to make any final judgements on the proposed regulation changes . 
Villeneuve said he felt the rules should be left alone , or go in the opposite direction -- reverting to wider rear tyres to increase the level of mechanical grip . 
&quot; It is always better than aerodynamic grip .... it allows you to fight better and to stay closer to someone . 
the racing would be much better . 
while the Canadian debated the future , Giancarlo Fisichella , the young Italian who was sent crashing out of the Argentine Grand Prix two weekends ago following a collision with his Jordan team-mate Ralf Schumacher , looked back witheringly on the recent past . 
he said the &apos; accident &apos; -- which wrecked his hopes of finishing the race -- had ended the pair &apos;s friendship . 
&quot; Our friendship is completely finished , &quot; he said , despite reports the two had met and patched up their strained partnership during testing at Silverstone last week . 
&quot; We will work together , but we will not be going out together anymore as friends .
