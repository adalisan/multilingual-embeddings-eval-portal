White sugar futures held steady in modest volume on Tuesday afternoon as the New York raws market edged higher , with spreads mostly staying quiet and activity dominated by outright trades . 
Commission houses accounted for most of the day &apos;s turnover and at least one appeared on both sides of the market for different clients . 
&quot; It &apos;s a mixed bag , there &apos;s not one person doing anything outstanding -- it looks reasonably steady , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; It &apos;s more outrights than anything else . 
October rallied to a high of $ 328.00 , battling scale sellers along the way , but then slipped back to stand $ 1.10 firmer at $ 327.50 by 1630 GMT . 
December was up 80 cents at $ 324.50 and overall volume reached 1,992 lots , mostly in October and March . 
in New York , fund buying drove October raws to a fresh contract high of 12.00 cents / lb but then producer pricing pared gains and pushed the market back into its recent trading range . 
technically , October &apos;s short-term momentum indicators have turned higher into positive territory after hovering around neutral for the last couple of sessions . 
open interest in March has now overtaken that in spot October , which is slated to expire on September 15 . 
the level of open interest in second-month December , usually considered as a seasonally less liquid position , is lower than both October and March .
