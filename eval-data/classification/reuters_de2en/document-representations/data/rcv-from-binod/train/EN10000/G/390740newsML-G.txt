U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on Thursday she had made a good start to talks with Russian leaders in Moscow . 
it was a matter of establishing a relationship and getting to know each other , &quot; she told reporters after talks with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin . 
&quot; Then we got down to work , &quot; she said . 
Albright , who is on her first trip to Russia as secretary of state , declined to give details of her discussions on NATO &apos;s plans to expand eastwards , which are opposed by Moscow . 
&quot; I am not going to characterise those at this point , &quot; she said .

her spokesman , Nicholas Burns , said the meetings had been &quot; very constructuve and very detailed &quot; and conducted in a warm atmosphere . 
he quoted Primakov as telling Albright : &quot; I &apos;m going to be nice to you &quot; . 
burns said topics had included a &quot; range of issues &quot; which each sides felt should be discussed in Helsinki and proposals NATO is making to try to ease Russian fears over the Western alliance &apos;s plans to offer membership to former Warsaw Pact states .
