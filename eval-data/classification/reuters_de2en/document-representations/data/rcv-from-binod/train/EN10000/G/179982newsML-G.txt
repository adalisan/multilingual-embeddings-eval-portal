the Guatemalan government and leftist rebels announced on Monday that they will formally end 36 years of war with a peace treaty to be signed on Dec . 29 . 
&quot; We have just set the date for putting an end to 36 years of confrontation and that will be the signing of a peace agreement on Dec . 29 , &quot; President Alvaro Arzu told an Ibero-American summit meeting in Vina Del Mar , Chile . 
in Mexico City , the guerrilla leader who leads the peace negotiating team for the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit ( URNG ) , Pablo Monsanto , said the signing &quot; will be on that date and in Guatemala City . 
Arzu &apos;s surprise announcement in Chile drew loud applause from the leaders of 20 other countries at the summit . 
until last week , Arzu had planned to sign the agreement on Dec . 15 , the culmination of five years of negotiations to end Central America &apos;s last and longest civil war in which 100,000 people have died and an estimated 40,000 disappeared . 
but the date was moved after a recent crisis in the talks . 
the peace negotiations , which had been running smoothly for months , were abruptly suspended in October after rebel commander Rafael Valdizon was arrested on suspicion of kidnapping an elderly member of an influential family . 
police briefly jailed him but let him go in return for freeing 86-year-old Olga Alvarado de novella , matriarch of the family that owns Guatemala &apos;s only cement company . 
after 12 tense days of tense silence from the government and a series of concessions from guerrilla leaders , talks resumed last weekend . 
the guerrilla high command denied knowing anything about the kidnapping before Valdizon was arrested . 
but before the talks could get back on track , one of the top four guerrilla leaders , Valdizon &apos;s direct commander , agreed to withdraw from the negotiating table . 
the U.N.-brokered peace talks have dragged on since 1991 , interrupted for months at a time at some points . 
but both sides are determined to complete negotiations before 1997 . 
Monsanto said the current round of negotiations on a ceasefire will conclude on Monday . 
after ending talks on the ceasefire , government and rebel negotiators have a tight schedule in the next seven weeks . 
they still must hammer out details of the future political role of URNG fighters , election and constitutional reforms , and a calendar for the implementation of the accords .
