copper business was erratic on the LME on Friday , with the market thrashing around either side of overnight closing levels before late covering ensured a higher close , traders said . 
at one time the market seemed set for a smooth upward run , with a rise above $ 1,940 fostered by a 2,100-tonne warehouse stock fall this morning . 
but recent uncertainty over direction was maintained , with liquidation this afternoon driving prices down to near $ 1,910 before the mini-rally on the late kerb . 
&quot; In reality , there is little sense or consistency in the market at the moment . 
it is getting pushed from pillar to post without much volume at times , &quot; one trader said . 
overhanging the market is the recent narrowing in spread backwardations , which perhaps favours a downside test , although the influence of the underlying options market could easily negate this . 
technical traders said the market is ranging between $ 1,910 and $ 1,970 , and easily able to test both ends in a single session . 
last trade on Friday was at $ 1,933 , up $ 8 from Thursday . 
the cash / threes backwardation held relatively stable at $ 9 , but is only a shadow of the $ 60 premium of a week ago . 
little tightness is expected between now and the third Wednesday September date , traders said . 
aluminium market sentiment was hurt by the recent break under $ 1,500 , as well as today &apos;s 6,625-tonne inventory increase , and prices threatened to break down to $ 1,470 at one stage . 
however , late end-week covering arrested the decline , and last trade was at $ 1,484 , still down $ 8 . 
nickel trading was whippy today , with the market at one time threatening to break below $ 7,400 before late covering helped erase early losses . 
there was also talk of shipping problems from Norilsk , although this seems to be without foundation . 
prices jumped above $ 7,500 during an excitable kerb , finishing the day at $ 7,520 , up $ 20 a tonne . 
lead prices clawed away from a test of the $ 800 level , but still finished in the minus column as the cash / threes backwardation narrowed slightly . 
last three months business was at $ 809.50 , down $ 4 . 
zinc came under technical pressure , with the market unable to hold above $ 1,040 , and prices slid back into the old $ 1,030 / 1,040 band , despite a 2,775-tonne stock fall today . 
last trade was at $ 1,034 , down $ 6 . 
tin took advantage of copper &apos;s kerb upturn to revert back towards the mid- $ 6,200 area the market has languished in for most of the week . 
a 525-tonne stock decline was also supportive , and prices closed at $ 6,240 / 50 , up $ 20 . 
Alloy trading was lacklustre and the market was indicated at a softer $ 1,278 / 82 a tonne by the end of the kerb .
