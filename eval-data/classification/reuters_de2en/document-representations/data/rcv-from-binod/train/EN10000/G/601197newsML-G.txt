the Kremlin on Wednesday dismissed suggestions that Russia might join NATO , one day after a U.S. official said membership of the Western defence alliance remained open to an unlimited number of countries . 
&quot; I think realism and common sense tell us this is just a hypothetical possibility which has nothing to do with reality , &quot; Sergei Prikhodko , President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s top foreign policy adviser , told Ekho Moskvy radio station in an interview . 
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said on Tuesday Russia was among the countries for which NATO &apos;s doors would be open after a first group is offered membership at an alliance summit in Madrid in July . 
Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic are expected to be offered membership . 
Romania and Slovenia also hope to be in the first wave of new members . 
Prikhodko , who has been advising Yeltsin for less than two months , said Moscow still regarded the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation &apos;s expansion as a mistake which would not help stability in the region . 
but he hailed the agreement on a new relationship between Russia and NATO which Yeltsin and alliance leaders are due to sign in Paris next Tuesday . 
&quot; We are minimising the risks in the expansion of NATO and moving away from confrontation , &quot; he said . 
ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky , on the other hand , denounced the deal with NATO and compared it with Moscow &apos;s 1939 pact with Nazi Germany which failed to prevent a German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 . 
&quot; It very much recalls the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact of 1939 . 
we concluded a non-aggression pact and what happened within two years ? 
&quot; Only one thing awaits us . 
either dissolution into NATO and becoming a servant-girl or they begin war against us . 
Yeltsin &apos;s communists foes have also criticised the deal , under which Moscow will gain a say in NATO matters which directly concern Russia but will have no veto over the alliance &apos;s expansion . 
Alexander Lebed , the former Kremlin security adviser who is now a Yeltsin opponent , attacked the agreement on Tuesday . 
&quot; This is an empty document and Russia is being engaged in a new re-division of Europe before our eyes , &quot; he told a news conference .
