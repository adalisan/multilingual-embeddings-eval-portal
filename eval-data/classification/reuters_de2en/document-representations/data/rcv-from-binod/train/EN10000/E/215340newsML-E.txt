Asia-Pacific leaders , taking concrete steps at their summit to forge the world &apos;s biggest free trade zone , backed on Monday U.S. plans to free global commerce in information technology . 
U.S. President Bill Clinton hailed the qualified support of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) as a &quot; big deal &quot; that would boost U.S. exports and create better jobs . 
support for cutting tariffs on an annual $ 500 billion global trade in computers , memory chips and telecommunications equipment was a highlight of a declaration by leaders of APEC &apos;s 18 member economies after a summit in Subic Bay . 
&quot; Every year we sell $ 100 billion in information technology and that sector supports almost two million jobs in the United States , &quot; Clinton said after the one-day summit . 
&quot; So imagine if we went to zero tariffs in the entire world . 
that would mean to America more exports and higher paying jobs , &quot; he told U.S. embassy employees . 
the meeting endorsed an action plan for a single Pacific Rim economy by 2020 embracing half of humanity . 
on the lawn of the summit site in Subic Bay , a former U.S. naval base , Philippine President Fidel Ramos read a declaration calling for &quot; substantial , concrete , measurable and sustainable results &quot; to translate APEC &apos;s lofty goals into reality . 
earlier , some of the region &apos;s most powerful business executives met to forge deals and contacts and act as a &quot; reality check &quot; on the meeting . 
leftwing protesters in a motorcade of 500 gaily-decorated jeepneys -- minibus copies of World War Two U.S. jeeps -- denounced free trade as fantasy . 
Orgnisers halted the caravan more than halfway north along the road from Manila to Subic , saying confrontation with heavily armed riot police would be suicide . 
at least five people were injured on Monday in a clash between supporters and foes of APEC near Subic Bay . 
the Manila People &apos;s Forum on APEC urged politicians to &quot; wake up to the reality that our legacy , our dignity , our culture and poor natural world are being drained away instead into the offshore accounts of global robber barons &quot; . 
Ramos brushed aside such concerns , saying the aim of APEC was to &quot; create a bigger and bigger pie to divide &quot; . 
on Sunday he agreed with Chinese President Jiang Zemin to swap visits to each other &apos;s capitals and end an almost decade-long chill . 
Washington was pressing for zero tariffs on information technology by 2000 , and got much of what it wanted after Clinton made a personal summit pitch to harden-up earlier support offered by APEC trade ministers . 
the declaration called on the World Trade Organisation to &quot; substantially eliminate tariffs by the year 2000 &quot; in its first ministerial meeting in Singapore next month . 
but it &quot; recognised the need for flexibility &quot; . 
U.S. Trade Representative spokesman Jay Ziegler said : &quot; Substantially eliminate is tradespeak for zero . 
Jiang , however , indicated that the United States still had a fight on its hands . 
&quot; Because of the differences in the levels of economic development in the member economies , it is very difficult for the liberalisation in the field to be pushed forward in accordance with a timetable , &quot; China &apos;s official Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying . 
China is not a member of the WTO , and in his meeting with Jiang on Saturday Clinton made clear it would not get U.S. support for entry until it did more to open its markets . 
Jiang said Beijing would cut import duties to an average 15 percent by 2000 after reducing them to an average 23 percent this year . 
in a clifftop summit hall overlooking Subic Bay , leaders of economies from China to Papua New Guinea and Chile to Canada spent six hours working out a Manila Action Plan ( MAPA ) . 
the plan fused a raft of market-opening measures offered by individual APEC members . 
dressed in Filipino Barong shirts , leaders agreed on nitty-gritty details to create a free trade and investment zone with no customs posts , visas or red tape to block the flow of goods , services and business travellers . 
APEC calls for developed countries to free all trade by 2010 and developing nations by 2020 .
