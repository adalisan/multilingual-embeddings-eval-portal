Russia is failing to profit from an economic boom in the Asian-Pacific region because it remains too heavily focused on western Europe and the United States , the Japanese ambassador to Moscow said on Wednesday . 
&quot; A rather sad picture is emerging of the Japanese looking increasingly to the Asian region and of the Russians being unable to tear their gaze from the West , &quot; Interfax news agency quoted Takehiro Togo as saying . 
in a lecture delivered to the Institute for World Economy and International Relations , Togo said Russia &apos;s lack of interest in the fast-developing region was partly to blame for the poor state of relations between Moscow and Tokyo . 
&quot; In the view of many Japanese Russia is a terrible country . 
I think that quite a few Russians think similarly of Japan , &quot; he added . 
distrust has bedevilled relations between Russia and Japan since tsarist times when Russian troops pushed their way across Siberia to the Pacific Ocean . 
the two countries have gone to war several times this century and relations have remained chilly since World War Two due to the Soviet seizure in 1945 of four tiny islands off Japan &apos;s northern coast . 
Togo said there could be no lasting improvement in bilateral ties until the territorial dispute had been resolved . 
Tokyo wants Moscow to return the islands but has also recently signalled that it would consider taking part in joint economic development of the islands , known in Russia as the Southern Kuriles and in Japan as the Northern Territories . 
Togo said Russia &apos;s first vice-premier Viktor Ilyushin would visit Japan in March to attend a session of the inter-governmental commission on economic relations . 
Russian Defence Minister Igor Rodionov and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin are also expected to visit Japan during 1997 , Interfax quoted Togo as saying .
