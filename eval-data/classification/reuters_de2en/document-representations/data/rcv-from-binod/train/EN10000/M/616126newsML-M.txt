Canadian bonds closed weaker on Tuesday , with spreads to U.S. long bonds widening amid stronger than expected U.S. consumer confidence data and a sliding Canadian dollar , analysts said . 
&quot; It &apos;s the first time we &apos;ve closed through seven percent in the U.S. since the end of April . 
that was driven to some extent by that very strong consumer confidence number this morning . 
that has led the markets lower , &quot; said Jim Webber , director of fixed-income research with TD Securities Inc . 
the U.S. 30-year bond fell 15 / 32 to yield 7.03 percent . 
the spread between the bonds widened to 11 basis points from seven basis points at the close of trading on Monday . 
Canadian bonds weakened this morning with U.S. treasuries on a report that an index of U.S. consumer confidence surged in May to a 28-year high . 
the data sparked concern the U.S. Federal Reserve was now more likely to hike rates at the next meeting of its Open Market Committee . 
also hurting Canadian bonds was a slide in the currency , which was hit by pre-election jitters . 
the weakness prompted two rounds of intervention by the Bank of Canada . 
&quot; Everybody was very clear a week ago on how they thought it ( election ) was going to go . 
there &apos;s just a bit more uncertainty now about how that &apos;s going to end up , &quot; said TD &apos;s Webber . 
in the short end , dealers said there was uneven demand for this afternoon &apos;s auction of C $ 4.4 billion three-month , six-month and one-year T-bills . 
&quot; technically , the market wasn &apos;t set up well for the market today , &quot; said one T-bill trader with a bank-owned brokerage . 
&quot; The one-years were quite sloppy . 
the U.S. 10-year bond fell 9 / 32 to yield 6.79 percent . 
the negative spread between the two bonds narrowed to 19 basis points from 23 basis points at the close of trading on Monday . 
the three-month cash T-bill traded with a yield of 3.03 percent against its U.S. equivalent , which yielded 5.18 percent .
