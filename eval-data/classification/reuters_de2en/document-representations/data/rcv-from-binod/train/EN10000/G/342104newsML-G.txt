the Belgian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday it was concerned about reports on the presence of foreign troops in Zaire which , if confirmed , would be totally unacceptable . 
&quot; We are receiving more and more reports about the presence of regular Rwandan troops in eastern Zaire . 
if these can be confirmed , this would be an unacceptable violation of the territorial integrity of Zaire , &quot; spokesman Andre Querton said . 
he said the reports spoke of a &quot; meaningful number &quot; of Rwandan units in the Kivu area , who had moved into the region after the seizure of eastern Zaire by Zairean rebels . 
Zaire has repeatedly accused Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi of backing rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire ( ADFL ) , led by veteran opposition politician Laurent Kabila . 
commenting on a statement by the military high command in Kinshasa alleging that several thousand Ugandan troops had invaded Zaire , Querton said this too would be a violation of the country &apos;s territorial integrity . 
Uganda said the Zairean allegations were false . 
Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke will discuss various issues involving Zaire , Rwanda and Burundi at meetings in New York on Tuesday with United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and with United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Washington on Wednesday .
