new Zealand share prices ended 1.09 percent lower on Friday after profit-takers singled out Telecom and Carter Holt Harvey for special attention . 
the NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 25.71 points down at 2,327.20 on turnover worth NZ $ 81 million . 
telecom ended 15 cents down at NZ $ 7.24 , topping the turnover list at $ 25.68 million . 
Carter Holt Harvey lost 12 cents to close at $ 3.26 and came second on the list at $ 9.98 million . 
other leaders also struggled , with a few exceptions . 
don Turkington at Cavill White Securities said it was a lacklustre end to a highly volatile week . 
&quot; It was a week of consolidation , but really today was characterised by some pretty solid selling in the leaders , &quot; he said . 
the very strong New Zealand dollar , coupled with a sharp appreciation in share values , had proved far too tempting for overseas investors , he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s a bit disappointing that we could not maintain the surge that we saw yesterday after the Reserve Bank eased but we are in pretty good company , &quot; Turkington said , noting weakness in the U.S. , Australian and Japanese markets . 
while the market had lost about 1.5 percent over the week , it was still ahead considering the five percent gain last week . 
the Reserve Bank &apos;s comment on Thursday that conditions were a bit firmer than necessary was encouraging for equities . 
&quot; So we could expect a reasonable market here , the proviso to that being that the Dow this week has been pretty soft , so that is a worry . 
the Dow seems to be going through a reasonably sizeable correction at the moment , so that could take some of the drive out of this market , &quot; Turkington said . 
the market reopens on Tuesday after the Labour Day holiday on Monday .
