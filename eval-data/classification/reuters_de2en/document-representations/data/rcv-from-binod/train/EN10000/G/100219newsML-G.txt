the French head of a new naval force grouping four southern European countries said on Monday the unit was not trying to compete against the Anglo-Saxon allies or north European states . 
&quot; Some people wish to see us as a sort of challenge to the the so-called domination of Anglo-Saxon countries or of northern countries in general , &quot; said Admiral Philippe Durteste , commander of the Euromarfor force . 
&quot; This is obviously untrue , &quot; said Durteste , taking over command of Euromarfor ( European Maritime Force ) , grouping the navies of NATO members France , Italy , Spain and Portugal . 
the force was set up in May 1995 for possible European operations outside the framework of the U.S.-led Atlantic Alliance . 
Durteste said Euromarfor was &quot; an example of cooperation between navies that were geographically close and used to working with one another ... we are not a European challenge to NATO . 
Durteste spoke as he formally assumed command of the force from Spanish Admiral Acedo Manteola .
