President Boris Yeltsin said on Friday Russia &apos;s top priority this year would be reorganising the military , making clear he would not be cowed by a top general &apos;s call on officers to resist reforms . 
&quot; This year our first concern will be military reform . 
the Russian army must be mobile and highly organised , equipped with high-tech weapons , &quot; Yeltsin said in a nationwide radio address . 
his comments , in a speech reflecting on the first year of his second term as president , were a clear rebuff to respected General Lev Rokhlin , who has said the armed forces would be ruined by the downscaling Yeltsin is planning . 
Yeltsin , by contrast , said the parlous state of the vast military made speedy reform essential . 
&quot; Today , just imagine , the list of army shortages contains cooking pots and the most sophisticated modern equipment . 
that means just one thing -- we must not drag out military reform . 
Rokhlin &apos;s open address to Yeltsin a fortnight ago was seen by many political analysts as an early warning from Russia &apos;s powerful top brass , worried by planned drastic cuts in the army to make it a professional rather than conscript force . 
the Kremlin has said it is does not think there will be a rebellion in the military . 
defence Minister Igor Sergeyev reinforced the determination to reform in a speech to the upper house of parliament on Friday . 
Sergeyev pulled no punches , saying Russia &apos;s ability to defend itself was dismal and getting worse . 
&quot; The armed forces of the Russian Federation are in critical condition and continue to deteriorate , &quot; he said . 
his listeners needed no convincing . 
several of the regional leaders in the chamber told horror stories about a stolen plane , exploding ammunuition stores , the dumping of 600,000 tonnes of kerosine and decommissioned nuclear submarines left unattended . 
echoing his predecessor , Sergeyev complained his ministry did not have enough money but unlike Igor Rodionov -- fired by Yeltsin in a fit of pique in May -- he gave a clear outline of the reform measures planned for the next few years . 
and , in a sign that the government is concerned the army might be split over reforms , Sergeyev said the ministry had canvassed opinions throughout the military . 
&quot; A genuine process of the consolidation of the will and practical actions of the armed forces to carry out the reform has begun . 
we regard this as one of the main conditions of achieving the aims of the reform , &quot; he said . 
the measures outlined by Sergeyev included : 
-- selling off commercial organisations such as suppliers 
-- cutting 300,000 civilian staff and reducing the armed forces to 1.2 million next year from their current level of around 1.5 million , with further cuts depending on political and economic circumstances 
-- consolidating branches of the rocket and air forces and reorganising the land forces 
-- streamlining central management by 2000 and cutting the number of military districts by combining them 
-- concentrating the best equipment in small , battle-ready units and investing in weapons research and development .
