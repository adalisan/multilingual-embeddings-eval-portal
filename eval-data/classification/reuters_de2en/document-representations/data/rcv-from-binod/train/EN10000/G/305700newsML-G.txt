Hong Kong &apos;s future leader Tung Chee-hwa said on Tuesday he expected to name the top officials of his administration by the end of this month . 
&quot; I will release the names and my recommendations and my decisions probably towards the end of January because that would be the time when I complete the process of interviews , &quot; Tung told reporters on Tuesday . 
Tung said he sought &quot; people with commitment to Hong Kong , very experienced and capable , good leaders , good communicators , and of course the residential qualifications needed under the Basic Law &quot; . 
under the Basic Law , Hong Kong &apos;s China-drawn future constitution , top officials may not have right of residence abroad , and several officials have given up foreign passports . 
Tung , chief executive-designate of the government that will take over Hong Kong after the British colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty at midnight of June 30 , has been interviewing all principal officials of the current administration . 
so far , only Chief Secretary Anson Chan , governor Chris Patten &apos;s number two , has been asked to stay on . 
Tung also hinted he might visit Washington in the near future to try to ease doubts there about Hong Kong &apos;s future as a part of China . 
&quot; It was suggested it would be helpful if I visited Washington earlier to explain the current development in Hong Kong . 
it was a very good suggestion and I would certainly take that into account in my planning , &quot; he said . 
Tung said he wanted to explain that people in Hong Kong were confident , and that China &apos;s promise to allow Hong Kong to keep its capitalist system and run its own affairs for 50 years after the handover would be kept . 
&quot; I ( want ) to explain to Washington what is happening here in Hong Kong and that there is a high degree of confidence here , and that &apos; one-country two-systems &apos; and &apos; a high degree of autonomy &apos; will prevail , &quot; he said . 
Tung &apos;s aides said last weekend that he was making plans to travel to major Western countries in a bid to raise Hong Kong &apos;s profile and clear the air over the transition of sovereignty .
