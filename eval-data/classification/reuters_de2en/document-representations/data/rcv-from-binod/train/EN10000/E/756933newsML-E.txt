a major economic rehabilitation package that Thailand plans to unveil on August 5 will include measures to stabilise the baht and cure ills in the finance and property sectors , government sources said on Friday . 
the seven-point plan , believed to be set in a white paper , would be discussed and approved by the cabinet on August 5 and announced on the same day , they told Reuters . 
the white paper would broadly include : 
- Policy initiatives to stabilise the shaky baht following its July 2 managed flotation by the authorities . 
- Fiscal measures to solve tight liquidity problems . 
- Initiatives to solve problems in the depressed and glutted property sector . 
- Measures to rehabilitate financial institutions . 
- Steps to speed up privatisation . 
- Fiscal measures to improve Thailand &apos;s industrial sector . 
- Measures on improving revenue collection . 
Thailand is going through its worst economic slump in more than a decade , which has dampened investor confidence in the country and its institutions . 
economists and analysts have been clamouring for the government to come up with a comprehensive plan to deal with the economic problems and urged it to seek IMF assistance . 
the baht has lost about 20 percent of its value since its de facto devaluation . 
it now hovers near the 32 baht per dollar level and hit a new record low of 32.70 on Thursday . 
the currency &apos;s slide has alarmed authorities and sparked high inflation fears . 
the deputy governor of the central bank , Chaiyawat Wibulsawasdi , told reporters that the 32 baht per dollar level was too low . 
another key measure in the white paper would be steps to overcome a severe liquidity problem that has gripped the nation as interest rates trend up , the government sources said . 
Thai lending rates at between 12.75-13.75 percent are among the highest in the region and have stifled business and manufacturing activity in the country . 
the white paper would also include fresh initiatives to solve maladies in the depressed and glutted property sector , the sources said . 
Thailand recently launched measures to set up a Property Loan Management Organisation to refinance the more viable projects of troubled firms indirectly . 
the government also offered below-market interest rates to first time house buyers to stimulate demand in the property market . 
another element in the white paper would be measures to rehabilitate the ailing financial sector , which is over exposed to the property sector and faces a major liquidity crunch , the government sources said . 
last month , the government suspended the operations of 16 weak finance firms and ordered them to merge or consolidate with five strong ones chosen by the authorities . 
the outcome of the exercise , for which the deadline was July 11 , is still unknown . 
market sentiment in Thailand &apos;s financial sector has been dampened by concerns about the level of their non-performing loans and doubts about their asset quality , analysts said . 
the white paper was also expected to touch on initiatives to speed up privatisation of Thai state enterprises , the government sources said . 
Thailand &apos;s severe economic downturn and a growing fiscal deficit , the first in 10 years , have nudged the government into reviving recently sluggish privatisation plans . 
other measures expected in the white paper were steps to improve competitiveness and restructure Thailand &apos;s industrial sector as well as to improve revenue collection as the economy slid , the sources said .
