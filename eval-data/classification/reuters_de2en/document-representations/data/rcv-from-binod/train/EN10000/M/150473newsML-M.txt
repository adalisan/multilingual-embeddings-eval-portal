the Zambia stock exchange wants to tap the savings of the country &apos;s football fans to attract interest in a market which has only three listed shares . 
Mumba Kapumpa , head of the Lusaka exchange , told the African Stock Exchanges Association , meeting in the Egyptian capital on Tuesday : &quot; We are trying to encourage various football clubs to float themselves ( on the exchange ) . 
&quot; Zambians are football fanatics . 
they will spend their last penny on watching their national team . 
club members could buy shares . 
Kapumpa , who is chief executive of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Zambia , told Reuters the exchange hoped to persuade the first club , probably Lusaka Football Club , to float by early next year . 
&quot; Football is virtually a religion . 
almost every football club has a very large membership . 
if clubs become public companies they can sell shares at very small amounts . 
that would bring in hundreds of thousands of kwacha , &quot; he said . 
his exchange is in need of a boost . 
figures from the Africa Stock Exchanges Association show that at mid-1996 it had only three listed companies , with a market capitalisation totalling $ 237 million . 
turnover in the first half of 1996 totalled 22.1 million shares , worth a total of only $ 140,000 . 
Kapumpa said he planned to increase turnover by also encouraging local governments to issue municipal bonds on the exchange , with maturities longer than a year . 
he is pressing the central government to cut the rate on treasury bills , now above 50 percent , to make the share market more attractive to investors . 
Kapumpa also wants the government to raise the minimum purchase amount for treasury bills to persuade small investors to turn to the stock market .
