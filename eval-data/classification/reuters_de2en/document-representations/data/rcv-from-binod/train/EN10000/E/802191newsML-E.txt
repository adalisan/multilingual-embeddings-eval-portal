Argentine Economy Minister Roque Fernandez on Friday said the government may be unable to reach an agreement on an IMF deal setting fiscal targets and structural reforms before the end of September . 
&quot; In principle we are continuing to work to see if we can reach an agreement by Hong Kong , but I cannot say that negotiations will be concluded by that date , &quot; Fernandez told reporters . 
the IMF , or International Monetary Fund , holds its annual conference in Hong Kong at the end of September . 
&quot; Officials from the government and the IMF are working with that objective , but we will have to see if everything can be done , &quot; Ferandez said . 
Argentina is negotiating for a three-year Extended Fund Facility ( EFF ) , which would kick in when the current stand-by agreement with the IMF expires at the end of the year . 
the EFF would stipulate structural reforms and set fiscal targets , while the stand-by agreement involves targets only . 
an article in the Friday editions of the daily Clarin referred to a report by an IMF economist that remarked on Argentina &apos;s high debt levels and high public expenditure . 
asked whether the talks with the IMF involve partial disembursements , Fernandez said , &quot; For me that is not a fundamental issue . 
&quot; When we talk about disbursements , we are talking about $ 150 million every quarter , and today the good access Argentina has in capital markets , every quarter or every six months , makes this figure insignificant , &quot; he said . 
Fernandez said the value of an EFF is that it provides for &quot; an open , transparent audit of macroeconomic projections . 
for us , that is what is important , not the disbursement . 
Fernandez confirmed that Argentina &apos;s growing trade deficit , which some analysts say could reach $ 3.0 billion this year , was an issue being discussed with the IMF . 
&quot; The issue is being discussed with the IMF , but I do not see it as a complicated issue that is at the center of the discussion , &quot; Fernandez said . 
Argentina &apos;s current stand-by accord with the IMF sets a fiscal deficit target of $ 3.0 billion for 1997 . 
the first-half deficit of $ 1.31 billion was less than the $ 1.4 billion target agreed with the IMF .
