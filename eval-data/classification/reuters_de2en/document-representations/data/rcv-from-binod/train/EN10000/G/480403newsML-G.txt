a United Nations human rights official on Tuesday denounced a deadly weekend grenade attack in Phnom Penh as an attempt to wipe out the leadership of the main opposition party . 
&quot; This was a clear attempt to assassinate the leadership of an opposition political party who was conducting a legal and peaceful political demonstration , &quot; said Thomas Hammerberg , special U.N. representative for Human Rights in Cambodia . 
Hammarberg , who said Khmer Nation Party ( KNP ) leader Sam Rainsy was the target of Sunday &apos;s attack outside parliament , added in a statement that he had &quot; serious concerns about the possibility of a serious , professional investigation in this matter &quot; . 
the U.N. official said he feared the killings and other violence had created an environment that could make the holding of free and fair elections next year much more difficult . 
Amnesty International , in a statement dated Monday , condemned the attack , saying : &quot; The incident appears to be part of a pattern of increasing political tension and violence , and is an extremely worrying development . 
the London-based human rights organisation said as many as 19 people had been killed and more than 100 injured by four grenade explosions . 
other reports have put the number of dead at anything from 14 to 20 , with Hammarberg citing a figure of at least 16 . 
Amnesty said it feared for the safety of the former finance minister Sam Rainsy , who narrowly escaped injury . 
meanwhile , shock turned to anger as Cambodians reflected on the tragedy . 
in markets and streets , people expressed outrage . 
at Wat Langka in the city centre , Sam Rainsy opened a book of condolences on Tuesday morning and received distraught relatives of those killed in the attack . 
the family members sat with the remains of six of the victims . 
many wept as they stared at the portraits of the victims on display , which were mounted in the centre of flowered wreaths . 
the six were Sam Rainsy &apos;s bodyguard , Han Mony , as well as a KNP member , three young women who were garment factory workers and a 13-year-old girl who had come to watch Sunday &apos;s rally . 
cremation services were to be held at Wat Langka on Wednesday .
