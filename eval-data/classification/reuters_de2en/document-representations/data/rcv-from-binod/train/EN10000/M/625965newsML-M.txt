mounting concerns over a possible left-wing victory in the second round of French elections on Sunday pushed BTP and Bund option volatilities up further on Friday , traders on LIFFE said . 
a week of turmoil over European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) has taken its toll on both the Italian and the German options markets with both positioning themselves for a slide in the underlying futures , traders said . 
&quot; The French election has focused all the EMU fears , and if the left gets in on Sunday there will be a shake-out , &quot; said a trader at a British brokerage on LIFFE . 
&quot; BTP Vol is looking expensive now , but with that kind of uncertainty would you want to sell it ? 
last week &apos;s first round of French polls put the left in the lead . 
put sellers dominated both BTP and Bund options pits , traders said . 
July Bund implied volatility on September futures was at 6.30 percent by 1056 GMT , up from 6.00 percent late Thursday , while August and September options were at 6.00 percent versus 5.80 percent on Thursday . 
December volatility was up 0.1 percentage point at 5.75 percent . 
September Bund futures were at 99.52 , up seven basis points on the day . 
in BTP options September volatility was trading at 8.70 percent , up from 8.60 percent on Thursday . 
traders noted that this was up from around 7.60 percent at the beginning of May . 
a European bank was a major buyer of at-the-money July Bund options following purchases of around 8,000 lots on Thursday by a U.S. house at the 98.00 strike . 
put strikes all the way down to 97.00 were proving attractive . 
&quot; locals don &apos;t want to be short over this weekend , &quot; said a French bank trader . 
&quot; usually they go short to catch the theta , but this weekend they certainly want to be flat . 
Theta is a measurement of the time decay in the value of an option . 
traders said Italian futures were fluctuating wildly but in thin trade . 
concern over a possible downgrade to Italy &apos;s ratings had added strength to volatility . 
but traders said it was a side issue compared with the French election . 
earlier IBCA , the European rating agency , said it had no intention of changing Italy &apos;s ratings . 
the Italian Treasury said Moody &apos;s and Standard and Poor &apos;s had also denied any plans to downgrade Italy . 
&quot; We are in the lovely position of not knowing if BTPs will be up a point of down a point on Monday morning , &quot; the French bank trader said .
