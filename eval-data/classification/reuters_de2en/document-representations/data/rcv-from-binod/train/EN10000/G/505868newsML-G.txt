a leading Nigerian human rights activist detained in Geneva last week said in Lagos on Monday he was beaten and tortured on false allegations of stealing . 
Clement Nwankwo , executive director of the Constitutional Rights Project , was detained by Geneva police while attending the United Nations human rights forum after two Swiss saleswomen accused him of stealing dresses . 
&quot; I was accused falsely by two persons who had no evidence , &quot; he told a news conference , adding : &quot; Swiss police on the basis of unsubstantiated evidence pounced on me on the street of Geneva , kicked , beat , handcuffed , tortured and locked me in jail for four days . 
Geneva police spokesman Emile Berthod has denied the Nigerian &apos;s allegations of ill treatment . 
Nigeria &apos;s mission in Geneva has protested over the incident to Swiss authorities , according to the official News Agency of Nigeria . 
Nwankwo said the Swiss government had , through its ambassador to the United Nations , Christian Dunant , apologised to him and also set up an inquiry . 
he said Dunant came to see him before he left Geneva and accompanied him to the airport . 
&quot; At the airport he took me to the VIP lounge from where we were chauffeur driven to the foot of the aircraft . 
he shook my hand and assured me that the report of the inquiry will be made public in the next few days , &quot; Nwankwo said . 
Nigeria &apos;s human rights community are planning a joint statement on the incident . 
U.N. sources and human rights activists in Geneva said Nwankwo was detained incommunicado . 
he was convicted of stealing and sentenced to 20 days in jail , which was suspended pending appeal . 
Nwankwo vehemently denied the charges .
