a House Republican leader said on Sunday that despite pending ethics violation action against House Speaker Newt Gingrich , support for his re-election remained strong . 
&quot; We have seen no erosion whatesoever , &quot; House Majority Whip Tom delay , a Texas Republican , said on NBC &apos;s &quot; meet the Press , &quot; and he predicted Gingrich &apos;s re-election on Jan . 7 . 
but Representative Martin Frost , a Texas Democratic appearing on the same show , saw it differently , forecasting Gingrich &apos;s ultimate resignation . 
&quot; When all is said and done , &quot; said Frost , chairman of his party &apos;s Congressional Campaign Committee , Republicans will demand that ethical standards be upheld &quot; and Newt eventually , on his own , will step down and there will be a new speaker . 
frost called for a public hearing by the House Ethics Committee on a penalty for Gingrich , but said it should not be rushed and held just ahead of the House vote . 
he said all the evidence should be presented and Gingrich , a Georgia Repubican who has been a lightning rod for House Democrats , be given a chance to reply . 
delay said he hoped the panel could meet before the vote , had no problem with a public hearing and was sure Gingrich would appear before it , if asked . 
Gingrich was cited by the panel for using money from a tax-exempt charitable organisation to finance a college course that was broadcast to conservative gatherings . 
the speaker has admitted he violated House rules and that in failing to get legal advice that would have steered him away from use of a tax-exempt foundation his conduct did not reflect creditably on the House . 
the ethics panel will decide on Gingrich &apos;s punishment , which could could range from a reprimand to expulsion . 
representative John Linder , a Georgia Republican , said on &quot; Fox News Sunday &quot; that &quot; We want public hearings , too . 
we &apos;d like them Thursday or Friday . 
ethics Committee chairman Nancy Johnson , a Connecticut Republican , said in an interview with the Washington Post that she wanted an early and public decision on the penalities , and hoped to have a timetable set by Monday . 
some Democrats have called for Gingrich to step down , but others are said to prefer he stay on grounds it would be easier for President Bill Clinton to deal with a weak speaker . 
Linder said : &quot; They want to keep this in the public eye as long as Clinton is being accused of laundering money , &quot; a reference to allegations that Democrats had accepted illegal campaign contributions . 
frost said : &quot; This is a matter of the integrity of the House &quot; and that the standards that were applied to former Speaker Jim Wright should be applied to Gingrich . 
in 1989 , Gingrich helped to bring down Wright as House Speaker on ethics charges . 
the Texan resigned voluntarily . 
Wright , on the ABC programme &quot; This Week , &quot; had no advice for Gingrich , but said that while he himself had done nothing wrong , the charges against him were polarising Congress . 
asked what Gingrich should do , Wright said &quot; he will have to examine his own conscience .
