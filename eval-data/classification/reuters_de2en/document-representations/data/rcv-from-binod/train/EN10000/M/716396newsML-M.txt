&quot; After panic selling over the past few days , some shares expected to post good results but at low price levels attracted buying , especially from domestic retail investors , &quot; she said . 
although sentiment had taken a slight turn for the better , brokers warned that B share market volume remained thin and said foreign investors had largely failed to join the crowd and buy on Wednesday .
