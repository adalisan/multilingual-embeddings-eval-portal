thousands of people filled the Mexican capital &apos;s main square early on Monday to celebrate the victory of left-wing opposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in the city &apos;s first election for mayor . 
they greeted the 63-year-old Cardenas with chants of &quot; Viva Cuauhtemoc &quot; when he appeared in the Zocalo square , where Aztec kings met Spanish conquerer Hernan Cortez in the 16th Century . 
&quot; Brothers and sisters , this is the people &apos;s victory , all Mexicans won , &quot; a smiling Cardenas told the crowd . 
supporters of Cardenas &apos; left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) waved giant yellow flags emblazoned with the party &apos;s symbol of an Aztec sun . 
on Mexico City &apos;s Reforma avenue , PRD supporters honked their horns and waved the party &apos;s banner . 
&quot; Now it is up to us to organise ourselves and run this city well to solve its problems , &quot; Cardenas told residents of an 18-million-strong city wracked by pollution and crime . 
following his speech , the crowd raised their arms in a sea of V-for-victory signs used by Cardenas since he narrowly lost the 1988 presidential race , a defeat he attributed to fraud . 
holding their arms aloft , the crowd sang Mexico &apos;s national anthem . 
some wept with joy . 
&quot; I &apos;m so happy , it &apos;s something that we have been waiting a long time for , &quot; said Arturo Cruz , 27 , draped in a yellow flag . 
it was the first time the inhabitants of Mexico City have been allowed to choose their mayor . 
for 68 years , the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party has appointed the mayor , an institution known as the &quot; dedazo , &quot; literally the pointing of a finger by the president . 
&quot; This is the people &apos;s dedazo , &quot; said 40-year-old Cardenas supporter Marcos Morales , holding up an ink-stained thumb to show he had voted earlier in the day . 
Cardenas , the son of a popular former president in the 1930s , has vowed to make fighting crime and corruption his top priorities in governing the city . 
a former pri state governor who left the party in disgust in the 1980s , he is also widely expected to use the post as a platform for his third presidential bid in 2000 . 
although his power over the city budget is restricted , the post is considered the second most important elected position in the country , after the president himself .
