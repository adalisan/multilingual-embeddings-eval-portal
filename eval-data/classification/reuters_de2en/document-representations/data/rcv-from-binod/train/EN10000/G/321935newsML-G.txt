President Jacques Chirac urged a panel of experts on Tuesday to weigh carefully proposals for reforming France &apos;s justice system to make the judiciary more independent and protect the presumption of innocence . 
Chirac sounded a note of caution on the central issue of cutting the umbilical cord between public prosecutors and the justice ministry , saying the full implications of such a move needed to be examined thoroughly . 
&quot; Our fellow citizens suspect the justice system is sometimes subject to government influence and does not sufficiently guarantee respect for individual liberties , particularly the right to be presumed innocent , &quot; the president said at a ceremony inaugurating a 21-member commission appointed on Monday . 
he said the body should study &quot; the consequences of a new situation in which the public prosecutor would no longer be subordinated to the justice minister and might even no longer be part of a hierarchy &quot; . 
the panel , headed by Supreme Court president Pierre Truche , has until July 15 to recommend ways of guaranteeing judicial independence , ensuring the legitimacy of the justice system and upholding the presumption of innocence . 
Chirac told the commission it should weigh both a more open system of investigating suspects and stricter secrecy . 
magistrates and lawyers generally welcomed Chirac &apos;s call for a far-reaching shake-up of the justice system , but some politicians questioned the wisdom of making prosecutors independent of the political authorities . 
Pierre Mazeaud , a senior jurist in Chirac &apos;s Gaullist RPR party and chairman of parliament &apos;s legal committee , said he was reassured that the president had not prejudged whether to break the link between prosecutors and the political authorities , which Mazeaud has warned could lead to &quot; government by judges &quot; . 
the Socialist opposition had mixed reactions . 
former culture minister Jack Lang , a law professor , said Chirac had launched a reform which the Socialists had long advocated . 
&quot; The president seems to be turning his back on his own ( Gaullist ) party &apos;s long tradition of tying up and domesticating the justice system , &quot; Lang told France Inter radio . 
&quot; Let &apos;s take him at his word and look to the future . 
but fellow Socialist Michel Sapin , a former junior justice minister , said Chirac &apos;s sudden interest in justice reform was suspicious at a time when magistrates were investigating alleged kickbacks to the RPR while he was mayor of Paris in 1977-95 . 
&quot; Difficult , complicated scandals with a potentially devastating political impact are ripening . 
so they are trying to create a windbreak , &quot; Sapin said . 
Senator Michel Charasse , a former senior aide to the late president Francois Mitterrand , said the former Socialist head of state had always opposed making the public prosecutor &apos;s office independent of the government . 
he quoted Mitterrand as having told his last cabinet meeting in 1995 : &quot; As an old man I speak to you with long experience of public life . 
it would menace the republic .
