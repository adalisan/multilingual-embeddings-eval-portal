Taiwan &apos;s Finance Ministry announced a &quot; two-into-one &quot; tax merger on Wednesday to boost investment and a slowing economy . 
finance Minister Paul Chiu said the ministry would merge the island &apos;s two income taxes into one business income tax of 25 percent . 
the merger would cut tax revenues by about T $ 26.8 billion ( US $ 975 million ) a year , but the ministry would recoup the loss by assessing a 10 percent levy on profits that enterprises reserve rather than distribute to shareholders immediately , Chiu said . 
&quot; The new tax system will avoid double taxation and will help corporate structures , &quot; Chiu told reporters . 
&quot; In fact , this is a tax reduction , &quot; Chiu said . 
&quot; It will encourage investment ( in Taiwan ) and increase our international competitiveness . 
Taiwan has been wooing multinationals to establish the island as a regional hub for Asia-Pacific operations by boosting local economic competitiveness . 
the tax reform needed parliamentary approval and could take effect in 1998 , the minister said . 
foreign nationals &apos; taxes were not affected because their maximum rate would remain the same at 40 percent , Chiu said . 
what the ministry has called a &quot; two-into-one &quot; tax merger is an accounting change that eliminates double taxation of companies &apos; profits and the dividends they pay to shareholders . 
maximum assessments on domestic individuals &apos; income will be capped at 40 percent , compared with the maximum 55 percent before the merger . 
currently , foreign investors &apos; income is taxed first by a 25 percent business income tax , and then a 20 percent dividend tax on the 75 percent untaxed part , making the rate 40 percent . 
economists said the tax reform would only encourage domestic investment , not foreign investment . 
&quot; Such a tax reduction reform will surely boost domestic investment , &quot; said Sun Ke-nan , a panel member from the prestigious Chunghua Institution for Economic Research . 
&quot; But we don &apos;t see any improvement on how to encourge foreign investment in the proposal , &quot; he said . 
&quot; In order to develop Taiwan into an Asia-Pacific financial centre , we may consider lowering the dividend tax on foreign investors to 15 percent from the current 20 percent , &quot; Sun said . 
foreign investors said they wanted more . 
&quot; The tax reform really doesn &apos;t benefit foreign corporations at all , because foreign investors still have to pay 20 percent in dividend tax , and that dampens investment interest a great deal , &quot; said Ken Sien , a partner at Price Waterhouse . 
&quot; The dividend tax tilts the playing field against foreigners . 
Taiwan must cancel that tax ... if it really wants to become an Asia-Pacific financial centre , &quot; Sien said . 
sun said the planned levy of 10 percent on enterprises &apos; reserved profits would discourage high-tech investments as they now enjoyed tax-free treatment of reserved profits of up to 200 percent of capitalisation .
