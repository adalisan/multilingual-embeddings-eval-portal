Taiwan &apos;s central bank said on Monday that the island &apos;s inflation growth rate would fall below three percent in 1997 as the impact of domestic oil price hikes was smaller than expected . 
the statement followed data released by the government statistics bureau which showed Taiwan &apos;s April consumer price index rose only 0.51 percent compared to April 1996 . 
&quot; The impact of price hikes was smaller than expected , and the whole year consumer price growth rate is expected to fall below an earlier projection of three percent , &quot; the bank said in a statement . 
state-run oil monopoly Chinese Petroleum Corp hiked domestic oil prices an average nine percent in January , followed by an additional 2.97 percent rise in April . 
but despite low inflation in April , local economists said the central bank was unlikely to further loosen monetary policy in case it accelerates capital outflows . 
the central bank was scheduled to hold its board meeting on Thursday .
