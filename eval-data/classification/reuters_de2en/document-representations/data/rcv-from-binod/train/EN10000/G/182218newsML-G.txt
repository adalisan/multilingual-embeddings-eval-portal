Russian officials and separatist delegates met on Tuesday to discuss how to rebuild the war-devastated southern region of Chechnya . 
Ivan Rybkin , President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s envoy to the rebel region , told a meeting of a joint commission of 39 Russian officials and 31 representatives of the rebel government that he had a comprehensive draft to discuss . 
&quot; There is a good basis for talks which should end with working out a joint document , &quot; Rybkin , who is also a secretary of Yeltsin &apos;s policy-making security council , told the meeting . 
&quot; This document should be signed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and ( separatist prime minister ) Aslan Maskhadov . 
Chechnya , an oil-rich land on the southern edge of the Russian Federation , was devastated in 21 months of fighting between Chechen rebels and Russian troops sent there in December 1994 to crush the region &apos;s independence movement . 
tens of thousands of people , mainly civilians , died in the fighting , which ended with a peace deal struck by Moscow with the rebels on August 31 . 
Rybkin made clear that Russia was not ready to foot the entire bill for reconstruction . 
&quot; When two are fighting in a china shop both have to be ready to pay for damage , &quot; Interfax quoted him as saying when he arrived in the regional capital Grozny . 
the peace deal postponed any decision on whether Chechnya should become independent by five years , and Russia pulled most of its troops from the region , leaving only two brigades there . 
the peace accord has brought Chechnya an uneasy peace , soured only by individual incidents . 
Interfax news agency said rebels shot at Russian border guards in the southern ethnic republic of Ingushetia late on Monday and set their armoured personnel carrier on fire . 
two Russian officers were lightly injured , it added . 
the rebels make little secret of the fact that they view the delay in decision-making as a face-saving excuse for Moscow to let Chechnya go . 
they have taken tight control of the region and scheduled elections for a regional leader and a new parliament for January 27 -- without consulting Moscow . 
Rybkin , effectively admitting that Moscow could do little about the election , said it should conform with Russian legislation and foreign observers should be invited . 
&quot; The polls are Chechnya &apos;s internal affair and we have a strong enough legal basis to hold them , &quot; Movladi Udugov , a senior member of separatist government , replied bluntly . 
Moscow has ruled out granting Chechnya full independence and top Kremlin officials hope the five-year delay will be enough to change the situation so that Chechnya finds it more attractive to stay in Russia than to secede . 
rebuilding plans have also led to arguments . 
some top Russian officials have suggested Moscow should invest in Chechnya reconstruction only after receiving assurances that the region would remain part of the Russian Federation , something the rebels bluntly reject . 
others say that if Russia does not help war-devastated Chechnya , anti-Russian sentiments would grow and the region would be even more reluctant to stay .
