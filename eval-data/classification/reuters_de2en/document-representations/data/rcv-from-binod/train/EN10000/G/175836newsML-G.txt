NATO said on Friday its peacekeeping troops are handing out &quot; Superman &quot; comic books in Serbo-Croat to teach Bosnian children about the dangers of mines littering the country &apos;s former front lines . 
some 130,000 comic books were delivered to Bosnia this week in a U.S.-funded programme to educate youth about mines , unexploded ammunition and booby traps , Major Nick Swain , a NATO spokesman , told reporters . 
the comic book , entitled &quot; deadly Legacy &quot; , features the man of steel swooping down to rescue two Bosnian children before they can start playing with an unexploded mortar . 
&quot; You should pay attention to shells and other military devices but you must not collect them , &quot; Superman warns the children . 
since fighting ended a year ago in Bosnia , the Serb , Moslem and Croat armies have been dragging their feet on pledges to begin removing the estimated three million mines left over from four years of war in former Yugoslavia . 
the NATO-led peace force has repeatedly appealed to Bosnia &apos;s rival armies to fulfil their commitments on de-mining , but the factions still appear reluctant to trust the peace agreed last November . 
Swain credited the wife of U.S. President Bill Clinton with helping to come up with the proposal for the $ 100,000 project . 
&quot; The idea for a mine awareness comic book was sparked by a comment by the First Lady during her visit to Bosnia earlier this year , &quot; Swain said . 
Hillary Clinton saw a colouring book for Bosnian kids and asked what was being done to educate older children about the mine problem , he said . 
UNICEF had suggested the comic book feature superwoman instead of Superman but that idea was rejected by the Bosnians , said spokesman Robert Fuderich . 
the comic book &apos;s ending may evoke a cynical response from children jaded by the devastating war . 
superman &apos;s parting words resemble Clinton administration warnings that American troops could not be deployed indefinitely to enforce the Bosnian peace treaty . 
&quot; People all over the world need my help .
