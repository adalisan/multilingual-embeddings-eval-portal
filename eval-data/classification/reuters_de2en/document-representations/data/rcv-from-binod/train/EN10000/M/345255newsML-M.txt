Taiwan &apos;s state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp ( CPC ) purchased just one 250,000 barrel cargo of 95-octane unleaded reformate in its March 1-15 buying tender at $ 27.60 per barrel cost and-freight ( c-and-f ) -- its highest award for some years , a company official said on Thursday . 
&quot; It is the highest .. we have never paid so high , &quot; the official said . 
&quot; We awarded just one cargo because the number is not good . 
the tender closed January 28 and was valid until January 30 . 
deliveries are to Keelung or Taichung . 
the official said CPC would emerge after the Chinese New Year in early February with a new tender for more March cargoes . 
CPC &apos;s last purchase of unleaded reformate was awarded at $ 27.00 per barrel c-and-f Keelung or Taichung for delivery February 11-28 to a Japanese trader .
