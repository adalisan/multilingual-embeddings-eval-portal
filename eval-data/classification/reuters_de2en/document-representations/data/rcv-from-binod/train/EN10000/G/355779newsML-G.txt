Indonesia has told local governments to restrict major public gatherings ahead of general elections in May in order to lower the risk of violence , the Jakarta Post reported on Tuesday . 
&quot; Governors , regents and mayors are ordered to postpone any meeting , congress or seminar organised by socio-political and mass organisations which involve a large crowd of people until after the election , &quot; the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement quoted by the newspaper . 
in recent months , several towns across Indonesia have been hit by ethnic and religious riots that analysts say were fuelled by frustrations with economic development and the growing gap between rich and poor . 
the statement said the order was made by Home Affairs Minister Yogie Memet in a circular distributed to all provincial and regency-level administrations . 
it said any activity that could incite social unrest and disturb public order should be postponed , and the restrictions should be observed in particular from one week before the election campaign period to one week after polling day . 
the official campaign period from April 27 to May 23 is followed by a five-day cooling-off time before the poll on May 29 . 
three sanctioned political organisations -- the ruling Golkar , the Moslem-oriented United Development Party ( PPP ) and the Indonesian Democratic Party ( PDI ) -- will contest 425 of the 500 seats in the House of Representatives . 
the armed forces , who do not vote , are allocated 75 seats .
