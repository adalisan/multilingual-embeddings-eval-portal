suspected Corsican separatists bombed the home of the mayor of the northern town of Bastia on Monday in the latest in a spate of attacks defying a French government crackdown on the Mediterranean island . 
the blast , of about 300 grams ( 10 Oz ) of explosives , blew out the door of the apartment of Emile Zuccarelli , a former cabinet minister who is mayor of Bastia and opposition member of the National Assembly for the small Radical Socialist party . 
the early morning explosion also damaged the stairwell in the building . 
no one was hurt and Zuccarelli was not at home at the time . 
no one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast , which bore the hallmarks of Corsican guerrillas who are waging a bombing campaign in defiance of repeated promises by conservative Prime Minister Alain Juppe to clamp down . 
shortly after midnight , suspected separatists sprayed gunfire at a paramilitary gendarme office in the northeastern town of Vescovato from a passing car . 
police found 13 bullet holes in the building . 
no one was hurt in the fourth such attack on a gendarmerie target in as many nights . 
separatists have been waging a low-level campaign of bombings and attacks for two decades in a bid to secure greater autonomy for Corsica from Paris . 
Juppe vowed anew to crack down after the &quot; historic wing &quot; of the Corsican National Liberation Front last month bombed City Hall in Bordeaux , where Juppe is mayor .
