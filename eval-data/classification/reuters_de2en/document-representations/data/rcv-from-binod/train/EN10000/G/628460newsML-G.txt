Ivan Gotti has given Italy new hope in the Giro d &apos;Italia but he was the forgotten contender when the race opened two weeks ago in Venice . 
&quot; No one took me seriously . 
they did not invite me to the pre-race press conference with the other leading hopes , &quot; he said after pulling on the pink jersey of Giro race leader on Saturday . 
&quot; Then they thought the Giro was finished for Italy because Marco Pantani was out but I showed them what was possible . 
it took Gotti six years to score his first professional victory when he won a Giro stage at Aprica last year . 
however , he has felt the glow of glory . 
in the 1995 Tour de France he spent two days in the yellow jersey of leader . 
in the past he has been the work-horse for Giro winners Gianni Bugno and Russian Yevgeny Berzin . 
but this year the rider from San Pellegrino is the leader of his team . 
the four victories of team mate Mario Cipollini took Giro minds off Gotti &apos;s potential until Saturday and Italy &apos;s focus had been on Pantani until he crashed out a week ago . 
&quot; This year my convictions are stronger and I have a better team , &quot; said Gotti who was fifth in the 1996 Giro . 
&quot; In the past I did not believe in myself and neither did anyone else . 
on Saturday his name was on the lips of thousands and splashed in pink paint along the final kilometres to this high-point in his career .
