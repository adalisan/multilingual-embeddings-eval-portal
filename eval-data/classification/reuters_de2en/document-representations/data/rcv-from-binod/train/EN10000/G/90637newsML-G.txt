Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands went for a walkabout on Wednesday in a deprived black South African township and was shown what locals hope is a sign of a brighter future for apartheid &apos;s victims . 
the queen of one of South Africa &apos;s former colonial powers toured a housing project hoping to bring new low-cost homes to hundreds of residents of Vosloorus , a rough satellite town near Johannesburg . 
she was on the third day of a four-day state visit , the first by a Dutch head of state , which puts the royal seal of approval on the two countries &apos; reconciliation after four decades of apartheid . 
she heads to Cape Town on Thursday .
