Robusta coffee futures closed mixed on Tuesday with January and some other nearby months rebounding from early lows on fund and trade short-covering . 
traders said the slight gains also reflected a moderate recovery in the deferred March and May positions in New York . 
London prices were earlier weighed by hedge selling . 
but the selling pressure eased slightly in the afternoon . 
but the day &apos;s volume of 3,238 lots was far from impressive , one trader said . 
by the finish , most-active January was $ 18 higher at $ 1,448 , just off the day &apos;s high of $ 1,449 . 
the benchmark contract had dipped to a low of $ 1,415 but good roaster buying helped pull January back from the low , which now formed an immediate support level . 
new York &apos;s spot December contract , which commanded a large premium to March over the past weeks , continued to weaken ahead of the first notice day in a week &apos;s time . 
the closely-watched Dec / March spread narrowed further to near 8.00 cents a lb at one stage in early trading from Monday &apos;s close of 10.85 cents . 
&quot; The specs are liquidating , rolling out of the December position into March ahead of the first notice day on the 19th , &quot; said one London trader . 
new York &apos;s Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange said late on Monday that 1,250 60-kg bags of coffee were pending grading at its warehouses . 
traders said the news which came after the market was closed had no impact , with one saying that the volume was still too small to scare the market off . 
&quot; ( It ) does not represent any real sign that the threat of a squeeze on the ( CSCE ) December contract had been averted , &quot; broker GNI said in its daily market commentary . 
news that Brazil exported 1.89 million bags of coffee in October -- the highest volume since September 1993 -- was within expectations and had no market impact .
