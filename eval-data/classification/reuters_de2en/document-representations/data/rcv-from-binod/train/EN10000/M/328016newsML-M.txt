Egyptian shares made it to a fifth straight record close on Thursday but the boom lost some of its momentum and investors looked more selective about stock in the dominant milling and cement sectors . 
the Capital Market Authority all-share index rose 0.9 percent to close at 355.31 points , from 352.08 on Wednesday . 
turnover was a moderate 55.19 million pounds ( $ 16.2 million ) . 
brokers said they thought the surge in prices would continue for some time , with occasional corrections . 
&quot; It has a long way to go , &quot; said Ali el-Tahri of EFG Hermes . 
&quot; Our market is still relatively cheap . 
Minister of State Youssef Boutors-Ghali told Reuters he expected all Egyptian variables to converge towards global norms , including the stock exchange &apos;s attractive P / E ratios . 
but in Thursday &apos;s session three of the partially privatised milling firms fell in price and cements , a mainstay of the Egyptian exhange for years , closed mixed . 
big gains in Medinet Nasr Housing and Development , PACHIN / paints and Chemical Industries , fertiliser firm Egyptian Financial and Industrial and General silos and Storage helped to make up the difference . 
Medinet Nasr , a star performer since privatisation last May , jumped 15.00 pounds to 423.00 in heavy trade . 
silos and Storage , privatised at 39.00 in November , made its own record close at 70.00 pounds , and PACHIN surged 6.00 to end the week at 133.10 . 
but Helwan Portland cement , the most active share of the session , closed 3.00 pounds down at 75.50 . 
both Amriyah cement and Egyptian Tora Portland cement ended unchanged , at 78.00 and 95.00 . 
Fund manager Farid Ibrahim of National Bank of Egypt said foreign demand for shares remained strong and he thought it would continue to be a good year . 
&quot; There may be corrections for a short period but not for long , &quot; he added . 
the index for openly traded firms rose to 580.24 from 572.39 points on Wednesday and the index for rarely traded &quot; closed &quot; firms also rose , to 237.50 from 236.03 . 
out of the 69 shares traded , 38 gained , 12 lost and 19 ended the day unchanged .
