Manila stocks ended sharply lower in thin trade on Monday on selling triggered by the Dow Jones &apos; drop on Friday , brokers said . 
&quot; The market had not fully reacted ( to Greenspan &apos;s comment ) last Friday and we see an extension today , &quot; said Norman Cruz , trader at Philippine Asia Equity . 
the Dow Jones dropped by 55.16 points to 6,381.94 points on Friday while the Philippine composite index slipped by 23.88 points to 3,139.45 . 
all sectors fell with losers beating gainers 90 to 30 with 60 issues unchanged . 
&quot; The thin volumes indicate there was no total sell-off so the market is not really that depressed . 
the market &apos;s performance tomorrow will depend on how the Dow will perform tonight , &quot; said Allan Araullo , Regina Capital Development Corp vice-president .
