the dollar surged to its highest level against the yen for more than four years on Monday while stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic strode higher , putting recent pessimism behind them . 
oil prices recovered a little after plunging nearly nine percent last week but traders said further losses were likely in the short term due to heavy supplies . 
gold , meanwhile , recovered lost ground as delays in Russian shipments boosted precious metals generally . 
on the currency market , the dollar , adding to earlier gains in Asian business , was up around 1.50 yen and three pfennigs from last week &apos;s late European levels by mid-afternoon . 
prospects of further increases in American interest rates and comments by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin that a firm dollar was good for the U.S. economy helped give the U.S. currency a solid boost . 
&quot; It seems fairly plain that there will be at least one more rise in U.S. interest rates at a time when real rates in Japan are set to turn negative , &quot; said Julian Fisher , economist at Daiwa Europe . 
repatriation of Japanese assets at the end of the financial year has passed and the focus has shifted to potential diversification by Japanese investors in the new year , he said . 
news that Japan &apos;s current account balance of payments surplus , a key source of trade friction with Washington , had widened again in February caused little concern . 
analysts said dollar bulls had been encouraged by the lack of acrimony during Rubin &apos;s visit to Japan last week when he again criticised Japan &apos;s ballooning trade surplus . 
&quot; The market was geared up for Rubin to talk a bit tougher on trade policy , &quot; said Nick Parsons , foreign exchange strategist at Banque Paribas . 
on Monday , now in Hanoi , Rubin commented : &quot; I think that the strength of the dollar that we &apos;ve had for quite some time now has spurred low interest rates , low rates of inflation ... in the United States . 
the dollar has risen steadily since hitting a post-war low just under 80 yen two years ago . 
it advanced well above 1.70 marks on Monday , helped by progress at a weekend meeting of European Union finance ministers towards launching the single euro currency , which would replace the mark . 
the German currency also weakened against other European units due to renewed optimism on European economic and monetary union ( EMU ) being launched as planned in 1999 . 
it slipped to 984.37 lire from 990.83 late on Friday and to 84.46 pesetas from 84.52 . 
but some uncertainty seemed to remain -- enough to make German Finance Minster Theo Waigel counter press reports that he had softened his stance on the budget deficit criterion for EMU . 
he insisted that he opposed looser interpretation of the rule . 
European stock markets were already in a positive mood before the New York market reopened higher , celebrating a recovery on Wall Street on Friday and the strength of the dollar -- good news for Europe &apos;s exporters . 
by mid-afternoon , Frankfurt had gained three percent and Paris nearly 2.5 percent , while London , Europe &apos;s biggest stock market , was up a more moderate 0.85 percent . 
on Wall Street , the Dow Jones industrial average was more than 40 points or 0.6 percent higher after an hour of trading to add to the 48.72 points it reclaimed on Friday . 
the German share market confounded expectations to book sharp gains . 
traders said rumours of the death of the bull run seemed somewhat exaggerated right now . 
&quot; What we are seeing is the typical short squeeze , &quot; said one trader . 
some London analysts said concern over higher interest rates and the British election on May 1 were keeping a lid on trading , while recent gains in the FTSE 100 index could be just a short-term reaction to an oversold position . 
but for the next couple of days we could see a technical bounce , &quot; said Kirit Shah , strategist at Sanwa International . 
French shares won back ground lost last week , aided by the rise on Wall Street and the higher dollar . 
the Dutch , Italian , Spanish , Swedish and Swiss bourses were also up around two percent or more . 
the dollar was quoted around 1.7090 marks and 125.70 yen , up from 1.6768 and 124.23 in late European trade on Friday . 
London futures for benchmark North Sea Brent blend crude had gained 39 cents to $ 18.07 a barrel after last week &apos;s $ 1.70 slide and losses of $ 6.50 so far this year . 
gold was fixed at $ 349 an ounce in the afternoon , up from the morning fixing of $ 347.85 and previous London close of $ 347.45 , but later slipped to around $ 348.50 . 
silver added seven cents to $ 4.80 and platinum $ 3 to $ 366 .
