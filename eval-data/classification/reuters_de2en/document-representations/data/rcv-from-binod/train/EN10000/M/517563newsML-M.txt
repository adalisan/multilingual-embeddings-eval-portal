U.S. Plains feedlot cattle trading was slow Thursday , with not enough sold for a market test , feedlot sources said . 
most showlists were depleted by midday Wednesday following two days of active trading at $ 69.00 per cwt , up $ 2.00 from the bulk of last week &apos;s sales , they said . 
about 300 steers that would likely grade select , with a few choice sold in the Texas Panhandle at $ 68.00 . 
several feedlot sources said the sales were of lower quality and lighter weights than the cattle that traded this week at $ 69.00 and were not indicative of the market . 
sales in Kansas totaled about 1,500 steers , also at $ 68.00 , which feedlot sources said were lighter than the bulk of steers sold this week and would probably grade mostly select . 
fed cattle prices , however , were seen vulnerable to belief the market was near a top and expectations that Friday &apos;s monthly USDA Cattle-On-Feed report would show hefty supplies of cattle on feedlots , market osurces said . 
analysts &apos; expectations for on-feed supplies as of April 1 averaged 107.6 percent of a year ago . 
estimates for March placements averaged 103.3 percent and marketings 100.6 percent .
