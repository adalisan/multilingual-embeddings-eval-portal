NWE gas oil faced a choppy day on Tuesday with a roller coaster in futures making some physical buyers cautious . 
may IPE gas oil finally closed $ 1.50 a tonne lower at $ 163.75 , just off the low of $ 163.00 and some way from the intra-day high of $ 167.00 . 
the erratic tone of the futures market was slowing demand in a market viewed by many as balanced . 
&quot; There has been very little done over recent days that it &apos;s hard to put a level at , &quot; said one trader . 
diesel was quieter with a small Russian 0.05 parcel heard sold into Hamburg at a strong mean of means + $ 9.75 . 
&quot; It is tight for diesel , so it &apos;s not lost any strength in this quiet market , &quot; said one dealer . 
barge activity was hit by high freight costs and volatile futures . 
&quot; It could easily change overnight , &quot; said one trader . 
Rotterdam refinery heating oil barges were done at May IPE + 50 cents , but trades were also done either side of this number depending upon the time of day .
