Tony Delk hit a game-tying three-pointer with five seconds left in regulation and Glen Rice scored five of his 42 points in overtime as the Charlotte hornets beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 110-105 Monday . 
&quot; It was really a good win , &quot; said hornets coach Dave Cowens . 
a Terrell Brandon jumper put the Cavs up 96-92 with 43 seconds to go in the fourth quarter but Rice hit a three-pointer 18 seconds later to cut the lead to one point . 
Danny ferry answered with two free throws with 12 seconds left , but Delk took the halfcourt inbounds pass , worked around a screen by Malik Rose and hit the tying three-pointer . 
&quot; It was a play designed for me to penetrate and then try to dish to Glen ( Rice ) , but the defender went up under the screen and that left me wide open so I just took the shot , &quot; said Delk . 
Brandon was called for travelling on Cleveland &apos;s next possession and Ricky Pierce missed a long three-pointer at the buzzer . 
Charlotte outscored Cleveland 12-7 in overtime . 
&quot; I think we were a little more aggressive in the overtime , &quot; said Rice .

the Cavs allowed a season high in points and lost for the first time in 14 games when scoring 100 or more points . 
&quot; Glen Rice was superb tonight and I thought Tony Delk came in and helped turn the game around , &quot; said Cavs coach Mike Fratello . 
&quot; We had too many breakdowns and too many mistakes mentally and physically . 
to be honest , they deserved to win the game in the end .
