Jakarta shares closed lower on Wednesday on profit-taking as announcement of a rise in Telkom &apos;s nine-month net profit failed to boost sentiment , brokers said . 
brokers said the market was likely to stay weak on Thursday as profit-taking was likely to continue in some big-capitalised stocks and the focus was seen remaining on newly-listed BNI . 
the Jakarta composite index fell 5.96 points , or 0.95 percent , to end at 620.27 points . 
Decliners led advancers by 57 to 51 and 74 issues were unchanged . 
brokers said Telkom &apos;s nine-month results failed to have much impact as it closed 25 rupiah lower at 3,925 rupiah . 
&quot; The announcement failed to have much impact as the results were within expectations , &quot; one foreign broker said . 
Telkom said it posted a net profit of 1.13 trillion rupiah in the first nine months of 1996 against 878.4 billion rupiah in the same period last year . 
BNI was the most active , with some 6.3 million shares changing hands . 
it ended 25 rupiah higher at 1,175 rupiah . 
brokers said other big-capitalised stocks Barito Pacific , Sampoerna , semen Gresik , Indosat , Astra and Bimantara were among the losers due to profit-taking . 
Second-liner general trading firm Aneka Kimia was among the most active on talk of a possible acquisition , one broker said . 
company officials were not immediately available for comment . 
another broker , however , said Aneka &apos;s rise was due to an expected strengthening of its fundamentals . 
Aneka rose 100 rupiah to close at 1,450 rupiah , with around 4.7 million shares changing hands .
