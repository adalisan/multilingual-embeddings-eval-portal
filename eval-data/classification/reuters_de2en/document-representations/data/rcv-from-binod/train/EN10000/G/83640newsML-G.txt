leaders from South Africa &apos;s two main rival black parties made a rare joint appearance at a rally in the troubled KwaZulu-Natal province on Sunday , urging people to end bloodshed between the two groups . 
the call was issued by Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and African National Congress national chairman Jacob Zuma at a ceremony commemorating the 1828 assassination of King Shaka -- regarded by many Zulus as the founder of their nation . 
&quot; We need to work hard ... to unite this nation so that there could be peace , &quot; Zuma told the about 30,000 Zulus gathered at King Shaka &apos;s tomb in Stanger on the Indian Ocean coast north of Durban . 
about 15,000 people have been killed in the province over the last decade in fighting fuelled by rivalry between Inkatha and President Nelson Mandela &apos;s ANC . 
Inkatha has majority support in KwaZulu-Natal . 
&quot; Peace is the key to achieving a strong and a prosperous nation . 
if we do something contrary to peace we will be burying ourselves alive as a nation , &quot; Zuma said . 
Buthelezi called on South Africa Zulus to look deep within themselves and &quot; expose the cancer of various conflicts within our nation &quot; . 
&quot; We must seek our national reconciliation as Zulus , so as to finally bring together that which has been for so long divided , &quot; he said to applause from crowd .
