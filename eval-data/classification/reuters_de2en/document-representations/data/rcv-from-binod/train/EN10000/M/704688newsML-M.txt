the early zloty eased against the basket of currencies and was seen losing more ground as foreign investors would sell Polish paper after the central bank said the likelyhood of a rate rise was growing , dealers said . 
&quot; After the central bank statement foreign players are likely to close their fixed interest Polish positions , &quot; said Malgorzata Sawicka of Bank Handlowy SA . 
NBP president Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz told the Gazeta Wyborcza daily that next year &apos;s planned budget deficit of 1.9 percent , instead of a balanced budget , made a rate rise more likely because of the need to cool domestic demand . 
at 0810 GMT the zloty was at 0.80 / 0.75 percent above the trading band centre against 1.11 / 1.02 at opening . 
it was at 3.2955 / 66 against the dollar and 1.8788 / 00 against the mark from 3.2775 / 95 and 1.8735 / 55 at opening respectively . 
dealers said , however , foreign zloty-selling was likely to be gentle and gradual , with the level of 0.5 percent above parity rate providing strong support for the Polish unit . 
on the money market two- and three-month rate rose 0.3 point at bid to 22.50 percent on the NBP statement . 
one-day rates rose 0.2 point to 23.15 / 23.55 percent but dealers said it had more to do with liquidity than a potential rate rise .
