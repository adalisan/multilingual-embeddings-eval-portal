when Tony Adams emerged from Arsenal &apos;s training ground on Saturday , stopped to address a crowd of reporters , and calmly admitted to being an alcoholic , he added another chapter to the extraordinary recent history of Arsenal Football Club . 
in the five years since the London giants lifted their 10th English championship title , their public identity has changed beyond recognition . 
plagued by shady financial deals and boardroom bickering , top players confessing to wild drug and alcohol binges , the club that always stood for respectability and high moral standards is mired in its deepest crisis yet . 
on Saturday , former England captain Adams , a rock at the heart of Arsenal &apos;s since he joined the club as an apprentice , came clean about his drink problem . 
just 24 hours earlier , caretaker-manager Stewart Houston walked out on the club after a month in charge , exiting as abruptly as Bruce Rioch , ruthlessly sacked by the Arsenal board five days before the current season started . 
in early August it was charges of tax evasion . 
in early 1995 it was illegal payments from transfer deals -- and so the list goes on . 
cracks first started appearing in the imposing Arsenal facade in 1990 , when Adams was jailed for drink-driving after skidding his car down the length of a residential street and smashing it into a wall . 
three years later Adams was in trouble again , needing 29 stitches in a head wound after falling down the steps of a night club , but the incident was dismissed as an unfortunate accident . 
later that year he was involved with a team mate in an incident at a pizza restaurant when customers were sprayed with a fire extinguisher . 
but throughout it all Adams &apos;s record on the pitch remained impressive , leading Arsenal to two league championships , two league cup victories , an F.A. 
Cup final triumph and success in the European Cup Winners &apos; Cup . 
in 1994 , the spotlight turned on his team mate Paul Merson , who broke down in tears and revealed an astonishing lifestyle outside soccer of cocaine addiction , alcohol addiction and compulsive gambling . 
midfielder David Hillier lowered the club &apos;s image further when he was fined for stealing luggage at Gatwick Airport , and another midfielder Ray parlour was fined after a fight with a Hong Kong cabbie on a club tour . 
like Adams , other Arsenal players have landed in the dock for drink-driving . 
striker Kevin Campbell , Scottish international Charlie Nicholas and Merson have all been prosecuted . 
five players were fined and sent home from a club holiday after a drinking session before a 1990 game against Norwich . 
then in 1995 , Arsenal manager George Graham was sacked by the club for accepting pay-offs from transfer deals , and was subsequently banned from football for a year . 
everything Arsenal touched turned to scandal . 
for most English soccer fans though , the shock is not so much that this litany of personal tragedies , bust-ups and financial scandals should have befallen a big premier league club -- but that it should have befallen Arsenal . 
formed by workers at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich , southeast London , 110 years ago , they moved north to Highbury in 1913 and dropped the epithet &quot; Royal &quot; from their name without ever losing the aire of regality . 
since the 1930s , when the Gunners dominated the English game under Herbert Chapman , Arsenal has been a by-word for gentlemanly decorum in a sport still regarded by some as the vulgar concern of the masses . 
while neighbours and arch-rivals Tottenham became embroiled in high-profile power-struggles and a stock market flotation , Highbury remained the haunt of gentleman amateurs . 
club chairman Peter Hill-Wood is from the old school of football management , educated at top private school Eton . 
Director Danny Fiszman , who owns the largest slice of shares at the club , is a successful London diamond merchant . 
the club lives comfortably in their stylish Art DECO stadium in a relatively affluent area of North London . 
arsenal now await the arrival of former Monaco manager Arsene Wenger -- the man chosen as long-term successor to Rioch -- hoping his tenure will mark an upturn in the club &apos;s chequered fortunes .
