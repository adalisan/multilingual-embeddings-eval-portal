a South African judge on Thursday acquitted six blacks of carrying out a 1987 political massacre for which former defence minister Magnus Malan is accused of being ultimately responsible . 
the six filed out of the colonial-style Courthouse in Durban with beaming smiles . 
supporters in the public gallery erupted in cheers . 
&quot; accused number one to six have not been proved guilty of the offences charged , they have been acquitted , &quot; Judge Jan Hugo told a packed court . 
Hugo has yet to deliver his verdict against Malan himself and eight others also charged with the murder of 13 blacks in KwaMakutha settlement near Durban . 
the six acquitted were members of the police force of the KwaZulu-Natal black homeland run by Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi until it was scrapped after all-race elections in April 1994 . 
they were alleged to have been the gunmen who carried out the attack , aimed at a member of the rival African National Congress who was not at home at the time . 
Hugo said the two key state witnesses against them had been liars and unreliable . 
he said the state had also failed to prove a lesser charge against them , that of conspiracy to murder . 
Malan , the most senior figure from the old white regime to be charged with atrocities against political opponents , sat in court in Durban with 15 others , including army generals , accused with him of ordering or carrying out the 1987 massacre . 
Hugo said some evidence supported the defence view that Malan and apartheid &apos;s generals had no links with the attack they called a &quot; frolic &quot; that was run solely by Johan Opperman . 
Opperman and two other military officers testified in the hope of avoiding prosecution . 
the judge said Opperman &apos;s contradictory claims in court went &quot; some way towards the view that the military neither planned nor approved the attack &quot; . 
the judge attacked the prosecution case , saying some evidence was misleading -- &quot; probably deliberately &quot; -- and that surprisingly few witnesses had been called who might have been able to back up claims by Opperman and the other two key witnesses . 
the court had to be aware that the three were &quot; self- confessed criminals who are trying to get some benefits by testifying ... red lights must necessarily start flashing &quot; , Hugo said . 
&quot; We would have greatly doubted their veracity , even if they were not accomplices , &quot; he added . 
the defendants joked and looked relaxed .
