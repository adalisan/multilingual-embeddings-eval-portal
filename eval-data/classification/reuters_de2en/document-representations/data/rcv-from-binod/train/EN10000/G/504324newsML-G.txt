calm returned on Friday to riot-hit towns on Indonesia &apos;s main Java island , a region the military described as violence-prone , residents and the official Antara news agency said . 
Antara quoted Major-General Soebagyo , the military commander for Central Java province , as saying the area &apos;s demographic characteristics made it prone to violence . 
it did not give details . 
the comments were believed to be a reference to the high population density in the region and the sharply-defined political loyalties among its people . 
at least four towns in Central Java have been rocked by violence in the past two weeks , with recurring clashes between supporters of the Moslem-oriented United Development Party ( PPP ) and the ruling Golkar party . 
riots broke out in the coastal town of Pekalongan , a PPP stronghold , two weeks ago after reports that a popular folk singer who has campaigned for the PPP in the past would be a Golkar candidate in the May 29 general elections . 
the latest violence erupted on Wednesday in the town of Wonosobo , also in central Java , and in the neighbouring town of Banjaranegara . 
at least three government offices , 11 vehicles and dozens of homes were damaged and 14 people injured in Wonosobo in clashes between PPP and Golkar supporters . 
residents said the area was peaceful on Friday . 
&quot; The city is calm today . 
I don &apos;t see any troops stationed in the town centre like yesterday and Wednesday , &quot; one resident told Reuters from Wonosobo , 350 km ( 215 miles ) southeast of Jakarta . 
armed forces commander General Feisal Tanjung said last month authorities would deal harshly with people who attempted to disrupt the election process . 
the formal campaign for the polls begins on April 27 . 
Golkar is certain to win this year &apos;s polls easily , but party leaders have said they want to increase the votes in their favour to above 70 percent .
