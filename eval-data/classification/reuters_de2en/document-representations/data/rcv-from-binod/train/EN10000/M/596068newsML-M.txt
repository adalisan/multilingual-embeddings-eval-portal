the dollar recovered against the yen in late Tokyo on Monday , after falling as low as 114.85 yen in early trade on a sharp rise in Japan &apos;s trade surplus and then quickly recovering due to strong buying from U.S. funds . 
the greenback climbed to as high as 116.10 yen after 0630 GMT due to short-covering and mark / yen purchases in cross trade after a lull of activity in afternoon trade , dealers said . 
data released early on Monday showed Japan &apos;s overall customs-cleared trade surplus grew 163.7 percent to 831.48 billion yen in April . 
the surplus with the U.S. , which has been grumbling about a growing bilateral trade imbalance , soared 174.1 percent from a year earlier to 468.97 billion yen . 
dealers said although large rises in Japan &apos;s trade surplus had been anticipated , traders in Tokyo took the data as a good reason for selling off dollars amid bearish sentiment carried over from last week . 
but such attempts to push the dollar lower proved futile as U.S. funds aggressively moved to snap up dollars in large amounts . 
the dollar quickly turned back after seeing a brief fall below 115 yen , making attempts to push it through that point in vain again , said a European bank dealer . 
U.S. funds &apos; purchases may have been based on expectations that the dollar would rebound to around 117 yen , since factors such as the wide U.S.-Japan interest rate gap have not changed yet , said a senior trader at a Japanese bank . 
but it is uncertain whether such buying positions will get the benefit of a rise in the dollar , since Japanese exporters and investors , who had not sold the dollar sufficiently on last week &apos;s dives , are keen to sell it above 116.50 yen , he added . 
&quot; The dollar is holding steady now , but its stability looks fragile , &quot; said a chief dealer at a city bank . 
&quot; There is a risk that the dollar will sink below 115 yen again , &quot; he added . 
Japanese exporters who did not arrange enough forward dollar sales for the July-September period were willing to sell above 116.50 yen amid fears that the dollar may slip as low as 112.00 yen in the medium term , dealers said . 
market attention has been on the Federal Reserve &apos;s policy-setting meeting on Tuesday as the next likely source of clues to the dollar &apos;s near-term direction . 
about 60 percent of participants in Tokyo expect the Fed to put its policy on hold . 
some traders were bearish about the dollar &apos;s outlook regardless of the outcome of the Fed &apos;s policy meeting . 
&quot; Even if the U.S. decides to raise rates , that may not have a lasting impact in pushing the dollar up because perceptions may also grow that there will be no further rise in U.S. interest rates , &quot; said a European bank trader . 
the dollar also firmed against the mark in tandem with the its gains against the yen , while the mark was boosted against the yen in cross trade primarily due to short-covering . 
it was at 68.56 yen at 0733 GMT , up from 68.12 yen in early trade .
