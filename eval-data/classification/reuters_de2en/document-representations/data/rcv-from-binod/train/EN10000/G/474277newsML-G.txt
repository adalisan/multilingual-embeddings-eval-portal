China broadened its defence on Friday in the controversy surrounding alleged illegal payments to the U.S. Democratic Party , denying that prominent Beijing business groups were involved . 
only hours after U.S. Vice President Al Gore wound up a fence-mending visit to China , the official Xinhua news agency lashed out at the American media , saying accusations of involvement by the three Chinese organisations were aimed at obstructing Sino-U.S. ties . 
&quot; The essence of China &apos;s so-called involvement in &quot; political donations &apos; is that a handful of people attempt to place new obstacles and undermine the development of Sino-U.S. relations by taking advantage of some anti-China forces and news media in the United States , &quot; Xinhua said . 
it did not name any of the &quot; anti-China forces &quot; or media . 
in the past , Beijing has denied the Chinese government was involved , apparently leaving open the possibility of freelance donations . 
but the Xinhua statement was aimed at deflecting accusations that three well connected business groups had any role either . 
Xinhua quoted Wang Jun , chairman of the China International Trust and Investment Corp ( CITIC , ) as saying the U.S. media had recently fabricated slanderous stories about CITIC and himself . 
Wang said he visited the United States in February last year at the invitation of investment bankers Lehman Brothers on a trip aimed at understanding the U.S. bond market . 
he said he met President Clinton in a large and informal gathering during the trip but business was not discussed . 
the agency also quoted Ma Zehua of the state-run China Ocean Shipping Company as saying that any allegation of involvement by the company was groundless vilification . 
&quot; We lodge a strong protest and reserve the right to take any measures to protect the interests of the company against any harm , &quot; Ma said . 
both companies have listed affiliates in Hong Kong and are closely watched by the investment community in the British colony . 
Xinhua also quoted the former head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade as saying he led a delegation to the United States in March 1995 and met President Clinton . 
the meeting was arranged through entrepreneur Johnny Chung . 
&quot; We never paid Mr Chung any fees , &quot; the agency quoted the council chief , Zheng Hongye , as saying . 
the Washington Post has reported the Federal Bureau of Investigation warned six members of Congress last year they had been targeted by China to receive illegal payments from foreign corporations . 
since the U.S. elections last year , the Democratic Party has returned nearly $ 3 million to donors -- most with links to Asian businesses or donors that were deemed questionable . 
Gore , the most senior U.S. official to visit China since early 1989 , had said during his stay in Beijing that Premier Li Peng vigorously denied any Chinese role in illegal donations to the Democratic Party . 
Gore &apos;s visit was aimed at restoring ties strained by disputes over issues ranging from Taiwan to trade and human rights .
