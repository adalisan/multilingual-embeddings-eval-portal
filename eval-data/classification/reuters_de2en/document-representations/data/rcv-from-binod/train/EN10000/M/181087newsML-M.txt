Thai stocks finished sharply lower in thin trade on Monday as investors took profits on gains of large capitalised stocks last week , said traders . 
the SET Index closed at 947.28 , down 20.32 points or 2.10 percent , on 2.48 billion baht turnover . 
the SET-50 ended down 1.91 points at 72.21 . 
&quot; It &apos;s very difficult to interest anyone this week ahead of the election , &quot; said a foreign broker at Krungthai Thanakit . 
he said the uncertain outcome of the November 17 election increased the risk of pre-poll speculation . 
&quot; It &apos;s a straight forward punt on the election but it is difficult to find a reason to go in this week . 
if the Democrats win , you &apos;d probably have missed the bottom and if the NAP ( New aspiration Party ) comes in , the market could test previous lows so why don &apos;t we wait for that , &quot; he said .
