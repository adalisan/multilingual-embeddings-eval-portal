less than a day after pledging his vote to the government , sacked Associate Health Minister Neil Kirton on Wednesday accused New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger of bullying and smear tactics . 
speaking on TV One &apos;s breakfast news , Kirton said he thought National wanted to back away from the coalition agreement in a number of areas . 
so do my colleagues , &quot; he said . 
&quot; They &apos;re not prepared to engage in any bullying tactics from Mr Bolger . 
they &apos;re not going to be rolled as he may roll his own caucus , &quot; Kirton said . 
&quot; Our caucus is not going to stand by and watch any shenanigans from Mr Bolger . 
they &apos;re going to stand up and say - no , these are the agreements we made and these are the ones we &apos;re going to stick to &apos; . 
Kirton did not specify which policies he believed National was trying to back off , the New Zealand Press Association said . 
he said Bolger had tried to smear him through &quot; selective leaks up and down the country &quot; in recent weeks . 
&quot; My colleagues take a dim view of that . 
they &apos;re not going to tolerate assaults on their members and my caucus colleagues . 
we &apos;re not going to stand around and take that sort of nonsense . 
&quot; Bolger said through a spokeswoman that Kirton &apos;s comments were &quot; nonsense &quot; and he had hoped Kirton would have moved on since last week . 
she said Bolger &apos;s office had not been involved in any leaks to the media about Kirton . 
Bolger yesterday said he would be disappointed if Kirton continued to personally attack him after his decision yesterday to remain as part of the New Zealand First caucus . 
&quot; It would be rather foolish to just stay in there to be an irritant so I have to assume that he &apos;s staying in the New Zealand First caucus to make a constructive contribution . 
Kirton had angered the National Party at the weekend by accusing Bolger of being untrustworthy . 
he said yesterday he would stay with NZ First despite his sacking by party leader Winston Peters , ostensibly for giving a media interview against orders , after long-running and sometimes bitter tensions within the coalition over management of the health portfolio . 
Peters yesterday said he had not asked Kirton to stop speaking out against National . 
the coalition government has 61 seats comprising 44 conservative National Party MPs and 17 NZ First MPs in the 120 seat single-chamber parliament . 
Bolger has refused to rule out bringing lone United Party MP Peter Dunne into the cabinet to shore up the government &apos;s one seat majority . 
Kirton on Wednesday said bringing in Dunne would anger NZ First MPs as having nine NZ First ministers was a requirement of the coalition agreement . 
&quot; I would be very surprised as my colleagues would that that agreement would be broken ...
