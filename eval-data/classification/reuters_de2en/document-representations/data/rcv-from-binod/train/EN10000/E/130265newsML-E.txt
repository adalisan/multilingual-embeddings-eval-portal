the Czech Statistical Bureau ( CSU ) said on Monday it would release revised economic forecasts for the remainder of 1996 and for 1997 at 0800 GMT on November 1 . 
the bureau in August revised down its full-year outlook for growth in gross domestic product to 5.1 percent year-on-year 1996 from 5.4 percent , citing stagnation in European Union demand for Czech goods . 
at that time it raised its current account deficit outlook for 1996 to 81 billion crowns ( 5.7 PCT of GDP ) from 74 billion ( 5.2 PCT ) , but left its inflation forecast for end-1996 untouched at 9.0 percent year-on year .
