U.S. cash crudes were steady late Friday morning in quiet pre-holiday trading , while domestic grade differentials strengthened on reports of a pipeline shutdown in the U.S. Gulf . 
U.S. markets will be closed Monday for observance of the Memorial Day holiday . 
cash dealers said June West Texas Intermediate / Cushing continued to lose ground against a steady July WTI , with last deals on the &quot; roll &quot; pegged at minus 40 cents . 
Friday marks the final day for June crude business . 
Louisiana offshore Oil Port ( loop ) officials said the LOCAP pipeline link to the key Capline system remained shut Friday after experiencing a leak on Thursday . 
some 800,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) of crude throughput was idled while repairs and an investigation into the cause of the incident were conducted . 
loop sources said the line should be back in operation later Friday , but traders said it was possible the offshore link may be out for more than one day . 
loop said force majeure declarations were not needed , as it would be able to compensate for lost production over the course of the month . 
grades were quiet in the June frame , with Light Louisiana sweet / St. 
James talked at vague numbers , 10-30 cents under benchmark . 
heavy Louisiana sweet / Empire was marked at a 30-40 cents discount for June business , and at a negative 50 cents against July WTI . 
West Texas sour / Midland firmed to only a $ 1.20-30 discount for June , but volumes were thin and prices skewed . 
traders said firmers CFDs , a slight narrowing in the Brent-WTI spread and the loop troubles backed the firming trend for grades .
