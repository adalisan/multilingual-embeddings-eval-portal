Ron Gant belted a pair of home runs against his former club on Saturday to lead the St Louis Cardinals to a 3-2 victory over the Atlanta braves and a two games to one lead in the National League Championship Series . 
in the first post-season game at Busch Stadium since 1987 , more than 56,700 fans -- most decked in Cardinals red -- watched with delight as St Louis grabbed the edge in the best-of-seven series against the defending World Series champions . 
the defeat marked the first time the braves have fallen behind in games in their last five playoff series . 
game 4 is Sunday night in St Louis . 
Donovan Osborne pitched seven-plus strong innings for the Cards and Gant provided all the offence against his former teammates . 
he hit a two-run Homer in the first inning and a solo blast in the sixth off Tom Glavine . 
&quot; It &apos;s a great feeling , &quot; Gant said of performing so well against his old club . 
&quot; I had a lot of things happen to me in my career while I was with the braves , a lot of good and a lot of bad . 
you know there &apos;s lot of emotion running through me when I play this ballclub . 
the braves grabbed the lead early when Marquis Grissom scored on a sacrifice fly by Chipper Jones in the top of the first inning . 
the Atlanta lead was short-lived however . 
Royce Clayton opened the bottom of the inning with a single to centre and , one out later , Gant powered a 1-1 pitch over the left-field wall for a 2-1 St Louis lead . 
the tight contest remained 2-1 until Gant led off the sixth by driving a 1-2 pitch from Glavine over the centre-field wall for his fifth career post-season Homer and a 3-1 lead . 
Glavin gave up seven hits and three runs in six innings . 
Osborne was charged with two runs and seven hits . 
Osborne left after allowing singles to Chipper Jones and Fred McGriff to open the eighth . 
mark Petkovsek relieved Osborne and allowed a Javy Lopez single off the glove of third baseman Gary Gaetti to load the bases . 
but the braves were held to just one run in the inning on Jermaine dye &apos;s sacrifice fly that brought Jones home . 
Pinch-hitter Terry Pendleton then lined to second and Jeff Blauser struck out to end the Atlanta threat . 
cardinals manager Tony La Russa , as he has all season , went deep into the bullpen to secure the win . 
Rick Honeycutt threw just one pitch in the ninth and retired Ryan Klesko on a groundout . 
veteran closer Dennis Eckersley then came on and struck out Grissom and got Lemke to fly out to the warning track in centre to end the game . 
Eckersley has finished all five playoff wins for the Cardinals this October and has four saves . 
the braves may have the most feared pitching staff in the majors , but the Cardinals &apos; hurlers have earned some respect after consecutive wins over the world champions . 
&quot; I think the world is seeing now that once our pitchers figure out how to pitch some of these hitters , they &apos;re tough , &quot; Gant said .
