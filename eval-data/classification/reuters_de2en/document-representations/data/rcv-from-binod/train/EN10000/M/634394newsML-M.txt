Spanish markets will brush aside fellow peripheral nation Sweden &apos;s decision to skip the launch of Europe &apos;s single currency , analysts said on Tuesday . 
&quot; This is an issue sui generis ( unique to Sweden ) , &quot; said Valentin Fernandez , economist at Credit Lyonnais in Madrid . 
&quot; The market already smelled something otherwise the yield spread wouldn &apos;t be above Spain . 
on Tuesday , Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson , in the first statement of his ruling party views on EMU membership , said the country would not join Europe &apos;s economic and monetary union at the proposed start in January 1999 . 
although markets once grouped Sweden and Spain together as members of the EMU fringe , Spain &apos;s one-year-old conservative government has taken a different route . 
Spain turned the pursuit of a spot on the team of euro founders into the cornerstone of its European policy , tightening the budget , deregulating industries and was rewarded with lower inflation and interest rates and a steady currency . 
&quot; It &apos;s a little early but in principle I don &apos;t think that affects ( Spain ) . 
for the process , the key countries are France and Germany . 
the UK has already said &apos; no &apos; and now Sweden and Denmark are also keeping to themselves , &quot; said Alfredo Urrutia , chief economist at Societe Generale in Madrid . 
Spanish bond futures ended the day up 72 basis points to 115.91 , rising on a short-squeeze and following sister markets , while disregarding the Swedish news . 
the peseta also shrugged aside the Swedish decision , trading little changed at 84.48 / 50 per mark late in the day .
