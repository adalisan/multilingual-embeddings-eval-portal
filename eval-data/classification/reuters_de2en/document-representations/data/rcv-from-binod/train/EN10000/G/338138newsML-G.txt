French President Jacques Chirac and NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana agreed on Tuesday on the importance of reaching a comprehensive deal on relations between the Atlantic alliance and Russia before a NATO summit in July . 
but they made no progress on France &apos;s call for the United States to hand over NATO &apos;s key southern command to a European officer under a reform of the alliance to accommodate a European defence and security identity , aides said . 
Chirac consulted Solana before flying to Moscow on Sunday to become the first Western leader to meet Boris Yeltsin since the Russian president &apos;s convalescence from multiple heart bypass surgery was complicated by pneumonia this month . 
the French leader reaffirmed his commitment to admitting new , former communist Central European members to the Western defence organisation , which Moscow strongly opposes . 
but he said : &quot; It is important not to create new divisions in Europe . 
presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna quoted him as saying : &quot; We must go ahead with enlargement taking account of Russia &apos;s interests . 
Colonna said plans for Chirac to meet Yeltsin at a country residence outside Moscow were unchanged , despite cancellation of the Russian leader &apos;s trip to the Netherlands next week . 
French media would not be allowed to see Yeltsin , she said . 
a NATO source said Chirac told Solana there was &quot; still a little question mark &quot; over the meeting , but he was preparing to urge Yeltsin to seek a constructive relationship with the West . 
Solana told reporters the French leader &apos;s Moscow trip &quot; will be very important for giving an impulse to these relations &quot; . 
the Spanish NATO chief reported on his talks with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow last week . 
while they did not agree on NATO enlargement , the Russians agreed to negotiations on a charter forging closer ties with the alliance . 
the NATO source said Moscow wanted a binding treaty ratified by parliaments while most Western allies preferred a political charter approved by NATO leaders in Madrid to avoid legally binding obligations . 
while French officials say there is no formal linkage , Colonna said it was important for France that the Madrid summit agree on all three issues : internal reform of the alliance , enlargement and the future relationship with Russia . 
&quot; It is in our interest to do all that together , &quot; she said . 
the United States has already pledged the alliance will not deploy nuclear weapons or foreign troops in peacetime on the soil of new member states . 
the NATO source said there was no need to build big allied military facilties in those countries . 
the relationship on offer involved consultation mechanisms with Moscow , a new treaty on conventional forces in Europe taking into account Russian security needs , arms control talks to reduce the U.S. advantage in submarine-based nuclear missiles and closer financial relations with the West . 
Western diplomats are concerned at moves towards a merger between Russia and Belarus , as well as a hardening line in border talks with the Baltic republic of Estonia . 
the NATO source said Chirac stressed to Solana his sense of urgency on the need to avoid at all costs reaching the Madrid summit without a deal with Moscow . 
on NATO reform , Solana said there had been no change in positions on the southern command , which Washington has refused to give up . 
but he believed a solution would be found &quot; in which everyone -- France and the other allies -- will feel comfortable with the new military structure &quot; . 
spelling out France &apos;s more relaxed approach to the issue after a row with Washington last year , Chirac said Paris would return to NATO &apos;s military command if it achieved a fair sharing of responsibility between the United States and the European allies . 
otherwise it was content to stay out .
