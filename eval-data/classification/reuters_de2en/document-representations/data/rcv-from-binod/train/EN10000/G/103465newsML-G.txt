Kuwait &apos;s post-election government is expected to muster a majority in the new parliament after having to deal for four years with an opposition-dominated house eager to probe its every move , analysts said on Tuesday . 
victory in Monday &apos;s polls by many pro-government MPs had some economists concerned over the fate of plans to reform the economy and balance the budget . 
&quot; They will not be able to take unpopular decisions to reform the economy like the possible introduction of income tax , &quot; said leading economist Jassem al-Saadoun . 
&quot; This is a real loss for the country . 
analysts said about 19 of the new MPs were either pro-government or reluctant to oppose it to secure favours from the state promised to voters during the campaign . 
the outgoing house , one of the Arab world &apos;s most vociferous parliaments , last week approved a $ 14 billion budget with a forecast $ 4 billion deficit . 
in that debate liberal Ahmad al- Rubai said the only solution to cover the shortfall was the introduction of income and corporate taxes for Kuwaitis . 
Rubai lost his re-election bid . 
analysts said pro-government deputies backed by ministers in a post-election cabinet who become ex-officio MPs could easily steer parliament away from the almost weekly confrontations the last house had with the government . 
it had 50 elected MPs and 11 minister members . 
out of some 700,000 Kuwaitis about 107,000 males had the right to vote to select 50 new parliament members from 230 candidates . 
analysts said turnout soared in the final hours on Monday to exceed 75 percent in most districts . 
political parties are not officially allowed in Kuwait where the cabinet will be formed by Kuwait &apos;s ruling al-Sabah family . 
the government &apos;s resignation was accepted on Tuesday by Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah , in line with the constitution . 
the emir has not yet asked Crown Prince Sheikh Saad al- Abdulla al-Sabah to once again form and head a new government , a post he has traditionally held . 
&quot; The government will have a majority and will enjoy a honeymoon for a year or slightly more then real problems will start , &quot; Saadoun predicted . 
but while some Western diplomats agree that the next government could hold a parliamentary majority they say it could still face some tough opposition . 
the second clear winners were Shi &apos;ite and Sunni Moslem fundamentalist MPs and pro-Islamists who secured about 14 seats although they could muster more supporters on several issues from the camps of independents and tribal deputies . 
but the victorious Sunni Islamist MPs belong to two main groups which often disagree and even have rebels from within . 
tribal politcians have about 15 seats with varying politcial leanings . 
Liberals won between seven and eight seats . 
&quot; This parliament is neither white or black , there is plenty of Gray , &quot; one analyst said . 
the outgoing house opened wide probes into alleged official corruption and triggered several financial scandals involving some of Kuwait &apos;s international holdings .
