Pope John Paul called on world leaders on Wednesday to bridge the gulf between rich and poor , telling a U.N.-sponsored World Food Summit it was &quot; intolerable &quot; that some people lived in opulence while others starved . 
&quot; We have to search together for solutions so that there are no longer hungry people living side by side with people living in opulence , &quot; he told heads of state and delegates at the opening of the summit , called to reduce hunger in the world . 
&quot; This contrast between poverty and wealth is intolerable for humanity , &quot; he said . 
the 76-year-old Pope also took a swipe at those who say population control is the key to food security . 
&quot; Demography alone does not explain the inadequate distribution of food resources . 
we must put aside the Sophist view that when there are many , one is condemned to be poor , &quot; the Pope said . 
he said the real reasons behind food insecurity often were political instability , wars , and developing countries mired in debt . 
the Pope also said food insecurity was sometimes caused by &quot; embargoes imposed without sufficient reasoning &quot; . 
the Vatican has in the past criticised embargoes imposed on Cuba and Iraq , saying they hurt the poor most .
