the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to nudge up interest rates early next year to help keep inflation in check and economic expansion on course , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said . 
&quot; Some further , perhaps modest , monetary tightening ... is likely to be necessary , &quot; the Paris-based think-tank said . 
in its semi-annual report on the world economy , the OECD expects U.S. economic growth to slow somewhat over the next two years , allowing inflation to stay steady but pushing up unemployment slightly . 
the forecast assumes that the U.S. central bank will raise short-term rates by a quarter of a percentage point early next year , then hold policy steady throughout 1997 and 1998 . 
the Fed has not changed its monetary stance since January , when it shaved the federal funds rate that private banks charge each other for overnight loans to 5-1 / 4 percent , from 5-1 / 2 . 
the OECD expects longer-term U.S. interest rates to rise in the near future in anticipation of next year &apos;s Fed rate hike , then to edge back down as it becomes clear that no further tightening of credit is in store . 
the higher rates , coupled with a continued restrictive government budget policy , will slow growth and push up unemployment , the OECD said . 
but that will not be enough to choke off the economic expansion , now in its sixth year . 
the group sees growth moderating to 2.2 percent in 1997 and two percent in 1998 , versus 2.4 percent this year . 
&quot; The unemployment rate should drift up as the economy slows , &quot; it added . 
the jobless rate rose to 5.4 percent in November , from 5.2 percent in October . 
the OECD expects it to edge up further over the next two years , to 5-1 / 2 percent -- in line with its long-run equilibrium level . 
the rise in the unemployment rate will help keep inflation in check . 
the OECD expects inflation of 2.1 percent in 1997 and 1998 , as measured by the gross domestic price deflator . 
by that measure , inflation this year is likely to be two percent . 
the OECD &apos;s chief economist , Kumiharu Shigehara , told Reuters Financial Television he expected U.S. slowdown to continue and all financial and economic indicators would have to be closely watched for monetary policy purposes . 
picking up on Fed chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s recent warnings of &quot; irrational exuberance &quot; in stock and asset markets , Shigehara said equity prices were only one of several indicators that had to be kept under surveillance . 
little , if any changes , are also expected by the OECD on the trade front . 
after widening modestly to $ 187 billion this year , the trade deficit is projected to rise marginally to $ 188 billion next year and $ 191 billion in 1998 . 
the OECD urged the United States to take advantage of healthy economic conditions to bring down the federal government budget deficit further . 
&quot; The current strength of the economy would seem to provide some oppurtunity for fiscal consolidation , &quot; the group said . 
it questioned the feasibility of continuing to rely on control of discretionary spending to keep the deficit in check and called on the United States to tackle politically-popular enitlement programs such as Social Security .
