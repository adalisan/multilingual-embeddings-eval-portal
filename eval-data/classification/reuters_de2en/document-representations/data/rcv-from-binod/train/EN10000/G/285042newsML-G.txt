Argentine midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron returned to Italian club Sampdoria five days late from his Christmas break on Friday and faces a possible fine as a result . 
the 21-year-old player said he had been unable to get a flight back from Buenos Aires in time . 
&quot; I &apos;m sorry about what happened and I &apos;m ready to pay the club if it decides to fine me , &quot; Veron told reporters at the club &apos;s training ground . 
it was not clear whether Veron would be made to sit out Sunday &apos;s serie A game at Udinese . 
&quot; Veron is already a great man on the pitch but he has some growing up to do off it , &quot; Sampdoria &apos;s coach Sven-Goran Eriksson said .
