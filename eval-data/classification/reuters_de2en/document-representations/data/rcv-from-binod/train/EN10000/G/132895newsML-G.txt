the United States on Tuesday warned Bratislava that abandoning sensitive criminal probes linked by the opposition to a political feud between the president and premier could damage Slovak ambitions of joining &quot; western structures &quot; . 
Ambassador to Bratislava Ralph Johnson told the independent Slovak Foreign Policy Association that dropping the probe into the kidnapping of the Slovak president &apos;s son and the subsequent death of a former policeman involved in the case would damage attempts to join organisations like NATO and the EU . 
&quot; We make no judgments about the outcome of these investigations , but abandoning them would in our view be very damaging to Slovakia &apos;s candidacy ( to join western structures ) , &quot; Johnson said in an address in Presov according to a text released by the embassy in Bratislava . 
Michal Kovac Junior , adult son of President Michal Kovac , was kidnapped in August 1995 , when he was bundled into the boot of his car and dumped outside a police station in Austria . 
following the sacking of two state detectives who said their investigations led them to suspect the involvement of the state secrete service ( SIS ) in Kovac Junior &apos;s abduction , a third investigator in May adjourned the case due to lack of evidence . 
former policeman Robert Remias was killed in a car blast this spring after acting as the only contact between a former SIS member who said the abduction was organised by Ivan Lexa , the SIS head and close ally of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar who is locked in a bitter political feud with the president . 
the police also adjourned the case of Remias death due to lack of evidence , after it said the blast had been caused by an unspecified explosive set up inside the car .
