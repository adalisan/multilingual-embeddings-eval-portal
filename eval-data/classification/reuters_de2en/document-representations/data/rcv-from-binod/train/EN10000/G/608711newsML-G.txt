chaos overshadowed the start of voting in two referendums in Slovakia on Friday and Western diplomats said any chance for fair polls had already been destroyed . 
Slovaks were voting on whether they wanted their country to join NATO and whether the president should be directly elected by the people instead of by parliament . 
but polling was thrown into confusion by a row over ballots , tied to a long-running feud between the president and the prime minister . 
as a result , some polling stations had no ballots while others had voting slips without the presidential question . 
Western diplomats in Bratislava said the muddle tainted the outcome of the voting and further damaged the already tenuous reputation of Slovakia &apos;s new democracy . 
&quot; The referendum has already been totally discredited and will have no legal significance , &quot; said one diplomat . 
&quot; Now the only conclusion is chaos and chaos is damaging , &quot; another diplomat said . 
the vote on presidential elections was seen as a way for the opposition to stop Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar from assuming presidential powers when the term of his political enemy , incumbent President Michal Kovac , ends next March . 
under the current constitution , presidential powers would pass to the prime minister if parliament cannot muster a three-fifths majority to elect a new president , which neither the ruling coalition or opposition appear likely to achieve . 
Meciar &apos;s government has thus fought a fierce battle to cancel the referendum on presidential elections , which resulted from a petition drive led by the opposition . 
polls were open on Friday from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. ( 1200 to 2000 GMT ) and again on Saturday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. ( 0600 to 1200 GMT ) , with results to be made public on Sunday afternoon . 
the outcome was cast into confusion after Meciar &apos;s interior minister , Gustav Krajci , who is responsible for the technical organisation of the referendums , issued ballots without the question on presidential elections . 
ballots with only the three questions on NATO membership were distributed throughout Slovakia but some mayors refused to accept them , insisting they were illegal without the seal of the Central Referendum Committee ( UKR ) . 
&quot; Our mayor decided to not distribute ballots without the question on presidential elections , &quot; an aide to the mayor of Petrzalka , a district of the capital Bratislava , told Reuters . 
Krajci said scrapping the question on direct presidential elections was justified due to a Constitutional Court ruling that an appendix to the question was irrelevant . 
&quot; The court ruled the appendix was illegal which means that the entire question was illegal , &quot; Krajci told reporters . 
the Central Referendum Committee is responsible for supervisising the referendum and must approve its result for the outcome to be valid . 
its deputy chairman , Jozef Rumpolec , said it would recognise only those ballots with four questions , including the presidential one . 
&quot; The three-question ballots are a forgery , &quot; he said . 
he said the official UKR seal had been reprinted on them from the original four-question ballot , adding : &quot; This is falsification of an official document which is punishable by law and we shall prosecute . 
opposition leaders urged people to insist on being handed a four-question ballot or to refuse to register . 
one diplomat said the chaos was &quot; tragic , because all it serves is to damage yet again not only Slovakia &apos;s image abroad but the concept that the country has of itself . 
the European Union is currently processing questionnaires submitted by potential membership candidates to see if they meet its political and economic criteria . 
diplomats say Slovakia is unlikely to be invited to join the EU because of shortcomings in its democratic reforms .
