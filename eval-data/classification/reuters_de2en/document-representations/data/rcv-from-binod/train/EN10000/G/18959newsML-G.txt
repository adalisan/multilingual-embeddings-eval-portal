South Africa &apos;s fight against spiralling crime and illegal immigrants flooding across its borders was hampered by a moratorium on recruitment to the police force , a senior police officer said on Wednesday . 
police Commissioner George Fivaz told a parliamentary committee on safety and security the shortage of officers meant the country &apos;s borders were virtually uncontrolled , detectives were overworked and too officers were on the beat , while guards protecting VIPs were demoralised . 
crime is one of the worst problems facing President Nelson Mandela &apos;s government , contributing to investor wariness and a flight of skilled emigrants to safer pastures . 
nearly two million serious crimes were reported last year , including 36,888 rapes , 18,983 murders and 66,838 robberies . 
a cost-cutting moratorium on police recruitment has been in force for three years . 
referring to border controls , Fivaz said : &quot; As a result of lack of human resources , we feel some points of entry are not adequately controlled , or control is non-existent . 
the committee heard that 740 police officers were assigned to border control duties , against the 1,600 needed if the force was to carry out the task effectively . 
home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi complained last week that millions illegal immigrants pouring into the country from neighbouring countries , mainly Mozambique , were depriving South Africans of access to services .
