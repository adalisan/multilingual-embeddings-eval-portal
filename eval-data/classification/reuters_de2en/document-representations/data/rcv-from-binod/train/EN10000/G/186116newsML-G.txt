France bestowed its highest artistic honour on Mexican screen legend Maria Felix on Tuesday , paying tribute to her &quot; rebel beauty &quot; and her 30-year cinema career which included roles with some of the greatest directors of the 1950s and 1960s . 
the 82-year-old grande Dame swept into the chateau-like French embassy residence for the award dressed in black mink and perfectly made up , looking at least 30 years younger than her age . 
Ambassador Bruno Delaye presented the medal recognising Felix &apos;s years of residence in Paris , her roles in French films such as &quot; French Can-Can &quot; and her love of France . 
under the glare of television lights and the gaze countless cameramen and reporters in the residence &apos;s classical library , Delaye recalled Felix &apos;s triumphal first arrival at Paris &apos;s Montparnasse station in 1950 at the peak of her fame . 
&quot; People said : &apos; She has the beauty of the devil , &apos; &apos; She drives men crazy , &apos; &quot; Delaye said . 
&quot; They say King Farouk of Egypt offered his empire for her ... Charles de Gaulle received her at the Elysee Palace . 
recalling her friendships with French writer Jean Cocteau -- who reputedly said Felix was &quot; so beautiful she causes damage &quot; -- Salvador Dali , Max Ernst , Jean Renoir and Luis Bunuel , Delaye paid tribute to her &quot; eyes of fire and demeanor of a queen &quot; before draping the medal aroud her neck . 
the award of Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters was granted to Felix in Mexico at her request . 
normally French president Jacques Chirac would have bestowed the honour . 
poised and assured , Felix replied to the assembled guests without a moment &apos;s hesitation or a second &apos;s pause in her diction : &quot; I dedicate this great honour to Mexican cinema . 
I also dedicate it to French cinema which gave me the opportunity and also to Mexican culture and Mexican television . 
looking on as she received her award was Octavio Paz , Mexico &apos;s Nobel Prize-winning novelist and one of the tiny club of Latin Americans to hold the French honour . 
&quot; It makes me very happy first as an old admirer and friend of Maria , secondly as a Mexican and thirdly because she is my companion in this distinction &quot; Paz told Reuters . 
while Felix posed for cameras on the marble staircase of the embassy &apos;s main halls , one of Mexico &apos;s foremost intellectuals , writer Carlos Monsivais , gave his view . 
&quot; I think it &apos;s just , rather late distinction to a figure who with 57 films crowned an epoch , created a style , launched an image , obtained a nythical niche for herself and established an imperial will in a society in which women were relegated and marginalized &quot; , Monsivais told Reuters . 
Felix herself said in a magazine interview published at the weekend that she never watched contemporary Mexican films &quot; because I don &apos;t like watching bad things . 
&quot; Like French cinema and Italian cinema , we are up against the fact that North American cinema occupies 90 percent of the screens all over the world , &quot; Monsivais said .
