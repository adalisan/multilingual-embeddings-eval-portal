rates were narrowly mixed in the morning with activity centred on the overnight rate which rose sharply due to the end of the quarter , a local dealer said . 
&quot; All eyes are on tonight &apos;s release of the U.S. May personal income / consumption , new home sales and Chicago purchasing managers index , &quot; a local dealer said .
