the away team Italy may hold an edge going into their Davis Cup semifinal against France starting on Friday because they prefer the surface . 
French number one Cedric Pioline faces Andrea Gaudenzi in the first singles at the Palais des Sports de Beaulieu . 
the Italians are happy with the new surface , but Yannick Noah &apos;s French team were surprised to find it slow for a synthetic surface . 
&quot; The court is better than we expected , &quot; said Italy &apos;s number one Renzo Furlan , who meets Arnaud Boetsch in the second singles . 
&quot; It &apos;s a good court , not too fast , and the balls are not too fast either , &quot; added Furlan , who on slow red clay in Rome helped Italy beat 1995 finalists Russia and South Africa on the way to their first semifinal since 1980 . 
&quot; If they wanted a faster court , they should have chosen an older surface rather than a brand new one , &quot; Italian captain Adriano Panatta said . 
Noah said : &quot; On Monday we were surprised , but today is Thursday and we have been preparing in relation to the court . 
&quot; We have been able to adapt and should stop talking about it . 
veteran doubles player Guy forget said that with constant use over the past few days , the surface , the same as that at Bercy for the Paris indoor tournament , had become faster . 
Noah kept his choice of second singles player -- between off-form Boetsch and forget -- a secret until Thursday &apos;s draw . 
then he opted for the younger man . 
&quot; They both had similar performances at the U.S. Open and they are at present more or less on the same level , &quot; he said . 
I opted for Arnaud on some small points and , besides , Guy is a stalwart in doubles . 
forget and Guillaume Raoux will play the doubles -- against Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso -- in a team unchanged from the quarter-final victory over Germany . 
Boetsch gives France more possibilities . 
France last met Italy in a Davis Cup tie in Rome in 1977 , losing 4-1 to the then holders . 
Italy lead France 5-4 overall .
