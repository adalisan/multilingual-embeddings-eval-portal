NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana met President Bill Clinton and other top U.S. officials on Thursday and discussed efforts to forge a special relationship between the alliance and Russia . 
Solana later told reporters he hoped to make progress during a visit to Moscow beginning Jan . 19 for talks on a proposed new charter between Russia and the Western alliance , stressing that &quot; it is not an easy process . 
&quot; I hope to make progress &quot; in Moscow , Solana said at a Pentagon photo opportunity with Defence Secretary William Perry . 
&quot; It is not an easy process , but with tenacity , with good will , I am sure we will be able to overcome the difficulties and have something on track before the summit . 
he referred to a summit meeting of NATO leaders in July . 
Russia has raised strong objections to the alliance &apos;s plan to accept new member states from Eastern and Central Europe and is demanding participation in future NATO decisions on key issues that affect Moscow &apos;s security . 
the White House said on Thursday Clinton sent a get-well note to Russian President Boris Yeltsin , who was admitted to hospital with early symptoms of pneumonia on Wednesday . 
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the note extended the best wishes of Clinton and his wife , Hillary , for a speedy recovery . 
a senior U.S. official said the White House meeting was focused mostly on plans for a special relationship between Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ahead of Solana &apos;s trip to Moscow for talks with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov . 
the U.S. official said the plans for the special relationship were not yet at the stage of writing a draft charter . 
&quot; We believe that the Russian Federation has a definite role to play in the security architecture of Europe in the post-Cold War era , and we think that because NATO is the linchpin of our security ... formalising a relationship between Europe and Russia will bring greater security and stability to the continent , &quot; the official said . 
Solana had a working breakfast with outgoing Secretary of State Warren Christopher and later stopped at the White House for hour-long talks with Vice President Al Gore , a meeting that Clinton dropped in on . 
NATO is expected to issue membership invitations to some countries this summer . 
diplomats say Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic will probably all be members by 1999 and that Russia is seeking as many concessions as possible before enlargement goes ahead . 
but Solana on Thursday repeated NATO &apos;s warning that it would give Moscow no veto power over enlargement of the alliance , which Russia says could leave it isolated and threaten its security . 
&quot; The decision about opening NATO has already been taken , but we are doing our best to construct solid and long-lasting relations with Russia , &quot; he said .
