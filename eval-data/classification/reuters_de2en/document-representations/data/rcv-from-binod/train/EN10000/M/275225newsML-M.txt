U.S. mortgage-backeds were broadly flat as numerous market players abandoned their trading posts early for the Christmas holiday while some refused to show up at all , traders said . 
&quot; Nothing is going on , &quot; said one New York-based trader . 
he said about half of his colleagues failed to report to work . 
&quot; ( Trading today ) is a waste of computer time , &quot; he added . 
a dearth of economic data Tuesday is also responsible for the lack of trading activity in the market , another mortgage trader said . 
&quot; It &apos;s completely dead ... we &apos;re just sitting on our hands until we get some indication of where the economy is heading , &quot; he said . 
by midday Tuesday , pass-throughs were flat across the board . 
specifically , Ginnie Mae 7.0 percent coupons were on par with yesterday &apos;s close at 100-13 / 32 , yielding 113 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note . 
comparable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac paper was flat as well , at 100-09 / 32 and 100-13 / 32 , respectively . 
the 10-year Treasury note was up 1 / 32 to yield 6.34 percent . 
trading in U.S. bond markets will resume on Thursday .
