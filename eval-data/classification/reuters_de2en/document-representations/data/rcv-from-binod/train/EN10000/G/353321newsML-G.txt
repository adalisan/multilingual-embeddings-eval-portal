U.S. bowling officials formally recognised perfection Tuesday in approving a record performance by a college student who bowled three consecutive perfect 300 games . 
Jeremy Sonnenfeld , a student at the University of Nebraska , became the first Bowler ever to officially roll a 900 series , the American Bowling Congress ( ABC ) said . 
Sonnenfeld , a 20-year-old sophomore from Sioux Falls , South Dakota , set the record Sunday at the Junior Husker tournament at Sun Valley lanes in Lincoln , Nebraska . 
in order to roll a 300 game , a Bowler must score 12 consecutive strikes . 
Sonnenfeld rolled 36 strikes in a row , something that had never happened in properly sanctioned circumstances in the ABC &apos;s 101-year history . 
Jack Mordini , an ABC spokesman , said Sonnenfeld was being heralded as &quot; the Tiger Woods of bowling &quot; because of his dedication to the sport . 
&quot; It &apos;s absolute perfection in a three-game series , &quot; Mordini told Reuters . 
there have been at least four 900 series reported to the ABC but none was officially recognised for various reasons , including unsanctioned tournaments and lane conditions that failed to meet ABC standards . 
the ABC said it will present Sonnenfeld with an award Saturday during the opening ceremonies of its 1997 tournament in Huntsville , Alabama .
