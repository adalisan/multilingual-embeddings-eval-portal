tentative early gains in Malaysian blue chip shares on Tuesday failed to hold , and the market quickly resumed a downtrend as buying evaporated . 
while a month-long drop in stock prices has yielded attractive values , investors were sidelined ahead of a slew of U.S. economic data this week , said one equity analyst with a local firm . 
&quot; Everyone is keeping a close watch ( on the data ) , &quot; he said . 
at 0206 GMT , the composite Index of blue chips was down 6.04 points to 1,068.82 after rising to 1,077.48 earlier . 
among U.S. economic reports expected to be released this week are April nonfarm payrolls on Friday and the Bureau of Labor Statistics &apos; quarterly employment cost index on Tuesday . 
concerns about possible higher U.S. interest rates and &quot; assumptions of poor ( Malaysian ) trade deficit figures &quot; are among the factors weighing on Malaysian stocks , a report from Jupiter Securities on Tuesday said . 
the February trade balance report is due to be released on Tuesday at around noon local time . 
expectations on the figures are mixed , with some predicting a surplus and others a deficit . 
among individual stocks , plastics product and battery maker Polymate Holdings debuted at 11.00 ringgit against a 5.00 ringgit offer price .
