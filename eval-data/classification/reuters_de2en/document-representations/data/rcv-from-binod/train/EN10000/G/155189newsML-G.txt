China on Wednesday urged its military factories to cast off outdated ideas of communist central planning and embrace market reforms to stay afloat in an increasingly competitive business environment . 
&quot; Frontier military factories should abandon old ideologies and adopt business strategies to survive market competition , &quot; the China Daily said . 
although military plants in remote central and western regions enjoyed financial and technological support from Beijing , many had failed to convert to production of consumer goods that people actually wanted to buy , the newspaper said . 
&quot; Recently , the situation has deteriorated further despite the strong scientific and technological strides made by the armed forces , &quot; it said . 
many factories had focused entirely on pumping out a huge volume of goods while turning a blind eye to market demand and advertising , it said . 
&quot; A close investigation finds these enterprises are losing ground because of ineffective management techniques , &quot; it said . 
thousands of scientists and workers in frontier military firms had jumped ship to work in more profitable companies in the thriving eastern part of the country , it said . 
the newspaper urged military factories to reform their creaky management systems . 
&quot; The bulk of the military resources that originally were designated for national defence should be reallocated with civilian resources within the regional economy , &quot; it said . 
many of China &apos;s military factories in an arc near the east coast have already shifted production lines from army hardware to more profitable consumer goods . 
China &apos;s wheezing state sector has been battered by market-oriented reforms launched in 1978 by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping , who also called on the military to throw itself into civilian production .
