Merrill Lynch analyst Ted Arnold says in his latest Monthly Base and precious metals Report that he looks for the spot gold price to erode to a low at $ 350 per ounce at some point in 1997 . 
&quot; Prices continue to erode away with the upside looking increasingly limited , &quot; Arnold wrote . 
&quot; We still look for $ 350 basis spot to be seen at some point in 1997 . 
&quot; Gold closed in London at $ 377.15 in London on Friday . 
Arnold estimated that most trade in the next two months would be in a range of $ 360- $ 390 with any strong upward move above $ 385 triggering heavy forward producer selling . 
Arnold also saw copper as bearish in 1997 but thought that aluminium might head higher some time in the year . 
on copper &quot; there is a normal , seasonal bull story to be told as well as a &apos; speculative &apos; bull story that should give us another four or five months of reasonably high copper prices , &quot; he wrote . 
&quot; But fundamentals are very bearish from second half 1997 onwards . 
producers and merchants should be forward sellers on rallies above $ 2,000 a tonne &quot; . 
copper on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) late Friday was just above $ 2,200 after a brisk rally in recent days . 
aluminium was also firm around $ 1,530 per tonne . 
Arnold said of aluminium that &quot; we look for higher prices next year on the back of restocking demand &quot; . 
&quot; But aggressive producer forward selling and the huge overhang of stocks will probably keep three months prices below $ 1,500 a tonne for some time to come &quot; . 
Anrold rated zinc as &quot; flavour of the month &quot; as investment and commodity fund interest grew in that metal . 
but he said lead was stuck in an $ 800- $ 700 trading range while consumers stayed out of the market negotiating with smelters .
