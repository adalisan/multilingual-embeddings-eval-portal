note . 
SUSR said in a note that due to the changes in the population &apos;s expenditure structure , it had revised the formulas for calcuating CPI in 1997 , using 1995 data as a base . 
all 1997 figures use the new base , while 1996 figures use January 1989 as a base . 
SUSR said it added some new items to the inflation basket , and modified others , and that weights calculated had been chosen for the universal consumption basket . 
the number of basket items has been cut to 708 from previous 836 . 
the new basket will have 11 main divisions and 38 groups . 
the new basket divisions are : the foodstuffs and soft drinks ( 140 items ) ; alcohol , tobacco and pharmaceuticals ( 12 items ) , clothes and shoes ( 125 items ) ; household energy , utilities and fuels ( 46 items ) ; furniture , household appliances and maintenance ( 92 items ) ; healthcare ( 21 items ) ; transportation ( 54 items ) ; recreation and culture ( 77 items ) ; education ( 6 items ) ; hotels , cafes and restaurants ( 49 items ) ; various goods and services ( 86 items ) . 
CPI indexes were previously published in four main groups of items -- foodstuffs , non-food items , public catering , services-- and 34 sub-groups . 
the weights of the new items will be calculated based on the data monitored from the statistics of household accounts for 1995 .
