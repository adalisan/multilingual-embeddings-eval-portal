the Chinese yuan ended up at a two-year high close of 8.2900 against the U.S. dollar in Shanghai on Wednesday , due to speculative buying in the last few minutes of trading , traders said . 
the close was the highest since May 18 , 1995 when the yuan ended at 8.2892 . 
it closed at 8.2908 last Saturday with a weighted average price of 8.2907 . 
the exchange was closed from Sunday to Tuesday to mark the Chinese takeover of Hong Kong . 
the yuan opened unchanged at 8.2908 and moved stably around 8.2910 for most of the session , hitting an intra-day low of 8.2915 early in trading . 
speculative buying emerged in the last 10 minutes of trading , pushing the yuan to an intra-day high of 8.2890 and its two-year high close , traders said . 
trading was slow with most business done at 8.2908 , traders said . 
&quot; speculative buying , helped by strong pro-yuan sentiment on the market , pushed the yuan up in the last 10 minutes , making it end at the key 8.2900 resistance level , &quot; one trader said . 
he said the People &apos;s Bank of China , the central bank , had not intervened to depress the yuan recently , which had helped to boost pro-yuan sentiment on the market . 
&quot; buyers were encouraged by the yuan &apos;s rise in the last few trading days before the holiday and by the absense of intervention by the central bank , &quot; he said . 
a second trader said trading was dull because the market had not fully recovered from the holiday mood after a three-day break . 
&quot; The yuan &apos;s rise today was not solid with trading so slow , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It will not stand firm above the 8.2900 level and is likely to see a technical correction on Thursday . 
the yuan closed slightly down at 7.2412 from 7.2331 against 100 Japanese yen and unchanged at 1.0690 against the Hong Kong dollar .
