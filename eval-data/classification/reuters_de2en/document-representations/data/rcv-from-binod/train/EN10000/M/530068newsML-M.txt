South Korean gold prices fell in lacklustre trading over the past week in line with losses in the international market and soft demand due to the financial troubles of Jinro Ltd , dealers in Seoul said on Tuesday . 
&quot; Actually , nothing has changed from last week . 
demand is still in the basement due to a slowdown in the domestic economy , &quot; said a dealer with Tong Yang Global . 
domestic gold demand was undermined by news of financial troubles at Jinro Ltd and Chung won Corp , traders said . 
the news has dealt a fresh blow to South Korean financial markets , already hit by the collapse of two steelmakers this year under heavy debts -- Hanbo Steel Co in January and Sammi Steel Co in March . 
a bullion dealer said one unusual development in the past week was an influx of gold from North Korea into the South Korean domestic market . 
&quot; The North Koreans seemed to be desperate for hard currency to celebrate former leader Kim Il-Sung &apos;s birthday on April 15 , &quot; the dealer said . 
gold producer LG metals &apos; daily selling price for the precious metal , which is regarded as a benchmark for the local bullion wholesale market , fell on Tuesday to 10,250 won per gram from 10,350 won a week ago . 
the company &apos;s silver price rose to 152 won a gram from 151 won a week earlier . 
the telegraphic transfer selling rate for customers , posted by the Korea Exchange Bank , edged up to 896.60 won against the dollar from 897.90 won week ago . 
the rate is regarded as a benchmark of local foreign exchange rates for companies .
