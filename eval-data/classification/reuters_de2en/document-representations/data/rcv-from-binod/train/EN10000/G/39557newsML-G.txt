a furiously charging Mike Tyson stopped a dubiously hurt Bruce Seldon at one minute , 49 seconds of the first round to win the World Boxing Association ( WBA ) heavyweight title on Saturday . 
Tyson came out fast at the sound of the first bell of the scheduled 12-round fight , charging Seldon but missing with wild roundhouse punches . 
Seldon tried to keep Tyson away with a jab , but when Tyson kept coming Seldon grabbed onto him . 
Tyson was credited with two knockdowns , but the first one was a phantom punch for most of the crowd of about 9,000 fans who shouted &quot; fix , fix , fix &quot; after the fight was stopped . 
Seldon went down the first time after Tyson missed him with a right that sailed over his head . 
but Seldon fell down anyway . 
referee Richard Steele did not begin counting , as he appeared to think Seldon had slipped . 
Seldon got up quickly and Tyson charged him , landing a left hook on the top of Seldon &apos;s head sending Seldon down to the canvas where he bounced before getting up quickly again . 
on his feet , Seldon shook his head as Steele began counting . 
then Seldon , in a delayed reaction , staggered back into the ropes and Steele waved the fight off . 
Tyson referred to Cus D &apos;Amato , his late trainer and surrogate father , saying : &quot; Cus , two down , one to go . 
Tyson was referring to having added the WBA title to his World Boxing Council championship . 
&quot; I was just trying to set him up for the knockdown , &quot; Tyson said . 
the jab was very powerful . 
he was fighting and moving so he was hard to hit at first . 
my mode of operation once I get a man hurt is reckless abandon . 
with the boos of the crowd ringing in his ears , Seldon said : &quot; So you know how hurt I am right now . 
I did not realise how hard he hits , or how fast he is . 
I did not train 12 weeks to come here and take a dive . 
it &apos;s not about money . 
he is a great fighter . 
he is a bad man . 
as the challenger , Tyson was first to enter the ring in the MGM Grand Arena . 
he wore his traditional black trunks , black shoes without socks and a black towel over his shoulders . 
he was soaked in perspiration . 
it was Tyson &apos;s fourth fight since his release from prison in March 1995 after serving three years on a rape conviction . 
Tyson easily dispatched amateurish Peter McNeeley in the first round of their fight in August of that year . 
Tyson stopped Buster Mathis Jr in the third round in December 1995 and Briton Frank Bruno last March to win the WBC title . 
Seldon climbed into the ring wearing white trunks trimmed in red and blue . 
one of Seldon &apos;s cornermen carried a small picture of Seldon &apos;s late mother over his head , apparently as inspiration to Seldon . 
Tyson , now 45-1 , was a a 22-1 favourite to beat Seldon , who lived up to his reputation of having a glass jaw . 
Seldon &apos;s best weapon going into the fight had been considered to be his jab , which he threw several times . 
but the 29-year-old Seldon , who said earlier this week he planned to take Tyson into the later rounds where he thought Tyson &apos;s stamina would be suspect , apparently recognised his futility against Tyson and went down , it seemed , at the first opportunity . 
Seldon , now 33-4 , won the vacant WBA title in April 1995 , stopping a faded Tony Tucker on cuts in the seventh round . 
before Saturday night , Seldon last fought in August 1995 , when he stopped Joe Hipp , a ponderous punching bag . 
Seldon was paid $ 5 million for showing up against Tyson , 30 , who was guaranteed $ 15 million for the Seldon encounter . 
Tyson is expected to surrender the WBC title within a couple of days as part of an ageement stemming from a New Jersey lawsuit filed by Lennox Lewis , the former WBC champion . 
Tyson is expected next to fight former champion Evander Holyfield on November 9 .
