Dutch call money eased from the highs reached earlier this week , as a generous allocation under the central bank &apos;s latest special advances pact brought liquidity back into the market . 
dealers said call money changed hands between 3.12 and 3.18 percent , down from a peak of 3.50 percent early on Thursday . 
this morning the central bank allocated 5.29 billion guilders to the money market under a new seven-day special advances pact at an unchanged rate of 3.00 percent . 
the new pact replaces a seven-day facility of 4.15 billion guilders which expired today . 
individual banks received 18.0 percent of the amount they had applied for . 
&quot; We had expected the allocation under the pact to be ample ... call has returned to more normal levels , &quot; one dealer said . 
he said he considered overnight guilder rates of some 10 basis points above the special advances rate reasonable . 
the central bank confirmed on Thursday it had bought guilders from other central banks , and dealers said these transactions had probably pushed call rates higher . 
the guilder fractionally strengthend against the mark , trading at 112.606 per 100 marks , versus 112.635 on Thursday . 
other money market rates and rates for Dutch Treasury certificates were unchanged from Thursday and trade was fairly quiet , dealers said . 
&quot; People will wait to see the U.S. data coming up this afternoon , before deciding whether or not they want to do something in the Dutch money market , &quot; one dealer said .
