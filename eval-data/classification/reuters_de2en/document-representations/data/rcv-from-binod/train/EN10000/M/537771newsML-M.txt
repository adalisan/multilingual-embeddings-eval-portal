U.S. treasuries were stuck in a tight boxed range near Wednesday &apos;s New York closing levels by Tokyo midday on Thursday , with many operators sidelined ahead of a slew of key economic data scheduled for next week . 
&quot; The market is very quiet and it should stay quiet until operators can determine the trend more clearly , &quot; a senior brokerage trader said . 
&quot; With the dollar also caught in a tight range , Japanese investors are unable to take fresh positions . 
traders said the market also lacked direction as operators were unable to determine the short-term trend from recent price movements seen in overseas markets . 
the key 6-5 / 8 percent 30-year bond stood at 94-9 / 32 , yielding 7.09 percent , compared with 94-10 / 32 in New York . 
the June T-bond futures contract rose 1 / 32 to 107-24 / 32 from the previous trade . 
among upcoming data , the first-quarter Employment Cost Index is due on Tuesday . 
the National Association of Purchasing Management April survey is due May 1 . 
April U.S. employment data is due May 2 . 
&quot; From the data , we have to judge whether inflationary pressure is growing at a pace which could induce a further credit tightening by the Fed , &quot; another trader said .
