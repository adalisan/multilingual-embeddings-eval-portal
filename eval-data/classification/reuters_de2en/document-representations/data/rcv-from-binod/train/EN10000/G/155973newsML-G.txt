Mexico beat St Vincent 5-1 in a World Cup qualifier on Wednesday but were still jeered off the pitch by a crowd who expected them to equal or beat an 11-goal tally against the same opposition four years ago . 
for the last 30 minutes , the 40,000 fans at the Aztec stadium began backing St Vincent , chanting &quot; Ole &quot; almost every time the amateurs from the Caribbean passed the ball . 
fans also demanded the resignation of Mexico coach Bora Milutinovic , criticised for experimenting with young players in vital qualifying games . 
midfielder Benjamin Galindo , at one stage left out of the team by Milutinovic , opened the scoring with a 20th-minute free kick and converted a penalty eight minutes later . 
Galindo returned to the team against Jamaica two weeks ago when he orchestrated a 2-1 win . 
second half goals by Brazilian-born striker Zague , Carlos Hermosillo and St Vincent &apos;s Dexter Walker , who deflected Ricardo Pelaez &apos;s shot into his own net , put Mexico 5-0 ahead and on top of semi-final group three in the CONCACAF qualifiers . 
but St Vincent , trounced 11-0 in a qualifier in the same stadium four years ago , had the last say when Kendall Velox scored with a shot from outside the penalty area two minutes from the end .
