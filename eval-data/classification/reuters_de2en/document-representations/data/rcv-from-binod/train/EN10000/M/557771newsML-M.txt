foreign investors bought heavily shares in 27 South Korean companies early on Friday , the first day of the latest increase in the foreign ownership ceiling , an official at the Korea Stock Exchange said . 
the official said no new shares remained available for foreign investors of sought-after core blue chips including Samsung electronics , SK Telecom , POSCO and Kookmin Bank . 
also selling out were Sungmi Telecom and Sam-A Aluminium , which are not considered blue chips . 
the foreign stock ownership was raised to 23 percent on Friday from previous 20 percent . 
the ceiling was last raised in October . 
but blue chip share prices remained lower as domestic institutional investors , accumulating the stocks ahead of the ceiling rise , sold into the newly created foreign demand .
