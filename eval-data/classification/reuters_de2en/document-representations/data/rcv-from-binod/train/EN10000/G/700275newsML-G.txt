the deputy head of Algeria &apos;s feared Armed Islamic Group ( GIA ) has surrendered to authorities and has given them details about the guerrilla group &apos;s bases , leaders and structures , an Algerian newspaper said on Tuesday . 
Liberte newspaper reported a GIA statement condemning as a traitor the group &apos;s number two , Radouane Makador who it said gave himself up to the authorities last month . 
the GIA ordered its activists in Algeria and abroad to cut links with him . 
&quot; Radouane &apos;s betrayal was proved true and he has given meaningful information to the security forces about the GIA &apos;s leading figures , strongholds and structures , &quot; said the reported statement signed by Farid Achi , a GIA leader . 
according to this statement , Radouane , who used the noms de guerre Mohamed saidI or Radouane Abu Bassir , headed the GIA &apos;s foreign relations department . 
&quot; The GIA urges its links abroad to be cautious because the traitor has betrayed them and sabotaged all plans for transporting and routing of weapons , &quot; the newspaper said . 
the GIA is blamed by the authorities for most of the savage killings in Algeria , including massacres of villagers , the murder of journalists , intellectuals and foreigners , and the kidnapping and raping of girls . 
the Algerian government , fighting an armed Moslem rebel campaign , last May offered residents up to 4.5 million dinars ( $ 80,357 ) for information leading to the capture or killing of the country &apos;s most wanted guerrillas . 
among those sought by the authorities were Radouane and the GIA &apos;s leader Antar Zouabri . 
Algerian security forces killed a total of 17 Moslem rebels later that month as a direct result of tip-offs in return for rewards . 
Liberte newspaper said three suspected Moslem activists had been arrested in Britain thanks to information provided by Radouane to Algerian security officials who passed it onto their British counterparts . 
about 60,000 people have been killed in Algeria since 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists took a commanding lead . 
President Liamine Zeroual , trying to pacify the oil and gas producing North African country , barred radical Islamists from competing in general election last month . 
but he allowed moderate Islamists to field candidates who won 103 seats in the 380-seat National Assembly ( lower house ) . 
seven moderate Moslem fundamentalists were appointed in a coalition government named last week to speed up economic reforms and tackle the country &apos;s main social woes , unemployment and shortage in housing .
