Chilean blue chips closed softer in quiet trade on selling by local investors of commodity stocks , said traders . 
the bourse is seen opening slightly higher with gainers expected to include forestry shares which have been hurt in recent sessions by lower-than-expected wood pulp prices , they said . 
the general IGPA index shed 0.37 percent at 5,326.04 points amid volume of 10.6 billion pesos . 
the market has been unsettled by concerns that public sector wages could rise steeply , fuelling inflation and damaging the prospect of an early interest rate cut , said dealers . 
the government is due to announce the increase Friday . 
analysts expect the rise to be around nine percent , although the workers &apos; union ANEF is demanding 13 percent . 
forestry stocks are seen recovering in coming days after investors overreacted to jitters over pulp prices , said dealers . 
they noted pulp is selling for a spot price of $ 580 a tonne , which is higher than most investors realise . 
&quot; This should feed through into stronger fourth quarter earnings , &quot; said one trader . 
COPEC , Chile &apos;s largest pulp company , lost 2.13 percent to 1,605 pesos . 
winners included cement company melon , up 2.37 percent at 82 pesos , and fertilizer producer Soquimich , which gained 0.42 percent to 2,380 pesos .
