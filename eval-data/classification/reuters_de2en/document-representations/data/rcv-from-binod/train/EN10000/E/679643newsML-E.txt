the World Bank held its first talks on Monday with Laurent Kabila &apos;s new Congo government and said it hoped to help sort out the country &apos;s huge debt burden . 
finance Minister Mawapanga Mwana Nanga told a news conference after meeting the Bank delegation , &quot; This country has inherited a very large ( foreign ) debt that is estimated at more than $ 14 billion . 
&quot; The debt had been accumulated over a period of 32 years . 
we have been in power for 30 days . 
we need enough time to work this out . 
there is a way of finding solutions . 
he said separate commissions would work on domestic and foreign debt . 
&quot; We want to know how much we owe and to whom . 
we have asked the World Bank and the other Bretton Woods institutions to be patient , &quot; Mawapanga said . 
&quot; We hope that when the information is available , we &apos;ll sit down with the government and its creditors to try to help , &quot; Bank delegation leader Callisto Madavo , vice-president for Africa , told the news conference . 
&quot; We have had a very constructive meeting , one in which we have really come to listen to you , hear what your plans are and how we might best help . 
Mobutu Sese Seko , who seized power in 1965 and ran the economy into the ground , fled into exile when he was ousted last month after a seven-month rebellion by Kabila &apos;s Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo . 
the Bank suspended structural adjustment loans to Zaire in 1990 and withdrew entirely from the country three years later . 
the IMF , which also quit , has yet to make contact with Kabila . 
at the time loans were cut , Bank officials estimated that two thirds of the national budget was being spent on the presidency and other related political functions . 
further corruption and mismanagement saw the other third scarcely reaching the social sector it was destined for . 
the Bank and IMF have been criticised by Mobutu &apos;s foes both at home and abroad for continuing to lend to the former Zaire long after the extent of mismanagement was exposed . 
but so far there has been no sign from major creditors of a willingness to write off part of the vast foreign debt . 
the Alliance has yet to spell out a concrete strategy of how they plan to redevelop the country , devastated not only by decades of misrule but also by the recent conflict . 
they say , however , that they can finance internally the major projects already announced . 
these include a promised renaissance in road-building involving up to 5,500 km ( 3,500 miles ) of tarred road , and a petrol pipeline to cross Africa &apos;s third largest country . 
for the moment , analysts consider these projects to be pipe dreams . 
however , outside help for redevelopment is on offer on a grand scale should the government persuade international opinion it has sensible policies , Bank officials say .
