&quot; It is certainly stronger than expectations . 
it does confirm that manufacturing is recovering . 
&quot; But it is important to note that this survey was taken before sterling &apos;s recent rally ... I think the rapid rise we &apos;ve seen in sterling is going to hit business confidence and it &apos;s goiong to undermine manufacturers . 
so whilst it is an encouraging figure , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be sustained . 
&quot; The survey will do little to narrow the split over whether the base rate should have been hiked this week . 
although the overall diffusion index came in at a robust enough 54.5 ... the key price component remained very subdued at just 44.8 . 
this effectively implies that prices again fell last month and is further reason for supposing that near term at least , the outlook for inflation is favourable . 
it also suggests that competitiveness factors are as strong as ever and bodes well for the disappointing September RPIX to be reversed , or at least not to constitute the start of a new trend . 
&quot; We see the data pointing to the peak of the current UK interest rate cycle being well below those seen in the past . 
survey will keep markets anxious about more tightening , but the price component should be soft enough to prevent the curve from getting any steeper . 
&quot; fairly robust survey . 
it supports the view that manufacturing is joining with the rest of the recovery . 
we &apos;ve had quite a few months now of healthy PMI and this continues that trend . 
one thing that is healthy for manufacturing is that it is across the board . 
the sharpest rise in capital goods since February 1995 indicates maufacturers are gearing up to invest . 
this supports the view that the above trend growth balance will continue over the coming months . 
but it is being led by the consumer side and that is what is benefiting manufactuers . 
it is all domestic demand driving things forward . 
&quot; This confirms that the manufacturing sector is significantly healthier than the government &apos;s official statistics suggest . 
it also suggests that general growth in the economy is probably stronger than the GDP figures are indicating at the moment and this is further confirmation that the Chancellor was right to increase base rates . 
there is an implication that if this sort of growth continues through the economy we will see further base rate increases next year , possibly with one coming before the election .
