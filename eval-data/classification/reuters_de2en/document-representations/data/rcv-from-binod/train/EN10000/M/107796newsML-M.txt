Croatian stocks traded mixed on Thursday with some losses among blue chips and further gains in selected hoteliers , but traders predicted further growth . 
&quot; The end of the positive trend is not yet in sight , &quot; said Igor Kos of brokerage Taurus . 
&quot; The motto of the day is &apos; buy &apos; , &apos; buy &apos; , &apos; buy &apos; . 
he said moderate losses among blue chips indicated most had reached their limit . 
but there was still enough interest to keep the prices of other shares high and rising . 
&quot; There is enough available capital around to propel the growth , &quot; Kos said . 
six of 13 active stocks were up , six down , while one , Varazdinska Banka , traded for the first time . 
fully listed drug firm Pliva , trading for the first time in a week , lost 500 kuna to close at 12,500 on a meagre volume . 
this followed its downward trend at the London Stock Exchange .
