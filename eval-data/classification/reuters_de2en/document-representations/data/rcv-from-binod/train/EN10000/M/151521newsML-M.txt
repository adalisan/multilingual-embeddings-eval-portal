Austrian shares dipped to a one-month low on Tuesday after the ATX index broke through a 200-day moving average and traders said further losses could be in store . 
the ATX index of 21 blue-chip shares fell 14.35 points , or 1.33 percent , to 1,062.24 points . 
two issues ended in positive territory and 19 were down . 
&quot; technically the market looks as if it will go lower , &quot; said a trader , noting that a 200-day moving average at 1,067-1,068 had failed to brake the ATX &apos;s slide . 
he forecast a test of support at 1,050 points on Wednesday . 
others predicted the market would manage to hold above 1,060 . 
&quot; Admittedly support has given but I still see the market in an upward trend , &quot; said a trader at another bank . 
semi-conductor maker Austria Mikro Systeme ( AMS ) was the biggest decliner , continuing a slide ahead of nine-month earnings data due on Thursday . 
the firm posted a group pre-tax loss of 3.1 million schillings in the first half . 
traders said a decline in the share price of telecoms firms Ericsson and Nokia may also have contributed to AMS weakness . 
Bank Austria was the biggest gainer , climbing three schillings , or 0.72 percent , to 419 schillings . 
the broad-based Vienna bourse index shed 4.14 points , or one percent , to end at 408.19 points .
