MATIF September notionnel futures spiked higher on Wednesday and technical analysts said the market , dragged by strong Bunds , could hike to the June 16 top of 129.52 . 
but Charles Diebel , senior fixed income analyst at Technical Data in London , said daily momentum indicators were gloomy and the odds for direction were 50-50 now . 
&quot; The overall picture is not as constructive as in Bunds , &quot; Diebel said , adding that if the pivotal level of 128.80 failed , losses could be extended to 128.42 , the low on June 20 . 
if 129.12 is taken out , 129.52 will be viable , Diebel said . 
&quot; With Bunds constructive I guess you &apos;ve got to favour the upside , &quot; he said . 
Richard Adcock , technical research manager at HSBC futures in London , said in a note prices appeared to have aborted the downside potential and the latest rally looked like a bullish continuation pattern from which further strength could develop . 
&quot; Short term pullbacks under the figure ( 129.00 ) should be well-supported , &quot; he said , adding attacks to 129.52 were expected . 
stops should be placed at 128.64 , he said . 
September Pibor futures were up 0.03 at 96.59 .
