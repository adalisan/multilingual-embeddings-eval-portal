frustrated robbers shot dead four people and injured 10 when an attempt to hold up a small pawnshop in Manila went wrong , police said . 
police investigator Crispin Sarmiento said the robbers killed the owner of the pawnshop , who had failed to open the shop &apos;s vault due to a time-delay lock system , and a woman employee who was phoning the police . 
Sarmiento said the 10 robbers then fired at bystanders on their way out , killing a policeman and a driver of a van travelling along the busy street . 
ten other bystanders were caught in the crossfire , he added . 
the robbers also fired a grenade launcher , but the weapon misfired . 
one of the suspects was later arrested .
