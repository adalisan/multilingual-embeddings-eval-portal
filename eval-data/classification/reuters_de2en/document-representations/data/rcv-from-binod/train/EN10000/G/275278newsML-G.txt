two Russian mountaineers have launched an attempt to be the only climbers to ascend North America &apos;s tallest peak in mid-winter , the National Park Service said on Monday . 
Artur Testov , 31 , and Andrey Isupov , 32 , both experienced climbers with years of seasoning in the Himalayas and Caucauses , were shuttled by air-taxi over the weekend to a glacial valley about 7,000 feet ( 2,100 metres ) up 20,320-foot ( 6,194-metre ) Mount McKinley , Park Service spokesman John Quinley said . 
&quot; They suggest that they will be back on Jan . 10 , &quot; Quinley said . 
if successful , theirs would be the earliest winter ascent of McKinley , but Quinley said conditions will be challenging . 
the National weather Service estimated winds of 40 mph ( 65 kph ) in sheltered areas , and at least twice that in open areas on the mountain , he said . 
Testov , the expedition leader , and Isupov will have to use snowcaves at all times for shelter , Quinley said . 
&quot; In these winds and temperatures you &apos;re not in a tent , &quot; he said . 
with the mountain just 250 miles ( 400 km ) south of the Arctic Circle , the climbers will have only about five hours of daylight a day , Quinley said . 
almost all climbers who attempt McKinley do so in the late spring and early summer , when daylight is longest and weather conditions are most favourable . 
the first successful winter ascent of McKinley was January 1967 . 
of the team that began the climb , one died and three reached the summit on Feb . 28 , and then nearly died after becoming stranded in a snow cave at 17,200 feet ( 5,240 metres ) . 
the expedition became the basis of a book titled &quot; minus 148 Degrees &quot; , after the wind-chill factor calculated by the climbers before their rescue . 
Japanese climber Naomi Urema was the first solo climber to reach McKinley &apos;s summit in the winter in February 1984 . 
but he died on his descent and his body was never found . 
Alaskan climber Vern Tejas in 1988 became the first solo climber to make it to the summit in winter and survive . 
he completed that expedition that March .
