as expected British Petroleum kept both Brent cargoes from Wednesday &apos;s chains , trade sources said . 
the two cargoes -- due to load in the April 17-19 loading range -- were kept before the five o &apos; clock deadline . 
BP now holds around 12 cargoes and has kept every cargo , bar one , from the April programme so far .
