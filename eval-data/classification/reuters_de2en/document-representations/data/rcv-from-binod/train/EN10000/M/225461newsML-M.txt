the Federal Reserve is expected to inject reserves into the banking system through overnight system repurchase agreements Friday , analysts predicted . 
although the 10-day system RPS done Monday and the five-day system RPS from Wednesday are seen sufficient to take care of the projected $ 7.0 billion average daily add need for the rest of the maintenance period , tight federal funds make an operation necessary , most agreed . 
funds opened at 5-3 / 4 percent , but have moved to six percent -- well above the 5-1 / 4 percent target rate . 
should there indeed be an operation , it would likely be earlier than its usual 1130 est / 1630 GMT intervention time , due to the early market close . 
analysts said that the fed funds rise is technical . 
they noted funds are usually soft the day after thanksgiving , but the holiday came late in the month this year . 
funds should remain tight through Monday , as the two- and five-year notes , sold last week , settle .
