Yugoslavia could soon reach a deal on rescheduling its debt with London Club creditors , Tanjug newsagency reported on Wednesday . 
Vuk Ognjanovic , who heads the Yugoslav team holding talks with the London club , has announced there is a chance of a &quot; non-standard and favourable model for rescheduling the country &apos;s debt , &quot; the report said . 
London Club creditors have already agreed to postpone repayment of the Yugoslav debt and were ready to offer other benefits , Ognjanovic was quoted as saying . 
&quot; Yugoslavia does not ask its debt to be written off , &quot; said Ognjanovic . 
&quot; We are discussing the possibility of converting part of our debt into shares in profitable sectors , i.e. 
energy , traffic , tourism and agriculture . 
Ognjanovic said the talks with commercial bank creditors would resume in mid-December . 
Yugoslavia , comprising Serbia and Montenegro , is struggling to return to the international financial markets and institutions after four years of U.N. trade and oil embargo . 
the embargo , which crippled the economy , bringing it to the verge of collapse , was lifted last October , but the so- called outer wall of financial sanctions is still in place , preventing access to urgently needed foreign capital . 
included in the conditions for Yugoslavia &apos;s full return to the international community were cooperation with the Hague war crimes tribunal on Bosnia and human rights improvements .
