the government proposed a radical reform of Italy &apos;s inefficient justice system on Friday that could lift the threat of jail from hundreds of people awaiting trial in the graft scandals that have swept the country . 
the draft law , approved by the centre-left cabinet , allows defendants to seek a fast-track summary trial for all crimes and a plea-bargained reduced or suspended jail sentence on a host of offences ranging from bribery to fraud and armed robbery . 
designed to help clear some four million criminal cases awaiting a final verdict and restore public faith in justice , it now goes to parliament for debate . 
the measures are expected to take about a year to become law . 
justice Minister Giovanni Maria Flick has dismissed critics who say the proposals will allow prominent politicians and businessmen implicated in Italy &apos;s tangentopoli ( Bribesville ) corruption scandals to get off scot free . 
&quot; The real whitewash consists in letting time go by , &quot; Flick said on Thursday , referring to a backlog of several hundred tangentopoli cases that have yet to come to court . 
legal experts say many could lapse under a statute of limitation unless action is taken . 
&quot; As I have said several times , all the proposed reforms are made for the future and designed to restore efficiency to the justice system , &quot; Flick said . 
tangentopoli , which broke in 1992 , toppled Italy &apos;s political old guard with former prime minister Bettino Craxi , now living in self-imposed exile in Tunisia , heading a galaxy of star names to fall foul of magistrates &apos; investigations . 
media magnate Silvio Berlusconi , prime minister in 1994 , is on trial at the moment in two separate corruption cases and is among defendants who could opt to benefit from the new measures if they are passed into law . 
Italian justice is notorious for its slowness . 
many trials take years to work their way through clogged courts because of an automatic right to appeal up to the final instance . 
statistics issued on Friday showed that only 0.3 percent of the 4.35 million criminal cases that were pending in mid-1995 had been concluded by last June with a definitive verdict . 
&quot; Instead of providing hope and comfort , Italian justice too often generates suffering , &quot; said Ferdinando Zucconi Galli Fonseca , head of the Court of Cassation , Italy &apos;s highest court . 
&quot; There is deep mistrust of justice and the state , &quot; he said . 
Italy at present has only access to summary trial and plea-bargaining in only relatively few cases . 
flick &apos;s package seeks to extend the arrangement to around 80 percent of cases . 
the proposed plea-bargaining arrangement would apply to all crimes except murder , Mafia activities , kidnapping , drugs trafficking and sexual violence though defendants in such cases could still opt for a fast-track trial and some remission . 
Plea-bargaining would entitle a defendant to one-third off a sentence . 
the judge could award further reductions for payment of damages and compensation and mitigating circumstances . 
if the remaining prison term is less than three years , defendants could be eligible for a suspension of the sentence , house arrest or community service . 
la Repubblica newspaper calculated on Friday that an Italian sentenced to 12 years for armed robbery could cut the jail term to 29 months under what it called Flick &apos;s &quot; discount &quot; scheme .
