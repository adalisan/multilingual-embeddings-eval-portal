Australian political and business leaders on Friday welcomed a strong public attack by Prime Minister John Howard &apos;s on race row politician Pauline Hanson , but said he should have acted earlier . 
the country &apos;s richest businesswoman , Janet Holmes a Court , and Labor opposition leaders said the divisive national race row sparked by Hanson had undermined Australia &apos;s international standing and put jobs at risk . 
former foreign minister Gareth Evans , now an opposition leader , said Howard had only been stung into action by polls showing Hanson &apos;s fledgling party had grabbed 10 percent opinion voter support . 
&quot; What he said was long , long overdue , &quot; Evans said in a radio interview . 
&quot; He didn &apos;t say anything when it was the decent thing to say . 
he didn &apos;t say anything when Australia &apos;s international reputation was first put at risk . 
he didn &apos;t say anything when Australia &apos;s trade and jobs were being put at risk . 
&quot; He &apos;s only said something now when the opinion polls have come out and coalition votes have been put at risk . 
Howard on Thursday launched his strongest attack so far on Hanson , an independent MP who sparked a national row with a campaign against Asian immigration and Aboriginal welfare . 
Howard , who had largely tried to ignore her until now , accused Hanson of exploiting fear and instability and threatening links with the booming economies of Asia . 
&quot; The Hanson cure would be worse than the disease , &quot; Howard told a Sydney dinner to launch a branch of the U.S-Asia Society . 
&quot; The political campaign mounted by the member for Oxley ( Hanson ) seeks to exploit fear and instability without offering solutions for hope . 
Holmes a Court , who is also a central bank director , said Australians should seize the opportunity offered by Howard &apos;s attack to put the race row genie back in the bottle . 
&quot; There are a lot of people trying to push it back in the bottle -- and I think there was an opportunity to have stopped it earlier in its tracks , but that wasn &apos;t taken , &quot; she said . 
&quot; I &apos;m hopeful that as more and more of our government politicians and more and more people in the community are expressing their outrage that it &apos;ll go right back in ( the bottle ) again .
