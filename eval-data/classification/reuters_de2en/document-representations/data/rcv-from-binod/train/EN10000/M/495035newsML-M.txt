the European meals and feeds market started quietly this morning with sellers offering South American soymeal pellets $ 4 to $ 9 higher on the back of last night &apos;s sharply higher Chicago soymeal futures close . 
most other products were quoted unchanged to $ 2 up in sympathy with soymeal . 
no trades were reported during the early stages of the market . 
&quot; The strong fluctuations on Chicago and a stronger dollar kept most buyers sidelined early , waiting to see whether Chicago futures would rise further or follow Project A &apos;s slightly easier trend , &quot; one broker said.--KAREL LUIMES + 31 20 504 5832
