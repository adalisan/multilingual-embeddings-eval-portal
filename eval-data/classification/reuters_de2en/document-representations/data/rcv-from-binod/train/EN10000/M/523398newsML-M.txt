Indian markets &apos; relief that the United Front ( UF ) coalition has found a new leader will turn to despair at the loss of industry and investors &apos; favourite , Finance Minister P.Chidambaram , analysts said on Sunday . 
&quot; It is a bad result , &quot; Tushar Sarda , president and chief executive officer of Daewoo Securities in Bombay said , adding that he foresaw stormy markets ahead . 
the UF chose Inder Kumar Gujral as its nominee to take over from defeated caretaker prime minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda , but paid the price of losing the Tamil Maanila Congress ( TMC ) , the party to which Chidambaram belonged , from the alliance . 
the TMC , whose leader G.K. Moopanar had been a frontruner for the premiership , quit the government but vowed to back it from the outside . 
the markets entered the weekend with high hopes India &apos;s fractious politicians would square their differences to end three weeks of anxiety that followed the Congress party &apos;s removal of support for the UF until it replaced DEVE Gowda . 
the Bombay Stock Exchange top 30 index closed up 49.08 points , or 1.35 percent , at 3,696.52 on Thursday as optimism spread . 
the BSE and other major exhanges were closed on Friday for the Moslem EID al-Adha festival . 
but despite Gujral &apos;s nomination the situation remained fluid on Sunday . 
Questionmarks hung over whether he will be approved by President Shankar Dayal Sharma to form a government , and whether the TMC would return to the UF fold . 
those uncertainties showed among analysts as some expected stock markets to open stronger on Monday out of sheer relief that mid-term polls are put off at least a little while longer . 
&quot; The market will open strongly because the main uncertainty factor -- the possibility of snap polls -- has been resolved , &quot; said Ketan Jhaveri , chief dealer at Kotak Securities , the Indian associate of Goldman Sachs . 
others believed the selling would start straight away . 
in kerb trading at the weekend outside the BSE , shares in India &apos;s biggest private company reliance Industries shares shot to 298 rupees on news Gujral had been chosen , and promptly lost around three percent to 290 when the TMC &apos;s departure became known . 
reliance , whose full year results are released on Tuesday , had closed up 4.5 percent on Thursday at 280 rupees . 
Gujral &apos;s appointment -- if approved by President Sharma -- as prime minister should save the country from immediate mid-term polls but he will head a smaller more vulnerable minority government and has lost the kudos of having Chidambaram steering economic policy . 
&quot; The whole charm of new coalition government is dimmed because of the Chidambaram factor , &quot; said Rajesh Bajaj , director at Calcutta brokerage Lohia Securities . 
&quot; Chidambaram had very heavy weightage in the market . 
Subra Subramaniam , director of of HG Asia , the investment arm of ABN-AMRO said the markets are likely to turn lower , but not overreact to Chidambaram &apos;s departure . 
he saw the BSE index pacing a range of 3,300 to 3,700 for the next three to four months . 
now , parliament starts a three day debate on Monday over the 1997 / 98 ( April-March ) budget , presented eight weeks ago , with Chidambaram no longer in place to defend his proposals . 
investors , aside from hoping the UF would find an acceptable replacement for DEVE Gowda , were pinning hopes for reviving confidence on a smooth passage for the budget , which contains large individual and corporate tax cuts . 
but in the uncertain political climate , some of the tougher measures , like those on subsidy cuts , may fall by the wayside as parliamentarians think more about keeping their seats in a mid-term poll than holding down the budget deficit . 
meantime , approval of the budget and lower interest rates and easier credit invoked by the Reserve Bank of India in its half-year policy statement issued last week should underpin the market , analysts said . 
analysts struggled to name any potential candidates of Chidambaram &apos;s quality to take over at finance , but expected Industry Minister Murasoli Maran , who has also actively pursued liberalisation policies , to feature .
