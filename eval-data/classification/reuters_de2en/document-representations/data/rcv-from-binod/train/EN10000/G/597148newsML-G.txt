Russia said on Tuesday it would reconsider its new partnership with NATO if the Western alliance moved towards offering membership to the Baltic states . 
foreign Ministry spokesman Valery Nesterushkin reiterated remarks by President Boris Yeltsin on Monday that Moscow would not tolerate any attempts to grant NATO membership to former Soviet republics . 
&quot; As far as the Baltic countries are concerned , you probably noted what our President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin said during a meeting with leaders of our parliament , &quot; Nesterushkin told a regular briefing . 
&quot; It was clearly said that , in the case of such ideas taking on a more concrete form , then Russia has the possibility and the grounds to reconsider the character of its relations . 
the Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania were annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 and regained independence in 1991 . 
Russia agreed to a new security partnership with NATO last week after months of negotiations , clearing the way for the Atlantic alliance to invite new members from eastern Europe at its July summit in Madrid . 
Yeltsin is expected to sign the NATO-Russia pact at a meeting with Western leaders in Paris on May 27 . 
Russia remains opposed to NATO expansion , expected initially to bring in Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic . 
but NATO leaders have said no outside country can veto who joins the alliace in the future . 
during a meeting with leaders of the opposition-dominated parliament on Monday , Yeltsin said : &quot; If NATO begins to take decisions without taking account of Russia &apos;s opinion , Russia will review its relations with the alliance . 
Yeltsin is trying to strike a balance between cooperating with the West and calming nationalist and communist fears over NATO expansion , which they see as a threat to Russian security . 
Russia &apos;s security deal with NATO sets up a new NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council , with monthly meetings by ambassadors and twice-yearly gatherings of foreign and defence ministers . 
U.S. officials said Russia would have a veto power within that council but stressed that the North Atlantic Council -- made up of the 16 current NATO members -- would continue to set alliance policy and would not be subject to any Russian block . 
possible NATO membership for the Baltics , which have sizeable ethnic Russian minorities , is a particularly sensitive issue for Moscow . 
as many Russians see it , if both Poland and Lithuania were to become NATO members then Russia &apos;s Kaliningrad region , part of Prussia seized from Nazi Germany at the end of World War Two , would be completely cut off from the rest of Russia by a potentially hostile alliance . 
Latvia and Estonia also both border on Russia . 
the Baltic states , which view NATO membership as a shield against Russian domination , on Tuesday reiterated their firm desire to join the alliance . 
&quot; Our position regarding NATO membership does not change , &quot; Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas told Reuters . 
&quot; Lithuania was forcefully incorporated into the Soviet Union and does not consider itself a former republic of the Soviet Union . 
the state secretary of the Latvian Foreign Ministry , Maris Riekstinsh added : &quot; It is unfortunate that just a few days after an agreement in principle has been reached between Russia and NATO Russia &apos;s politicians are already doubting fundamental positions therein .
