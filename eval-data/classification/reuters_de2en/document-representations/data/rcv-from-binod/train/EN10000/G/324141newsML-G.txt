Brisbane , Jan 23 - Poor technique cost New Zealand in their 0-3 soccer loss to Norway in Brisbane last night , coach Keith Pritchett says . 
NZPA reports that Norway took a while to show their full range of skills but when they turned up the heat after about an hour , the All Whites had no answer against a team ranked 14th in the world . 
&quot; To be honest , it was technique that let us down , &quot; Pritchett said after the match . 
&quot; The first goal came when Andy Rennie failed to clear a ball and they buried it in the back of the net . 
I wouldn &apos;t want to see Andy singled out but it was an example of our poor technique . 
that goal came exactly an hour into the match and two minutes later New Zealand were lucky not to be 2-0 down when Chris Zorocich conceded a penalty when he hacked down goalscorer Bent Skammelsrud . 
goalkeeper Jason batty made a great save to stop the penalty , but Pritchett said it was a turning point in the game . 
&quot; It was poor technique by Chris which led to that penalty , and while Jason did very well to save it the game turned around at that point , &quot; Pritchett said . 
&quot; Until that point we &apos;d coped quite well defensively . 
&quot; They stepped up the pace of the game in the second half and while we coped for a short time they ran away from us in the end . 
the match started off as a physical battle with Norway , who are leading their European World Cup qualifying group with three wins from three games , taking their time to subdue the All Whites . 
new Zealand captain Rodger Gray said his team handled the physical battle well . 
&quot; That first 30 minutes was more a physical battle than a technical one -- neither team conceded too much and we coped quite well . 
Pritchett described Norway &apos;s attack as &quot; aerial bombardment &quot; . 
late in the first half they created four chances in a row with deep crosses to their tall attackers . 
however , New Zealand generally handled the challenge and Norway changed tactics in the second when they realised their aerial attack was testing , but not breaking down , the New Zealand defence . 
once they chose to keep the ball at their feet they had the tired New Zealanders stretched and eventually were rewarded with all three goals and the missed penalty coming in the final third of the match , the last two goals coming in the last 10 minutes . 
the second was an own goal against Zorocich , who tried to block a cross by Skammelsrud but deflected it past batty , who had started to follow the trajectory of the cross . 
Norway went ahead 3-0 when they made a quick move out of defence and Havard Flo out-ran the New Zealand defenders to stab a shot under batty in the 84th minute . 
new Zealand had their share of possession but Norway &apos;s defence was tight and well-organised and the All Whites got very few shots on target . 
the All Whites &apos; main route to the goal was by trying to play the ball straight down the middle , which proved ineffective . 
in the second half , their best attacks went through the flanks with Simon Elliott and Mark Burton doing a lot of good work . 
however , their crosses were usually cut out easily by the Norwegian defence . 
new Zealand had limited creativity in the midfield with their two best midfielders Michael McGarry and Chris Jackson both ruled out with groin strains . 
Stu Jacobs and Danny Hay were called on to fill the midfield role and didn &apos;t deliver the same attacking skills as the injured pair . 
Darren McClennan picked up his second yellow card in as many matches and will miss New Zealand &apos;s final game of the series against South Korea in Sydney on Saturday night . 
in the other match last night , Australia beat South Korea 2-1 after leading 1-0 at halftime . 
South Korea were reduced to 10 men for almost the entire second half but came back from 2-0 down and will cause New Zealand a lot of problems with their speed and ball control .
