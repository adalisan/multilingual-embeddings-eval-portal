Kabul &apos;s Taleban rulers gathered about 500 civil servants and residents to stage a protest against what they called foreign interference by neighbours on Thursday . 
the protesters , who marched more than one mile ( km ) through the city centre to the Iranian embassy and the U.N. political office in Kabul , slammed Russia , Iran and India as the main culprits . 
&quot; Death to interventionists ! 
down with Iran and Russia ! 
&quot; chanted a Taleban preacher , standing on a car roof , through a megaphone . 
it was the first such demonstration under the Taleban administration in Kabul , and was clearly staged with its blessing . 
armed Taleban fighters guarded the procession and were often the only ones shouting slogans through most of the march . 
very few of the other marchers seemed enthusiastic or echoed the slogans . 
among them was a group of 30 women and children , one of whom said that the Taleban movement should lift its restrictions on work and education for women . 
&quot; We ask the Taleban to provide education and job opportunities for women of Afghanistan , &quot; said the burkha-clad woman , who taught for 40 years in Kabul until the Taleban takeover last month . 
some said they had been summoned for a morning meeting and then had been told to join the march . 
&quot; It is like a spontaneous demonstration . 
we didn &apos;t know anything about it , &quot; one participant said .
