Australian marathon swimmer Susie Maroney , 22 , on Monday became the first person to swim from Cuba to Florida , walking ashore exhausted but smiling after 24-1 / 2 hours in the water . 
&quot; We had strong currents and I felt really good , &quot; Maroney told reporters at Key West &apos;s Fort Zachary Taylor Beach moments after reaching the shore . 
she completed her 108-mile ( 174-km ) swim in just over 24 hours , standing up near what is considered the southernmost point in the continental United States at 12 : 17 p.m. EDT ( 1617 GMT ) . 
a small crowd waiting onshore applauded loudly as the swimmer left her shark cage and covered the last 100 yards ( 33 metres ) of open water before leaving the choppy sea under an overcast sky . 
Maroney said she had been fuelled by &quot; happy thoughts &quot; during the trip , whose most difficult time had been the lonely night . 
sitting on a park bench next to her doctor , Michael Stein , who dived into the water and swam ashore with her , a relaxed Maroney called making it to shore &quot; the best feeling in the whole world . 
she said she was having difficulty talking because the long exposure to salt water had swollen her tongue . 
she also said she had been stung by jellyfish and had seen at least two sharks . 
about six hours after landing , Maroney fainted during an interview with a U.S. television network in the park , but she was back on her feet after a few minutes . 
it was exhaustion . 
I feel fine now , &quot; she told Reuters later from the Key West hotel where she was resting . 
sources vary widely on how many times people have attempted to swim across the shark-infested Straits of Florida , which separate Cuba from the U.S. mainland . 
the crossing had been considered one of swimming &apos;s last great challenges . 
but Connie Pignatiello , a U.S. coordinator of Maroney &apos;s swim , said the trip completed on Monday was the 21st attempt . 
Maroney herself tried and failed last June . 
a storm , heavy seas and adverse currents forced her to abandon the attempt only 12 miles ( 19 km ) short of the Florida keys after battling for 38-1 / 2 hours . 
she vomited and hallucinated before being plucked from the water . 
her team had expected this year &apos;s trip could take as long as 45 hours , based on the near miss . 
but this time the weather and navigation were better . 
&quot; Everything just coincided , &quot; said Maroney &apos;s mother , Pauline , who encouraged her daughter from a platform on one of the accompanying boats . 
&quot; The Gulf Stream is like a river . 
if you try to get through too early or too late , you just get swept away . 
Maroney said she had been tempted to stop on Monday morning as she neared Sand Key , a tiny uninhabited island about six miles ( 10 km ) east-southeast of Key West , but felt her real goal had been to make it to Key West . 
she said she was in about as much pain as last year but obviously this attempt had gone much more smoothly . 
&quot; We didn &apos;t have a storm like we did last year , &quot; she said . 
two television crews , from Australia and the United States , were aboard the boats , recording Maroney &apos;s crossing . 
her brother , Michael , was also on a boat . 
Maroney said her next challenge might be to swim from Mexico to Cuba . 
after speaking to reporters for about half an hour , Maroney left for a nearby hospital , where she was to be examined by doctors before resting at a hotel . 
the American marathon swimmer Diana Nyad twice tried and failed to swim the Florida Straits in the 1970s . 
in July 1978 , 65-year-old Walter Poenisch attempted the crossing as a &quot; swim for peace . 
&quot; He eventually came ashore in the Florida keys , but his claim is doubted by swimming authorities because he allowed no independent observers on board his boat .
