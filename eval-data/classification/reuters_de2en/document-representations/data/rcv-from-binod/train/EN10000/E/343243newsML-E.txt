Romania &apos;s public deficits are far larger than disclosed by the ousted leftist government and stand at 13 percent of gross domestic product , Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea said on Thursday . 
&quot; The budget deficit is in fact three times larger than initially set by the former government and , along with the quasi fiscal ( gap ) , it stands at around 13 percent of GDP , &quot; Ciorbea told a news conference broadcast live . 
Ciorbea , who leads a centrist coalition elected last November , said public utilities and other state companies had amassed huge losses . 
the heavily subsidised farm sector had swallowed credits worth the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars which could not be recovered . 
the 1996 budget deficit has been estimated at 5.7 percent of GDP , far in excess of initial forecasts by the outgoing government of 2.2 percent .
