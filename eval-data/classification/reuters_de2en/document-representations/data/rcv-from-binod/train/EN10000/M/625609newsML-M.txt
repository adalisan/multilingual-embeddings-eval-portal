the flap raised over Germany &apos;s plan to revalue gold reserves and worries about the French elections on Sunday likely won &apos;t have a lasting effect on either country &apos;s debt , analysts said . 
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel has said the country &apos;s gold and currency reserves should be revalued toward market prices and more than 20 billion marks realized from the gain turned over to the government in order to enable it to qualify for European Monetary Union membership . 
Waigel said not a single mark would be used to reduce Germany &apos;s budget deficit , rather the proceeds would flow step by step into a fund created to offset long-term debt . 
&quot; If anything ( the revaluation ) is more of a currency play . 
Bunds started off the day ( Thursday ) a bit down but there was no major move , &quot; said Kathleen Stephansen , senior economist at Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. 
Stephansen said some of the conservative-moderates who had been voting with the right wing could come back into the center and allow the present government to eek out a small majority . 
that could spur a relief rally -- though probably a short-lived one as there will be concern as to how interested a new conservative government would be on fiscal restraint . 
&quot; They have changed their rhetoric to focusing on job growth , &quot; she said . 
&quot; On the other hand , if the Socialists win and ( Lionel ) Jospin becomes prime minister the market will sell off but it will only be temporary . 
the market will realize whatever party wins there is very little room for manuevering as public spending can &apos;t be increased as neither party will want to undo progress made on the budget deficit . 
&quot; Left or right , essentially you &apos;ll see a more pragmatic government , &quot; Stephansen said . 
&quot; near-term jitters over the French election and uncertainty ... throws the whole monetary union process &quot; into disarray , &quot; said Josh Feinman , vice president and global markets economist at Bankers Trust Co . 
the German Bund market was much less vulnerable , he said . 
&quot; You can make the argument that if the EMU blows up it &apos;s good news for Germany , &quot; Feinman said . 
&quot; With the French on the other hand -- if the Socialists win -- it could make EMU much harder to achieve . 
&quot; In the short run ( the EMU process ) will be dominated by politics . 
it &apos;s not just these countries ( Germany and France ) that are worried , &quot; said Joe Carson , chief fixed-income economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
&quot; This ( EMU ) has always been a political agreement rather than economic . 
they are now coming to the realization that to get this agreement in play , there will have to be adjustments , &quot; Carson said . 
while Germany was supposed to always be the benchmark of currency strength and fiscal discipline in Europe , fiscal austerity in the way it was formed under President Jacques Chirac will be a thing of the past , he said . 
&quot; They want jobs , &quot; Carson said .
