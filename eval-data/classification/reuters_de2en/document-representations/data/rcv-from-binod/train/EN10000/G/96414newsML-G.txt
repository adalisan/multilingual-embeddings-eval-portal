voters in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro will face a runoff election for mayor in November after no candidate won more than 50 percent of votes in Thursday &apos;s municipal election . 
in Sao Paulo , Brazil &apos;s largest city , right-wing candidate Celso Pitta just missed winning outright in the first round after receiving 49 percent of the vote . 
Pitta , a political neophyte who had never before run for political office , could become Sao Paulo &apos;s first black mayor if he beats runner-up Luiza Erundina of the Worker &apos;s Party ( PT ) in the Nov . 15 runoff . 
in Rio de Janeiro , Pedro Conde of the Liberal Front Party ( PFL ) will face Sergio Cabral of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso &apos;s Social Democrat Party ( PSDB ) . 
voting nationwide came off smoothy as more than 100 million Brazilians went to the polls on Thursday to pick mayors and councilmen in 5,500 municipalities across the country . 
local issues such as public transport , crime and housing dominated voter concerns , disappointing some opposition candidates who hoped to turn the nationwide poll into a referendum on Cardoso &apos;s free market reforms . 
analysts said Cardoso , who is halfway through a four-year term in office , would appear to have emerged strengthened by Thursday &apos;s election results . 
they said the president would benefit from signs that voters were choosing candidates with moderate platforms and rewarding predictable politicians that offered them continuity . 
&quot; This election was all about continuity and that is good news for the president , &quot; said political analyst Walder de goes . 
with the elections now over , Cardoso is expected to concentrate his efforts on persuading congressmen to approve a constitutional amendment that will allow him to run for re-election . 
billed as Latin America &apos;s first computerised election , some 30 percent of voters punched candidates &apos; numbers into shoe-box sized electronic ballot boxes . 
however electoral officials confessed being embarassed by delays in vote counting process which continued long after it was scheduled to end .
