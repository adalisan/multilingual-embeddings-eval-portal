Shanghai &apos;s A share index closed sharply down on Tuesday for the second straight day due to Beijing &apos;s unexpected crackdown on the stock markets on Monday , traders said . 
the A share index lost 100.964 points or 9.64 percent to 946.716 points after plunging 9.92 percent on Monday . 
traders said panic selling continued on Tuesday with market sentiment badly hurt by the crackdown , but bargain-hunting in some cheap stocks emerged today , pushing volumes up substantially over Monday . 
the A share trading volume rose to 542.2 million shares worth 5.1 billion yuan , from 129.5 million shares worth 1.3 billion yuan on Monday . 
the trading volume of B shares rose to 40.7 million shares worth $ 16.2 million from 6.6 million worth $ 2.9 million on Monday . 
all 42 B shares traded , with 33 down , three flat and six up . 
brokers said Shanghai B shares had lost a lot in the past few days and the B share index was likely to rebound in the next few days . 
&quot; compared with the more speculative A share market , there is less risk to invest in B shares at current levels with their lower price / earnings ratios , &quot; one broker said . 
&quot; Some long-term investors began to build positions today , and the B share index is likely to rebound in the coming days , &quot; a second broker said . 
Shanghai Lujiazui Finance Trade Zone Development traded the most on profit-taking , falling $ 0.032 or 2.80 percent to $ 1.112 , on volume of 3.5 million shares .
