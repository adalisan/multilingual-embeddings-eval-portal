the powerful Christian Coalition on Friday branded President Bill Clinton as untrustworthy and immoral and said it would do everything it could to defeat him in the Nov . 5 election . 
the mood was sombre as the 1.7 million-member organisation convened for its annual meeting with polls showing Clinton heading for probable victory and Republicans in danger of losing their majorities in Congress . 
former Education Secretary William Bennett , who has spent many days campaigning for Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole , said bluntly the election ought to be about character because Clinton was a liar and a cheat . 
&quot; I think he &apos;s unreliable and I think he &apos;s unprincipled , &quot; said Bennett , compiler of the best-selling &quot; Book of virtues &quot; , a compendium of morally uplifting literary and biblical selections aimed at children . 
&quot; If something terrible should happen in November ... 
I want to be on record as having said , &apos; You knew this was going to happen . 
we told you so , &apos; &quot; Bennett said . 
he pleaded with voters to start paying attention to the character of the candidates . 
&quot; If we now say that this doesn &apos;t matter , we have sent a message to our children that will have profound consequences . 
this is addressed to the American people . 
you should care about his ( Clinton &apos;s ) character . 
Texas billionaire Ross Perot , running for president as head of the Reform Party , was jeered when he disputed the notion that his 1992 White House bid helped elect Clinton . 
no smooth politicians would have given you that opportunity , right ? , &quot; Perot said , smiling uneasily , as the audience continued booing . 
&quot; I ask you , as honest Christian people , to please go to the library and study the exit polls from the 1992 election . 
you will find I drew equally from both candidates , &quot; he said . 
coalition executive director Ralph Reed told the conference the upcoming election would test the moral fiber of the American people at a time of deep spiritual crisis . 
&quot; This election is not about a poverty in our pocketbooks , it is about a poverty in our souls , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s about the breakup of the family . 
the coarsening of our culture , a loss of civility , a loss of innocence , a loss of values and it is about a moral crisis that ails the heart and the soul of America , &quot; said Reed . 
he said the media would not tell the truth about Clinton &apos;s character so the Christian Coalition would fill the gulf . 
it would register one million voters in the next month and distribute 45 million voter guides through churches on the weekend before the election . 
some speakers seemed bemused by polls which show Clinton leading Dole by 15-20 percentage points with the election only 52 days away . 
in that poll , 66 percent of the people did not trust Bill Clinton but 56 percent of those people were going to vote for Bill Clinton , &quot; said Texas Representative Tom delay , the number three Republican in the House of Representatives . 
&quot; What do you call that ? 
I call that a so-what generation , &quot; he said of voters who disregarded what he viewed as Clinton &apos;s moral shortcomings . 
critics , including some religious activists , say the Christian Coalition has lost its own moral authority by turning itself into a power bloc within the Republican Party . 
&quot; There are many Christians in this land who don &apos;t subscribe to their agenda of electing as many right-wing Republicans as possible , &quot; said Jim Wallace , organiser of a rival evangelical conference in a nearby Washington hotel . 
Wallace said if Republicans lost badly in November , the Christian Coalition would get part of the blame . 
but Reed had a warning to fellow Republicans as well : &quot; If you want to retain control of the House and Senate , and you want to have any chance at all of gaining the White House , you had better not retreat from the pro-life and pro-family stands that made you a majority party in the first place . 
the conference began with an invocation by Pastor Laurence Haygood , founder of the Southern Community College in Tuskegee , Alabama , who told delegates God had commanded them to penetrate the soul of America and destroy the welfare state .
