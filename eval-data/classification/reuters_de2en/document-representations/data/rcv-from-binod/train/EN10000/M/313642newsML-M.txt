a temporary mismatch in funds availability pushed up the overnight rate to 8.00 / 40 percent against around 7.5 percent previously , dealers said on Thursday . 
they said a one billion ringgit payment for two Bank Negara bill issues on Wednesday against a maturity of 500 million ringgit had led to the rise in the overnight rate . 
&quot; Things should return to normal after the maturity of another 500 million ringgit on Friday , &quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank in Kuala Lumpur . 
he said the market remained flush on the back of funds coming in from overseas . 
earlier , other interbank rates were mostly steady . 
the dealers said the interbank rates were unaffected by the volatility in the overnight rate on Wednesday , when the overnight moved between 6.2 and 8.5 percent before closing at 7.5 percent . 
&quot; There is nothing new . 
funds are still floating around , particularly with foreign banks , &quot; said another local bank dealer . 
he said these foreign banks had internal restrictions on lending to some institutions considered high-risk borrowers in Malaysia , like finance companies and merchant banks . 
one-week money was at 7.10 / 20 percent , two-week at 7.10 / 20 , one- and three-month at 7.25 and six-month at 7.35 / 38 , all unchanged from their previous levels . 
dealers said dollar / ringgit movements continued to dictate trends in the local money market .
