Wellington , Sept 11 - King Country could be without up to four of their regular forward pack for Saturday &apos;s NPC first division rugby match against Otago in Dunedin , according to coach Stan Meads . 
prop Phil coffin , flanker Dean Anglesey and locks Glenn Stanton and Dion Waller are all in doubt for the match . 
Stanton is due to appear before the New Zealand Rugby Football Union judiciary tonight after being cited for punching All Blacks halfback Justin Marshall in the first half of last Friday &apos;s 27-38 loss to Canterbury at Lancaster Park . 
Marshall required medical treatment after the incident , which went undetected by match officials . 
Meads said he had no idea how Stanton would fare at the judiciary but he rated All Blacks front rower coffin , who has an infected ear , as a likely starter on Saturday . 
however Anglesey , who turned an ankle during training before last Friday &apos;s match , was only a 50-50 chance while lock Waller , who has been suffering migraine headaches , was uncertain . 
&quot; We just have to leave things as long as possible to see who &apos;s available , &quot; said Meads , whose side is under pressure after four straight losses in the NPC . 
&quot; We &apos;re flying down to Dunedin on Friday morning but we &apos;re training on Thursday night so we &apos;ll sort things out there . 
&quot; I think Phil coffin will be okay but it &apos;s just too hard with the others . 
at this stage , Meads has bracketed loose forward Richard Coventry with Stanton at lock , bringing in Romana Graham from the reserves bench at the back of the scrum , but has chosen to name his three injured forwards in the starting 15 . 
however , he said Selevi Tiatia would replace Anglesey on the side of the scrum while Coventry was a definite starter for the match and would probably play as blindside flanker if Stanton was cleared to play . 
on top of the injuries , Meads has also brought in Regan Sue at second five-eighths in place of Eric Henare and replaced hooker Cameron Herbert with Paul Mitchell . 
King Country ( likely ) : Phillipe Rayasi , Guy Curtis , Eddie Robinson , Dion Mathews , Regan Sue , Michael Blank , Chris wills , Romana Graham , Dean Anglesey / Selevi Tiatia , Glenn Stanton / Richard Coventry , Dion Waller , Glenn Corbett / Coventry , 
Joe Veitayaki , Paul Mitchell , Phil coffin . 
reserves : Lee Peina , Eric Henare , Fen Davis , Chris Vogl , Glen Mulgrew , Cameron Herbert .
