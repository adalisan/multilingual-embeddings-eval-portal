Zaire &apos;s veteran president , Mobutu Sese Seko , returned home on Tuesday to a rapturous welcome after four months in Europe where he had surgery for prostate cancer , witnesses said . 
up to 20,000 people gathered at the international airport in the capital Kinshasa to welcome home the man whose supporters describe him as the one symbol of unity in the anarchic Central African nation gripped by a revolt in the east . 
many thousands more lined the 15-km ( 10-miles ) from the capital to the airport . 
witnesses said Mobutu , 66 , smiled broadly as he walked down the steps from the aircraft with his wife as cheering , drumming , music and chanting sounded around the airport . 
wearing his trade-mark leopard-skin hat , he walked unaided and easily , carrying , as always , a carved walking stick . 
tight security surrounded the homecoming with snipers on rooftops and civil guard troops in trucks on the road from the capital . 
the crowds , some of them wearing imitation leopard-skin hats , surged forward as the plane taxied to a halt . 
Mobutu was handed a huge bouquet of flowers , shook hands all round and joined in singing the national anthem . 
the crowd erupted as he raised his arms in acknowledgement . 
Mobutu has dominated the life of the nation since seizing power in 1965 . 
he bowed to foreign and domestic pressure for democratic reforms in 1990 but elections have yet to be held . 
Mobutu has announced his intention to stand for elected office once multi-party elections finally take place . 
under the transitional constitution , this must now be before July 1997 .
