the Yugoslav army denied on Monday that it was split over support for Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic ( corrects by inserting dropped name ) in his dispute with the opposition as demonstrators hit the streets of Belgrade for the 43rd day . 
buoyed by an apparent statement of support from dissident army officers , the demonstrators renewed their demands that Milosevic recognise opposition wins in November &apos;s local elections . 
an unsigned and unauthenticated letter , read out before 50,000 opposition supporters on Sunday , warned Milosevic its authors , which apparently included men of the elite 63rd Paratroop Brigade , would refuse to fire on demonstrators if ordered to do so . 
the letter also warned the opposition Zajedno ( Together ) coalition that it too would be toppled in its turn if it became autocratic in power . 
but an official army statement later stressed its unity , though it made no pledge of loyalty to Milosevic who has struggled for six weeks to contain the protests that have paralysed Belgrade for more than six hours every day . 
the protest wave , made despite police moves to drive demonstrators off the main streets , is the most sustained popular push for democratisation in 50 years of leftist one-party rule in Serbia-led Yugoslavia . 
five thousand university students tried to march across the Sava River bridge on Monday but were blocked by police and forced to retreat into a pedestrian mall . 
later , tens of thousands of people backing Zajedno massed in Republic Square with riot police packing adjacent streets to prevent protesters swarming into traffic zones . 
Dejan Bulatovic , a Zajedno activist who had been beaten while in police custody , appeared at the rally after he was released on Monday having served 25 days in jail for carrying an effigy of Milosevic in prison garb . 
&quot; They are wrong if they think we have achieved nothing in these 41 days , &quot; one of Zajedno &apos;s leaders Zoran Djindjic told the crowd . 
&quot; We began by chasing a fox which stole our votes and ended up driving a dinosaur out of its lair . 
with the streets sealed off by the authorities , Zajedno also confined its now traditional march to the pedestrian mall , walking in circles and jeering at the cordons of riot police . 
up to a quarter of a million people have rallied daily in Serbia against Milosevic &apos;s annulment of November 17 municipal elections in 14 cities , including Belgrade , won by Zajedno . 
but Zajedno , supported later by findings of a special OSCE mission , accused the SPS of blatant vote fraud and demanded that its victories be reinstated . 
Zajedno prepared a street spectacle for Tuesday , New Year &apos;s Eve , to keep up the enthusiasm of supporters whose ranks have dwindled since subzero , snowy weather set in a week ago . 
a costume ball for children was scheduled followed by a midtown procession in mid-evening and then a huge party in Republic Square with well-known pop music groups and actors . 
Zajedno said &quot; tickets &quot; for the party would consist of candles , sparklers or alarm clocks timed to go off at the stroke of 12 in a humorous warning to strongman Milosevic . 
Serbian police banned street marches after a December 24 riot involving Zajedno protesters and government loyalists bused into Belgrade from the provinces to champion the beleaguered Serbian president . 
the reclusive Milosevic is now mulling how to respond to last week &apos;s critical report by a delegation from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 
Western governments have warned Milosevic he can forget about financial aid for Yugoslavia &apos;s wrecked economy unless he concedes electoral losses and starts broad democratic reform .
