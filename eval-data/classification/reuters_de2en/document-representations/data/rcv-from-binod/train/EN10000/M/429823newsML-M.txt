higher futures prices in Chicago and increases of as much as three stg a tonne in high pro prices on the UK meals and feeds market kept most buyers sidelined . 
&quot; People are beginning to realise that prices are not going to come down suddenly but that does not make them any keener to get involved , &quot; said one broker . 
&quot; We &apos;ve got some USDA figures due out on Tuesday and some people are holding on in case they make a dent in the market , but even if they do it will be only temporally , &quot; said another . 
high protein soymeal ex-mill Liverpool was offered three stg up while stores were one to three stg higher . 
Rapemeal ex-mill Erith was unchanged while resellers were unchanged to one stg up . 
Rapemeal from the Liverpool and Hull mills were unchanged to two stg higher . 
corn gluten feed pellets ex-store were around one to two stg up while sunflower meal ex-store and pellets ex-mill unchanged .
