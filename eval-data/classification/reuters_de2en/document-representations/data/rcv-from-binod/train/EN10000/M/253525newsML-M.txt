gold prices were steady on Thursday afternoon reflecting an even tone on the financial markets , dealers said . 
prices dipped about $ 1.00 in early trading to a low around $ 368 an ounce on moderate selling rumoured to originate from a gold producer , dealers said . 
&quot; But a few people liked it down there , and it had a modest bounce when bargain hunters came in , &quot; a dealer said , noting that the gold had found support around $ 368 an ounce . 
Bullion was fixed at $ 368.60 per ounce unchanged from the morning and compared to $ 368.25 on Wednesday afternoon . 
new York &apos;s February COMEX was modestly lower at the fixing at $ 370.30 down $ 0.30 versus forecasts of flat to plus $ 0.20 . 
volumes were relatively thin and trading subdued compared to the volatile trading seen recently . 
in the near term , dealers said , movements in the stock and bond markets would rule gold &apos;s roost . 
last Friday gold briefly soared to nearly $ 375 an ounce when a shake-down on Wall Street sent investors scurrying to the precious metals . 
European bourses were mixed and nervous , after renewed fears about interest rates caused a sharp fall in U.S. stocks on Wednesday . 
the dollar was firmer in Europe underpinned by softer U.S. November retail sales which posted a 0.4 percent drop against forecasts of minus 0.3 percent . 
the core Consumer Price Index was up 0.3 percent against a 0.2-percent forecast . 
&quot; Maybe 30 percent of the focus is on the metals and the other 70 percent is on the financial markets where selling could trigger movement in this market , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; There &apos;s a good chance of a rally in precious metals should financial markets make a serious reversal , &quot; he added . 
otherwise , the market was still bearish overall since tumbling to three-year lows last week on concerns about selling by producers and central banks combined with slack physical demand . 
some analysts forecast a drop to $ 360 an ounce . 
silver and platinum were closely shadowing gold and were indicated little changed from London &apos;s closing levels . 
silver was unchanged at $ 4.82 / $ 4.84 an ounce , while platinum was down $ 0.25 at $ 368.00 / $ 369.00 . 
palladium , which had been edging up steadily this week , was slightly easier at $ 118.45 / $ 119.45 .
