Canadian bonds ended weaker on Thursday , softening along with U.S. treasuries amid strong U.S. economic data the lingering effect of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s hawkish public testimony , analysts said . 
&quot; We saw quite a bit of curve flattening going on ( earlier ) , but when the U.S. deteriorated at midday , our whole market just deteriorated with them including long bonds , &quot; said Will Sutherland , vice-president of fixed-income with Altamira Investment Services . 
the U.S. 30-year benchmark bond fell 14 / 32 to yield 6.81 percent . 
the spread between the benchmark bonds was 26 basis points at Wednesday &apos;s close . 
Canadian and U.S. fixed-income prices tumbled on Wednesday after Greenspan testified to the U.S. Congress that a pre-emptive interest rate hike aimed at controlling inflation could not be ruled out . 
both markets extended losses this morning as stronger-than-expected U.S. durable goods orders data added to concern about a possible rate rise in the near term in the United States , analysts said . 
Sutherland said Greenspan &apos;s comments raised the question of how the Bank of Canada of would respond to a rate hike by the Fed . 
as a result many investors moved further up the yield curve early in the session .
