the government of the Central African Republic and army mutineers agreed a 15-day truce on Sunday after mediation by African heads of state to halt a slide into ethnic bloodshed , a spokesman for the mutineers said . 
the deal was signed during lengthy talks at the French embassy and the French ambassador &apos;s residence in the capital Bangui , the spokesman told Reuters . 
the presidents of Gabon , Burkina Faso , Mali and Chad , mandated by last week &apos;s Franco-African summit , began meeting the mutineers and other parties to the conflict on Saturday . 
the spokesman said under the deal , Mali &apos;s former military leader General Amadou Toumani Toure , one of a handful of African leaders to hand over power voluntarily , would examine the causes of the crisis . 
the revolt , the third of the year in the impoverished former French colony , began on November 16 over pay demands and an attempt by President Ange-Felix Patasse to redeploy soldiers involved in a May revolt . 
it has turned into an attempt to force Patasse , a civilian who was elected in 1993 , to step down . 
Mutineers , who first revolted over pay in April , control parts of Bangui . 
troops from former colonial power France , which intervened in May to keep Patasse in power during a second mutiny , guard strategic points in Bangui with presidential guard and army loyalists . 
the spokesman for the mutineers , who put the death toll on all sides at 150 since the latest mutiny began , said Sunday &apos;s talks began at 11 a.m. and lasted late into the afternoon . 
France &apos;s ambassador sat in . 
captain Anicet Saulett , leader of the mutineers , told Reuters before Sunday &apos;s talks the resignation of Patasse and the departure of what mutineers say are Chadian and Sudanese mercenaries in his pay were non-negotiable . 
Burkina Faso &apos;s president , Blaise Compaore , left for home before Sunday &apos;s talks started . 
Bangui residents have reported a spate of tribal killings and abductions pitting southern Yakomas who dominate the rebel ranks against Patasse &apos;s northern Bayas . 
precise numbers have proved difficult to verify but victims include former interior minister Christophe Grelombe , a Yakoma , and his son , who were seized on Thursday and murdered . 
eleven opposition parties have signed a memorandum blaming Patasse for the turmoil and accusing him of ignoring accords that ended the May mutiny . 
&quot; He is no longer in a position to embody national unity , &quot; they said . 
Gabon &apos;s president , Omar Bongo , said after meeting Patasse on Saturday that Africans had to sort out the crisis . 
&quot; The Central African Republic must not become another Rwanda , a Somalia , a Liberia or a Sierra Leone , &quot; he told French radio . 
Bangui remained tense but calm on Sunday following isolated overnight gunshots . 
markets stayed closed . 
France has expressed support for the elected government but President Jacques Chirac said its troops based in the country under defence pacts would not help it combat the mutineers . 
&quot; French troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities , &quot; he told reporters after the Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso .
