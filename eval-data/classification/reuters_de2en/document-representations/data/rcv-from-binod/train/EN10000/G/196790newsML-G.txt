the president of the European parliament , voicing shame at his German homeland &apos;s Nazi past , told Israel &apos;s legislature on Monday the Jewish state must surmount historic enmities and honour peace deals with the PLO . 
&quot; I am deeply moved , but also not without a sense of shame that this honour and this trust is conferred on a German , &quot; Klaus Hansch opened his remarks to Israel &apos;s Knesset . 
declaring Europe &apos;s support for Israel to be &quot; unswerving &quot; , Hansch urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s rightist government to implement interim peace accords signed by the previous administration . 
&quot; The international community expects that those agreements be honoured ... international commitments your state has made are not affected by a change in majorities , &quot; Hansch said . 
&quot; It is the living proof that in Europe the enmities of the past have been overcome , not through forgetting the bitter lessons of past conflict ... but through understanding them and learning from them , &quot; he told parliament , saying Israelis and Arabs could emulate Europe &apos;s example . 
Israeli-PLO talks on a long-delayed redeployment in Hebron agreed by the former government are stalemated over Netanyahu &apos;s insistence the signed deal be altered to safeguard the some 400 Jews in the heart of the West Bank town of 100,000 Palestinians . 
&quot; The future of Hebron was settled by the Oslo agreements , &quot; Klaus said . 
Klaus said the presence of some 130,000 Jewish settlers amidst more than two million Palestinians in occupied Arab lands posed a &quot; human problem that must be addressed &quot; . 
no one , he said , would benefit if Israel followed the &quot; dead-end street of more illegal settlements &quot; . 
citing Europe &apos;s role as the largest provider of economic assistance to the Palestinians , Hansch urged Israel to ease its crippling economic closure of Palestinian self-rule areas . 
&quot; The path to prosperity for the Palestinians requires open borders . 
he said Israel &apos;s closure of the areas , meant to prevent suicide bombers from infiltrating the Jewish state , was only a &quot; short-term security measure &quot; and &quot; unfettered economic investment &quot; would help cement peace .
