Hungary &apos;s government bond yields on the secondary market were stable or slightly lower this week , reflecting the changes of yields at the past two weeks &apos; Treasury bill and bond auctions , dealers said . 
&quot; yields went down by maximum 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points in the past two weeks . 
the Government Debt Managament Agency auctions Treasury bills and bonds which then trade mainly in the telephone over-the-counter market , and partly on the Budapest Stock Exchange and in the price quotation system on Reuters pages . 
the yields of discount Treasury bills , the maturities of which range from one month to twelve months , remained almost steady this week and dropped only by a maximum 0.06 percent at five of the past two weeks &apos; six auctions . 
the auction of two-year government bonds last Thursday also underlined a basicly declining trend , dealers said . 
the yield of the two-year papers dropped to 23.10 percent from 23.34 percent from an auction two weeks before . 
dealers said they did not see factors to change yields on the government bond market substantially next week , and the yields can move a little either downwards or upwards . 
&quot; There will not be radical change next week , perhaps one or two tenth of a percent , &quot; Fekete said .
