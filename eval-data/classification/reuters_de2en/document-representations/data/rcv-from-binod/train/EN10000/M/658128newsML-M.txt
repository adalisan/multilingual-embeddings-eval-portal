the Malaysian ringgit jumped on the back of heavy commercial dollar sales out of Kuala Lumpur , which triggered stop-loss dollar selling , dealers said on Thursday . 
&quot; A petrol company in KL was selling a good amount of dollars from the 2.5160 level this morning and went to a high of 2.5100 . 
then all the KL corporates came in to sell as well , &quot; a U.S. bank dealer in Singapore said . 
he said the dollar was likely to be supported by corporate demand around 2.5070 / 80 ringgit for the time being . 
the ringgit was quoted at 2.5100 / 10 to the dollar at 0425 GMT after rising to a high of 2.5080 against 2.5148 / 53 at the Kuala Lumpur close on Wednesday . 
dealers said the dollar sales were believed to be part of the continued conversion of funds raised by an oil company from a dollar Eurobond issue . 
the ringgit &apos;s sudden rise also triggered stop-loss dollar sales around 2.5100 , they said . 
&quot; A lot of interbank players were caught long dollar and were unwinding their positions , &quot; a dealer with a Malaysian bank said . 
the ringgit &apos;s sharp rise knocked some wind out of the Singapore dollar but dealers said its weakness would be limited . 
&quot; ringgit / sing moved up because dollar / ringgit was sold so dollar / sing followed but we should see some ( dollar ) selling interest around 1.4230 / 50 , &quot; a dealer said . 
the Thai baht continued to show a firm bias as players sought funds to cover maturing short positions amid signs the central bank &apos;s capital controls would stay in place for the foreseeable future . 
dealers said a move by the central Bank of Thailand ( Bot ) to plug a loophole foreigners were using to raise baht funds through the stock market had increased demand for baht in the offshore market . 
&quot; There may have been a lot of people expecting to get baht from the stock market who now can &apos;t , &quot; the Singapore-based U.S. bank dealer said . 
the Bot said on Tuesday that non-resident investors selling Thai stocks would have to remit funds in foreign currencies in a bid to deny speculators access to baht funds . 
it also asked bank custodians not to accept transfers of borrowed and unpaid stocks from foreigners . 
&quot; There were people in London who couldn &apos;t make payments on positions maturing yesterday . 
they were charged very expensive overdraft rates : Tom / next jumped to 25 / 50 at one point , &quot; the Singapore dealer said . 
he said the dollar had been sold down to a low of 23.70 on Thursday , from where it was bid back up by speculators . 
the dollar should find some temporary support near its low but was likely to remain under pressure as many positions established when the baht came under speculative assault in mid-May were maturing over the next few days , he added . 
the Indonesian rupiah had a sluggish morning but dealers said offshore players continued to favour long forward positions while local investors shorted the rupiah in the forward market . 
a Japanese bank dealer in Jakarta said the underlying tone suggested offshore players remained unhappy with developments in Thailand although the Indonesian central bank has said it did not plan to copy Thai steps to squeeze offshore players in the swap market . 
a European bank dealer said the dollar / rupiah rate was likely to range between 2,425.0 and 2,430.0 in the short-term , with the dollar seen top heavy at the 2,430.0 level . 
spot rupiah was at 2,427.0 / 29.0 at 0425 GMT , compared with an opening of 2,428.5 / 29.5 . 
the European bank dealer said forward rates were likely to decline if Thai authorities dismantled their two-tier market . 
&quot; I think six-month swaps could collapse to the 70 level if that happens , &quot; he said , citing the ample rupiah market .
