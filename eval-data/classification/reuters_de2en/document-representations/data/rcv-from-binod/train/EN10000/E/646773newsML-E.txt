Brazilian industrial production in April rose 3.5 percent from March , and increased 7.9 percent in comparison with April last year , the government &apos;s National Statistics Institute ( IBGE ) said . 
the IBGE said industrial production in April reached its highest level since April 1995 . 
&quot; The strong growth achieved by industry from March to April this year is partly the result of fewer working days in March , &quot; the IBGE said . 
industrial production in the first four months of 1997 grew 5.5 percent , while in the last 12 months output rose 5.9 percent , the IBGE said . 
production in April increased in 16 of the 20 industrial sectors covered by the IBGE survey , with beverages showing the largest growth at 21.4 percent , followed by furniture at 15.1 percent and wood products at 13.2 percent .
