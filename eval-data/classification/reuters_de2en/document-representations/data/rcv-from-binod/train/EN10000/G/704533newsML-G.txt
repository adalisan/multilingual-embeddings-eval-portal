President Biljana Plavsic ordered the immediate dissolution of the Bosnian Serb parliament on Thursday to prevent hardliners using their majority to vote for her dismissal . 
the dissolution order was read out by an senior aide at the presidency building in the northern town of Banja Luka after Plavsic ignored a claim by hardliners that she was over-stepping her constitutional rights . 
hardliners loyal to former president and indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic have called a meeting of the parliament on Friday to try to topple Plavsic . 
Karadzic aide Momcilo Krajisnik wrote to Plavsic earlier on Thursday to say she could not dissolve parliament without the support of its president and Prime Minister Goran Klickovic , both hardliners opposed to her . 
political sources said it was unlikely the hardline faction which leads the ruling SDS party in the Bosnian Serb republic would heed the dissolution . 
Plavsic told reporters she had set September 1 as the date for elections for a new parliament . 
the dissolution document accused the interior ministry run by police chief Dragan Kijac of &quot; organising criminal acts &quot; and smuggling with the Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia . 
it said Klickovic refused to cooperate with Plavsic and that the present parliament was ignoring &quot; a serious crisis jeopardising the security of the republic . 
Plavsic claimed the political chaos put the Bosnian Serb republic at a disadvantage in the post-war peace process .
