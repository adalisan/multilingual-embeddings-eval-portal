Canada was sending an advance team to Zaire on Thursday to assess the dire situation in Central Africa and it announced that Lt. Gen. Maurice Baril will command a multinational humanitarian relief force . 
defence Department spokesman Capt. 
Ian Stock said the advance team would have between 24 and 30 members , some of whom would come from the special Disaster Assistance Response Team ( DART ) formed by the Canadian military to provide humanitarian relief at home and abroad . 
&quot; They basically have to assess the situation and come back and make recommendations , &quot; Stock said . 
he said he did not know how long they would stay in Zaire but the main multinational force would not leave for Africa until the team was back . 
Canada last weekend offered to lead a multinational relief force to help more than a million mainly Hutu refugees in Zaire who face hunger and disease after being displaced by weeks of fighting between Tutsi rebels and the Zairean army . 
the United States agreed in principle on Wednesday to participate in the force , which will number around 10,000 troops , of which 1,500 will be Canadian . 
the mission was expected to last four to six months but the U.N. special envoy to the region , Canadian Ambassador Raymond Chretien , said on Wednesday he expected troops will have to remain in Central Africa longer than that . 
Baril , the commander of Canada &apos;s land forces , will lead the operation , Defence Minister Doug Young said on Thursday . 
he has served as the military adviser to United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and is considered Canada &apos;s top soldier . 
he has been widely tipped to succeed Gen. Jean Boyle , Canada &apos;s former chief of defence staff who resigned last month over an investigation into atrocities committed by Canadian peacekeepers during a 1993 mission in Somalia . 
the choice of Baril , who has experience serving with a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Cyprus , to lead the relief force demonstrates Canada &apos;s desire to restore its image as one of the world &apos;s leading peacekeeping nations -- an image that was tarnished by the Somalia mission . 
Baril , 52 , has served in the military for 35 years , some of which he spent in the elite Canadian airborne Regiment , which was disbanded in disgrace following the Somalia mission and several other incidents . 
the international community , under enormous pressure to help alleviate the crisis , is at a loss over how to avoid a re-run of 1994 problems when it effectively fed and gave sanctuary to many of those , primarily Hutus , responsible for the slaughter of an estimated 800,000 people , mainly Tutsis , in Rwanda . 
that mission was also under Canadian command .
