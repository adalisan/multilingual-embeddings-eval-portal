Belarussian Prime Minister Mikhail Chigir has threatened to resign if President Alexander Lukashenko goes ahead with a November 24 referendum to increase his powers , the deputy speaker of parliament said on Monday . 
Gennady Karpenko , speaking to reporters after meeting Chigir with other parliamentary leaders , quoted the premier as saying he would resign unless Lukashenko agreed to a list of conditions . 
&quot; Chigir has set the president economic and political conditions including cancelling the referendum , &quot; Karpenko said . 
Chigir , emerging from the meeting , neither confirmed nor denied he had resigned , saying : &quot; Not so fast , not so fast &quot; . 
Lukashenko has defied rising opposition from parliament , the constitutional court and other bodies but so far only one or two junior members of his government have resigned . 
Chigir &apos;s departure would be a big blow to Lukashenko . 
he was appointed prime minister after Lukashenko &apos;s landslide election win in July 1994 and is seen as a presidential loyalist . 
Lukashenko was due to attend a campaign rally in Gomel , southern Belarus , near the Ukrainian border , on Monday .
