European bourses climbed sharply in early trading on Friday with Frankfurt again hitting a new peak as the stronger dollar held out improved prospects for exporters . 
Paris stocks rose to their highest level of the year as investors hoped for a speedy end to the French truckers &apos; strike and drew comfort from the dollar &apos;s gains and higher bond prices . 
on currency markets the dollar rose against the mark as traders fretted about growing tension between France and Germany over exchange rates and monetary policy . 
German stocks were the stars . 
the DAX index , which closed at a record high on Thursday , soared nearly one percent to an intra-day peak of 2843.38 points because of the dollar and stronger government bonds . 
&quot; Everything looks perfect , both the bond and the dollar . 
we could keep climbing , &quot; said one trader . 
in Paris , stocks climbed over 0.8 percent to 2309.02 on the blue-chip CAC-40 in early transactions , eclipsing the previous intra-day high for 1996 of 2,295.54 . 
&quot; The bourse is feeling very bullish , &quot; a trader said , amid signs of optimism over the 12-day-old truckers &apos; blockade . 
French junior transport minister Anne-Marie Idrac said on Friday the government will sign a decree defining working hours for truckers in a bid to end the crippling dispute . 
the sparkling performances in Paris and Frankfurt followed the German bourse &apos;s record close and a surge by French stocks on Thursday after comments by a Bank of France policymaker pushed the dollar higher against the franc and the mark . 
Bank of France monetary policy council member Jean-Pierre Gerard said in an interview with Le Monde he wanted a stronger dollar against the mark , implying a desire for a weaker franc . 
one way to get the dollar higher would be to cut short-term rates in France and Germany , making equities more attractive . 
in London , shares edged cautiously higher at the start of trading Friday after Thursday &apos;s late rally sparked by renewed bid speculation . 
traders said activity was likely to be muted in the absence of a fresh lead from Wall Street , closed yesterday for the thanksgiving day holiday . 
yet there were hopes that the FTSE index , which on Tuesday touched a record intraday high , is still set for its traditional year-end rally . 
&quot; My feeling is this market wants to go better , &quot; said the head of sales trading at one brokerage . 
&quot; The market is nervous but with fund managers holding plenty of cash , the likelihood is it will respond more aggressively to good news rather than bad . 
the debate on exchange rates was the main focus in currency markets , where the dollar climbed to 1.5365 marks from 1.5320 in late Europe on Thursday . 
&quot; What we are seeing is a questioning of the central plank of French macroeconomic policy of the last 10 years . 
it &apos;s a very fundamental issue , &quot; said Paul Meggyesi , senior currency strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
&quot; In the short term , the dollar will continue to derive some encouragement from this uncertainty about European exchange-rate policy , &quot; he said . 
Meggyesi said because Germany is unlikely explicitly to adopt a policy of devaluation , the uncertainty over exchange rate policy will provide only short-term dollar support . 
the dollar was quoted at 113.67 yen and 1.5365 marks against 113.61 yen and 1.5320 marks in late Europe on Thursday . 
the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 8.6 points at 4,058.8 . 
in Paris , the CAC-40 share index was up 18.23 at 2,308.54 . 
gold was lower in early European trade at $ 371.85 an ounce , compared with $ 372.70 at the London close on Thursday . 
silver was at $ 4.73 , versus $ 4.74 .
