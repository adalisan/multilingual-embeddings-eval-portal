China &apos;s stock markets are likely to rise or at least stick to current levels over the next month on confidence in the economy and the business prospects of many listed firms in 1997 , analysts said on Monday . 
stock analysts have predicted overall improved results for listed companies in 1996 after two dismal years resulting from a national credit squeeze , and many B share companies have risen sharply in recent weeks in anticipation . 
the markets have also reacted positively to the calm way in which investors and the country as a whole handled the death of China &apos;s paramount leader Deng Xiaoping last month , they said . 
&quot; Confidence in China &apos;s economy will propel stock prices in the next month , &quot; said a Shenzhen-based stock analyst with China &apos;s J &amp; A Securities Co . 
the optimistic mood and the buoyancy of prices has caused concern amongst some investors that the government may step in with some anti-speculative measures to cool things down . 
&quot; The next week or two depends on what the government decides to do with speculation , &quot; said a trader with the Central-South Securities Co . &quot; But I think underlying optimism over China &apos;s economy will keep the A and B indices at least around current levels . 
&quot; People are watching closely for a possible new clampdown on stock speculation , &quot; a Shenzhen-based analyst with China Guotai Securities agreed . 
&quot; If it comes , it will drive stocks down , but the downward pressure will be countered by the positive long-term eoncomic outlook , &quot; he added . 
Alex Conroy , an analyst in Shanghai with ING-Barings , said the expectation was for better B share company results this year , but pointed out almost all of the B share results have yet to be released . 
&quot; We &apos;re getting cautious , &quot; Conroy said . 
&quot; Everyone is expecting things to get better this year , but expectations may have accelerated ahead of reality . 
everything is priced quite high at the moment . 
market tone has been improved by a number of factors , analysts say -- the way the country handled the death of Deng , the handover of Hong Kong to China from Britain in mid-year and a sense that the economy is picking up . 
&quot; The unexpectedly calm response of the stock markets to Deng &apos;s death will be a key factor helping share prices to rise over the next month , &quot; said a Shanghai-based Chinese broker . 
&quot; The return of Hong Kong in July is also a mid-term positive factor . 
Shanghai &apos;s foreign currency B share index closed on Monday at 70.898 points , up 8.86 percent from its close on February 19 , the day of Deng &apos;s death . 
the domestic A share index gained 23.39 percent to 1,212.753 points over the same period . 
in Shenzhen , the B share index rose 19.9 percent to 169.99 points and the A index gained 18.3 percent to 423.68 points between February 19 and the close on Monday . 
&quot; The rises in the past few weeks have greatly strengthened market sentiment and there is still potential for further rises in the next month , &quot; said a manager with a major Chinese brokerage . 
&quot; I would say a five to 10 percent increase in each of the indices is attainable , &quot; he added . 
but ING-Barings &apos; Conroy said the expected upturn in the economy was slow in becoming evident in terms of increased orders for listed companies . 
&quot; This is the year of the economy picking up , but we haven &apos;t seen a lot of pick-up in the economy so far , &quot; she said . 
&quot; Chinese New Year as an excuse is gone , and we &apos;re still looking . 
the longer it takes to come , the more cautious we are going to get .
