soymeal basis levels were mostly steady on Friday in quiet conditions with crushers preoccupied with buying soybeans following a sharp run-up in CBOT futures prices , soymeal dealers said . 
&quot; I &apos;m buying a lot of soybeans this morning but it is not too easy to sell the product $ 10.00 up , &quot; one Indiana-based crusher source said . 
CBOT soybeans and meal touched their respectively 30 cents a bushel and $ 10.00 per ton limits in key months Friday following bullish U.S. stocks and production data issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture . 
cash sources also noted crushings continued at a fast pace with weekly data issued by the National oilseed Processors Association showing only a marginal decline to 30.48 million bushels , down from 30.54 million a week earlier . 
diminishing margins were , however , expected to start slowing crushing operations shortly , they added .
