the allegations against independent senator Mal Colston need to be watched carefully , because if they ultimately forced his departure that would almost destroy the government &apos;s ability to pursue economic reform . 
a former staff member has accused Colston in a government administrative tribunal of , among other things , dealing improperly with an expense allowance and giving office jobs to relatives who did not actually work . 
but Colston , on whom the government often relies to get contentious legislation through the Senate , denies any wrongdoing . 
government officials say the Australian Federal Police are looking at some of the allegations to determine whether an investigation is warranted although they are not actually investigating . 
much is at stake here , and it is not premature to consider the implications if Colston were ultimately convicted . 
here are the essential points : 
section 44 of the Constitution disqualifies from sitting in parliament anyone convicted of a serious offense , which is defined as one carrying a year &apos;s jail . 
that suggests that a successful prosecution of Colston might create a casual vacancy -- a senator &apos;s departure between elections . 
section 15 of the Constitution tells the parliament or government of the relevant state to fill a casual vacancy with someone from the party the senator represented when elected . 
the party can veto the choice by expelling the member before he or she takes a place as a senator . 
Colston is an independent , but he was a Labor candidate when elected . 
he has been an independent only since budget day last year , when his defection suddenly gave the government hope of getting its contentious fiscal measures through the Senate . 
so if Colston were to depart , Queensland would have to replace him with a Labor member accepted by the Labor Party , changing fine balance of numbers in the senate . 
( by an entertaining co-incidence , this procedure was inserted into the constitution to prevent a state from choosing someone against the wishes of the relevant party , as the Queensland state government did in 1975 , sparking that year &apos;s constitutional crisis . 
then Queensland premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen had rejected Labor &apos;s candidate , Mal Colston . 
the Senate has 76 members , of whom 37 are members of the Liberal-National coalition . 
if the other independent senator , Brian Harradine , backs the Liberal-Nationals then the government has 38 votes -- exactly half . 
but half is not good enough to get legislation through the Senate , because a positive action ( say , to pass legislation ) requires a majority . 
so the government needs Colston to get anything past the fairly solid leftist bloc of Labor , Democrats and Greens . 
on the other hand , 38 votes control the Senate if there are only 75 senators , as there would be between the time a senator departed and the time a replacement was sworn in . 
interestingly , the constitution does not impose a time limit on a state filling a casual vacancy . 
Australian National University constitutional lawyer George Williams said the timing would have to be resolved politically . 
Colston is from Queensland , which has a Liberal-National government . 
if he departed , that government might not hurry to replace him . 
but once a new Labor senator were in place the federal government &apos;s position in the Senate would be quite difficult . 
the Greens very rarely agree with any contentious government measure . 
if Labor also opposes a measure then the government must rely on the Australian Democrats , who have been in a very bad mood since Colston &apos;s August defection largely cut them out of Senate deals . 
certainly the Democrats rarely see wisdom in anything conventionally regarded as an economic reform . 
it is likely , then , that Colston &apos;s departure would ultimately undermine the government &apos;s capacity to press contentious measures through the parliament , largely ruling out further significant economic reform before the next election .
