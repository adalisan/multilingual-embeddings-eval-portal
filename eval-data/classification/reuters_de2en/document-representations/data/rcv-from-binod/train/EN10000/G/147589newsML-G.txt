a California man has been arrested for running a three-year scheme that allowed people to cheat on required graduate school admission exams by using pencils encoded with the answers , federal prosecutors said on Monday . 
George Kobayashi , 45 , of Arcadia , California , was arrested on Saturday on two fraud charges filed in Manhattan federal court alleging he operated his test-cheating scheme from November 1993 until the present . 
if convicted of the two charges , Kobayashi faces a possible maximum prison term of 10 years and fines of $ 500,000 . 
according to the complaint , Kobayashi &apos;s company &quot; American Test Center &quot; advertised a &quot; unique &quot; method of preparing students for graduate admission tests for a charge of $ 6,000 . 
shortly before taking tests , applicants were provided with correct answers in code on pencils that test-takers carried into the exam with them , prosecutors alleged . 
Kobayashi ran his scheme by having a team of experts take each exam in New York City using assumed names . 
the actual &quot; test-takers &quot; who hired Kobayashi &apos;s company were instructed to fly to Los Angeles to take the exam . 
relying on the three-hour time difference , the experts telephoned the correct answers to Kobayashi &apos;s office in Los Angeles where the answers were quickly coded onto pencils by Kobayashi &apos;s employees and then provided to the test-takers , the complaint alleged . 
the scam was witnessed by an undercover federal investigator who employed Kobayashi &apos;s services and flew to Los Angeles to take the GMAT on Oct . 19 . 
&quot; This defendant enriched himself by playing on the insecurities of young people at an anxious time in their lives , &quot; said Mary Jo White , Manhattan U.S. attorney .
