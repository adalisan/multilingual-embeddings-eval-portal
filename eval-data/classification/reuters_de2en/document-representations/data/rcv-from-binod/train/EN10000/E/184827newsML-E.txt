prices at the wholesale level rose at their fastest pace in seven months in October , the government said Wednesday , fuelled by a jump in food and energy costs in an otherwise tame inflation report . 
the Labour Department said the Producer Price Index rose 0.4 percent after rising 0.2 percent in September . 
but excluding often volatile food and energy prices , the so-called core rate actually fell 0.3 percent after rising the same amount the prior month . 
&quot; It &apos;s wonderful , &quot; Philip Braverman , chief economist at DKB Securities , said of the report , which was released just before the Federal Reserve &apos;s policy-makers began meeting to discuss the future course of interest rates . 
most analysts predicted the central bank policy-makers would leave rates unchanged . 
&quot; It certainly is making life easier at the Federal Reserve , &quot; said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co . , one of those who thought the Fed would stand pat . 
analysts had estimated that producer prices overall rose 0.2 percent in October and the core rate edged up 0.1 percent . 
the department said the rise in the overall index was the biggest since March , when it rose 0.5 percent . 
the decline in the core rate was the largest since a 0.4 percent drop in October 1994 . 
&quot; The number came in even weaker than we had anticipated , &quot; said Sally Kleinman , senior economist at Chase Securities Inc . &quot; We got a pickup in food and energy prices , but that wasn &apos;t enough to increase the core rate , which dropped . 
while the rise in the overall rate may be seen as a sign of a pickup in inflation , most analysts were not alarmed . 
&quot; The inflation alarmists can point to the 0.4 percent rise ... while those who feel inflationary pressures remain benign or even nonexistent can back their arguments , &quot; said Joel Naroff of First Union . 
&quot; When the dust settles , I think people will talk about this report as favourable , &quot; said Dan Seto , senior economist at Nikko Securities Co International Inc . 
the department said food prices rose 0.8 percent in October , compared with a 0.2 percent rise in September , led by higher prices for meat , fish and vegetables . 
energy prices jumped 1.9 percent after rising 0.2 percent in September , led by gasoline , up 5.5 percent , and heating oil , up 3.8 percent . 
energy prices have been rising on strong global demand as economies overseas gained strength . 
passenger car prices , however , fell 1.6 percent in October after jumping 1.2 percent the prior month . 
Brett Graff , an economist with the Department &apos;s Bureau of Labour Statistics , noted that passenger cars make up 11.1 percent of the closely watched core rate of producer prices . 
she said that seasonal factors were at play in the decline in passenger car prices . 
the introduction of new car models typically causes car prices to rise late in the year but the timing of model introductions can affect month-to-month changes in the passenger car price index . 
big decreases in prices of light and heavy motor trucks also helped pull the core PPI lower , Graff said . 
light truck prices fell 1.2 percent , while heavy trucks fell 4.4 percent . 
there was little in the report pointing to inflationary pressures building in the manufacturing chain . 
prices of intermediate goods -- those that require further processing -- were unchanged last month after increasing 0.3 percent in September while raw materials prices fell 0.6 percent .
