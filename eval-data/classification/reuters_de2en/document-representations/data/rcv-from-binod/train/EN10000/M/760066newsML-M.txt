a healthy dose of &quot; rational exuberance &quot; has spilled over from buoyant stock and bond markets , sending the dollar sharply higher against a broad group of currencies and causing many forecasters to rethink just how high the U.S. unit can climb . 
only one week ago , many viewed the greenback &apos;s climb as a function of mark weakness . 
doubts about the strength and makeup of Europe &apos;s planned single currency and stubbornly sluggish German economic growth had weighed on the mark throughout the first half of the year . 
the Fed Chairman suggested last Tuesday that the economy might be undergoing some &quot; basic improvements &quot; thanks to technological advances that were boosting worker productivity and corporate profits . 
a &quot; Brave New World &quot; economy , in which companies are able to produce better products at lesser cost , promises continued U.S. export competitiveness regardless of the stronger dollar . 
it also keeps hopes for strong profits and low inflation alive -- a formula for the robust stock and bond markets that have attracted massive international capital inflows and supported the dollar &apos;s ascendance . 
&quot; In the final analysis , the dollar is at least in part a function of the value that people attribute to American financial assets , &quot; said Robert Hormats , vice chairman at Goldman Sachs . 
&quot; If you say to yourself that American financial assets are likely to be very strong , as they have been and look like they will continue to be , you have one more reason to buy dollars . 
betting against the soaring dollar has proved extremely unwise for traders of late . 
on Monday , bullish momentum swept the greenback near the 1.85 mark threshold -- its highest level against the German currency in over seven and a half years . 
the dollar was also perched at its top level against the Swiss franc in four years , a 10-week peak versus the yen and a six-week high against the pound . 
dealers say the dollar could now begin playing &quot; catch-up &quot; against these currencies , striving to match the gains it has made against the mark in recent months . 
&quot; We are starting to see currencies other than the mark lose value against the dollar , and if that continues we have to admit to ourselves that we &apos;re in a straight dollar trend , which would be something fairly new , &quot; said John Hazelton , chief dealer at Manufacturers and Traders Bank . 
many analysts see little reason why the dollar cannot shoot as high as 2.0 marks , which would represent its highest level since before the dismantling of the Berlin Wall in late 1989 . 
while the dollar / yen rate has become highly politicized because of Japan &apos;s large trade surplus , U.S. officials have voiced no objections to dollar / mark &apos;s rise . 
and German officials , who see the export-led growth benefits that a weaker mark affords , have been careful not to come out too strongly in defense of their slumping currency . 
ultimately , tighter German monetary policy would be necessary to reverse dollar / mark &apos;s upward trajectory , dealers said . 
but higher interest rates could also derail the entire monetary union process . 
&quot; betting against a stronger dollar has been pretty costly , &quot; said BZW &apos;s Iggo . 
&quot; The Bundesbank complaints about the strong dollar have been rather half-hearted so far , we haven &apos;t heard anything from the U.S. and nobody else seems to care . 
but Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to Congress last week changed a few minds about the dollar &apos;s potential . 
&quot; Greenspan legitimized the bullishness in all the U.S. markets , &quot; said Chris Iggo , chief economist at BZW Securities . 
&quot; Stocks , bonds and the dollar have all gone up and you can really trace that back to this new thinking on what is driving the economy .
