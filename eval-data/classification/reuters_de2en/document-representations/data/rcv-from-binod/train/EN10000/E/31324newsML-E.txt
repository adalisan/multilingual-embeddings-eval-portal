a bitter dispute over water sharing , a trade gap and New Delhi &apos;s plea for transport links through Bangladesh will dominate the Indian foreign minister &apos;s visit to Dhaka this week , officials said on Wednesday . 
they said Dhaka would strongly plead for an immediate end to the water dispute that has long affected the lives of about 40 million Bangladeshis . 
&quot; We will be seeking a long-term agreement with India by next December , &quot; one foreign ministry official said . 
Gujral is due to arrive in Dhaka on Friday on a four-day visit to neighbouring Bangladesh . 
he will be the highest level official to visit Dhaka since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina took office in June . 
&quot; The prime issue of his talks with his Bangladeshi counterpart will be the sharing of water . 
other issues likely to feature are the proposal for transit and narrowing down of the trade gap , &quot; one South Asian diplomat said . 
&quot; Things appear to be moving towards a solution , but the water agreement will come first , &quot; he told Reuters . 
Bangladeshi officials declined to specify what issues Gujral would discuss with his counterpart Abdus Samad Azad . 
sharing of water , especially from the Ganges river , called Padma in Bangladesh , has long been a major irritant . 
Dhaka says India &apos;s Farakka barrage , 18 km ( 12 miles ) from Bangladesh &apos;s northern border , obstructs the river &apos;s flow and deprives this country of its fair share of water . 
officials say more than 40 million people in northwestern Bangladesh have faced gradual desertification of their land since the Farakka was commissioned in 1974 . 
India has said it favoured a concrete solution to the water dispute . 
the latest water sharing agreement expired in 1988 and attempts to renew it have since failed . 
Indian exports to Bangladesh are worth $ 1 billion a year , while India imports goods worth only $ 50 million a year from its neighbour , trade officials in New Delhi said .
