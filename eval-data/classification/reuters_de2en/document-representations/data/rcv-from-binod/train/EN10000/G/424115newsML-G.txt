four New York schoolchildren were crushed to death and six people injured when high winds sent a huge maple tree crashing into a van that was taking them to school on Thursday , officials said . 
the dead children were all girls between the ages of 10 and 13 , and the injured passengers were being treated in the hospital , police and fire officials said . 
&quot; We used the jaws of life and then the Emergency Medical Service personnel went into the van to check on the victims , and then we cut the tree in pieces to get it off the van , &quot; said John McCormack , deputy chief of the New York City Fire Department . 
two adults and four children were injured and taken to the hospital , officials said . 
an EMS spokesman said all the injuries were minor and did not appear to be life-threatening . 
winds were blowing at about 50 mph ( 80 kph ) when the tree , 60-feet ( 18-metre ) tall and 48 inches ( 122 cm ) in diameter , crushed the minivan in the New York City borough of Queens . 
all those killed were sitting in the back two rows of the van , officials said . 
the winds were blowing debris all over streets , toppling garbage cans and breaking branches off trees as the weather service put out a high wind warning . 
national weather Service meteorologists said winds of 30 mph ( 48 kph ) to 40 mph ( 64 kph ) could be expected for much of Thursday , with gusts of more than 60 mph ( 96 kph ) at times . 
they said the winds should start to diminish around sunset . 
Meteorologist Scott Reynolds said the fierce winds were being caused by a low pressure system moving over eastern Massachusetts that was expected to move into the seas off Canada by Friday .
