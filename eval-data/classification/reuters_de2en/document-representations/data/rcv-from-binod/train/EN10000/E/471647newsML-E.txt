the Hungarian economy is heading in the right direction , with growth picking up , but the trade balance is likely to raise concerns over the next few years , HSBC James Capel said in a report dated March 26 . 
HSBC &apos;s London-based emerging market strategist Nigel Rendell said in the report that a two-year period of real wage decline has come to an end in Hungary , interest rates have gone down and multinationals are making large investments . 
these developments will help the gross domestic product ( GDP ) to grow more quickly in 1997 than in 1996 , when GDP growth was maximum 0.5 percent according to estimates . 
&quot; In overall terms , the consensus for growth this year is two to three percent -- we remain at the top end of this range , &quot; Rendell said in the report . 
HSBC expects investments rise by six to seven percent this year . 
this is less than the government forecast of 10 percent , but enough to boost imports , HSBC said . 
increasing economic activity is likely to widen the trade gap , Rendell said . 
&quot; As is the case with other countries in the region , its is the external position that is likely to prompt increasing investor concern over the medium term , &quot; he added . 
Hungary finished last year with a trade deficit of $ 2.65 billion . 
this was marginally higher than a $ 2.44 billion deficit in 1995 , but the rise is somewhat disappointing given that the economy was extremely depressed , Rendell said . 
HSBC expect both exports and imports to grow 15 percent in 1997 , compared with a 10.3 percent rise in exports and a 10.1 percent increase in imports in 1996 . 
this means the trade deficit will rise to $ 3 billion this year , Rendell said , adding that the gap was likely to widen further to $ 3.6 billion in 1998 . 
however , this should not present financing problems to the country as foreign direct investment was likely to remain strong and roughly match the current account deficit , he said . 
the 1.2 percent monthly forint devaluation rate , which will be cut to 1.1 percent on April 1 , is unlikely to be reduced further this year given that the underlying trade position will worsen and the government will be cautious of adjusting policy in the run up to the 1998 election , Rendell added . 
HSBC expects Hungary &apos;s average inflation to go down to 18.5 percent this year from 23.6 percent in 1996 and the year-on-year CPI to drop to levels between 17 and 17.5 percent from 19.8 percent in the last month of 1996 . 
HSBC sees the forint to edge down to around 195 to one dollar by year-end from the current rate of 176.77 , which would imply a marginal depreciation in real terms during the year .
