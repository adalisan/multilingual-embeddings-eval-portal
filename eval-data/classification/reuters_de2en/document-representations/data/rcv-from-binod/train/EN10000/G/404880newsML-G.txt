at least 31 Moslem worshippers , many of them children , were injured on Wednesday in a grenade attack by unidentified guerrillas on a shrine in India &apos;s Kashmir region , police said . 
they said the attackers hurled a grenade onto the crowded lawns of a shrine dedicated to Moslem saint Syed Saimanani in Bahugund village , where hundreds of devotees had gathered for an annual festival . 
&quot; nearly one dozen children were injured in the blast , and five of the injured , including two children , are in critical position , &quot; a police spokesman told Reuters in Srinagar . 
Bahugund is some 60 km ( 35 miles ) south of Srinagar , summer capital of the northern Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir . 
more than a dozen rebel groups are fighting for independence or merger with neighbouring Pakistan in the state , mainly Hindu India &apos;s only Moslem-majority province . 
police and hospitals say more than 20,000 people have been killed since the separatist rebellion broke out in 1990 .
