NYMEX Henry hub natgas futures ended broadly lower Thursday in another active session , with front months hit hardest by a flood of long liquidation after early reports of softer physical prices , sources said . 
June skidded eight cents to close at $ 2.273 per million British thermal units . 
July settled 8.7 cents lower at $ 2.288 . 
most others ended steady to down by 7.4 cents . 
&quot; I think we moved up too far , too fast , and now we &apos;ll see a consolidation into the low-to-mid $ 2.20s. 
I still think we &apos;re going higher down the road , but we don &apos;t have the ( hot ) weather yet to drive it , &quot; said one East Coast trader . 
with Northeast temperatures expected to turn more seasonal next week and no heavy cooling load forecast for the South , some think the upside may be stalled near-term . 
but many expect the bulls to return once hotter weather kicks in , particularly with many still short physical gas this month . 
technical traders said the explosive growth in open interest over the last week to record levels also had many expecting a further profit-taking pullback , but few expected paper or physical prices to crater any time soon . 
they pegged resistance in June at the new high of $ 2.43 and then at $ 2.47-50 . 
support was seen first at $ 2.20 , with major buying likely at $ 2.05 and then along the up trendline around $ 2.04 . 
in the cash , Gulf Coast swing prices were steady to down slightly Thursday at about the $ 2.30 level , with hub gas mostly quoted at $ 2.31-2.34 . 
Midcon pipes also were unchanged to modestly lower in the $ 2.09-14 range . 
new York city gate gas also lost some ground to the $ 2.55-60 area . 
on the KCBT , June finished 3.7 cents lower at $ 2.143 , while deferreds ended down by 2.2 to four cents . 
the East / West spread narrowed by 4.3 cents to 13.0 cents ( NYMEX premium ) . 
KCBT said 674 lots changed hands , up slightly from Wednesday &apos;s total of 656 .
