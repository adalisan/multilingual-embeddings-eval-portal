the U.S. Marine Corps said on Friday it was investigating two bloody and &quot; disgusting &quot; incidents in which medals were pounded into the chests of young paratroopers in a hazing , or initiation , ritual . 
the 1991 and 1993 incidents at Camp Lejeune , North Carolina , caught on videotape obtained and screened by NBC and CNN , showed marines writhing as others pounded the spiked medals onto their chests through thin tee-shirts . 
the ritual , marking completion of preparation for parachute duty , is the second recent controversy to cloud U.S. military training programmes . 
the Army is investigating widespread accusations by female recruits of harassment and rape by male drill instructors . 
&quot; I am outraged that marines would participate in such disgusting behaviour . 
there is absolutely no excuse for this type of behaviour , &quot; the Marine Corps Commandant , Gen. Charles Krulak , said in a statement on Friday . 
he said the corps , which prides itself on its military toughness , had learned of the videotaped incidents earlier this month and prompt action was taken to investigate and end any such practices . 
calling the hazing &quot; shocking and degrading , &quot; corps officials said the five-year time limit had expired for judicial punishment such as jail for trainers involved in the 1991 incident . 
they said courts martial and even penalties of jail were still a possibility in the 1993 incident and any active trainers found to be responsible could be dismissed from the corps in either incident . 
most of the marines on the 1991 videotape have been identified and an initial assessment indicates that nine remain on active duty , the marines said . 
the service was still working on identifying those in the 1993 tape . 
&quot; I am committed to ridding the corps of such heinous behaviour and to ensuring that marines treat each other with dignity , care and concern , &quot; said Krulak , who designated Lt. Gen. Charles Wilhelm , commander of Marine forces in the Atlantic region , to head the investigation . 
corps officials said Wilhelm had authority to bring active marines involved back to Camp Lejeune and to take whatever action was necessary . 
revelations of the hazing incidents come as former world heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe announced he would interrupt his career to join the corps . 
Bowe said on Thursday he had enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve . 
he is due to train at Camp Lejeune .
