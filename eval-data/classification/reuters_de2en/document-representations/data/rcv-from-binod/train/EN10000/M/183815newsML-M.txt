CBOT traders said Tuesday &apos;s supply / demand report issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture was bearish for corn and soybean futures . 
corn was seen opening two to four cents lower on the data , soybeans five to ten cents down with wheat seen one to two cents easier on spillover weakness . 
USDA put U.S. soybean production this year at 2.403 billion bushels , up from the average analysts &apos; projection in a Reuter survey of 2.376 billion . 
&quot; It &apos;s clearly bearish for beans . 
I think it gives us a reason to go back to the lows . 
I feel the corn number is a little bearish , but corn will go lower with the beans , &quot; said Chicago Corp analyst Dave Armstrong . 
corn production was estimated by USDA at 9.265 billion bushels , up from an average analysts &apos; projection of 9.149 billion . 
&quot; Everything is bearish . 
the bean number was up and the corn number was up , &quot; said Ron Kucha of O &apos;Connor and Co . 
Kucha pointed out the soybean crop estimate released by USDA would be the second highest soybean crop on record in the U.S. and the corn crop would be the third highest on record . 
dealers noted USDA cut its estimates for 1996 / 97 wheat ending stocks to 435 million bushels from 470 million but any supportive impact of the revision was likely to be more than offset by spillover weakness from corn and soybean pits .
