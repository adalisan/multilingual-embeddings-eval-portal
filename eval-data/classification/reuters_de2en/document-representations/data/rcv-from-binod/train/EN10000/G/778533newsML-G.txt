Russian crime fighters said on Tuesday the activities of international criminal gangs on their territory threatened the country &apos;s economic security , and urged closer cooperation with police in western Europe . 
&quot; Russia must not become a place where foreign criminals can come and launder their money , &quot; Colonel Valery Zvyagin , deputy chief of Russia &apos;s Interpol bureau , told a news conference . 
Zvyagin said many Russian companies and state organisations were being stung by sophisticated gangs of &quot; moshenniki &quot; , or &quot; swindlers &quot; , who make off with millions of dollars in false loans and credits . 
the colonel said the number of investigations opened on foreign criminals operating in Russia had risen by 80.8 percent in the last year alone . 
the colonel was reluctant to give details of real cases for fear of jeopardising investigations . 
but he cited one example uncovered by Interpol agents in Switzerland and Ecuador , where a fictitious company lured several cash-strapped regional governments into taking credits worth billions of dollars for very low interest . 
the regional authorities found out the credits were worthless bits of paper but only after having made large interest payments to the criminals who quickly vanished . 
Zvyagin said another scam involved circulating false state treasury bills for large sums of hard currency . 
&quot; These rogues just make money out of air , &quot; Zvyagin said . 
Russian crime has grown in sophistication as fast as the country &apos;s under-funded police has declined since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 while struggling to keep up with cross-border crime . 
&quot; Every year , cooperation with our foreign colleagues has increased but we have a lot of budgetary problems and reorganisation is very complicated , &quot; said Colonel Yevgeny Malyshenko , Russian Interpol &apos;s chief analyst . 
the officers were guarded on the countries of origin of foreign criminal gangs they had come across , but Zvyagin said his bureau had uncovered a large Italian crime syndicate in Russia . 
the appearance of 15 new republics following the Soviet collapse has made the task of Russian police tracking criminal funds harder . 
the colonel said the Russian government needed to change outdated Soviet-era laws and sign more agreements with Western countries on extradition and money laundering . 
&quot; Even if we track down a criminal , there &apos;s no guarantee that we can extradite him , &quot; said Zvyagin . 
he said the lack of an extradition treaty with Belgium had prevented a diamond smuggler from being brought to trial . 
Russia &apos;s present-day fears come as the country &apos;s own powerful criminal groups have earned themselves a fearsome reputation in the West . 
but Malyshenko said the picture painted in the West of a powerful Russian mafia was overblown . 
&quot; There &apos;s no such thing as the Russian mafia , &quot; he said , &quot; although we don &apos;t rule out one in the future .
