Mexico &apos;s stock market raced to a record closing high on Tuesday as investors welcomed an ambitious economic plan to spur growth and keep a lid on inflation . 
the IPC index of 37 leading shares closed up 57.24 points , or 1.43 percent , to 4,060.06 points . 
volume was firm at 132 million shares . 
&quot; The market looked good . 
the government economic plan helped . 
it offered continuity in economic policy for the next few years , &quot; said Diego Candano , head of analysis at Ixe brokerage firm . 
President Ernesto Zedillo unveiled the National Programme to Finance Development 1997-2000 , a plan calling for an average of 5 percent economic growth per year to the end of the century and inflation of 7.5 percent by 2000 . 
the plan also allowed for a current account deficit of 3.2 percent of Gross Domestic Product by 2000 . 
analysts said the plan was welcome , but probably too optimistic in its goals , especially its forecast for 5.6 percent GDP growth for 2000 , an election year . 
stocks hit an intraday high of 4,071.86 points , but dealers said sell orders tamed the gains . 
&quot; There was normal profit-taking , especially since interest rates were seen going up ( later in the day ) , &quot; Candano said . 
the central bank auctioned treasury bills on Tuesday , and the bellwhether one month t-bill rate rose sharply -- up 99 basis points to 19.30 percent . 
retailer Cifra was a notable gainer , up 40 centavos ( 5 cents ) to 13.90 pesos ( $ 1.76 ) on news that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. had acquired a controlling interest in the Mexican retailer .
