Thai stocks retreated 1.78 percent on Thursday in response to seasonal tight liquidity and disappointed economic indicators released by the central bank , brokers said . 
the SET index , breaking a three-day rallying streak , closed 14.94 points lower at 826.48 on holiday-thinned 2.8 billion baht turnover . 
&quot; Investors were disappointed by the widened October trade deficit figure released by the central bank today , &quot; said Sanpong Limthamrongkul of Jardine Fleming . 
brokers said investors were also induced to sell by a relatively high October current account deficit which was a touch lower than the September figure . 
the central bank said the October deficit narrowed to 30.2 billion baht from 30.5 billion in September , while trade deficit widened sharply to 36.2 billion baht from 25.0 billion . 
&quot; Local investors sold ahead of the return of foreigners from their holidays . 
they pre-empted foreign selling expected early next month because of the disappointing economic data , &quot; said Sanpong . 
&quot; tight liquidity in the money market , which caused the overnight interbank rate to surge , was another factor for the selling , &quot; Sanpong said . 
the overnight interbank rate rose to 14.50 percent late on Thursday from 13.75-14.00 in the morning . 
all major sectors declined with the finance sector leading the retreat , falling 4.92 percent . 
Krung Thai Bank topped the active list , falling 3.50 baht to 50 , Shinawatra Computer shed 14 to 302 .
