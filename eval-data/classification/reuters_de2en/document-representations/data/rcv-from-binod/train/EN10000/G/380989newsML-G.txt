Trevor Kidd stopped 20 shots on the way to his 10th career shutout and fourth this season as the Calgary flames completed a perfect five-game homestand with a 3-0 defeat of the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday . 
Jonas Hoglund got the flames on the board 6 : 45 into the contest with his 14th goal . 
&quot; They are a wounded bear and they have a great team on paper , &quot; said Kidd . 
&quot; We were worried about them . 
they are having a frustrating year . 
in Chicago , Jeff Hackett recorded his first shutout in exactly a year and Alexei Zhamnov had a goal and an assist as the Chicago Blackhawks blanked the sputtering New York Rangers , 2-0 , for their third straight win and sixth in seven games . 
Bob Probert had the other goal for the Blackhawks , who are unbeaten in their last five games against New York ( 4-0-1 ) . 
the crowd of 22,819 was the largest in team history and the largest in the NHL this season . 
in Hartford , Keith Primeau scored a pair of goals 3 : 20 apart in the second period as the Hartford Whalers snapped a three-game losing streak with a 2-1 win over the Ottawa Senators . 
Sean Burke stopped 26 shots to help Hartford win for just the second time in eight games and extend Ottawa &apos;s winless streak to five games ( 0-3-2 ) . 
in Los Angeles , Jason Arnott &apos;s power-play goal with 1 : 48 left in the third period lifted the Edmonton Oilers into 2-2 tie with the struggling Los Angeles Kings . 
&quot; I think it shows that there &apos;s a lot of character in this dressing room , &quot; Arnott said . 
&quot; It &apos;s different than last year . 
last year we would have folded our tent conming into the third period . 
Fiset made 31 saves for the Kings , who are winless in their last five games . 
in Montreal , John MacLean and Steve Sullivan scored 2 : 42 apart to cap a three-goal first period and the New Jersey devils extended their unbeaten streak to a season-high 10 games by shutting down the Montreal Canadiens , 4-1 . 
Montreal native Martin Brodeur made 25 saves . 
MacLean &apos;s goal with 9 : 12 to go in the opening period broke a 1-1 tie and put New Jersey ahead to stay . 
Brian savage had the lone goal for Montreal . 
at the Islanders , Claude Lapointe , who had not scored a point in nearly two months , slid a backhander through Mark Fitzpatrick &apos;s pads 2 : 46 into overtime and Tommy Salo recorded his third shutout as the New York Islanders edged the Florida panthers , 1-0 . 
in Philadelphia , John Druce and Eric Desjardins scored second-period goals and the Philadelphia flyers , playing without injured star Eric Lindros , limited the NHL &apos;s top offence to a season-low 18 shots in a 5-1 victory over the Pittsburgh penguins . 
Pat Falloon , John LeClair and Daniel Lacroix added insurance tallies in the third period for Philadelphia . 
in Phoenix , Jayson More &apos;s first goal of the season 74 seconds into overtime rescued the Phoenix Coyotes , who blew a three-goal third-period lead but recovered for a 5-4 victory over the Boston Bruins . 
the Coyotes controlled play in the extra session , applying lots of pressure on Bruins goalie Bill Ranford , who was playing for the first time in more than six weeks . 
in St Louis , Mike Ricci scored the go-ahead goal early in the second period and Adam Deadmarsh added the eventual game-winner just over seven minutes later as the Colorado avalanche cruised to a 5-2 victory over the St. Louis blues . 
the game was the first for blues head coach Joel Quenneville against Colorado , where he served as an assistant before resigning to take the post with St. Louis . 
at Tampa Bay , Dino Ciccarelli scored 11 seconds into the game and the Tampa Bay lightning never looked back , earning a 4-1 victory over the Washington Capitals and a split of their home-and-home series . 
Ciccarelli has scored in three straight games after going 11 without a goal . 
in Vancouver , Russ Courtnall and Martin Gelinas each had a goal and an assist in the first period , leading the Vancouver Canucks to their second win in seven games , 4-2 over the mighty ducks of Anaheim . 
Mike Ridley and Jyrki Lumme had the other goals for the Canucks , who have won four of their last five at home .
