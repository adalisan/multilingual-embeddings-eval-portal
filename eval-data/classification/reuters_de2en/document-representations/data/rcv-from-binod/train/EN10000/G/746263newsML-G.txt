more than 100 firefighters battled for several hours to bring a blaze under control on Wednesday at Paris &apos; Musee de l &apos;homme ( Museum of Man ) that traces human history with treasures including statues , frescoes and costumes . 
the blaze , along with several explosions , began in the roof and spread across an area of about 4,000 sq metres ( yards ) in the Palais de Chaillot housing the museum in the Trocadero square overlooking the Seine river towards the Eiffel Tower . 
fire fighters from all over Paris brought the blaze under control shortly before 1 a.m. ( 1100 GMT Tuesday ) , a spokesman said . 
two firefighters were slightly injured . 
the extent of the damage to the art treasures , many from Africa , Asia or the Americas , was not immediately clear . 
culture Minister Catherine Trautmann visited the scene as the fire was raging . 
the Trocadero , choked by thick smoke , was sealed off to traffic . 
&quot; The firefighters are doing a very delicate job because the fire began on the roof , &quot; she said . 
&quot; I hope they will succeed and at least preserve as best as possible what is on the lower floors . 
&quot; France Info public radio said that medieval Mouldings could be seriously damaged by water used to douse the blaze . 
set up in 1938 , the museum offers a synthesis of human history seen through anthropology , archaeology and ethnology . 
the director of the Palais de Chaillor said that the roof had recently been renovated . 
&quot; The frame of the roof window caught fire and that made the glass explode . 
the frame fell on the museum collections ... Mouldings , plasterwork ... the museum has never known such a catastrophe , &quot; he told Europe 1 radio .
