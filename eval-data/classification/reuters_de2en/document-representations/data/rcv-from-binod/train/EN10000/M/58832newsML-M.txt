Irish government bonds pushed upwards in sizeable late trade on Tuesday as the market responded well to U.S. data and an NTMA bond issue in five-year paper which was well oversubscribed , dealers said . 
the National Treasury Management Agency ( NTMA ) set a 100 million punt tap in the five-year bond in late afternoon but due to strong demand sold a total of 212.5 millionpunts which the NTMA said did not satisfy total demand , &quot; dealers said . 
by 1500 GMT the eight percent bond due 2001 was up two pence at 104.82 to yield 6.51 while the eight percent bond due 2006 was rose 30p at 105.40 to yield 7.09 . 
&quot; There have been reasonable volumes of trade in the afternooon . 
despite the extra supply from the NTMA , the market has continued to advance slowly . 
unprecedented demand in the five and 6.5 years is symptomatic of the Irish bond market at the moment , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; The sudden realisation that Ireland can join EMU from day one continues to entice overseas interest , &quot; he added . 
at the Franco German economic summit in Germany , Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said he was hopefull a stability pact could be implemented after currency union at the upcoming European Union meetings in Dublin . 
in the U.S. industrial production data rose by 0.5 percent in August in line with forecasts .
