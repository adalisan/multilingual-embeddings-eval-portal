Central European stocks look attractive after their recent correction , but they are likely to stay flat as money is directed from the secondary to the primary market , Investmentbank Austria said in its June report . 
it said the 1997 price earnings ratios at current prices were at 13 in Poland , 16 in Hungary and 15 in the Czech Republic , but said real earnings growth prospects were stretched . 
&quot; The current valuation suggest a discount of between 20 and 30 percent for Poland and Hungary to its emerging market peers , &quot; the report said . 
but the valuation gap between Western Europe and Central Europe was shrinking , the report added . 
it said Poland was looking attractive but in May and June it was likely to be dominated by big initial public offerings such as Bank Handlowy and copper-pipe producer Hutmen SA . 
but it recommended to use price weaknesses in blue chips such as Agros , Exbud or Elektrim to accumulate positions . 
it said future impetus for Hungary was expected from a possible rebound of the Russian economy , but said in the short term busy a primary market was likely to put pressure on the secondary market . 
it said in the Czech Republic the equity market was likely to be under further downward pressure as corporate restructuring still had a long way to go and first quarter results were disappointing . 
&quot; We recommend taking a cautious stand ( in the Czech Republic ) and concentrating on blue chips , &quot; it said . 
it said Romania &apos;s new listings and planned attractive regulations for direct investments should make the market more attractive in June .
