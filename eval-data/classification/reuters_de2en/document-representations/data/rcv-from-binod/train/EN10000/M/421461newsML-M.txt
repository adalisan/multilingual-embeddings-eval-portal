Indian call money ended Wednesday at 3.0-3.25 percent after trading in a tight range for most of the day , dealers said . 
they said most of the day &apos;s trade was between 2.75 percent and 3.0 percent , with stray deals at 3.50 percent . 
dealers said liquidity with banks remained good but rates could open slightly higher on Thursday due to funds outflows towards a repos auction . 
the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) holds a four-day repos auction of government of India securities later on Wednesday and payments by successful bidders are to be made on Thursday . 
&quot; The outflow towards the auction will have some impact on call money tomorrow , &quot; said a dealer at a state-run bank . 
&quot; But rates should be stable in a 5.0-5.5 percent range . 
dealers said prices of government securities fell in thin trade on Wednesday . 
prices fell on profit-taking by market participants , they said . 
dealers said trade was light as market participants stayed on the sidelines ahead of the repos auction . 
&quot; Market players are waiting to see how much funds go out at the auction , &quot; said a dealer . 
&quot; The post-auction liquidity will determine their investment decisions . 
the 12 percent 1999 government of India stock traded on Wednesday at 100.08 rupees against its last traded 100.18 , the 13.50 percent 1997 at 101.67 against 101.72 and the 13.50 percent 1998 fell to 103.27 from 103.30 , dealers said . 
yields on treasury bills ended mixed , they said . 
March maturity treasury bills yielded 5.0 percent against last yield of 5.5 percent , April bills 7.7 percent against 7.65 and July bills 9.25 percent against 9.15 percent . 
dealers said there were no trades in commercial paper or certificates of deposit .
