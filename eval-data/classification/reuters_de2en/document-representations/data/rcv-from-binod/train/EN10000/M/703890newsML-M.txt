German Bunds and futures started the session well on Wednesday with the September Bund future nipping at the heels of resistance at 102.00 . 
traders said that although prices were helped higher by treasuries late on Tuesday , the rally lacked substance and would therefore subside into range trading in the short term . 
by 0719 GMT , the September DTB Bund contract was trading six basis points higher on the day at 101.96 , having flirted with a high at 101.99 just after the open . 
the DIW said that gross domestic product in Germany would grow just 2.0 percent in both 1997 and 1998 -- well below government forecasts -- while unemployment would climb further to 4.4 million this year and more than 4.6 million next . 
&quot; The strong rally and firm close that occurred on Tuesday certainly reinforce our long-held underlying bullish outlook , but this does not necessarliy mean prices will go shooting up to new highs first thing on Wednesday , &quot; analysts at DMG futures and Options said in a research note . 
the main focus for now will be any interest rate decision from the policy-setting body of the U.S. Federal Reserve . 
but while the inevitable tension surrounds the FOMC meeting , analysts said it was very unlikely that the Fed would move to tighten credit this time around . 
at home the results of the 30-year bond auction would also attract attention , since the market has been slightly nervous of the new long-dated paper as such issues have in the past often coincided with the end of an interest rate easing cycle . 
some analysts said May industry orders and production data , due at around 1100 GMT , might have a negative pull on Bund prices . 
&quot; While orders should see a correction from April &apos;s 3.7 percent month-on-month rise , the underlying picture will remain firm , &quot; said one Frankfurt-based analyst . 
&quot; This should also hold true for production , which we expect to rise by 1.0 percent month-on-month as manufacturers increase inventories , &quot; he added .
