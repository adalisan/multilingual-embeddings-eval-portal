real Madrid could only manage a 1-1 draw at Valladolid on Saturday , but despite the setback will almost certainly spend the New Year &apos;s break on top of the Spanish first division . 
with 39 points from 17 games , Real lead Deportivo Coruna by three points and arch-rivals Barcelona by five . 
Deportivo need to win their game at Sporting Gijon on Sunday by five goals to take over on top . 
real took the lead from a set-piece move by Davor Suker in the 16th minute , but let the game slip away in the second half and Valladolid drew level when defender Rafael Alkorta scored a 58th minute own goal .
