non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) in Morocco , ranging from human rights groups to welfare and youth bodies , called on Thursday for more freedom to act in partnership with the government . 
speaking at a seminar initiated by the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAid ) , they called for the government to show more confidence in them and strengthen the legal framework for their operations . 
USAid director Michael Farbman said : &quot; Our aim is to reach consensus over action to undertake to work more efficiently and to ensure cooperation in each sector . 
the U.S. agency said some 250 groups , including 34 to promote women , 60 for development , and 30 for the environment , were known , although an estimated 17,000 movements were registered with the Interior Ministry . 
population Minister Lamine Benomar told the meeting : &quot; Non-governmental organisations have been elevated to the rank of partners for social and economic action ... our objective is to join efforts to boost economic development , reduce social deficits and promote employment . 
a report released by USAid said : &quot; The Moroccan government has undertaken serious efforts to meet increasing social demands especially when the urban population increased fourfold since 1961 to 12.7 million . 
it said that between 1987 and 1992 , the percentage of public spending allocated to local communities rose to 29.6 percent from 13.8 percent &quot; . 
but the report added : &quot; The inability of the government to continue to ensure the same level of services and provide basis essentials has provoked a feeling of internal frustration , particularly among the young people ... &quot; 
USAid stressed the need for a political dialogue with the government and sponsors to overcome lack of confidence in the action of the NGOs .
