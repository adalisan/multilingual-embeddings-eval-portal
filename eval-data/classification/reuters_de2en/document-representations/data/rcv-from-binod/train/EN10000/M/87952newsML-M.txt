the gains of some heavyweight shares on the Budapest Stock Exchange ( BSE ) propelled the BUX index to a new record high despite a mixed outcome of Tuesday &apos;s trading for Hungarian shares , dealers said . 
the BUX finished at 3,579.10 points , up 7.30 , while spot share turnover dropped to 800 million forints from 1.47 billion forints on Monday . 
traders said as no corporate news has been released recently , it was clear prices were triggered by events abroad . 
&quot; Prices ( of Hungarian shares ) rose in London ( SEAQ ) , while the dollar also firmed , &quot; said New York broker &apos;s Attila Gazdik . 
&quot; There is a tight relationship between prices in London and here , &quot; he said , adding today &apos;s trading was characterised by a strong selling side . 
Borsodchem rose 20 forints to 2,955 . 
however , the drugs company Richter extended its losses and closed at 8,050 forints , down 10 . 
dealers said several players expected Richter &apos;s employee shares to enter the market over the next few days and push down prices and this triggered sellings . 
Gazdik said he expected further price rises with occasional downward corrections over the next two months .
