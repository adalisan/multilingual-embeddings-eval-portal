four people accused of holding dozens of deaf mute Mexicans in servitude were arraigned on Monday on federal charges , while authorities continued to seek the leader of the alleged smuggling ring . 
the ringleaders allegedly forced their victims to live in dire poverty and sell trinkets on the streets and subways of New York City . 
the ring was exposed on Friday when two deaf mutes walked into a police precinct with notes detailing their plight . 
officials rescued 57 people from two cramped city apartments over the weekend . 
they said they were smuggled from Mexico into southern California and transported to Los Angeles and to New York City . 
seven people were arrested , four of whom were arraigned on Monday in federal court in Brooklyn . 
they were charged in a conspiracy to bring , transport and conceal illegal aliens . 
if convicted , they each face a possible prison sentence of 10 years for each illegal alien involved . 
police in the United States and Mexico said they were searching for a Mexican man believed to be the leader of the operation , identified by police as Reinaldo Paoletti . 
four of those arrested were members of the Paoletti family . 
arraigned were Alfredo Rastrian-Paoletti , Rosa Beltran-Sanchez , Santa Gonzalez and Jose Paoletti-Lemus . 
all but Rastrian-Paoletti are deaf . 
Beltran-Sanchez , who is five months pregnant , cried heavily throughout the proceedings , and Bruce McIntyre , attorney for her husband Paoletti-Lemus , said his client was &quot; more victim than victimiser . 
three others were arraigned Sunday on state charges . 
authorities believe the ringleaders recruited their victims from homes and schools for the deaf and mute in Mexico , promising them a better life in the United States . 
the victims said they were forced to work seven days a week as street peddlers , according to court documents . 
they said they were forced to sleep on floors and were abused if they did not make enough money selling key chains , baseballs , pens and toys , the documents said . 
authorities said in one apartment they found $ 35,000 , $ 10,000 of which was in one dollar bills . 
all of the people found in the two apartments were illegal aliens , authorities said . 
of the 57 rescued , 12 were children ranging in age from six months to 16 years . 
the Mexicans were in the custody of city authorities and the American Red Cross was providing them with housing and food until their immigration status was determined .
