French consumer prices fell for the third month in a row in August , in what some economists said underlined the weakness in the economy . 
national statistics institute INSEE said on Friday consumer prices fell between 0.2 and 0.3 percent in August , giving a year-on-year rise of between 1.6 and 1.7 percent . 
&quot; It &apos;s a bigger fall than expected . 
now inflation has fallen three straight months in a row . 
it &apos;s a little worrying , &quot; Jean-Louis Mourier , economist at Louis Dreyfus Finance , said . 
&quot; It &apos;s not a very positive sign for the economy as it highlights sluggish demand . 
we &apos;re not in a deflation environment , but we are in a weak economy , &quot; JP Morgan economist David Naude said . 
the fall in prices was partly due to the fact that a rise last August in Value Added Tax ( sales tax ) was no longer playing a role , although economists said the slowdown was due to more than just this factor . 
&quot; There is a slowdown in underlying inflation , &quot; Banque Nationale de Paris ( BNP ) economist Philippe Cheval said . 
news of the latest fall in inflation however delighted the bond market , which rose on hopes of a new cut in interest rates . 
&quot; It &apos;s weaker than expected . 
it confirms that there is no inflation in France and we now expect further easing on rates , &quot; Nathalie fillet , bond analyst at Banque Paribas , said .
