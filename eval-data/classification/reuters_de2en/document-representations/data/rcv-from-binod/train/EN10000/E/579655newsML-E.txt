Portugal &apos;s inflation slowed sharply to 1.8 percent year-on-year in April , a rate not seen since the 1960s , the National Statistics Institute said on Tuesday . 
the rate compared with 2.5 percent in March . 
the precipitous drop had been widely predicted for statistical reasons because in the same month last year , the consumer price index ( CPI ) was driven higher by rising meat prices provoked by Europe &apos;s mad-cow scare . 
the month-on-month rise in April was 0.2 percent against 0.9 percent in April 1996 when prices rose two percent year-on-year . 
&quot; The rate confirmed the best expectations , &quot; said one bond market trader . 
the April figures took the moving 12-month average , the government &apos;s benchmark rate , to 3.1 percent , down from 3.2 percent in March and 3.4 percent a year ago . 
the government is committed to getting the moving average down to 2.25-2.5 percent by the end of the year as part of its drive to qualify Portugal for the European Union &apos;s single currency .
