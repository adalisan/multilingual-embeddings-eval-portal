Russia &apos;s Emergencies Ministry said on Monday that oil released from a ruptured pipeline near Saratov , south of Moscow , had not reached the Volga river . 
but local officials said they had seen oil on Volga &apos;s ice , and that the size of Sunday &apos;s spill was not known . 
an Emergencies Ministry spokesman said a ministry helicopter had not found any traces of oil in the Volga near the leaking pipeline , about 800 km ( 500 miles ) south of the capital . 
he said special oil traps had been set up on the Metechka creek leading to the Volga . 
some oil had been seen in the creek . 
but he was unable to say how big the spill was . 
Russian state officials have in the past sometimes under-reported damages caused by oil spills and other ecological catastrophes . 
earlier estimates suggested that between 400 and 1,200 tonnes had leaked from the pipeline . 
Itar-Tass news agency quoted local civil defence officials as saying at least 900 tonnes leaked , polluting between 10 and 12 hectares of land . 
they also said that between 300 and 400 tonnes of oil were in the Volga , which runs through much of western Russia to the Caspian Sea . 
they said they had seen a layer of oil covering about 500 square metres of ice on the Volga . 
officials said the Samara-Tikhoretsk pipeline had leaked in a sector which was being repaired . 
the leak was tapped and 40 people were trying to recover the oil , most of which had flooded into a ravine . 
most of Russia &apos;s oil and gas pipelines are ageing and need repairs . 
Ruptures and the resulting ecological damages are common . 
in January last year about 400 tonnes of oil leaked from the Urals-Siberian pipeline which is also near Saratov .
