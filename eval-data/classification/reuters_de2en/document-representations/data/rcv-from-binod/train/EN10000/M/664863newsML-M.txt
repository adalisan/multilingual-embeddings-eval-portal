Hong Kong stocks ended sharply higher on Monday , boosted by red chip euphoria and positive overseas trends , but brokers warned worries about the local property market could produce more volatility ahead . 
&quot; This is a rebound coming on the back of last week &apos;s oversold position , the Dow &apos;s rally and expectation of steady or lower interest rates , &quot; said Peter lui at Nava SC Securities . 
the Hang Seng Index closed 282.05 points or 2.00 percent higher at 14,394.60 , off the day &apos;s high of 14,426.55 , in broad-based activity . 
the Dow Industrials advanced to a new all-time high of 7,799.68 on Friday before ending at 7,782.04 , its sixth consecutive record close . 
recent U.S. economic reports showing subdued inflationary forces have eased market fears of another interest rate hike in July or September , lui said . 
&quot; Hong Kong is in a position for a rally to retest 15,000 soon , &quot; he said . 
but others were not as confident . 
&quot; Until political uncertainty overhanging property stocks lifts , it will be difficult for those shares to bring the index to new highs , &quot; said Chris Geiger , associate director at Vickers Ballas . 
&quot; I think we may find ourselves stuck in a range of 14,000 to 15,000 , &quot; Geiger added . 
the index fell more than 500 points last week on fears that the government would impose measures to curb spiralling property prices , including issuing new guidelines to banks on mortgage lending . 
the utility sector led the market , followed by the commercial and industrial sector . 
the Hang Seng China-affiliated Corporations Index of 32 red chips debuted at 2,732.85 . 
the index , which was backdated to January 4 , 1993 with a base date of 1,000 , gained 194.60 points , or 7.28 percent , to close at 2,867.32 .
