with one bound he was free . 
with the Telstra sell off as an early Christmas present , John Howard can head off to the New South Wales coastal resort of hawks nest for a bit of the old slip , slap , slop , basking in the sun with barely a political cloud in the summer sky . 
how quickly the dynamics of politics change -- in a day , a week , a year . 
twelve months ago Howard was chafing at the bit , trying to keep his ambition in check as Alexander downer stumbled from bad to worse to appalling . 
it was over the summer break ( and at hawks nest ) he dreamed up the Telstra-environment trade-off , a deal designed to kill two electoral birds with one stone . 
it would do something to neutralise Labor &apos;s long-held ascendancy on the environment but handcuff the issue to an opportunity that Howard valued much more -- getting his hands on the proceeds of the long overdue privatisation of Telstra . 
it &apos;s worked . 
just one week ago , it seemed possible the coalition &apos;s first year in office would bear little fruit -- a much watered down industrial relations reform package and an ambitious but significantly hacked-about deficit reduction programme would be all . 
its higher education reforms -- designed to yield A $ 1.7 billion -- were mired in the Senate with every prospect of rejection . 
Peter Costello &apos;s overly aggressive statements about double dissolution elections threatened the chances of its Telstra legislation ever being proclaimed . 
one day ago , the tectonic plates of Senate politics shifted and the tremors will reverberate for a very long time . 
the dynamics of Senate politics may be changed forever . 
it may even become the states house the fathers of federation intended a century ago . 
John Howard and the Independents were the winners . 
the Democrats , Labor and the Greens the clear losers , their leverage clearly diminished , their reputations bruised . 
the prime minister has said proudly more than once he doesn &apos;t do deals -- Brian Harradine was outraged that Cheryl Kernot branded &quot; a bribe &quot; the A $ 350 million of pork he and Mal Colston had just extracted . 
what else was it ? 
Cheryl Kernot has been yelping about porkbarrelling and a shoddy deal . 
but it was the Democrats who wrote the book on Senate horsetrading . 
Budgets have been torn about , the efficiency of tax on wine eroded , wholesale sales taxes turned back . 
they &apos;ve been at it for nearly two decades . 
Kernot says yesterday &apos;s events represent the arrival of blatant American-style porkbarrelling to Australia . 
but what about her behaviour on the workplace Relations Bill ? 
many in small and large business point out that her bowdlerisation of the Reith package will cost the economy dearly -- that it will slow reform of the labour market , slow job creation , slow economic growth . 
how many hundreds of millions of dollars -- even billions of dollars -- will be foregone in the process ? 
Cheryl Kernot may not like it but some proponents of labour market reform might well argue that it was every bit as significant a piece of horse trading as the Harradine-Colston heist . 
greater protections for workers were traded off against higher growth . 
the Democrats now have to rethink their role . 
there may be nearly four times as many of them as the Harradine-Colston axis , but the real power in the Senate lies with the Independents , unless the Democrats are prepared to deal -- as they did over workplace Relations . 
it was a red-letter day for the government , but not for the National Party . 
after all , despite all the angst in the bust about the impact of budget and other cuts , who was it who delivered to regional Australia ? 
not the six Nats in the Senate but two Independents . 
there &apos;s already been private outrage at the highest levels in the parliamentary National Party as they watched Harradine and Colston take the creditt . 
it may hasten the retreat of the National Party into state-based rural rumps -- more a conservative ginger group than a real coalition partner . 
certainly it will make already outspoken mavericks like Bob Katter harder to corral . 
and then there &apos;s Labor . 
for the alternative government , this is the worst of all possible outcomes . 
it &apos;s lost and will have to oppose any further privatisation of Telstra at the next poll -- or face coalition cries of hypocrisy . 
thousands of mums and dads are about to become investors in Telstra , happily reaping the dividends and watching their investments grow in the run up to the election . 
that will help John Howard sleep peacefully over the summer . 
and there &apos;s also the fate of the other two-thirds of Telstra . 
the coalition now has a potential nest egg to offer all manner of bribes at the election . 
sell the rest of Telstra , for instance , to cut personal and corporate taxes , introduce a GST and fund the compensation package . 
how &apos;s that for a start ?
