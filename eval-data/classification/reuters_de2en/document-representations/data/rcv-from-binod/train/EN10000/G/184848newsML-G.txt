the European Commission was split on Wednesday over whether to phase out European Union tobacco subsidies as a way to bolster its anti-smoking message , Commission officials said . 
social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn urged an end to aid for tobacco production , saying it contradicted the EU &apos;s efforts to cut down on smoking-related deaths . 
but Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler argued that ending the subsidies would put 135,000 EU tobacco growers out of work without curbing smoking since consumers would simply buy imported products , officials said . 
the question is sensitive since eight EU countries produce tobacco , led by Italy and Greece . 
Fischler prefers to target the subsidies at higher-quality tobacco and to help farmers diversify their crops where possible , officials said . 
diversification is a limited option , however , since many tobacco growers work on small patches of land that is not suitable for anything else , they said . 
&quot; The solution is not simple , &quot; Commission spokesman Klaus van der Pas told a news briefing . 
Flynn prepared a paper for the debate complaining that the EU paid almost 993 million Ecus to support tobacco production in 1995 , while devoting only 15 million Ecus annually to discourage smoking . 
he conceded that the EU would have to provide &quot; large-scale &quot; financial assistance to help the tobacco sector adjust if it abolished subsidies . 
both Fischler and Flynn are drafting papers on tobacco that are expected to be adopted by the Commission in the next few weeks -- Fischler &apos;s on the future of the EU &apos;s tobacco farming regime and Flynn &apos;s on new measures the EU could take to discourage smoking . 
Fischler won support during Wednesday &apos;s debate from commissioners including Greece &apos;s Christos Papoutsis , Italy &apos;s Emma Bonino and France &apos;s Yves-Thibault de Silguy , one official said . 
Belgium &apos;s Karel Van Miert and Denmark &apos;s Ritt Bjerregaard were more sympathetic to Flynn , he added . 
Flynn told a news conference on Tuesday he planned to submit proposals on tobacco consumption later this month that will be based heavily on recommendations made by an EU group of cancer experts . 
they recommended lowering the nicotine content of cigarettes , banning additives other than tobacco unless they are proven to be non-toxic and strengthening health warnings on tobacco product .
