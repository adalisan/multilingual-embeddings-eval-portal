a medium-term resistance level at 1,640 points will only be breached if turnover grows further , Omega Securities said in a technical analysis report . 
&quot; Whereas short-term indicators suggest there is room for a rise of the general index to its medium-term resistance at 1,640 points , medium-term indicators suggest it is unlikely to see it climb further at current volume levels , &quot; it said . 
current trading volume levels will sustain the medium term consolidation of prices with the general index fluctuating between 1,530 and 1,615 points , it added . 
the market &apos;s sharp rise which was coupled with a slight pick up in turnover last Thursday and Friday ruled out a downturn below a medium-term support level of 1,530 points . 
&quot; The index has already penetrated upwards its 30-day moving average amidst rising turnover in the last two sessions , &quot; Omega said . 
&quot; There appears little chance of a drop below 1,530 points which is a strong medium-term support level .
