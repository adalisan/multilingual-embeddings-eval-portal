U.S. shares were mixed to lower in Europe on Friday , unsettled by a weak high-technology sector . 
High-techs were weighed down by Hewlett-Packard Co which dropped $ 5 to $ 53-7 / 8 after the company , citing sluggish order and revenue growth , reported an 8 percent rise in second-quarter net earnings . 
net earnings of $ 0.75 per share , released after the Dow &apos;s close on Thursday , compared with a First Call analysts estimate of $ 0.80 per share . 
&quot; It &apos;s been all high-techs this morning . 
the whole sector has taken a hit after the Hewlett figures , &quot; one market maker said . 
Hewlett shares had risen $ 2-1 / 4 to $ 58-7 / 8 ahead of Wall Street &apos;s close in anticipation of an upbeat result . 
elsewhere in the sector , Intel Corp , which jumped $ 5-3 / 8 on Thursday , lost $ 1 / 2 to $ 158-5 / 8 while Digital Equipment Corp eased $ 1 / 4 to $ 32-3 / 4 . 
dealers said high-techs were also spooked by a bearish earnings statement from Netscape Communications . 
the Internet access software maker on Thursday said higher spending for research and development as well as sales and marketing and customer support levels , would prevent the company from sustaining historical growth rates .
