the Toronto Stock Exchange soared and posted its 53rd record close of 1996 on Wednesday , driven by excitement in interest-sensitive issues and conglomerates . 
the key TSE 300 composite Index rocketed 85.45 points to close at 5749.92 points on 118.1 million shares . 
Toronto reached its highest value traded in one day in 1986 , the exchange said . 
Toronto is &quot; a market that &apos;s generally under-owned in North America , &quot; said chief investment strategist Michael Metz of Oppenheimer &amp; Co , Inc . 
Canadian bank stocks have benefitted from foreign interest , especially after U.S. brokerage Morgan Stanley upgraded Toronto-Dominion Bank and Royal Bank of Canada this week . 
&quot; The multiple revision that has taken place is not pushing the ( banking ) group into untenable territory , rather it is a valuation range that the Canadian banks deserve , relative to their peers in the U.S. , &quot; Best said . 
in today &apos;s action , all of Toronto &apos;s 14 sub-indices surged higher except for gold issues , which fell on slipping bullion prices . 
the conglomerate group gained the most , adding more than five percent . 
it was followed by consumer products , banks and transports . 
banks and interest-sensitive issues were among today &apos;s most heavily traded stocks .
