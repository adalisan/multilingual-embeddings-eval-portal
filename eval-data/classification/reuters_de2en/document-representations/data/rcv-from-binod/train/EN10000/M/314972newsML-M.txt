NYMEX prompt crude resisted major declines seen in the back months Friday as traders covered short positions amid supply disruptions when inventories are already tight , traders said . 
at 1503 est , February crude was off a mere two cents a barrel at $ 25.50 . 
March crude was off 30 cents at $ 24.52 . 
the Feb / March spread widened to more than $ 1.00 earlier from 70 cents on Thursday . 
&quot; We had Pemex close ports taking almost 800,000 barrels out of the market when supplies are aready low , &quot; said a trader . 
Thursday night , a cold front in Mexico shut the crude shipping ports of Pajaritos in Veracruz and Dos Bocas in Tabasco , port officials said . 
Pajaritos ships 400,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) on average and Dos Bocas exports 300,000 bpd on average . 
meanwhile , the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) said for the week ended January 10 , U.S. crude stocks were 14 million barrels below a year ago . 
the ports reopened Friday afternoon . 
&quot; There are several big players who are short that just don &apos;t have the crude for delivery , so they have to cover now , &quot; said a trader . 
dealers said the short covering in February amid tight supply was prompted by the contract &apos;s expiry Tuesday .
