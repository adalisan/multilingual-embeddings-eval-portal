the Japanese government released data on Thursday that pointed up for the economy , but whether the markets pay heed remains to be seen , analysts and officials said . 
but the current economic conditions are fairly strong and I hope that the markets would take note of this , &quot; said Economic Planning Agency ( EPA ) Vice Minister Shimpei Nukaya . 
the markets have been ignoring government pronouncements about the health of the economy because they feel its assessment has been overly rosy and tended to support the ending of economic-boosting measures such as more public works spending and special income tax cuts , analysts said . 
the dollar surged above 115 yen for the first time in 44 months on Thursday , while Tokyo stocks plunged below 19,000 at one point , their lowest level in more than a year . 
after the stock and bond markets closed on Thursday , the government released data that showed industrial output was expected to rise at a faster pace in the months ahead . 
manufacturers forecast a hefty 5.1 percent rise in output in January after an expected 0.8 percent increase in December . 
&quot; We are almost certain that Japan &apos;s industrial production will remain firm at least until the end of March . 
but it is difficult to predict how the consumption tax rise will affect industrial output , &quot; a senior Trade Ministry official said . 
&quot; We have to be cautious about production after April , &quot; she added . 
economists say the recovery is supported by rising exports , especially of cars to the United States , and buying by consumers ahead of the planned consumption tax hike . 
private and government economists share the view that economic growth will slow in the first half of 1997 / 98 as a planned increase in the consumption tax to five percent from three percent on April 1 , the start of the fiscal year , would dampen consumption . 
last week , the government announced that it expects Japan &apos;s gross domestic product ( GDP ) to grow around 1.9 percent in 1997 / 98 -- the lowest official forecast in four decades . 
private economists &apos; forecasts range from growth of about one percent to three percent . 
other data released on Thursday showed a healthy economy . 
Japan &apos;s vehicle exports rose 14.1 percent in November from a year earlier to 329,868 vehicles , the Japan Automobile Manufacturers &apos; Association said . 
it was the sixth successive month of year-on-year gains . 
meanwhile , housing starts , a key barometer for private consumption , rose 9.9 percent from a year earlier in November . 
but the markets have been resistant to more data showing a gradual recovery . 
the key Nikkei stock average plunged nearly 700 points in the afternoon on Thursday before recovering to end down 257.83 points or 1.32 percent at 19,291.58 . 
meanwhile , the dollar has shed some of its hefty morning gains by late afternoon Tokyo , standing at around 114.70 yen . 
the losses highlight the lack of confidence in the Japanese economy as well as in the government policies designed to help the fragile recovery , brokers said . 
&quot; gloom spread due to Japan &apos;s budget ( draft ) for fiscal 1997 , which calls for a consumption tax hike and an end to special income tax cuts , &quot; said Tadahiro Kamogawa , Yamaichi Securities general manager .
