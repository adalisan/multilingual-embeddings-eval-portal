Ho Chi Minh City &apos;s customs office said on Saturday that 6.3 tonnes of marijuana were seized at Vietnam &apos;s Saigon Port last week . 
a customs official said the marijuana , which had been shipped from Cambodia via Singapore , came to light when a local transport and distribution firm under which it had been registered refused to take delivery of a container . 
the official declined to give a street value for the haul , one of the customs office &apos;s biggest ever .
