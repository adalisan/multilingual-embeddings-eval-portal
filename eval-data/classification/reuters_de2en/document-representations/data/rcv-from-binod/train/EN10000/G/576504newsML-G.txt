a Maltese court on Monday rejected Libya &apos;s request for the extradition of a Libyan whom Tripoli has accused of drug trafficking . 
Maltese magistrate Noel Cuschieri said Libya had failed to prove its allegations that Najib al-Hashemi al-Harari , 27 , was wanted for drug trafficking . 
Harari told the court that he was not involved in drug traffic . 
he said he was a member of a group opposing the government of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . 
strict security was mounted round the Valletta Courthouse following telephone threats to the prison authorities that Harari would be killed . 
Harari has served a seven-month jail term in Malta for entering the country using a false passport . 
but he was re-arrested just over a week ago as he was about to leave Malta for Sweden following the extradition request by Libya . 
the human rights group Amnesty International had led several groups in urging Malta not to extradite Harari , saying he was wanted for his Islamist opposition activities . 
Harari , recognised as a refugee by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , has been granted asylum in Sweden .
