a leading Zimbabwean democracy campaigner charged on Monday he lost a weekend race for Harare &apos;s mayoral election through rigging . 
his rival and polling officials were unavailable to comment . 
university of Zimbabwe lecturer law lecturer Kempton Makamure said he would ask the courts to nullify the poll in which Solomon Tawengwa of President Robert Mugabe &apos;s ruling ZANU-PF party won with 14,446 votes to his 4,182 votes . 
Makamure alleged ballot boxes were opened in his absence before counting and may have been stuffed with false votes . 
&quot; I have no alternative except to apply to the courts to nullify this electoral facade and order a fresh election conducted on normal democratic lines , &quot; he said . 
many political analysts had predicted a close race between Tawengwa , a prominent Harare businessman , and Makamure , an outspoken government critic .
