Hungarian Industry Minister Szabolcs Fazakas criticised Slovakia on Wednesday for introducing a seven percent import surcharge this week . 
&quot; The Slovak measure contradicts the spirit of CEFTA ( Central European Free Trade Agreement ) , &quot; Fazakas told the daily newspaper Nepszabadsag , adding he hoped the matter could be dissolved before the CEFTA &apos;s September summit . 
Slovakia , facing serious foreign trade problems , imposed a 7.0 percent import surcharge on all goods except raw materials , effective July 21 . 
Fazakas said the seven percent surcharge affected 80 percent of Hungary &apos;s imports into the neighbouring country , while the earlier Slovak import deposits took away two percent from the price of 40 to 50 percent of Hungary &apos;s exports . 
Slovakia canceled its first import surcharge , imposed in 1994 , in January this year after fierce criticism from the European Union and the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) . 
Fazakas said the WTO would examine if the reintroduction of the surcharge was justified . 
&quot; Perhaps the European Union -- with which Slovakia has a trade deficit -- will accept Slovakia &apos;s arguments , but we will have to find a bilateral way out of this situtation , &quot; he added . 
according to the ministry &apos;s earlier figures , Hungary &apos;s exports to Slovakia in the first five months of this year totalled $ 108 million , while imports from Slovakia amounted to $ 152 million .
