the pound stumbled on Thursday after restrained Bank of England comments weakened the rate rise expectations which had coaxed investors into their heaviest sterling-overweight positions in years . 
Bank of England governor Eddie George said a rate increase was needed , but there was no &quot; urgent need for a dramatic step &quot; . 
his words boosted interest rate futures as dealers downgraded their rate expectations , and knocked the pound to session lows of 2.5165 marks and $ 1.6103 -- a far cry from recent four-year peaks of 2.6370 and $ 1.6905 . 
&quot; It was just becoming the case that interest rate expectations as priced into the market were losing touch with reality , &quot; said Adam Cole , UK economist at HSBC James Capel here . 
on Tuesday , sterling saw a sharp correction from its four-year high against the mark , and had already been extending those losses on Thursday before George &apos;s testimony to the parliamentary Treasury committee . 
but the comments accelerated that process as they cast doubt on one of the key factors behind the pound &apos;s recent dazzling rally -- the prospect of near-term monetary tightening . 
&quot; They &apos;ve been prodding the sterling bear with a stick and it &apos;s finally woken up and taken their arm off , &quot; said one trader , referring to the holders of long sterling postions . 
a recent survey by U.S. investment house Merrill Lynch showed international fund managers amassed their highest portfolio weightings of sterling in almost eight years during the three months to November . 
the temptation for traders to book profits on these positions before their end-year bonuses are set unleashed a wave of sterling sales for dollars on Tuesday . 
the pound soared but then lost nearly five cents and nine pfennigs on the day . 
Tuesday &apos;s high of 2.6370 marks -- sterling &apos;s best level since leaving Europe &apos;s exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 -- represented a rise of almost 16 percent since August . 
but in the past 72 hours it has shed as much as 12 pfennigs or 4.5 percent of its value since scaling that peak . 
the pound was also unsettled by George &apos;s remark that he did not believe Britain was on the verge of a 1980s-style consumer boom , analysts said . 
economic data out of the UK has consistently pointed to a buoyant consumer sector . 
&quot; He does seem to be playing down the inflation risk a little bit , &quot; said Marian Bell , treasury economist at Royal Bank of Scotland in London . 
sterling futures , which had been pricing in rates of 6.70 percent by the end of the first quarter of 1997 , jumped on George &apos;s comments to price in rates of 6.54 percent . 
British base rates were raised by 25 basis points to 6.0 percent on October 30 . 
the pound bounced smartly from the $ 1.6100 zone and recovered to trade at $ 1.6218 and 2.5305 marks by 1249 GMT . 
but dealers said this week &apos;s volatile moves had sent a timely warning to a market which had got ahead of itself . 
&quot; This is a good lesson for those who think you can &apos;t go wrong with a high yielder , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; This is exactly why sterling yields well over six percent .
