the following is a selection of analysts &apos; reactions to Japan &apos;s customs-cleared trade data for December released on Thursday , which showed a year-on-year fall of 20.6 percent to 881.48 billion yen . 
asked if the figures would affect the dollar / yen , he said : &quot; I don &apos;t think so . 
some speculators had expected to see the figures a little bit on the negative side for Japan and they might see some oral intervention by the Japanese monetary authorities ... but I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to happen only because of these figures . 
Kinoshita said that the U.S. side sees no problem at all in maintaining a strong dollar . 
U.S. president Bill Clinton &apos;s administration is not going to care very much about the trade surplus with Japan , either , which is starting to rise again , especially in car exports , he said . 
he said as long as the Group of Seven ( G7 ) industrialised nations are willing to cooperate with each other to get results , the dollar / yen should be capped around 120 yen and the monetary authorities will be getting ready to do something , in either words or deeds , though the timing cannot be predicted . 
asked whether the declining trend in the trade surplus will continue , Shimamoto said : &quot; Yes , for a while . 
however , already there is a change in the trend , because the size of the trade surplus with the U.S. is picking up , especially stronger automobile exports with the U.S. That is really the key kind of signal , showing a change in the trend , because the weaker yen will really accelerate the automobile exports to the U.S. 
&quot; You have to look at the trade balance between Japan and the U.S. rather than the overall figures . 
asked about the outlook for calendar 1997 , Shimamoto said : &quot; I think the overall trade figure will continue to increase rather than decline because the weaker Japanese yen would really help to boost exports , especially automobiles . 
again , the autmobile industry is really suffering from fierce competition , so in order to gain profits , exports are the only way to get it . 
Japan &apos;s trade surplus fell sharply in December from a year earlier due to subdued growth in exports and the continued high tempo of imports . 
but growth in the volume of Japanese imports fell for two consecutive months and this showed that the yen &apos;s fall against the dollar has been affecting Japan &apos;s trade picture . 
&quot; The weak yen has kept and will keep Japan &apos;s trade surplus from falling sharply . 
it is likely that a declining tempo in Japan &apos;s trade surplus may slow down in the near future . 
it is even possible that the surplus will start to increase .
