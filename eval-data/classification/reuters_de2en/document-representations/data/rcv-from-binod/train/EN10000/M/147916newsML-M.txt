Dutch shares ended showing only light gains on Monday as the neutral mood persisted with many investors sidelined ahead of an impending batch of corporate results due this week and next , dealers said . 
&quot; There &apos;s not much to trade on . 
everyone is waiting for the results to come out before coming back in , &quot; one dealer said . 
the AEX index of blue chip stocks traded in a very narrow range all day , moving between 588.77 and 591.62 points before closing up 0.97 points at 591.15 , a rise of just 0.16 percent . 
a firm start to Wall Street gave the market a late boost but dealers noted it was on the back of very modest turnover . 
Philips topped the very low volume list , easing back on mild profit-taking after Friday &apos;s surge , viewed as a little overdone . 
the electronics giant finished 0.90 guilders off at 61.30 . 
Royal Dutch had another good day , ending up 3.70 at 291.30 but dealers said most of the gains were scored late in the session as U.S. buyers for the stock emerged . 
the oil company reports its third quarter earnings on Thursday this week . 
chemicals group DSM is due to report its results on Tuesday when analysts expect a 15 percent drop on last year &apos;s figure to between 181 to 212 million guilders . 
the shares reflected continued jitters , ending off 0.50 at 166.60 guilders . 
elsewhere , there was little activity . 
some dealers said the market was looking increasingly expensive at these levels and predicted an iminnent correction . 
but others , citing very strong chart support at 580 points , said an advance could take the AEX as high as 610 . 
brokerage Wesselius advocated a strategy of buying November calls with strikes at 590 which were trading around 5.50 guilders to take advantage of such a scenario .
