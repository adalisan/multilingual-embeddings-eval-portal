cautious about the short term prospects for the AEX share index ,

volatile but we do expect support at 700 to hold up . 
although 
the AEX could easily be at the higher end of the broad trading 
range by the end of the week , we prefer to stay neutral for the 
time being . 
however , a break of support at 700 would immediately 
trigger a sell signal and open the way to the 670 level . 
there 
has been another sharp correction within a longer term uptrend . 
again , support has been found slightly above 700 . 
we expect 
positive momentum to pick up again and foresee a renewed attack 
on the 750 level . 
we continue to prefer an aggressive approach 
in this market and advise reopening long positions . 
this move up 
can take place in a very short time frame . 
the market is heavily 
oversold and waiting to bounce up again .
