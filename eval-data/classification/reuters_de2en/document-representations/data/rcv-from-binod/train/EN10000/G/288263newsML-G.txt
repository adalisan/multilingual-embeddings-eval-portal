Angolan opposition leader Jonas Savimbi arrived in the South African town of Umtata on Monday for talks with President Nelson Mandela who is holidaying nearby , national television said . 
&quot; The formation of an Angolan government of national unity will be high on the agenda , &quot; it said ahead of the talks , delayed until the evening because of transport problems . 
Savimbi , head of the former UNITA rebel group , and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos are trying to put the new government together under a 1994 peace plan that ended two decades of civil war . 
progress has been slow . 
the two rivals agreed last month to form a government of national reconciliation on January 23 in a landmark move on the country &apos;s path to peace . 
Savimbi will meet Mandela in an official capacity for the first time since South Africa &apos;s historic all-race polls in 1994 .
