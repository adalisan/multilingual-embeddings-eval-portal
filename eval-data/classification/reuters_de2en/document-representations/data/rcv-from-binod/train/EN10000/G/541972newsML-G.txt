he calls himself the little guy from Shawinigan , but that belies the shrewd cunning with which millionaire Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has fought his political battles . 
Chretien called a federal election on Sunday , 17 months before he had to , a cold calculation that he should try to capitalise on a solid Liberal lead in the polls now rather than risk seeing the opposition keep chipping away point by point . 
in the process he has run up against criticism that he is an intellectual lightweight , one with little vision for a second term in office especially in an age when governments find it tough to fund the grand schemes he used to champion . 
&quot; What excuse does he use going to the electorate ? 
you know , complete the following sentence , &apos; I &apos;m going to go to the people because ... &apos; what ? 
because what ? 
he has no vision of where he &apos;s heading , &quot; opposition Reform Member of Parliament Chuck Strahl said last week as election plans were drawn up . 
in announcing his election call , Chretien made it clear he would run on his record of getting the fiscal house in order , while declaring that government and its programmes were good and not detrimental . 
&quot; Our choice is to see the job through , to secure our future together , to finish the work of balancing the budget that we started , to secure programmes Canadians need and want , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Liberals believe that government can , should and must be a force for good . 
Chretien , 63 , a Quebecker who mangles both English and his native French , has managed to cultivate an image of his aw-shucks humble background in the same way Ronald Reagan did as president of the United States . 
he refers often to how he came to Parliament in 1963 as 29-year-old small-town lawyer who spoke little English , the 18th of 19 children born to a Roman Catholic family in a paper-mill town in central Quebec . 
Chretien is deaf in one ear and has a twisted mouth because of a birth defect -- which his Conservative opponents satirised in the 1993 election campaign but which he unerringly turned around to make political hay . 
like Reagan , he is affable , often stumbling , a Teflon man to which few of his government &apos;s problems seemed to stick . 
and like Reagan , he prefers to give his ministers great autonomy , even if it means he is often ignorant of day-to-day details . 
this style , together with his championing of Canadian unity , has made him among the most popular prime ministers in English-speaking Canada though ironically he is reviled in much of Quebec , especially among separatists . 
Canadians think his government has generally done a good job in conquering chronic deficits though on social issues like gun control , crime and homosexual rights they are more divided . 
he has also taken flak for spending cuts . 
but he has proved most vulnerable on the issue of Quebec . 
Chretien had told Canadians not to worry during an October 1995 campaign on a referendum on Quebec separation -- and then came within one percentage point of losing the province . 
separatists like to say he betrayed Quebec in constitutional wranglings in 1982 , while others say he has followed his predecessors in pandering to Quebec demands . 
looming over his shoulder in this campaign will be his separatist nemesis , Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard , a charismatic leader who set the referendum drive on fire -- yet one whom he will never actually face on the election trail . 
the toughest battle of his life may be the battle for his own seat . 
he is facing former provincial minister Yves Duhaime , a separatist who says he leads Chretien in the polls . 
but he loves a fight and is confident of victory . 
before becoming prime minister in 1993 , Chretien had held nine cabinet posts under three different prime ministers -- Lester Pearson , Pierre Trudeau and John Turner . 
in 1986 , unused to sitting on the opposition benches , he quit politics and returned to practising law , cultivating relationships among the powerful in Montreal and Toronto . 
he returned as Liberal leader in 1990 and led his party to triumph with 177 of 295 seats in the House of Commons . 
Chretien is married and has two sons and a daughter .
