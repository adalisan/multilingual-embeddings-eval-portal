industrial Relations Minister , Peter Reith , says the New South Wales government seems powerless or unprepared to take on the unions in the lead up to the 2000 Olympics . 
Mr Reith says wage rises sought by building unions are inflationary and will cost jobs . 
he says the state Government is letting the unions hold taxpayers to ransom over Olympic construction projects . 
but the Construction Union says major construction companies are accepting union wage claims in enterprise negotiations . 
new South Wales Opposition spokesman on the Olympics , Ian Armstrong , says Michael Knight &apos;s involvement in filling vacancies in the Olympic Organisation opens the opportunity for cronyism . 
Mr Knight , who chairs the Olympics Organising Committee and is Olympics Minister , has taken responsibility for filling up to eight vacant senior executive positions . 
Mr Armstrong says this could allow Mr Knight to put some of his political mates in the jobs . 
he also says having the chairman doing the day-to-day mechanics puts a whole new management strata in place . 
Mr Knight says the vacancies were always going to be advertised at the end of the year . 
small business is downbeat about the state of the Australian economy but says things are looking up for next year . 
in the latest quarterly survey conducted for the Yellow Pages , 62 percent of of the 1200 small businesses questioned thought the economy had stalled . 
eighteen per cent considered it to be in recession . 
but 46-per cent anticipated improved conditions in 12 months with only 11-per cent expecting things to get worse . 
treasurer Peter Costello said the Government &apos;s Budget forecast would be met , when Monday &apos;s business investment figures were stronger than expected . 
but Economic advisor to the Yellow Pages survey , John Marsden , says today &apos;s survey results show the bulk of investment is confined to mining , telecommunications and infrastructure . 
Australian retailers and the Textile , Clothing and Footwear Union are at loggerheads over the union &apos;s campaign to reduce the exploitation of outworkers in the clothing industry . 
the union &apos;s angry because the Australian Retailers &apos; Association has refused to provide it with a list of clothing manufacturers , and the retailers they supply . 
the Ara says it is prepared to give the union a list of manufacturers , but the union says it can just as easily get such information from the Yellow Pages . 
the association says meeting the union &apos;s demands would affect retailers &apos; commercial confidentiality . 
a peanut grower in Queensland &apos;s South Burnett says consumers will benefit from more stringent health standards now in place after a salmonella outbreak in peanut butter earlier this year . 
the outbreak was traced to the peanut Company of Australia &apos;s Kingaroy plant , causing some products to be withdrawn . 
but there is some concern among growers about a drop-off in demand , as products withdrawn due to the outbreak are about to be returned to the shelves . 
grower , Peter McIntosh , says hygiene has been upgraded at all plants , and the health department is watching the industry closely . 
Mr McIntosh says he &apos;s certain the peanut butter which goes back on sale shortly will be a top grade product . 
the media union says tomorrow &apos;s telecast of the Greg Norman Golf classic is likely to be disrupted by a strike at Channel Seven . 
staff at the network have voted to strike indefinately over the targeting of nearly 120 jobs around the country and management &apos;s withdrawal of an improved redundancy offer . 
the strike affects Melbourne , Sydney , Brisbane and Adelaide , with Perth staff meeting this afternoon . 
Dave Lane of the Media , entertainment and Arts Alliance says there &apos;ll be severe disruption to news and current affairs programs tonight , at the very least . 
the dispute is due to go before the Industrial Relations Commission in Sydney this afternoon . 
there &apos;s a warning that business people at Coffs Harbour will close up and walk away if they &apos;re denied insurance payouts for damage from last weekend &apos;s storms . 
it comes from Coffs Harbour MP , Andrew Fraser , who says insurance companies seem to be considering rejecting a number of claims on the basis damage was caused by flooding rather than by rain water . 
Mr Fraser says stormwater drains backed up because of high tides and it &apos;s most unreasonable of insurance companies to try to avoid paying compensation . 
he says they also have an obligation to householders because some have been left with only a soggy bed and lounge suite , everything else having floated into the Pacific Ocean . 
new South Wales Ports Minister Carl Scully has announced a 100-million dollar expansion program at Port botany which he says will provide a big boost to trade capacity and productivity at the port . 
Patrick stevedores will invest 100-million dollars to increase its terminal space at Port botany and have its lease extended for a further ten years from 2008 by the Sydney Ports Authority . 
the agreement includes productivity provisions requiring Patrick stevedores to pursue operating standards comparable to similar international facilities . 
foreign Minister , Alexander downer says a record number of visa applications this month by Malaysians wanting to visit Australia shows the relationship with Malaysia is in very good shape . 
Malaysia &apos;s Prime Minister Mahatir Mohammed says just because the race issue wasn &apos;t raised directly in his recent talks with Prime Minister John Howard , doesn &apos;t mean he isn &apos;t thinking about it . 
Critisim in Australia of Asian migrants and multiculturalism has sparked concern in Asia . 
but Mr downer says this month has seen the highest number of Australian visa applications by Malaysian tourists and students in Australia &apos;s history . 
golf ... and Greg Norman says his upcoming three-month break is a sabbatical for his mind as well as his back . 
as he prepares for tomorrow &apos;s Greg Norman classic at Royal Melbourne , the world number one says probably 95 per cent of golfers have back problems . 
Norman says the unnatural swing of golf is bound to catch up with you if you do it a lot . 
but he says he &apos;s feeling fine for tomorrow &apos;s tournament .
