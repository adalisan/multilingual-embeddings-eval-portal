Bulgaria &apos;s ex-communist ruling party caved in to opposition pressure on Tuesday after 30 days of mass protests , agreeing to general elections by April 20 . 
tens of thousands of anti-government demonstrators poured into the streets of Sofia , dancing , singing and chanting &quot; Victory &quot; . 
President Petar Stoyanov came out of the presidency to accept the cheers of crowds chanting his name and warn them through a loudhailer that hard times were still ahead . 
jubilant demonstrators lifted him onto their shoulders and carried him through the streets . 
protesters dismantled roadblocks and cars flying opposition flags drove through the streets honking their horns . 
crowds gathered at the presidency and outside the Alexander Nevsky cathedral , the site of daily opposition rallies . 
a joint statement issued after a meeting of political leaders said each of the parties in parliament had agreed to give up its mandate to form a government , and the president would schedule elections in the second 10 days of April . 
under the constitution , Stoyanov must appoint a caretaker cabinet whose main role will be to organise the polls . 
&quot; Bulgaria is faced with extremely severe economic challenges , &quot; Stoyanov told reporters . 
it won &apos;t be plain sailing , there will be extreme difficulties on the road . 
inflation was estimated at 50 percent in January , the biggest oil refinery is running out of crude because it cannot pay its bills , and people queued for bread in the capital on Tuesday . 
the Socialists , elected to a four-year term in December 1994 , have been blamed for the severe economic crisis . 
outgoing prime minister Zhan Videnov resigned on December 21 but the party had insisted on forming a new cabinet . 
&quot; I do not promise you that you will be richer or you will live better , I promise you that under the next government I will be honest and you will be master of your lives , &quot; Stoyanov ( corrects from &quot; opposition leader Ivan Kostov &quot; ) told the crowd . 
his Union of Democratic Forces ( UDF ) opposition party must first win the April election but UDF candidate Stoyanov scored a crushing presidential win last November . 
the UDF stepped up strikes a week ago , when the Socialists said they would form a new cabinet . 
protesters in the town of Doupnitsa have kept up a round-the-clock blockade of main road and rail routes to Greece since last Wednesday . 
the festive street theatre of Sofia &apos;s student protesters has won the hearts of many people in the capital , though several students have been hurt in scuffles with motorists trying to break through roadblocks . 
Kostov told the chanting throng : &quot; I would like to thank our president , who managed to take control of this difficult situation and all the people in the streets , and all those who went on strike to support us . 
and especially the students because without their enthusiasm we wouldn &apos;t have gone so far . 
he invited supporters to one last celebratory victory rally on Wednesday evening at the Alexander Nevsky cathedral . 
Bulgarian Socialist Party ( BSP ) leader Georgi Parvanov said the agreement showed the party &apos;s political maturity . 
&quot; This was a step towards restoration of confidence in the BSP and its effect will be felt in the upcoming elections , &quot; he told reporters . 
the political crisis has accelerated the collapse of the national currency , which closed at 2,800-3,000 levs to the dollar on Tuesday from 1,000 a week ago . 
Bulgaria still has no state budget for 1997 and it was not clear whether international lenders would be prepared to negotiate urgently needed accords with a caretaker government in office for little more than two months .
