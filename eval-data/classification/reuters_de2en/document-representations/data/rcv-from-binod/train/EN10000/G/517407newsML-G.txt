the U.S. Senate on Thursday scheduled a debate next week on a global treaty outlawing chemical weapons , finally prying the pact from the grip of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms . 
under a schedule agreed to unanimously following torturous negotiations with the North Carolina Republican , the Senate will debate the treaty for up to 18 hours starting at 10 a.m. ( 1400 GMT ) on Wednesday , with a final vote expected on Thursday . 
President Bill Clinton has been conducting an intensive lobbying campaign for the Chemical Weapons Convention , seeking Senate approval in time for formal U.S. ratification by April 29 when the treaty goes into force , with or without the United States . 
the treaty has already been ratified by more than 70 countries . 
immediately after the agreement was announced by Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott , the Senate opened a brief debate on a separate bill opposed by the administration under which the United States would act unilaterally to meet the threat of chemical and biological weapons . 
the bill , backed by Lott , Helms and other conservatives , was approved 53-44 on a near party line vote . 
the White House called the measure &quot; deficient and unworkable &quot; alternative to the Chemical Weapons Convention .... a unilateral approach to a global problem that requires an international solution . 
it was unclear what effect approval of the bill would have on the prospects for the treaty . 
Treaty proponents said it could give senators a way to vote against poison gas while also voting against the treaty . 
the bill would ban chemical and biological weapons within the United States and require U.S. sanctions against other countries using them . 
it also would require continuing enhancements of American defences against chemical and biological weapons . 
Democrats complained it had been brought to the Senate without prior consideration , unlike the 1993 chemical weapons treaty which bans the development , production , stockpiling , transfer and use of chemical weapons . 
the treaty must not only get a two-thirds majority vote to win approval , but must also survive votes on amendments that its supporters say would kill U.S. participation in the pact . 
Helms , an implacable foe of the treaty , had demanded concessions on the treaty itself and on unrelated legislative goals . 
negotiations between Helms and Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware , the senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee , produced agreement on 28 conditions , declarations and understandings to the treaty . 
but the two remained at odds on five other conditions , including &quot; killer amendments &quot; that would torpedo U.S. participation in the treaty . 
among them were proposals to raise the standards of verification against cheating to unachievable levels and link U.S. participation to Russian ratification of the pact and compliance with an earlier agreement to destroy its poison gas stocks .
