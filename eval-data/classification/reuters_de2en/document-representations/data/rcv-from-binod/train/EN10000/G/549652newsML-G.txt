former Pakistan captain Salim Malik hit his 15th test century to ensure a draw in the second cricket test against Sri Lanka on Wednesday , leaving the two-test series tied 0-0 . 
Malik , 34-year-old veteran of 96 tests , hit a match-saving 155 to enable Pakistan to end the fifth and final day on 285 for five wickets in their second innings after being set a daunting target of 426 runs for victory in 121 overs . 
Malik , a model of concentration , batted for five hours and 38 minutes and struck 26 fours in a total scored from 240 balls . 
Malik and his brother-in-law Ijaz Ahmed , who made a painstaking 47 in 265 minutes with a six and seven fours , put on 127 for the third wicket which guaranteed Pakistan a draw at the Sinhalese Sports Club . 
the first test was also drawn . 
the pair , who started the day with Pakistan struggling at 28 for two , batted soundly throughout the morning session , adding 55 runs off 29 overs . 
Ijaz was dismissed 25 minutes before the tea break but Inzamam-ul-Haq joined Malik in a fourth-wicket stand which produced 121 runs in 100 minutes . 
Inzamam , playing fluently on both sides of the wicket , completed his half-century before bad light ended play . 
Sri Lanka used seven bowlers in their attempt to dislodge Malik , who made full use of three dropped chances to drag Pakistan to safety . 
Malik was dropped at 44 by Ruwan Kalpage , who spilled a return catch off his own off-spin bowling . 
Jayantha Silva gave him another life at extra-cover at 58 and then skipper Arjuna Ranatunga dropped him at 135 off Chaminda Vaas &apos;s first over with the second new ball . 
Ijaz too was dropped at 46 by Vaas at long-off . 
Sri Lanka needed to hold those chances on a pitch which offered hardly any encouragement to bowlers . 
Sri Lanka &apos;s Aravinda de Silva was named man of the match for the unprecedented feat of scoring an unbeaten century in each innings of a test . 
de Silva was also named man of the series , having scored an aggregate of 432 runs at an average of 216 .
