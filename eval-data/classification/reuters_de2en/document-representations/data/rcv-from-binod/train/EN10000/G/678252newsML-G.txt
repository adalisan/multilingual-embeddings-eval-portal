U.N. monitors appealed to the Angolan government on Saturday to halt military operations in the northeast of the country and told Jonas Savimbi &apos;s former rebels to stop harassing foreigners in the region . 
in his first official confirmation that fighting has erupted in the northeast between troops and former rebels , U.N. Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye said the army had moved into 10 border areas previously controlled by Savimbi &apos;s UNITA movement . 
he said there had been &quot; localised and small-scale combat &quot; between the the two sides involved in a U.N.-monitored disarmament and demobilisation programme . 
in a statement issued by the U.N. Angola Verification Mission ( UNAVEM ) on Saturday , he reminded the government of its obligation to report all military operations . 
he said this was reaffirmed at a meeting of the Joint Commission overseeing the implementation of a 1994 Lusaka peace accord between the Angolan government and Savimbi &apos;s National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) . 
Beye said reports of armed soldiers from Rwanda and the former Zaire crossing into Angola did not cancel the government &apos;s obligation to report its movements to UNAVEM . 
&quot; The Joint Commission has asked the government to cease its military operations and to place at UNAVEM &apos;s disposal all material proof relating to the existence of unidentified armed forces , &quot; he said . 
Beye also demanded information from UNITA about the activities of a presidential guard protecting Savimbi and of a previously unknown UNITA unit known as the &quot; mining police &quot; . 
&quot; The Joint Commission has expressed its concern at repeated and multiple hinderances and hostile acts carried out by members of UNITA against representatives of the international community in Angola and it appeals to the political leadership of UNITA for greater diligence in completing the remaining tasks required by the Lusaka protocol , &quot; he said . 
on Friday , Beye told reporters in Luanda that monitors who travelled to the northeast of the country had confirmed reports of new fighting . 
we know that there are some 10 towns in the northeast that have been occupied by the FAA , &quot; he said . 
diplomats and military officials in Luanda say the offensive in the diamond-rich Lunda Norte province is the biggest in more than two years and has resulted in fierce clashes between UNITA and FAA troops . 
UNITA and the government had fought from Angola &apos;s independence from Portugal in 1975 until they signed a peace accord in Lusaka , capital of neighbouring Zambia , in 1994 . 
UNITA entered into a power-sharing agreement with the government in April , but the former rebels continue to control vast areas including the diamond fields of the northeast . 
the government claims its military operations near the border are to prevent the flow of soldiers from the former Zaire and Rwanda , but UNITA says the actions are designed to take its areas by force .
