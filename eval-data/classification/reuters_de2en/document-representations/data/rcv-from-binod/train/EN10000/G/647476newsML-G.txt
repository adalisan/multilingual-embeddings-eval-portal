at least 28 people were killed in landslides triggered by torrential rains in the Himalayan mountains in northeastern India , a senior police official said on Monday . 
the police chief in Sikkim state , P.C. 
Sharma , said at least 30 people were injured overnight in the landslides in and around the state capital Gangtok . 
Sharma told Reuters in Calcutta by telephone that a four-storey building and two government bungalows collapsed in Gangtok , crushing eight people . 
the police chief said 24 bodies had so far been recovered and the army had been called out to assist in rescue and relief operations . 
other people were still believed buried under debris . 
mountainous Sikkim is hedged in by Tibet in the north , Nepal in the west and Bhutan in the east . 
it was annexed by India in 1975 after its legislature voted to abolish the monarchy and join the Indian union . 
landslides are common in the region during the monsoon , which usually hits Sikkim later in the year . 
Gangtok is ringed by steep mountains . 
&quot; We are accustomed to landslides here and there , but this time it &apos;s something very serious , &quot; Sharma said . 
the heavy rains disrupted power and water supplies , and the government restricted the movements of private vehicles and ordered offices closed for two days , he said .
