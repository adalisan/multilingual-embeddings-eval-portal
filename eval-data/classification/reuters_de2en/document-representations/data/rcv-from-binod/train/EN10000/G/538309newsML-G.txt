the San Diego Padres placed outfielder Steve Finley on the 15-day disabled list on Friday , retroactive to April 20 , with a sore left elbow . 
Finley has not started the last six games and last appeared as a pinch-hitter in the first game of a doubleheader last Saturday against St. Louis .

Finley is batting .220 ( 9-for-41 ) with a team-leading six doubles and nine RBI in 12 games this season . 
he enjoyed a career-best season for the Padres in 1996 with 30 homers , 95 RBI and a .298 batting average . 
Plantier , who has twice before been up with the Padres , was batting .429 ( 24-for-56 ) with five homers and nine RBI for Las Vegas .
