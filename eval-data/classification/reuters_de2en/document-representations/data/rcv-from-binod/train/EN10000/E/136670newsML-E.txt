lower international commodity prices were the main factor behind Chile &apos;s widening trade deficit , which came to $ 325 million in the first nine months of the year against a $ 1.4 billion surplus in the same period 1995 . 
&quot; This deficit in the trade balance has been the result fundamentally of the fall in international prices of our products , &quot; said the central bank in its monthly report . 
lower prices for products ranging from copper to fishmeal have meant that the sharp increase in export volumes has failed to be reflected in the trade figures , it said . 
the fall in prices has been widely expected as commodity prices were unusually high last year , it said . 
Central bank figures showed a $ 229 million trade deficit in September compared with a $ 23.5 million deficit in the same month last year . 
exports fell to $ 1.03 billion last month , down 13 percent on the same period last year . 
the decline was led by main exports other than copper which dropped 28 percent last month on the same period 1995 . 
this category includes methanol , down 50 percent , fishmeal , down 46 percent and bleached wood pulp exports which fell 38 percent on September last year . 
copper exports dropped 19 percent with the rise in export volumes unable to make up for a 33 percent drop in prices over the last year . 
non-traditional exports , which include wine and software , rose 11 percent last month , but this failed to compensate for the fall in commodity exports , it said . 
imports rose three percent last month to $ 1.3 billion . 
imports of consumer goods grew 13 percent with capital goods imports up five percent and intermediate goods imports down one percent . 
the following are details of Chilean exports and imports in September 1996 .
