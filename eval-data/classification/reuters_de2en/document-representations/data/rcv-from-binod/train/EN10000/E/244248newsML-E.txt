most Britons expect to spend more this Christmas than last , a survey published by an international property agency on Monday shows . 
people expected to spend 23-1 / 2 billion stg this Christmas , up 700 million stg from last year representing an extra 0.4 percent of total annual retail sales , the poll said . 
the poll , which was undertaken for Healey &amp; Baker by RSL Research on 2,000 British adults , asked consumers for a detailed breakdown of how much they expect to spend in Christmas 1996 . 
&quot; People from all over the country are deciding to spend more , &quot; said John Strachan , head of retail agency at Healey &amp; Baker . 
&quot; This expected increase in Christmas expenditure is mirrored by the recent surge in demand from retailers for new retail space and the rents and premiums they are prepared to pay to get it , &quot; Strachan said .
