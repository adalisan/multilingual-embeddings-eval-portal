water poisoning has killed at least 13 people in Bangladesh in recent months , raising a health alarm , doctors said on Thursday . 
health teams in southern Bagerhat district have sealed many shallow wells after they tested positive for arsenic , a poisonous , semi-metallic chemical element . 
they have asked local authorities to sink deep tubewells on an emergency basis . 
&quot; Thousands of people are exposed to grave threats because of pollution or poisoning by high contents of arsenic in sub-soil water , &quot; one doctor with the Public Health Department said . 
doctors said they had detected &quot; definite cases of arsenic poisoning &quot; during a survey on Tuesday at some villages in Ishwardi sub-division in Pabna district , also in the north . 
Dr. Fazlul Huq , civil surgeon in Pabna , said he had found around 100 &quot; definite &quot; cases of arsenic poisoning , with patients suffering from chronic skin rashes and deteriorating health . 
&quot; We visited at least 50 households in some five villages and each family has one or two members with positive symptoms , &quot; he told Reuters on Thursday . 
Dr. Mohammad Shah Newaj , a skin specialist at the Pabna Hospital , also confirmed several deaths and illnesses caused by arsenic . 
health officials in Dhaka said they would soon send a high-level expert team to Bagerhat , Ishwardi and neigbouring areas to investigate arsenic pollution . 
the government may also seek help from international agencies to determine the causes of the pollution and ways to overcome it , one official said .
