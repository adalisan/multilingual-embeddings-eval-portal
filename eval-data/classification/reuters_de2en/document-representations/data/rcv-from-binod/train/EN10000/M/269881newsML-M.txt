Jakarta shares prices closed up on Friday but profit-taking pulled them off their highs for the day , brokers said . 
they said the market had received a boost from locally-led speculative buying in some secondaries coupled with positive sentiment from Thursday &apos;s sharp rise in New York . 
the composite index rose 4.21 points , or 0.67 percent , to 632.52 points after touching a high of 635.35 . 
brokers and analysts said the market was likely to be mixed on Monday with some investors sidelined as the Christmas holiday approached . 
&quot; Volume-wise , trading will be quieter . 
but the index could stay on the positive side on speculative buying , &quot; an analyst in a local firm said . 
brokers said retail and consumer counters Matahari Putra Prima and multipolar could remain a focus for the market in the coming week on speculation they were discussing an alliance . 
neither company has commented on the market talk . 
multipolar rose 25 rupiah to 1,675 on 13 million shares after earlier rising to 1,750 rupiah . 
Matahari was down 175 rupiah to 2,725 on 1.6 million shares . 
hero supermarket and Mayora Indah also traded actively on fresh buying , brokers said . 
&quot; Besides all the rumours , the retail and consumer sectors seem promising in 1997 with consumer spending likely to rise following the downtrend in interest rates and stable economic growth , &quot; an analyst from a Korean firm said . 
brokers said there was only limited market reaction to a presidential decree ordering wealthy individuals and companies to donate two percent of their profits to the poor . 
&quot; We had already heard about it two weeks ago but it is still not clear . 
I think the market shrugged off the news today as it enjoyed positive sentiment from Wall Street , &quot; an analyst from a Singapore-based firm said .
