yields on benchmark three-year corporate bonds closed lower on Tuesday due to an improved liquidity after the central bank &apos;s emergency fund supply to the banking system , dealers said . 
three-month CD yields closed unchanged and overnight call rate fell slightly , they said . 
* 3-yr corporates close at 12.02 PCT vs Monday &apos;s 12.07 
* 3-mth CDs end flat at 12.65 PCT 
* average overnight call rate at 12.5 PCT vs Monday &apos;s 13.0 
&quot; Traders appeared to be assured that the government was determined to keep the interest rates stable , &quot; said a Daewoo Securities dealer . 
despite the improved liquidity , dealers forecast the benchmark yields would not fall sharply due to an expected rise in cash demand ahead of Lunar New Year holidays . 
lunar New Year holidays fall on February 7-9 this year . 
&quot; I see the three-year yields moving in a 12.0-12.5 percent range for the time being , &quot; said a Hanwha Securities dealer .
