President Bill Clinton on Monday launched a Democratic Convention-linked barrage of policy initiatives by calling for a ban on the sale of handguns to people convicted of domestic violence . 
Clinton unveiled the anti-crime proposal , which was designed to widen the gender gap which gives him an edge over Republican Bob Dole among women voters , as he started the second leg of 559-mile train trip to Chicago , where party activists were gathered to renominate him . 
speaking at the Columbus Police Academy , with lines of police as his backdrop , Clinton said public safety should not be a partisan issue but &quot; an American issue . 
&quot; Under the current law , thousands of people who are wife- beaters or child abusers ... can still buy handguns with potentially deadly consequences , &quot; Clinton said . 
&quot; I believe strongly in the right of Americans to own guns . 
&quot; But make no mistake : those who threaten the safety of others do not deserve our trust , &quot; he said . 
a White House statement said there were 88,500 incidents of domestic violence in 1994 where a firearm was present . 
over a 10-year period ending that year , it said 65 law enforcement officers were killed when responding to family quarrels . 
many spousal abusers are not now affected by a ban on the sale of firearms to convicted felons because many domestic violence cases are treated as misdemeanors . 
Clinton &apos;s proposal would expand the Brady Bill , which requires a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases to run background checks and which bans felons from buying guns . 
Clinton also called for banning cop-killer bullets , saying every law enforcement group backs it and Congress should too . 
&quot; If a bullet can slice through a bulletproof vest like a hot knife through butter , it should be against the law , &quot; he said . 
Clinton , on an old-fashioned whistlestop train tour through the Midwest with his daughter Chelsea , 16 , while his wife Hillary conducted a separate schedule in her hometown of Chicago , intended to grab headlines with a new proposal every day of his trip . 
Tuesday &apos;s will concern education ; Wednesday &apos;s , the environment . 
his focus on crime was designed to tie into the opening session of the convention , which featured a speech by Sarah Brady , wife of former White House spokesman James Brady , whose wounding inspired the gun law . 
Brady is wheelchair-bound because of the gunshot wounds he suffered when John Hinckley Jr. tried to kill then-President Ronald Reagan in 1981 . 
Clinton , campaigning through five states with 64 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency on his way to Chicago , is on the 559-mile trip to energise grassroots support for his re-election bid . 
in a USA Today / CNN poll released on Monday , Clinton held a 12 percentage point lead over Dole among registered voters , beating the Republican 50-38 with independent Ross Perot winning only 7 percent . 
Clinton boarded his &quot; 21st Century Express &quot; for the four-day whistlestop in Huntington , West Virginia , on Sunday and rolled through parts of Kentucky before reaching Ohio . 
his train will also travel through Michigan and Indiana . 
as he has at every previous stop , Clinton slammed the tax cut proposal at the heart of Dole &apos;s campaign . 
&quot; We cannot afford to blow a hole in the deficit again , &quot; he said . 
Clinton was heckled at the start of his speech by a small group of demonstrators , but he silenced them by saying they did not want the American people to know of his record . 
if the public learns the truth , Clinton said , his opponents &quot; won &apos;t have a chance .
