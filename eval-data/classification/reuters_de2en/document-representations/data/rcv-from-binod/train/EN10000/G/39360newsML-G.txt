Ireland has tentatively set the date of October 5 for a special European Union summit to discuss the 15-nation bloc &apos;s future , EU diplomats said on Saturday . 
EU foreign ministers , meeting in the southern Irish town of Tralee for a two-day retreat , were expected to confirm the date over the weekend , they said . 
Ireland was asked to host a special summit when EU leaders last met in June in Florence , Italy . 
the idea was for the leaders to get together for informal discussions about the bloc &apos;s future and progress of the inter-governmental conference , the bloc &apos;s treaty negotiations . 
a similar meeting was held on the Spanish island of Majorca in September last year . 
finding a date when all 15 countries could meet has proved difficult , with many countries turning down previous suggestions as being inconvenient .
