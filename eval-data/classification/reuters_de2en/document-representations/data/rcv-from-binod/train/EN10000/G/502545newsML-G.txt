a strong earthquake jolted northwestern China &apos;s Xinjiang region on Friday , killing at least eight people and seriously injuring 25 in an area rocked by thousands of tremors in recent months , officials said . 
the earthquake measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale struck Jiashi in the northwestern Xinjiang region at 1.34 p.m. ( 0534 GMT ) , a local broadcasting official said by telephone . 
&quot; This earthquake was very sudden , &quot; the official said . 
&quot; We had no preparation . 
at least eight people were killed and 25 seriously hurt and the toll was set to rise as rescue teams searched for survivors in remote villages , an official of the Seismological Bureau in the nearby city of Kashgar said by telephone . 
units of the People &apos;s Liberation Army had been deployed to help with rescue efforts in the region , populated mainly by cotton farmers and sheep herders of the Moslem Uighur minority . 
a large number of buildings had been destroyed by the tremor , officials said . 
detailed figures were not yet available . 
&quot; There have been so many earthquakes here recently that no one dares to go home and we are all living in tents , &quot; one hospital official said . 
&quot; The casualties this time were because buildings collapsed on tents nearby . 
&quot; The earth never seems to stop shaking , &quot; she said . 
&quot; But today the earthquake felt even stronger than before . 
officials said 23 people were injured and thousands of buildings destroyed last Sunday when two large earthquakes just five hours apart hit Jiashi . 
no deaths were reported from Sunday &apos;s tremors , mainly because most residents have been living out of doors and in tents since an earthquake measuring 6.4 rocked Jiashi in January , killing 50 people , officials said . 
more than 4,000 earthquakes and aftershocks have jolted the region since January , and seismologists have warned of more . 
on March 20 , an earthquake measuring 6.9 hit Jiashi , killing 24 people and injuring 40 . 
that came just days after a tremor of 6.0 magnitude left two people dead and injured three . 
many of the region &apos;s residents live in earthen houses that are easily damaged by earthquakes . 
scientist Ding Jianhai forecast earlier on Friday that Jiashi would be jolted soon by an earthquake of about five on the Richter scale , Xinhua reported . 
&quot; The quakes hitting the area have shown no obvious signs of decline in terms of magnitude in the near future , &quot; it quoted Ding , of the State Seismological Bureau , as saying . 
officials said it was rare for so many strong quakes to hit in the same place at such short intervals , said Ding , head of the Department of Earthquake prediction and Analysis . 
Jiashi county lies at the meeting of the Pamir-Lake Baikal seismological belt and the seismological belt of the Himalayas , making it an area vulnerable to frequent tremors , Ding said . 
in 1961 , three earthquakes measuring more than six on the Richter scale jolted Jiashi , and after-shocks continued for 20 months , he said .
