Mexican overnight Cetes rates ended up 40 basis points at 22.00 percent on Monday due to heavy selling at the close of trade , dealers said . 
&quot; Some one must have hung on to their cash and had to step in to buy at a high rate before the bell . 
there were three hefty last-minute trades , &quot; a dealer said . 
overnight Cetes rates had reached an early low of 20.80 percent on what traders put down to a firm peso . 
benchmark 48-hour peso contracts closed 3.5 centavos stronger at 7.8900 / 7.8920 per dollar . 
overnight rates on bank paper closed down five basis points at 23 percent . 
dealers noted foreign investors were accounted for most trading , which was light as many brokers closed their books for the month last Thursday . 
Mexican financial markets were closed on March 21 and will close again for Easter holidays on March 27 and 28 . 
dealers did not expect Tuesday &apos;s U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting to have a great impact on domestic secondary rates . 
&quot; We feel U.S. rates will rise 25 basis points , but the Mexican money market has already discounted that , &apos; a trader said . 
a sign of market calm ahead of the FOMC meeting was that traders forecast slight falls in domestic primary interest rates at Monday evening &apos;s primary auction . 
a Reuters survey of nine Mexico City money market traders nN24543416 showed they forecast bellwether 28-day Cetes rates would fall by an average of 66 basis points to 21.04 percent . 
Banco de Mexico put its weekly auction of government securities ahead by one day as public holidays will cut the working week short . 
Banco de Mexico drained 1.473 billion pesos from the market through three auctions at which it assigned at rates of between 22.75-23.05 percent . 
liquidity of 1.388 billion pesos was scheduled to return to the system from prior central bank participation . 
nonetheless , traders said demand for cash prior to the Easter holidays would squeeze market liquidity .
