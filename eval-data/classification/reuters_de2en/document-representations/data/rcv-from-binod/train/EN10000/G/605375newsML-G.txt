South Korean political turmoil surrounding the arrest of President Kim Young-sam &apos;s son is likely to add new twists on the road to peace talks with North Korea , analysts said on Thursday . 
they said North Korea may use the turmoil as another reason not to deal with Kim , who for years has been vilified daily as a &quot; traitor &quot; by the Stalinist government &apos;s official media . 
Pyongyang would intensify efforts to stall for time and avoid dealing with Seoul if , as appears likely , the scandal enfeebles Kim &apos;s administration eight months before his term as president ends next year . 
&quot; North Korea has consistently said that it would never enter into dialogue with South Korea as long as Kim remained in power , &quot; said a North Korea analyst at Radiopress , a Tokyo-based news agency . 
&quot; Now the North has intensified its anti-Kim message , which treats the scandal as the demise of his government , which it has long hoped for , &quot; the analyst said . 
Kim is already being tagged a lame duck in Seoul since the arrest last week of his son , Kim Hyun-chul , on suspicion of taking bribes worth millions of dollars and evading taxes . 
the weakening of Kim , which began with a corruption scandal that surfaced after Hanbo Steel Co collapsed in January and has manifested itself in watered down labour legislation and caution towards economic reforms , has been greeted with unvarnished glee by North Korea &apos;s propaganda machine . 
&quot; The arrest of Kim Hyun-chul is directly connected to the destruction of Kim Young-sam , &quot; the official Korean Central News Agency said in a commentary on the scandal this week . 
&quot; Kim Young-sam should have been taken to prison together with his son , &quot; a separate KCNA report said . 
&quot; The arrest of Kim Hyun-chul is a crafty trick employed by his father in a bid to save himself . 
North Korea &apos;s anti-Kim campaign has heated up as South Korea and its ally the United States await Pyongyang &apos;s response to a peace talk proposal they floated in April of last year . 
Kim and President Bill Clinton called on North Korea to join Seoul , Washington and Beijing in four-way talks to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula and end the &quot; state of war &quot; which has technically existed between the two Koreas since the end of fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War . 
at talks in New York last month , North Korea turned down proposals to join the four-party negotiations . 
U.S. officials have said , however , that they are confident Pyongyang will eventually come to the table if convinced that doing so will win precious food aid to ease the plight of its famine-hit population . 
a Japan-based North Korean supporter , who declined to be identified , said even if four-way talks are held , Pyongyang &apos;s representatives would go out of their way to deal only with the U.S. negotiators and ignore their South Korean counterparts . 
recent events suggest North Korea &apos;s dire economic situation and fears of famine have not made it any more willing to deal directly with South Korea , which has held out the prospect of massive aid if Pyongyang negotiates peace in earnest . 
inter-Korean Red Cross talks on speeding food aid to North Korea resume on Friday in Beijing after talks earlier this month broke down when the North demanded to know how much aid it could expect before discussing delivery methods and venues . 
the Radiopress analyst declined to predict if the North would accept a South Korean Red Cross proposal to send food directly north through the land border at Panmunjom , instead of by sea or via China through the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies . 
but he said broader North-South contacts and dialogue that Seoul hopes for was unlikely to come during Kim Young-sam &apos;s remaining months in office , his son &apos;s scandal notwithstanding . 
&quot; North Korea &apos;s hatred of Kim Young-sam stems from the South Korean president &apos;s refusal to express condolences when North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung died in July 1994 , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But the structural nature of the Korean conflict won &apos;t change even under Kim &apos;s successor , because the survival of North Korea &apos;s government requires continued hostility to the South , &quot; the analyst said .
