the zloty inched up in early Wednesday trade as banks cut currency positions for the weekend and so far the Polish unit has remained immune to controversy surrounding next year &apos;s budget , dealers said . 
&quot; There was some currency selling in early trade with the zloty mainly tracking dollar / mark rates ... and so far strongly worded statements about next year &apos;s budget have not had any effect , &quot; said Karol Zaluski of ING Bank in Warsaw . 
at 0850 GMT the zloty was at 1.54 / 1.51 percent from parity , up from opening at 1.53 / 1.47 . 
it was 3.2338 / 42 per dollar , flat from opening and at 1.8800 / 10 per mark , up from 1.8805 / 35 . 
the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) said Poland needed to balance the budget by 1999 at the latest and quickly tighten its monetary policy to keep its quickly widening current account and trade deficit capped . 
on Tuesday the central bank said that Poland needed to balance next year &apos;s budget in order to avoid a Czech-style financial crisis , but the government dismissed its advice and said it would not cut 1998 spending before September elections . 
dealers expected yields to rise at Wednesday &apos;s 600 million zloty 52-week T-bill auction , the last tender this week , to around 21.65-21.70 percent from Monday &apos;s 21.62 percent . 
on the money market one-day rates held just below the 25-percent Lombard rate as the market turned dry during the last week of the monthly reserve period , dealers said . 
overnight rates were flat from opening levels at 24.40 / 24.95 percent , while tomorrow / next were at 24.40 / 24.90 percent at 0920 GMT , up from Tuesday &apos;s 22.75 / 22.90 .
