Japan &apos;s current account surplus for fiscal 1997 / 98 is likely to be bigger than government expectations , Economic Planning Agency Vice Minister Shimpei Nukaya told a news conference on Friday . 
&quot; The government forecast for the current account balance &apos;s ( surplus &apos;s ) ratio to GDP ( gross domestic product ) in fiscal year 1997 / 98 is around 1.3 percent . 
I don &apos;t think the number will fall within the 1.3 percent forecast , &quot; Nukaya said . 
he added that it was too early to make predictions , but taking into account the April-June current account data , the fact that overseas economies , especially the United States , are expanding , and the strength in Japanese exports , it is inevitable that the current account surplus will grow more than expected . 
he said growth in the current account surplus in the April-June period was excessive due to special factors , and that such rapid growth was unlikely to continue . 
compared with the January-March period , economic data for the April-June period would probably show that growth had received significant support from external demand , he added . 
Nukaya said private-sector machinery orders for the April-June period were lower than expected and they showed that capital spending was not growing very strongly . 
he added , however , that because Japan expects corporate capital spending growth of around six to seven percent for the fiscal year as a whole , growth of about one to two percent on a quarterly basis is not much of a cause for pessimism . 
&quot; The April-June figure was more gradual than expected . 
overall , however , the July-September forecast is still positive and the recovery trend in capital spending remains unchanged , &quot; he said . 
Nukaya said a drop in June household spending in Japan was partly due to the termination this year of a special income tax cut , which was felt particularly strongly in June , the month in which tax refunds are passed to taxpayers . 
on Tuesday , the Management and Coordination Agency said Japan &apos;s household spending in June fell 4.7 percent in real terms from a year earlier . 
&quot; Although I wouldn &apos;t go so far as to say that consumption is strong , there may be misunderstandings depending on the month ( one is looking at ) , &quot; Nukaya said .
