traces of the deadly bacteria responsible for a mass food poisoning epidemic this summer have been found in a fly caught in western Japan , researchers said on Friday . 
they said health officials in saga prefecture , western Japan , found the O-157 bacillus in one of 40 flies collected in and around a place where there were a cluster of food poisoning cases . 
&quot; We haven &apos;t heard of any cases in the past in which flies have caused the ( O-157 ) infection and we are waiting for instructions from the health minister , &quot; a saga health official told Reuters . 
officials did not reveal the name or location of the place to avoid causing panic or discrimination . 
the saga health official said researchers had not found the bacteria in any other part of the facility and were puzzled as to how the fly came to carry the germ . 
the O-157 bacillus killed 11 people and made more than 9,000 ill in Japan earlier this year . 
the city of Sakai , near Osaka in western Japan , was hit hardest , with nearly 6,500 people , mostly school children , affected by the germ . 
health authorities believe school lunches were the source of the food poisoning which hit Sakai , but researchers have been unable to locate the exact source of the infection . 
since the outbreak , researchers have also found traces of the killer germ in raw cow &apos;s liver , tripe and raw vegetable salads , but could not determine any definite source of the mass infection . 
in August , the government declared the food poisoning epidemic a contagious disease . 
this means doctors are required to report O-157 cases to authorities and patients who are suspected of having the disease must undergo a physical examination .
