Palestinian President Yasser Arafat told European ministers on Tuesday that Jewish settlements were incompatible with peace and that Europe was well placed to save talks on Middle East peace . 
in a speech to foreign ministers from the European Union and its Mediterranean neighbours , he compared the current right-wing Israeli government unfavourably with the previous government of assassinated prime minister Yitzhak Rabin . 
&quot; With the current Israeli government we have faced many obstacles and impediments ... Instead of continuing to build and reinforce fruitful cooperation and mutual respect , which was set up by the government of Yitzhak Rabin , the Israeli government continues its settlement policy . 
&quot; We have been running around in closed circles without reaching any kind of positive agreement , &quot; he said . 
Arafat cited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s decision last month to go ahead with a Jewish settlement in disputed East Jerusalem . 
the decision has led to daily clashes in the West Bank and has brought peace talks to stalemate . 
&quot; Peace and settlements are two opposites . 
Israeli settlement activities in the Palestinian territories and East Jerusalem ... undermine the peace process and demolish the principle of land for peace , &quot; he added . 
Arafat also said that Israel &apos;s restrictions on the West Bank had seriously damaged the Palestinian economy , pushing the unemployment rate up to 60 percent and causing losses of $ 9 million a day to Palestinians . 
&quot; I am warning you of the dangers of this comprehensive military and economic siege ... It will definitely strangle the peace process if this continues , &quot; he added . 
&quot; We are relying on an effective European role to save the peace process from its current crisis . 
Europe has the ability ... to play a dynamic role , to find the best mechanisms to bring it back on the right track . 
&quot; We welcome the European initiative and we are ready to cooperate with it in order to make it succeed . 
last week Europe proposed to the United States , the main Middle East mediator , a code of conduct for Israelis and Palestinians but this initiative has not made much ground . 
in Malta , the EU is trying to bring Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy together with either Arafat or his planning minister , Nabil Shaath . 
Shaath said on Tuesday he would meet Levy . 
but the Palestinians and their Arab allies say they doubt a single meeting will lead to any breakthrough .
