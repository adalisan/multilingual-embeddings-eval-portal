Taiwan Premier LIEN Chan on Monday urged the World Trade Organisation to accelerate its membership application , saying it was &quot; unfair &quot; for the island to wait for rival Beijing &apos;s accession . 
state-funded Central News Agency quoted LIEN as telling visiting U.S. former senator Bob Dole that his government had made all possible efforts and commitments to qualify as a member of the world trade club . 
&quot; It is unfair that our entry is postponed because of Chinese communists &apos; endless delay , &quot; LIEN was quoted as saying . 
Taiwan has progressively liberalised many markets in its zeal to enter the WTO but faces a daunting political obstacle as long as rival China &apos;s WTO bid remains stalled . 
rival China , which regards Taiwan as a renegade province since a civil war split them in 1949 , has said it would accept Taiwan &apos;s WTO membership as a customs territory -- but only after China itself is allowed entry . 
Taiwan applied in 1990 to join the WTO &apos;s predecessor , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , as a customs territory under the name of Chinese Taipei . 
Taiwan has said it wanted to become a WTO member in 1997 . 
Taiwan trade representatives began two-day bilateral negotiations with Hong Kong in Tokyo on Monday . 
Hong Kong was one of the eight WTO members with which Taiwan still must complete bilateral talks . 
agreements have been reached with the other 18 members that sought such talks .
