the National Bank of Hungary &apos;s ( NBH ) one percent base rate cut is in line with the decline of inflation and might have also been instigated by the government decision to delay energy price hikes , analysts said on Friday . 
the NBH reduced its base rate to 24.50 percent earlier on Friday from 25.50 . 
&quot; It was noticeable that in the past two months the central bank intensified the reduction of rates , &quot; GKI Research Institute &apos;s Judit Barta said . 
&quot; My interpretation is that the central bank believes that inflation is declining , &quot; she added . 
&quot; It is likely to be in accordance with the decline of interest rates which took speed in the past two or three weeks , &quot; Postabank Securities &apos; Attila Torok said . 
monthly inflation was 0.4 percent in July , down from 0.9 percent in June , while year-on-year inflation slowed to 23 percent from 23.6 percent . 
the annual yield on twelve-month Treasury bills dropped to 23.69 percent at an auction earlier on Friday , compared with 25.00 percent one month ago . 
analysts said the central bank &apos;s base rate has usually closely followed the money market since Hungary introduced a pre-announced forint devaluation system last March . 
however , the base rate cut , which was larger than some analysts expected , could have also been encouraged by changed inflation expectations following the government &apos;s decision on Thursday to delay energy price hikes from October until January , analysts added . 
&quot; If the government puts off the energy price rises , this will also slow down inflation , &quot; Citibank &apos;s Csaba Varga said . 
the rate of the energy price hike has not been decided yet , but the government said it was below 40 percent . 
the delay in the energy price hikes mean that year-on-year inflation will drop by some 1.5 to two percent by December and will be around the 20 percent government target , analyst said . 
the government decision will reduce expected annual inflation by only a few tenths of a percentage point from some 24 percent , compared with 28.2 percent in 1995 , but it will substantially reduce the households &apos; heating costs , they added . 
Torok said the central bank is also likely to cut its repo rates in the near future , and the base rate cut makes probable that the repo rate cut will be larger than previously expected . 
&quot; Perhaps they will cut the repo by half percentage point now instead of 0.25 percentage point , &quot; he said .
