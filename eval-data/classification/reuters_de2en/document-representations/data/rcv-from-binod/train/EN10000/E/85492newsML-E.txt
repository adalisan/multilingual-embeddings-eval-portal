Spain &apos;s tough 1997 budget is convincing and credible on paper , but its fulfilment hinges on sufficient economic growth , economists said on Monday . 
&quot; ( The budget ) is too optimistic and aggressive , but it isn &apos;t impossible , &quot; said Alfredo Urrutia , chief economist at Societe Generale in Madrid . 
early on Monday Economy Minister Rodrigo Rato delivered to parliament an austere budget the five-month-old conservative government hopes will place Spain among the first group of countries to join a European single currency in 1999 . 
Rato said the assumptions underlying the budget for revenues and expenditures were &quot; absolutely realistic &quot; , and that spending could be curtailed with a &quot; reasonable effort &quot; . 
the budget foresees revenue growth in 1997 of just under six percent , the rough equivalent of the economy &apos;s nominal growth . 
gross domestic product growth is seen at a real three percent . 
spending growth will be capped at 1.7 percent -- which represents an expenditure cut of nearly one percentage point given inflation forecasts of some 2.6 percent . 
&quot; It &apos;s a very restrictive budget . 
the danger is that the revenues won &apos;t grow as forecast because of smaller than expected growth in GDP , &quot; said Antonio Pulido , director of Estrategias Financieras at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya . 
this budget could withstand GDP growth of just 2.5 percent in 1997 , but subsequent budgets would have to address the longer-term strategic problems stemming from draining the public purse , Pulido added . 
&quot; One of the weakest points of the scenario is the forecast for GDP growth of three percent in 1997 . 
I believe it &apos;s somewhat risky to bet on a relatively optimistic GDP growth rate , because if it isn &apos;t achieved the deficit objective could be missed , &quot; another Spanish bank analyst said . 
Rato did not rule out the application of compensatory measures should economic growth next year not live up to government forecasts . 
&quot; The growth forecasts are realistic and reflect the evolution of the economy in 1996 , &quot; Rato said . 
&quot; But measures to control expenditure will be applied if forecasts are not fulfilled . 
the budget foresees a central government deficit of two trillion pesetas , 23 percent narrower than in 1996 , or 2.5 percent of GDP . 
the deficit to GDP including social security and the regional governments is forecast at three percent . 
Carmen Alcaide , analyst at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya , said the government &apos;s decision to insist on cutting expenditure rather than devising ways to boost revenue introduced greater rigour in the fulfilment of the deficit objective . 
&quot; The government has had to make a serious effort on the cost side , &quot; Alcaide said . 
important cuts in public spending in trillions of pesetas unless specified .
