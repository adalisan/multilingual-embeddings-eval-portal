the servicing of Kenya &apos;s external debt has proved extremely difficult and put economic reform programmes at risk , Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi said . 
returning from a tour of Europe and the United States , Mudavadi said on Sunday that servicing a $ 6.3 billion foreign debt had placed a huge obstacle in the path of Kenya &apos;s economic changes . 
&quot; The current debt situation has put the country &apos;s adjustment and reform efforts at risk , &quot; Mudavadi said in remarks broadcast by the state-run Kenya Broadcasting Corporation ( KCB ) television and also carried by daily newspapers in Nairobi . 
in his annual budget Mudavadi gave the ratio of external debt to gross domestic product as 76.1 percent . 
according to finance ministry officials the foreign debt is equivalent to four times total export earnings , and 23 percent of current export earnings are committed to financing foreign debt . 
Mudavadi said Kenya would not immediately benefit from a multibillion-dollar international debt relief plan because it was currently seen as capable of adequately servicing its debt . 
creditor nations meeting in Washington last week agreed to increase assistance to the world &apos;s poorest debtor countries in a multibillion-dollar international plan seen in Africa as good for those committed to growth . 
under the initiative launched by international finance ministers meeting in Washington up to 80 percent of debts would be forgiven , compared with a 67 percent ceiling now . 
the debt-relief initiative -- involving the Paris Club of creditor countries , the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank -- is aimed at putting debt-ridden poor nations , many of them in Africa , back on their feet . 
Kenya has implemented wide-ranging economic changes since Mudavadi &apos;s appointment as finance minister in 1993 . 
these have included removal of foreign currency restrictions and reduction of trade tariffs and agricultural subsidies .
