U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright tried on Thursday to ease Russia &apos;s concerns over NATO &apos;s eastward expansion and the Western defence alliance put forward a proposal for big conventional arms cuts . 
Albright began two days of talks in Moscow as NATO officials presented the arms reduction plan to a body in Vienna dealing with the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe ( CFE ) treaty . 
Moscow wants the treaty revised and NATO intended the proposal as a sweetener to Russia over the expansion issue . 
Albright held separate meetings with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov , who have led Moscos &apos;s campaign against the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation &apos;s plans to admit former Warsaw Pact states . 
her visit culminates with a meeting on Friday with President Boris Yeltsin , during which the U.S. official said she would hand over a letter from U.S. President Bill Clinton . 
Yeltsin &apos;s press secretary , Sergei Yastrzhembsky , said before Albright arrived that Russia remained implacably opposed to NATO expansion , which it regards as a threat to its security . 
&quot; ( Our opposition ) will remain , whatever the outcome of the negotiations between Russia and the Atlantic alliance , &quot; Interfax news agency quoted him as saying . 
Russian and U.S. officials played down the chances of a breakthrough during Albright &apos;s visit , part of her inaugural worldwide tour as secretary of state , but NATO leaders hope for progress when Clinton and Yeltsin meet in Helsinki next month . 
the proposal in Vienna , which will go before a working group next Tuesday , is intended to address Russian fears that NATO could pile up weapons on its borders . 
&quot; Specifically , the total of future aggregate national ceilings of ground treaty limited equipment of ( NATO &apos;s ) 16 members will be significantly less under the adapted treaty , &quot; the proposal said . 
it would also establish a &quot; sensitive geographic region &quot; in central Europe , comprising the Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad , Ukraine , Slovakia , Belarus , the Czech Republic , Hungary and Poland , in which ground equipment could not be increased . 
NATO is also offering a charter defining NATO-Russian relations and creating a joint NATO-Russian military brigade , mainly to be used in peacekeeping . 
Yastrzhembsky repeated the Kremlin &apos;s demand for a legally binding contract providing security guarantees for Russia in the event of NATO &apos;s expansion . 
&quot; The conclusion of such a document would be not a gift to Russia but a demonstration of healthy pragmatism by the Western countries , based on their understanding of their own interests of national security , &quot; he said . 
the foreign ministers of Italy and Germany , who both visited Moscow this week trying to sell NATO &apos;s plans , found a rare unanimity among Russians across the political spectrum . 
&quot; NATO is an instrument of the Cold War and we have only just learned to live without the Cold War , &quot; the communist speaker of the State Duma lower house of parliament , Gennady Seleznyov , told Italy &apos;s Lamberto Dini . 
Dini said after his talks in Moscow that Italy believed NATO expansion could &quot; only take place with the consensus of Russia and not against its will .
