Argentine international Federico Mendez on Friday joined English rugby union champions bath from South African provincial side Natal . 
Director of rugby John Hall said Mendez , who can play both at prop and hooker , would join the club in the near future . 
Mendez has been selected to tour England with the Pumas later this month but says he will not travel in protest at &quot; archaic &quot; amateur attitudes towards professional rugby in Argentina .
