Chinese President Jiang Zemin proposed a plan on Monday to improve ties with South Asian neighbours and disclaimed any ambitions for regional dominance . 
&quot; China will never seek hegemony for itself , &quot; he told Pakistan &apos;s Senate ( upper house ) on the second day of a four-day visit to a long-standing regional ally . 
&quot; China stands ready to live harmoniously ... on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence , &quot; he said . 
Jiang proposed that China and South Asian nations broaden exchanges and deepen traditional friendship , respect each other as equals , promote mutual benefit and common development , properly handle existing disputes and work together towards a better future . 
&quot; We are ready to join hands with the South Asian countries in building a friendly and good-neighbourly relationship that is long-term , stable and oriented towards the 21st century ... &quot; 
&quot; We should look at the differences or disputes from a long-term perspective , seeking a just and reasonable settlement through consultations and negotiations while bearing in mind the larger picture , &quot; he said . 
&quot; If certain issues cannot be resolved for the time being , they may be shelved temporarily so that they will not affect the normal state-to-state relations . 
Jiang did not refer to any specific problem , but may have had in mind China &apos;s border dispute with India . 
he signed an agreement aimed at reducing border tension during his visit to India last week , the first by a Chinese president . 
he made no reference to Pakistan &apos;s long-standing quarrel with India over the Himalayan region of Kashmir , which Islamabad says is the main source of instability in South Asia . 
Jiang said China sincerely hoped that the region would enjoy long-term stability and vigorous economic development . 
&quot; China will , as always , support South Asian regional cooperation , support the proposal and initiative for the establishment of a South Asia nuclear-free zone and Indian Ocean zone of peace , and support all efforts designed to serve peace , stability and development of the South Asian region . 
Jiang said that while the world was undergoing what he called structural transition , &quot; it is necessary for our two sides to step up consultation , cooperate closely and come to each other &apos;s support in international affairs &quot; . 
Members of the 83-seat Senate gave Jiang a standing ovation as he appeared in a large hall built to accommodate the 217-member National Assembly ( lower house ) or joint sessions of the two chambers of parliament to honour state visitors . 
Senate members were scattered thinly through the hall in the absence of deputies in the National Assembly , which President Farooq Leghari dissolved on November 5 when he sacked Benazir Bhutto &apos;s government on charges of corruption and misrule . 
Leghari sat on the stage with Jiang , while caretaker Prime Minister Meraj Khalid and his cabinet occupied front-row seats where Bhutto and her colleagues once sat . 
Bhutto inaugurated the renovated hall , damaged in a mysterious 1993 fire , just one day before her dismissal . 
Jiang is due to visit Lahore , capital of the populous province of Punjab , on Tuesday and leave on Wednesday for Nepal , the third and last stop on his South Asian tour .
