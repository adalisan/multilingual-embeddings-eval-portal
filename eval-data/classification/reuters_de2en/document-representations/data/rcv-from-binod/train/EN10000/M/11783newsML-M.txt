plains feedlot cattle markets were at a standstill early Friday , and expected to remain quiet well into next week following this week &apos;s record-setting large sales volume , feedlot sources said . 
packers reportedly were well supplied with live inventory for next week and will not be looking to buy cattle again until Wednesday or Thursday , the sources said . 
most of this week &apos;s showlist was sold , but those cattle remaining were being priced at $ 70.00 per cwt . 
no packer bids were reported , but if they surface , they will be steady with this week &apos;s top price of $ 68.00 , they said . 
trades next week also could be influenced by the outcome of Friday &apos;s USDA cattle on feed report , market sources said . 
the report is expected to show active placements during July , along with small on-feed supplies and slightly larger marketings , compared with a year ago . 
Feedlot cattle prices next week also could be dictated by wholesale boxed beef values . 
if they do not remain strong , it will be difficult to get $ 70.00 for cattle , the sources said .
