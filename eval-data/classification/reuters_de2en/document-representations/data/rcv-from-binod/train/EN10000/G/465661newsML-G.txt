Sudan rebels said on Tuesday they had seized the southern army garrison town of Kajo-Keji and now controlled Sudan &apos;s borders with Zaire and Uganda . 
aid workers , who declined to be identified , confirmed Kajo-Keji &apos;s seizure by rebels but said they had no details . 
a spokesman for the Sudan People &apos;s Liberation Army ( SPLA ) said Kajo-Keji , besieged since March 9 , fell on Monday morning when rebels in &quot; Operation thunderbolt &quot; defeated a brigade of Sudanese troops . 
SPLA spokesman Yassin Arman said Sudan &apos;s borders with Uganda and Zaire were now under the control of the SPLA , which is led by John Garang and launched a southern offensive this month . 
&quot; The whole Ugandan-Zaire border is in our hands , &quot; Arman said . 
government forces were withdrawing toward Juba pursued by SPLA units , he added . 
he said the SPLA was less than 48 km ( 30 miles ) from the southern capital of Juba . 
Sudan President Lieutenant-General Omar Hassan al-Bashir told the international Arabic newspaper al-Hayat the Sudanese army had contained the rebel offensives and now had the initiative . 
the president said in an interview published on Tuesday that opposition leaders in exile could come home and even become ministers as long as they stopped cooperating with what he called &quot; the enemies of Islam &quot; . 
Sudan has accused Uganda , Ethiopia and Eritrea of sending troops to fight alongside the SPLA in its campaign in the south and the east since January . 
the town is about 15 km ( 10 miles ) north of the border with Uganda , which like Ethiopia and Eritrea have denied the charges from Khartoum . 
Arman said the only remaining government army garrison between the rebels advancing from the south and Juba was the Bongo Mountain garrison . 
the rebels have vowed to seize Juba . 
Arman said during the last three days there had been a heavy influx of Sudanese refugees from Uganda , returning to rebel-held areas of the south after a series of rebel advances this month . 
he said more than 80,000 Sudanese refugees had returned from Uganda in the last two or three days , walking across the border . 
the head of the U.N. refugee agency in Asmara , Arnulv Torbjornsen , said refugees had been arriving for two weeks in southern Sudan from Uganda . 
he said he did not think there were as many as 80,000 but there were considerable numbers . 
the SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy or independence for the Christian and animist south from the Moslem and Arabised north . 
it and its allies say they want a popular uprising in Khartoum against the Islamist government . 
the SPLA says in its offensive in the south it has killed about 3,000 government troops and militiamen and wounded or captured 1,000 . 
it admits several hundred of its own men were killed .
