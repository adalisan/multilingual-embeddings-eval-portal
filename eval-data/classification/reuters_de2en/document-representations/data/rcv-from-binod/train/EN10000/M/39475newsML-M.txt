oil product prices in Asia jumped last week as American missiles reined down on Iraq , and traders said they expected most of the gains to hold . 
the missile attack by the United States saw most product prices shoot up by about $ 2.00 per barrel , and they since have only fallen about $ 1.00 despite an easing in Middle East tensions . 
Asian refiners , who process more than 15 million barrels of oil each day , were given a much needed boost by the higher product prices and saw profit margins move back into the black . 
&quot; The market was ready to be pushed up , and when the attack took place it skyrocketted , &quot; one oil trader said . 
but now oil traders said that buying ahead of the peak-demand fourth quarter and strong world crude prices were likely to keep petroleum product prices firm for several weeks . 
diesel , heavily used to fuel vehicles and farm equipment , was assessed at $ 27.20 per barrel on Friday , only just below the week &apos;s peak of $ 27.60 seen on Tuesday after news of the first missile attack on Iraq . 
crude oil and petroleum product prices often rise during times of tension , especially in the Middle East , for fear that oil supplies will be interrupted . 
the Middle East has 65 percent of the world &apos;s oil reserves , and if its supplies were cut off it would cause a major shortage . 
the United States fired 44 missiles on Iraq during Tuesday and Wednesday in retaliation for Iraq &apos;s incursion into the northern Kurdish region , and the attack prompted fears of severe supply disrutpions . 
other Asian oil products mirrored the rise in diesel prices . 
Naphtha , a petrochemical feedstock , rose to a post Gulf War high at $ 21.50 per barrel , before easing to about $ 21.00 . 
jet / kerosene , used to fuel airlines and as a heating oil , rose to about $ 31.00 per barrel -- the highest level since January -- but fell to $ 29.10 by the end of the week . 
fuel oil , used by electricity generators and shipping , jumped to $ 114.50 per tonne before falling by the end of the week to $ 113.00 . 
&quot; A lot of people were under the perception that the market was hyped up , and when Iraq did not respond to the U.S. attack , people sold their positions , &quot; one trader said . 
traders said prices may have seen their peak for the time being , but they are nevertheless expected to remain strong heading into the fourth quarter . 
&quot; The winter demand for heating oil and kerosene should put a floor to any big price fall , &quot; one refiner said . 
crude prices are expected to stay strong . 
the United Nations has put on hold an oil-for-food accord with Iraq . 
the deal would have let Iraq return to the world oil market for the first time since the Gulf War . 
benchmark North Sea Brent hit a post Gulf War high of $ 23.50 per barrel after the first missile salvo on Tuesday , and by Friday &apos;s close had only slipped to $ 22.54 . 
the energy hungry United States is suffering from low stocks of kerosene and gasoline . 
Europe is low on stocks of kerosene also , while gas oil futures traded in London are bubbling around five-year price highs . 
the price movements in crude and oil products have eased pressure on refiners in Asia , who make profits by being able to buy crude at a cheap price and sell the products they produce at a higher price . 
the refiners &apos; profit margins were in the red for most of July and August , forcing producers in Singapore -- a major export centre -- to cut production to improve economics . 
but this week , oil giants Anglo / Dutch Shell and Mobil of the U.S. said they were back to full production of 420,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) and 280,000 bpd .
