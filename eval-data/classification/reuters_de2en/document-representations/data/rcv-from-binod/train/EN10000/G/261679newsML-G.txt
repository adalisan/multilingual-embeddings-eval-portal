Kofi Annan , the U.N. secretary-general designate , said on Tuesday he favoured adding Japan , Germany and other countries to the Security Council &apos;s five permanent members . 
hours before he was due to be formally appointed as U.N. secretary-general by the General Assembly , Annan told Radio France Internationale ( RFI ) it was the right moment to press Washington on payment of its arrears to the world body . 
&quot; But Japan and Germany cannot join alone . 
other countries must join with them . 
the question is how many , which and when . 
this is in the hands of member states . 
at present the five permanent Council members are the United States , Russia , China , Britain and France . 
he added he would press for membership of countries from Africa , Asia , Latin America and other regions . 
Annan said he hoped to persuade President Bill Clinton &apos;s administration to pay the United States &apos; $ 1.3 billion arrears , the lack of which has nearly bankrupted the world body . 
&quot; I think we would succeed if we put enough effort into this , &quot; he said . 
he said there had been a plan for Washington to pay up over five years . 
&quot; But since ( the Americans ) are preparing next year &apos;s budget , it is the right moment to get a commitment on that matter , &quot; he said . 
he has already said he would speak to Congress if that was what it took to persuade legislators to pay up . 
Annan , the head of U.N. peacekeeping , also said he favoured the creation of regional multinational forces . 
&quot; Regional organisations have a role to play , and multinational forces are often necessary as they can deploy troops more rapidly than the United Nations can , &quot; he said . 
he later told French TF1 television it was &quot; a great pity &quot; that the multinational force agreed by the U.N. to help refugees in eastern Zaire had not been deployed . 
he said the force &apos;s chief , Canadian Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril , had told him the force was cancelled because it had not received much support and the return home of most refugees left the soldiers without any role . 
about 600,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees were forced by the fighting in eastern Zaire to return last month to the country they fled in 1994 . 
some 130,000 more refugees , based in Tanzania , had also been obliged to trek back into Rwanda . 
Canadian units making up the force started packing up at the weekend after the U.N. ordered them to pull out . 
Annan gave the interviews in French . 
Paris , which wanted a French-speaker to succeed French-educated Boutros Boutros-Ghali , initially opposed the Ghanaian . 
in the end France withdrew its objections , mainly because Annan was the clear favourite among the candidates . 
France was angered by the U.S. veto of Boutros-Ghali and opposition to nominees from French-speaking African countries .
