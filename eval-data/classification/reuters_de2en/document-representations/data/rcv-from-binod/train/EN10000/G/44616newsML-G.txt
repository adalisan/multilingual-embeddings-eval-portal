firefighters gained ground Monday on a major Montana wildfire that has destroyed 34 homes , and residents of one hard-hit subdivision were able to return to their property to assess the damage . 
the Shepard Mountain fire , burning in the Custer National Forest of southern Montana , flared up last week , leaving a trail of 34 destroyed summer homes . 
the lightning-sparked fire , which was burning about 20 miles west of the town of Red Lodge , had consumed an estimated 12,800 acres , little changed from Sunday . 
fire officials at the scene reported steady progress by crews battling the blaze . 
firefighters said the fire was at least half-contained and was expected to be fully contained by Thursday night . 
&quot; weather conditions are all favourable , &quot; fire information officer Ladd Coates said . 
about 70 residents of one subdivision ravaged by the blaze were allowed to return to their property earlier Monday to evaluate damage , fire officials said . 
other evacuees have already returned to their property . 
in Wyoming , firefighters were battling a 2,880-acre fire in the Big Horn National Forest in the northern part of the state . 
the fire was 25 percent contained and was no longer threatening summer cabins in the area . 
the National Interagency Fire Centre , based in Boise , Idaho , said that five major fires were still burning in the West . 
the fires , in Montana , Oregon and Wyoming , were active on over 45,000 acres , the fire centre said . 
just over 3,250 firefighters were battling the fires . 
&quot; While the last few days of slower fire activity has allowed us to rotate and rest many of our firefighters , we continue to maintain a high state of readiness in case new fire outbreaks occur , &quot; Les Rosenkrance , director of the fire centre , said . 
&quot; Our reports indicate that most parts of the West -- in particular , California , Nevada and much of Oregon -- face a moderate to severe fire threat for the next month , &quot; he added . 
the Western United States has been experiencing its worst fire season in 30 years , with fires spreading quickly in parched grass , brush and forest . 
about 5.8 million acres have burned so far this year , compared with a five-year annual average of 2.1 million acres . 
at the peak of the fire season in late August , more than 22,000 people were battling 52 major fires in eight Western states .
