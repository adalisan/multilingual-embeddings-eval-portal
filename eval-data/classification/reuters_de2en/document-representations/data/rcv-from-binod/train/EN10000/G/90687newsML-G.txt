Parliament appealed to the Bulgarian people to stay calm after the killing on Wednesday of former prime minister Andrei Lukanov and said the act would not lead to a state of emergency . 
meanwhile armed police shut major roads linking the Bulgarian capital with frontier checkpoints , witnesses said . 
the murder scene was also cordoned off and the victim &apos;s remains taken away for forensic examination . 
his unidentified attackers had shot him twice in the head , neighbours said . 
in a joint resolution all parliamentary groups and independent deputies condemned &quot; categorically &quot; the murder of Lukanov , a deputy of the ruling Socialist Party which is composed of ex-communists . 
&quot; We appeal to all Bulgarian citizens to keep calm and together with us guarantee the constitutional order , &quot; said the resolution , read in the chamber by speaker Blagovest Sendov . 
&quot; We will not allow this terrorist act to lead to declaring a state of emergency in Bulgaria , &quot; the resolution said . 
&quot; The presidential election , set by the National Assembly ( parliament ) , will take place on 27 October 1996 , &quot; it added . 
Sendov called a day of mourning for Friday . 
Lukanov , millionaire businessman and parliamentarian for the ruling Socialists , was found shot dead at his home , Sendov told the house at the opening of its session . 
he said the circumstances of Lukanov &apos;s death were still not clear . 
the interior ministry and police have so far declined to give any details of the shooting . 
State radio said the type of firearm was not known but it might have been fitted with a silencer because neighbours had not heard any noise . 
it added the probable time of the killing was 9.20-9.30 local time ( 0720-0730 GMT ) . 
the area where 58-year-old Lukanov lived in Sofia was surrounded by police . 
neighbours told Reuters he was shot twice in the head while leaving his house . 
police removed the body for a forensic examination , the radio said , adding that Russia &apos;s ambassador to Sofia , Alexander Avdeev , arrived at the scene and talked to investigators . 
national Security Service chief Dimitar Vladimirov told journalists that Lukanov had been under his unit &apos;s protection from February until April following a specific threat . 
the protection ended after an &quot; investigation clarified the case , &quot; he said . 
Socialist parliamentarian Georgi Parvanov , one of the party leaders , insisted : &quot; This is a political killing and will undoubtedly throw a shadow over the ( presidential ) election . 
another former prime minister Filip Dimitrov , a deputy for the biggest anti-communist opposition Union of Democratic Forces , described the killing as &quot; a blow to democracy &quot; . 
State radio quoted President Zhelyu Zhelev as condemning the murder . 
the sophisticated , silver-haired Lukanov was widely seen as a powerful man in Bulgaria although he held no official post in the present government . 
earlier this year he criticised the Socialist Party for reviving the functions of the Stalinist state and restoring ties with the secret services . 
Lukanov was one of the architects of the downfall of Zhivkov in 1989 . 
he had been a Politbureau member and held a series of senior posts during the communist regime . 
he served as communist prime minister for six months in 1990 but resigned due to widespread public dissatisfaction with the sluggish pace of reform . 
under his rule , Bulgaria declared a moratorium on $ 12 billion of foreign debt . 
in 1992 the public prosecutor launched an inquiry into whether Lukanov misappropriated funds in the 1980s when he was deputy prime minister . 
he was stripped of parliamentary rights and detained for six months until the case was dropped . 
born in Moscow , Lukanov graduated from the Moscow institute for international relations . 
he was fluent in several languages and had close contacts with business circles in Russia .
