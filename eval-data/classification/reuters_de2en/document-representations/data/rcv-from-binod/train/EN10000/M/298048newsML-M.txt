the Bank of Thailand on Thursday said it would float an additional three billion baht ( $ 120 million ) of bonds to absorb rising liquidity in the Thai money market this week . 
the central bank said it raised a targetted amount of its 28-day bonds scheduled for weekly auction on Friday to five billion baht from two billion . 
&quot; We want to see more stable interbank rates in the market and this is a move to absorb some of the liquidity which should not be so high , &quot; a central bank official told Reuters . 
the overnight interbank rate fell sharply in the past few days after staying mostly in double digits for several months . 
brokers said the lower short-term interest rate helped fuel this week &apos;s strong rise in Thai stocks . 
the overnight rate eased to 8.75-9.25 percent late on Wednesday from 14.50-14.75 in late December . 
dealers said the rate rose slightly to 9.25-9.75 percent on Thursday morning but expected it to ease later on high baht liquidity . 
the central bank has been cautious about letting heavy inflows of foreign funds into the local money market , saying it could hamper government efforts to slow a sharp rise in short-term foreign debt borrowed by the private sector last year . 
the central bank official said the Financial Institutions Development Fund run by the bank would also auction out a separate three billion baht , three-year bond on Friday and another two billion baht , two-year bond on January 24 . 
brokers on Thursday said stocks also advanced on reports that the government was setting aside between 20 and 70 billion baht ( $ 800 million to $ 2.8 billion ) of funds to help pull the ailing Thai property sector out of a three-year slump .
