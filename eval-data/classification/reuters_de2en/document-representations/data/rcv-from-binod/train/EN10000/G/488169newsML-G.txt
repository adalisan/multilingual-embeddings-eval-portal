British firms would appoint Labour Party leader Tony Blair as chief executive rather than either the current Conservative Prime Minister John Major , or Liberal Democrat head Paddy Ashdown , a survey said on Monday . 
recruitment specialists Reed Personel Services asked 597 organisations across the UK to decide which of the three main party leaders would make the best chief executive officer . 
forty percent chose Blair , who is expected take over as prime minister after the May 1 general election , while 36 percent went for Major and 14 percent plumped for Ashdown . 
ten percent of those surveyed declined to state a preference or were undecided while two companies said they would choose the leader of the Monster Raving Loony Party , Screaming Lord Sutch , in preference to any of the main political leaders . 
Blair picked up most votes in the retail , distribution and wholesale , service , public , and charity sectors whilst Major took the honours in manufacturing where he garnered 46 percent of votes against Blair &apos;s 28 percent .
