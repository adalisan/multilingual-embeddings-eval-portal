a proposal by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to meet U.S. and Palestinian leaders for intense Camp David-style peace talks received a cool respone not just from Palestinians but also by inside his own party . 
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat convened his weekly cabinet meeting in self-ruled Gaza late on Friday and participants said they discussed the peace process but took no decisions on how to revive frozen contacts with Israel . 
&quot; The leadership studied ways and proposals to help get out of the present crisis , &quot; said PLO executive committee member Ghassan Shaka who attended the cabinet meeting . 
peace talks between the sides have been stalled since Israel began work on a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem last month . 
the Palestinians are enraged Israel is creating facts on the ground in an area slated for future negotiations . 
Palestinians have clashed with Israeli troops in the West Bank for 16 days over what Israel calls the Har Homa settlement . 
the pine-covered hill is known to Arabs as Jabal Abu Ghneim . 
Netanyahu , heading for a crisis meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton at the White House on Monday , proposed on Friday that the two sides try to resolve their conflict in the mode of 1978 Camp David talks at the presidential retreat near Washington that produced a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt . 
Arafat spokesman Nabil Abu Rdeineh did not reject the idea but insisted Israel first had to stop the settlement . 
&quot; They ( the Israelis ) have to stop building the settlement in East Jerusalem and the Americans have to guarantee Israel is committed to the signed agreements , &quot; he said . 
Members of Netanyahu &apos;s own Likud party hinted the prime minister may not have thought the idea through and recalled that former Israeli leader Menachem Begin and Egypt &apos;s Anwar Sadat had agreed on the outline of their 1979 accord before meeting at Camp David . 
&quot; When Begin went to sign the peace with Egypt he had at his side people who helped him ... smart people with experience who knew how to lead a strategy , &quot; said Likud &apos;s Tel Aviv Meyor Ronnie Milo on Israel television . 
&quot; Today the prime minister is going , without much experience himself , taking with him people of little experience . 
as a member of his party I advise the prime minister to consult people with experience and ability . 
Minister of Infrastructure Ariel Sharon said : &quot; I don &apos;t think in Israel &apos;s situation one person can take all the decisions . 
opposition Labour member Ephraim Sneh , a candidate for the party &apos;s leadership , wondered where Netanyahyu &apos;s policy was leading . 
&quot; If he built at Har Homa today I have a reasonable fear he is moving towards busting the negotiations and not advancing them , &quot; he told Israel Radio . 
in Tel Aviv an Israeli army spokesman denied reports from Lebanon that Israeli helicopters had fired rockets on suspected Hizbollah targets in the Syrian-policed Bekaa valley . 
&quot; There was no air force attack in Lebanon , &quot; the spokesman said .
