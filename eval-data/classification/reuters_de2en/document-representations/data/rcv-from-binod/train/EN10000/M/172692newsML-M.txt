* Central Bank buys dollars when rate hits 26.238 pesos to dollar 
the Philippine peso closed slightly higher at 26.244 to the dollar on Thursday despite aggressive Central Bank dollar-buying , traders said . 
the peso closed at 26.249 on Wednesday . 
&quot; The Central Bank was back in the driver &apos;s seat . 
it started bottom-fishing for dollars when the rate hit 26.238 pesos to the dollar , &quot; one trader said . 
the Central Bank bought about $ 70 million between 26.239 and 26.245 to the dollar . 
total turnover reached $ 146.8 million . 
&quot; Banks were more than willing to sell their dollars to the Central Bank , &quot; another trader said , adding that most banks would try to buy back the dollars on Friday , taking advantage of an arbitrage opportunity . 
dollars bought on a Friday will be settled on Monday . 
in the meantime , the buyers will still hold on to their pesos which earn higher interest rates during the weekend . 
another trader said some banks were shorting their dollar positions in favour of high domestic interest rate . 
oil companies , which were the regular buyers of dollars in the market , bought around $ 30 million at 26.242 to the dollar . 
the parallel rate was hovering about three centavos higher than the official market rate due to higher demand from commercial clients who do not have necessary import bills to buy dollars from the banking system . 
the weighted average was unchanged at 26.243 to the dollar . 
traders expected the peso to remain close to the Central Bank &apos;s buying and selling rates .
