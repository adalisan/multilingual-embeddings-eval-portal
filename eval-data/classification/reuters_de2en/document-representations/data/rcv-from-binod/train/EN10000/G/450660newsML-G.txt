the European Parliament will refuse to take delivery of its costly new Brussels headquarters until a row over the new building &apos;s underground car park is resolved , parliament officials said on Tuesday . 
the European Union assembly was due to move into the 40 million Belgian franc ( $ 1.2 billion ) building on April 1 , but it has now decided to sit tight unless it is given the 2,300 parking spaces which developers Societe Forum Leopold ( SEL ) originally promised . 
&quot; There was a decision not to take over the building unless the conditions in the contract were met , &quot; parliament spokesman Stig Berglind told Reuters . 
SEL can only provide parliament with 900 parking spaces under a ruling by the regional environment ministry , which aims to ease traffic jams and cut pollution in the city . 
SEL director Jacques Bellemans said he hoped the regional government would this week overrule Brussels Environment Minister Didier Gosuin and let the original contract stand . 
last month Gosuin challenged the parliament to state clearly before the end of March , when it is due to sign a 27-year lease on the new building , whether it needed all 2,300 parking places . 
Berglind told Reuters the assembly currently needed room for only 1,500 cars but had catered for nearly twice that number in line with EU plans to expand from 15 to 25 members early next century . 
pollution and traffic chaos would be even worse than at present if civil servants had to vie with locals for the few spaces near their offices where parking was legal , he said . 
the only dissenting voices among parliament &apos;s 626 deputies have come from the 28-member Green group , which thinks the assembly should abide by the wishes of local people to cut car use , in return for a reduction in the price of the new building . 
&quot; Creating parking spaces encourages more cars , &quot; Magda Alvoet , the Belgian co-president of the Green group argued . 
Parliament should concentrate on improving public transport services , Alvoet said .
