copper &apos;s price slide from six-month highs hit last month accelerated this week and more volatility is expected as the market seeks direction after the shockwaves from the Sumitomo scandal earlier this year . 
copper now stands at around $ 2,100 per tonne , having crashed from a high for the year of some $ 2,700 in May to a low of $ 1,745 in June after Sumitomo Corp uncovered billions of dollars in losses . 
in its latest gyration it shed $ 200 after a rally , which took it to its highest since June , fizzled out in late November . 
&quot; I think you &apos;d have to expect more volatility ... There &apos;s no indication that it won &apos;t flare up again , &quot; said analyst Robin Bahr of broker Brandeis . 
prices lurched lower on Monday , breaking through a $ 2,100 floor , but popped up early on Tuesday when the latest rise in London Metal Exchange warehouse inventories was less than expected . 
&quot; That surprises me . 
I would have thought as we approach the holiday shutdown there would be less consumer interest , &quot; said Bahr . 
&quot; But there is still metal moving out of warehouses by the thousands ( of tonnes ) . 
that would indicate demand is still good . 
LME copper stocks have edged up to 115,375 tonnes , up slightly from a 6-1 / 4 year low hit in late November , but still under half the 275,775 tonnes in September . 
analysts had predicted a surge in new mine production would burden the market with a large surplus this year , but Bahr , for example , is having to revise his view to show the market was in balance in 1996 . 
many investors , however , remain wary of the metal after Sumitomo fired head copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka in June . 
the Japanese giant blames him for running up $ 2.6 billion in losses from unauthorised trading , but denies suggestions he manipulated the market to artificially boost prices .
