Lyubov Yegorova &apos;s Russian team mates said they were surprised and disappointed after she admitted taking the banned drug Bromantan before a gold-medal performance at the Nordic skiing world championships . 
Alexander Grishun , head coach of the Russian women &apos;s team , said on Thursday Yegorova , six times an Olympic champion and three times a world champion , was finished in the sport and had no chance of being picked for next year &apos;s Nagano Olympics . 
&quot; I fear that she &apos;ll have to accept she is finished with the Olympics and with skiing in general , &quot; he said . 
top Russian skiing administrator Viktor Mamatov added : &quot; I &apos;m very sorry this case has cast a shadow not only over Yegorova but on the winning performances of her team mates . 
the 30-year-old former world champion &apos;s admission was a big embarrassment for Russian sports so soon after controversy over the use of the same substance by some Russian athletes at last year &apos;s Atlanta Olympics . 
Yelena Vialbe , awarded the gold after coming second to her Russian team mate in Sunday &apos;s 5-km classic cross-country race , said Yegorova &apos;s disqualification had spoiled her own triumphs , including two other golds this week . 
&quot; After what happened with Bromantan in Atlanta she should have known not to take those pills . 
it &apos;s very unpleasant . 
the entire Russian team demanded that Yegorova leave the Trondheim championships in Norway immediately , said the vice-president of the Russian Ski Federation , Boris Bystrov . 
Yegorova claimed ignorance caused her to take the pills . 
she told Russia &apos;s Sport Express newspaper she had reached &quot; automatically &quot; for an old pack of Bromantan she had had since she won three golds at the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics . 
&quot; I didn &apos;t understand the substance was banned , &quot; she said , explaining she had been in hospital during the Atlanta games . 
&quot; You &apos;d have to be suicidal to take Bromantan knowing it was banned , &quot; Yegorova added . 
it &apos;s a nightmare to get caught for such a trifle .
