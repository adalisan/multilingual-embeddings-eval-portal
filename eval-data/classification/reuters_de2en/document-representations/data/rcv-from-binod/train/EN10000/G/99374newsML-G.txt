the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) said on Monday it was helping enable the hospital in the east Zairean town of Uvira to treat victims of armed conflict , following an upsurge in fighting in the area . 
the deputy head of the ICRC delegation in Zaire , Didier Bregnard , told Reuters by telephone from the area that they were building up the surgical capacity of the hospital , which did not even have a surgeon . 
&quot; We have increased aid because there has been an increase in fighting at Uvira , &quot; he said . 
Zaire accused Rwanda last month of sending infiltrators into the area and spoke of clashes between its forces and armed bands of Banyamulenge or ethnic Tutsis , some of whom have lived in eastern Zaire for generations . 
human rights groups have denounced the incidents , accusing Zairean troops of targeting and expelling Banyamulenge civilians unconnected with any armed bands . 
&quot; Uvira has no surgical structure . 
there is no surgeon in their hospital . 
our project is to equip the local health centre to cater for victims of armed conflict , &quot; Bregnard said . 
&quot; A team of five people , notably anaesthetists arrives in Zaire this week , &quot; he said , adding that the Belgian Red Cross would send staff to deal with routine medical care . 
he said that the ICRC would also boost medical structures in North and South Kivu , which are host to more than one million Hutus who fled Rwanda in 1994 fearing reprisals after Hutu hardliners massacred hundreds of thousands of Tutsis . 
State radio said earlier that Zaire &apos;s armed forces chief of staff , General Eluki Monga , had gone to the refugee town of Bukavu on Sunday to start an inspection tour of the area . 
&quot; He is accompanied by a number of high-ranking army officers so he can take stock of the situation there , &quot; it added . 
an advisor to the governor of South Kivu province declined to comment on the situation , other than to express surprise at talk of a resurgence in fighting .
