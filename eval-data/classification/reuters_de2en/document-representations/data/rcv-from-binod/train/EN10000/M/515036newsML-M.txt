upward momentum in cocoa futures was seen waning and could mean further gains would be difficult , technical analysts said on Wednesday . 
&quot; It &apos;s not going up nearly as fast as it came down , so you have to say that it &apos;s not going to meet resistance from the peak area , &quot; ( near 1,050 stg per tonne in May ) said Susan Rigg at Chart Analysis . 
cocoa has closed firmer in the past few days , but volume has remained low to moderate . 
may Cocoa was expected to open three to five stg lower from Tuesday &apos;s close . 
on Tuesday , cocoa left a gap at the open between 1,013 and 1,018 and closed strongly at its session high of 1,025 stg , which some traders saw as constructive . 
however , Rigg noted that recent trading around current levels has been ragged . 
&quot; It &apos;ll have to get well above there ( 1,050 ) and close above it to be convincing , &quot; she said , adding that she did not expect cocoa to rise to the task . 
&quot; There &apos;s an awful lot of supply from the beginning of this year . 
I would have said it &apos;s going to have to do a lot of work and probably , it &apos;s going to drift lower during the course of that . 
may support rests at 1,002 , the low on Friday and Monday . 
further support was seen near 974 and 962 .
