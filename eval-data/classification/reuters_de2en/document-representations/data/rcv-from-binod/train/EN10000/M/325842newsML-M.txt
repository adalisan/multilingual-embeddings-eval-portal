the European Union ( EU ) is expected to award up to 90,000 tonnes of current series white sugar at its weekly tender later on Wednesday , traders said . 
but it remained unclear which Paris futures contract the Commission would use as a basis to calculate its maximum restitution level , which would in turn affect the tonnage awarded , they said . 
&quot; There &apos;s been a big debate -- I think a lot of participants will be keen to get licences because there &apos;s no point in waiting , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; The dollar exchange rate is very favourable this morning and people are somehow expecting the market to bounce , &quot; he said , forecasting a tonnage range of between 60,000 and 90,000 tonnes . 
the EU &apos;s maximum restitution was expected at 46.198 Ecus ( European currency units ) based on the May contract , he added . 
if the March contract was used , then the maximum level would be 46.281 Ecus . 
in its last tender on January 15 , the EU awarded 47,250 tonnes at maximum rebate of 46.302 Ecus . 
but another trader said the spot March contract was a more likely basis for the calculation as it closed at a $ 1.00 discount to May . 
&quot; My feeling is that it will be the March because nobody is going to have much interest in putting in ( for licences ) against the May , especially if it &apos;s trading at a premium , &quot; he said . 
he forecast a range of between 40,000 and 50,000 tonnes for the award , similar to last week . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think there &apos;s that high a demand for licences , &quot; he said .
