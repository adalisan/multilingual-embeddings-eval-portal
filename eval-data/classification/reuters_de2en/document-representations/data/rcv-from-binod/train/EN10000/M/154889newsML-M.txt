the precious metals were hovering just above key price support levels on Wednesday after recent sharp losses and dealers said they threaten to break lower . 
&quot; We &apos;re getting to critical levels , &quot; a London-based dealer said . 
&quot; If the pressure stays on gold it &apos;ll head down to $ 375 and if silver breaks through support we &apos;ll get a sell-off . 
gold fixed at $ 380.30 an ounce , compared to $ 381.70 on Tuesday afternoon and a London close of $ 381.30 / $ 381.80 . 
prices were holding just above the key $ 380 an ounce support level after tumbling in a New York-led sell-off on Tuesday afternoon . 
&quot; Gold as an entity is not looking too well . 
there has been some quality selling -- not just speculative -- that &apos;s pushed the price down , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; Whether it &apos;s from producer or central banks we &apos;ve yet to see , &quot; he added . 
unconfirmed rumours of further European central bank selling of gold reserves , as European Union countries seek to meet the 1999 single-currency criteria , has been depressing market sentiment , dealers said . 
and recent U.S. economic news easing some fears of inflation and a U.S. interest rate hike have left the market vulnerable to speculative selling , some analysts said . 
business was mostly quiet , but further weakness may attract more speculative interest , dealers said . 
&quot; If we see more weakness we might see the funds coming on board , &quot; one said . 
silver was holding just above its $ 4.80 support level after crumbling nearly 10 cents on Tuesday afternoon . 
it was indicated at $ 4.81 / $ 4.83 and ounce . 
its fate may depend on gold &apos;s ability to hang on above support , analysts said . 
&quot; If gold can stabilise then there are better chances for silver to go up again , &quot; said analyst HansPeter Hausheer of Swiss Bank Corp in Zurich . 
&quot; The fundamentals for silver are not that bad . 
&quot; platinum was trawling the very bottom of its recent $ 380- $ 390 price range , fixing at a fresh near-three year low of $ 380.50 an ounce . 
palladium was also weak and close to support levels at $ 115.25 / $ 116.25 an ounce , although it was up about $ 0.75 from lows hit at Tuesday &apos;s London close . 
platinum and palladium have been sliding lower in recent months under pressure from ample supply from key producer Russia and slack demand from the key Japanese electronics industry .
