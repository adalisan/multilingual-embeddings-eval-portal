Argentina &apos;s Central Bank did not announce its international reserve levels Friday , the fourth day in a row no figures have been announced . 
a source at the bank said that computer problems meant they could not distribute the figures -- usually announced daily with a 48-hour delay -- but that they should be released Monday . 
the last report on reserves was issued last Monday , when the bank reported it had $ 18.32 billion in reserves by September 26 , of which $ 2.66 billion , or 14.28 percent , were in securities .
