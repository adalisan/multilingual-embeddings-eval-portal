the European Union has still failed to attract a single bid for special maize exports to four former Eastern Bloc countries , in the face of competition mainly from Hungary , EU grain industry officials said on Friday . 
EU member states voted on Thursday to raise a fixed refund for the exports to 25 Ecus per tonne from 20 Ecus per tonne . 
but by week &apos;s close , no bids had been received , they said . 
the refund covers maize exports to Slovenia , Slovakia , Czech Republic and Poland . 
&quot; There is strong cometition from Hungary . 
there have been no bids at all , &quot; one industry official said . 
so far the EU has only received and accepted bids for 5,000 tonnes of maize exports to Switzerland and Liechtenstein . 
refunds for all six countries are being treated under one quantity ceiling , which was originally set at 75,000 tonnes . 
so 70,000 tonnes of maize remains available that can be shared between the Alpine countries and the four eastern Europe states , the officials said . 
the standing refund for maize exports to all other non-EU countries has been classified as a &quot; dash , &quot; signifying &quot; nil value . 
&quot; Unlike a refund which merely stands at zero , this kind of refund cannot be prefixed and monthly storage aid increments do not apply . 
standing refunds are allocated on a first-come , first-served basis through the EU &apos;s daily &quot; common right &quot; restitution system , rather than at the weekly export tender held each Thursday . 
the maize refund for eastern Europe was originally introduced on March 13 at a level of 15 Ecus per tonne . 
under EU rules traders must display contracts to qualify for the aid .
