the Bulgarian Lev fell to 254-255 per dollar at the close from 252-253 in early interbank trade despite central bank support because foreign currency demand topped supply throughout the day , dealers said . 
the central bank sold dollars to large final clients between 252.50 levs in the morning to 254 in the afternoon to relieve some of the pressure on the Lev , dealers said . 
Central bank officials declined comment . 
&quot; A persistent foreign currency demand from smaller final clients and banks pressured the Lev , especially in the afternoon when dollar supply ( to the market ) was almost nil , &quot; a commercial bank dealer said . 
uncertainty over implications of a currency board system , currently under consideration for Bulgaria , also prevented banks from actively offering foreign currency , traders said . 
an International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) mission currently in Sofia is in talks with Bulgarian politicians and bankers on introducing a currency board as a way to restore confidence in the battered Lev and help defeat hyperinflation . 
under the currency board system , the national currency would be pegged to a major currency and the amount of national currency in circulation must be matched by the central bank &apos;s foreign exchange reserves .
