lira Eurobonds were the focus of the primary market on Wednesday , reflecting the rally in Italian debt markets amid optimism over EMU . 
the BTP / Bund spread tightened to a new low of 107 basis points -- a months ago the spread was at 135 b.p. 
bankers said demand for lira Eurobonds was boosted by increased expectations that Italy would adopt the single European currency on January 1 , 1999 . 
&quot; The currency is very strong at the moment and there are a lot of investors putting convergence trades on , &quot; a syndicate manager at Bear Stearns said . 
L-Bank launched a 500 billion lire bond , fungible with existing March 2004 bonds in marks and French francs after they are redenominated into euros . 
an official at joint lead manager said the deal has gone extremely well , and J.P. Morgan placed around half its paper outside Italy . 
demand for longer-dated lira Eurobonds has been buoyed by the expectation that Italy would not auction 10-year BTPs , the J.P. Morgan official said . 
&quot; L-Bank , as well as the KfW 10-year bond launched today , are being bought as substitute for BTPs , &quot; he said . 
the L-Bank parallel allows convergence plays because all tranches have the same coupon and maturity . 
&quot; It is a typical deal for convergence plays , &quot; J.P. Morgan said . 
Brazil was also active in the market , adding 250 billion lire to a 20-year bond . 
bankers said the bonds were aimed at yield-hungry domestic Italian investors . 
in marks , Mexico issued a 750 million mark 11-year bond which paid an eight percent coupon and was priced at par . 
the yield on the July 2007 Bund was around 5.65 percent . 
&quot; Mexico has done a lot of mark bonds and the name is very accepted so we have seen good demand from a lot of retail accounts in Germany and emerging market funds , &quot; an official at lead manager Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said .
