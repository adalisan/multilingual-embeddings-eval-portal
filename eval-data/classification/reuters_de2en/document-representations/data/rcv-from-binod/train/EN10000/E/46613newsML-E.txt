acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Wednesday the United States has enjoyed an increase of key exports , including agriculture , from its participation in the World Trade Organization . 
&quot; The WTO agreement only entered into force on January 1 , 1995 , but we are already seeing impressive growth in sectors that are critical to the U.S. economy and sectors where we fought hard to open markets , &quot; Barshefsky said in prepared testimony to the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee . 
the panel was holding a hearing on the WTO and the ministerial conference to be held in Singapore in December . 
Barshefsky said U.S. agricultural exports to WTO members grew by 28 percent in 1995 and continued to grow at a healthy pace in the first half of 1996 . 
&quot; Countries that heretofore banned imports of U.S. products , such as rice and apples , were required to open their markets , &quot; she said . 
&quot; We &apos;re making sure the Committee on Agriculture is viewed by all WTO members as a forum where detailed scrutiny is given to each and every country &apos;s progress in adhering to commitments on domestic support , import performance under tariff rate quotas and export subsidies , &quot; Barshefsky added . 
she said that in 1995 U.S. exports of paper to WTO members grew by more than 40 percent , construction equipment by nearly 30 percent , and chemicals and agricultural equipment by more than 25 percent . 
U.S. trade policies and participation in the World Trade Organization could become a target of Reform Party presidential candidate Ross Perot , who chose anti-free-trade econmist Pat Choate as a running mate . 
Choate has strongly criticized U.S. participation in the WTO as well as the North American Free Trade Agreement .
