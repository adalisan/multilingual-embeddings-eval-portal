Vietnam , almost 22 years to the day after the fall of Saigon , on Friday lauded confirmation of the first U.S. ambassador to Hanoi as a great step in the process of laying to rest the ghosts of war . 
within hours of Douglas &quot; Pete &quot; Peterson &apos;s confirmation by the U.S. Senate , officials in the Vietnamese capital gave their first formal comment on an appointment seen by many as long-overdue and mired for months in political controversy . 
&quot; I think this is a great step , another big step in the process of normalisation of relations between our two countries , &quot; said Peterson &apos;s Vietnamese counterpart , Le Van Bang , Hanoi &apos;s ambassador-designate to Washington . 
&quot; It should be considered as an impetus for better relations in many other fields . 
Peterson &apos;s confirmation , following a brief Senate debate on Thursday , had been held up for months -- first by a legal technicality and then by charges that Hanoi &apos;s efforts to account for Americans missing in action in Vietnam were inadequate . 
but news of the decision brought an instant and positive response , uniting the views of Hanoi &apos;s small American community with apparatchiks in the government offices of the city centre &apos;s Ba Dinh square . 
&quot; Through this event we can confirm that now the majority of American people and ( the ) government in general agree to build up a new kind of relationship with Vietnam . 
&quot; said Nguyen Xuan Phong , director of the Americas department at the foreign affairs ministry . 
&quot; Of course we are pleased . 
U.S. business executives were similarly enthusiastic . 
&quot; It &apos;s a small victory for us ( the U.S. business community ) , &quot; said Bradley Lalonde of the American Chamber of Commerce . 
&quot; He embodies Vietnam &apos;s attitude towards the struggles of the past and looking towards the future . 
he &apos;ll be well liked . 
Peterson &apos;s appointment amounts to a psychological landmark in relations between Hanoi and Washington , which a generation after the Vietnam war ended -- in the chaos of April 30 , 1975 -- remain fraught with emotion . 
the two countries normalised diplomatic ties two years ago , but progress since then towards any kind of normality in the relationship has been painstakingly slow . 
while analysts focus on quantifiable measurements , such as the absence of a trade accord , commercial air links and other aspects of a nascent economic relationship , diplomats on both sides concede the real work lies in confidence-building . 
an indication of the differences emerged earlier this week when U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , the most senior economic official to visit Vietnam since the end of the war , was castigated , albeit indirectly , by Vietnam &apos;s leaders for the slow progress in relations . 
for ordinary people , on the streets of this northern capital , reaction on Friday to the news of Peterson &apos;s appointment was more down to earth . 
&quot; He was a pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam . 
it &apos;s very good that he &apos;s coming back , &quot; said a 40-year-old policeman . 
&quot; Pete Peterson ? 
does he work for a bank ? 
&quot; said a young woman .
