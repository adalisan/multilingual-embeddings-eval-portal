the overnight interbank rate was bidded up on Monday by commercial banks seeking fresh funds , dealers said . 
they said a lack of lenders also boosted the overnight rate . 
&quot; Commercial banks were paying up to 9.0 percent but there were no lenders , &quot; said a dealer at a Malaysian bank . 
no confirmation was available as Bank Negara does not comment on its money market operations . 
the overnight traded between 6.0 and 8.0 percent on Friday on lending by foreign banks , which have excess funds . 
&quot; Foreign banks are choosy over which banks they are lending to and this is causing the uneven spread of funds , &quot; one dealer said . 
foreign banks had overborrowed in the market after being caught short when the central bank last month sold large amounts of the dollar for the ringgit to stem the Malaysian currency &apos;s slide against the dollar . 
earlier , interbank rates were lower across the board after heavy lending of one-month money over the past week . 
&quot; There has been a heavy lending of one-month money . 
I &apos;m not sure if it was Bank Negara &apos;s intervention or the big banks themselves were lending , &quot; said another Malaysian bank dealer . 
dealers said with maturity of Bank Negara bills worth 1.5 billion ringgit this week expected to improve liquidity further , interbank rates were likely to fall back to levels they were at a month ago . 
one- , two- and three-week money were at 7.50 / 80 percent against 8.00 / 20 percent on Friday . 
one-month money was at 7.80 / 90 percent from 8.20 / 30 , and three-month was also at 7.80 / 90 percent against 8.00 / 10 . 
interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were generally higher as the cash interbank rates eased . 
at 0900 GMT , the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank offered Rate ( KLIBOR ) June contract was up seven points to 92.13 , or an implied yield of 7.87 percent . 
the September contract rose six to 92.51 , or 7.49 percent , and December was up eight to 92.62 , or 7.38 percent .
