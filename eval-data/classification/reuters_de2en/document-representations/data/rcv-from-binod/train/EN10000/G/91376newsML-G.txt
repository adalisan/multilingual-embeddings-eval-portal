voters in Ohio prefer Elizabeth Dole to Hillary Rodham Clinton , according to a poll released Wednesday . 
&quot; First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has fallen into disfavour with Ohio voters , &quot; the University of Cincinnati said in a statement . 
&quot; By contrast , Elizabeth Dole is well thought of although she remains unknown to a large portion of Ohio voters , &quot; it said . 
university political scientists Alfred Tuchfarber , Andrew Smith and Eric Rademacher said opinions of the candidates &apos; wives were unlikely to have a substantial election impact . 
the Ohio poll was conducted in early September by the university . 
sponsored by the Cincinnati Enquirer newspaper and WLWT-TV , it included telephone interviews with 627 likely voters statewide and had a plus or minus 3.9 percent margin of error . 
the survey indicated that 38 percent of those polled had a favourable opinion of the first lady vs. 45 percent with an unfavourable opinion , probably due to Whitewater allegations , investigations into Arkansas investments and Mrs. Clinton &apos;s role in the president &apos;s failed health care reform proposals , the pollsters said . 
others had no opinion . 
in contrast , just 9 percent of those polled had an unfavourable opinion of Elizabeth Dole , while 45 percent said they viewed her favourably and others had no opinion . 
Democrats and liberals were most likely to have a favourable image of Mrs. Clinton , while Republicans , conservatives , members of the religious right and residents of the conservative Cincinnati area were most likely to view her unfavourably . 
Mrs. Dole &apos;s rating was highest among Republicans and Cincinnati-Dayton area residents and lowest among Democrats and African-American voters , the pollsters said .
