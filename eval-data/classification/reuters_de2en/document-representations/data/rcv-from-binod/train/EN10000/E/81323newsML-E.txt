facing a heavy debt repayment schedule over the next couple of years , Mexico will be juggling a number of pressing demands for its cash , experts say . 
with obligations to the U.S. Treasury , the International Monetary Fund and other organizations , and market debt coming due , Mexico will have to refinance or renegotiate a large amount of debt in the next few years . 
on top of that are efforts by the federal government to buy back Brady bonds , an effort that some economists say could continue . 
&quot; They ( the federal government ) have debt falling due . 
they have obligations to pay back . 
they would like to pay back money to the U.S. government and the IMF as quickly as possible to get rid of that liability , &quot; said ING Barings economist Arturo Porzecanski . 
&quot; I really think that their priority will be to repay the U.S. Treasury and the IMF in an anticipated manner , &quot; he said . 
Santander Investment estimates that public sector and central bank debt amortizations in 1997 will total $ 9.88 billion , and $ 13.65 billion in 1998 , before rising to $ 15.27 billion in 1999 , then falling to $ 10.69 billion in 2000 . 
much of that debt , however , is owed to the IMF or other multilateral organizations , which the Mexican government believes it can pay back from international reserves , from financing in international debt markets or by trying to negotiate an extension of what it owes to the IMF . 
&quot; We are not overly concerned . 
a large portion of that debt is non-market , &quot; said Santander Investment economist hector Chavez . 
&quot; The refinancing strategy to date has been adequate , but obviously with 1997 coming and additional payments the government has to think about using favourable international conditions to meet its obligations , &quot; Chavez said . 
Santander estimates that Mexico &apos;s market debt service from 1997 to 2000 will be $ 15.0 billion , while non-market , such as to the IMF , the U.S. Treasury , and other organizations , will be about $ 35.0 billion . 
Mexico &apos;s recent debt placements have been for the most part warmly received in markets . 
it bought back a nominal $ 1.24 billion worth of discount Brady bonds , replacing them with proceeds from a $ 1.0 billion 20-year issue earlier this month . 
that followed an earlier placement in May of a $ 1.75 billion 30-year bond in another Brady bond swap . 
but it has also been using money from debt placement to repay the U.S. and the IMF money they lent during the peso crisis in 1995 . 
in July , Mexico placed $ 6.0 billion of floating-rate bank notes and used collateral freed in the 30-year bond swap and some other operations to pay back $ 7.0 billion owed to the U.S. Treasury . 
the Mexican government also paid back the IMF $ 1.0 billion with proceeds from the placement of a $ 920 million Samurai bond issue in June . 
as well as paying back more of what it owes to the IMF , Mexico could also try to buy back more of its outstanding Brady bonds , aiming to tighten the spread on its debt and lessen the high servicing costs of the repayments it will have to make over the next two years , economists said . 
the discount Brady bonds , besides tieing up collateral , may also soon have to pay a premium depending on the price of oil , for their so-called value recovery rights . 
&quot; For the collateral that is tied up , the spread is too wide and so they are going to buy them back as much as possible and get the spread down , &quot; said Lehman Brothers senior economist Darryl McLeod . 
&quot; It ( buying the Bradies back ) lowers the cost of borrowing for the money that they are going to need to borrow to pay back to the IMF , and to the Treasury , &quot; added McLeod . 
sentiment on Mexico has improved since the economic crash . 
standard &amp; Poor &apos;s , for example , recently raised the outlook on Mexico to stable from negative .
