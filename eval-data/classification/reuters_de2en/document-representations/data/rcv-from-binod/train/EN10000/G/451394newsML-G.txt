the South Pacific kingdom of Tonga was reverberating to the sound of hammers and chainsaws on Tuesday as people began repairing damage from Cyclone Hina . 
the cyclone on Sunday night tore roofs from houses , felled trees and power lines and ravaged crops but there were no human casualties . 
power was restored to the central business district of the capital , Nuku &apos;alofa , on Tuesday but it was expected to take more than a month to restore it to villages and outlying areas . 
the storm which gusted at over 80 knots snapped most concrete power poles off at their base . 
part of the roof of the wooden parliament building was blown off . 
a disaster relief committee met for much of Tuesday but was yet to make its report . 
its work was hampered by the collapse of the airport hangar at Nuku &apos;alofa airport onto the Tonga Defence Forces &apos; only plane , purchased for disaster surveillance work . 
another major casualty was the Teufaiva Stadium , the main sports ground , which was recently constructed with the assistance of foreign aid . 
its roof blew off , briefly trapping the caretaker and his U.S.-born wife , Rachael Tufunga . 
Tufunga said she had experienced the Los Angeles earthquake in 1994 but Cyclone Hina was more terrifying . 
&quot; The California earthquake only lasted for four seconds but this went on for half an hour , &quot; she said . 
radio was restored on Tuesday with programmes clogged with advertisements of cut price sales as shops attempted to sell off discounted frozen goods affected by the power cuts . 
people fearful of food shortages were stocking up on tinned produce . 
cyclone Hina passed within about 30 km ( 19 miles ) of the capital . 
Nuku &apos;alofa is on the main island , Tongatapu , which is home to about half of Tonga &apos;s 100,000 people . 
the cyclone was the latest of several to sweep through the South Pacific . 
last week Cyclone Gavin left 10 people dead and 17 missing in Fiji , while Cylone Justin killed six people in southeast Papua New Guinea and 21 people were reported missing .
