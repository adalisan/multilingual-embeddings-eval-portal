&quot; It &apos;s a reflection of the numbers , &quot; said one trader , referring to a weekly supply survey by the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) . 
crude oil on hand in U.S. refineries jumped 6.4 million barrels last week , prompting a sell-off in early after-hours trade , players said . 
but the decline was soon stopped at $ 20.28 a barrel , only six cent below the settle . 
&quot; People looked at the breakdown , and saw most of the build was in PADD 5 ( West Coast ) , &quot; the trader said . 
PADD 5 supply numbers , which accounted for 5.04 million barrels of the build , are dismissed as suspect because much of it resides on ships . 
about 1,858 lots traded overall and 1,048 in the front month . 
nationwide drawdowns of 335,000 barrels for gasoline and 2.58 million barrels for distillate came despite an increase in refinery runs , leaving industry observers confused . 
NYMEX May heating oil trimmed 0.05 cents from the market close of 53.95 , with amid total volume at 251 lots , traders said . 
gasoline was sold at 62.90 cents , a 0.23 rise , but traders said thin volume allowed speculator to inflate the market , trading only one lot at the overnight high of 63.40 cents . 
volume stood at 144 lots overall and 126 in May .
