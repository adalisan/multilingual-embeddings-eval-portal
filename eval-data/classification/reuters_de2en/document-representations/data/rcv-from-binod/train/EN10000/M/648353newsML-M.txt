previous Forecast Resistance Support 
* ringgit bound to range on selling pressure from funds 
* weak dollar / majors have little impact 
* Strong dollar buy orders seen at 2.5090 
the ringgit was in a range , but expected to ease slightly on sustained selling pressure from overseas funds , dealers said on Monday . 
they said the selling in the thin market was exaggerating the impact on the ringgit , despite weak dollar / majors . 
that is why dollar / ringgit is not going down , even though dollar / majors are softer , &quot; said a dealer with a European bank in Singapore . 
he said there was demand for dollars at 2.5090 level . 
dealers said the upside for dollar / ringgit would be limited at 2.5140 / 50 level on demand for ringgit from Malaysia . 
&quot; The market is very quiet . 
very little volume is going through , probably because it is holiday in Sydney , &quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank .
