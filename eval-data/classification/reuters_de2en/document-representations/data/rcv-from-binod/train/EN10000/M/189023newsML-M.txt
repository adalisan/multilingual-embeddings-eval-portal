Malaysian rubber prices closed slightly lower with further weakness in Tokyo rubber futures weighing on local prices , dealers said . 
&quot; Prices were marked down in line with the drop in Japanese prices , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; But the situation is still the same . 
sellers were not really keen to sell while buyers were not willing to pay up . 
Australia was seen in the market asking offers for 100-200 tonnes of SMR 20 for January / February arrival , but dealers did not hear of any business been transacted . 
dealers said sellers did not want to commit themselves to forward sales given the uncertain weather conditions and approaching year-end holidays which would affect their stocks . 
they added that the return of buyers would be the only factor that can boost the market . 
at the close , December RSS1 buyer was quoted at 318 cents ( $ 1.26 ) a kg by the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board , down one cent from Wednesday . 
December SMR 20 buyer was down half cent at 310 cents ( $ 1.23 ) a kg .
