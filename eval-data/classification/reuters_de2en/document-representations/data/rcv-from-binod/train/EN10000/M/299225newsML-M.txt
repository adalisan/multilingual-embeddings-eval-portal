the dollar rose sharply against European currencies Friday -- hitting its highest level in about 2-1 / 2 years against the German mark and the Swiss franc -- on news of surprisingly strong domestic job growth . 
but the dollar fell against the yen on worries that Japanese banks would be forced to sell foreign assets to raise cash after Tokyo stocks tumbled again Friday . 
the Labour Department said the economy created 262,000 jobs in December , far exceeding forecasts on Wall Street . 
dealers initially hesitated to buy dollars when stocks and bonds fell sharply after the jobs report . 
investors worried that the latest sign of economic strength could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates , which would hurt corporate earnings and stock and bond prices . 
although bonds fell sharply , stocks rebounded , with the Dow Jones industrial average adding 78.12 points to 6,703.79 , its fourth record this week , helping to propel the dollar higher . 
&quot; There was talk early in the day of U.S. interest rates going up and the crash in treasuries hurt the dollar . 
but as stocks made a strong recovery , the dollar came back up , &quot; said David Ogg , foreign exchange manager at Dresdner Bank . 
the dollar rose to 1.5865 marks , the highest level since August 1994 , compared with 1.5765 late on Thursday . 
the dollar climbed to 1.3758 Swiss francs , the highest since May 1994 , from 1.3695 on Thursday . 
the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1-3 / 16 , boosting its yield to 6.85 percent from 6.75 percent on Thursday . 
the dollar fell in early trading in Tokyo as the Nikkei average of 225 stocks lost 770.22 points , or 4.3 percent , to 17,303.65 , the lowest close since August 1995 . 
Japanese stocks have fallen more than 15 percent in the past month . 
while declines in Tokyo stocks boosted the dollar earlier this week , the latest drop convinced investors that Japan &apos;s banks would be forced to sell foreign assets , including dollars , to meet capital requirements back home . 
the dollar fell as low as 115.25 yen in early trading before rebounding to 116.07 late in New York , down from 116.37 late on Thursday . 
&quot; Some heavy fund selling helped push the dollar down against the yen on the back of talk of capital repatriation by the Japanese , &quot; Ogg said . 
but that selling appeared to come mostly from non-Japanese entities , and experts at Japanese firms said the concerns were exaggerated . 
&quot; American investment banks and other foreign bank dealers are thinking the Japanese should sell their foreign assets . 
but actually , the Japanese investors have not been doing that recently , &quot; said Tadatoshi Taso , chief foreign exchange dealer at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi . 
the British pound fell sharply to $ 1.6815 from $ 1.6987 . 
dealers cited a report showing Britain &apos;s manufacturing sector shrank 0.5 percent in November for the pound &apos;s decline .
