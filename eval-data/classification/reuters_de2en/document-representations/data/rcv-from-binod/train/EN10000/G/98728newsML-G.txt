the United States asked Sweden on Sunday to help gather information about North Korea &apos;s allegations they had arrested an American for spying , White House spokesman Mike McCurry said . 
&quot; We are aware of the reports , &quot; McCurry told Reuters shortly before President Bill Clinton left for Hartford , Connecticut . 
&quot; The charge ( d &apos;affaires ) of the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang is making inquiries on behalf of the United States on the status of this individual , &quot; he added . 
the Swedish charge d &apos;affaires represents U.S. interests in Pyongyang , which has no diplomatic relations with the United States . 
earlier in the day the official Korean Central News Agency ( KCNA ) said Evan Carl Hunzike was arrested on Aug . 24 inside North Korea after he crossed the Amnok River . 
KCNA did not say why it took more than a month to announce the arrest and did not provide further details of the man , other than to say he worked for South Korean intelligence . 
a spokesman at the U.S. embassy in Seoul said earlier : &quot; We &apos;re trying to determine if he &apos;s a U.S. citizen . 
a spokesman for South Korea &apos;s Agency for National Security Planning said : &quot; We &apos;ve never heard of the name . 
the allegation was made up by the North .
