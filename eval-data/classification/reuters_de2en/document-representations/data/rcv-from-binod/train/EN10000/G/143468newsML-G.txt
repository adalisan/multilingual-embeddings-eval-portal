China &apos;s defence minister saw no possible cause for confrontation with the Philippines , state media said on Friday , despite a simmering sovereignty dispute over the Spratly islands in the South China Sea . 
&quot; China and the Philippines have countless reasons to strengthen exchange and cooperation and have not a single reason to trigger off confrontation , &quot; the official Liberation Army Daily quoted Defence Minister Chi Haotian as saying . 
Beijing and Manila were good neighbours , Chi told visiting Philippine armed forces chief General Arturo Enrile . 
a source familiar with Enrile &apos;s visit said the long-standing territorial dispute over the Spratly islands had not been raised during his meeting with Chi . 
Enrile , the first Philippine chief of staff to visit China , was returning a visit to Manila last month by Chinese general chief of staff fu Quanyou . 
fu &apos;s visit was seen by Manila as a chance to help solve outstanding disputes with Beijing , which include rival claims to parts of the Spratly islands . 
Sino-Philippine relations soured last year when Manila accused the Chinese of building what looked like naval support installations on mischief Reef in a contested portion of the potentially resource-rich island group . 
Beijing , which claims all the Spratlys , said the structures were shelters for fishermen and has refused to withdraw from the area . 
China would not practise expansion or power politics even after it became much stronger economically , the official Xinhua news agency quoted Chi as telling Enrile . 
&quot; China has stationed not even one soldier overseas and China &apos;s national defence policy is entirely defensive . 
in any sense , the so-called &apos; China threat &apos; is just totally groundless , &quot; he was quoted as saying .
