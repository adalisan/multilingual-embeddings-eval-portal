Western Province edged to victory over Northern Transvaal on the final day of their Supersport Series match at Newlands on Monday . 
the defending champions survived the scare of a last wicket partnership of 43 to clinch victory by 39 runs when they bowled out Northerns for 226 . 
the game had looked all but over after bursts of three wickets in 27 balls and , an hour later , three in 12 balls had left Northerns deep in trouble at 122 for seven . 
but a 50-run partnership between Steve Elworthy ( 34 ) and Ivan Pistorius ( 32 not out ) gave them a scent of an unlikely victory . 
Rudi Bryson went cheaply but number 11 Greg Smith hung around for an hour in scoring 23 to begin to cause Province concern . 
wastefully for Northerns he was finally dismissed when he was run out on the verdict of the third umpire while attempting a third run . 
earlier Province added 57 to their overnight 342 for six to set a target of 265 for victory in a minimum of 87 overs .
