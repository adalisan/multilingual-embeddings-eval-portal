President Alberto Fujimori said on Sunday he did not foresee a quick end to Peru &apos;s 103-day hostage crisis but insisted progress has been made to resolve peacefully the siege at the Japanese ambassador &apos;s home . 
&quot; There was a lot of speculation during Holy Week that there would be a peaceful solution but we were conscious that we were not in the final stage , that the conditions were not right , &quot; Fujimori said . 
&quot; Naturally , we are hopeful that it will be the soonest possible , but we do not glimpse a date &quot; for an accord with the guerrillas holding 72 hostages , he said . 
his comments in a television interview further dampened speculation that face-to-face talks between the government and Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) rebels expected on Monday or Tuesday would lead to a break in Latin America &apos;s longest hostage crisis . 
a tired-looking Fujimori told local TV channel frecuencia Latina that a three-man guarantors commission mediating in the crisis would continue &quot; preparing the ground &quot; for a meeting between the rebels and government negotiator Domingo Palermo , but he did not say when that meeting would occur . 
the two sides last met on March 12 . 
Fujimori sounded more optimistic than either Japan &apos;s Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto or rebel leader Nestor Cerpa , who made clear on Saturday the MRTA was insisting on its demand for the freeing of jailed comrades . 
&quot; We still don &apos;t foresee a peaceful solution soon , &quot; Cerpa said by walkie-talkie from the residence . 
&quot; The positions are still not really drawing close . 
he denied speculation that the MRTA had opened the way for a deal by accepting a Cuban offer of political asylum . 
it was a gloomy Easter Sunday for the hostages , who have also spent Christmas and New Year &apos;s in captivity . 
they held a mass and got chocolate Easter eggs and fresh fruit with their usual daily supply of meals and refreshments . 
they also received a visit by the guarantors commission formed by Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani , Canadian Ambassador Anthony Vincent and Red Cross representative Michel Minnig . 
in the television interview , Fujimori repeated his refusal to free jailed MRTA members . 
&quot; The framework we are in ... is to not accept the release of any prisoner , &quot; he said , but he said a special committee would continue to study pardons for Peruvians unjustly jailed on terrorism or treason charges for alleged ties to Peru &apos;s two leftist rebel groups . 
recommendations by a special panel formed before the MRTA stormed the Japanese residence on Dec . 17 led to about 100 pardons . 
Fujimori said the committee would recommend more pardons but he insisted the hostage crisis &quot; has nothing to do with the liberation of those unjustly condemned . 
he also said his government was working to improve jail conditions , another main concern of rebels who say their comrades are condemned to slow deaths in virtual &quot; tombs . 
among the hostages are the ambassadors of Japan and Bolivia , Fujimori &apos;s brother Pedro , two cabinet ministers , military officers and Japanese businessmen and diplomats .
