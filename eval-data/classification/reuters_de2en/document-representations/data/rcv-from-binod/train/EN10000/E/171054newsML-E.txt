the Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) said on Wednesday it was cutting official interest rates by half a percentage point to 6.5 percent , declaring that lower inflation provided scope for faster economic growth . 
the cut , which had been long anticipated , brought rates down to their lowest level since December 1994 when the central bank had been tightening aggressively to pre-empt higher inflation . 
&quot; It &apos;s a reward for low inflation and wage restraint , &quot; Prime Minister John Howard told reporters . 
Howard said the rate cut would help job creation and boost the Australian economy . 
&quot; It will encourage people to take more risks to invest , to have a go and all of that helps , &quot; Howard said . 
the rate cut was the second this year , after the central bank reduced rates from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent on July 31 , citing continuing high unemployment . 
Australia &apos;s four big commercial banks took the hint on Wednesday and quickly slashed their variable mortgage rates by the full 0.5 point , bringing the standard rate down to 8.75 percent . 
in a statement accompanying the cut , the RBA said the decison had been taken at its monthly board meeting on Tuesday . 
&quot; This decision was taken by the board yesterday in view of the improvement in the outlook for inflation , which has increased the scope for the economy to sustain a faster rate of growth , &quot; the bank said . 
the bank said inflation had returned to its target range of two to three percent , adding that a firm exchange rate had helped ease inflationary pressures . 
underlying inflation slowed to 2.4 percent in the third quarter from 3.1 percent in the three months to June . 
economists welcomed the easing , saying it was fully justified by the country &apos;s favourable inflation performance and should ensure economic growth picked up as expected in 1997 . 
&quot; The fact the cut was not as large as some in the market had been tipping suggests the RBA is not that worried about the economic outlook , &quot; said Ivan Colhoun , an associate director at bain &amp; Co , the Australian arm of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
&quot; We think the economic data over the next month or so will be soft enough to make the market look for another easing , but it will depend crucially how inflation and wages perform and that will not be clear until February , &quot; he said . 
financial markets took the move in their stride and were already busy assessing the chances of a third easing this year . 
futures dealers clearly savoured the prospect and took the March 90-bank bill contract -- which most closely reflects market thinking on where cash rates will be -- to an implied rate of 6.21 percent . 
the 10-year Commonwealth bond yield had long priced in today &apos;s cut and dipped only slightly to 7.25 percent from 7.28 . 
the Australian dollar actually bounced on relief the easing had not been larger , touching 79 U.S. cents from an early US $ 0.7865 . 
in contrast , the widely expected rate cut failed to excit Australian share investors , with the All Ordinaries index closing a point lower at 2,360.6 .
