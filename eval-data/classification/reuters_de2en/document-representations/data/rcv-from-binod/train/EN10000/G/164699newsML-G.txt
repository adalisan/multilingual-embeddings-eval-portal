the French military says mounting a humanitarian operation to save refugees in eastern Zaire is feasible , but Paris first wants a clear international mandate . 
foreign Minister Herve de Charette urged the United States , European and African countries on Monday to hold urgent talks on how to restore security in eastern Zaire and help avert disaster for more than one million refugees fleeing fighting . 
Paris has not said outright it was ready to send forces to Zaire , which would involve fleets of chartered transport planes - but there is a recent precedent . 
&quot; We single-handedly and successfully carried out a similar operation in Rwanda in 1994 to end ethnic killings and allow aid to be brought to populations in danger of starvation and epidemic , &quot; a senior officer told Reuters on Monday . 
a move into neighbouring Zaire would be even easier than the Rwanda rescue since troops from several countries would presumably be involved , he said . 
most aid agencies have pulled out of east Zaire , where they were helping about a million mostly Rwandan Hutu refugees trapped by fighting between the Zairean army and ethnic Tutsi rebels backed by the Tutsi-led Rwandan army . 
officials said the French government was waiting to see whether African heads of state , due to discuss the Zaire fighting at a meeting in Nairobi on Tuesday , would call for action by the European Union . 
France is still smarting from charges from African countries and some of its own European allies that its Rwanda intervention was mostly aimed at advancing French policy objectives . 
the officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said the only problem in mounting a Zaire rescue operation was &quot; our usual lack of heavy lift capacity . 
&quot; I presume we would again have to charter giant Antonov transports from Ukraine , &quot; he said . 
the officer said that under &quot; normal &quot; circumstances , the Europeans could count on help from the U.S. Air Force &apos;s huge transport fleet which already rushed French paratroopers to Zaire in the past when its government was threatened by Cuban-trained rebels . 
&quot; But until the U.S. presidential election is over , there is little chance we will see the Americans move . 
perhaps if things have been dragging along , it is precisely because the American administration is paralysed as it always is during elections when no one wants to take the risk of getting involved abroad , &quot; he said . 
de Charette said a possible international operation would only be temporary and would allow refugees to return to their camps and villagers to return home . 
the French officer who described details of the possible operation said that , as in Rwanda two years ago , a Zaire operation would probably aim to set up &quot; safe haven &quot; areas where refugees could safely gather for food and medical treatment . 
such areas and &quot; humanitarian corridors &quot; leading to them , would have to be kept clear of the various armed forces now pitted against one another in the region and who preyed on civilians for political , ethnic or monetary reasons , he said . 
problems could come from the Zairean regular army , whose forces in the area he dismissed as without military value , or from Hutu militias or Tutsi forces . 
&quot; In Rwanda , we had no more than 2,500 men on the ground and that was sufficient to discourage anyone from stealing food from refugees . 
I don &apos;t foresee any problems as long as we are strong and look strong , &quot; he said . 
France already has troops based in several African locations and can also draw on professional paratroop , Foreign Legion and Marine units based in France and used to operating in Africa . 
the well-informed daily Le Monde said at the weekend that the European Union was thinking of an operation which might involve French , Belgian and South African troops . 
Italy said on Saturday that &quot; suitable measures of protection &quot; were needed so the United Nations could aid refugees in eastern Zaire .
