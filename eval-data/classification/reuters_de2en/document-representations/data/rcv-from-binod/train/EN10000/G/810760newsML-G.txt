after two and a half days , prayers for a miracle were finally answered here early on Saturday when a muffled voice called from the depths of the rubble of a landslide . 
buried beneath big slabs of concrete , trapped in a black pocket of space almost 10 metres into the rubble , despondent rescuers found what even they had begun to feel was beyond their reach -- signs of life . 
after three nights of freezing temperatures , when the mercury dived as low as minus-12 degrees Celsius ( about 10 degrees Fahrenheit ) , a man &apos;s voice called to rescuers , sending a shudder of excitement and disbelief through the exhausted rescue party . 
&quot; A miracle has occurred , &quot; a triumpant police Chief superintendent Charlie Sanderson told reporters . 
a thumb raised in triumph was the only sign to onlookers , crowded on a hillside facing the landslide , that the mood of depair gripping Australia &apos;s main winter playground had broken . 
suddenly , in the half-light of dawn in hand-numbing cold , about 100 rescuers sprang into action , feverishly trying to tunnel toward the man , working up to their neck in rubble so unstable that police held serious fears of another landslide . 
human chains formed to ferry buckets of dirt away from the tunnel , as rescuers inched their way toward the man , said by local media and people on the site to be local ski instructor Stuart diver , who told them he felt numb . 
police have declined to identify the man . 
a team of specialist ambulance officers stood by with a thermal blanket and appeared to be setting up an intravenous drip . 
among the debris that came to the surface were ironing boards , sheets , a pair of jeans and a microwave oven . 
sensors were fed into the rubble and detected muscle movement . 
the excitement was palpable . 
crowds of onlookers gathered , a look of anxiety replacing the stony expressions of the past days , since a landslide engulfed two ski lodges late on Wednesday night , entombing the 20 people believed to have been inside . 
&quot; It &apos;s fantastic , &quot; said Rebecca Thompson , a tourist from the west Australian city of Perth . 
she has been in Thredbo village , nestled in a valley of the snowy Mountains southwest of Sydney , for the past week and has seen the picturesque village become a ghost town . 
&quot; It &apos;s awful that we have lost lives , but they have got some fantastic workers out there . 
they never give up hope . 
&quot; It &apos;s pretty surreal . 
it &apos;s hard to believe you are watching it ( the rescue effort ) on the news and then seeing it out your kitchen window , &quot; she added . 
for the victims &apos; family and friends , who prayed for survivors inside Thredbo &apos;s small sunlit church on Friday just as police told them to expect the worst , it is still a nightmare . 
three bodies have been found and another 16 are missing .
