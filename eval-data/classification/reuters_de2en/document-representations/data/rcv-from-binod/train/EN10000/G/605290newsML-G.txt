Taiwan activists pledged on Thursday to mount a third mass protest to denounce President Lee Teng-hui &apos;s government , saying it had failed to heed calls to improve social order . 
officials criticised the plan , saying further protests were unnecessary because the government had clearly understood what the protesters wanted and would take action . 
more than 50,000 people marched on the Presidential Office on May 4 and again on May 18 to vent anger at investigators &apos; failure to solve a string of murders that have fuelled feelings that social order was declining . 
the marches have been seen by analysts as indications of a loss of public confidence in President Lee &apos;s Nationalist government . 
protest organiser Lee Tien-chien of the humanistic Education Foundation said the planned May 24 march would run through the night and voice &quot; utmost discontent &quot; with Lee &apos;s policies . 
&quot; We are totally disappointed with the government and no longer expect it to do anything , &quot; Lee Tien-chien said , adding that officials had turned a deaf ear to the earlier protests . 
&quot; Despite our demand , Lee Teng-hui failed to acknowledge his mistakes or immediately replace the premier , &quot; he added . 
government spokesman David Lee said further protests were a waste since Taiwan &apos;s leaders had heard the demonstrators &apos; message . 
David Lee said cabinet chief or Premier LIEN Chan had addressed many issues publicly . 
LIEN and his cabinet have faced criticism over numerous unsolved crimes , including the gangland-style execution of a county magistrate and seven associates in his home and the kidnap-murder of the daughter of a prominent actress . 
to reduce public discontent and help restore public confidence in government , LIEN offered to give up the premiership after constitutional reforms are adopted in July .
