a technical bounce plus talk China overnight bought 50,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans boosted CBOT soybean futures to a higher close , traders said . 
&quot; There is talk China bought 50,000 tonnes of beans for November shipment , &quot; said Ron Kucha of O &apos;Connor and Co . 
traders acknowledged the China talk but pointed to the very oversold status in the soybean complex as central to the gains . 
the nine day relative strength index ( RSI ) for November soybeans closed at 18.323 points , below the 20 level which generally is considered a very oversold area . 
&quot; It &apos;s just technical . 
we were due for a bounce , &quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds . 
gains were limited by technical selling near the $ 6.95 level , the traders said . 
&quot; It ( Nov ) couldn &apos;t penetrate the $ 6.95 area , yesterday &apos;s high and today &apos;s high , but we &apos;ll see what happens tomorrow , &quot; said Steve Bruce of E.D. 
and F. Man International . 
also gains were muted by active harvesting in the U.S. Midwest under near ideal weather conditions . 
soybeans closed two to five cents per bushel higher , with November up four at $ 6.92-1 / 2 . 
&quot; If the weather outlook is good they will probably beat it down again tomorrow , &quot; Bruce said . 
&quot; There is no reason for bulls to step up and buy . 
at best bulls will wait for the market to go sideways at best . 
the rally was trimmed by a light number in Tuesday &apos;s USDA weekly export inspections report . 
USDA said 10.480 million bushels of soybeans were inspected for export during the week ended October 10 , below the 15.5 million inspected the same week a year ago . 
the weekly tally was below trade expectations for 12 million to 16 million bushels . 
key players included Cargill Inc which bought three million bushels of November , The Chicago Corp which bought 2.5 million January and LIT America which bought two million bushels of January , traders said . 
soybean futures volume was estimated at 61,000 contracts , down from 79,271 Monday , according to the CBOT . 
in soybean options , Goldenberg Hehmeyer bought 500 November $ 6.75 puts at 1-1 / 2 cents , Continental grain bought 450 November $ 7.00 calls at 3-3 / 4 to four cents , E.D. 
and F. Man International bought 450 November $ 7.25 puts at 34 and Cargill investor Services bought 500 January $ 7.75 calls at 2-1 / 4 cents , traders said . 
soybean options volume was estimated at 38,000 , down from 50,559 Monday .
