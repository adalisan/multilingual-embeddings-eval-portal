Bulgaria &apos;s interim government decided on Thursday to issue a new 50,000-lev note by end-June , the government press centre said . 
&quot; The government approved today the design of a 50,000-lev note proposed by the central bank , which is to be put in circulation in the first half of this year , &quot; a statement said . 
soaring inflation made a new note necessary to ease large payments , the government said . 
the largest denomination in use so far is a 10,000-lev note , which was put into circulation on December 9 . 
the Lev has fallen from around 500 per dollar at the beginning of this year to around 2,050 on February 20 and traded at a record low of 3,200 on February 7 on the interbank forex market . 
official figures show monthly inflation for January 1 to 25 was 43.8 percent . 
experts from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences forecast it will near 100 percent in February . 
the new note depicts the brothers Cyril and Methodius who created the Cyrilic alphabet in the 9th century . 
initially the notes will be printed in Germany but printing will be transferred to Bulgaria in the second half of the year .
