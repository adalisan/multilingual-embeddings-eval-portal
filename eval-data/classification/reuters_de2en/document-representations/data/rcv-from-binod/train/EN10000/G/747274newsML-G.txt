the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR said on Tuesday thousands of Cambodians fleeing fighting in their country following the recent coup were reported massing near the border with Thailand . 
but the Thai authorities were not allowing them to cross and the UNHCR was not being allowed into the area , spokeswoman Pam O &apos;Toole told a news briefing . 
&quot; We are increasingly concerned about reports that thousands of people may be massing at Cambodia &apos;s border with Thailand and are not being allowed to cross , &quot; she said . 
the UNHCR was appealing to the Thai authorities to open the borders . 
up to 2,000 Cambodians had gathered at a western border point at Poipet seeking entry to Thailand , while there were reports that there could be more than 20,000 more massed near the northern border in an area called Chong Chom Pass . 
o &apos;Toole said relief organisations on the spot had reported these included members of military units who supported the FUNCINPEC party of ousted first prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and their families . 
in Bangkok , the Thai capital , she added , a growing number of refugees were arriving at the UNHCR office asking for help in obtaining asylum . 
many were members of FUNCINPEC or of another party called the Union of Cambodian Democrats , she said . 
these were alleging that many of their colleagues had been tortured or killed . 
Ranariddh , now in exile , has said that at least 30 senior officials loyal to him have been executed by forces of Cambodian strongman and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen.
