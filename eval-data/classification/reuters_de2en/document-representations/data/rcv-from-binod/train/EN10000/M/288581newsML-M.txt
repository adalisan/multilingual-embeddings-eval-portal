the Singapore oil products market started the week largely unchanged in very thin trading , although gas oil edged up slightly on prompt demand , traders said . 
a local trader bought 185,000-barrels of gas oil for loading end January at $ 32.10 per barrel free-on-board Singapore from a European major , 20 cents more than Friday &apos;s assessed level . 
traders said the market remained under some selling pressure for February cargoes as China has not made enquiries to buy February cargoes in a big way . 
it has covered all its large cargo requirements for arrival in January . 
bids from China for February gas oil was seen at around $ 247 per tonne cost-and-freight south China , traders said . 
a jet fuel offer at $ 32.50 per barrel for 100,000 barrels lifting in end January was matched by buying interest from a major but no deal was confirmed . 
Taiwan issued a tender to buy 32,000-tonnes of jet fuel for arrival in February 15-28 which closes on January 13 . 
both gasoline and naphtha were steady in lacklustre trade as the market made a sluggish return from holidays . 
most Singapore refiners have yet to move their February naphtha barrels and said it was too early to indicate levels . 
in comparison , sources said there were still gasoline supplies in January with very thin regional demand . 
Mideast cargoes were heading south to Australia as it did not make sense to bring them to Singapore , they said . 
the only fresh demand emerged from India for 25,000 tonnes of 87-octane leaded gasoline for delivery February 8-12 to Goa or Kandla on the west coast . 
the tender closes January 15 . 
a bid for 92-octane unleaded gasoline was raised by 10 cents to $ 26.00 per barrel , fob Singapore lifting January 22-25 but only faced an offer for 97-octane at $ 27.10 , lifting January 27-31 .
