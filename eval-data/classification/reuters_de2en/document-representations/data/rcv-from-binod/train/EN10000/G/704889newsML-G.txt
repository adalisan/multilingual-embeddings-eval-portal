more than 400 illegal immigrant children from China and their families jammed Hong Kong &apos;s immigration department on Thursday to press for residency rights in this newly handed-back Special Region . 
the children , whose parents are Hong Kong residents , were among hundreds of minors who crossed over earlier this year in hope of claiming a right of abode after Britain &apos;s handover to China . 
under Hong Kong &apos;s post-handover constitution , the Basic Law , effective on July 1 , children born to Hong Kong permanent residents are entitled to the same status . 
however , Hong Kong &apos;s new chief Tung Chee-hwa has said children who came in illegally without waiting for proper clearance procedures would be repatriated . 
chanting slogans and waving copies of the Basic Law , the protesting families said the government had no legal grounds to deport the children . 
&quot; I &apos;ve read the Basic Law , there &apos;s no doubt that my children can enjoy the right of abode immediately , &quot; said Wong Shui-ching whose wife and three children were smuggled into Hong Kong after years of separation . 
&quot; We &apos;re here to fight for justice , &quot; he said . 
after an hour &apos;s meeting with the protesters , the immigration department promised not to deport the illegal minors before their identity can be confirmed . 
the department will review about 1,000 cases in which children were served removal orders before June 30 , said assistant immigration director Mak Kwai-yun . 
an unknown number of other children are believed to be hiding in their homes and have not yet surrendered . 
&quot; We &apos;ll look into the cases again in accordance with the law which is now in force , &quot; said Mak . 
but he stressed that there would not be an amnesty for illegal immigrants . 
Tung told a news conference on Wednesday that a series of administrative measures would be introduced , backed up with legislation to stop unlawful migrants flooding in . 
the Hong Kong government wants an orderly immigration process from the mainland , fearing that a huge influx would cause a string of social and economic problems . 
but human rights activist Ho Hei-wah warned that any new laws aimed at repatriating these children could violate the Basic Law provisions . 
&quot; The government will certainly face legal challenges from us if they introduce such laws , &quot; Ho said . 
thousands of Hong Kong people have crossed the border to marry mainland Chinese over the years . 
it is estimated that 60,000 children from these &quot; separated families &quot; are waiting to settle in the territory . 
currently , 150 mainland people , including 66 children , are allowed to immigrate into Hong Kong daily . 
some families complain that they have been waiting for over 10 years as corrupt officials in China have delayed approving their applications and so they resorted to smuggling their children and wives into Hong Kong . 
according to Hong Kong police , more than 700 illegal minors were recorded in March , compared with 754 for all 1996 .
