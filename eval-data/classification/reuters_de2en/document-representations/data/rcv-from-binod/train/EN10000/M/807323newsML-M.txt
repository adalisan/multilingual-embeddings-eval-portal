the Philippine peso fell into new territory on Monday and could drop further with the central bank &apos;s decision to let it seek its own level , bankers and analysts said . 
the peso , buffeted by the region &apos;s currency turmoil , hit a record low of 30.14 to the dollar in morning trade , or 14 percent below its level of 26.40 before the central bank &apos;s effective devaluation on July 11 . 
volume was an active $ 70.5 million , although that is well below levels before the currency &apos;s slump last month when the central bank finally caved in to waves of speculative attacks on the currency that were eating up its reserves . 
&quot; It ( the peso ) will test further lows , &quot; a bank trader said . 
&quot; The central bank is not intervening at all . 
probably for them , letting the exchange rate go is the lesser evil than controlling it through interest rates , &quot; said Emma Pante , economist at Far East Bank . 
the central bank last month raised its closely watched overnight borrowing rate to a 2-1 / 2-year high of 32 percent in a futile defence of the peso which had fallen prey to attacks bedevilling Southeast Asia &apos;s currencies . 
it has since brought down its overnight borrowing rate to 14 percent to encourage banks to lend and prevent a possible recession caused by high interest rates . 
but the prolonged volatility in the region &apos;s currencies kept the peso on the defensive . 
&quot; By letting it ( the peso ) go , it will not go haywire for long . 
it will seek its own level , &quot; Pante said , adding the currency could trade at 30 / 30.5 before gaining again . 
&quot; This week you &apos;ll see it appreciating . 
&quot; There &apos;s a common strategy among the central banks in the region to let their currencies seek their own level , which should bring us closer to stability earlier , &quot; an analyst from a foreign brokerage house said . 
&quot; They ( the central bank ) don &apos;t have much choice ( in their intervention stance ) . 
they &apos;re already resigned to the fact there would be a lot more volatility before the peso seeks its own equilibrium level , &quot; said Banco Santander treasurer Antonio Agcaoili . 
but he said the extent of the speculation in the market had been regulated by the central bank through new regulations set out last month . 
these include the cutting of banks &apos; long dollar positions to five percent from 10 percent of capital , the raising of liquidity reserves and the slashing of over-the-counter dollar sales limit to $ 25,000 from $ 100,000 per individual . 
Bank traders said the central bank could still raise liquidity reserves to control the amount of liquidity that could be shifted to peso speculation . 
&quot; That &apos;s the central bank &apos;s prerogative . 
( but ) that could be counter-productive to their goal of lowering of interest rates , &quot; Agcaoili said .
