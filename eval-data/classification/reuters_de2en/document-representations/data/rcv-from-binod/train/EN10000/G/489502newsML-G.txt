AC Milan crashed to their biggest ever league defeat on Sunday when they lost 6-1 to arch-rivals Juventus in front of their own fans at the San Siro stadium . 
&quot; It was a real thrashing , &quot; acknowledged club president Silvio Berlusconi after one of the worst setbacks in his 11-year presidency . 
&quot; Perhaps nothing like this has ever happened in the red-and-black &apos;s history . 
Milan &apos;s previous heaviest losses in the Italian league were 5-1 at home to Genoa in the 1950s and 5-1 to fiorentina way back in the early 1930s . 
in an humiliating capitulation , the five-times European champions were three down after 50 minutes as Juventus scored twice through Vladimir Jugovic and once from a Zinedine Zidane penalty . 
Italians Christian Vieri and Nicola Amoruso had made it 5-0 before the home side finally got on the scoresheet through Marco Simone . 
Vieri then added a sixth for Juventus . 
the margin of defeat plunged Milan back into crisis after a run of four matches without conceding a goal . 
that run looked to have stopped the rot that had seen the club sack Uruguayan coach Oscar Washington Tabarez and crash out of the European Cup after losing to Norwegian outsiders Rosenborg Trondheim in the San Siro in December . 
&quot; It was one of those days when everything you do goes wrong , &quot; acknowledged current coach Arrigo Sacchi . 
&quot; An evening to forget in a hurry . 
but the fans may not let him forget . 
after the match they gathered under the director &apos;s box yelling &quot; sack him &quot; . 
Juventus coach Marcello Lippi admitted the margin of victory left his side closer than ever to a record 24th league title . 
&quot; We &apos;re even more convinced that we can win the championship , &quot; said Lippi , &quot; but I &apos;m sure that Parma don &apos;t think the race is over yet . 
the victory leaves Juventus six points clear of their nearest challengers Parma who had narrowed the gap to three points earlier on Sunday with an impressive 3-0 win over Sampdoria . 
the only blackmark on Juve &apos;s evening was a re-occurrence of Alen Boksic &apos;s leg injury that threatens to keep the Croat striker out of the European Cup semifinal against Ajax next Wednesday . 
there was little sign of the rout to come in the opening minutes which Milan dominated . 
but in the 14th minute Vieri gave warning of Juve &apos;s power , turning Paolo Maldini 30 metres out and unleashing a fierce shot that had Sebastiano Rossi scrambling across his goal . 
in the 19th minute , Vieri again demonstrated why he is rated as Italy &apos;s best young striker by setting up Juve &apos;s opener . 
the 23-year-old brushed off Franco Baresi &apos;s challenge before firing a snapshot that Rossi could only parry . 
the ball fell to Jugovic on the penalty spot who volleyed into the empty net . 
Milan kept their heads and were unlucky not to level when Cristophe Dugarry &apos;s header from the edge of penalty area looked like looping over Angelo Peruzzi until the Italian keeper somehow tipped the ball over . 
on the half-hour , however , luck delivered a cruel blow to the champions from which they never recovered . 
Jugovic &apos;s long-range effort was heading nowhere until it rebounded off two Milan defenders to fall at the feet of the unmarked Boksic . 
Maldini &apos;s desperate tackle only succeeded in tripping Boksic and Zidane converted the penalty . 
at half-time , Berlusconi praised his side claiming Juventus had taken the 2-0 lead from their only attacks of the match . 
within five minutes of the restart , however , Berlusconi watched in silence as Jugovic underlined the defensive frailities of Milan &apos;s ageing side by cutting in from the right flank virtually unopposed to beat Rossi at his near post . 
suddenly Milan &apos;s spring resurgence had been stemmed and the dark days that led to the dismissal of Tabarez were returning to haunt Sacchi . 
it was a measure of the coach &apos;s desperation that he put his personal differences with Roberto Baggio to one side and sent on the former Italy international from the bench . 
but it was too little , too late . 
in the 70th minute a Baggio header was again brilliantly saved at his near post by the inspired Peruzzi . 
then , a minute later , Vieri beat a lacklustre off-side trap for his side &apos;s fourth and , as Milan &apos;s defence capitulated , Amoruso made it 5-0 . 
with fans leaving the stadium in their hundreds , Marco Simone finally beat Peruzzi to score Milan &apos;s solitary goal . 
but Juventus were still not finished and Vieri made 37-year-old Baresi look his age , outpacing the veteran sweeper before beating the hapless Rossi . 
&quot; Milan did not play that badly , &quot; Berlusconi told reporters after the debacle . 
&quot; 2-1 for the black-and-whites would have been fairer . 
now let me go down to the changing rooms .
