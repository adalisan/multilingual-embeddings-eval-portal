a copper and bronze trail of bells , tweezers and other artifacts could transform how archaeologists look at the political and cultural powerhouses of pre-Colombian Mexico , researchers said on Thursday . 
research appearing in Friday &apos;s edition of the journal Science links metal artifacts from sites as far away as Belize and the Yucatan with mines and ore deposits in western Mexico , long thought to be an ancient backwater . 
&quot; Western Mexico had not been considered a major player in Mesoamerican events , &quot; said Dorothy Hosler , an archaeologist and expert in ancient technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . 
&quot; But these findings show that these people were interacting in an intensive and significant way with other political entities , &quot; said Hosler , who with her Florida International University co-author Andrew Macfarlane used lead isotope analysis to analyse the metal alloys in the artifacts and link them to the West Mexican mines . 
the archaeologists believe that their findings establish that the peoples of western Mexico , including one group known as Tarascans , were deeply involved in the complex network of trade and commerce across Mexico from around 1200 to 1521 A.D. 
by exporting objects that had sacred or political significance , they affected the religious and ritual behaviours of the region , not just the economy , said Hosler . 
she would like to turn her attention to finding the worksites or processing centres to learn more about the artisans , culture and trade . 
because of their grand pyramids and architectural monuments , as well as their well-documented contacts with the Spanish conquest , the Aztecs and the Maya have been the most studied . 
but the Tarascans , who lived in the highlands of Michoacan &quot; are really considered an empire . 
they defeated the Aztecs in various skirmishes , &quot; she said . 
they controlled some mining sites in Michoacan while sites in nearby Jalisco were &quot; presumably under the control of smaller political entities , &quot; she said . 
metallurgy was developed in South America and made its way to Mesoamerica , partly via a coastal maritime route , in around 600 to 700 A.D. , she said . 
it advanced over the next 500 years or so in what is now western Mexico . 
characteristic artifacts included bells , used in healing rituals , shamanistic ceremonies and to communicate with the supernatural and tweezers , particularly oversized tweezers worn as adornments by priests and other members of the elite and probably used to remove facial hair . 
&quot; Tweezers have a fascinating history . 
they were very elaborate and they became some sort of a symbol of political and social power , &quot; added Hosler , who was funded in part by mining and smelting companies in Mexico , Peru and the United States with an interest in uncovering their history . 
Hosler believes that her findings will encourage other archaeologists and anthropologists to take another look at the region , and to start looking for further evidence of trade routes . 
&quot; I think what will happen is people may start looking for these kind of analogies in other materials , like obsidian , which shows up all over Mesoamerica , &quot; she said . 
one question she asks is : if the westerners exported metal products , what did they import in exchange ?
