to chants of &quot; Down with Japanese imperialism &quot; , a ship bearing Hong Kong activists and the body of their leader berthed on Friday after a disastrous protest against Tokyo &apos;s claim to an East China Sea archipelago . 
protest leader David Chan drowned in storm-whipped waters near the disputed islands on Thursday after leaping into the sea to assert China &apos;s sovereignty to the isles and their waters . 
Chan and fellow pro-China activists had hoped to go ashore to strip the islands of Japanese flags and a lighthouse built in July by Japanese ultranationalists . 
but their vessel , the rusting Hong Kong tanker Kien Hwa 2 , was prevented from approaching the islands by a huge force of Japanese coast guard frigates and aircraft . 
Japan has claimed what it calls the Senkakus since seizing them as war booty from China in 1895 . 
China and Taiwan , calling them the Diaoyus , maintain that Japan &apos;s claim is illegal . 
when it put into Taiwan shortly after midnight , the Kien Hwa complied with Taiwan &apos;s request not to enter flying the red flag of communist China , the island &apos;s arch-rival since a civil war split them in 1949 . 
frontier officials and a coroner boarded the vessel , saying the nearly 80 Hong Kong activists , crew and reporters -- and Chan &apos;s body -- would be granted humanitarian passage to Taipei &apos;s airport for a morning flight home to Hong Kong . 
a Chinese flag that had covered Chan &apos;s body also had been removed when it was finally lowered by stretcher to the dock . 
the body was quickly wrapped in yellow cloth , a Buddhist practice , and placed in a coffin not far from a banner reading : &quot; Diaoyu martyr David Chan died for what he believed . 
&quot; I couldn &apos;t grasp what was going through my mind , &quot; reporter Jackson Liao of Hong Kong &apos;s ATV told Reuters as he stepped from the Kien Hwa . 
Liao said most reporters dropped their gear and did what they could to save Chan and another injured protester , though many continued to document the high-seas drama . 
activist Ma Ding said spirits had sagged badly . 
&quot; When it happened everybody felt very saddened , &quot; he said . 
in contrast to the sombre shipboard mood , emotions ran hot on the Keelung dock where some 200 sympathetic demonstrators chanted anti-Japanese slogans and waved flags of the island &apos;s exiled Republic of China government . 
&quot; Down with Japanese imperialism ! 
&quot; shouted members of the opposition New Party , which favours Taiwan &apos;s reunification with China . 
&quot; Protect Chinese sovereignty ! 
protect the Diaoyus ! 
the ship had set out from Hong Kong on Sunday , with protest leader Chan vowing to plant China &apos;s flag on the islands and pull down Japan &apos;s flag and the offending lighthouse . 
after the Japanese patrols thwarted two attempts to approach the islands , Chan and four others donned life vests , tied themselves to ropes and dived into the sea . 
Chan , a 45-year-old non-swimmer , lost consciousness as he was dragged beside the slow-moving ship for some 15 minutes , often disappearing below high waves . 
shipboard protesters initially seemed not to sense the seriousness of Chan &apos;s plight and although alive when pulled aboard , he could not be revived by crew or Japanese medics put aboard by helicopter .
