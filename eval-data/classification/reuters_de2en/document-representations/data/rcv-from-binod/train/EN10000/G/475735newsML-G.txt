Arab states moved close to restoring the political and economic boycott of Israel on Sunday in retaliation for Israel &apos;s settlement policy in East Jerusalem . 
after weeks of statements condemning Israeli practices and lamenting the collapse of Middle East peace talks , Arab foreign ministers decided it was time for action . 
they took the opportunity of a regular Arab League meeting in Cairo to back a recommendation that their countries stop dealing with the Jewish state and reactivate the boycott , which many Arab states have increasingly ignored . 
an Egyptian official said the ministers had reached consensus on the recommendation , which remains in draft form but is likely to become formal at the end of the meeting on Monday . 
two unnamed countries had reservations about the draft but Egypt , the most populous and influential Arab state , is fully behind it , the official added . 
the right-wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has angered all Israel &apos;s neighbours but the final straw was a decision to go ahead with a Jewish settlement project in Jabal Abu Ghneim , a part of East Jerusalem known to Jews as Har Homa . 
Palestinians see Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state . 
the Israelis captured the area in 1967 and have been trying to change the demographic balance in favour of the Jewish community . 
the draft resolution says : &quot; The ( ministerial ) council of the Arab League recommends stopping all normalisation steps which have been taken with Israel in the framework of the peace process and stopping to deal with it ( Israel ) , including closing offices and missions . 
these steps would remain in force &quot; until Israel obeys the Madrid frame of reference and the principle of land for peace , and carries out the agreements , undertaking and commitments which the parties concerned have reached on all tracks during peace talks , &quot; the resolution says . 
it adds : &quot; ( It recommends ) suspending Arab participation in the multilateral talks and continuing to maintain the primary Arab boycott and reactivating it until just peace is achieved . 
said Kamal , an assistant secretary general of the Arab League , told reporters earlier that the ministers would suggest to their heads of state that their countries suspend dealings with Israel and close down any Israeli offices . 
&quot; The council ( of foreign ministers ) recommended stopping the normalisation process ... and stopping all dealings and offices and missions as well as suspending conferences called under the multilateral track , &quot; he said . 
&quot; This is a recommendation that will be submitted to the presidents and kings ( of the Arab states ) , &quot; he added . 
Netanyahu said on Sunday he doubted Arabs would cut ties . 
&quot; I would urge the Arab countries to think of their larger interests , their longer interests , as I urge the Palestinians for the necessity of peace , &quot; he added , speaking on CBS television &apos;s &quot; face the Nation &quot; programme . 
Kamal said the ministerial recommendation would be based on the resolutions of the last Arab summit , which said Arab states would reconsider the gestures made towards Israel if the Jewish state does not fulfil its commitments . 
the Arab summit took place in Cairo in June , at a time when Israel &apos;s neighbours were still waiting to see whether Netanyahu would carry out his hard-line election pledges . 
earlier on Sunday , Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the ministers to press on with plans for a special &quot; uniting for peace &quot; session of the General Assembly to bypass U.S. vetoes of Security Council resolutions critical of Israel . 
the Arab group of states at the United Nations said last week it would request such a meeting after the United States twice blocked resolutions telling Israel to stop building houses for Jews in disputed East Jerusalem .
