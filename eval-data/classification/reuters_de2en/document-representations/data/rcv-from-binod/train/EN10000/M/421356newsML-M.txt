French bond futures slipped to their lowest level since February 10 as investors stood back ahead of Thursday &apos;s auction and watched the contract follow Bunds lower through a series of technical support levels . 
a series of factors weighed on the market and analysts and traders said while investors were nervous in general with yields at these levels there was no one overriding negative factor . 
some traders said there was talk of switching out of bonds into French stocks , the CAC 40 index of blue chip stocks hit a record high on Wednesday , and some said U.S. funds had switched out of European bonds after the U.S. open . 
&quot; The psychology of the markets is truely heavy , &quot; a bond trader at a French bank said . 
he said in the search for yield investors were looking to equity markets for better returns . 
Rachid Medjaoui , analyst at Sogeposte , said while the European markets were consolidating there were no real concerns except if the U.S. market were to collapse . 
he expected 131.50 to hold as a good level of support for the March bond future . 
several analysts said the trend in the French market among investors in recent days has been to shorten duration and there was some selling of the 10-year area and long-dated strips . 
the gap between two- and 10-year bond yields climbed six basis points while the gap between two- and 30-year bonds climbed five basis points . 
&quot; There &apos;s still a reluctance to put too much money to work to long on the curve , its going more to the short end of the curve , &quot; Iain Lindsay , bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais said . 
he said while continental equity markets looked good value compared to bond markets and money appeared to have been going into French stocks recently , it was not enough to cause much concern for the bond market . 
Joanne Perez , strategist at Merrill Lynch in Paris said while it was true people had been looking more favourably at the CAC-40 index recently she did not think money would be drained away from the bond market . 
she said intra-day trading charts for Wednesday showed the session had been largely driven by technical support levels . 
the bearish open near 131.80 had prompted stop loss selling and this was repeated again below support at 131.66 . 
&quot; German GDP was a little strong , unemployment a bit lower than some had feared ... but all we &apos;re saying is there &apos;s no real money coming into the market , &quot; she said . 
&quot; People are a little bit concerned we &apos;ve outperformed the U.S. so much , there &apos;s a little bit of nervousness , but no one event triggered the stops , &quot; Perez added . 
traders said besides the German GDP figures , rumours that the Bundesbank would set a variable repo rate , and that it would rise , had weighed on the market early in the day . 
Sonja Gibbs , bond strategist at Nomura International said there appeared to be a heightened perception among investors of risks ahead in the U.S. , Japan and Germany , all making them wary about holding bonds . 
&quot; You &apos;re walking along several tightropes , with three ongoing risks , and any market could suffer . 
analysts said Thursday &apos;s OAT auction had probably weighed on the market today and some said there was a chance of a rebound once it was out of the way . 
however caution ahead of U.S. jobs figures on Friday was likely to keep the contract capped just above 132 in the event of any gains . 
one said the curve steepening on Wednesday could give the new 2009 TEC 10 on sale for the first time a lease of life although there was probably enough natural demand for the instrument to ensure the sale went well anyway . 
the franc continued to suffer from the dollar strength against the mark . 
it fell as low as 5.7909 , the lowest this year , and down from 5.1885 at the end of December . 
it was stable against the mark at 3.3740 .
