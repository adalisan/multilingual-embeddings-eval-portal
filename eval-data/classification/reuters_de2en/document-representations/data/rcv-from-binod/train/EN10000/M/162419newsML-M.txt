South Korea &apos;s ailing stocks are expected to drift lower in November despite government measures to boost a market swamped by huge supplies and an overhang of margin loans , brokers said on Sunday . 
&quot; November has more bad news for the market than good news , &quot; said Choo Hee-yup , a broker at Dongwon Securities . 
&quot; The composite index will likely test 720 during the month . 
the index closed at 765.73 on Saturday , down about 22 percent from a year high of 986.84 in May . 
brokers said stock supplies in November were estimated at more than 1.1 trillion won ( $ 1.45 billion ) and about 500 billion won borrowed for margin trading was due to be repaid this month . 
rights and bonus issues alone added up to 650 billion won . 
the majority state-owned Korea Telecom is also due to sell 13.3 million shares this month , valued at 500 billion won . 
&quot; I doubt the market ( will ) survive the burden , especially when economic conditions are deteriorating . 
government steps will have only a temporary effect , &quot; said Koh Kyong-bae , a broker at Hyundai Securities . 
in its most recent attempt to buoy the market , the finance ministry said on Friday it would delay plans to privatise four big corporations -- Korea Gas , Korea Tobacco &amp; ginseng Corp , Korea Telecom and Korea Heavy Industries &amp; Construction . 
the ministry said it would be difficult to sell such a large amount of government stock in the current climate . 
Korea Gas and Korea Heavy Industries were set to be privatised in 1995 , while the Korea Tobacco &amp; ginseng Corp , the liquor and cigarette monopoly , was to be handed over to the private sector in 1998 . 
the central Bank of Korea in October revealed a plan to lower the reserve requirement ratio for banks to an average of 5.5 percent , effective November 8 , a step that would lead to interest rate cuts . 
&quot; Hopes of lower interest rates worked only after a deep consolidation . 
now the plan to cut rates is unlikely to succeed because of a huge volume of bond issues this month , &quot; said a Seoul Securities broker . 
new issues for three-year corporate bonds are estimated at 3.1 trillion won , compared with a monthly average of 2.5 trillion . 
&quot; Basically , investors have lost confidence about the market . 
any noticeable recovery is highly unlikely unless economic fundamentals improve , &quot; said Choo of Dongwon . 
plunging prices for South Korea &apos;s major exports continue to erode corporate profits . 
the trade deficit , snowballing on a slump in exports of semiconductors , petrochemicals and steel products , could exceed $ 20 billion this year , compared with $ 10 billion in 1995 . 
South Korea has said the wider deficit would limit economic growth this year to about seven percent , down from nine percent last year .
