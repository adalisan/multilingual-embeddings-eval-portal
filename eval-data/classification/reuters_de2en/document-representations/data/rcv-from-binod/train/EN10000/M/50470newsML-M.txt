Gulf refined product and crude prices and premiums are unlikely to retreat far as long as tension between Iraq and the United States dominates news headlines , Gulf oil traders said on Thursday . 
oil prices have been pushed to their highest levels since the 1990-1991 Gulf War after Iraq called the imminent deployment of U.S. &quot; stealth &quot; fighters in Kuwait an act of war . 
U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry on Wednesday announced the deployment of the radar-evading F-117As and also B-52 heavy bombers after Iraq fired a surface-to-air missile at two U.S. planes patrolling the northern no-fly zone . 
Iraq has warned that it will defend itself against any U.S. military action and also defy allied no-fly zones over Iraq . 
Middle East benchmark Dubai Fateh crude for November delivery gained $ 1.35 in the week to trade at $ 21.15 a barrel by 1600 GMT , compared to a 1995 average price of $ 16.10 . 
&quot; No one is going to relax in this situation . 
how can you read ( Iraqi President ) Saddam Hussein ? 
&quot; a Gulf trader said . 
few traders would hazard a guess when limited exports of Iraqi oil might return to the market under a U.N. oil-for-deal , on the verge of being implemented until Iraq-backed Kurds launched attacks against a rival Kurdish group in northern Iraq . 
the 15 million barrels per day ( bpd ) of Gulf crude and product exported through the Strait of Hormuz is one of the most strategic arteries in the oil business and any threat to these supplies , real or perceived , spark prices higher . 
though traders said supplies from key Gulf producers Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates were unlikely to be affected by an escalation in tension between Washington and Baghdad , sellers were able to hold out for higher numbers . 
prompt Gulf gas oil cargoes were said offered at a strong $ 1 premium to independent price quotes for one percent sulphur material and an additional 20 cents for 0.5 percent grade . 
gas oil gained a dollar in the week and was assessed at $ 26.60 a barrel fob Gulf on Thursday , its highest level since February . 
sellers of jet also talked up prospects for increased jet fuel supplies if U.S. air attacks against Iraqi targets and allied air patrols of the two no-fly zones in Iraq increased . 
jet was assessed $ 28.70 a barrel . 
market fundamentals were also supported by a high Meditteranean-Gulf differential which closed off Mediterranean exports to the Gulf and winter demand for heating fuels . 
bunker markets at the Gulf refuelling centre of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates were also caught in the crude rally , moving up to $ 112-113 a tonne from $ 111 .
