after winning an unprecedented 18 major golf championships and playing in an incredible 41 consecutive U.S. 
opens , Jack Nicklaus is a multi-millionaire with no more world &apos;s to conquer . 
but at age 57 , the Golden Bear says he &apos;s not ready to quit competing . 
&quot; I &apos;m playing the best golf I &apos;ve played in 10 years , &quot; he said after completing the U.S. Open at the Congresssional Country Club Sunday with a four-over-par 74 and a final total of 13 over par . 
he was cheered throughout the tournament by big galleries and enjoyed the fact that one of his fellow competitors was his son Gary . 
Gary Nicklaus failed to make the cut , losing the chance to play the same Open as his dad on Father &apos;s Day . 
but another of Nicklaus &apos;s four sons , Jackie , was with him on the course Sunday as his caddie . 
&quot; He gave up his Father &apos;s Day for me . 
he has four kids at home and I really appreciate that , &quot; Nicklaus said . 
Nicklaus left open the possibility that he would play in the British Open at Royal Troon in July , saying if he was playing well , he would add to his record by entering his 151st major championship .
