crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) edged lower in very thin trade Monday as the market struggled to find direction . 
Front-month June crude , having traded within a narrow range , settled eight cents lower at $ 19.91 a barrel . 
may gasoline futures ended 0.16 down at 62.34 cents a gallon but heating oil gained 0.63 to 56.53 ahead of Wednesday &apos;s expiry . 
&quot; We &apos;re stuck in a range -- sellers are cautious because of of the Shell Nigeria situation but buyers are wary with ( technical ) resistance nearby , &quot; said Thomas Blakeslee , an oil trader at Cargill investor Services in New York . 
political violence in Nigeria &apos;s Warri oil-producing region , which forced producer Royal Dutch Shell Group last week to delay a number of April and May shipments , has kept a floor under prices but the disruption has not been enough to lift an oversupplied market , traders said . 
Nigeria accounts for about 10 percent of the seven-to-eight million barrels of crude the U.S. imports daily . 
but traders said the situation there hasn &apos;t yet threatened to seriously disrupt supply or transport for long enough to curb exports . 
that was illustrated by Monday &apos;s unusually quiet market , they said . 
&quot; Volume was like holiday-type volume , &quot; said Blakeslee . 
Front-month crude , having slumped nearly 30 percent in the first quarter , appears to be firmly tucked into a $ 19.50- $ 20.50 range , with around $ 20.25 the resistance level traders were looking for to trigger stop-loss &apos; buy &apos; orders on Monday . 
June crude couldn &apos;t get above $ 20.03 . 
also , breaking a pattern set in the previous five years , the gasoline market has not surged in the run-up to the &quot; driving season , &quot; which traditionally starts on Memorial Day , despite record-low inventories . 
gasoline futures , which peaked early January at around 72.50 cents a gallon , have been capped just above 63 cents for the past few weeks and show no signs yet of making a bullish run as output and imports remain high , traders said .
