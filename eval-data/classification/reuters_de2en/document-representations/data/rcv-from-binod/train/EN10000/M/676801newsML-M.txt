IPE oil futures fell on Friday afternoon , pushed down by weakness in NYMEX crude and gasoline markets and by technical factors , brokers said . 
at 1433 GMT August Brent futures had emerged from their morning stagnation to trade at $ 17.50 a barrel , down 28 cents . 
they broke through major support at $ 17.61 and started to head to the 13-month low of $ 17.38 on the spot chart , dealers said . 
in New York the front-month July , which expires at the end of business today , was at $ 18.37 a barrel , 30 cents down in early business and breaking support at $ 18.41 a barrel . 
gasoline began the fall but was overtaken by crude . 
&quot; There is nothing in particular taking us down , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; It is just general negativity in the market . 
other players said New York markets were being pushed lower ahead of the expiry . 
the continued worry over when Iraq would resume its crude exports was no longer offering the support it did on Thursday , when markets steadied after a heavy mid-week fall . 
nor was the forthcoming meeting of OPEC ministers in Vienna seen as a bullish factor . 
brokers were not expecting any drastic news from the 11-member cartel which they believed would probably just &quot; roll over &quot; the current production quota . 
gas oil trade was thin but trailed downwards in the wake of the fall in the major markets . 
Front-month contracts were at $ 158.50 a tonne at 1440 GMT , having fallen through the key support at $ 160 .
