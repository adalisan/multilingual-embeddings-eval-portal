France has medium-term growth potential of 2.5 to three percent , Bank of France governor Jean-Claude Trichet said in an interview published on Monday with afternoon daily Le Monde . 
the government is forecasting growth this year of 1.3 percent . 
&quot; We believe that we have the capacity to do better in the medium term -- 2.5 percent to three percent on average , per year , given the possible catch-up in growth , &quot; he said . 
Trichet told a news conference last week that he believed France &apos;s medium-term growth potential was 2.5 percent or more . 
Trichet repeated a call to French businesses to invest now as the best means of contributing to non-inflationary , job creating growth . 
France also needed structural reforms to bring down unemployment , he said . 
&quot; We need structural reforms to make our growth richer in employment , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Some countries are doing better than us as regards unemployment , and there are lessons to be drawn in the United States and in Europe . 
&quot; But my personal feeling is that , in the end it is in continental Europe , in the Netherlands and Denmark , that we can draw the most lessons , because these countries have the same values as us ... &quot; he said . 
as regards the switch to the single European currency , Trichet said he did not expect any last-minute jostling to try to get a favourable exchange rate against the euro for national currencies . 
&quot; For the future , I do not believe in the slightest bit in a parity war , &quot; he said . 
this would have no sense and be counter to the Maastricht treaty . 
&quot; To join the single currency , you have to show you have had a stable currency in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism . 
stability is measured in relation to the central rates in this mechanism . 
&quot; All governments and all central banks believe that these central rates are in line with the fundamentals in the economies involved . 
under these conditions , fixing parities will be done , in my opinion , in a perfectly natural and non-conflictual way , &quot; he said .
