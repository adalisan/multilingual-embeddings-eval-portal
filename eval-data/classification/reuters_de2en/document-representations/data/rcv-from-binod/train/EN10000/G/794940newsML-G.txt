former New Zealand First MP Michael Laws on Tuesday said the coalition had become more important to Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters than his party , and predicted NZ First would be finished at the next election . 
&quot; Winston Peters had ... decided something else in his mind .... 
he was quite prepared to sacrifice the latter to preserve the former , &quot; Laws , once a close friend and advisor to Peters , said in his regular newspaper column . 
&quot; Which is why , after the next general election , there won &apos;t be a NZ First party . 
and unless a deal is struck ( with National ) in ( Peters &apos; seat of ) Tauranga there won &apos;t even be a Winston , &quot; Laws said . 
NZ First and the larger conservative National Party signed a coalition deal in December . 
laws was an advisor to Associate Health Minister Neil Kirton who was sacked last week . 
he resigned his seat in 1996 after a minor scandal involving a signature on a local body poll . 
laws said at the election due in 1999 NZ First would not get anywhere near the five percent threshold which assures parties of their share of seats under New Zealand &apos;s German-style mixed member proportional electoral system . 
NZ First won 13 percent of the vote at the October 1996 general election but its support has dropped to less than five percent in recent polls . 
earlier in the day , Peters confirmed that Laws had lost his job as advisor to Kirton .
