Pakistan &apos;s newly-appointed finance minister said on Thursday this week &apos;s accord with the International Monetary Fund should help get the inflation-ridden economy back on track . 
&quot; This agreement with the IMF will give us support and add a lot of confidence in the market because a number of other institutions like the World Bank , even private sector banks , were holding back till this decision , &quot; Naveed Qamar , 41 , told Reuters Financial Television in an interview . 
&quot; The major reason for the inflation we were having was heavy government borrowing and the first priority is to bring the deficit under control , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Once we have brought inflation under control , then we will be looking at other priorities . 
Pakistan &apos;s consumer price index rose 9.83 percent in the year to September , compared to 12.49 percent a year earlier , but many economists say official figures are grossly understated . 
Qamar , who was appointed on Monday , said a formal agreement on reactivating a stalled $ 600 million standby loan was likely to be signed on Tuesday with Paul Chabrier , an IMF director . 
the IMF withheld tranches worth about $ 80 million each that had been due in June and September because Pakistan was failing to meet its targets , especially on cutting the budget deficit . 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto &apos;s government had promised the IMF under the original standby agreement to reduce the deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product in 1995 / 96 ( July-June ) . 
instead the deficit swelled to 5.8 percent , while the current account deficit grew to 6.6 percent of GDP . 
Qamar said Pakistan needed to rebuild its foreign reserve position . 
&quot; As of today , it was around $ 700 million ( excluding gold ) , but it should rapidly start improving , &quot; he said . 
foreign reserves stood at about $ 1.3 billion a year ago . 
the IMF agreed to revive the standby loan on the basis of a stabilisation package Pakistan unveiled on October 22 . 
it included spending cuts , new taxes , a 10 percent oil price rise and a 7.86 percent devaluation of the rupee against the dollar . 
Qamar said the devaluation had more than closed the gap between the central bank and unofficial exchange rates . 
&quot; already now with the new IMF agreements and the anticipated monies flowing in , I don &apos;t see we would be needing to do any further devaluations , &quot; he said . 
Qamar said he wanted to implement more stringent monitoring of the economy to give policy-makers clear information and provide an early warning if things went wrong . 
&quot; We are putting in place , along with the IMF , methodologies by which we will monitor the entire process and its implementation from day one , &quot; he said . 
the IMF is known to have viewed some of the data provided by Bhutto &apos;s previous economic team as suspect . 
Qamar , who took over the finance portfolio from Bhutto , said he would provide a single policy-making focus , but would also consult widely to gain input from different sectors . 
otherwise , he said , &quot; You make policies but within months they start crumbling , &quot; citing the experience of the June budget which was followed by months of haggling with various lobbies . 
&quot; We hope that we will be able to involve the private sector and that is why along with me I have a team of private sector advisers ... so that we can formulate policies on a longer term which come from the people , &quot; he said .
