Belgian judicial authorities said on Tuesday that they were still hopeful that two teenage girls missing in the country &apos;s largest child sex scandal would be found alive . 
&quot; There are elements that allow us to believe that the two girls are still alive , &quot; public prosecutor , magistrate Michel Bourlet told a news conference in this southern town . 
he said police were still searching for teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks kidnapped by convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux in the port of Ostend last August . 
Bourlet called the meeting to quash a groundswell of rumours surrounding the abduction case after 14-year-old Laetitia Delhez and 12-year-old Sabine Dardenne were rescued from a makeshift dungeon in a house owned by Dutroux . 
events turned tragic when , after Friday &apos;s discovery of the teenagers , Dutroux led police on Saturday to the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo buried in another house owned by Dutroux near Charleroi . 
Prosecutor Bourlet declined to give any details on the grounds for his optimism . 
&quot; I will not give any details of the dossier , &quot; he said , adding that if there was something to report he would first tell the parents of the two missing girls . 
&quot; We are focusing on trying to find An and Eefje . 
we are still hopeful , &quot; Bourlet told a packed conference room . 
Dutroux , serving four months in jail for theft at the time , denied responsibility for the deaths of Julie and Melissa , kidnapped in June 1995 , of starvation . 
but he admitted paying two accomplices 40,000 francs ( $ 1,300 ) for the girls . 
the whereabouts of An and Eefje are unknown . 
Belgian media speculated the two had been found in the Czech Republic . 
however , Bourlet firmly squashed that rumour . 
Interpol in the Czech Republic -- one of a number of countries contacted on Tuesday -- said there was no trace of the girls on Czech soil . 
asked whether Belgium had been in touch with authorities in Great Britain , The Netherlands and Slovakia as well as in the Czech Republic , he said , &quot; We have contacts galore ... we have contacts with Interpol , but also with others . 
Bourlet said Belgian Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck , who visited the prosecutor &apos;s office earlier in Tuesday , had agreed to rent special equipment used in Britain for property searches . 
he was referring to devices used in the investigation into Britain &apos;s &quot; House of horrors &quot; serial killings in which a dozen young women were murdered . 
earlier on Tuesday the Central Bureau of Investigation of the Police asked John Bennett , the officer who dealt with the West investigation , for advice in their search for further possible victims of an organised paedophile ring .
