Britain &apos;s outspoken Duchess of York , deeply in debt and hounded by the media at home , is trying to carve a deal to become an American TV talkshow host , according to the Wednesday edition of Hollywood trade paper Daily variety . 
the former Sarah Ferguson , divorced last May from Queen Elizabeth &apos;s second son Prince Andrew , is planning to meet with several Hollywood studios to discuss the possibility of her hosting a daily talkshow next year , the paper said . 
several syndicators , including Twentieth TV , owned by News Corp. , and Disney-owned Buena Vista TV , have expressed serious interest in a talkshow with Ferguson , better know as &quot; Fergie &quot; . 
sources say ABC is also considering the idea as a possible replacement for its struggling show Caryl &amp; Marilyn . 
aside from a talkshow , industry sources say ABC is close to signing a deal to have Ferguson host at least one primetime special executive produced by Bruce Nash described as &quot; adventures with the Duchess . 
&quot; More specials could follow . 
Hollywood interest in Ferguson was ignited in part by her recent primetime Live interview with Diane Sawyer , which drew a 14.1 rating and 24 share , up four share points from the show &apos;s season average . 
each rating point represents an estimated 970,000 households , or one percent of the country &apos;s homes . 
variety reported Ferguson spokesman Howard Rubenstein as confirming the Duchess , who has been in the U.S. promoting her book &quot; My Story &quot; , is &quot; considering &quot; a daytime talkshow , among other showbusiness prospects . 
distributors said International Creative Management was setting up the meetings . 
&quot; She &apos;s been getting a great many offers &quot; but has made no firm commitments , Rubenstein said . 
&quot; Ever since her media tour , interest has escalated . 
crowds are building at each of her book signings . 
her image has changed dramatically . 
no production talent is yet attached to the idea of a Fergie talkshow , and details of the format are undetermined , variety said . 
sources said no one was sure whether such a show would be shot in London or the U.S. 
while Ferguson is showing enough interest to meet with studios , it was unclear whether she would want to tackle the rigorous schedule of a daily talkshow , variety said . 
&quot; Her primary concern is being close to her children , &quot; Rubenstein said . 
&quot; If this interferes seriously , she will opt not to do it , but there may be ways of working it out . 
if Ferguson does agree to dive into daytime , there is likely to be a feeding frenzy among hit-starved distributors , which are anxiously searching for stars to host talkshows . 
the saga of the British royal family draws tremendous interest among the American public . 
&quot; Everyone will be interested in this , &quot; one studio source said . 
&quot; The question is , &apos; Will she do it ?
