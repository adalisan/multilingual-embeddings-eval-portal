orders received by U.S. factories fell for a second consecutive month in December , the Commerce Department said on Wednesday , adding to signs of moderating manufacturing activity early in 1997 . 
the value of new orders dropped 1.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 315.93 billion following a revised 0.5 percent decrease in November orders . 
shipments of finished goods also declined in December and inventories of completed products fell for the first time since June , suggesting that production was leveling off as last year ended . 
the report came just hours before Federal Reserve policy-makers were scheduled to conclude a two-day meeting on interest-rate strategy . 
expectations were that the central bank would leave rates unchanged amid indications that economic growth was gradually slowing from its strong pace late in 1996 . 
on Monday , the National Association of Purchasing Management said its latest survey confirmed that the manufacturing sector had lost some steam in January . 
its index of activity eased to 52 points from 53.8 in December . 
while any reading over 50 in the NAPM index shows expansion , it meant manufacturing was less brisk as 1997 began than at the end of last year . 
the December factory orders report said demand faltered during the month for both costly durable goods and for more quickly used non-durables . 
during December , orders for durable goods like new cars and refrigerators fell a revised 1.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 168.6 billion following a drop of 1.7 percent in November . 
the department had earlier reported that December durables orders had fallen 1.7 percent , but it revised that to show a slightly steeper drop . 
orders for non-durables like food and paper products also weakened in December , falling 0.7 percent to $ 147.3 billion after a 0.9 percent increase in November . 
inventories of finished goods were down in December by 0.3 percent to $ 438.2 billion -- the first drop in six months -- after a 0.3 percent increase in November . 
economist Elliott Platt of Donaldson , Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York said that despite &quot; extremely lean &quot; stocks of goods it was unlikely that factories would get busier in the near term . 
&quot; That ... will not prompt any pickup in production , given the impending weakness in plant and equipment spending and the likelihood that the trade deficit will not improve during this year , &quot; Platt said . 
December marked the fifth month in 1996 that factory orders fell . 
orders for the full year were up 4.9 percent from 1995 to $ 3.75 trillion following a 6.6 percent rise in 1995 . 
it was the weakest rise in annual orders since 1993 , when they grew by only 3.8 percent , department officials said . 
the biggest fall-off in December orders occurred for electronic and electrical equipment , down 12.7 percent to $ 24.4 billion following a 10.3 percent decrease in November . 
the department said the monthly decline reflected fewer orders for communications equipment and electronic components . 
transportation equipment orders eased 0.6 percent to $ 41.7 billion after a 0.8 percent increase in November . 
shipments of manufactured goods , which reflect more immediate demand than orders , declined by 0.6 percent to $ 315.6 billion in December after a 0.6 percent rise in November . 
orders for non-defence capital goods , a measure of business expansion plans , fell 0.1 percent in December to $ 43.8 billion after a 7.6 percent decline in November . 
orders for industrial machinery rose by 1.4 percent in December to $ 32 billion after a 0.9 percent decline in November .
