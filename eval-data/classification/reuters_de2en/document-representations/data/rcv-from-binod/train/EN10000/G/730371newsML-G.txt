an Algerian court has condemned 24 Moslem militants to death for their involvement in guerrilla activities against the Algerian state , the official Algerian news agency APS said on Tuesday . 
the militants were among 127 people standing trial before the criminal court in Medea , 70 km ( 45 miles ) south of Algiers , APS said . 
the trials took place between June 14 and July 14 . 
the court sentenced one person to life in jail and eight others for 20 years &apos; imprisonment , said APS . 
the court also condemned an unspecified number of other defendants to up to 15 years and acquitted others , said APS without giving more details . 
the Algerian government has been locked in conflict with radical Moslem fundamentalists since 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which Islamists took a huge lead . 
about 60,000 people have been killed since then . 
more than 1,000 fundamentalist activists have been sentenced to death since 1993 when Algerian courts started trying militants for rebellion activities .
