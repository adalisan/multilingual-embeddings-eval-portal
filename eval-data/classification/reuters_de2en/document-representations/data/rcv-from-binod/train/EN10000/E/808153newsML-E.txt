Albania &apos;s Finance Ministry and a team of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) experts began talks on Tuesday on a three-year accord to improve the Albanian economy , the Finance Minister said . 
Arben Malaj told Radio Tirana that an agreement with the IMF could be hammered out if a six-month stabilisation programme was successful . 
&quot; After this programme and the adoption of decisions involving the political will of parliament , we hope to sign a three-year agreement , &quot; Malaj said , according to state radio . 
Malaj said the three-year accord would cover the budget deficit , fiscal policies and the regulation of pyramid investment schemes , some of which collapsed earlier this year and sparked widespread violence , the radio added . 
the IMF mission is headed by its Albania chief Juha Kahkonen , who is expected to arrive on Saturday . 
the delegation expects to leave on September 3 and Malaj warned that few details would be released before talks were concluded . 
a source close to negotiations said discussions on Tuesday included the appointment of administrators to control the remaining high-interest loaning schemes . 
the collapse of pyramid schemes offering the same dividends brought Albania to the brink of civil war in March and triggered months of anarchy that led to the downfall of the right-wing government of former president Sali Berisha . 
it has adopted a law to audit the nation &apos;s surviving high-interest investment schemes and to examine defunct pyramid schemes in a bid to return at least some of the population &apos;s lost savings . 
international financial institutions and foreign donors have told Albania that before it receives any loan , it will have to beef up its finances and make sure shady pyramid investment schemes can no longer flourish . 
the budget deficit is set to reach 44 billion leks , or 11.6 percent of gross domestic product , this year and inflation is expected to rise to 45-50 percent . 
next week . 
another IMF mission will come to Albania to offer technical assistance to the tax and customs department . 
it is scheduled to leave on September 9 .
