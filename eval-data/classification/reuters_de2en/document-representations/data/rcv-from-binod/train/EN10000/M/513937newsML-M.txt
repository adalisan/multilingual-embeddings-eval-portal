French bond futures finished MATIF pit-trading flat on Wednesday after an early technical push fizzled out and the consequent retreat was accentuated after strong U.S. industrial production data . 
Thursday &apos;s key external influence will be the release of German IFO business confidence index , expected at 0800 GMT . 
early short-covering and a technical push to test the 129.32 50 percent retracement level between the year &apos;s highs and lows failed to stimulate buying in the June 10-year future early in the day , after which the contract started sliding , traders said . 
market optimism following an inflation-benign U.S. consumer price report on Tuesday gave way to renewed speculation about a U.S. rate hike in May after the release of March industrial production data showed a rise of 0.9 percent versus expectations in the market of a 0.6 percent increase . 
many expect a slowdown in the United States in the second half of the year but see a risk of turbulence from strong U.S. figures before that . 
traders said there was little activity in the cash market in Paris and that futures were looking to other markets for direction . 
PIBOR three-month interest rate futures also lost ground in the afternoon , with the June contract settling two basis points lower at 96.68 . 
yields on the 5.50 percent OAT due 2007 stood at 5.71 percent , versus 5.70 on Tuesday , with the spread showing no divergence from its German equivelent at minus 13 basis points . 
from inside France , the market will also feel the influence on Thursday morning of the auction of 22-24 billion francs of BTANS , the 4.75 April 12 , 1999 note and the 4.75 March 12 , 2002 BTAN .
