thirteen-year-old Beauty had to entertain five clients each day during her two months in a Dhaka brothel before she was rescued by a women lawyers &apos; group . 
&quot; They came of all ages , had different taste and demands . 
I had to satisfy them , to the best of my ability , to escape torture , &quot; the girl said , two days after she was housed in a shelter run by the Bangladesh National Women Lawyers &apos; Association ( BNWLA ) . 
the girl is part of a horrific chain of abuse and murder affecting Bangladeshi women . 
&quot; It &apos;s hard to believe ... but it &apos;s the truth . 
it &apos;s the cruel reality we face , &quot; said Salma Ali , executive director of the association . 
the home , which can accommodate at most 30 girls even if they share beds and sleep on the floor , has been the last hope for some girls . 
they have little prospect of being restored to their parents , having a family or living freely . 
&quot; My mother has refused to take me back because her second husband would not accept me , &quot; said 10-year-old Tiya . 
a deal was made between the man who stole me from my family and a prospective buyer for 100,000 taka ( $ 2,500 ) , &quot; she said . 
also in the BNWLA home was Rahima , who was married in 1993 . 
&quot; I had almost three years of married life but suddenly my husband started to change . 
&quot; One day he cut off one of my hands , one leg and a ear . 
that was not enough for him . 
he tied me up and left me on a train line where someone found and brought me to this home . 
BNWLA trained Rahima to teach knitting to other girls at the shelter . 
&quot; This is an unending story of unfolding tragedies , &quot; said Salma Ali , a senior lawyer . 
the girls at the shelter said they loved Ali very much . 
&quot; She is just mother-like , caring , highly disciplined and a good administrator , &quot; Rahima told Reuters . 
Ali &apos;s work continues outside the shelter . 
Juthi , 17 , does not live in the home but visits Ali almost every week , along with her sister Moyna . 
Juthi was rescued with BNWLA &apos;s help while she was being smuggled into India . 
the BNWLA is helping Moyna in her search for her son , who was picked up by a family friend one day but never seen again . 
&quot; We deal with a variety of cases -- trafficking , torture , rape , prostitution , &quot; Ali said . 
she said she was investigating reports of smuggled women and children not only being sexually abused but also killed for their body parts . 
&quot; If only part of the reports we have are true I can say humanity is in danger at a time when everybody talks about human rights , &quot; she said . 
a draft report prepared by BNWLA member Mominul Islam said confessions made by some traffickers arrested by police revealed that &quot; corneas , kidneys and blood extracted from children &quot; were sold at a high price , especially in India . 
it said Bangladeshis smuggled to India were also killed and their skeletons sold . 
&quot; India is the world &apos;s biggest skeleton exporter . 
but Indian people are mostly Hindus who are cremated ; the Moslems are very sensitive and their bodies cannot be used for skeleton exports . 
&quot; Then the likelihood is that most of the skeletons come from people smuggled in from other countries . 
the traffickers are possibly the main source for supplying kidneys , blood , corneas in the Indian hospitals and clinics , &quot; the report said . 
a 1995 Bangladeshi law providing for the death sentence as the maximum penalty for torture , rape , trafficking and killing of women and children has also been largely ineffective , lawyers said . 
BNWLA said some 200,000 Bangladeshi women were smuggled to Pakistan alone over the last 10 years . 
most victims come from poor families and are lured by traffickers on fake promises of jobs , marriage and good life , Ali said . 
&quot; Trying to save the victims and curb the growing flesh trade has been an uphill task . 
but we will not to give up .
