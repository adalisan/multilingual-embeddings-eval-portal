every day that passes without Zambian President Frederick Chiluba naming a date for general elections pushes the country closer to a new political crisis , Chiluba &apos;s critics say . 
the five-year mandate of Chiluba &apos;s government expires on October 31 , but the likelihood of new elections being held before then is rapidly fading . 
the government says new laws it passed recently allow it to remain in office up to three months beyond the dissolution of parliament , giving it a breathing space until the end of January to hold elections . 
but Dean Mungomba , leader of the opposition Zambia Democratic Congress , said : 
&quot; On October 31 , Mr Chiluba &apos;s term of office comes to an end . 
no amount of legal gymnastics can change that fact . 
&quot; We shall have no recognition of this government after October 31 , and therefore reserve the right to take whatever steps to ensure he does not extend his stay in office beyond October 31 . 
the Law Association of Zambia has said the government is misreading the constitution if it thinks it has until January to hold elections . 
it said the government would legally cease to exist as soon as parliament was dissolved . 
former army commander and home affairs minister Kingsley Chinkuli , a member of the opposition United National Independence Party ( UNIP ) , raised the possibility of a coup if elections were not held by the end of the month . 
&quot; When you create a vacuum , someone will always try to fill it , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The repercussions of a military takeover are quite nasty but it can be inevitable if things continue as they are . 
our leaders should do something so that we do not allow our brothers in the barracks to take over . 
the head of the Legal Resource Foundation and chairman of Civil Society , a grouping of non-governmental organisations , John Sangwa , said the constitution did not allow the government to remain in office after parliament was dissolved . 
&quot; If it does , it is anyone &apos;s guess what will happen . 
Alfred Chanda , acting president of the church-backed Forum for a Democratic Process ( FODEP ) , described the political climate as &quot; quite dangerous . 
&quot; It could lead to something unpalatable . 
I hope it does not trigger something that will run out of control , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The constitution is not very clear on what should happen in the transitional period . 
in the past , this problem never arose because elections were held before the expiry of the existing mandate . 
however Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda has dismissed fears about the consequences of not holding an election this month . 
&quot; We will definitely hold elections this year . 
we are not happy that there are people who think the ( ruling ) Movement for multi-party Democracy ( MMD ) does not want to hold elections . 
&quot; Elections will be held , definitely not in 1997 . 
government officials have said that because of a foreign aid squeeze , imposed by donors out of unhappiness with recent legislation introduced by Chiluba &apos;s government , Zambia might not have the money to hold elections this month even if it wanted to . 
the donors object to laws barring people who have already served two terms as president from running for the office again . 
this would rule out Chiluba &apos;s rival Kenneth Kaunda , head of UNIP who led the country to independence in 1964 and was voted out of office only in 1991 . 
there are also concerns about the registration of voters , undertaken by an Israeli computer firm . 
the company has registered only half of the country &apos;s 4.6 eligible voters . 
of those that are registered , tens of thousands have failed to collect their voter cards and thousands of others have been given the wrong cards . 
&quot; We will not recognise an election in which less than 50 percent of the eligible voters participate , &quot; Japanese embassy official Takayuki Miyashita said . 
financial analysts say the uncertainty surrounding the election is harming the economy . 
&quot; worries over the timing and conduct of the election ... are an obstacle not just to resumed donor support but also to the revival of investor confidence both at home and abroad , &quot; the Standard Chartered Bank said in its monthly journal .
