precious metals were mostly weaker on Wednesday and the market was eyeing silver for a signal of the market &apos;s next move , dealers said . 
&quot; We &apos;re due for something , and it &apos;s probably silver that will do it , &quot; a dealer said . 
gold and silver have been stuck in narrow price ranges in recent days after last week &apos;s push higher . 
Bullion fixed at $ 380.80 an ounce , compared to $ 381.00 on Tuesday morning and afternoon . 
prices barely moved early on , although brisk two-way business was seen . 
&quot; There &apos;s stuff going on but the books are balanced so you don &apos;t see it , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; There &apos;s a little speculative trade , the buying is short covering and the selling is fresh . 
news earlier this week that the Belgian central bank had finished selling its gold reserves had little noticable effect on the market . 
analysts had said the news that gold from at least one central bank would no longer enter the marketplace should be reckoned at least mildly bullish . 
but several dealers said the market was indifferent because volumes of Belgian sales had never disrupted the market anyway . 
&quot; The only thing that &apos;s come out of this is a bit of shortcovering by people who thought there was central bank selling a couple of weeks ago -- which was rubbish anyway , &quot; one dealer said . 
silver prices were down one cent from Tuesday &apos;s London close , at $ 5.01 / $ 5.03 an ounce . 
it came off overnight highs around $ 5.05 an ounce and showed little enthusiasm for a rally . 
prices were expected to hold within its $ 5.00- $ 5.10 range , or probe lower to establish a base in the new price band . 
&quot; While the platinum group metals are under pressure that stops silver rallying , &quot; a dealer said . 
platinum and palladium were drifting lower , burdened by slack industrial demand and steady producer supply . 
platinum indicated at $ 383.50 / $ 384.50 , was down $ 1.50 an ounce from Tuesday &apos;s London close and was vulnerable towards recent lows around the $ 380 support level . 
palladium was unchanged at $ 116.00 / $ 117.00 , but looked headed for lower territory , with $ 115 and then $ 110 targeted .
