Brent crude futures were untraded at midday on Thursday but were steady in line with NYMEX . 
July Brent on SIMEX was quoted at $ 18.65 / $ 18.77 per barrel after London dropped 18 cents to $ 18.72 in the wake of bearish API data . 
brokers said further U.S. stock data from the Department of the Environment painted a less bearish picture than the American Petroleum Institute but failed to turn prices higher . 
however , traders said the Brent downside was limited to support around $ 18.40 / $ 18.50 and was susceptible to a rebound following a more than 80-cent fall in two days .
