Indian stocks may become more attractive in the new year as fund managers shrug off poor performances this year and dismiss fears of an impending recession , analysts said . 
Bombay &apos;s benchmark index has skidded nearly 30 percent this year but fund managers said cheap valuations would attract fresh money in 1997 despite the controversies that have dogged shaky Indian markets this year . 
&quot; Some people who have already invested may be shy at the beginning of next year , but there will be many new investors who will feel India is a good buy at these levels , &quot; said U.R. 
Bhat , director at Jardine Fleming India Asset Management . 
Bhat said 1996 was an unusual year because a delayed annual budget caused prolonged uncertainty . 
high interest and depreciation charges on capacities that firms had built in the past couple of years hit corporate profitability , he said . 
&quot; commodity cycles were also at their lowest ebb , &quot; he said . 
falling commodity prices , polls in which the dark horse United Front coalition displaced the investor-friendly Congress Party and a delayed federal budget that introduced new taxes on company profits contributed to the gloom . 
but fund managers said they were not disheartened . 
&quot; We have not been too disappointed with the performance of our stocks although the market has not performed that well . 
it &apos;s not an unattractive time to invest but we are fighting against broad sentiment , which is negative , &quot; said a Bombay-based fund manager . 
&quot; We think the fears of a recession are exaggerated . 
in the report , called &quot; Where angels Fear to Tread &quot; , ING Barings said a slowdown in demand coupled with a gloomy capital market and rapidly expanding capacity in most industries would lead to shrinking corporate profitability . 
but Jardine &apos;s Bhat said he saw a brighter picture . 
&quot; Interest rates are falling , the yield gap between debt and equity is at historic lows , the commodity sectors are likely to improve and new capacities will soon be stabilised , &quot; he said . 
a Singapore-based fund manager said India allocations had remained flat in the last quarter of this year . 
&quot; allocations have not been rising too much because sentiment is never positive in a market where people haven &apos;t made money , &quot; he said . 
he said investors were looking for positive signs like a revival in corporate demand for bank credit and a pickup in non-oil imports . 
&quot; We should see signs of recovery in the first quarter of 1997 , &quot; he said .
