the dollar fell on Monday after fears of Japanese trade surpluses took hold and European Union leaders ended a two-week dispute on stabilising budgets for currency union , halting a rally against the German mark . 
the dollar fell more than one yen as the market prepared for swelling Japanese trade deficits to be a major topic of discussion when leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations meet in Denver for a three-day summit on Friday . 
&quot; The summit is this weekend , hence ( the dollar vs. yen ) will probably be more of a focus of trading this week , now that the stability pact is out , &quot; said Stephen Flanagan , a vice president of corporate foreign exchange at Credit agricole Indosuez . 
import / Export data from both Japan and the United States will be released before the gathering . 
figures due Tuesday are expected to show Japan &apos;s trade surplus grew in May , while April U.S. data due Thursday are forecast to reveal the opposite -- a wider deficit . 
dealers are particularly sensitive to trade issues at the moment because of recent signs that the dollar &apos;s rally in 1996 and 1997 has again made U.S. goods more costly in Japan . 
in 1995 , Japan &apos;s swollen trade surplus chilled relations with the United States . 
the market responded by pushing the dollar to record lows , believing Washington tacitly approved of a weak dollar to spur exports . 
&quot; We continue to view dollar / yen as a politically charged currency again . 
any increase in the surplus should bring in selling pressure on dollar / yen , &quot; Flanagan said . 
the dollar fell to 113.43 yen from 114.80 yen on Friday . 
against the mark it retreated more modestly , drifting down to 1.7315 marks from 1.7353 marks Friday . 
a four-day rally against the German currency fizzled when profit-taking set in after EU finance ministers reached a compromise deal on limiting budget deficits after the launch of Europe &apos;s single currency . 
the agreement incorporated French demands for a resolution on employment and economic growth . 
last week , anticipation of an accord bolstered confidence that monetary union would go forward as scheduled in 1999 , helping the dollar by raising the odds the mark would lose its dominant role in Europe to a weaker currency , the euro . 
France and Germany were sharply divided over the issue after France &apos;s new left-wing government balked at signing the pact , negotiated late last year . 
&quot; The stability pact was signed with very little impact in European trading markets . 
( it was ) pretty much as expected , an addendum with jobs was attached to it , &quot; said John Nelson , foreign exchange trading manager at ABN-AMRO Bank . 
in other trading , the dollar eased to 1.4425 Swiss from 1.4429 and rose to Canadian $ 1.3872 from C $ 1.3813 . 
the pound was little changed at $ 1.6375 , compared with $ 1.6373 .
