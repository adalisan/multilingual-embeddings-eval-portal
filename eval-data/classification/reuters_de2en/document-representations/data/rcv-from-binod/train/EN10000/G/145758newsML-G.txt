Lebanon &apos;s newly appointed Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri began consultations on Saturday with parliamentary deputies on forming a new government . 
Hariri , who was appointed on Thursday for a third term of office , must consult all the deputies on the composition of the cabinet . 
he has said he wants to finish consultations on Sunday and political sources expect the new cabinet by mid-week . 
Hariri told a mass meeting of businessmen and politicians on Saturday the new government must work as a team and he would not allow any opposition within the cabinet . 
political sources expected most members of the outgoing 29-member cabinet to be reappointed . 
Hariri , whose previous two governments have wrestled with massive budget deficits , told the mass meeting he would not consider changing a law introduced in 1994 that lowered direct personal and corporate taxes to 10 percent . 
he also said he would tolerate no speculation against the Lebanese pound which has appreciated steadily against the U.S. dollar since he first took office in October 1993 .
