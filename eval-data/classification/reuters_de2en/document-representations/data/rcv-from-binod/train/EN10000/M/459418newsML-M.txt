U.S. spot residual fuel oil prices held steady in thin activity Friday on continued strong interest in high sulphur material in the U.S. Gulf despite sharply lower crude prices . 
&quot; The market was very quiet today , &quot; said a Houston trader . 
in addition to relatively tight spot supply of HSFO in the Gulf , there were concerns over transportation problems along Mississippi River after a barge accident restricted traffic flow since Monday . 
&quot; At this point , most of the barges could go in one direction , down river , &quot; said one Houston cash dealer . 
limited ability to transport resid materials from refiners along the Gulf is expected to aggravate the perceived supply tightness of HSFO , market sources said . 
overall resid demand remained light due to cheap natural gas for industrial consumption and inexpensive spot electricity supplies available to utilities , traders noted . 
NYMEX May crude contract settled down 34 cents at $ 21.51 a bbl after posting a high at $ 22.22 .
