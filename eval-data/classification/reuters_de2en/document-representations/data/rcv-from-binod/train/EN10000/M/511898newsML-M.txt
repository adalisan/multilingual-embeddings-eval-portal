Sweden &apos;s central bank , the Riksbank , said on Tuesday it allocated 11.5 billion crowns into the market in its weekly repurchase operation . 
the one-week straight repo was set at an unchanged fixed rate of 4.10 percent and will run from April 16 to April 23 . 
it was the first week the bank has moved from a repurchase system to a straight repo . 
this means the bank now buys government securities and other valid securities and will put them up for resale on April 23 rather than selling them and then buying them back later . 
the week &apos;s operation replaces a reverse repurchase operation that drained two billion crowns from the market . 
the Riksbank said 39.79 percent of the bids for the new tender were allocated .
