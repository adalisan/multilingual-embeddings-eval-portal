the Chinese yuan closed up slightly on Tuesday at 8.2932 , from Monday &apos;s 8.2935 against the U.S. dollar on Shanghai &apos;s foreign exchange interbank market despite intervention from the central bank , traders said . 
the People &apos;s Bank of China intervened a few minutes before closing to prevent the yuan from rising sharply , they said . 
the yuan opened slightly up at 8.2933 and remained stable around 8.2930 early in the session , touching an intraday low of 8.2935 . 
it then rose steadily and hit a high of 8.2909 in late trading before the central bank &apos;s intervention , traders said . 
trading was more active than on Monday with most transactions done at 8.2928 , traders said . 
one dealer said the intervention depressed the yuan &apos;s uptrend and weakened strong pro-yuan sentiment . 
&quot; The intervention reminds us of a similar move at the same time last year when the central bank made use of thin trading during the holiday to force the yuan down , &quot; he said . 
the market is largely dominated by a holiday mood , with the lunar new year holiday beginning on February 7 , traders said . 
a second dealer said that if the central bank continued to invervene in the market , the yuan &apos;s upward trend of the past few months could come to an end . 
he said he expected the yuan to move around the 8.2930 level on Wednesday . 
the yuan closed up at 6.8000 from 6.8270 against 100 Japanese yen and up slightly at an intraday high of 1.0688 from 1.0693 against the Hong Kong dollar .
