Tokyo yen-based aluminium futures finished mostly firmer after dull trade on Monday , reflecting a slight increase in the metal &apos;s price on the LME during Asian trading hours , traders said . 
&quot; You can &apos;t do anything ( today ) as London and New York are closed on Monday , &quot; said a trader . 
&quot; We &apos;re not really paying attention to aluminium . 
palladium &apos;s moving so much here . 
traders ascribed the small rise in yen-based aluminium contracts to firm LME aluminium quotes during Asian trade . 
the metal was quoted at $ 1,636 / 41 per tonne at 0645 GMT , up from $ 1,633 at the close in London on Friday . 
TOCOM benchmark April 1998 closed 0.7 yen higher at 194.0 yen per kg , while other contracts ranged from 0.3 yen weaker to 1.3 yen higher . 
estimated trade volume was a record low 1,435 lots . 
on Friday in London , aluminium finished unchanged recovering from a mid-afternoon low of $ 1,610 to close at $ 1,633 .
