the FBI ordered a nationwide hunt for a rental truck which it fears is packed with bomb-making ingredients and could be used in an attack similar to the Oklahoma City bombing two years ago , officials said on Monday . 
police said the search was launched after a Texas man reported seeing two men filling containers of diesel fuel at a petrol station near Fort worth on Saturday morning and loading them onto a rental truck which was carrying ammonium nitrate fertiliser . 
those ingredients were used in making the truck bomb which wrecked the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in downtown Oklahoma City on April 19 , 1995 , in which 168 people died . 
FBI sources later said a Fort worth woman called on Monday afternoon to say she believed her husband was driving the truck in question and that his intentions were harmless . 
&quot; The information we have received suggests this might not be such a problem after all , &quot; said one source , although he added that the search for the truck would continue . 
the FBI put out a nationwide terrorist threat advisory and said the truck , which was last seen in the small town of Haltom City near Fort worth , might be carrying 4,500 pounds ( 2,041 kg ) of ammonium nitrate fertiliser and 30 gallons ( 113.6 liters ) of diesel fuel . 
the FBI released a composite sketch of one of the two individuals in the vehicle . 
police Detective Sgt. 
Tony Veltre said it was possible the men in this latest scare were loading up diesel fuel for a long journey . 
&quot; For all I know , they could have been headed for Florida , but we have to be careful . 
FBI officials said they were looking for two men , one in his mid-30s and the other in his mid-50s . 
the FBI was handling the investigation , along with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms . 
at the Justice Department in Washington , Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick said &quot; We put out the threat advisory because we would like the public &apos;s help on this , &quot; Gorelick told reporters . 
&quot; We &apos;re doing this out of an abundance of caution .
