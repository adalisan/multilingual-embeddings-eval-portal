one unknown will be the net income deficit since the Bureau of Statistics will have new data on Q3 foreign investment to plug into its series . 
so far the ABS has only been estimating the net income shortfall based on past trends this could cause revisions to past deficits . 
the makrets are generally comfortable with the deficit at current levels and only a widening to A $ 2.0 billion or more would alarm .
