Iraq said on Sunday it would take whatever action was necessary to stop Turkey from establishing a security buffer zone in its northern Kurdish region . 
&quot; We will take every necessary action in our part to prevent it ( buffer zone ) , &quot; said Hamed Youssef Hummadi , head of the culture and information committee at the Iraqi National Assembly ( parliament ) . 
speaking to reporters , he did not elaborate on whether such action would include military action . 
Hummadi , a former Iraqi culture and information minister , blamed Washington for pushing Ankara into trying to impose the security zone . 
Ankara proposed the temporary zone last week and Washington said it had nothing against the idea . 
&quot; The Turkish government move is prompted by the American government not by the Turkish interest , &quot; Hummadi said . 
his comments were made during a protest in front of the U.N. office in Baghdad , along with Iraq &apos;s speaker of the Assembly Sadoon Hammadi and several members of parliament , against last week &apos;s U.S. missile strikes against Iraq . 
&quot; If the Turkish government insists on that buffer zone and interfering in Iraq &apos;s internal affairs , we think it will not be in the interest of both countries ( Iraq and Turkey ) , &quot; he added . 
Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said on Friday the cordon would deter infiltration from Iraq by guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , fighting for self-rule in Turkey &apos;s Kurdish southeast . 
&quot; If Turkey feels that it has to protect itself it should have that buffer zone in its territory and not in Iraqi territory , &quot; Hummadi said . 
Hummadi welcomed the outcome of the European Union meeting in Ireland which failed to back the United States on its missile strikes against Iraq . 
&quot; The European community ( Union ) meeting did not support the U.S. and the situation in Russia is completely with Iraq ... China and to certain extent France ( are with Iraq ) , &quot; Hummadi said . 
repeating an earlier threat by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein , Hummadi said Iraq would shoot at U.S. planes policing the no-fly zones in southern and northern parts of the country . 
&quot; Now we have announced that their areas ( zones ) are null and void and we will take every apportunity to shoot United States &apos; planes in the whole area , &quot; he said . 
on Saturday Iraq said it had fired missiles at U.S. planes patrolling the no-fly-zones but they missed their targets . 
but Washington could not confirm Baghdad had any fired missiles at its planes . 
the United States and Britain last week declared an extension of the no-fly-zone they have been enforcing along with France in southern Iraq since 1992 , taking its northern limit to the 33rd parallel , 50 km ( 30 miles ) south of Baghdad .
