German call money rates were slightly softer in very quiet trade on Friday , easing back to around 3.03 to 3.08 percent . 
traders said with rates slipping from Thursday &apos;s 3.08 to 3.10 percent , banks were keen to cover liquidity needs cheaply . 
&quot; I have managed to get some quite respectable amounts at a rate of 3.03 percent , &quot; said one trader . 
dealers said rates were likely to remain around these levels for the next few sessions . 
&quot; The market is unlikely to make any dramatic turnaround this afternoon with offers so good this morning , &quot; said one dealer . 
the monthly average for reserves held at the Bundesbank was unchanged on Thursday at 41.1 billion marks . 
despite a slight drop in daily bank reserves held at the central bank -- down to 40.2 billion marks on Thursday from 41.7 billion on Wednesday -- traders said liquidity was easily smooth enough to cope with the muted demand . 
Fiona , the Frankfurt Interbank overnight Averegae , was quoted at 3.09933 percent on Friday , also slightly softer than its Thursday 3.11000 level .
