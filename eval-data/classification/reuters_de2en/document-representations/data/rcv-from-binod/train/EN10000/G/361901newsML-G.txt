a newly-revived rebel organisation which fought Burma &apos;s military rulers in the 1970s and 80s opened a week-long seminar on Thursday to decide on a strategy to make the group strong again . 
about 200 delegates from 17 ethnic rebel factions held talks in Burma &apos;s eastern jungles to figure out ways to resuscitate the National Democratic Front ( NDF ) , formed in the 1970s to fight the military government in Rangoon , an organiser said . 
&quot; The revolutionary groups are discussing how to revive the military operation in order to strengthen our fighting force , &quot; Aung Than Hlay , the meeting host and secretary of the Karenni National Progress Party ( KNPP ) , a small rebel faction , told reporters who visited the area . 
the NDF , an umbrella organisation comprising at least a dozen different ethnic rebel groups in Burma , was formed when the guerrilla war against Rangoon was at its peak and played a major role in unifying disparate guerrilla forces . 
the organisation fell into disarray in 1992 when the Kachin Independence Army ( Kia ) -- one of its key members -- withdrew and signed a peace agreement with Burma &apos;s ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) along with several other factions . 
&quot; Most of the delegates were from those factions who have reached ceasefire with the SLORC who plan to ignore the ceasefire and resume fighting , &quot; Aung Than Hlay said . 
the SLORC says at least 16 rebel factions including the Kia , the United Wa State Army and the mong Tai Army of drug warlord Khun Sa have signed ceasefire deals with the government . 
but the NDF , which held a preliminary meeting in areas controlled by the Karen National Union ( KNU ) last month , said several rebel factions were set to renege on the ceasefire deals and resume fighting . 
the KNU , which was formed in 1948 , is among the world &apos;s oldest rebel organisations . 
it has not signed a ceasefire with the SLORC and has also sent a delegate to the meeting , a KNU source said .
