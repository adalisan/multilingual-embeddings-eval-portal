Canadian bonds closed weaker on Monday , hurt by modest profit-taking , but outperformed their U.S. counterparts , with long-term Canada-U.S. spreads falling to 11-year lows , analysts said . 
&quot; In Canada we are doing much better than U.S. , so the spread continues to improve . 
but with the U.S. market down we can &apos;t escape the force , &quot; said David Yu , a fixed-income portfolio manager with Perigee Investment counsel Inc . 
the U.S. 30-year benchmark fell 14 / 32 to yield 6.79 percent . 
the spread between the benchmark bonds narrowed to 63 basis points from 67 basis points at Friday &apos;s close . 
the spread between Canadian and U.S. benchmark bonds at the 30-year portion of the curve is now the lowest it has been since 1985 . 
analysts said the spread narrowing is the result of Canada &apos;s positive bond market fundamentals , such as low inflation and improving fiscal situation . 
dealers said spreads are expected to narrow even further . 
otherwise , Canadian bonds took their direction largely from the United States , where investors took profits after a sharp rally on Friday , traders said . 
in new issue news , the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce today said it is filing a prospectus for a C $ 250 million debenture issue due October 23 , 2011 in the Canadian markets . 
the bank said the debentures will pay interest twice a year at an annual rate of 7.0 percent until October 23 , 2006 . 
the U.S. 10-year benchmark fell 8 / 32 to yield 6.53 percent . 
the spread between the two benchmark bonds was 25 basis points , unchanged from Friday &apos;s close . 
the three-month cash bill traded at 3.47 percent against the U.S. three-month bill at 5.06 percent .
