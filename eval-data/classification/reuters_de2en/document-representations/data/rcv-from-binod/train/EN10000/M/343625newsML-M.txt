Romania &apos;s foreign exchange market took a step towards ironing out distortions on Thursday when dealers abandoned the use of cross-rates to offer customers more attractive prices . 
the leu was trading directly against the dollar at 5,950 / 980 , for the first time in months only a fraction stronger than cross-rates of 6,050 using currencies like the German mark or Austrian schilling . 
before Thursday &apos;s change of tactics , cross rates had produced a leu-dollar rate of 6,500 this week , considerably weaker than the direct leu-dollar rate . 
&quot; Even though the move will reduce liquidity for a while , it helps the market to get back to normal trading , without back doors , &quot; said one trader . 
Romania &apos;s central bank has pledged to eliminate restrictive practices on the markets as part of its reform programme being worked out with a visiting International Monetary Fund mission . 
the IMF suspended credits to Romania last year after criticising the former leftist government &apos;s curbs aimed at propping the leu &apos;s politically sensitive rate against the dollar before last November &apos;s general election . 
the restrictions cut the market to only four dealer banks which kept leu-dollar rates overvauled . 
but banks ignored the rate and used cross-rates of other currencies to achieve prices closer to the leu &apos;s realistic value . 
but as the new centrist government allowed the leu-dollar interbank rates to fall to more realistic values , that back door had started to have a negative impact on the leu . 
&quot; Using that oportunity had a psychological impact in the past weeks , putting further pressure on the leu and fuelling expectations of even larger falls , &quot; said one trader . 
another trader said cross-quotes had become speculative and had even for the first time fallen below street rates . 
this posed the danger of sending the currency into freefall . 
&quot; Without Thursday &apos;s move , the 300 kilometres to Sofia would seem a very short distance indeed , &quot; he said , referring to the collapse of currency markets in neighbouring Bulgaria . 
traders said the move would help the market to become more integrated . 
but no major changes were expected in the next few months on a market struggling to cope with longstanding hard currency shortages .
