Australian shares ended at a record closing high on Friday in an end-of-year rally helped by two straight gains on Wall Street . 
the key share barometer , the All Ordinaries index ended 14.2 points up at 2,395.6 , eclipsing its previous record close of 2,392.7 set on November 20 . 
the market &apos;s all-time high of 2,408.9 was set on November 26 . 
dealers said few investors took advantage of the stronger sentiment with most fund managers absent from the market after the two-day Christmas break , when the market was closed , and ahead of the weekend . 
&quot; The market fed on itself this afternoon with the few investors around deciding they did not want to miss out on an end-of-year rally , &quot; a Sydney-based dealer said . 
the dealer said the late squeeze was exacerbated by thinness of the market and the reasonable possibility of end-of-quarter window dressing by institutions next Tuesday . 
benefiting most from the market &apos;s rise were bellwether resource issues BHP and WMC while favoured industrial stocks included finance and property group lend lease Corp and beverage company Coca-Cola Amatil . 
dealers said Coca-Cola Amatil stock continued to recover from heavy selling in the past month and a half after it surprised the market with an earnings downgrade in mid-November . 
major banks finished the session mixed with Westpac and National Australia bank closing weaker after both recently paid final dividends .
