Croatia &apos;s central bank sold 161 million kuna in 35- and 91-day liquidity bills on Wednesday , compared to only 43 million at the last weekly auction . 
the rates were flat at 7.50 and 9.0 percent , respectively and there were no bids again for longest 182-day bills . 
Monday &apos;s reserve payment drained a total of 3.39 billion kuna from the banking sector , an official told Reuters . 
this was some 66 million less than under a previous fortnightly requirement as bank accounts sank to a lower level at the end of last week due to tax and benefit payments .
