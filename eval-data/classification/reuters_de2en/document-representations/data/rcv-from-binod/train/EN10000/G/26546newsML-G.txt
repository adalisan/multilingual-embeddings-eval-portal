the White House on Sunday accused Bob Dole &apos;s presidential campaign of &quot; grasping &quot; in demanding the release of President Clinton &apos;s medical records , and said Clinton has made public more health data than Dole had provided . 
&quot; The Dole campaign , frankly , is just grasping at anything they can find . 
you know , when you &apos;re 20 points behind ( in the polls ) or 10 points behind or however far behind they are , I guess that &apos;s what you do , &quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry said . 
the matter of Clinton &apos;s medical records arose because of questions about a small but noticeable growth on the side of the president &apos;s neck . 
McCurry reminded reporters that the growth was diagnosed as a &quot; benign inclusion cyst &quot; when Clinton , 50 , had his annual medical checkup in May . 
Clinton &quot; has an ingrown pimple that &apos;s not a problem , &quot; McCurry said , adding that it will be removed at some point on an outpatient basis . 
McCurry said Clinton , as a candidate for president in 1992 , had given the public &quot; more complete medical information ... than Senator Dole has released to date . 
&quot; We are not going to make health an issue in this campaign , nor will we make age an issue in this campaign , &quot; the White House spokesman said . 
dole , 73 , is the oldest candidate ever to seek a first term as president .
