the New York State Senate Majority Leader said Friday he would not back down in a fight to end rent controls despite death threats and a police probe of two suspicious fires next to his district office . 
&quot; I will not be intimidated , I will not react to threats , and anyone that knows me knows I &apos;ve led most of life getting things done the hard way , and this is no exception . 
we &apos;re going to get this down . 
we &apos;re going to transition out of rent control , we &apos;re going to do it in a reasonable , responsible way , &quot; Joseph Bruno , R-Troy , told reporters in Albany . 
Bruno said the police believed arson was involved in two fires that broke out across from the entrance to his district office in Saratoga , one a little before 1800 EDT Thursday , and one at about 0030 EDT , adding the fires had been linked them to a bomb threat . 
the office is located in a building that has apartments that Bruno said were occupied . 
the fight over rent controls , which mainly affect New York City residents because it has most of the state &apos;s rent-regulated apartments , is one of the major issues delaying the Senate , the Democrat-led Assembly and Gov. 
George Pataki , a Republican , from agreeing a new budget , which already is 11 days late . 
the battle over the budget might not be resolved until around June 15 , when the rent control rules expire unless new legislation is approved . 
Bruno reiterated that he was prepared to see the rules expire if a phase-out of the regulations had not been agreed by then . 
he added it would be futile for the Senate to approve a bill that would extend rent controls for disabled and senior citizens -- even though that was a protection he has proposed -- because the Assembly , which wants the rules fully extended , would not be satisfied . 
the Senate Majority Leader said he held tenant advocates and a few of the Democrat Assemblymen who oppose his plans to phase-out rent controls accountable because they had used inflammatory language in expressing their views . 
&quot; I hold them acountable , not specifically , but because of the things they say and how they say them , &quot; Bruno told reporters , saying he had been called a demon and that for months he had been getting threatening letters , which he had turned over to the police . 
threatening phone calls and letters had been traced by the police to New York City , Bruno said , adding he had cautioned his wife not to open bulky packages , especially if they were sent from the city . 
while security has been beefed up , Bruno said he was &quot; pretty much &quot; able to follow his normal schedule , and did not have a police guard at home even though callers and letter writers had contacted him there , as well at his offices in Saratoga and Albany . 
his staff also has gotten threatening phone calls , some in the middle of the night , he said .
