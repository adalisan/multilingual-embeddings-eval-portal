Tokyo stocks ended mixed in directionless trade on Wednesday with the key Nikkei edging up slightly . 
after an initial dip at the open on Wall Street &apos;s losses , buying was limited to selected blue-chip issues , while the recent fall in other issues lost momentum , brokers said . 
the key Nikkei 225 average inched up 29.35 points or 0.14 percent to finish at 20,659.91 . 
but its December futures closed 10 points lower at 20,650 . 
&quot; No fresh money seemed to flow into the market , and I expect the downside to become vulnerable , &quot; said Masaaki Higashida , strategist at Nomura Securities Co Ltd .
