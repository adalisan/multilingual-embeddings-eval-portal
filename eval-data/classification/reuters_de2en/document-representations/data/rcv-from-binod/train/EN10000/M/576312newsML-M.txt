&quot; technically , the market looks good but fundamentally , I &apos;m not quite sure , &quot; a floor source said , noting record U.S. and Brazilian crops anticipated in 1997 / 98 amid sluggish demand for orange juice . 
USDA today put the 1996 / 97 Florida crop at a record 224.2 million 90-lb boxes , compared with the the previous estimate of 221.1 million boxes , which was also a record crop . 
yields were raised to 1.58 gallons per box from 1.57 gallons . 
the report was expected to to pressure the market to contract lows as it belied analysts &apos; expectations for an unchanged report .
