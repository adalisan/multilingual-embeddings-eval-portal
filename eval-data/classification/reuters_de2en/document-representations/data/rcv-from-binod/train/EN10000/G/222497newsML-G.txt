a leading Bulgarian actress has decided to take her compatriots &apos; minds off the economic crisis by having a plaster cast of her breasts made for display in the National Theatre . 
&quot; I was fed up with constant comments on the currency board so I said one day let &apos;s talk busts instead of boards , &quot; National Theatre actress Anya Pencheva told the daily 24 Hours in an interview published on Thursday . 
Bulgaria is discussing the pros and cons of a strict monetary regime which would effectively peg the collapsing Lev to the dollar , bringing with it severe budget spending cuts . 
&quot; It is a pity to focus everything on the ( currency ) board when there are such beautiful breasts around , &quot; said Pencheva , who is also a long-standing local sex symbol .
