NYMEX crude ended in a wider contango Tuesday as talk of imports flooding the U.S. Gulf persisted amid lacklustre crude demand , traders said . 
&quot; There are so many imports being unloaded , so I expected the contango to widen to 20 cents . 
crude didn &apos;t fall anymore than it did only because losses in London weren &apos;t so bad , &quot; said Michael Busby , trader with Northville Industries in Melville , New York . 
April crude ended off 38 cents a barrel at $ 20.11 . 
April heating oil settled off 0.25 cent at 52.83 cents a gallon while April gasoline finished off 0.50 cent at 63.86 cents a gallon . 
the April / May crude carry widened to 18 cents from four cents Monday when prompt crude slipped into contango for the first time since May 1995 . 
Contango signifies the front month being cheaper than the back month . 
traders said the widening contango may begin offering an opportunity for dealers to store spot crude and pay for the storage costs with the more expensive back months . 
this could result in increased stocks , driving prices even lower , dealers noted . 
but , April Brent ended only four cents off at $ 19.24 a barrel on London &apos;s IPE , keeping April crude on NYMEX above technical support of around $ 20.00 . 
the two crudes tend to track the value of the other as dealers trade the difference between the two or their &quot; spread . 
on March 3 , April crude fell to $ 19.96 , a nine-month low for prompt crude which became key support when it rebounded from that level . 
crude prices are sagging under an influx of imports , particularly from West Africa , and low demand due to refinery maintenance . 
in fact , the increase in imports and relatively low crude runs is expected to result in a build in crude stocks of around 3.5 million barrels in the weekly oil inventory report from the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) due out Wednesday . 
the report reflects the week ended March 7 . 
dealers said part of crude &apos;s losses were due to the market &apos;s discounting wide expectations for the build .
