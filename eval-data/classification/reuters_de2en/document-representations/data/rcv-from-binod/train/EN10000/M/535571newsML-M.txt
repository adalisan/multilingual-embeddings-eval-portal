Asia Pacific oil market is still in its infancy in using futures and derivatives for trading and risk management purposes compared to its Western counterparts , according to a survey published in Singapore . 
the survey , received by Reuters on Thursday , was conducted jointly by the Singapore Monetary Exchange ( SIMEX ) energy committee and the Singapore &apos;s Trade Development Board . 
according to the survey , covering nearly 100 Singapore based oil companies in late 1996 , the ratio of futures and paper oil trades to the underlying physical oil demand for Europe and North America was about four and 10 times respectively . 
but in the Asia Pacific region , this ratio was less than one time , it said . 
the survey said Singapore was still predominantly a physical oil market , where real cargoes of oil were bought and sold . 
but in the North American and European market , futures and derivatives trading were already very well-established , it said . 
the survey said some 11 million barrels -- 5.8 million barrels of crude oil and 5.2 million of refined petroleum products -- were traded each day out of Singapore . 
of the 11 million barrels , 10.5 million barrels went to meet the Asia-Pacific &apos;s oil demand of 17.3 million barrels . 
while Singapore has a refining capacity of 1.3 million bpd , domestic consumption is only at 600,000 bpd . 
based on the survey , only some 1.5 million barrels of crude-oil , and 3.5 million barrels of refined petroleum products were traded each day in the derivatives , or &quot; paper &quot; market . 
&quot; Physical crude oil traded in Singapore was some 5.8 million barrels per day ( in the fourth quarter of 1996 ) compared with Singapore &apos;s refining capacity of 1.2 million barrels per day . 
participants in the Singapore oil market trade substantially for their overseas associates .
