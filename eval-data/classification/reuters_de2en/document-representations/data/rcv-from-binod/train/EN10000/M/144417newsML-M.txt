world copper prices broke above the crucial $ 2,000-a-tonne barrier for the first time in seven weeks late on Thursday , and with visible stocks tumbling , the potential for further rallies looks good . 
in fact many floor traders on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) are surprised the price rise has not extended further , given that copper stocks have dropped 60 percent from the year &apos;s peak to just 145,825 tonnes . 
one more big drawdown on Tuesday next week would take the total to the lowest level for over six years . 
&quot; comparing total stocks to prices ( over the last fifteen years ) we estimate that the price of copper should be $ 1.10 per pound ( $ 2,425 / tonne ) , &quot; said Wiktor Bielski , analyst at bain and Co , part of Deutche Morgan Grenfell . 
he estimated total stocks at around 3.5 weeks &apos; consumption , not far above the all-time low of 3.1 weeks &apos; . 
but Bielski explained there were special factors in play which are limiting the market &apos;s upside potential . 
one was the perception that long positions were still being unwound by banks who took over Sumitomo Corp &apos;s massive exposure in the wake of the copper trading loss scandal . 
another was complacency about new supplies coming on stream next year from big mine expansions . 
&quot; In fact , looking into 1997 , I don &apos;t think the market will be that far away from balance , &quot; Bielski said . 
floor traders added that there was a big question mark over whether the copper moving out of LME warehouses was being consumed or merely shifted to consumers &apos; yards in Europe , warehouses in China and to the U.S. and Japan . 
but physical merchants were confident that copper offtake was picking up , justifying the decline in inventories . 
&quot; We are seeing good business in the U.S. , good business in the Far East and a shortage of scrap forcing people to take more LME material as a substitue , &quot; said one European merchant . 
and of the 40,000 tonnes going to China , the merchant estimated only 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes was likely to find its way back into LME warehouses in Singapore . 
other dampeners on the copper price were influential short position holders trying to protect their exposure and producers selling into rallies in case the market collapses , traders said . 
joining copper on its upward path this week has been aluminium , the second most heavily-traded of the LME contracts . 
from a 2-1 / 2 year low of $ 1,305 a tonne earlier this month prices have recovered over 10 percent to a six-week high of $ 1,441 early on Friday . 
tightening nearby supplies and modest fund buying were behind the move , further boosted by market rumours that the six signatories to a 1994 production-cutting pact may be considering renewing the agreement to boost prices . 
but Canadian sources in Moscow denied such intentions on Friday , knocking values off the highs . 
elsewhere on the commodity markets , wheat prices took a dive in Chicago on Thursday on a surprise hike in the EU &apos;s export subsidy for wheat and dismal weekly U.S. wheat export sales . 
December wheat closed down 14-1 / 2 cents per bushel to $ 3.84 , just above a half the value during the price spike in March .
