Philippine rebel leader Nur Misuari formally entered mainstream political life on Monday by voting in elections where he is the sole candidate for the governorship of a Moslem autonomous regional government . 
the former university professor turned revolutionary is running for the governorship of the Autonomous Region of Moslem Mindanao ( ARMM ) , which covers just four southern provinces . 
as the only candidate for governor , all Misuari needs is one vote -- either his own or that of one of his two wives -- to claim victory in the elections , poll officials said . 
&quot; This vote symbolises our commitment to peace , democracy and progress for our people here in Mindanao and eventually for the entire country , &quot; said Misuari , who signed a peace deal with the government last week ending a 24-year separatist war in the southern Philippines . 
in a live nationwide broadcast , Philippine television showed Misuari casting his ballot at a school in his home town of Jolo on the island of Sulu . 
Misuari said he believed the elections would be the most peaceful in Philippine history and said there had been no trouble even in areas notorious for violence . 
&quot; So far , some of the most volatile areas have proven to be very , very peaceful , &quot; Misuari told reporters . 
it was expected to take a week for Manila to ratify the election results , one official said . 
also at stake are the post of vice governor and all seats in a 21-member regional legislative assembly . 
under his peace deal with Manila , Misuari will also head a Southern Philippine Council for Peace and Development covering the whole of the main southern island of Mindanao and nearby islands . 
the council , bitterly opposed by some southern Philippine Christians , is envisaged as the precursor of a much wider autonomous regional government covering 14 provinces on the main southern island of Mindanao and adjacent islands . 
Misuari and the Moro National Liberation Front which he heads had previously refused to have anything to do with the ARMM , denouncing it as a sham . 
but he agreed to stand for election now to demonstrate his administrative skills and to reassure Christians . 
many Christians have opposed the deal , fearing it would lead to MNLF political ascendancy in a region Moslems regard as their ancestral homeland but in which Christian settlers now dominate by a ratio of three to one . 
Christian vigilante groups have been formed to oppose the pact by violence , but military officials dismiss them as insignificant . 
the election will complete the return to the government fold of the quietly-spoken , low-key Misuari who launched a bloody revolt for Moslem self-rule in the Mindanao region in 1972 . 
the uprising cost more than 120,000 lives .
