a growing list of Brent crude sellers lined up to court U.S. refiners on the Gulf Coast on Friday amid a slight narrowing of the transatlantic arbitrage , traders said . 
the North Sea bellwether crude was on offer at 65 cents a barrel under West Texas Intermediate / Cushing for July delivery , up five cents from earlier in the week . 
a U.S. company sold a 500,000 barrel Brent cargo to a U.S. refiner on Thursday at WTI minus 65 cents , confirming the new price level . 
the dated Brent price continued to slide on Friday , fetching 30 cents under the July Brent quote for loading June 12-14 . 
healthy U.S. refining margins and tepid demand in Europe and the Far East encouraged several other companies to test the waters for bringing Brent across the Atlantic , traders said . 
still , one major U.S. buyer suggested that the weakening price for domestic alternative Light Louisiana sweet crude diminished Brent &apos;s local appeal . 
&quot; It &apos;s going to be tough for these cargoes to compete with LLS , &quot; the buyer said . 
meanwhile , a distressed cargo of Saharan Blend was still looking for a home around $ 1.25 under WTI / Cushing for early June delivery , traders said . 
among West African activity , a trading house was offering Nigerian Forcados for July 15-20 delivery , asking August WTI / Cushing minus 10-20 cents a barrel . 
in Latin America , Colombian Cusiana was assessed around $ 1.45 a barrel , down 10 cents from the last deal on Wednesday .
