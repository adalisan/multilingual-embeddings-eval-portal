Jakarta stocks close sharply lower after a volatile day on Tuesday on concerns over tight liquidity after the central bank raised interest rates , brokers said . 
the Jakarta composite index closed down 1.52 percent , or 9.11 points , at 590.53 points after falling at the open , then rising to a high of 612.21 points and plunging to an intra-day low of 585.58 points after news of the central bank move . 
in the broader market , losers led gainers by 98 to 39 , with 52 counters unchanged . 
total volume was estimated at 920 billion rupiah . 
&quot; The central bank &apos;s move had sparked selling , particularly in banking stocks , on perceptions that their earnings could be affected , &quot; a broker with a European securities firm said . 
although the rupiah had strengthened in late trade on foreign buying , the sharp fall in stocks was due to fluctuations in the currency market and concerns over the moves to tighten liquidity , he added . 
&quot; The rise in the interest rates has helped the currency but it hasn &apos;t done much for the stock market , &quot; said Tom Inglis , head of research for ING Barings in Jakarta . 
&quot; uncertainties in the currency and the interest rates will keep equities nervous . 
however , brokers said , some investors had used the opportunity to accumulate stocks because many of them had reached favourable prices . 
brokers predicted market sentiment would remain volatile on Wednesday on extended fluctuations in the currency market coupled with concern over tight liquidity . 
but , at the same time , more bargain-hunters were likely to come in , they said . 
&quot; The potential downside of the composite index is still there but not by too much . 
our market is already undervalued , I don &apos;t believe it will go down further , &quot; a broker with a Malaysia-based brokerage said . 
&quot; This is the right time to buy . 
banking stocks including Bank International Indonesia , Bank Negara Indonesia , Lippo Bank and Bank Danamon ended lower . 
market heavyweight Telkom and toll road operator Citra Marga were also down due to extended fluctuation in the rupiah , brokers said . 
Telkom was last traded at 3,500 rupiah , or down 125 rupiah , on a volume of 20.2 million shares , while Citra Marga fell 25 rupiah to close at 1,075 rupiah on a volume of 26.4 million shares . 
but cement counter semen Gresik was favoured by buyers on perceptions that its price was cheap , brokers said . 
it closed 175 rupiah higher at 3,200 rupiah on turnover of 6.1 million shares .
