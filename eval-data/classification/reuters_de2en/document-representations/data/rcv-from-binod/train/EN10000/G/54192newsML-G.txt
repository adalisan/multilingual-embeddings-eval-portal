anyone seeking a souvenir of the event Umberto Bossi says will go down in history has plenty to choose from along the banks of the River Po where the Italian secessionist leader is staging his &quot; March to the Sea &quot; . 
Bossi &apos;s Northern League party declares that Sunday &apos;s planned proclamation of independence for the self-styled &quot; Padania &quot; is on a par with the U.S. declaration of independence in 1776 . 
to prove it , the would-be state has issued its own &quot; greenback &quot; -- a green 500,000 lire ( $ 327 ) note bearing a picture of Bossi issued in the name of the &quot; Bank of the Free and Independent Padania &quot; . 
Green is the Northern League &apos;s colour . 
witnesses at Friday &apos;s start of the campaign at the source of the Po high in the Italian Alps had the chance to stock up on &quot; Padanian &quot; Alpine hats . 
or why not purchase a green shirt , the uniform of Bossi &apos;s volunteer security detail ? 
Party officials were doing a brisk trade in special souvenir short-sleeved versions at 30,000 lire ( $ 20 ) a go at the riverside in Cremona on Saturday . 
or celebrate the &quot; birth &quot; of their &quot; nation &quot; with pink confetti . 
Bossi , who says millions of his supporters will turn out on Sunday at the end of his journey along Italy &apos;s longest river to watch him read his symbolic declaration of independence , has already told everyone present they are making history with him . 
die-hard supporters who vote for independence on Sunday at a special ritual will get to keep half of their voting slips . 
the League promises that all the other half-slips will be collected and immortalised in a cement monument to be placed outside the League &apos;s self-styled parliament of the north in Mantua . 
but another chance to leave a personal mark by signing an independence visitors book drew few takers . 
only a couple of pages -- at about 100 signatures per page -- were full . 
Bossi has glossed over suggestions that few Italians actually share his aim of separating the wealthy industrial north from the poorer , more agricultural south . 
the latest opinion poll put the figure at only 7.6 percent with 85.6 percent against . 
he has pressed on , swearing that only secession will cut Italy &apos;s richest region loose from southern leeches sapping its potential with high taxes , bureaucracy and state inefficiency . 
but Prime Minister Romano Prodi was among those on Saturday who expressed concern at the hype and artifice surrounding Padania , a concept he said was &quot; so little shared by the people &quot; . 
Bossi &apos;s supporters might stock up on celebration fake stamps in anticipation of the firebrand leader &apos;s promise to turn &quot; Padania &quot; into a reality within a year , but the truth is that no-one knows where the &quot; state &quot; is and it has no proper identity . 
the Bossi banknotes bore inscriptions in the Lombardy dialect which is spoken in parts of the north but is not the lingua franca of all the League leader &apos;s would-be citizens . 
Bossi says he wants northern Italy to be allowed to join a single European currency on its own but no-one yet has any clear idea of where &quot; Padania &quot; begins and ends . 
some supporters would like to see it stretch as far south as Florence . 
but on Saturday he urged followers -- some of whom waved banners revering him as a god or a king -- to relax and enjoy the party . 
some took him up on the offer , paying 65,000 lire ( $ 42 ) to travel with him down the Po in a catamaran .
