poor hygiene and lack of basic medical equipment means there could be many more new outbreaks in Africa of the terrifying Ebola virus , an expert said on Friday . 
&quot; There are thousands of Kikwits waiting to happen , &quot; South African Robert Swanepoel said referring to the Zairean town of Kikwit where Ebola fever killed 244 people last year . 
Swanepoel , representing the Johannesburg Institute of virology at a three-day colloquium on Ebola virus research , said the lack of basic protective gear such as gloves in most African hospitals was bound to cause new outbreaks of the killer virus . 
&quot; As many hospitals as there are in rural Africa , that &apos;s how many chances there are of having such an outbreak , &quot; he told Reuters in an interview . 
Ebola , which kills between seven and eight out of 10 victims , was named after a river in northern Zaire where it first appeared in 1976 . 
the virus , which spreads through contact with infected blood or bodily fluids , causes massive internal bleeding leading to a painful death . 
there is no known cure . 
Swanepoel said that during previous outbreaks in Africa hospital staff re-used disposable needles and syringes &quot; just rinsing them with water or a little bit of useless disinfectant . 
&quot; This lack of gloves , lack of means of applying hygiene must be happening all over Africa on a large scale , &quot; he said . 
the international community responded to the Kikwit outbreak by sending tonnes of protective gear to the town but Swanepoel , who has repeatedly carried out research in Kikwit , said it was just stockpiled there until it would become useless . 
&quot; The trouble is that the next outbreak might be 1,000 kilometres away or in another country and stocks sitting in Kikwit are not going to do anyone any good , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The next time it happens , we &apos;re again not going to be prepared , &quot; he said . 
he said the response to an outbreeak generally came too late . 
experts at the colloquium said most outbreaks had been halted mainly by basic public health precautions such as isolating victims . 
Swanepoel said equipment had to be be distributed much quicker and in a more sensible way , but sounded pessimistic the situation would improve . 
&quot; It &apos;s either they got nothing or when they get an outbreak they get a mountain of stuff . 
it &apos;s the continuity that &apos;s the problem and to that I don &apos;t see the answer , &quot; he said . 
transport in general in Africa was a problem with a number of roads in a worse shape than years ago , he said . 
&quot; ( During an outbreak ) do you think ( protective gear ) will get right to Kikwit or all other Kikwits ? 
with what ? 
&quot; he said . 
&quot; And even the stuff we brought in ourselves ... the next day some of it was on sale in the markets in town .
