Thailand &apos;s only married orangutan couple are now the happy parents of a male baby ape . 
Zuzu , an eight-year old orangutan who made headlines last year when she was flown from Taiwan to marry Mike -- a lonely ape who needed a mate -- in an elaborate traditional ceremony , gave birth to a 1.1 kg ( 2.42 lb ) baby late on Tuesday night . 
the delivery , expected for weeks , took place at Lopburi zoo , 120 km ( 70 miles ) north of Bangkok . 
hundreds of people have flocked to the zoo , Thailand &apos;s oldest , over the past few weeks with the hope of seeing Zuzu give birth . 
&quot; We had champagne and a big celebration last night , &quot; said Dr Kurpih Pei , a Taiwanese who exported Zuzu to Thailand and came to look after her during her delivery .
