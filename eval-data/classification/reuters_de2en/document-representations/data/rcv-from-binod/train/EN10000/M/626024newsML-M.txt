White sugar futures managed to hold onto most of their earlier trade-fuelled buying gains on Friday despite a bout of profit-taking at the highs , traders said . 
concern over seasonal tightness has prompted trade players to buy into the spot month amid market fears of reduced supply between the tail-end of the European crop and the start of the 1997 / 98 campaign . 
little interest was reported in the August / July arbitrage , whose nominal value is gradually widening as the whites edge higher . 
but with July raws expected to ease as funds move out of the position and Brazilians price sugars from around 11.30 cents / lb , the differential should widen further from its current level of $ 76 . 
&quot; Even if you bought the premium at this high level , I think you &apos;d still make money on it because I don &apos;t think the whites will come down , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; You &apos;ve got to be long of the spread and be long of the whites in general because it &apos;s going to be steady for the next couple of months . 
at 1550 GMT August was up 20 cents at $ 324.10 and October up 50 cents at $ 314.10 . 
volume was 1,736 lots , most of which was in the spot month . 
Paris volume was subdued at just 284 lots . 
August was up 60 cents at $ 324.00 and October up $ 2.40 at $ 314.90 .
