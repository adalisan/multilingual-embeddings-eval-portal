the Alice springs to Darwin rail link was a step closer following the federal government &apos;s 1997 / 98 budget announcement of new infrastructure bonds and a special Federation fund for capital works , South Australian state Premier John Olsen said on Wednesday . 
&quot; It is quite feasible that tracks could be laid next year if private investment can now be found to match this encouragement from Canberra , &quot; he said in a statement , adding he had been encouraged by the level of support from potential investors during his recent visit to Hong Kong and Japan . 
Olsen said the infrastructure bonds would help attract the extra A $ 500-600 million from private investors needed to complete the rail link , and he would make urgent representations to Canberra to ensure the link was included as one of the major projects to mark the centenary of Australia &apos;s federation in 2001 .
