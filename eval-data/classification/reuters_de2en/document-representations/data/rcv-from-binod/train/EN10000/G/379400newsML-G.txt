Streaky asked Val to marry him , Chochy told Plop that he loved her -- or she loved him -- more than life itself and Boldheart informed Susan she was pure gold and that every one of her carats was perfection . 
some messages were fairly conventional -- Paul told Mary , the girl in the sports car , that he would love her forever . 
others were odder -- Swanvester informed Casper : &quot; truly yours &apos; til ducks grow mudguards . 
even the businesslike Financial Times turned over one of its pink pages to Valentine &apos;s Day messages . 
&quot; To my Eurobond dealer , come home tonight and bond with me , &quot; read one . 
Valentine &apos;s Day is big business in Britain . 
fashionable London restaurants have been taking bookings for weeks , with romantic tables for two almost unobtainable and special menus on offer at double the price of a normal meal . 
&quot; Romance is most certainly not dead and there will be plenty of credit-card bills next month to prove it , &quot; said the Evening Standard newspaper . 
British Airways said it had flown in one million roses for Valentine &apos;s Day from Miami , Bogota and Nairobi . 
Eurostar laid on a jazz band to serenade passengers heading though the Channel Tunnel , while one couple was getting married at Ashford International station before heading off on the train to Paris for their honeymoon . 
for lovers stuck in England , a suburban London station was announcing romantic messages over the public address system usually used to give notice of train delays . 
&quot; We are delighted to play Cupid and broadcast mystery messages in between more conventional station announcements , &quot; said announcer Louise Cooper , who is offering a bottle of champagne as a prize for the oddest declaration of love . 
and for the curious , private detectives are being hired for up to 500 pounds ( $ 800 ) a case to track down anonymous senders of Valentine cards , The Times newspaper reported . 
engaged by people worried they might be missing what could be a beautiful romance , they use modern surveillance technology and handwriting analysis to track down senders . 
the Times also reported that an increasing number of animal lovers were buying Valentine cards for their pets . 
there was however no indication that the furry creatures were employing private eyes to find out where the cards had come from .
