Argentine bonds were higher late Monday after a calm session in which players edged towards the conviction that the market has discounted a possible hike in U.S. rates . 
&quot; It is very possible that the market has now discounted a hike in the U.S. , &quot; said a trader at a local brokerage house . 
the U.S. Federal Reserve &apos;s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday . 
Argentina &apos;s FRB due 2005 rose 5 / 8 to 90-7 / 8 , while the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 was up $ 0.30 to 127.00 . 
&quot; The market was just waiting , &quot; said another trader , pointing to the thin activity as players stayed on the sidelines in anticipation of news from the Federal Reserve . 
traders and analysts said the biggest surprise element for the market would be if the Federal Reserve did nothing at Tuesday &apos;s meeting . 
no action could raise fears that monetary policy will have to be tightened more later in the year . 
but whatever happens , traders said the anticipated upgrade in Argentina &apos;s credit rating could very well outweigh any negative news from the U.S. 
call money rates fell to 5.80 percent from 5.88 percent .
