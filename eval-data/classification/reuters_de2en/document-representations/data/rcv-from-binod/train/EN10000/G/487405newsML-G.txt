a former Argentine Navy officer , notorious for his confessions about the military &apos;s &quot; dirty War &quot; in the late 1970s , confirmed on Friday a press report that secret files on the victims were hidden in a Swiss bank . 
Spanish newspaper El Mundo &apos;s report that the Argentine military smuggled out files on tens of thousands of people who &quot; disappeared &quot; during the 1976-83 dictatorship has raised hopes that the truth about their deaths may finally be known . 
the Argentine government has requested information from Madrid about eight green tin trunks reportedly flown to Madrid in 1983 , copied onto microfilm by Spanish intelligence , then taken to a bank vault in Switzerland . 
former navy officer Adolfo Scilingo &apos;s confession in 1995 about his role in flights over the River plate when thousands of people were thrown to their deaths triggered a wave of &quot; mea culpas &quot; from the security forces . 
he told Argentine radio on Friday : &quot; I knew the documents were in Switzerland . 
they were taken there in 1983 by orders of the then commander-in-chief of the Navy , Admiral Ruben Franco . 
the files were filmed and they took three copies of the microfilm . 
&quot; Those documents are very important because each file has records on every person detained . 
they will show what was the motive of each &apos; disappearance &apos; and there will be a lot of surprises about how many innocent people there were , &quot; he said . 
after the Argentine military took power in a coup in 1976 , they waged a brutal campaign on leftist guerrillas and anyone remotely suspected of sympathising , even schoolchildren . 
human rights groups say up to 30,000 people were abducted and killed . 
many bodies were never found . 
their relatives , led by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo , have long insisted there must be files on where and when they were killed and by whom . 
&quot; It &apos;s fantastic that this should come to light , but what worries me is they will want to certify the deaths of the disappeared whereas what we want to know is who killed them , &quot; said Mothers &apos; leader Hebe de Bonafini . 
Undersecretary for Human Rights Alicia Pierini wrote in Clarin newspaper of &quot; new hopes raised by the Spanish press report about documents recording the horrors suffered by Argentine society . 
&quot; She said the government of President Carlos Menem , who freed all dirty War criminals with a pardon in 1989 , would &quot; do the impossible &quot; to get hold of such files . 
but the military questioned details of El Mundo &apos;s story and called it an attempt by the Spanish left to sabotage Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar &apos;s visit to Argentina on April 20 . 
&quot; What is the aim of publishing this 21 years later ? 
if the lists exist they should have been published in 1983 , &quot; said one military source .
