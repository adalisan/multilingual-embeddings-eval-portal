Zaire &apos;s ailing and embattled President Mobutu Sese Seko headed back to his capital on Saturday after agreeing to face-to-face talks with rebel leader Laurent Kabila for Wednesday . 
after meeting with Mobutu , South African Vice-President Thabo Mbeki said both Kabila and Mobutu had now agreed to a second meeting that would discuss Mobutu &apos;s role . 
&quot; Both of them have agreed to meet on Wednesday on the boat , &quot; Mbeki told reporters in the Gabonese capital Libreville on the latest step of a hectic diplomatic shuttle in the region . 
a first ship-borne session between the civil war foes hosted by South Africa &apos;s Nelson Mandela ended inconclusively last weekend in Congo . 
Mobutu left Libreville in his presidential Boeing 727 , witnesses said . 
the airport control tower said the plane had filed a flight plan showing it bound for Kinshasa . 
bill Richardson , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said he still believed a peaceful transition in Zaire was possible but any new government would &quot; most likely &quot; be headed by Kabila in light of his military victories . 
he said the transitional phase should include various factions . 
&quot; The big issue is going to be how much of Mobutu &apos;s people , if any at all , are part of that , &quot; he said . 
Richardson also said a peaceful handover would require another face-to-face meeting between Kabila and Mobutu . 
&quot; A lot of posturing takes place , &quot; he said in a television interview . 
&quot; I believe that Mobutu will return to Kinshasa before he heads for the Congo . 
but eventually I do believe there &apos;s still a good chance of a peaceful inclusive transition government . 
rebels said they had pushed Mobutu &apos;s army 50 km ( 30 miles ) beyond their previous outpost at Kenge , 200 km ( 125 miles ) east of Kinshasa in heavy fighting . 
it was not clear when the fighting took place . 
it was not possible to verify rebel claims , which in the past have often proved false . 
rebel &quot; foreign minister &quot; Bizima Karaha told Reuters Angolan UNITA troops , who fought a 20-year civil war against the government with backing from Washington and Mobutu , were helping the Zaire army . 
Western intelligence sources say Angola , and Zaire &apos;s eastern neighbours Uganda and Rwanda give military help to Kabila . 
Richardson said the Angolans needed &quot; to step aside ... They &apos;ve got , unfortunately , some negative intentions in terms of moving their troops into Zaire to pay back Mobutu . 
Mobutu , 66 , dominated the mineral-rich country at the heart of Africa for more than three decades until prostate cancer and the rebellion , launched in October , loosened his hold . 
in Gabon , he met several French-speaking African presidents who urged Zaire &apos;s parliament to play a role in ending the war . 
but Karaha called the proposal &quot; absolute nonsense &quot; and said Mobutu would be chased away if he was still in Kinshasa when rebels arrived . 
Karaha demanded power be handed directly to &quot; President &quot; Kabila . 
in seven months , the rebels , initially a small force fighting for ethnic Tutsis , have won control of around three quarters of the vast country . 
Richardson warned Kabila to ensure his troops stopped mistreating Rwandan Hutu refugees and punished those responsible for alleged refugee massacres in eastern Zaire if he wanted respect from the international community .
