the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday it was resuming lending to Pakistan with an extended and expanded stand-by credit . 
the IMF said in a statement it had agreed to Pakistan &apos;s request to extend the $ 600 million loan to September from March and to increase it by $ 231 million . 
the money will be used to help Pakistan restructure its economy and bring it into better balance . 
the decision is a vote of confidence in Pakistan &apos;s caretaker government , which took power last month after President Farooq Leghari sacked Benazir Bhutto amid charges of corruption . 
the IMF had withheld two $ 80 million disbursements of the stand-by loan due in June and September because it was unhappy with the performance of Pakistan &apos;s economy and the government &apos;s 1996 / 97 budget plans . 
since then , the country has worked hard to get back into the IMF &apos;s good graces through a series of measures aimed at reforming and stabilising the economy . 
the economy is projected to expand by five percent in 1996 / 97 , after growing by 6.1 percent the previous year , the IMF said . 
inflation is seen rising to 11 percent from eight . 
&quot; The authorities have adopted a stabilisation package consisting of a reduction in the budget deficit , an increase in interest rates and a depreciation of the exchange rate , &quot; the IMF said . 
that will be backed up by &quot; far-reaching &quot; structural economic reforms , including improvement of the banking sector and rationalisation of government expenditures , it added . 
Shahid Javed Burki , an adviser to the Pakistan government , briefed the IMF board on the country &apos;s economic efforts at an informal meeting last Friday . 
besides agreeing to expand and extend the existing stand-by credit , the IMF has left open the possibility of negotiating a separate , low-cost loan with the nation in 1997 . 
that credit would come from the IMF &apos;s Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility , which lends money to poor countries at just a half percent interest charge .
