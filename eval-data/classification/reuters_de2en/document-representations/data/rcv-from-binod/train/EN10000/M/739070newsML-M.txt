following is the China Interbank offered Rate ( CHIBOR ) for Friday issued by the official Xinhua news agency on behalf of the People &apos;s Bank of China , the central bank . 
the figures represent weighted averages and not closing prices and are annual percentage rates . 
turnover surged to 2.175 billion yuan on Friday from 878 million yuan with the 60-day contract the most actively traded . 
trading was active on Friday mainly because some market players dismissed rumours that the central bank would shortly cut bank reserve ratios , traders said . 
&quot; Rumours about such a cut made trading very dull on Thursday , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; But on Friday , some said an imminent cut was not possible . 
this helped to boost sentiment . 
both state banks and non-banking financial institutions , which trade through short-term financial centres or money brokerages run by the central bank , were active on Friday , traders said . 
traders said they expected interbank rates were likely to move narrowly but in relatively active trading next Monday .
