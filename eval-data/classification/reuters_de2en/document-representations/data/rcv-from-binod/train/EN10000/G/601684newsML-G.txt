the United States welcomes Pope John Paul &apos;s scheduled visit to Cuba in January 1998 and hopes it will encourage change on the island , a senior State Department official said on Wednesday . 
&quot; The United States has said publicly and privately that we applaud the visit of the pope to Cuba , &quot; Michael Ranneberger , coordinator for Cuban affairs , said in a televised conference . 
&quot; His Holiness is known around the world as a spokesman for freedom , for human rights and social justice , as such his visit can only be positive from this point of view , &quot; he said in a Worldnet conference transmitted to Havana from Washington . 
&quot; We hope of course that the results of this visit encourage a process of more freedom in the country . 
Ranneberger added the papal visit in itself would not lead to a change in Washington &apos;s policy towards Cuba , which includes a 35-year-old economic embargo . 
U.S. policy would shift only if Cuba undertook &quot; fundamental changes towards democracy and in respect for human rights , &quot; Ranneberger said . 
if such changes took place as a result of the pope &apos;s visit , then this would be a very encouraging development , he added . 
the pope is to travel to Cuba Jan . 21-25 on a visit agreed to in November 1996 at a historic meeting he had with Cuban President Fidel Castro at the Vatican . 
that meeting marked an improvement in relations between the island &apos;s Communist authorities and the Roman Catholic church . 
the Worldnet conference given by Ranneberger on Wednesday was organised by the U.S. government &apos;s information agency and broadcast to foreign journalists in Havana and panels of journalists and academics in Bogota and Guatemala .
