one of Burma &apos;s top generals said the nation &apos;s independence and sovereignty were being threatened and he called on teachers and students to counter such threats , official media reported on Friday . 
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt , who serves as Secretary One of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) , made the comments in a speech on Thursday to students and teachers . 
&quot; It has been nearly a decade that some neo-colonialist superpower countries have been blatantly meddling in Burma whenever opportune , &quot; he said in an apparent reference to the United States . 
last week , the SLORC alleged that U.S. undercover agents were involved in plotting anti-government activities . 
the United States , which imposed economic sanctions on Burma in May because of Rangoon &apos;s human rights record , has denied the charges . 
Burma &apos;s authorities have also accused Washington of trying to exploit the country &apos;s democracy leader , Aung San Suu Kyi . 
&quot; It is high time for the entire people of Myanmar ( Burma ) to realise that the independence and sovereignty of the nation is being physically and openly intervened and threatened , &quot; Khin Nyunt said in his speech . 
Khin Nyunt also called on teachers to make pupils understand the threats and counter them . 
several of Burma &apos;s major universities have been closed since December following rare student street demonstrations against the government . 
the government has reopened some universities but larger ones , where the unrest began , are still closed . 
authorities will not say when classes will resume . 
students were a driving force in 1988 pro-democracy demonstrations which were eventually quashed by the military , with thousands dead or imprisoned .
