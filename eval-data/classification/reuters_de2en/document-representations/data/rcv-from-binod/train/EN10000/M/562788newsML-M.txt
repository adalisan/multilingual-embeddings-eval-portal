Australian bond yields were modestly lower in early trading as the market squared up on the off chance of a surprise policy easing after Tuesday &apos;s policy making board meeting . 
&quot; We saw a bit of business overnight , and the market &apos;s clearing up after that , and ahead of 9.30 ( a.m. ) just in case we get an announcement , &quot; one trader said . 
however , economists do not expect the meeting would have endorsed an easing in the wake of last week &apos;s firm wages data . 
prior to last week &apos;s average weekly earnings report , which showed annual growth above the RBA &apos;s perceived 4.5 percent comfort zone , they had been some speculation of an easing with inflation remaining benign , unemployment sticking above 8.5 percent and a modest outcome to the &quot; living wage &quot; claim . 
meanwhile , sentiment remains positive ahead of next Tuesday &apos;s federal budget and has seen long dated yields trade around their lowest level since February in the past couple of days as the market anticipates a bond friendly outcome . 
the steady tone saw the market slightly outperform U.S. debt , which weakened slightly after its three-year note auction . 
the auction , part of the quarterly refunding , met a disappointing response and further supply is due later on Wednesday with the sale of US $ 12.0 billion of 10-year notes . 
Canadian bonds also slipped with the U.S. , while New Zealand debt weakened with a fall in the N.Z.
