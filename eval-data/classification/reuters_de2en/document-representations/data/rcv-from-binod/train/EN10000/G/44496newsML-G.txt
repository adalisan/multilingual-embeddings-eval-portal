at least 10,000 Kurdish refugees fled northern Iraq for the Iranian border on Tuesday for fear that President Saddam Hussein would regain control of their embattled region , witnesses said . 
the refugees streamed to Sairan Ban , one of at least four border crossings where United Nations officials expected up to 75,000 Kurds to gather following the takeover of northern Iraq by a Baghdad-backed Kurdish militia faction . 
&quot; We &apos;re afraid . 
we don &apos;t trust the government of Saddam Hussein , &quot; said a headmaster from the city of Sulaimaniya , which the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) , now aligned with Saddam , captured from the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) on Monday . 
it was too early to assess what price Saddam would extract from the KDP in return for his support . 
but Kurdish residents were taking no chances . 
many remembered the poison gas Saddam used against Kurdish villagers in 1988 . 
Sairan Ban crossing was closed , so thousands of people were backed up , hanging out of hundreds of cars that jammed a hot , dusty road from Penjwin , 30 km ( 18 miles ) away . 
tractors pulled wagons piled high with belongings . 
they were joined by hundreds of armed PUK guerrillas on the run . 
it was unclear whether refugees were allowed to cross anywhere . 
U.N. officials in Iraq near the border said they had heard of a queue extending 35 km ( 21 miles ) from Sulaimaniya towards Chamchamal on Sunday . 
Iran appealed for world aid for nearly 200,000 refugees . 
in Geneva , U.N. officials said they had been assured by Iran that refugees would be allowed to cross if necessary . 
other U.N. officials in Iraq said Iran was willing to create a slender buffer zone . 
an estimated two million Kurds poured into Turkey and Iran in 1991 when Saddam crushed Kurdish and Shi &apos;ite Moslem uprisings which erupted after Iraq &apos;s defeat at the hands of a Western alliance in the Gulf War . 
most of the Kurds returned to northern Iraq after the Western allies set up a safe haven and began regular air patrols to shield civilians from any attack by Baghdad . 
in Sulaimaniya , thousands of KDP guerrillas drove around the city , waving flags . 
patriotic music blared from loudspeakers . 
some buildings were on fire , but there was little sign of heavy fighting . 
U.N. officials said they would provide medical supplies to the refugees to fight dysentery , but said they had no intention of providing food or tents that allow the Kurds to settle in for a protracted stay . 
KDP guerrillas said they took Sulaimaniya , the last PUK stronghold , on Monday evening after moving in from Halabja to the southeast . 
before the final attack the PUK burned its headquarters , ammunition dumps and its members &apos; homes to deny the KDP the opportunity of looting them , a senior U.N. official said . 
&quot; capturing symbols is what it is all about . 
burning them , looting them and putting them on TV , &quot; he said . 
Washington launched 44 cruise missiles at southern Iraq after tens of thousands of Iraqi government troops helped the KDP capture the city of Arbil on August 31 . 
there were reports after the fall of Arbil that Iraqi security forces , helped by the KDP , had rounded up and executed over 100 members of the opposition Iraqi National Congress ( Inc ) in the city . 
President Bill Clinton said on Monday the United States was helping &quot; those who have worked with us &quot; to flee the fighting in northern Iraq . 
the United States urged Tehran and Baghdad to stop fuelling inter-Kurdish violence in northern Iraq .
