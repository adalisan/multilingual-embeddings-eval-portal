the Czech Republic is one of the frontrunners to join an enlarged NATO , British defence minister Michael Portillo said on Tuesday . 
Portillo met Czech Defence Minister Miloslav Vyborny in London to sign a memorandum of understanding between the two countries to deepen military ties . 
&quot; We are all working hard towards NATO enlargement and although I cannot speculate about who might join , the Czech Republic is clearly among the frontrunners , &quot; he told reporters . 
NATO , the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation , will hold a summit in Madrid in early July at which it is expected to invite a number of eastern European nations to the negotiating table with the aim of having them join by 1999 , the defence alliance &apos;s 50th anniversary . 
Portillo said the West had a &quot; moral obligation &quot; to open up its institutions to new democracies , including the Czech Republic , adding that NATO &apos;s standards were demanding and would require a strong commitment from the Czech government . 
Poland and Hungary are also widely tipped to join the 16-member North Atlantic alliance . 
Portillo said a Czech pledge to increase defence spending by 0.1 percentage points of national income each year was encouraging . 
in its 1997 budget , the Czech government proposed to give its defence ministry a budget of 32 billion crowns ( $ 1.14 billion ) . 
in 1996 , it received less than 31 billion . 
Vyborny baulked at saying he was confident that the Czech Republic would secure NATO membership soon but said : &quot; I am sure it would be good for us and for Europe . 
Portillo said the UK-Czech memorandum cemented a structure for exchanging information and firming up political contacts . 
&quot; It confirms a strong , bilateral relationship between Britain and the Czech Republic , &quot; he said .
