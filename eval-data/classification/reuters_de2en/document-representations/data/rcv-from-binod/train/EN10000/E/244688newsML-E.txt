around half of Britain &apos;s managers believe the November budget will not be good for business and over half think it had more to do with short-term political aims than long-term economic goals , the Institute of Management said . 
in a survey of 312 managers , it found that 69 percent did not believe the government could achieve a planned seven percent cut in spending , and more than half thought underlying inflation in 1997 would be above the government &apos;s 2.5 percent target . 
&quot; Managers do not share the Chancellor &apos;s breezy confidence about the UK economy . 
a shiver runs up their spines as they face the chilling prospect of rising interest rates and inflation , &quot; the Institute &apos;s director-general , Roger Young , said . 
in his November 26 budget , Chancellor Kenneth Clarke cut the basic income tax rate by one percentage point to 23 percent . 
the poll , conducted over the past week , showed 60 percent of managers believed the cut in income tax was not justified , with over half saying it was likely to fuel inflation . 
as many as 72 percent expected interest rates to rise before the election , due by May 22 next year , while only a quarter expected a reduction in corporate taxes to benefit them .
