Russian markets are ready to rally over the next week as short-term traders push up prices on hopes President Boris Yeltsin will fully recover from heart surgery , analysts said on Wednesday . 
shares prices were marked up three to four percent before trade opened on Wednesday as dealers reacted to further news of Yeltsin &apos;s health in anticipation of follow-through buying . 
&quot; In this country you have a coup one day , and three days later everybody says &apos; Great , we &apos;ve survived &apos; , &quot; said Flemings Moscow general manager Mark Jarvis , who was bullish on the long and medium term . 
Yeltsin had a successful quintuple bypass on Tuesday and resumed his full presidential authority on Wednesday , though doctors say the next week will be an important recovery period . 
Russian MinFin bonds gained about half a point on Tuesday &apos;s close and traders said that the T-bill , or GKO , market looked ready to shave a percent or more from yields , especially on long paper , in Wednesday &apos;s extra trading session . 
the yield on a new issue of six-month T-bills averaged 54.06 percent at auction on Wednesday , down from 58.46 a week ago . 
&quot; Everything is going up just because Yeltsin is all right and is breathing by himself , &quot; said one MinFin dealer . 
some dealers said shares could rise as much as five to 10 percent over the next week , especially among second-tier and preferred stocks which have more room for growth and are gaining acceptance by foreign investors . 
but many analysts said strength across markets over the next week would be based on short-term traders who expect to take profits soon , as demand from larger , longer-term investors increased , assuming Yeltsin staged a full recovery . 
&quot; There is an important period for speculation on all Russian markets . 
new real money will appear on the market only after the situation with Yeltsin is clear , &quot; said Alliance-Menatep chief debt trader Dmitry Falkovich . 
fixed income investors will be watching and waiting for indications of economic health , such as the yield on Russia &apos;s Eurobond , to be issued in the next couple of weeks . 
but markets would not show such extreme volatility as they did in the period around the June-July presidential election . 
despite a surge of speculation behind price gains , analysts said the shares , the most sensitive market to political news , were not overvalued as in July . 
it is still far below its high of July 4 , when the RTS index reached 227.79 , generally considered overvalued . 
Tuesday &apos;s 183.95 was near the 185.00 level on September 4 , just before Yeltsin announced he would have heart surgery . 
many investors have already allocated the bulk of funds available for Russia and others , over the next months , will consider moving out of the market to take end-of-year profits , the analysts said . 
Alfa Capital researcher Kristen Burton Steiner said equities would jump over the next week but that large institutional investment was still on the horizon . 
&quot; After the next couple of weeks there will be a gradual , general rise in anticipation of this take-off next year . 
but we &apos;ve been waiting for this take-off for two and a half years now .
