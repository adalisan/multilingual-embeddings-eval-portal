a Sri Lankan media watchdog on Wednesday petitioned the Supreme Court over proposed broadcast legislation seen by opponents as an effort to stifle freedom of speech . 
the bill , introduced in parliament last week , seeks to set up a broadcasting authority with wide powers to monitor , regulate and grant operating licences to radio and television broadcasters . 
the Supreme Court must rule in three weeks . 
&quot; We &apos;re challenging the bill on the grounds that it contravenes constitutional provisions with regard to the right of free expression , that it imposes unnecessary restrictions on the right of free expression , &quot; Lucien Rajakarunanayake , a trustee of the Free Media Movement ( FMM ) , told Reuters . 
the proposed authority will pave the way for complete control by the government over the electronic media , Rajakarunanayake said . 
&quot; This is quite contrary to the recommendations made by the special committee appointed by the media minister to recommend changes to all laws governing the media to bring about a more democratic media culture in Sri Lanka , &quot; he added . 
the main opposition United National Party ( UNP ) , media groups and some members of the ruling People &apos;s Alliance ( PA ) have lambasted the bill . 
the UNP on Tuesday petitioned the Supreme Court , saying the bill was unconstitutional . 
officials at two private television stations said their organisations had either petitioned the court or planned to do so . 
UNP sources said the bill was doomed if the Supreme Court ruled it needed a two-thirds vote in parliament , because the ruling PA , with a one-seat majority , would find it hard to pass the bill . 
the UNP last week objected to the inclusion of the defence secretary in the proposed authority &apos;s board of directors , saying the military &apos;s growing role was a cause of concern . 
Sri Lanka &apos;s government , fighting Tamil rebels demanding independence for minority Tamils in the north and east of the island , has warned private radio and television stations against broadcasting news that could create ethnic disharmony . 
Sri Lanka has eight television stations -- two owned by the government -- and about a dozen radio stations , most of them privately owned .
