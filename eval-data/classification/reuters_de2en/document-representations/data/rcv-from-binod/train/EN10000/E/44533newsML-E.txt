high inflation , deficits , unstable growth and heavy borrowing have increased pressures on Turkey &apos;s economy , and no sign of near-term relief seems to be emerging , analysts said . 
&quot; A crisis is on the way , the government sleeps , &quot; liberal daily Yeni Yuzyil headlined on Tuesday . 
Izzettin Onder , an economics professor at the Istanbul University , said the overall economy signals crisis . 
&quot; But a crisis is unlikely in the short term unless inflow of foreign funds stops , &quot; Onder told Reuters . 
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan &apos;s resource plan , unveiled in July , has failed to fuel optimism among economists who think the plan is unrealistic and unapplicable . 
Erbakan expected his plan to raise $ 10 billion in the next three years . 
but economists said it was unlikely and said the government urgently needed to implement a medium-term stability program . 
&quot; This is a plan to liquidate present assets in the short term and borrow more . 
it contains nothing else , &quot; said Faruk Selcuk , associated professor of economic at Bilkent University . 
bankers said short-term capital inflow , boosted by high real domestic interest rates , foreign reserves of about $ 16 billion and decisive central bank and terasury actions could prevent the country from falling into a financial crisis in the short run . 
but they noted that increased concerns over the fate of the economy had been pushing up Turkey &apos;s risk premium in international borrowing markets . 
&quot; Most of the mandates given earlier this year for foreign loans arrangements have been shelved . 
the costs have risen , &quot; said a senior private banker , who declined to be named . 
&quot; A medium-scale Turkish bank can not get a syndicated loan at prices lower than Libor plus 150 basis points now . 
it was around 110-120 basis point over Libor in June , &quot; said the banker . 
after months of political turmoil and delay in key economic actions , almost all economists and officials agreed that Turkey will fail to achieve this year &apos;s key economic targets . 
in early 1996 , the government set a year-on-year inflation goal at 65 percent . 
but economists forecast inflation , which was 79 percent last month , to be above 80 percent at end-1996 . 
last month , central bank governor Gazi Ercel said his bank aimed to brake inflation at 80 percent . 
the current account deficit may also overshoot the target $ 3.8 billion by some $ 1 billion , and foreign trade deficit could exceed $ 20 billion against the target of $ 16 billion . 
the official 861-trillion lira budget deficit goal has also meant nothing for economists since Finance Minister Abdullatif Sener said in July the deficit could hit 1,300 trillion lira . 
military build-up in the southeast against rebel Kurds and delays in the Iraqi oil-for-food plan , which was hoped to earn Ankara over $ 500 million , also aggravated fiscal pains . 
Selcuk said the public sector borrowing requirement could rise to 14 percent of gross national product ( GNP ) from about six perent last year . 
though GNP growth at 10.3 percent in the first half of the year seemed to remain well above the target of 4.5 percent , analysts saw that only as another sign of the economy &apos;s inability to achieve a sustainable and moderate economic growth . 
privatisation efforts have also almost come to a standstill . 
Turkey has raised $ 292 million through sell-offs so far this year , far below the 1996 target of $ 2 billion . 
any new attempts to increase privatisation earnings were not expected to bring in any more than $ 500 million this year . 
the absence of firm economic action to increase government revenues soon leaves borrowing as the major , but costly , source of funds to finance public deficits . 
the treasury pays an annual compound rate of around 120 percent to borrow from domestic markets . 
economists said the amount of total domestic debt stock , 2,376 trillion lira at end-July , was not very high for the economy . 
but the small size of the Turkish financial system and the stocks &apos; maturity profile of 63 percent in the short-term make it a major source of concern for the economy . 
government plans to issue foreign currency-denominated bonds with a maturity of up to three years to ease pressures were seen raising only some $ 1 billion . 
they said concerns about the economy and a sub-investment grade credit rating was also restraining Turkey &apos;s ability to raise funds in international markets at &quot; reasonable &quot; rates . 
the treasury , which last issued 500 million marks of Eurobonds with a coupon of 8.5 percent in July , has already delayed a Samurai bond issue , initially planned for July . 
&quot; International financial and economic institutions may put the screws on slowly , &quot; said a former Turkish cabinet minister . 
&quot; I think they have already started to screw , &quot; he said , referring to warnings from credit rating agencies in July and the International Monetary Fund in August .
