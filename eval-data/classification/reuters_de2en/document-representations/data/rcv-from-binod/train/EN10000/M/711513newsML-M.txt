French September bond futures rallied to set a new contract high as U.S. bonds extended last week &apos;s gains on receding rate rise fears and European bonds were buoyed by enthusiasm about monetary union , traders said . 
they said these factors , combined with continued demand for 10-year bonds from domestic investors flush with cash , helped hoist the contract up 0.56 to 130.52 , safely passing the previous high of 130.16 . 
the spread between 10-year oats and Bunds moved as much as minus 14 basis points in France &apos;s favour from minus 12 on Friday as 10-year OAT yields fell as low as 5.39 percent . 
&quot; It seems the U.S. is leading the market . 
in France and the markets everyone is very optimistic about EMU ... but we still don &apos;t have a clue about ( 1997 ) deficits in France and Germany , &quot; Philippe Brossard , head of research at ABN AMRO Finance said . 
traders said optimism in the Italian bond market , following backing for Italy &apos;s EMU plan from a meeting of European finance ministers in Brussels , also spilled over to other bond markets . 
they said non-resident buying had pushed the future higher at the start of the session and then propelled it past resistance at 130.14-18 , triggering stops which in turn accelerated the move higher . 
the market seemed to be unaffected by three long-dated French franc bond issues during Monday totalling some nine billion francs . 
thirty-year oats also outperformed their German counterparts with the spread moving to minus seven basis points . 
September PIBOR moved higher with the rest of the French curve despite a slightly weaker franc . 
the contract rose two basis points to 96.59 , its highest level for a week . 
the franc slipped to 3.3715 per mark from 3.3690 late on Friday . 
analysts said the main domestic events Tuesday would be speeches by Bank of France governor Jean-Claude Trichet and Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn although few expected any more details about the state of French public finances ahead of an audit due to be published on July 21 .
