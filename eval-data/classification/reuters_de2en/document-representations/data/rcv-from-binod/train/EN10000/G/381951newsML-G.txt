a majority of Slovaks would vote in favour of NATO membership in a national referendum , according to an opinion poll by the independent Focus research agency . 
asked during the first weekend of February how they would vote in a referendum on Slovakia &apos;s NATO ( North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ) membership , 65 percent of those who would have taken part were in favour and 35 percent against , according to the poll , made available to Reuters on Monday . 
in a Focus poll last November , 41 percent of respondents supported NATO membership compared with 23 percent against . 
Slovakia wants to be among the first post-communist countries invited to join NATO when the alliance nominates candidates for membership at its summit in July in Madrid . 
but Western countries have expressed concern about Slovakia &apos;s economic and democratic credentials and do not expect it to be among the first east European nations to receive an invitation . 
last week the Slovak parliament approved a resolution calling for a referendum on NATO membership , the establishment of foreign military bases on Slovak territory , and the deployment of nuclear weapons on Slovak soil . 
President Michal Kovac must set a date for the referendum within 30 days and it must be held within a further 90 days .
