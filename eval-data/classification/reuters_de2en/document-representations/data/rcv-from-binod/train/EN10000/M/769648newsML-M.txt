U.S. millfeed prices were mostly steady on Thursday with dealers monitoring this week &apos;s gains in Chicago Board of Trade corn futures . 
dealers said the runup in corn was not expected to affect nearby midds markets but would impact midds in the long term . 
&quot; The runup in corn is causing the deferred markets to firm up , &quot; a Kansas dealer said . 
he added some pastures in Kansas , Oklahoma and Texas were dry . 
but livestock was still feeding on grass . 
&quot; pastures were burning up , &quot; he said , referring to the high temperatures in parts of Texas . 
in Minneapolis , a broker said buying was limited but noted a little more interest for the deferreds . 
the northeastern market was holding steady . 
&quot; The feed mixers seem to be in fine shape , &quot; a buffalo dealer said . 
&quot; Everyone seems to be pretty well set for next week , both sellers and buyers . 
so it &apos;s a thin market , holding its own , &quot; he said . 
the Pennsylvania market gave up $ 1 or $ 2 earlier this week , trading at about $ 81 , he added .
