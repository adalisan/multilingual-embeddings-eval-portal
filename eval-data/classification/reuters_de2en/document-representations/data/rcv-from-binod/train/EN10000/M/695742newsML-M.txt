Czech stocks continued their downward path on Monday as the Prague Stock Exchange &apos;s heaviest issues lost ground in quiet trading . 
telephone monopoly SPT Telecom lost 15 crowns to 3,400 , and the country &apos;s largest commercial bank Komercni Banka fell 37 crowns to 1,680 , pulling the PX50 index down 2.1 points , or 0.43 percent , to 489.0 . 
overall on the PSE , 103 issues rose , while 84 fell and 66 held steady . 
a total of 490.876 shares changed hands on low turnover of 338.1 million crowns . 
dealer Ivan Kusacek of Zivnostenska Banka said he expected quiet &quot; summer activity &quot; to arrive in the coming days with no large price swings . 
Kusacek said he saw SPT shares stagnating or dipping as they had risen recently and some profit taking might take place . 
he said Komercni Banka could see some gains . 
he added that Czech equities were interesting at current levels but some foreign investors were waiting for a further drop in the Czech crown . 
&quot; An up to five percent drop is generally expected . 
they also want to see the effect of government ( restrictive ) economic measures , &quot; he said . 
the crown dropped about 10 percent of its value during May &apos;s speculative attack which forced the central bank to eliminate the currency &apos;s mark / dollar basket and let it float . 
the currency crisis forced the government to adopt a package of austerity measures , including a total of 42 billion crowns in budget cuts . 
the crown has recovered since , and it was trading about seven percent under its formal central parity on Monday afternoon .
