the centrist Nepali Congress party said on Sunday it would attempt to form a new government in the Himalayan kingdom . 
the Nepali Congress , which also headed the outgoing coalition government , said it had elected Girija Prasad Koirala as its new leader and its bid for power would be supported by the Rastriya Prajatantra Party ( RPP ) . 
&quot; We will form the new government and have the support of the RPP , &quot; Nepali Congress General Secretary Taranath Ranabhatt said . 
Party officials said Sher Bahadur Deuba , who resigned as prime minister last Thursday after losing a vote of confidence , had quit as leader of the Nepali Congress paliamentary wing and was replaced by former prime minister Koirala . 
Nepali Congress officials said the 74-year-old Koirala would formally stake his claim to form the new government before King Birendra , who has set a deadline of Monday evening for an end to the political crisis gripping the world &apos;s only Hindu kingdom . 
Birendra , who made himself a British-style constitutional monarch in November 1990 , has called for proposals by 6 : 00 p.m. ( 1215 GMT ) on Monday for a new government . 
the Nepali Congress controls 87 seats in the 205-seat lower house of parliament while the RPP has 19 deputies . 
RPP officials said the party was scheduled to meet later on Sunday and no formal decision had so far been taken on the new government . 
Nepali Congress officials said it was ready for a coalition government headed by Koirala , who struggled for over five decades to restore democracy in Nepal . 
analysts said the move by Nepali Congress to forge a coalition government with the help of RPP was likely to succeed . 
RPP was a key partner of the outgoing coalition but was divided over its support to Deuba . 
Nepal Sadbhavana Party , which has three deputies , was the third member in Deuba &apos;s outgoing coalition . 
indecisive polls in November 1994 meant no party was able to win a majority in parliament and form a stable government . 
this has led to confusion and instability in the country , political analysts said on Sunday . 
&quot; The hung parliament has to be hanged , &quot; said Badri Bahadur Karki , a constitutional lawyer , adding that fresh elections should be held . 
the next general poll is not scheduled until November 1999 . 
business leaders have said Nepal &apos;s economy would suffer if political uncertainty remained unresolved . 
Nepal , which maintained self-imposed isolation until the middle of this century , is one of the world &apos;s 10 poorest countries . 
annual income averages $ 200 a head .
