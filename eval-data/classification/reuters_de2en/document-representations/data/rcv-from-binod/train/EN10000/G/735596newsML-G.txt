Peru &apos;s political crisis deepened on Wednesday with the resignation of Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela and President Alberto Fujimori &apos;s popularity falling to its lowest level in seven years in office . 
Tudela &apos;s departure from the cabinet -- apparently due to his concern over a string of embarrassing scandals facing Fujimori -- deprived the government of one of its most widely-respected and popular figures . 
Fujimori &apos;s drop to a 23 percent approval rating showed the depth of public outrage over a phone-tapping scandal and the annulment of an Israeli-born businessman &apos;s citizenship . 
government officials said Fujimori was due to swear in later on Wednesday lawyer Eduardo Ferrero Costa , a member of the team negotiating a border dispute with Ecuador , as Peru &apos;s new foreign minister . 
foreign Ministry sources said Tudela , a 41-year-old independent politician who was at the centre of the hostage crisis at the Japanese embassy this year , was increasingly concerned by the government &apos;s authoritarian style . 
&quot; He had to sacrifice much of his image during the last weeks in really compromising situations ... 
trying to justify the unjustifiable is very costly , &quot; said political analyst Fernando Tuesta . 
Tudela was one of the 72 hostages held for four months by Marxist Tupac Amaru guerrillas in the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence in Lima . 
he narrowly escaped alive after being hit by two bullets in the arm and leg and grenade shards in the shoulder when troops stormed the house on April 22 . 
earlier on Wednesday , leading local pollster Apoyo showed Fujimori &apos;s popularity falling 11 points in nine days to 23 percent . 
the poll of around 400 Lima area residents also showed that 53 percent believed the military really controled power in Peru . 
only 38 percent said Fujimori held the reins . 
Peru &apos;s security forces are widely accused of being behind a phone-tapping scandal revealed by the frecuencia Latina T.V. 
channel , and Sunday &apos;s revocation of Peruvian citizenship for the station &apos;s owner , Baruch Ivcher . 
frecuencia Latina T.V. 
had broken a string of stories alleging human rights abuses and corruption in the security forces , culminating in Sunday &apos;s report on phone-tapping by the secret services just one hour before a government decree stripped Ivcher of his citizenship . 
Fujimori , in an interview with Spanish news agency EFE , blamed his political problems on a campaign by the opposition to present him as a dictator running a police state . 
&quot; The main proof that democracy exists in Peru is that there is a strong opposition ... and that ( opponents ) are not in jail nor persecuted nor exiled nor prevented from doing regular and democratic politics , &quot; he said . 
regarding the phone-tapping , Fujimori said he and his security adviser Vladimiro Montesinos had their conversations taped in 1992 . 
&quot; It is public knowledge that these devices ( to tap phones ) can be easily obtained in the market , &quot; he added . 
the phone scandal , and the cancelling of Ivcher &apos;s nationality on the grounds of bureaucratic &quot; irregularities , &quot; sparked a wave of media and public condemnation and has become a rallying point for Peru &apos;s rejuvenated opposition . 
in the Apoyo poll , Montesinos , considered Fujimori &apos;s right-hand man and his link to the military , received the approval of nine percent of respondents and the disapproval of 79 percent . 
armed forces chief Gen. Nicolas de Bari Hermoza won 15 percent approval and 67 percent disapproval . 
the survey gave no margin of error .
