a rally on the domestic stock market pushed Indian global depositary receipts ( GDRs ) higher in London but international markets failed to share the enthusiasm of domestic investors . 
&quot; Selling emerged in the afternoon and premiums for GDRs have dumped , &quot; said a trader . 
the HSBC James Capel Indian GDR index closed up 0.60 points , 0.86 percent , at 70.63 points , with the premium over the local market at 10.74 percent compared with yesterday &apos;s 15.21 percent . 
the GDR market had been up 2.32 percent in morning trade and the premium was at 12.57 percent but sellers clawed back gains after the Bombay Stock Exchange 30-share index rose 154.47 points , or 4.42 percent , to 3,646.73 . 
&quot; premiums have started to tick back in . 
there is a worry that the local market may have gotten ahead of itself , &quot; said a trader .
