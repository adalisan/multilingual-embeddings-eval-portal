wall Street stocks are expected to opened mixed to lower at the start of trading Thursday in a follow-through from Wednesday &apos;s fall . 
analysts said investors also would be looking past jobless claims due out at 1230 GMT to Friday &apos;s disclosure of March producer prices and retail sales figures . 
those numbers could help the Federal Reserve decide on its next move to raise interest rates . 
&quot; I would expect a slight down opening , pretty much in sympathy with yesterday , &quot; said Thom Brown , managing director of Rutherford Brown and Catherwood . 
&quot; Yesterday was not a very impressive performance at the end of the day . 
the Dow industrials closed down 45.32 at 6,563.84 , ending a three-day rebound . 
the Nasdaq composite index was off 7.94 at 1249.43 . 
Hildegard Zagorski , an analyst at prudential Securities , said , &quot; I think the bound kind of ran out of steam . 
that bounce that we had was on low volume , so it was a little bit suspicious .
