the Bulgarian Lev closed at 221-223 per dollar , softer than the 219-221 in morning interbank trade as foreign currency demand outweighed supply , dealers said . 
&quot; Banks and clients sought relatively large dollar volumes for pending payments and short-covering but supply was insufficient to meet demand , &quot; a dealer said . 
traders said the main reason for the rise in dollar demand was the cut of the main interest rate . 
the central bank today cut its main interest rate to 20 percent monthly from 25 percent , or 240 percent annually from 300 percent . 
&quot; ( Dollar ) supply fell as banks and clients , which pared forex positions under the previous rate and invested in high yield treasury paper , now tried to avoid losses from a possible dollar rise , &quot; another dealer said . 
the central bank supported the Lev with dollar sales at 219.50-220 levs in the morning but when withdrew from the market in the afternoon , traders said . 
Central bank officials declined comment . 
the Lev traded at 236-237 per dollar on September 23 when the central bank sharply hiked the main rate to 300 percent annually from 108 percent in a bid to restore confidence in the declining national currency .
