boat patrols cruised the flooded streets of this devastated North Dakota city on Monday searching for stragglers as cranes prepared to knock down fire-ravaged buildings in the gutted downtown district . 
roughly 90 percent of Grand forks was under water from the cresting Red River , which has flooded vast stretches of the northern U.S. plains for the past three weeks . 
the White House announced President Bill Clinton would visit on Tuesday , arriving at an Air Force base used as an emergency shelter by city residents under mandatory evacuation orders . 
&quot; When he sees the disastrous condition we are in he will grant us assistance -- much assistance , &quot; Grand forks Mayor Pat Owens told reporters at a daily news briefing . 
icy , murky floodwaters polluted with raw sewage stood as much as 10 feet ( three metres ) deep in downtown streets , where buildings stood gutted and gaping from the fierce weekend fire . 
across the Red River in East Grand forks , Minnesota , houses were nearly submerged and some had floated loose from their foundations , the mayor of the town of 9,000 said . 
&quot; Many people left with only the shirt on their backs . 
no money , no possessions . 
we &apos;ve told them to stay out of town for at least two weeks , &quot; Mayor Lynn Stauss said . 
officials worried that federal assistance of between $ 10,000 and $ 15,000 per family would fail to meet the needs of many residents who have lost everything in what experts have called a once-in-500-year flood . 
&quot; I think we need to have money available for people to rebuild their houses . 
grant money , not loans . 
the money available now is just not enough , &quot; said U.S. Representative Collin Peterson , Democrat of Minnesota . 
the recovery effort cannot begin until the waters recede , and the river had yet to reach its expected crest at Grand forks of 54 feet ( 16.4 m ) -- 26 feet ( 7.9 m ) above flood stage . 
meanwhile , 75 miles ( 120 km ) upstream in Fargo , where a massive diking operation kept the state &apos;s largest city mostly dry , the waters were dropping by an inch ( 2.5 cm ) an hour . 
but Grand forks faced clear disaster . 
journalists taken aloft in a National Guard helicopter saw a city of 50,000 people transformed into a ghost town stranded amid a vast , chocolate-coloured swamp . 
the business district , hit by a fire after floodwaters overpowered makeshift dikes on Friday , was a blackened ruin and motorboats manned by emergency crews puttered through the flooded streets looking for people stranded amid the chaos . 
officials said they planned to begin moving in cranes to begin demolition work on the several city blocks that were consumed by the fire . 
despite the crisis , police reported only two burglaries -- of an auto parts store and a pawn shop -- and said efforts were now concentrated on removing people to safety . 
police spokesman Byron Sieber said a blind man and a &quot; heavily medicated &quot; 96-year-old woman had to be forcibly removed from their homes as floodwaters lapped at their doorsteps . 
Sieber also said he spotted two people riding jet-skis during a sweep of downtown . 
the last of 60 hospital patients were evacuated late on Sunday night from a threatened hospital shut down because of advancing waters . 
in addition , 70 prisoners had been evacuated , including 12 high-risk federal prisoners who were taken to devils Lake , about 90 miles ( 144 km ) west . 
residents may not be allowed to return to their homes for more than two weeks because of the lack of services . 
the city &apos;s water treatment plant was flooded on Saturday , and it may be three weeks before fresh water flows again . 
officials also began worrying about new threats to the city . 
a desperate operation was under way to keep the floodwaters from swamping the telephone switching station , which if lost could wipe out all phone services in the area . 
a gas-powered emergency generator was also rushed into place at a nearby chemical plant to head off any possibility that a sudden power outage could cause it to vent its noxious contents into the air . 
across the Canadian border in Manitoba , 750 people were being evacuated as the northward-flowing Red continued to rise . 
officials expect the river to crest in Emerson , about 100 miles ( 160.9 km ) south of Winnipeg , on Wednesday and announced that the border crossing would be closed at midnight on Monday .
