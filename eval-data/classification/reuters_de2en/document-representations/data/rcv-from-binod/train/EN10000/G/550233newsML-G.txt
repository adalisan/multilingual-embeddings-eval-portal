Hollywood film star Sidney Poitier said on Wednesday he has not yet learned Japanese but intends to for his new role as the Bahamas ambassador to Japan . 
Poitier , at his first Nassau news conference since presenting his credentials to Japanese Emperor Akihito on April 16 , said he plans to try to learn the language and will need all the help he can get . 
Poitier , who won an Oscar for the 1963 film &quot; Lilies of the Field , &quot; said he would be responsible for promoting Bahamian tourism and agriculture in Japan and would try to increase the number of Japanese ships registered under the Bahamian flag . 
Poitier was born in the United States but his parents came from Cat Island in the Bahamas and he spent his early years there . 
the Bahamas , a 700-island nation , has no embassy in Japan and Poitier will not live there . 
he said he would continue his acting career while performing his duties as ambassador . 
it reflects a part of my value system as a Bahamian , &quot; he said . 
Poitier , who has made 50 movies during his career , is still actively involved in filmmaking . 
he starred in a recently released film about South Africa &apos;s Nelson Mandela and just completed filming of &quot; The jackal &quot; co-starring Bruce Willis .
