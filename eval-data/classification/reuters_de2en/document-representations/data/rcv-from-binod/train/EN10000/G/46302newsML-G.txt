China said on Wednesday it welcomed the nuclear test ban treaty passed by the United Nations and urged worldwide accession to the pact . 
&quot; This undoubtedly conforms to the common interests of the entire international community , &quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said . 
China hoped the treaty would be signed as soon as possible and would be &quot; acceded to and honoured worldwide &quot; , the Xinhua news agency quoted Shen as saying . 
he did not refer specifically to India , which has dug in its heels against the pact . 
&quot; This move will surely contribute to the advancement of the nuclear disarmament process , the prevention of nuclear weapons proliferation and promotion of international peace and security , &quot; Shen said . 
however , he said the international community still faced a long and tough task if it is to bring about a world free of nuclear weapons , adding that this should be the ultimate objective of the countries of the world .
