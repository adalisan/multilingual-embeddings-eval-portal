South Africa is expected to have recorded another healthy trade surplus in August , which should help sharply reduce the current account deficit in the second half of the year , economists said on Friday . 
a repeat of July &apos;s huge surplus of 2.58 billion rand was ruled out , but all nine analysts polled by Reuters predicted a surplus above 500 million rand with the consensus at 760 million rand . 
the data is due for release from Wednesday . 
a deficit on services running at around 1.5 billion rand a month should still leave South Africa with a monthly current account shortfall of some 750 million rand . 
but this is a marked improvement on the three months to the end of June when the current account deficit jumped to 4.6 billion rand , or to an average of more than 1.5 billion a month , which had lifted the half-year accumulated deficit to 6.9 billion . 
Sanlam economist Peter Calitz said July &apos;s massive surplus , reflecting a back-dated correction for earlier months , had reduced the accumulated deficit to some 5.9 billion rand for the first seven months of the year . 
and he predicts an improving trend for the remainder of the year , with the 1996 current account deficit on the balance of payments likely to come in between 9.0 and 10.0 billion rand , down from 12.7 billion in 1995 . 
&quot; The depreciation of the rand is slowly working through to improved exports and a slowdown in the growth of imports , &quot; he said , adding that a bumper agricultural crop would also help . 
aside from the trade balance , attention will focus next week on August preliminary money supply figures , due on September 27 . 
economists expected year-on-year M3 growth to increase to a consensus 15.7 percent , mainly due to a low comparative period , after dipping to a preliminary 14.69 percent in July from June &apos;s 15.65 percent . 
growth in private sector credit extension is seen slowing marginally in August to 17.9 percent from 18.50 in July . 
Nedcor economist Kevin Lings noted slower retail sales growth appeared to underline evidence of a credit slowdown . 
but credit and money figures remain well above levels viewed as acceptable by the Reserve Bank . 
Governor Chris Stals has said he would would like to see credit extension growth fall back to around 12 percent while the official guideline for M3 growth is pegged at six to ten percent . 
Stals said last month in his annual address the excessive growth in both numbers required a continued tight monetary policy , a point he reiterated to European investors during a roadshow last week , according to economists . 
Anlaysts said a slowdown in the core economy would start to curb credit extension from now on , but it might take until the second quarter of 1997 to bring it down to the desired levels . 
that will restrict the scope for cuts in interest rates , although most economists believed the cycle has peaked . 
the bank rate currently stands at 16 percent while prime goes from 19.50 to 19.25 percent as of October 1 , following a scrapping of a financial services levy from that date .
