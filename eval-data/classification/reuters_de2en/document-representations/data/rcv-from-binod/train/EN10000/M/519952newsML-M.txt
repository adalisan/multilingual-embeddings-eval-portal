oil prices steadied on Friday with the help of a late spring cold snap in the heating oil market of the northeastern United States . 
Bellwether London Brent crude futures rose 22 cents a barrel close at $ 17.91 a barrel after hitting a nine-month low of $ 17.54 a week ago . 
low temperatures have boosted heating oil demand in the U.S. northeast all week and weather forecasts predict below normal temperatures will persist into next week . 
&quot; Most people were assuming the heating oil season had run its course and although there &apos;s no danger of any supply disruption the U.S. market is looking a little tight on heating oil , &quot; one trader said . 
dealers said that oil prices appeared to have found support , temporarily at least , after the heavy slide which has cost $ 7 since early January . 
&quot; We have reached an equilibrium zone for now while we await impending supply developments , &quot; Charles Gray at prudential Bache in London said . 
oil prices have been treading water for the past couple of weeks in anticipation of a surge in U.S. gasoline demand to fuel the summer driving season . 
but the country &apos;s leading oil industry association said this week that domestic gasoline supplies were expected to be more than sufficient to satisfy even the most bullish forecasts for demand growth . 
in its annual outlook for the summer , the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) said gasoline supply would meet demand , even if it grew by 2.5 percent . 
earlier this month , the U.S. Department of Energy said it expected gasoline demand to grow by 1.8 percent this month . 
oil lost any support on Friday from the prospect of a strike by Venezuelan shipping pilots . 
the pilots agreed to drop a threat of industrial action after the government agreed to tighten oil tanker draught limits in a channel through Lake Maracaibo that has seen three groundings in the past two months . 
Venezuela tops the list of oil exporters to the United States .
