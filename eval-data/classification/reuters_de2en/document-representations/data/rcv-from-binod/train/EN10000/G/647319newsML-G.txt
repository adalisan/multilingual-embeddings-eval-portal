French Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has packed his private office with pro-European technocrats , many of whom served under ex-premier Michel Rocard or with former European Commission president Jacques Delors . 
Jospin &apos;s chief of staff , Olivier Schrameck , took the unusual step of presenting the prime minister &apos;s team of advisers to the media on Monday breaking with a tradition of relative anonymity . 
although most have previously served Socialist governments , few of the 22 aides has a strong ideological bent . 
Schrameck &apos;s deputy is Jean-Pierre Jouyet , 43 , who ran Delors &apos; cabinet , the French term for a minister &apos;s private office , in Brussels in 1991-94 . 
Jean Vidal , 58 , a diplomat and former diplomatic counsellor to the late president Francois Mitterrand will be Jospin &apos;s European affairs adviser . 
he served as French permanent representative to the European Union in 1989-92 . 
the new premier &apos;s diplomatic adviser will be Jean-Maurice Ripert , 44 , a diplomat who held the same position under Rocard . 
Pierre-Alain Muet , 49 , an economist who was an adviser to Jospin at the education ministry in the early 1990s and helped his 1995 presidential campaign , will be in charge of an economic policy think-tank . 
senior treasury official Pierre Duquesne , 42 , will be the prime minister &apos;s economic and financial adviser , assisted by Florence Parly 34 , for budget questions , and former Rocard aide Jaques Rigaudiat , 50 , will be his social affairs counsellor .
