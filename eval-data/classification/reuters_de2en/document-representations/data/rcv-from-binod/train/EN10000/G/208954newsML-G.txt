according to Dutch lore , people in Rotterdam are born with their sleeves rolled up , signifying that , while Amsterdam is the Netherlands &apos; cultural and artistic centre , the great western port city is its industrial heart . 
the same distinction could easily apply to the two sides who clash in the Dutch first division on Sunday evening . 
Feyenoord , the artisans or rough diamonds of Dutch soccer versus aristocratic Ajax Amsterdam , the nation &apos;s &quot; Culture Club &quot; . 
the intense rivalry , often bordering on naked hatred , that exists between these two clubs reflects the cultural divide between the Netherlands &apos; two biggest cities . 
the added twist this year is that Feyenoord , for once , are in the ascendency . 
the Rotterdam club trail league leaders PSV Eindhoven by a single point , while Ajax , 26 times national champions , are languishing in sixth place , nine points adrift of Feyenoord . 
after two years of almost total domination -- of Europe as well as the Netherlands -- Ajax are stuttering , producing a mixed bag of results at home and in the Champions &apos; League . 
in contrast , Feyenoord , who have had to play second fiddle to Ajax for too long , re-built during the close season and have assembled a team that , despite a bizarre 7-2 drubbing last month , looks capable of pushing PSV all the way . 
while statistics show Ajax have won eight of the last 10 league meetings between the two sides in Rotterdam , including the last five , they do not account for the air of grim desperation that hangs over the Amsterdam club . 
the young and talented team that conquered Europe in 1995 and again reached the European Cup final last season , has been hobbled by transfers to the more lucrative Italian and Spanish leagues and decimated by injuries . 
Sunday evening &apos;s game is the first league meeting between the two sides since Ajax triumphed 2-0 in Amsterdam in March with goals from Jari Litmanen and Patrick Kluivert . 
the corresponding fixture in Rotterdam last season saw Clemens Zwijnenberg and Henryk Larsson put Feyenoord 2-0 up inside seven minutes , before Ajax stormed back to win 4-2 on their way to a third successive championship . 
Rotterdam fans are only too well aware that Ajax have double Feyenoord &apos;s tally of 13 Dutch titles and it is four years since the Rotterdam club won the league -- and that was after a 10-year gap during which PSV and Ajax dominated . 
Ajax &apos;s recent European and World Club Cup successes are also too fresh in Rotterdam minds for comfort . 
Feyenoord are in the third round of the UEFA Cup and will be looking to improve on last season &apos;s campaign when they reached the semifinals of the Cup Winners &apos; Cup . 
but European progress will be off the agenda on Sunday as the two old rivals slug it out for league points . 
the bitter rivalry between the two camps has in the past spilled over into violence with drunken fans fighting pitched battles outside the grounds . 
one Amsterdam policeman was forced to brandish his firearm in an attempt to quell skirmishing fans . 
six years ago , a teenage Feyenoord fan was jailed for hurling a home-made bomb which injured over a dozen rival fans at an Ajax-Feyenoord game . 
today , supporters of both clubs are routinely segregated long before kick-off and the ugly physical confrontations of the 1970s and 1980s have largely disappeared , replaced by tasteless chanting from the terraces . 
Feyenoord fans traditionally target Ajax &apos;s Jewish roots , making a hissing sound like gas escaping at World War Two concentration camps and Ajax coach Louis van Gaal has been the butt of unpleasant personal verbal abuse . 
this off-field antagonism between the two camps has also meant that few players have played for both Ajax and Feyenoord . 
Johan Cruyff is a notable exception and two of the current crop -- Ajax &apos;s Arnold Scholten and Feyenoord &apos;s Ronald Koeman -- will be playing against their former club on Sunday . 
as a footnote , gleeful Rotterdam fans claim to have buried a Feyenoord flag beneath the pitch during construction of Ajax &apos;s new stadium , resulting in Ajax &apos;s dramatic slump .
