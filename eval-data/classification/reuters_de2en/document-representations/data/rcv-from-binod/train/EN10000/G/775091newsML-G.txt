U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan will visit President Nelson Mandela on Friday to discuss their joint initiative to end the conflict in Indonesian-ruled East Timor , officials said on Monday . 
foreign Ministry spokesman Pieter Swanepoel said South Africa was told on Monday that Annan and not a U.N. envoy would arrive for the midday meeting in Pretoria . 
government sources said Annan &apos;s surprise decision probably signalled an acceleration of the U.N. &apos; s bid to end the conflict in East Timor . 
in Pretoria , the Portuguese embassy confirmed in a statement on Monday that South Africa had expelled Portuguese Ambassador Vasco Valente last week in response to Indonesian protests about a letter that went astray . 
&quot; The South African authorities , alleging a misunderstanding between the Portuguese embassy and the South African presidency , last Friday ( August 1 ) requested the departure from Pretoria of Ambassador Vasco Valente , &quot; the statement said . 
&quot; The ambassador , who had been due to leave Pretoria at the end of August , returned to Lisbon the next day , &quot; it added , saying Portugal regretted the decision . 
two South African government sources said Lisbon had been given 48 hours to withdraw Valente after it was confirmed he had received and failed to forward or return a letter from Mandela to Indonesian President Suharto , which was delivered to his embassy by mistake . 
&quot; There has been a slight mistake on the part of one individual and he has been asked to leave , &quot; said one source , adding that diplomatic relations with Portugal remained intact . 
in the letter , Mandela asked Suharto to release jailed rebel leader Xanana Gusmao as a first step towards ending the conflict in East Timor , a former Portuguese colony of which Indonesia has taken control . 
details of the letter were published in Portuguese newspapers before Suharto knew of its existence , undermining Mandela &apos;s effort to assist the U.N. &apos; s peace initiative . 
Joel Netshitenzhe , Mandela &apos;s senior spokesman , earlier declined to confirm or deny that Valente had been expelled , but added : 
&quot; The matter has now been resolved and the letter has been received by the Indonesian president and government . 
the process that President Mandela initiated is proceeding smoothly . 
East Timor is the third international conflict in which Mandela has sought personally to intervene . 
he has tried to help bring democracy to Nigeria and sought to mediate a peaceful transfer of power in the former Zaire , now the Democratic Republic of the Congo . 
Mandela visited Suharto last month and won permission to meet jailed rebel leader Xanana Gusmao . 
after his return , he wrote to Suharto asking for the rebel leader &apos;s release and inviting the Indonesian President to South Africa in November . 
he also invited East Timorese bishop and Nobel peace laureate Ximenes Belo to visit him in South Africa . 
Valente was the first foreign diplomat expelled since 1994 , when Mandela won the country &apos;s first democratic elections . 
presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said Mandela would discuss with Annan ways to bolster the U.N. &apos; s initiative for peace in East Timor . 
&quot; The President is doing everything within the parameters of the U.N. mandate on East Timor . 
everything he is doing is designed to underpin the U.N. initiative , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The President really sees this as a medium to long-term effort . 
it is not something that can be resolved quickly , &quot; he said . 
Mankahlana said it was Annan &apos;s decision to visit Mandela in person and not to send an envoy , as originally planned .
