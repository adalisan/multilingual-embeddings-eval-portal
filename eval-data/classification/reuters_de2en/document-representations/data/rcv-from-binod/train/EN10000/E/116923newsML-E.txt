Thailand &apos;s acting finance minister Chaiyawat Wibulswadi vowed on Tuesday to maintain strict fiscal policy and said he would continue on the same path as the former finance minister , who resigned on Monday . 
Chaiyawat , the former deputy finance minister , was appointed as acting finance minister on Tuesday by premier Banharn Silpa-archa . 
he replaced Bodi Chunnananda , who stepped down suddenly on Monday . 
Bodi told Reuters on Tuesday he resigned to avoid conflict with other ministers , but would not elaborate . 
&quot; I will cooperate with the top officials at the finance ministry , and I will continue the policies initiated by Bodi , &quot; Chaiyawat told a news conference . 
Chaiyawat said he would meet senior officials at the ministry and budget bureau to discuss the possible reduction of the government budget for the fiscal year which began on October 1 . 
the finance ministry last week suggested that the budget be cut because projected revenues might not meet the 984 billion baht ( $ 39.3 billion ) spending level set for the 1996 / 97 year . 
Chaiyawat said he would wait before making any moves on new bank licences until the outcome of an investigation into an alleged kickback scandal is formally presented to cabinet . 
a scandal erupted several months ago when former justice minister Chalerm Yoobamrung alleged that politicians were receiving kickbacks worth about 750 million baht ( $ 30 million ) for each new license . 
a committee appointed by the government to investigate the allegations has said they were groundless , but the findings have not yet been formally presented to the cabinet . 
Chaiyawat also said he would also continue to work to upgrade seven foreign bank offshore representative offices to full bank branches .
