Latvian Prime Minister Andris Shkele , whose government has suffered a series of ministerial resignations and a bout of political in-fighting , said on Friday that he would hand in his own resignation next week . 
&quot; I will on Monday hand in to the president an announcement about the end of the powers of my government , &quot; Shkele told a news conference . 
Shkele , a non-party businessman who first came to power in late 1995 , has been undermined by the resignations of four ministers on anti-corruption charges and a deepening confrontation between himself and the seven parties which form the government . 
he has been credited with helping push ahead the reforms which Latvia launched after it quit the former Soviet Union in 1991 but his relations with the parties that form the government have been tense from the start . 
he presented a plan earlier this week to save the government but this has been rejected by the ruling parties . 
&quot; I was told that it had been a mistake to place a ( politically ) unaffiliated person at the head of the government and I was accused of destroying party democracy , &quot; Shkele added .
