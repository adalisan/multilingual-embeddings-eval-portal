business slowed down in the UK equity options market by early afternoon as traders waited for inflation data from the U.S. , dealers said . 
if the U.S. consumer price index ( CPI ) for February is higher than the expected 0.2 percent monthly rise , this will raise expectations of a rate hike in the U.S. and will send markets lower , they added . 
possibly anticipating this , in the European-style FTSE options , the biggest deal was a purchase of 6,000 April 3925 puts at 4-1 / 2p which will turn in a profit if the index falls . 
also bearish was the main deal in mobile phone company Orange where a split synthetic short sale was established . 
it involved buying 600 June 200 puts at 8-1 / 2p and selling 600 June 220 calls also at 8-1 / 2p . 
if the share price falls sufficiently profits will come from the long puts . 
but using two different strike prices allows the trader some room for error if the underlying shares go up . 
if at expiry the shares are anywhere between 200p-220p both options will be worthless and the trader will not make a profit or a loss , before dealing costs . 
losses will arise if the shares go above 220p . 
Orange shares gained 1-1 / 2p to 207-1 / 2p . 
elsewhere , in banking group HSBC , the main deal was from a seller of 400 April 1500 puts at 25p . 
dealers also reported some closing out of positions in stock options having a March expiry .
