Sweden and Latvia reached an agreement on visa-free travel between them on Monday but Sweden said the deal would not become valid until Latvia signed the Geneva convention on refugees without regional reservations . 
&quot; Many countries have made certain amendments to , or interpretations of , the Geneva convention but we think Latvia has made too many reservations , &quot; a spokeswoman at the Swedish foreign ministry told Reuters . 
&quot; In particular , Latvia only acknowledges refugees from a limited number of countries . 
Sweden objects to those regional reservations and expects Latvia to change them , she said . 
the deal follows negotiations in Riga on March 24-25 , the Swedish foreign ministry said in a statement . 
earlier this year Sweden lifted visa requirements for the two other Baltic countries , Estonia and Lithuania .
