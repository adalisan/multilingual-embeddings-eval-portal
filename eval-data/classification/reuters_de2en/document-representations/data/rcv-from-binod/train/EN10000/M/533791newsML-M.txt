the Thai government has yet to conclude a deal to buy 10,000 tonnes of rubber although a deal appeared imminent , an official at southern hat Yai rubber auction market said on Wednesday . 
the original offer prices ranged between 110.00-123.50 US cent a kg while the government had bid 109.00 cents a kg , the official told Reuters . 
&quot; Some sellers have already agreed to sell at 109.00 cents . 
the deal is likely to be concluded soon , &quot; he said , adding that the lots will be for May shipment . 
the government tried to purchase 5,000 tonnes of RSS3 earlier this month but the deal did not go through as the offered prices were much higher than the level at which it was willing to buy .
