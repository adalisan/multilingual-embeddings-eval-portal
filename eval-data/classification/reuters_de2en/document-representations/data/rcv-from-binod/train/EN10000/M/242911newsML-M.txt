European bourses closed sharply higher on Monday after a firmer Wall Street calmed nerves and a coterie of top finance officials moved to convince the markets that &quot; grey Friday &apos;s &quot; global turmoil was an overreaction . 
the dollar also took heart and ended a full pfennig higher , buoyed by the recovery in global stocks and bonds . 
pouring oil on troubled waters were U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , Bank of England Governor Eddie George and Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer , all of whom said last week &apos;s reaction to remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan was overdone . 
it was Greenspan who sparked Friday &apos;s global selloff by warning about &quot; irrational exuberance &quot; in asset markets . 
the dollar and bonds were also dragged down . 
bourses in London , Paris and Frankfurt all rebounded and London and Frankfurt closed near session highs after New York stocks made a solid advance . 
by the time European business closed , the Dow was up around 40 points or 0.7 percent . 
on the London Stock Market investors shrugged off Friday &apos;s 88 point slide in the FTSE 100 index -- the London market &apos;s biggest one-day percentage loss in more than two years . 
a robust early performance on Wall Street and continuing evidence that institutional investors on both sides of the Atlantic are still awash with cash helped push the index up 48.6 points to 4,011.6 by the close on Monday . 
&quot; You cannot go against the huge amount of institutional funds coming into this market , &quot; one head of trading at a major investment bank said . 
trading volume was a meagre 480 million compared with an average daily volume of 760 million the previous four sessions , reflecting the market &apos;s overall wariness of a Wall Street which has jumped nearly 28 percent , or over 1,300 points so far this year . 
sentiment was affected however by the latest outbreak of hostilities over Europe in the ruling Conservative party . 
&quot; Euro-sceptic &quot; members of parliament called a press conference after Prime Minister John Major , in a weekend television interview , said he would not be bullied over policy towards the European Union . 
some MP &apos;s have called for the sacking of Chancellor ( finance minister ) Kenneth Clarke after he refused to rule out joining the planned European single currency . 
two bright stocks in London were Anglo-Austrian diversified manufacturer BTR , which rose on positive comment after its trading statement , and tobacco and financial services company B.A.T , which firmed amid fresh merger talk . 
in Frankfurt German shares extended morning gains of almost 2.5 percent gains in afternoon electronic dealings as sentiment was buoyed by the firmer Dow and stronger dollar , which makes German exports more attractive . 
in floor trading the 30-share DAX index of bourse activity closed up 65.28 at 2,857.24 . 
a centre of attention was Volkswagen , which jumped on news that VW chief Ferdinand Piech was going to convey regrets to U.S. auto giant GM over the industrial espionage row between the two companies . 
on the Paris bourse shares closed higher but a last-minute bout of profit-taking pulled them off the day &apos;s peaks . 
the blue-chip CAC-40 index ended up 15.12 points or 0.67 percent at 2,255.84 , recouping only a fraction of the 2.26 percent it lost on Friday . 
in currency trading , analysts said the focus had switched from the shaky U.S. stock and bonds markets of last week to intensifying negotiations over European monetary union . 
speculation was mounting Germany would cut rates again soon in return for a deal at next weekend &apos;s Dublin summit for a much more fiscally stringent stability pact than most countries would like . 
&quot; If that &apos;s not forthcoming this week ... it could herald another upward spike in the dollar above 1.56 marks as the forex market buys the dollar on a flight to quality argument again , &quot; said David Brown , chief economist at Bear Stearns . 
after a meeting in Nuremberg with French President Jacques Chirac , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said neither France nor Germany wanted a soft single currency . 
however , delegation sources said there was little progress on the stability pact to ensure fiscal discipline within EMU . 
the dollar was quoted at 113.80 yen and 1.5580 marks against 112.95 yen and 1.5465 marks in late Europe on Friday .
