European bourses perked up strongly on Friday , cheered by weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs figures which banished immediate worries of higher interest rates . 
but the dollar was virtually unchanged against the mark after a confusing reaction to the data . 
the figures showed unemployment rose last month as the number of jobs in the world &apos;s most powerful economy shrank for the first time since January . 
but the closely-watched statistics were regarded as good news by European bourses as the latest snapshot of U.S. economic strength meant fears of higher interest rates were receding . 
the best performer was Frankfurt , which shot to a new trading high of 2,703.59 points on the computerised IBIS index as the U.S. figures were flashed onto dealing screens . 
Frankfurt floor trading had also ended at a record close of 2,683.28 points , helped by the dollar &apos;s recent strength against the mark , which boosts export prospects . 
London and Paris also climbed strongly as news broke that the number of non-farm U.S. jobs declined by 40,000 , confounding market expectations of a 166,000 rise and a far cry from August &apos;s 241,000 increase . 
&quot; This is far weaker than expected . 
we could get to a Dow 6,000 right here , &quot; said Philip Orlando , chief investment officer at value Line Asset Management in New York as Wall Street opened and quickly spurted up by 0.5 percent . 
the Dow Jones industrial average of U.S. blue chip share prices currently trades around 5,960 . 
recent data on the powerhouse U.S. economy has been erratic but most has generally pointed to slowing in manufacturing , prompting policymakers last week to leave interest rates unchanged , at least until their next meeting in mid-November . 
London stocks , in the doldrums amid nervous trading before the American data , climbed quickly as the figures sent government bonds soaring . 
&quot; The manufacturing side is so weak and it makes it much less certain there is going to be a rate increase at the next FOMC meeting , &quot; said SGST economist Brian Hilliard , referring to the U.S. central bank &apos;s Federal Open Markt Committee . 
French shares surged ahead by 0.6 percent after sagging earlier in the day . 
the shock fall in American jobs sent the dollar zig-zagging against the mark , only to wind up little changed from where it began the European day at about 1.5290 marks . 
U.S. bonds jumped in response to the data but the dollar was less convinced . 
&quot; The foreign exchange market doesn &apos;t honestly know what to do with it , &quot; said Graham cocks , vice-president , treasury at Bank of Boston in London . 
the U.S. currency dipped initially after the data emerged before jumping to a session high of 1.5333 against the mark . 
but as U.S. bonds retraced slightly , so did the dollar . 
&quot; Basically this confirms and validates everything the Fed &apos;s been doing , &quot; said Von Maydell , who is senior currency economist at UBS in London . 
analysts said the payrolls data sharply reduced the chances that the U.S. Federal Reserve would hike interest rates at its next policy-making meeting on November 13 . 
the decision to hold rates steady at last month &apos;s meeting took many by surprise . 
the dollar traded around 111.53 yen and 1.5290 marks versus Thursday &apos;s late European levels of 111.47 and 1.5291 . 
London - The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares was up 15.8 points at 4,015.8 . 
Paris - The CAC-40 share index was up 17.44 points at 2,153.45 . 
gold was fixed at $ 380.70 an ounce in the afternoon versus Thursday &apos;s close of $ 379.35 . 
silver was up two cents at $ 4.93 .
