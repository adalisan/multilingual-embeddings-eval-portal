defence Secretary William Perry and three U.S. senators will visit Moscow next week to discuss closer military ties and urge Russia to ratify deeper cuts in nuclear warheads , the Pentagon said on Thursday . 
in a three-day visit beginning on Wednesday , Perry will meet Defence Minister Igor Rodionov and speak to the State Duma , the lower house of Parliament , to press for ratification of the Start-2 strategic arms reduction treaty signed in 1993 and approved by the U.S. Senate this year . 
democratic Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut , and Republican Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana will go with Perry . 
Nunn and Lugar sponsored a law that has sent millions of dollars to help finance nuclear cuts in the former Soviet Union . 
the trip comes at a key time for relations between the former Cold War foes . 
Washington is anxious to help reform Russia &apos;s struggling military under democratic civilian control and is pressing ahead on bringing former Soviet-allied East European states into the NATO alliance . 
Start-2 would require the United States and Russia to slash their nuclear arsenals to between 3,000 and 3,500 long-range warheads each by the year 2003 , a reduction of some two-thirds from Cold War levels . 
the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty by an 87-4 vote last January 26 but objections have been raised in Russia , where the economy and military forces are in turmoil . 
some legislators fear major nuclear cuts could leave Moscow vulnerable to pressure from the West . 
Perry and the senators are expected to hold talks with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin but it was not immediately clear whether they will meet outspoken Russian security chief Alexander Lebed . 
Perry and Rodionov , an army general , met last month at a gathering of NATO defence ministers in Bergen , Norway , and Rodionov promised to continue improving Russian military ties with the alliance despite Moscow &apos;s objections to NATO expansion into Eastern Europe . 
Lebed visited NATO headquarters in Brussels this week and said Russia would not try to stand in the way of the alliance &apos;s planned eastwards expansion to include such countries as Poland , the Czech Republic and Hungary . 
but he urged careful and slow movement in that direction . 
before returning to Washington , Perry and the senators will visit a Russian naval base near Arkhangelsk at the edge of the Arctic to watch the destruction of former Soviet missile submarines under the Start-1 arms reduction treaty . 
last year , Perry visited Engels Air Base in Russia , where Cold War long-range bombers are being cut up into scrap under the terms of the treaty . 
Russia &apos;s conventional military forces , hammered by deep spending cuts , suffered a major setback in the conflict in Chechnya , and both Lebed and Rodionov have warned of major unrest in the ranks over lack of pay and even food supplies . 
Rodionov , appointed to the top defence post by Yeltsin in July after Yeltsin sacked former Defence Minister Pavel Grachev over Chechnya , wants to cut Russia &apos;s armed forces to 1.2 million from 1.5 million . 
but he has conceded that it will cost huge sums of money to make such cuts and to replace Russia &apos;s conscript force with a smaller professional military promised by Yeltsin .
