the trade ministers of Canada , the United States and Mexico agreed Thursday to speed up tariff reductions on a number of goods called for in the North American Free Trade agreement , trade officials said . 
trade officials said the NAFTA ministers agreed at a meeting in Washington to accelerate the reduction of duties on about 75 tariff items , including household items , pharmacueticals and airplane parts , starting July 1 . 
they also agreed to discuss further tariff cuts and conclude those talks by December 15 , trade officials said . 
&quot; We &apos;ve had a most productive day , &quot; Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton told reporters following a meeting of the NAFTA commission and a bilateral session with U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky . 
he said the group noted that trade between the three countries is up 45 percent since the accord was signed three years ago . 
bilateral discussions with U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky covered a number of issues including the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba and the U.S. &apos; Helms-Burton law , aimed at curbing foreign investment in Cuba , Eggleton said . 
&quot; I reiterated our strong opposition to Helms-Burton and our determination to vigorously oppose this legislation until one day it is repealed , &quot; Eggleton said . 
he said the two also discussed the recent flap over Cuban-made pajamas being sold in Wal-Mart stores in Canada . 
the U.S.-based retailer was stuck in a cross-border tug-of-war over the pajamas because of the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba and a Canadian law that punishes firms for adhering to foreign legislation such as the Helms-Burton law that punishes firms for doing business with Cuba . 
&quot; We expect companies incorporated in Canada to abide by Canadian laws , &quot; Eggelton said .
