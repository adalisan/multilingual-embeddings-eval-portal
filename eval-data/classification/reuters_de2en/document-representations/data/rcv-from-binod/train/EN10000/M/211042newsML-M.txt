Asian dollar deposit rates were little changed in featureless trade , dealers said on Friday . 
they said most traders were sidelined ahead of tonight &apos;s release of the U.S. October import / export and Federal Budget data . 
in September , import prices rose 0.8 percent but export prices fell 0.8 percent . 
the Federal Budget for October is forecast to have narrowed to US $ 32 billion compared with September &apos;s $ 35.37 billion . 
&quot; The market was quiet and featureless in the morning due mainly to an absence of fresh incentives . 
some people are waiting for possible direction from tonight &apos;s release of the import / export and federal budget numbers , &quot; a local dealer said . 
&quot; But I don &apos;t think there will be much impact here as the numbers have been into the market and most people have squared or are squaring their positions ahead of the weekend , &quot; he said . 
in day-to-day rates , weekend , Monday / Tuesday and week-fixed were unchanged from Thursday &apos;s common 5-3 / 8 5-1 / 4 percent , respectively . 
among longer dates , one-month was unchanged at 5-3 / 8 5-1 / 4 percent , three-months unchanged at 5-1 / 2 5-3 / 8 , nine-months unchanged at 5-9 / 16 5-7 / 16 and twelve-months unchanged at 5-5 / 8 5-1 / 2 percent .
