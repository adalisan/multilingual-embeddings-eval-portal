the price of palm oil needs to fall to regain its competitive position in the vegetable oil market but it seems set for a fairly soft landing in coming weeks , traders said . 
&quot; We are not going to see anything dramatic happen on the palm oil market but once people have seen the Malaysian Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority ( PORLA ) figures at the weekend we may get some idea where we go from here , &quot; said one trader . 
most European traders agree palm oil is over-priced against soft oils , but they dispute the timing of any price fall or even whether it will happen at all . 
&quot; February is always a low production month owing to the holidays in the Far East and we are going to see speculators playing on this for a while , but it can &apos;t last for ever , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; I think the market still has some upside in it , but it will soon top out , &apos; said another . 
some traders said Indonesia may hold the key to the market . 
&quot; At the moment the Indonesians are holding local prices down and are likely to do so until their election in March . 
this may make some people , who up until now have been bullish , give up on the market , &quot; said a trader . 
others said some players were tired of the market and had taken their profits and not been seen since . 
traders said Pakistan had been expected to return to the market but so far has not made a move . 
&quot; Prices in Pakistan are high and their stocks are low , so they should be making an appearance but they have not been seen yet , &apos; said one . 
prices are still too high for China even after its recent cut in palm oil import duty . 
&quot; China still cannot afford palm oil and while prices stay at their current level we won &apos;t see any major buying from them , &quot; said another trader . 
traders said it could be the middle of next week before any trend is seen . 
&quot; A lot of people in Malaysia are still on holiday and won &apos;t return until Monday , which will slow the market down , &quot; said one trader 
&quot; We need to see what PORLA has to say at the weekend and get some idea of the export situation next week , also hear what whispers are coming out of the plantations on production , &quot; the trader added .
