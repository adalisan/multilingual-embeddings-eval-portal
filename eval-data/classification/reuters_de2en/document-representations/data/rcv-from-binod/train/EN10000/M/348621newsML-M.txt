Jakarta share prices recovered at the close on Friday after briefly losing their upward momentum on local selling , brokers said . 
they said the stock market performed well throughoout the day despite unfounded rumours of trouble in the west Java city of Bandung . 
brokers said the rumours made people nervous but failed to dampen overall market sentiment , unlike the foreign exchange market which saw the rupiah dip but recoup later . 
they said people were nervous in the aftermath of Thursday &apos;s riots in Rengasdengklok , east of Jakarta . 
however , the composite index rose 0.56 percent , or 3.82 points , to close at 691.12 points after easing briefly to a low of 687.87 late in the afternoon . 
it was up 12.2 points , or 1.8 percent , on the week . 
one foreign broker said late profit-taking including margin calls , starting with heavy selling of Mayora shares , triggered some follow-through sales in other major second-liners . 
&quot; But short-covering by local players seemed to have outweighed profit-takers , helping the index to edge up again , &quot; the broker said . 
another said late entry of Telkom buyers had also given a lift to the index which was hovering around the record zone . 
Mayora saw sudden heavy unloading , sending its shares down almost seven percent to close at 1,025 rupiah . 
brokers were unclear of any fundamental reasons , but some said late orders from Hong Kong had caused the consumer firm to dip . 
Telkom rose 75 rupiah to 4,250 rupiah . 
brokers said top performer of the day was PT Tambang Timah which soared 20.24 percent to 5,050 rupiah in moderate trading . 
they attributed it to the signing of an MOU with Mohammad Hasan to take part in the Busang gold project . 
brokers said foreign buying in heavy-weight cigarette counters continued to stabilise market sentiment and the index . 
Gudang Garam and Sampoerna edged up on healthy buying . 
multipolar was actively traded , with volume approaching 18 million shares . 
its stock posted a two-point gain after winning shareholders &apos; approval to take a 50.1 percent controlling interest in retailer Matahari Putra Prima . 
Bakrie Brothers was also actively traded after confirming its plan to sell its 49-percent share of Indocopper Investama Corp. 
the firm has a stake in PT Freeport Indonesia , but the deal is subject to shareholders &apos; approval in March . 
Bakrie closed up 25 rupiah to 1,175 rupiah . 
brokers said other arguments for supporting Bakrie included a plan to also sell 20 percent of its stake in coal mining firm PT Arutmin . 
brokers said Lippo Life was well supported following reports of the revision of its 1997 profits . 
its shares rose almost three percent to 2,875 rupiah on moderate volume . 
other active counters included Bhuwanatala , multipolar and Barito Pacific .
