London cocoa futures showed a familiar reluctance to abandon cosy ranges with Wednesday &apos;s thin market focusing mainly on the March contract . 
the closing volume was 2,937 lots , half of which came from March outright and March / March switches trading at 75 and 70 stg . 
price fixing by origin shippers was cited at the top . 
&quot; It looks like the market is stuck in a range between 900 and 950 stg basis March , &quot; said one trader . 
the benchmark March contract finished dealings one stg lower on the day at 930 stg a tonne after failing an earlier attempt to fill a chart gap between 940 and 941 stg . 
traders said sterling &apos;s movements continued to be an influence as it resumed a steadier tone . 
but they disregarded comments by a senior Ivorian diplomat who said production was likely to be between 850,000 and 900,000 tonnes . 
the projection came in lower than some trade estimates that viewed the Ivorian outout this season at around one million tonnes . 
but Ivorian government officials foresee a smaller crop . 
&quot; So far estimates by the Ivorians were between 850,000 and 950,000 tonnes . 
so 900,000 is not going to set the market alight , &quot; said one . 
in other news , Ivorian exporters and traders pegged the total arrivals by December 7 at between 330,000 and 350,000 tonnes , down from an estimated 410,000 tonnes this time last year . 
in London , E.D. &amp; F. 
man , Credit Lyonnais rouse and SFH were the biggest buyers of March . 
SFH also sold the Sept and Dec contracts into the close , traders said . 
the nearby Dec / March switch traded at 52 stg at the close . 
technical support is pegged at 920 stg while the initial upside target is the recent high of 956 .
