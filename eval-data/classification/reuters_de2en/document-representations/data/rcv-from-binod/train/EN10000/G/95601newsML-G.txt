Monica Seles has withdrawn from the European indoor Championships in Zurich later this month after beginning a new rehabilitation programme in an effort to avoid surgery on her injured left shoulder . 
Seles began what is expected to be a month-long rehab programme immediately after leading the United States to the Fed Cup title last weekend , her publicist announced in a release on Friday . 
the co-world number one had put off starting the programme , which will keep her from competing , so that she could play the U.S. Open and Fed Cup final . 
&quot; I was looking forward to Zurich , &quot; Seles said of the event set to begin October 14 . 
the left-hander suffered a small tear in the lining of her left shoulder socket during the Australian Open in January . 
Seles won the Australian Open , but the injury sidelined her several times during the year and often causes pain when she serves . 
it was not immediately clear whether the programme would affect Seles &apos;s ability to play in the season-ending WTA championships in November or when she might undergo surgery if the results are not satisfactory .
