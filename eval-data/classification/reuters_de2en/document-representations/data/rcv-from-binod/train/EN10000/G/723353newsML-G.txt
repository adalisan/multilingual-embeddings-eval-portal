Asian-Americans lashed out against what they described as racist remarks by Sen. Sam Brownback , a Kansas Republican , during Thursday &apos;s hearings on alleged campaign finance abuses , saying some lawmakers needed &quot; sensitivity training . 
Brownback apologized moments after mimicking an Asian accent and saying , &quot; No raise money , no get bonus , &quot; during his interrogation of Richard Sullivan , the Democratic National Committee &apos;s ( DNC ) former finance director . 
Brownback said no slight had been intended . 
but several Asian-American groups and other lawmakers took Brownback to task for his remarks and said it underscored concerns by Asian-Americans that the investigation into campaign finance abuses had reinforced racial stereotypes and xenophobic fears . 
&quot; That kind of behavior has no place anywhere in our society , much less in a United States Senate hearing , &quot; Rep. Nydia Velazquez , a New York Democrat and the first Puerto Rican woman elected to the House , wrote in a letter to Brownback . 
&quot; Your comment does , however , serve as a clear reminder that these proceedings have been used to impugn the reputations of Asian-Americans . 
this kind of stereotyping and scapegoating is offensive to all Americans , &quot; she wrote . 
Bob Sakaniwa of the Japanese American Citizens League lauded Sen. Daniel Akaka of Hawaii and Sen. Bob Torricelli of New Jersey , both Democrats , for their statements on the opening day of the hearings , urging that the proceedings be conducted in a fair manner that did not assign guilt by ethnic association . 
Akaka reminded panel members Tuesday , &quot; We are not here to conduct a witchhunt , &quot; but that is what many Asian-American groups feel the campaign finance investigation has become . 
many news reports have failed to differentiate between Asian foreign donors and Americans of Asian descent , regardless of how long they had lived in the United States . 
many Asian-Americans were upset when their legitimate campaign donations were questioned by the Democratic National Committee in the wake of allegations that improper donations had been funneled to the 1996 presidential campaign by foreign interests . 
Republicans have focused during the hearings on the role of John Huang , a former DNC official who prospected for donations from the Asian-American community , raising $ 1.6 million that has since been returned because it was deemed questionable . 
a group of Asian-American groups wrote a letter to the panel Tuesday urging its members to be careful when questioning witnesses , but they said their advice went unheeded by Brownback . 
Sakaniwa said there should be &quot; sensitivity training for the members on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee , who think it is okay to mock a person &apos;s culture or accent in a Senate hearing . 
Karen Narasaki , executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium , said the hearings were only in their third day , but had already begun to &quot; degenerate into stereotyping and demeaning imitations . 
&quot; What can we expect next week ? , &quot; she said in a statement late Thursday . 
&quot; Senator Brownback squinting his eyes and faking buckteeth ? 
the groups said Brownback &apos;s comments followed anonymous hate faxes and calls directed at Akaka -- but not other members of the panel -- earlier this week . 
&quot; One can only surmise that the orchestrated campaign was because of his ethnic heritage -- Asian , &quot; said Daphne Kwok , executive director of the Organization of Chinese Americans . 
the committee , which concluded its questioning of Sullivan Thursday , is scheduled to resume its hearings on Tuesday .
