Singapore &apos;s economy is likely to grow by only 6.4 percent this year , compared with 8.8 percent in 1995 and 10.2 percent in 1994 , a Reuters &apos; poll of leading financial institutions showed on Tuesday . 
the result of the poll of 11 economists , carried out just after Monday &apos;s announcement of a surprise 6.2 percent fall in the city-state &apos;s non-oil exports in September , is 0.1 percentage point below a similar Reuters &apos; poll conducted on October 18 . 
Monday &apos;s non-oil export figures were worse than expected and encouraged several economists to cut their forecasts for 1996 growth by as much as 0.5 percentage points . 
the result of the latest Reuters &apos; poll contrasts starkly with Singapore &apos;s most recent official 1996 forecast , restated by Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong as recently as September 24 , of &quot; seven to eight percent &quot; growth for 1996 . 
the poll left the average forecast for Singapore &apos;s gross domestic product ( GDP ) in 1997 unchanged at 7.0 percent year-on-year . 
most economists polled said their recent downward revisions reflected the impact of this year &apos;s downturn in the global electronics industry , on which Singapore is heavily dependent . 
electronics and related products account for about half the city-state &apos;s industrial production and almost 60 percent of its non-oil exports . 
Monday &apos;s figures showed a 23.7 percent year-on-year fall in exports of telecommunication equipment and a 16.2 percent fall in exports of electrical machinery in September . 
but economists said their lower growth forecasts also reflected a contraction in several other parts of Singapore &apos;s export-dependent economy . 
many economists said they had not had time to readjust fully their quarterly growth estimates in the light of the recent trade data but several shaved their forecasts by a few tenths of a percentage point . 
most expected Singapore &apos;s GDP growth in the third quarter to average slightly over 3.0 percent year-on-year . 
growth in the fourth quarter was expected to average 4.9 percent .
