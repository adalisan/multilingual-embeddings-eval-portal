Binyamin Begin , a chief ideologue of the Israeli right and son of late prime minister Menachem Begin , resigned from his cabinet post on Thursday in protest against Israel &apos;s agreement to cede West Bank lands to the PLO . 
&quot; It is impossible on my part to be a partner to handing over parts of our land , &quot; Begin told Israel Radio hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu muscled a deal to withdraw Israeli troops from part of the town of Hebron and rural areas of the occupied West Bank through his rebellious cabinet . 
science Minister Begin led the acrimonious right-wing onslaught against the Hebron deal in a stormy twelve hour cabinet meeting that approved the deal by a vote of 11-7 . 
the courteous 53-year-old geologist refused to compromise his belief that the entire West Bank , heartland of the biblical Land of Israel , must stay in Israeli hands . 
&quot; I thought it was correct to no longer be a part of a government ... I don &apos;t believe in , &quot; he told the radio . 
begin became the first member of Netanayhu &apos;s seven-month old government to walk out for his convictions . 
other ministers who opposed the Hebron deal said they hoped to fight against future Israeli concessions to the Arabs from within the cabinet . 
in his resignation , Begin remained faithful to father Menachem &apos;s staunch opposition to giving up West Bank land . 
Menachem Begin , the guerrilla-turned-peacemaker , made history when as prime minister he traded the Sinai peninsula for peace with Egypt in a 1979 deal . 
begin &apos;s rebellion showed the deep rift in the Israeli right opened by Netanyahu &apos;s reversal of earlier vows never to cede lands to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat . 
some on the Israeli right , dismayed by what they call Netanyahu &apos;s ideological betrayal , have pinned Begin as a natural candidate for a reconstructed right-wing party . 
begin , known for his quick wit and forthright manner , is deeply mistrustful of Arafat &apos;s intentions and tars him an unrepentant &quot; terrorist &quot; out to destroy the Jewish state . 
&quot; What we need now is to quickly sober up because what we ourselves don &apos;t understand , Arafat and his friends will explain to us .
