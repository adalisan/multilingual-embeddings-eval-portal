a buoyant dollar gave a leg-up to the mark &apos;s satellites throughout the European morning , setting the tone in the absence of influences closer to home . 
the French franc had recovered by midday after stumbling slightly when a new opinion poll predicted just a slim majority for the ruling centre-right in France &apos;s May 25 / June 1 election . 
market jitters that the French left could win power and usher in a more EMU-sceptical era were fanned by Socialist leader Lionel Jospin . 
he gave notice that his party would impose conditions on French entry into the single currency , and that he would seek an electoral pact with the Communists . 
however , Jospin -- who will meet Communist chief Robert Hue on Tuesday -- said yesterday that the Communists would have to accept Socialist policies if they were to govern together . 
analysts cautioned against reading too much into pre-election party pronouncements . 
&quot; Whatever the Socialists say , I don &apos;t think anybody seriously believes they would do anything to endanger EMU , &quot; said Ian Gunner , international economist at Chase in London . 
&quot; It &apos;s quite traditional in opposition these days for French political parties to be anti-austerity policies and , by implication , anti-EMU . 
the BVA poll for France 2 television and Europe 1 radio gave the centre-right 296 of the 555 parliamentary seats in metropolitan France , the Socialists 238 , Communists 18 , ecologists two and the extreme-right National Front one . 
more than a third of those polled said they could still change their minds . 
the French franc was quoted at 3.3712 / 16 to the mark at 1043 GMT , up from late Friday &apos;s European level of 3.3756 / 61 though off an early peak of 3.3695 . 
the Italian lira strengthened to 992.25 / 65 per mark compared to Friday &apos;s close here around 996.20 / 50 . 
in Italy , votes were being counted after Sunday &apos;s local elections . 
exit polls indicated the main opposition Freedom Alliance was leading the mayoral races in the key cities of Milan and Turin , while Ancona and Trieste appeared to have opted for the ruling centre-left Olive Tree coalition . 
with the local elections poised to further unsettle Prime Minister Romano Prodi &apos;s troubled government , analysts said political concerns would weigh on the lira . 
the likelihood that the Bank of Italy would delay an eagerly-awaited monetary easing even longer was seen as another negative for the currency . 
mild Italian inflation data last week stoked speculation of an interest rate cut which economists say Italy badly needs , but the weakness of the lira -- largely blamed on a shaky French franc and EMU worries -- was seen as having stayed the central bank &apos;s hand .
