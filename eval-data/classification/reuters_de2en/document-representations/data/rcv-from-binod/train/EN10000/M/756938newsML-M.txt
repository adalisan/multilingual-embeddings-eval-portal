Japan &apos;s National Mutual Insurance Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives ( Zenkyoren ) plans about 1.2 trillion yen worth of fresh investment in Japanese government bonds this fiscal year , federation officials said on Friday . 
&quot; We would like to continue to keep buying JGBs on a regular basis and to increase our overall investment in JGBs by about the same amount as last year , &quot; an official of the federation &apos;s securities division said . 
Zenkyoren , which collects insurance fees from members of agricultural cooperatives , had assets totalling 10.896 trillion yen as of the end of March 1997 . 
its JGBs holdings totalled 4.224 trillion yen , or approximately 39 percent of its total assets . 
&quot; We want to secure stable , long-term returns through our investments , and that is why our investments always centre around JGBs , &quot; the official said . 
however , Zenkyoren &apos;s investment in domestic bonds has been more diversified this year than in that past as it has increased its investment in government-guaranteed and municipal bonds as well as corporate bonds with high credit ratings , the official said . 
Zenkyoren &apos;s holdings in government-guaranteed , municipal and corporate bonds totalled 678.29 billion yen as the end of March 1997 , or about six percent of its total assets . 
the actual amount of JGB investment may also change depending on market conditions , the official said . 
&quot; If we feel the market is overheated , we may stop buying on a regular basis and we may eventually decide to sell to make up for a fall in income gains . 
we contemplated such selling in April of this year , &quot; he said . 
the official said such selling did not actually happen and that Zenkyoren &apos;s basic stance was to hold JGBs until maturity . 
the yield of the benchmark 182nd JGB yield fell to a record low of 2.075 percent in April . 
the current level of around 2.2 percent for the benchmark 182nd JGB yield was too low and unattractive , another Zenkyoren official said . 
&quot; We would like to avoid buying at the current level , &quot; he said .
