hundreds of South African car hijack victims flocked to a Johannesburg police station on Wednesday in response to an invitation to identify 11 suspected culprits . 
the head of a special police unit created last month to combat car hijacking issued the invitation on Tuesday , saying anyone whose vehicle had been stolen at gunpoint should visit the station to see if the assailants were among the suspects arrested the previous day . 
victims formed a queue on Wednesday stretching about 100 metres from the police station out into the street . 
&quot; In what is believed to have been a record for victims attending an identity parade a total of 210 persons managed to assist the police , &quot; a police statement said afterwards , adding that many more people had wanted to take part but had been put off by the length of the queue . 
the statement said another identity parade might be held to cater for the demand by would-be witnesses . 
the police unit investigated 400 reported hijacks in its first month of operation . 
hijacks , in which the drivers of vehicles are often killed , are part of a wave of violent crime in South Africa which has scared off potential investors and tourists . 
it is also cited as a major reason for emigration .
