the Philippine peso closed firmer on Friday at 26.399 to the dollar after the weekend swap points narrowed against previous day &apos;s , brokers said . 
on Thursday , the peso ended at 26.405 due to the three-day weekend arbitrage play . 
Thursday &apos;s deals were to be settled on Monday , since today is a U.S. holiday . 
traders usually buy dollars ahead of the weekend , so that they can still keep their pesos and earn relatively higher interest rates over the weekend . 
&quot; The swap points have narrowed because the pesos are held for only two days instead of three , &quot; one trader said . 
he said the foreign exchange market has substantially calmed after the fresh speculative attack on the peso last Wednesday . 
a total of $ 315.9 million changed hands with the Central Bank selling dollars at 26.340 to keep the peso from depreciating . 
by midday , some traders decided to unload their dollar holdings to the large interest rate differentials between the two currencies . 
the peso touched 26.397 , but Central Bank was seen quoting its bid at 26.398 . 
&quot; The dollar sellers then became buyers again , &quot; he said . 
Value-Tuesday deals ranged from 26.409 and 24.411 .
