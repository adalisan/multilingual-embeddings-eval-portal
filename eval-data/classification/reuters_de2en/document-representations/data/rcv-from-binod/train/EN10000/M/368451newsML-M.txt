German shares were sharply higher in early bourse trade on Monday despite mixed signals from the dollar which has been the engine behind recent gains . 
German stocks , rendered anxious by the pace of the record run of late , managed to overcome its anxieties to advance over one percentage point to 3,170.72 points , up 32.71 points . 
&quot; There is no U.S. data , nothing new here , so we are looking to technical factors , rumours and orders for a change , &quot; said one trader . 
a factor weighing on volumes in floor trade was the Fasching carnival , which runs until Wednesday and was expected to lead to a few hangovers disrupting trade on regional bourses , especially in Frankfurt and Duesseldorf . 
Tuesday afternoon is a half-day public holiday in many parts of southern and central Germany to celebrate Fasching , but Deutsche Boerse said that both IBIS DAX trade and bourse would take place as normal at the normal times . 
dealers said that a serious correction , which has been anticipated for some time as markets around the world hit records , was still some way off . 
&quot; While the momentum is there , let the cash roll in . 
we &apos;re looking for arguments to target new highs . 
this has been a fantastic year so far and people are wary of changing the scenario , &quot; a Frankfurt trader said . 
one of the big macroeconomic factors behind the equity market in coming months would be the success or failure of the coalition government &apos;s programme of tax reform . 
the weekend meeting of the Group of Seven ( G7 ) nations sent a mixed message to the market , signalling its strong desire for stability in currency rates by saying their currencies were not longer misalinged in a major way . 
&quot; The impact of the G-7 message has been limited . 
it seems to have put a ceiling -- however temporary -- on the dollar &apos;s rise . 
but 1.65 marks is still very high and so exporters are still profiting from this , &quot; the Frankfurt trader said . 
building company Hochtief AG was up after the magazine Focus quoted its management board chairman Hans-Peter Keitel saying he saw a future shift away from construction to more complex civil engineering projects . 
Hochtief was up 2.76 percent at 70.80 marks . 
Siemens AG was also higher in bourse trade , boosted by a series of positive analysts reports last week . 
the electronics giant was up 1.10 marks at 86.90 marks in floor trade .
