copper prices are likely to rise to $ 1.00 a pound ( $ 2,205 / tonne ) during the fourth quarter of 1996 , up from current levels of around 88 cents ( $ 1,930 ) , said a recent report from Bankers Trust Securities Australia . 
the bullish forecast is based on declining stocks during the first half of 1996 , a low stock-consumption ratio and rising copper consumption this year . 
bankers Trust also believed that Sumitomo Corp has unwound its long physical and futures position in the copper market and that the market appears to have factored in most of the additional copper supply coming on stream in 1996 . 
in the report Bankers Trust said latest available copper stock data shows they equated to just 3.6 weeks &apos; consumption , a level it called &quot; historically very low . 
on consumptiom growth , the bank is looking for a 3.2 percent rise in copper consumption in 1996 against 2.8 percent in 1995 . 
in 1997 demand is forecast to increase by 3.6 percent . 
while supply will rise more quickly this year at 6.4 percent , copper is still forecast to remain in a small deficit in 1996 of 200,000 tonnes . 
the report also said it believed Sumitomo has unwound its physical and futures position . 
&quot; currently , the market appears to have priced in nearly the worst possible scenario of Sumitomo having a reasonably large physical and futures position , &quot; the report said . 
the market also apparently has factored in expected additional supply this year . 
&quot; The market has priced in all of the bad news but appears to be overlooking the impact of the positive factors , &quot; Bankers Trust Securities Australia said . 
&quot; Therefore BT expects that ( the ) copper price will be 100 cents / lb in the fourth quarter 1996 . 
if anything , BT expects the copper price will surprise on the high side of this forecast .
