U.S. high-grade corporate debt supply and historically tight spreads began to weigh on outstanding issues on Tuesday , dealers said . 
conversely , high-yielders showed no signs of breakdown from recent strength with new issues upsized and quoted significantly higher when freed to trade . 
well over $ 1 billion in investment grade issues were priced on Tuesday , led by a typically tightly priced $ 500 million deal from Associates Corp. 
the notes , due in 2000 , were priced as 6-3 / 8s to yield 18.4 basis points over the Treasury curve . 
market sources said lead manager UBS Securities bought a large portion of the issue . 
other large issues included $ 300 million in 20-year debt from Swiss Bank New York , priced as 7-3 / 8s to yield 62 basis points over the curve via SBC Warburg ; $ 300 million five-year notes from Long Island Savings Bank , priced as 7s to yield 63 basis points over ; and $ 750 million three-tranche issue from A.H. Belo , priced by Morgan Stanley &amp; Co to yield 47 basis points over in five-years , 67 basis points over in 10 years , and 87 basis points over in 30 years . 
the Long Island deal was increased in size by $ 50 million . 
spreads on outstanding issues were one to two basis points wider in spotty activity , traders said , adding that the flow of new issues had some players avoiding the market altogether . 
&quot; The supply that we &apos;ve seen along with the lower interest rates and possibility that the flow ( of new bonds ) will continue everybody starts to fear they will get trapped with expensive or stale deals , &quot; said one West Coast trader . 
at the same time , the trader said &quot; it &apos;s the kind of day where you throw a bid out there ... if you see something you like it &apos;s time to go in and get some cheap bonds . 
cable sector bonds , which provided most fodder for trades on Monday , were thinly traded on Tuesday and spreads there were mostly flat , traders said . 
turning to high-yielders , Chemical Leahman Corp &apos;s $ 100 million senior note issue was seen trading up three full points to 102-1 / 2 late in the session . 
the B2 / single-B deal , upsized by $ 10 million , priced as 10-3 / 8s at 99.50 to yield 10.457 percent via lead manager Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . 
further , Globalstar LP upsized its B3 / single-B seven-year senior note issue by $ 125 million to total $ 325 million before pricing at a discount to yield 12.25 percent via Bear Stearns . 
Globalstar issued $ 500 million seven-year senior notes in February with an 11-3 / 8 percent coupon . 
however , the deal was priced as units with warrants for 1.78 percent of the company . 
also on Tuesday , precise Technology Inc sold $ 75 million 10-year B3 / B-minus senior subordinated notes at par to yield 11-1 / 8 percent via Bear Stearns . 
the high-yield calendar still includes about a dozen issues set for pricing this week . 
secondary high-yield prices were firm amid mildly weaker Treasury prices and a 60 point gain in blue chip stocks .
