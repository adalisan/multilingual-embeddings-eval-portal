figures in brackets compare against previous day &apos;s close 
the short end of the New Zealand yield curve ended a quiet Thursday session weaker but off its lows while the long end remained intact . 
selling in the short end was put down to weakness on the Trade-Weighted Index , which sank at one point to a low of 67.33 . 
by the close the TWI had regained some ground , ending at 67.42 . 
&quot; I think it ( the short end ) needed to do some work against the TWI when the Monetary Conditions Index was out at minus 0.82 . 
it needed to come off a little bit against the TWI , but since then the TWI has been looking reasonably solid , &quot; said one Wellington dealer . 
he expected a bid tone to emerge on Friday if the TWI holds . 
long bonds escaped the selling pressure and eased in yield by a few basis points . 
&quot; I think that fundamentally there are not a lot of reasons to sell our long bonds , &quot; the dealer said .
