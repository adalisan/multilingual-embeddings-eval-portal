Tajikistan &apos;s president held talks to resolve the country &apos;s hostage crisis on Sunday but a senior official in the mountainous former Soviet republic said there was no deal to free the 15 captives yet . 
&quot; No hostages will be released today , &quot; said the official , who asked not to be named . 
presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov , speaking after talks between President Imomali Rakhmonov and a warlord controlling parts of northern Afghanistan , said progress had been made . 
these parts of Afghanistan provide a refuge for Tajikistan &apos;s Islamic opposition . 
&quot; The results of Mr Rakhmonov &apos;s talks inspire confidence in a fast and peaceful solution to the hostage problem , &quot; Saidov said . 
he said further discussions would be held on Monday , led by Deputy Prime Minister Abdurakhmon Nazimov . 
the hostage crisis began on Tuesday when a group of Islamic opposition rebels seized four United Nations military observers -- an Austrian , a Ukrainian and two Swiss nationals . 
the rebels later captured four Russian reporters and their driver and four workers with the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR . 
Tajik Security Minister Saidamir Zukharov , who flew in to negotiate with the hostage-takers , was seized early on Saturday . 
the captors belong to a group loyal to Rizvon Sadirov , who once fought for Tajikistan &apos;s armed Islamic opposition but whose loyalties are now unclear . 
they are led by Rizvon &apos;s brother Bakhrom Sadirov , and are demanding free passage for colleagues based in neighbouring Afghanistan to return to Tajikistan . 
a United Nations representative had said he hoped the hostages could be freed on Sunday after the Tajik government promised to send helicopters to Afghanistan , pick up 40 rebels and bring them to Bakhrom Sadirov &apos;s base . 
but hopes of a quick end to the crisis have been dashed in the past . 
the Tajik authorities have issued daily statements saying that the hostages would be released but a helicopter sent on Friday to collect them returned empty . 
the crisis has marred celebrations to mark the end of the Ramadan month of fasting in the Moslem former Soviet republic . 
Russia &apos;s Interfax news agency , whose Dushanbe correspondent is among the captives , appealed to Sadirov to release them . 
&quot; We appeal to you as a military man and as a Moslem , on the occasion of the Ramadan holiday , to release the U.N. officials and the Russian journalists , first and foremost the women , who you are holding , &quot; the agency &apos;s appeal said . 
the captives are being held near the town of Obirgam which is in a mountaneous area some 80 km ( 50 miles ) east of Dushanbe . 
international humaniatarian organisations are already pulling out of Tajikistan due to the kidnappings . 
the International Committee for the Red Cross said on Thursday it was suspending operations in the Central Asian state , and non-essential U.N. personnel began leaving the republic on Saturday .
