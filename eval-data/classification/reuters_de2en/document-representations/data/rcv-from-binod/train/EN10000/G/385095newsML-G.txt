the number of issues that need a unanimous vote to become law in the European Union could be greatly reduced under a plan unveiled on Tuesday , as the EU &apos;s review of its treaties broached one of its most sensitive subjects . 
the cautious title of the proposal submitted by the Dutch EU presidency to EU foreign ministers &apos; representatives underlined just how explosive the issue is , especially in Britain which insists on keeping its veto over EU proposals . 
headed &quot; provisions which could form a working basis for examining a possible extension of qualified majority voting &quot; , the paper outlines 25 articles of the EU treaty where the veto could be abandoned in favour of qualified majority voting . 
they range from the right of movement and residence through industry , culture and the environment to the adoption of the EU &apos;s research plans and compensatory aid for imports of raw materials . 
Dutch Secretary of State for European Affairs Michiel Patijn said there seemed to be general agreement that the right of veto should not be touched when it came to constitutional matters , exemptions from the EU &apos;s border-free market rules and matters with a direct impact on EU expenditure and income . 
the proposed list of areas which could be settled by weighted majority was more tricky . 
&quot; There was a general agreement on the approach , but there was a lot of small print from the member states . 
we are not yet out of the woods , &quot; Patijn told reporters after the meeting . 
Britain &apos;s European Affairs Minister David Davis said last week that those who hoped a change of government would prompt a British change of approach to its veto risked disappointment . 
the EU &apos;s inter-governmental review of its workings is scheduled to wind up at the bloc &apos;s Amsterdam summit on June 16-17 and by that time Britons could have voted for a change of government . 
Patijn stressed there was no question of moving from unanimity to qualified majority on taxation matters and said Tuesday &apos;s talks did not broach the issue of voting on foreign and security policy and justice and home affairs issues . 
those issues will be the subject of separate talks , Patijn said . 
Britain gained a significant concession last week when its EU partners agreed it could be left out of plans to drop internal border controls EU wide .
