senior U.S. officials on Wednesday branded Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein a &quot; demon &quot; and said there were signs of a power struggle in Baghdad . 
reinforcing suggestions of instability in Iraq reported on Tuesday by a senior U.S. military source , White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry offered a terse but carefully worded assessment of the political situation in Baghdad . 
&quot; There are a great deal of complicated internal struggles for power &quot; going on , McCurry said in response to questions on that earlier report . 
it had claimed Saddam had put his wife under house arrest and was changing locations more frequently out of apparent fear for his safety . 
&quot; There have been some things that have happened there recently ... ( some ) that have been reported publicly that would indicate some internal machinations , &quot; McCurry said . 
White House National Security Adviser Samuel Berger , in an interview with wire service reporters , said of Iraq , &quot; Its not a normal place . 
there &apos;s obvious dissatisfaction . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see anything that is an immiment threat ( to Saddam ) but there is obviously lots of intrigue , &quot; Berger said . 
a senior military officer called reporters to his Pentagon office on Tuesday to say that various sources he considered reliable reported signs of increasing trouble surrounding Saddam , a bitter foe of the United States since U.S.-led forces ousted Iraqi invaders from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War . 
besides the reported house arrest of Saddam &apos;s wife , the military officer , who asked not to be identified , said Saddam was now moving around even more frequently than he usually does in order to ensure his own safety . 
he also said the Iraqi ruler &apos;s eldest son and heir apparent , Uday , might lose a leg to gangrene as a result of a December 12 grenade and machine-gun attack in Baghdad . 
against that background , McCurry said on Wednesday that Washington was &quot; closely monitoring &quot; the situation in Iraq . 
&quot; The president ( Bill Clinton ) also has foremost on his mind the threats to regional security , particularly in the Persian Gulf , &quot; McCurry said , noting there were no indications of a renewed threat to Kuwait . 
officials at the State Department , breaking with the usual diplomatic nicities , said Washington was not trying to cast Saddam in an evil light . 
&quot; We don &apos;t need to demonise him , &quot; said spokesman Nick Burns . 
&quot; He is a demon , and he &apos;s done it to himself . 
claiming the Iraqi leader breached terms of the peace accord that ended the Gulf War , ignored the human rights of his own people and &quot; lets kids starve because he builds palaces to himself , &quot; Burns said &quot; We haven &apos;t demonised him . 
he has become something quite dark in the landscape of the Middle East . 
burns acknowledged the comments on Saddam were co-ordinated . 
&quot; The U.S. government has a unified position -- Pentagon , State Department , White House , other agencies of the U.S. government -- on Saddam Hussein , &quot; he said . 
Saddam has been a thorn in the side of U.S. policymakers , who assumed the harsh economic sanctions imposed since the Gulf War would have long since undermined his ability to remain in power .
