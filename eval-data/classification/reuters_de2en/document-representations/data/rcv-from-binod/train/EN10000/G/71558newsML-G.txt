Japanese patrol ships on Monday repulsed a flotilla of Taiwan and Hong Kong activists trying to defy Tokyo &apos;s claim of sovereignty by landing on a disputed East China Sea archipelago . 
seventeen Japanese vessels backed by a helicopter thwarted eight landing attempts by placing themselves between the seven fishing boats and the uninhabited islands , claimed by Japan as the Senkakus but known to Chinese as the Diaoyus . 
&quot; Down with Japanese imperialism ! 
&quot; activists shouted as Taipei county assemblyman and flotilla organiser chin Chieh-shou chanted &quot; Charge ! 
charge ! 
charge ! 
&quot; from the Changchun &apos;s bow . 
&quot; Japanese dogs out of Chinese territory ! 
&quot; some of the 20 protesters cried . 
&quot; This is Chinese territory and these are Chinese waters . 
several Taiwan boats reached within 200 metres ( yards ) of one island where a Japanese flag could be seen fluttering above some abandoned buildings and a tower . 
all were repulsed . 
a lighthouse built in July by Japanese ultra-nationalists and the Japanese coast guard &apos;s September 5 expulsion of a Taiwan fishing boat have re-ignited a long-dormant dispute over the islands , claimed by Beijing and Taipei as well as Tokyo . 
the activists had vowed to remove the lighthouse and flag . 
the patrol boat crewmen , speaking only Japanese , ordered the activists to leave what they called Japan &apos;s territory , unlike the earlier confrontation when they spoke Chinese and flew a Chinese banner proclaiming Japanese sovereignty . 
no shots were fired and there was no physical contact , although there were several brushes within 10 metres ( yards ) . 
the Japanese made no attempt to board the Taiwan vessels . 
the Taiwanese pilots finally aborted the protest mission , saying rising seas made further landing attempts dangerous . 
&quot; We will go back again with more people and more boats , &quot; chin said en route back to Keelung harbour . 
&quot; We are confident that next time we will succeed . 
Japan &apos;s coast guard confirmed repulsing seven vessels , some flying Taiwan flags , but gave no details . 
&quot; As a matter of routine we warned them to move out , &quot; a coast guard spokesman said by telephone from Japan &apos;s southernmost island of Okinawa , which has jurisdiction over the islands . 
&quot; There was no trouble or direct clash , &quot; he said . 
the Taiwan group had hoped to plant the flag of the island &apos;s exiled Republic of China while the Hong Kong protesters carried the flag of its communist rival , the People &apos;s Republic of China . 
Chinese anger has swelled in Taiwan , Hong Kong , Macau and China itself over Tokyo &apos;s tolerance of the rightists &apos; actions and its view that its claim was not open to discussion . 
protests have become a near-daily occurrence . 
on Sunday , thousands of anti-Japanese demonstrators marched through Taipei streets and some of them took turns flogging an effigy of Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto . 
Taiwan pledged on Saturday to defend the Diaoyus by force if necessary , but only as a last resort . 
Tokyo &apos;s claim dates to 1895 , when Japan defeated China and seized Taiwan and other territories . 
Beijing and Taipei say Chinese claims go back centuries but both have resisted calls to expel Japan by force . 
Taiwan and China have been bitter rivals since a civil war split them in 1949 and the Republic of China government , defeated by the communists , took refuge on Taiwan .
