Mexico &apos;s buyback of outstanding Aztec bonds , announced late Tuesday , forms part of its strategy to decrease the country &apos;s financing costs , debt analysts said on Wednesday . 
the timing , however , may have thrown a few players , who were assured by the government last week that Mexico had no &quot; short-term &quot; plans to buy back any Bradies . 
&quot; It looks to me right now that if you are short you are in trouble , of course , &quot; said one New York-based debt analyst . 
&quot; It is part of the strategy of Mexico to change the debt profile , to lengthen it and to decrease the cost of the debt , &quot; Santander Investment analyst Lucia Domville said . 
&quot; A lot of people were expecting Mexico to call back the bond because they had the cash to call it back and it was expensive , &quot; she added . 
the finance ministry said the early redemption of the Aztec bonds would be financed by medium-term debt issues this year at a lower cost . 
the Aztecs had a coupon of six-month Libor plus 1.625 percent , with a floor level of five percent . 
Mexico originally issued $ 2.557 billion of the Aztecs in March 30 , 1988 , but between 1992 and 1996 it bought back outstanding bonds in &quot; private operations &quot; -- leaving only $ 1.058 billion outstanding . 
&quot; It saves them money and they can extract the value from the collateral , &quot; said Bankers Trust economist Carl W. Ross . 
Mexico &apos;s Finance Department said it would save about $ 80 million in financing costs and free up about $ 400 million in collateral with the operation . 
by way of comparison , the federal government &apos;s recent 10-year $ 1.0 billion global issue was issued at 335 basis point over U.S. treasuries , while the stripped spread for the Aztecs was about 517 basis points . 
&quot; I don &apos;t know if it pays with the par and the discounts yet but it certainly paid with the Aztecs , &quot; said a debt analyst , referring to the buyback . 
the buyback had been expected and was well-reported in the media , with officials , such as Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz hinting it would take place as part of the government &apos;s plan to retire more expensive debt for cheaper debt with better terms . 
but the timing threw a few observers , particularly as Deputy Finance Minister Martin Werner told analysts in a conference call last Wednesday that Mexico had no plans to do so in the &quot; short-term . 
&quot; In the short-term we are not looking at that , but in the medium-term we still think that collateralized debt is inefficient and that there are gains both to Mexico and to the market to take out that debt , &quot; Werner said when asked if Mexico could retire more Brady bonds . 
analysts said the move may have been a bit confusing , but not altogether surprising because Werner had said the collateralized debt was inefficient . 
in May last year , Mexico placed a 30-year bond and bought back outstanding par and Discount bonds with a market value worth about $ 1.75 billion . 
it placed a 20-year bond later in the year and used those proceeds along with other funds to buy back outstanding Discount Brady bonds worth about $ 1.24 billion .
