the United States said on Wednesday it was pulling about 40 diplomats and their dependents out of Cambodia but would keep the mission open . 
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the number of diplomats in the country would be reduced to 20 from 61 because of the &quot; uncertain security situation &quot; after days of fighting in Phnom Penh and other areas . 
burns told a regular State Department news conference that between 1,000 and 1,300 other Americans in the Southeast Asian state were being urged to leave over the next few days . 
he said although the Pentagon had made contingency plans for a possible military evacuation , it was hoped the diplomats and others could leave by civilian transport now that flights were being restored at Phnom Penh airport . 
the U.S. embassy in Bangkok was preparing to help those coming out . 
&quot; Fortunately the situation in Phnom Penh is quieter than it has been at any time over the last four or five days , &quot; Burns added , although he said there was still sporadic shooting in the capital . 
fierce fighting erupted over the weekend as forces of one co-prime minister , Hun Sen , ousted those of co-prime minister Prince Ranariddh . 
he said the Cambodian ambassador was being called to the U.S. State Department on Wednesday afternoon to be told of Washington &apos;s &quot; very serious concerns &quot; about reports of political killings that followed the fighting . 
burns said Ranariddh was on his way to the United States from France for meetings with United Nations officials in New York and would probably meet on Friday with Acting Secretary of State Thomas Pickering , who is standing in while Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is in Europe .
