two car bombs on Wednesday killed at least three people and wounded scores in the centre of Blida , 50 km ( 30 miles ) south of Algiers , said residents speaking by telephone from the garrison city . 
the first bomb exploded at about 10.a.m ( 0900 GMT ) in the souk al Ahad market in central Blida killing at least two and wounding many more , residents said . 
the second bomb went off in the main street in central Blida , killing one and wounding several others , said another resident . 
Blida , site of the army headquarters , is known as a Moslem guerrilla stronghold and a &quot; corridor &quot; for rebels to reach their hideouts in surrounding mountains . 
the blasts in Blida came a day after two car bomb explosions killed at least 12 and wounded scores in Algiers . 
Algerian newspapers said those bombs raised the toll in violence since the start of the Moslem holy month of Ramadan on January 10 to at least 150 dead and 170 wounded . 
no one has claimed responsibility but analysts believe the bombs are a message to President Liamine Zeroual that the Islamic fundamentalists remain a formidable force despite repeated claims by the government to have crushed them . 
Algiers residents reported leaflets posted in the Casbah said there would be 50 bombs during Ramadan . 
the Armed Islamic Group ( GIA ) had warned it would increase attacks during Ramadan . 
residents said military officers defused two booby-trapped cars set to explode in Algiers on Tuesday . 
more than 15 other bombs had been defused in the past three weeks , they said . 
about 60,000 people have been killed in Algeria &apos;s violence since early 1992 when authorities cancelled a general election that radical Islamists were poised to win .
