riot police separated government and opposition demonstrators in central Belgrade on Tuesday after fierce street battles in which a man was shot in the head . 
an eyewitnesses who saw the incident said the man was hit by a demonstrator who fired from a group of socialist supporters of embattled Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic . 
he collapsed with blood streaming from a head wound but an independent radio report said he was alive . 
the intervention of police in riot armour stopped fighting between rival groups who battered each other with sticks and iron bars while crowds from both camps converged on the headquarters of the opposition Zajedno ( Together ) coalition . 
the violence was the first in 35 days of Zajedno protests against election fraud by Milosevic &apos;s ruling Socialist party ( SPS ) . 
the SPS brought thousands of supporters under police escort from all over Serbia to stage a show of support outside the Zajedno offices where the opposition holds its daily protests . 
opposition spokesmen described the choice of venue was a clear provocation . 
there were fears the authorities would use the violence as an excuse to ban future demonstrations or even to declare a state of emergency . 
Milosevic , under threat of Western reprisals , had not previously used his police against the demonstrations , the biggest since 1992 when he used tanks to quell unrest . 
radio reports said the police beat people as they pushed the opposition crowd back to creat a buffer zone and allow the socialists to reach the site of their rally . 
an SPS official told beta news agency before the violence erupted that Milosevic might address his supporters &quot; if there were sufficient people . 
Zajedno , backed by the United States and other Western countries , is trying to force Milosevic to admit its victories in Belgrade and 14 other towns at local elections on November 17 , breaking half a century of socialist rule . 
its demonstrations , which reached a peak of 250,000 people , have grown into the worst crisis the authoritarian Milosevic has faced in nine years of power . 
Zajedno spokesman Slobodan Vuksanovic told Reuters : &quot; ( Milosevic ) is out of his mind . 
he has brought thousands of people to Belgrade , people who are not informed about this situation ... 
I am afraid it could be the beginning of civil war in Serbia and all responsibility is on Milosevic &apos;s side . 
Vuksanovic said an SPS crowd shouting outside Zajedno &apos;s headquarters three hours before the demonstration was due to begin were from Pec , a hardline nationalist redoubt in the southern republic of Kosovo . 
Kosovo Serbs were the shock troops who brought Milosevic to power on a tide of nationalism that set off the disintegration of former Yugoslavia in 1991-92 . 
other pro-Milosevic demonstrators milled in nearby Republic Square in case Zajedno switched its protest there . 
as the atmosphere of intimidation grew during the morning , the SPO party -- a Zajedno partner -- said its Belgrade bookshop was attacked by a group of unidentified men , at least three of them armed . 
Zajedno earlier rejected an appeal by Serbian Orthodox Patriarch Pavle to suspend its demonstration after he warned that the conflict risked turning into an armed confrontation . 
in a swipe at Milosevic , he coupled his plea with praise for the opposition &apos;s restraint during the campaign of protests . 
Zajedno was told the SPS mobilised 10,000 buses to bring demonstrators including factory workers for &quot; a spontaneous assembly of supporters of the peaceful and consistent policy of President Milosevic &quot; . 
workers have mostly ignored the intelligentsia-led marches . 
opposition sources said factory hands were threatened with reprisals , including the withdrawal of lay-off pay , if they refused to attend the socialist rally .
