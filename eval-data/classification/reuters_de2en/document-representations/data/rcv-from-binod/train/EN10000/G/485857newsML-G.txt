a Roman Catholic missionary group said on Thursday that Sudanese police had destroyed a chapel in the capital Khartoum during Easter but had been prevented from destroying two others because of resistance by local Christians . 
the Comboni missionaries , which are active in Sudan , said in a statement released in Rome that government authorities had ordered police to destroy three churches on Easter Monday . 
they managed to destroy the chapel of Terea but failed to pull down two others , Kalakla Qubba and Wad Amara . 
&quot; The police bulldozer found all the approaches to the chapels blocked by people who sat on the street while others packed the chapel , &quot; the statement said . 
the chapels targetted for destruction were multi-purpose centres set up by the Catholic Church to help displaced people from southern Sudan who moved to Khartoum for shelter and work . 
they are used for school , medical , social and religious activities and are run under government permits . 
the missionaries said the government had given no reason for its order to destroy the chapels , whose walls had been daubed with Islamic slogans . 
Sudan &apos;s Islamist government is under attack from rebels who want to oust it and who have been fighting since 1983 for more autonomy or independence for the Christian and animist south from the Moslem and Arab north .
