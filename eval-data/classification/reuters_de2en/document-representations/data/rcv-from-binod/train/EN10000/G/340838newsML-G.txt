leaders of Israel , the Palestinians , Egypt and Jordan will hold separate meetings with President Bill Clinton in the next two months , the White House announced on Wednesday . 
spokesman Mike McCurry said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would visit Washington on Feb . 13 , Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on March 3 , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on March 10 and Jordan &apos;s King Hussein on March 18 . 
the working visits had been expected but dates had not been set . 
McCurry said the trips were separate because there was no dramatic development in the peace process that would make a summit of the leaders necessary . 
&quot; With each of these leaders we can have a somewhat more comprehensive dialogue outside the emergency context of dealing with a specific event that requires immediate focus and attention , &quot; he said . 
one key objective will be trying to get Israel and Syria to revive peace talks that were suspended 10 months ago . 
the two sides have been in search of a formula to restart the U.S.-brokered talks . 
Israel &apos;s refusal to hand back the Golan Heights , a strategic plateau captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war , has raised Syrian suspicions that Netanyahu is not committed to peace . 
Clinton told a news conference on Tuesday there would never be a comprehensive peace in the region until differences between Syria and Israel were resolved and it would require the willingness of the parties to make peace . 
&quot; What our experience has been is that when both parties want to make peace , no matter how far apart they seem , we &apos;ve found a way to get there . 
if they &apos;re not sure it &apos;s time to make peace , no matter how close it seems to an outsider , we don &apos;t seem to be able to bridge the gap , &quot; Clinton said . 
Israel &apos;s previous Labour-led government , ousted in May elections by Netanyahu &apos;s right-wing coalition , broke off talks with Syria in March after Islamic suicide bombings in Israel killed 59 people . 
Syria demands that Israel resume the talks from the point at which they stopped , insisting that the previous Israeli government had approved the principle of full withdrawal from the Golan Heights . 
but Netanyahu rejects the principle of trading land for peace . 
there has been some talk of the two sides meeting in the spring to revive the talks . 
Israel &apos;s handover to Palestinians of most of the West Bank city of Hebron last week has prompted renewed interest in the long-stalled talks with Damascus . 
Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk appealed to Syria this week to use Hebron as a springboard to making peace with Israel . 
McCurry said the leaders would discuss various other regional issues . 
he said in some cases the visits were scheduled for the convenience of the leaders themselves and that the order of the trips was of no particular significance . 
&quot; These are all visits in which we will explore not only the bilateral regional concerns we have with these leaders but also seek to deepen and strengthen the Middle East peace process as we search for a just , comprehensive and lasting peace in the region , &quot; McCurry said .
