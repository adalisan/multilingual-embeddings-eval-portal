shares prices fell on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange ( JSE ) on Thursday , hit by a one percentage point hike in interest rates , dealers said . 
the all-share index fell more than one percent to 7,991.9 in early dealings as investors took fright over a move that would choke off domestic demand , denting company profits . 
the central Reserve Bank announced a one point increase in its key Bank rate to 17 percent on Wednesday night , effective from Thursday , triggering a similar increase in commercial bank lending costs . 
two of the country &apos;s &quot; big four &quot; commercial banks , Standard and ABSA , said they were raising prime overdraft rates to 20.25 percent from 19.25 percent and other leading banks were expected to follow suit later in the day . 
the rate move provided some relief for South Africa &apos;s battered currency , however , increasing returns earned on rand deposits . 
the unit firmed some three cents against the dollar to 4.6375 / 25 by 0800 GMT from 4.6650 / 6700 at Wednesday &apos;s local close .
