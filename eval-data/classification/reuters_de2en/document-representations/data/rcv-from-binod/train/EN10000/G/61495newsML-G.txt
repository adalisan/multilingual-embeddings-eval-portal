Ross Perot Wednesday blasted a commission &apos;s recommendation that he be excluded from the presidential debates , saying it was &quot; a major setback &quot; for democracy and voters &apos; rights . 
the Reform Party presidential candidate said his party would file a lawsuit against Tuesday &apos;s recommendation by the Commission on Presidential Debates and would seek a restraining order to delay the debates until a decision was made . 
the commission proposed that Perot be excluded from debates between President Clinton and Republican Bob Dole , saying only Clinton and Dole had a realistic chance to be elected the next president of the United States . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think this is democracy as the framers of the Constitution intended , do you ? 
&quot; Perot asked a large audience in a speech at the Commonwealth Club , a current affairs forum , in San Francisco . 
&quot; This is a blatant display of power by the Republicans and the large donors who fund their campaign ... , &quot; he said . 
Perot said the Reform Party would file a lawsuit in federal court against the commission recommendation and would ask the court &quot; to issue a restraining order to delay the debates until a decision is made .
