Singapore bunkers were supported by crude gains and firm sentiment caused by anticipation that cargo prices will rise later Friday , traders said . 
bunker 180-cst prices were quoted at $ 127- $ 128 and 380-cst at $ 122- $ 123 per tonne , little changed from Thursday . 
shipowners appear relaxed with some saying that they have already covered their requirements and others said they could afford to wait .
