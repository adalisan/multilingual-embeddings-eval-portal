former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said on Thursday that he was calling on Russian President Boris Yeltsin to resign because he had &quot; exhausted his potential &quot; both physically and politically . 
speaking to reporters in San Francisco , Gorbachev reiterated the call for Yeltsin &apos;s resignation that he first made in interviews with Russian media last week . 
I did call upon him to resign and then the political process should take its course according to the constitution , &quot; Gorbachev said . 
Gorbachev said he wished Yeltsin , who has heart problems , a quick recovery but he believed that &quot; both physically and politically the president has exhausted his potential . 
&quot; He ( Yeltsin ) has not been actually working for a few months and ... the country is for all practical purposes without a functioning president , &quot; Gorbachev said . 
Yeltsin has been in a Moscow hospital since Sept . 13 and faces a heart bypass operation in six to 10 weeks . 
Yeltsin , 65 , assured Russians on Thursday that he was still in charge of the country . 
Gorbachev said that , if Yeltsin stepped down , the prime minister would take over his functions and new elections would be held in three months . 
&quot; Who will be elected by the Russian voters is a question to be answered by them , &quot; Gorbachev said . 
Gorbachev , last president of the Soviet Union , was one of several candidates who ran against Yeltsin in the first round of Russia &apos;s presidential election this year but he won few votes . 
Gorbachev said that , as a Soviet Politburo member for seven years , he had seen how the illnesses of a succession of Soviet leaders , including Leonid Brezhnev , Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko , had made decision-making difficult . 
Gorbachev also said he thought it would be a bad idea for countries such as Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic to join NATO . 
that &apos;s out of the question . 
but certainly Russia would draw certain political and military conclusions . 
I don &apos;t know what kind of conclusions , but there definitely will be certain countersteps and do we need all this ? 
&quot; he asked . 
the former Soviet leader is attending the &quot; State of the World Forum , &quot; a five-day conference of politicians , business executives , scientists and religious figures from around the world to discuss social and economic problems .
