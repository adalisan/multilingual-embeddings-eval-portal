Chilean stocks ignored Wall Street and a cut in interest rates and closed narrowly lower Friday , as overseas demand grew scarce after being strong earlier in the week . 
the blue-chip IPSA index rose in early trade after Thursday night &apos;s 25 basis point cut in the interbank borrowing rate , then fell back and closed 0.21 percent lower for the day at 130.59 points . 
it was the fourth daily loss in a row . 
the all-share IGPA index was 0.06 percent off for the day at 5673.46 points on moderate volume of 14.7 billion pesos traded . 
&quot; The cut in interest rates was completely factored into prices . 
the effect was small , &quot; said one broker . 
others said the market was disappointed because it expected a 50 basis point cut , instead of 25 . 
overseas buying was down , and that was a factor , &quot; said one broker . 
prospects were unclear for next week . 
one broker said the IPSA would likely see a technical rebound early in the week . 
another said Chile still looked relatively expensive for foreign buyers . 
owners said blackmailers had dumped poison into yogurt jars Friday , but they later said the jars in question had been located and removed from shelves . 
electric firm Chilgener rose early on an announcement late Thursday that it had made it first incursion into the Peruvian power market with purchase of a stake in utility Egenor . 
but it fell later on news the government had decided not to accept its requests for changes to conditions imposed by the state environmental board , CONAMA , on Chilgener &apos;s expansion of its Renca power plant outside the city , brokers said . 
CONAMA said it would allow the expansion to go ahead but on tight environmental conditions , which Chilgener had appealed . 
after seesawing through the day , Chilgener ended unchanged from Thursday &apos;s close at 171.50 pesos .
