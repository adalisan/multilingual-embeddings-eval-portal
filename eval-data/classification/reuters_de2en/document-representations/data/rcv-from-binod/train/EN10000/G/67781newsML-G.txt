a state judge on Thursday temporarily released America &apos;s most notorious &quot; deadbeat dad &quot; for a three-month trial period in hopes it would motivate him to find a job and pay his ex-wife long overdue child support . 
Jeffrey Nichols , 47 , a commodities and precious metals investment adviser , owes $ 642,550 to his ex-wife , Marilyn Nichols Kane , for the support of their three children . 
in releasing Nichols on Thursday , Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Phyllis Gangel-Jacob also said she feels Nichols has &quot; thumbed his nose &quot; at a December 1995 agreement in which he pledged to pay his former wife more than half a million dollars and other obligations in back support . 
the judge said that Nichols has made &quot; little or no effort to find employment &quot; and ordered that he return to court in December with &quot; serious documentation about his employment . 
Nichols was arrested in August 1995 after moving from New York to Florida to Canada and to Charlotte , Vermont for five years in order to avoid paying Kane more than $ 9,000 a month in child support . 
he was released from jail in December 1995 but sent back in June when an angry Gangel-Jacob charged that Nichols had not made a serious effort to get a full-time job in his field . 
Nichols claimed at the time that he was broke , a victim of &quot; bad publicity &quot; and living off &quot; the good faith and fortune of friends &quot; who loaned him $ 25,000 in the previous six months . 
in the mid-1980s Nichols earned over $ 300,000 a year , his lawyer said , but suffered financial setbacks last year after his second wife Suzan got cancer . 
she died before his arrest last August . 
Nichols adopted two children with his second wife . 
three months ago Nichols pleaded guilty in federal court to violating charges under the 4-year-old Child Support Recovery Act , which makes it a crime to cross state lines to escape paying child support . 
Kane said that since Nichols &apos; release in December he has paid her $ 13,900 . 
she also said expects to get another $ 21,000 from proceeds from an auction of Nichols &apos; personal possessions .
