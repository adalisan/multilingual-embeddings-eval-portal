Prime Minister Romano Prodi won overwhelming support in parliament on Wednesday to send an Italian-led security force to Albania but at the cost of a rift with his hard left allies that has put his future on the line . 
the Chamber of Deputies ( lower house ) voted by 503 to 85 with seven abstentions to deploy the 6,000-strong multinational force , the first of its kind to be led by Italy . 
Prodi , facing his stiffest political challenge in 11 months in office , staved off an immediate government crisis when the centre-right opposition Freedom Alliance said it would vote with his centre-left coalition on a joint motion . 
but it exacted a high price for voting with the government , forcing Prodi into a humiliating admission that he was not able to muster a majority of his own on the policy after Communist Refoundation , a key ally , broke ranks and voted &apos; no &apos; . 
Refoundation &apos;s 34 deputies and parliamentarians from the separatist Northern League opposed the mission . 
freedom Alliance leader Silvio Berlusconi said opposition votes had saved Italy from becoming &quot; the laughing stock of Europe and the world &quot; and urged Prodi to dump his Marxist ally . 
he said his opposition bloc would consider lending support in parliament to a minority government . 
&quot; Take a decision ... we are ready to make our contribution , &quot; he told the debate . 
political sources said Prodi was to go later to see President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and inform him that his parliamentary majority had crumbled on the issue . 
they said Scalfaro , the supreme arbiter in Italian politics , was likely to send Prodi before parliament for a confidence vote to determine whether his government stands or falls . 
Prodi cannot command a majority in the lower house without Refoundation , whose deputies hold the balance of power . 
the split on Albania has highlighted the vulnerability of his coalition to Refoundation &apos;s casting votes on a difficult domestic agenda , including a drive to reform the welfare state to prepare Italy for Europe &apos;s planned single currency . 
coalition parties now want a thorough review of the alliance to assess whether the hard left can be brought into line on key economic policies . 
&quot; What we have to do now is seek a confidence vote on the government &apos;s programme . 
the vote must be on precise issues and not general matters , &quot; said Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini , leader of the centrist Italian Renewal party . 
Refoundation has said it will back Prodi on a confidence vote but party chairman Armando Cossutta appeared on Wednesday to lay down terms , signalling a potentially rocky ride ahead . 
&quot; If Prodi wants ( to win ) the confidence motion , then he should not enter into details , &quot; Cossutta told reporters . 
&quot; If we back the motion then we will vote for it with open hearts . 
if not then we will vote against , &quot; he added . 
the opposition supports the Albania force but , sensing an opportunity to embarrass the premier , had insisted that Prodi acknowledge that his parliamentary majority has been cut to shreds on the issue . 
Prodi took steps to meet the demand in his speech opening Wednesday &apos;s debate , noting that a Refoundation &apos; no &apos; vote in the Senate on Tuesday , when the government &apos;s own majority was enough to get its motion through , had shown he had problems . 
&quot; I declare now that if the dissent expressed by the Communist Refoundation group persists , I will go immediately to the head of state to inform him officially of the situation and await his evalution , &quot; Prodi said . 
Refoundation regards the Albania force as a neo-colonialist venture and says Italian soldiers will face unacceptable risks . 
the mission coincides with the 58th anniversary this week of the occupation of the country by pre-war Fascist Italy .
