CBOT soft red winter wheat futures closed higher on a strong rally in the soybean complex , traders said . 
support came from news the European Union may wrap up soft wheat exports from the 1996-97 campaign before the traditional end-April deadline . 
also the market found underlying support on evidence of strong stopping of the deliveries posted against the March contract , traders said . 
diminished concerns about flood damage to the U.S. wheat crop also limited gains . 
talk circulated last week that flooding in the Ohio River Valley could harm the wheat crop there but agronomists Friday said very little wheat would be damaged . 
USDA &apos;s weekly export inspections report did little to help the bull &apos;s cause . 
USDA Monday said 13.857 million bushels of U.S. wheat were inspected for export the week ended March 6 . 
there were expectations for 14 million to 17 million bushels . 
wheat ended 1-1 / 2 to 3-3 / 4 cents a bushel higher , with March up 1-1 / 2 at $ 3.76-1 / 2 . 
new crop July closed up three cents at $ 3.66-1 / 2 .
