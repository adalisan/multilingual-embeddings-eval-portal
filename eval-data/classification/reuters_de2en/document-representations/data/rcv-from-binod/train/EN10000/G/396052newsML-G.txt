Livewire batsman and fielder Jonty Rhodes and all-rounder Jacques Kallis were both recalled to the 12-man South African squad announced on Saturday for next week &apos;s first test against Australia in Johannesburg . 
Rhodes , who last played a test against India at Ahmedabad last November , is &quot; an important asset to the side for his fielding alone &quot; , said convenor of selectors Peter pollock in naming the squad . 
although Rhodes was unable to bat in Natal &apos;s second innings against Australia at Kingsmead on Saturday because of severe dehydration brought on by stomach problems , pollock expected him to be fit for the test at Wanderers . 
pollock said that Kallis , who comes into the side for injured all-rounder Brian McMillan after last playing at test level against England in Cape Town last January , would probably bat at number three . 
Adam Bacher was the likely 12th man . 
&quot; Brian ( McMillan ) is a vital part of our test line-up but he hasn &apos;t really played for a month and that dictated that we didn &apos;t consider him for the Wanderers , &quot; pollock said . 
Australia , fresh from their eight-wicket victory over Natal at Kingsmead on Saturday , will be without seamer Paul Reiffel for the opening test of the three-match series . 
Reiffel suffered a hamstring strain on the first day at Kingsmead and has been ruled out of the test which starts on Friday . 
early worries about all-rounder Steve Waugh , who twisted an ankle before the start of the third day &apos;s play at Kingsmead , were unfounded , captain Mark Taylor said . 
&quot; Steve will be fine for Johannesburg -- he just needs a few days &apos; rest .
