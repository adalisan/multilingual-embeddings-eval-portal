a newly appointed Bosnian Serb army chief told Western envoys on Saturday he was in charge after civilian authorities announced the dismissal of commander General Ratko Mladic , international mediator Carl Bildt said . 
&quot; My people have met with the new commander and the new deputy commander in ( Serb political headquarters ) Pale , who appeared with the minister of defence , &quot; Bildt told Reuters . 
&quot; They do exist and they claim they are in command . 
but the outcome of a power struggle between civilian leaders and the Bosnian Serb army was still unclear , Bildt said . 
Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic announced Mladic &apos;s dismissal earlier , saying international pressure had forced her to retire the indicted war criminal . 
a previous attempt by Serb civilian authorities to remove Mladic failed last year and NATO and Bildt &apos;s office had adopted a cautious stance until they could confirm the army &apos;s response . 
Bildt &apos;s aide , Bertrand de la Presle , a French general who once served as commander of U.N. peacekeeping troops in ex- Yugoslavia , met newly-appointed General Pera Colic and his deputy , Major-General Dragan Josipovic . 
Plavsic named the officers , who played no prominent role in the army leadership previously , in her statement announcing changes in the general staff . 
Bosnian Serb sources said a swearing-in ceremony for the new officers was scheduled to take place sometime on Sunday . 
while Bildt &apos;s aides held talks with the men who presented themselves as the new commanders , Bosnian Serb army generals were meeting in their headquarters in Han Pijesak to discuss the dismissals , Serb army sources said . 
the NATO-led peace force had recieved no confirmation from the Serb army recognising the order , spokesman Major Simon Haselock said . 
Bildt , international High Representative to Bosnia , said Serb political leaders insisted that this time the order would stick . 
&quot; They are very clear that yes , Mr Mladic has been replaced , &quot; Bildt said . 
&quot; On that point , I think we are near the end of the endgame . 
Mladic , indicted for crimes against humanity and genocide , is barred from holding public office under terms of the peace treaty . 
international pressure would now focus on extraditing Mladic to face charges before the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia , he said . 
Bildt said he expected Mladic , unlike other Serb generals , to spend his retirement in the Bosnian Serb republic instead of in neighbouring Serbia . 
staying in Belgrade would put Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in a difficult position just as he is trying to end his country &apos;s international isolation . 
apart from Mladic &apos;s status , it was unclear if Plavsic would succeed in dismissing a number of other top generals as part of a &quot; reorganisation &quot; of the army command , Bildt said . 
&quot; It does not seem to be entirely clear what is the state of affairs with the other generals . 
the extent of the overall changes and what effect that &apos;s going to have , that ... remains to be seen , &quot; he said . 
Serb civilian authorities in the government seat of Pale were now in a stronger position than the army a year after the end of the Bosnian war , Bildt said . 
&quot; The army is now in a weaker postion than it was a year ago , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Our impression is the army on the Bosnian Serb side is in a rather sorry state , due to financial neglect , organisational disputes .
