Russia &apos;s dynamic Nizhny Novgorod region votes for a new governor on Sunday in a run-off poll between a Communist and reformist that could have a ripple effect on the future of reforms in the entire country . 
on the face of it , the vote is simply to replace Boris Nemtsov , summoned by President Boris Yeltsin in March to join his team as a first deputy prime minister and speed up reforms . 
but the vote -- a closely fought race between the reformist mayor of Nizhny Novgorod city , Ivan Sklyarov , and Communist Gennady Khodyrev -- is an unofficial referendum on the country &apos;s painful transition to a market economy . 
the men finished almost neck and neck in the first round two weeks ago . 
results are not expected before Monday . 
&quot; This election will show whether the people of Nizhny Novgorod region appreciate the changes over the past six years and want reforms to continue , &quot; the financial newspaper Birzha said on Saturday . 
Nemtsov , a liberal who pioneered economic change in his region after he became governor in 1991 , is now a key member of Yeltsin &apos;s reshuffled cabinet and is committed to a series of radical economic steps intended to revitalise reforms . 
the election in Nizhny Novgorod is crucial for Nemtsov &apos;s future and maybe for reforms in Russia , Birzha said . 
&quot; If people reject reforms in his domain , how can he offer them for the rest of Russia ? 
&quot; it said . 
Nemtsov is widely seen as the standard bearer of radical reform and a potential successor to President Boris Yeltsin . 
Nemtsov &apos;s reforms have dramatically changed Nizhny Novgorod , a city of 1.5 million people on the Volga river some 420 km ( 260 miles ) southeast of Moscow . 
clean and businesslike , the city &apos;s streets are full of new shops and crowded little cafes -- a striking contrast to many other depressed and declining regional centres . 
&quot; Life is tough but thanks to Nemtsov everyone has a fair chance now if he is ready to work hard , &quot; taxi driver Pyotr said . 
he wants to change things . 
local Communist leaders noted after the first round that even among regional industrial workers , their traditional electorate , many had supported Nemtsov &apos;s reforms . 
&quot; Many workers are blinded by capitalist propaganda , &quot; the Communist Vybor Naroda ( People &apos;s Choice ) complained . 
but the outcome for Sunday &apos;s vote is far from clear . 
the Communists still have a vast field of potential voters among struggling medical and social workers , teachers and employees of some military enterprises -- many awaiting pay packets due months ago . 
support is also strong in rural areas . 
the Communists can hope for the votes of many impoverished pensioners , who make up a third of the region &apos;s four-million-strong population . 
dozens of top Communist officials from Moscow rushed to Nizhny Novgorod to back Khodyrev , 55 , who ruled the region as a Communist Party chief in the late 1980s and later became a well-off sugar trader . 
he is also backed , somewhat surprisingly , by nationalist , anti-communist maverick Vladimir Zhirinovsky . 
Nemtsov , worried by a possible Khodyrev win , visited the region last week to campaign for Sklyarov , who is 49 and less charismatic than his predecessor .
