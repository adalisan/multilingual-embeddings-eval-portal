Canadian bonds ended weaker on Tuesday as expectations grew that the U.S. Federal Reserve could hike rates as early as this month , analysts said . 
&quot; The market has taken this view that potentially there &apos;s a bigger chance of Fed tightening than what was believed coming out of Friday &apos;s numbers , &quot; said Michael Gregory , an economist and strategist with Lehman Brothers . 
&quot; Canada has basically gone along for the ride . 
the U.S. 30-year benchmark fell 29 / 32 to yield 7.02 percent . 
the spread between the benchmark bonds narrowed to 82 basis points from 84 points at the close of trading on Monday . 
U.S. treasuries sold off on early in the session after Reuters reported comments from a senior Fed official which aggravated fears of a rate hike . 
the official told Reuters there is a growing consensus among Fed policymakers that U.S. rates will rise 25 basis points . 
in Canada , bonds had weakened earlier in the session following the release of manufacturing data for July from Statistics Canada . 
the government agency reported July manufacturers &apos; shipments rose 3.0 percent , new orders rose 3.7 percent and unfilled orders rose 0.7 percent . 
the numbers were all higher than economists &apos; forecasts . 
in new issue news , the Municipal Finance Authority of British Columbia issued a C $ 100 million , 7.25 percent bond due September 25 , 2006 . 
the issue was priced at C $ 98.81 to yield 7.421 percent with a spread of about 21 basis points over the Government of Canada 8.75 percent bond due December , 2005 . 
the U.S. 10-year benchmark fell 24 / 32 to yield 6.83 percent . 
the spread between the two bonds narrowed to 53 basis points from 55 basis points at Monday &apos;s close . 
the three-month cash bill traded at 3.81 percent against the U.S. three-month bill at 5.31 percent .
