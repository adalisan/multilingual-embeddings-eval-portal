human rights groups urged the Commonwealth on Thursday to get tough on Nigeria , voicing hope that Britain &apos;s new Labour government made stronger action more likely . 
the activists said the situation in Nigeria had worsened since it sparked worldwide protest in 1995 by executing writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority rights activists . 
hunger was rife , independent voices were silenced , activists imprisoned and democracy was just a dream , they said . 
they petitioned ministers to expel Nigeria from the Commonwealth -- it has already been suspended -- and impose oil sanctions aimed at ousting its military leaders . 
&quot; Nigeria has not behaved according to international codes of conduct and therefore shouldn &apos;t be a member of the Commonwealth , &quot; Saro-Wiwa &apos;s son Ken Wiwa told Reuters . 
Wiwa was one of a stream of activists to address the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group ( CMAG ) , set up to monitor human rights and ensure good governance in member states . 
CMAG planned two days of talks to assess the situation in Nigeria and work out what steps to recommend to Commonwealth heads of government , who are due to meet in Scotland in October . 
a hushed and bowed Wiwa said he was reluctant to lobby the ministers , drawn from eight nations , but felt it was his responsibility to keep fighting for human rights and his family . 
&quot; This is all very painful for me . 
but there &apos;s unfinished business . 
I want the release of my father &apos;s body , a proper burial , so I can start to get on with the rest of my life . 
&quot; Serious sanctions &quot; are the only way to end military rule , said Ledum Mitee , head of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People . 
&quot; Nigeria should be made a pariah . 
the 53-nation Commonwealth , which largely groups former British colonies , suspended Nigeria two years ago and has imposed some sanctions . 
but it has stopped short of taking further action , hampered by deep splits among its members . 
many value their links with oil-rich Nigeria and say trade sanctions would only hurt ordinary people , not the junta . 
but Alice Ukoko , who heads the Democratic Alliance of Women of Nigeria , said ordinary people are already suffering the most . 
&quot; Children are living on the street . 
mothers are living on the bridges . 
men are fleeing the country . 
fear is rampant , &quot; she told Reuters . 
&quot; Without sanctions , there will be no change . 
Britain &apos;s new Labour government , elected in May , has said the world should be prepared to apply new sanctions and has backed Nigeria &apos;s continued suspension from the Commonwealth . 
its Conservative predecessors opposed sanctions and the rights groups said the change in tone was palpable . 
&quot; We were impressed by the chemistry in the room . 
we didn &apos;t notice any fault lines , &quot; said Bolaji Akinyemi of the National Democratic Coalition of Nigeria . 
&quot; I also detected a conviction in that room that things needed to change in Nigeria . 
Tony Lloyd , Britain &apos;s representative at the talks , said the Labour government would not accept a victory by Nigeria &apos;s military ruler General Sani Abacha in next year &apos;s elections unless flaws in the poll process were remedied . 
Lloyd told the Financial Times newspaper that the current process would result in &quot; the transition of General Abacha to President Abacha . 
we cannot accept that . 
earlier this week , Nigeria said CMAG -- which comprises Britain , Canada , New Zealand , South Africa , Zimbabwe , Ghana , Jamaica and Malaysia -- was no longer impartial . 
CMAG winds up its closed-door talks on Friday then meets again in September to agree a stance ahead of October &apos;s summit .
