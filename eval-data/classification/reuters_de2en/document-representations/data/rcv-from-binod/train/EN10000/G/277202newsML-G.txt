U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross briefed President Bill Clinton on Thursday on the status of talks on a Israeli troop withdrawal from Hebron , and the White House said Clinton was &quot; pleased by the progress . 
Ross reported to the president by telephone on the &quot; progress of the work he has undertaken to help move the parties to an agreement on Hebron so that they can move on to the important work that lies beyond , &quot; a White House spokewoman said . 
the top-level U.S. review of the negotiations came amid reports from the Middle East that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat expects a Hebron deal with Israel to be signed on December 30 or 31 . 
Palestinian officials , who declined to be identified , said Arafat announced the dates while briefing Palestinian lawmakers in Ramallah on the Hebron talks . 
Clinton was &quot; pleased by the progress &quot; reported by Ross and gave the envoy &quot; instructions on how to proceed when he returns to the region &quot; over the weekend or early next week , spokeswoman April Mellody told reporters . 
in a related development , a senior U.S. official denied a report by syndicated columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak that Richard Holbrooke might replace Ross as Clinton &apos;s Mideast troubleshooter . 
the official also denied the columnists &apos; claim that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s bid for a meeting with Clinton had been rebuffed , adding the two men were likely to meet early next year .
