Middlesbrough chairman Steve Gibson has warned his wayward Brazilian star Emerson he will not be allowed to leave the club . 
the player will be told to honour his contract when he returns from his latest trip to Brazil , despite his wife &apos;s apparent reluctance to live in England . 
&quot; The club &apos;s position is clear . 
Emerson cannot be allowed to leave , &quot; said Gibson . 
&quot; It would send out the wrong signals right across football if Middlesbrough can be dictated to and bullied . 
we are not prepared to sacrifice our reputation by allowing this to happen . 
&quot; Emerson has brought ill repute to the town with all these alleged comments coming from himself and his wife . 
&quot; To date Emerson has been fined six weeks &apos; salary and we will continue to fine him the maximum amount until he conforms . 
Gibson also criticised agents for their part in unsettling Emerson and laid part of the blame with Spanish giants Barcelona , who have been strongly linked with the Brazilian . 
&quot; We are disappointed by Emerson but we believe he has been badly advised , &quot; he added . 
&quot; There has been a disgraceful manipulation of the player so that somebody can profit from the sale of Emerson to Barcelona . 
&quot; I must add that Barcelona &apos;s conduct in this affair requires investigation . 
&quot; The events of this past month have been carefully orchestrated by Emerson &apos;s agent with a possible remit by Barcelona . 
Emerson is believed to earn about 8,000 pounds per week basic salary which means he has already paid around 50,000 pounds in club fines . 
he signed a four-year contract this year , but has not yet informed the club when he intends to return from Brazil where his wife Andrea is reportedly ill . 
&quot; Emerson is contracted to us until June 2000 . 
we want him to spend the best years of his career with us , hopefully win caps for Brazil as well and possibly play in the next World Cup . 
&quot; So he is staying here . 
if he doesn &apos;t comply he will lose everything and it will cost him his career .
