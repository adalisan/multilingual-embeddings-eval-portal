the prices of U.S. Treasury securities closed sharply lower on Friday as investors &apos; worries about renewed economic growth increased . 
yields on the 30-year bond rose to 6.66 percent at one point in the trading session , the highest since the closing level on July 2 . 
concern about a strong retail sales report next week and a weakening dollar contributed to bearish sentiment . 
the Treasury &apos;s 30-year bond was closing down 1-1 / 2 points to yield 6.64 percent . 
James Glassman , senior economist with Chase Securities Inc , said technicians had been talking about a selloff for a while , but discounted the impact of just retail sales . 
&quot; One report is not going to change your view ( on the overall direction of the economy , &quot; Glassman said . 
inventories were growing at a phenomenal rate as businesses were responding to stronger consumer demand , but he saw that demand slowing in the fall and winter . 
&quot; The dollar is still up 12.5 percent on a trade-weighted basis with out major trading partners , &quot; despite recent weakening , Glassman said . 
&quot; To begin with , we had over optimism in the bond market , assuming economic growth moderating and the Federal Reserve not tightening , &quot; said Sung won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. 
the dollar also had been appreciating , attracting foreign investors to treasuries , &quot; but that optimism has turned on a dime , &quot; Sohn said . 
while most analysts had seen little prospect of the Fed raising interest rates at its August meeting , Sohn said the likelihood of the FOMC voting to further tighten monetary policy was probably now 50-50 . 
treasuries were dragged down on Friday as investors feared a strong retail sales report next Wednesday could drive interest rates higher . 
producer prices and consumer prices also were due next week , but analysts retail sales would be the most watched barometer on what direction the economy was taking . 
&quot; The market &apos;s getting nervous about retail sales . 
we &apos;ll probably see a decent bounce , but the Fed won &apos;t move ( to tighten monetary policy ) until September , &quot; said Tom O &apos;Neil , chief economist at Bank of Montreal . 
o &apos;Neil said there was no fundamental reason for the bond market &apos;s fall off on Friday , though there were some stories of diminishing Japanese buying of U.S. treasuries early in the session . 
meanwhile , the September bond contract broke through support at 113-07 to end at 112-21 . 
&quot; There &apos;s no doubt that worry / caution is creeping back into the market &quot; after weeks of large gains and market optimism , &quot; said O &apos;Neil 
at the short end of the maturity spectrum , three-month bills were one basis point lower at 5.15 percent . 
six-month bills were unchanged at 5.23 percent and year bills were up six basis points higher at 5.29 percent . 
the 10-year issue was 30 / 32 lower at 98-06 to yield 6.37 percent .
