U.S. millfeed prices were mostly steady to higher on Wednesday , bolstered by a continued increase in nearby demand , several dealers said . 
&quot; Feed demand has picked up , people are buying to store up and also the run time for feed mills are being cut , &quot; a Midwest broker said . 
one Minneapolis dealer agreed business has been active . 
there was a lot of demand for next week and buyers appeared to be active ahead of Friday &apos;s USDA crop report , the dealer said . 
another dealer also said forward booking was done by some dairy producers . 
in the Northeast , the demand picture looked mixed . 
&quot; We are seeing some interest in moving feed , &quot; a buffalo dealer said . 
but he said some inventories still needed to be worked off . 
&quot; Some people were looking for feed while others said they were well set for next week , &quot; he said . 
but he noted values were holding fairly well to maybe a shade firmer . 
slightly lower run times at the flour mills were cutting into supplies , he added .
