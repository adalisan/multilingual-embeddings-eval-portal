as Hurricane Fran caved in their homes and chased snakes onto their Porches , media-savvy residents of this North Carolina city jumped to their telephones , becoming reporters of their own disaster . 
the storm whipped through the darkened city of Wilmington with 100 mph ( 160 kmh ) winds and torrential rains , tumbling trees and collapsing roofs . 
but some undaunted victims , eyeing a chance at brief notoriety , jostled to get on the air at local television stations . 
&quot; It &apos;s pretty rough out here . 
the wind blew a tree over on the roof and it knocked the chimney in , so we &apos;ve got bricks coming down the fireplace , &quot; a woman who identifed herself as Beth Howell said on WECT , an NBC affiliate . 
&quot; It &apos;s really wild outside . 
the play-by-play desciptions of Fran &apos;s passage recalled those of four years ago in southern Florida , when Hurricane Andrew tore through the Miami area , leaving more than $ 20 billion in damage in its wake . 
during that storm , which made landfall after 4 a.m. ( 0800 GMT ) , dozens of residents called local stations on their cellular telephones as they cowered in closets and bathrooms while the deadly Category 4 storm tore apart their homes . 
as Fran bore down on Wilmington at nightfall , edgy residents used telephones and television to vent frustrations , report accidents and let kinfolk know they were okay . 
&quot; There &apos;s about three feet of water around us , &quot; Donna Ludlow told WECT from the second floor of a home in Carolina Beach . 
&quot; In case my sister is listening , we &apos;re fine . 
her property is under water . 
for some residents , the storm provided a chance to do some ad-lib news reporting as they took the role of journalists who long before had sought safe shelter as the storm &apos;s winds rose . 
&quot; I &apos;m back here looking out the rear window of the patio . 
&quot; It looks like we &apos;re really getting bombarded . 
&quot; We saw a car go by here -- floating that is , &quot; said another caller who telephoned from Carolina Beach . 
from the mundane to the bizzare , hurricane victims seemed delighted with the chance to tell their stories in real time . 
&quot; There &apos;s probably 15 to 18 snakes out there on my porch , &quot; Jim Johnstone said from Rocky Point .
