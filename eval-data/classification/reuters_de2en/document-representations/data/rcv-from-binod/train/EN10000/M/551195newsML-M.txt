Socgen-Crosby has said the recent upturn in Colombo stocks should continue , but buyers should be selective after the all share index moves past 740 points . 
&quot; We expect the market upturn to continue driven by improved domestic liquidity . 
however , we do not believe that an upturn beyond 740 points is sustainable , &quot; it said in a report received on Wednesday . 
the all share index closed at 727.32 points on Tuesday , rising nearly 20 percent from 606.7 on January 2 this year . 
analysts have said the recent rise was due to market sentiment being buoyed by expectations of better corporate performances in 1997 , a three percent cut in reserve ratios of commercial banks and an agreement between the government and the opposition to work together to end the nation &apos;s ethnic conflict . 
Socgen-Crosby said an upturn beyond 740 points was not sustainable because money liquidity which improved with the cut in reserve ratios may tighten in the second half due to likely increases in government borrowings . 
&quot; Historically , government borrowings have been low in the first half of a year as a bulk of tax revenue flows during this period , &quot; it said . 
Socgen-Crosby also said earnings of banking stocks listed in Colombo could flatten as spreads narrow due to improved liquidity . 
&quot; We expect a more sustainable upturn towards end 1997 when investors focus on robust 1998 earnings growth , &quot; it said .
