a poll published on Tuesday , when Argentine journalists were planning a march to mark one month since the brutal murder of a photographer , showed most Argentines believe his killers are linked with the government . 
in a damning judgment of the Peronist government of President Carlos Menem , the poll in the respected financial daily El Cronista also showed more than 91 percent believe &quot; there are mafias linked with or protected by the government . 
the charred , handcuffed body of the Noticias news magazine photographer Jose Luis Cabezas was found in a car in the beach resort of Pinamar on Jan . 25 . 
the 35-year-old father of three had been tortured , shot in the head , doused with petrol and burnt to a skeleton . 
it was a gruesome reminder of the &quot; death squads &quot; that terrorised Argentina before and during the military rule of 1976 to 1983 . 
huge public protest has been mobilised . 
journalist unions planned a march through Buenos Aires on Tuesday ending with a national minute of silence at 7 p.m. ( 2400 GMT ) , when shops would lower shutters , church bells toll and buses and taxis stop . 
Menem himself was expected to adhere to the silent homage . 
the survey of 737 people in and around Buenos Aires by pollsters Germano &amp; Giacobe last week said 85 percent thought Cabezas &apos; killers &quot; have links with political powers &quot; while 59 percent feared his murder &quot; presages a new wave of political violence &quot; in Argentina . 
police have arrested five suspects but there is no sign yet they are on the trail of whoever ordered the killing . 
one of those arrested , convicted killer and drug dealer Margarita Di Tullio , known as &quot; Pepita la Pistolera &quot; ( Pepita the gun girl ) , told Clarin newspaper from prison : &quot; Cabezas &apos; killing was a horrendous political crime and they wanted a scapegoat with a record like mine , so here I am . 
Noticias , the country &apos;s top-selling weekly news magazine , has made many enemies by uncovering major corruption scandals , including graft in the Buenos Aires provincial police -- which is investigating the death of Cabezas . 
one theory has linked the murder to a power struggle between Menem and his former deputy , Buenos Aires Province Governor Eduardo Duhalde , who is campaigning to become Menem &apos;s successor in the next election in 1999 . 
opposition newspaper Pagina 12 said this weekend there was evidence linking the crime to one of Menem &apos;s own bodyguards . 
the poll in El Cronista showed 51 percent did not find the Menem / Duhalde link credible , while 46 percent did . 
the government has made the Cabezas case top priority and Interior Minister Carlos Corach told reporters Tuesday : &quot; We are absolutely convinced that this crime will be solved .
