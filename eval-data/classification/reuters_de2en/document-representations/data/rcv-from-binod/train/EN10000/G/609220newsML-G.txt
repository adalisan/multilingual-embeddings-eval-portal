two teenagers from affluent Manhattan neighbourhoods were charged Friday for the murder of a man was found floating in a lake in Central Park with his throat slashed . 
police said a 15-year-old boy and his 15-year-old girlfriend , both from comfortable neighbourhoods adjoining the park , had been drinking beer at the lakeside with the 44-year-old man after midnight when there was a dispute involving the girl . 
&quot; At some point , the 15-year-old boy stabbed him multiple times and threw his body in the lake , &quot; New York City Police Commissioner Howard Safir told a news conference . 
he called it &quot; a gruesome , horrible murder . 
the victim had large gashes around the throat , abdomen , face and wrist , Safir said . 
an unspecified amount of money had been taken from his wallet and a knife was recovered that police believed was used in the crime . 
police said the victim lived in Manhattan but declined to identify him until relatives were notified . 
all three knew each other and were known to frequent the park , police said . 
the teens were identified as Christopher Vasquez and Daphne Abdella . 
the girl is from a wealthy family living on Central Park West , the avenue alongside the park that is home to some of New York &apos;s most affluent residents . 
police said Vasquez also lived near the park , on the Upper East Side of Manhattan off Fifth Avenue , another well-off neighbourhood . 
Abdella and Vasquez were both charged with second degree murder and depraved indifference for human life , intentional murder and robbery . 
they were expected to be arraigned Saturday and indicted by a grand jury next week , officials said . 
if convicted they would face 25 years to life in jail . 
the killing was the first in Central Park since the September 1995 murder of Brazilian runner Maria Pinto Moneiro Alves . 
that murder has not been solved . 
officials said police became aware of the killing after three emergency calls -- one from a private citizen , one from the girl &apos;s father reporting the girl was missing and the third from the girl herself .
