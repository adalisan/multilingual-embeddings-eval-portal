although a rate hike by the Federal Reserve was fully priced into the market , U.S. Treasury yield spreads continued to narrow on Tuesday after the Fed raised rates by a quarter-point . 
the yield curve flattened by about two basis points , with the when-issued two-year note rising to 6.33 percent after the hike from 6.29 percent late Monday . 
meanwhile , the 30-year bond yield rose to 6.95 percent from 6.93 percent . 
the 62-basis-point spread is the narrowest since late October , 1995 . 
it took some time for the market to figure out how to respond to the rate hike . 
at first , the market rallied , with bond prices up as much as a half-point . 
but it was short-lived . 
the market &quot; didn &apos;t know which way to go at first , but I think it is quite interesting that in both selloffs and rallies the curve flattened , &quot; said Nanette Abuhoff , senior fixed income strategist at J.P. Morgan &amp; Co Inc . 
Abuhoff forecasts the yield curve continuing to narrow , with the two-to-30-year spread at about 55 basis points by June . 
&quot; We look to 50 basis points as a target , &quot; she said . 
&quot; Now , ( the market is ) playing a timing game . 
does the Fed go again in May , or do they wait until July ? 
if the market believes the Fed will wait until July , the market could rally somewhat until then , analysts said . 
the bond is said to be well supported at around 7.0 percent , while two-year notes look to trade in the 6.30 to 6.50 percent range , players predicted . 
&quot; The front end is clear cut : you don &apos;t want to own this paper , &quot; said Patrick Dimick , U.S. Treasury market strategist at UBS Securities LLC . 
Dimick said that since the Fed indicated strong growth was a major issue , upcoming data such as March non-farm payrolls and the National Association of Purchasing Management index will be closely scrutinized . 
more bond-bearish data and the Fed will raise rates again soon , he said . 
&quot; The text was a strong indication that they are at the beginning of a tightening cycle and not a one-off tightening , &quot; Dimick said . 
meanwhile , the shorter end of the curve steepened true to form , with the spread between the three-month and year-bills widening to 31 basis points from 27 basis points late Monday . 
the three-month bill &apos;s rate rose one basis point to 5.25 percent , while the year-bill jumped five basis points to 5.56 percent . 
players said they anticipated further gains in the year-bill rate , coinciding with an increase in yields in coupons .
