gold prices look like remaining in their $ 321- $ 328 per ounce range on Monday as the market digs in ahead of the over the counter ( OTC ) option expiry on Tuesday . 
some analysts said silver &apos;s prospects might be more positive but resistance at $ 4.40 would have to be taken out first . 
analysts and dealers said the precious metals would be marking time ahead of the option expiry , which would help confine gold &apos;s ambitions . 
producer selling and profit-taking were assisting the resistance at $ 328 / $ 329 , where the market had failed three times recently . 
support was expected at $ 324 initially and then at $ 321 . 
&quot; There is no real trend . 
we are in a fairly narrow range and that is likely to remain in place until after the expiry , &quot; one analyst said . 
above the market , $ 332- $ 333 was the next significant area , which was a 40 percent retracement level . 
however , gold was technically still close to oversold with an RSI of 52 , which might encourage some covering . 
&quot; The action is still with the shorts and they are in no hurry to take their profits . 
the funds hold the key and the investors are staying away , &quot; one analyst said . 
the $ 320 , $ 325 and $ 330 strike prices were the most significant major numbers for the options expiry . 
&quot; There has been a tendancy for the market to turn lower after expiries , &quot; an analyst observed . 
at 0740 GMT gold was indicated at $ 325.25 / $ 325.75 compared with London &apos;s $ 323.80 / $ 324.30 finish on Friday . 
further gains were forecast for silver , where the technical indicators were turning higher . 
a constructive close on Friday of $ 4.31 / $ 4.33 and $ 4.315 , up four cents on the COMEX September contract , suggested the $ 4.40 spot resistance could be challenged later this week when the option expiry was completed . 
&quot; Silver got from $ 4.37 to $ 4.45 for a moment last week but there was no follow through buying , &quot; one analyst said . 
however , he added , &quot; The ( gold / silver ) ratio is getting better for silver . 
the gold / silver ratio was at 75.15 on Friday , off last Tuesday &apos;s high of 76.61 but well above early July levels of around 71 / 72 . 
at 0740 silver was indicated at $ 4.34 / $ 4.36 , up three cents from Friday &apos;s close . 
the market was nervous but quiet on Monday morning with prices barely moving from $ 423.00 / $ 426.00 , just 50 cents up on the Friday close . 
options were also an issue for platinum , which was still tight and in steep backwardation despite the first arrivals of Russia metal in Tokyo last week . 
resistance was likely near the current price , and the July 1 high of $ 437.00 was likely to stop any breakout attempt , analysts said . 
buying would support at $ 410.00 . 
at 0840 platinum was indicated at $ 423.00 / $ 426.00 , just 50 cents above London &apos;s Friday close .
