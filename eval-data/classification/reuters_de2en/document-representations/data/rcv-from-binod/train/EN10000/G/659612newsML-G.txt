jurors weighing the fate of convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh deliberated for the second day on Friday , deciding whether he should be put to death or spend the rest of his life in jail . 
the jury of seven men and five women began deliberations at around 8 : 30 am MDT ( 1530 GMT ) with impassioned pleas from prosecutors to vote for the death penalty and from defence lawyers to spare McVeigh &apos;s life still fresh in their minds . 
at mid-morning , the jury notified lawyers and the judge that it had a question , leading to a brief , closed-door meeting . 
McVeigh &apos;s chief attorney Stephen Jones said afterward the question was &quot; routine &quot; but he did not provide details . 
the Gulf War veteran was found guilty on June 2 of murder and conspiracy charges for the April 19 , 1995 , bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building , which killed 168 people . 
his parents and sister were in the courtroom on Thursday when Jones told the jury that if they spare McVeigh &apos;s life he may someday tell the whole story of the bombing . 
&quot; Dead men don &apos;t tell tales , &quot; Jones told the jury . 
&quot; The government may not be the only people who want my client executed , &quot; he said , implying there could be others involved who would be glad to see McVeigh take his secret to the grave . 
but prosecutors argued that the 29-year old McVeigh was a coward and a traitor and the jury should not be afraid to vote for the death penalty . 
Marsha Kight , whose 23-year-old daughter Frankie Merrell died in the bombing , said waiting to hear McVeigh punishment was less stressful than waiting for the guilty verdict . 
&quot; What was important for me was to see him convicted . 
I still have an interest in this , but the big wait is over , &quot; Kight said . 
she expressed empathy for McVeigh &apos;s father , Bill , saying the wait for him reminded her of what she went through waiting for word about her daughter after the bombing . 
Kight has said she does not believe McVeigh should be put to death . 
there are only 13 people on death row in the United States for federal crimes , compared with about 3,200 who have been sentenced to die by 34 state courts . 
death penalty opponents planned a march on Friday across the street from the Denver federal Courthouse to protest the use of capital punishment . 
unlike when it reached its guilty verdict , the jury has not been sequestered during its penalty deliberations . 
lawyers for McVeigh &apos;s alleged co-conspirator Terry Nichols asked the judge to caution the McVeigh jurors about any remarks they may make about Nichols , whose trial will begin later this year . 
&quot; McVeigh jurors will likely be asked by the press to speculate about Mr. Nichols alleged involvement and the probably outcome in his upcoming trial , &quot; Nichols &apos; attorneys wrote in their motion filed with the court . 
when the trial is finished the jurors will be free to speak and Nichols &apos; attorneys said they would not presume to ask for an order directing jurors not to speak about Nichols . 
but they asked the judge to read a short statement cautioning them that any remarks about Nichols &quot; could have the effect of making it more difficult for Mr. Nichols to select an impartial jury or obtain a fair trial .
