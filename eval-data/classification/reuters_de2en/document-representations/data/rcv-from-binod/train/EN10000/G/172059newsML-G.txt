top seed Monica Seles made quick work of her first match at the Bank of the West classic Wednesday , beating Patricia Hy-Boulais of Canada 6-1 6-2 in just 60 minutes . 
also winning second-round matches were second seed Lindsay Davenport , fifth seed Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands , Kim Po and Linda Wild . 
Seles , a two-time winner here , dominated from the start , slicing forehands to the corners . 
she will next face Po in the quarter-finals . 
Seles came into the match after a semifinal loss to Jennifer Capriati in Chicago on Saturday . 
that defeat dropped her to a co-number two world ranking with Arantxa Sanchez Vicario . 
she had been ranked co-number one with Steffi Graf since her return to the tour last year . 
&quot; After this year is over , I just want to do better at the Grand slams , &quot; Seles said . 
&quot; Not so much the rankings . 
being number one is definitely not a priority in my life any more . 
it &apos;s a bonus . 
despite a sour stomach , Seles looked sharp throughout the match , smacking winners from both sides and keeping Hy-Boulais off-balance from the baseline . 
my stomach is still not feeling that well yet . 
Seles &apos;s ailing shoulder , which she said might require surgery someday , held up well . 
&quot; It feels better every day , &quot; Seles said . 
that translated into a high efficiency on first serve , 64 percent . 
&quot; She was able to come up with big serves , &quot; Hy-Boulais said . 
Monica plays a different game than the rest of the pack . 
she stays right on top of the baseline and makes you alter a lot of shots . 
Seles , who beat Martina Navratilova in both of her previous wins here in 1990 and 1992 , could meet the other Martina in Sunday &apos;s final . 
Swiss teen sensation Martina Hingis returns to action against Wild in Thursday &apos;s quarter-final . 
Seles has only one seed , fourth seed Mary Joe Fernandez , in her half of the draw . 
Hingis has Schultz-McCarthy and Davenport in her side .
