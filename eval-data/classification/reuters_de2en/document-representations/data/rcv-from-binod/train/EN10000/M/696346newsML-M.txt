dollar / mark , having drawn strength from doubts about the European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) , is heading for a test of 1.7530 resistance and a fresh 40-month high , analysts said . 
dollar / mark surged to 1.7465 on Monday , its highest since the week ended on February 20 , 1994 . 
&quot; The whole EMU concern helped dollar / mark pop up to new highs , but it has been running into good selling interest at the top , &quot; said David Solin , a partner at Foreign Exchange Analystics . 
&quot; It &apos;s topping out . 
but it &apos;s possible , feasible to see 1.7530 in another attempt at the top side . 
Chartist Ben Morden at I.D.E.A. 
said the intermediate resistance for dollar / mark is 1.7465 , the retest of the high on Monday , followed by a major hurdle in the 1.7520 / 30 area . 
the 1.7520 level is where the upper end of a rising channel from April comes in , while 1.7530 was the next high in 1994 -- also set in the week ended on February 20 . 
dollar / mark had established a 1994 peak a few days earlier , on February 8 , at 1.7686 -- likely a tough level to take out , analysts said . 
&quot; closing today above 1.7423 , the prior 1994 high set on June 6 , would be very constructive , &quot; Morden predicted . 
at 1930 GMT , the dollar was quoted at 1.7450 / 55 versus 1.7438 / 43 at the open and at 114.62 / 67 vs. 114.33 / 43 . 
Morden said dollar / yen , still lackluster , was continuing to somewhat decouple from dollar / mark . 
&quot; Some more mark / yen buying would help dollar / yen . 
there is strong support at 65.50 / 55 , for a run at 65.80 to 66.10 , &quot; Morden said as mark / yen changed hands at 65.68 / 70 . 
foreign Exchange analytics &apos;s Solin expected dollar / yen to improve in the more quiet environment that followed the post-G7 summit tension highlighted by a call by Japan &apos;s Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto for foreign exchange cooperation . 
&quot; Dollar / yen can probably go higher , as high as 117.00 , &quot; Solin said , referring to the 38-percent retracement of the fall from 127.47 , the May 1 high , to 110.62 , the June 11 low . 
Solin noted 117.00 yen also is the recent high on May 28 . 
&quot; The market is starting to sense dollar / yen is more stable , &quot; said Solin who agreed with Morden mark / yen may &quot; go higher , &quot; maybe to 68.00 and help dollar / yen in the process . 
however , before attacking 117.00 , dollar / yen must convincingly take out a falling resistance trendline that is coming at 115.55 / 60 , chartists said .
