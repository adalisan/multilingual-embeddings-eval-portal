South African President Nelson Mandela said on Thursday that the country &apos;s weak rand currency was a source of great concern , but his cabinet ministers were addressing the issue . 
&quot; The depreciation of the rand is a source of great concern , &quot; Mandela said in an address to businessmen . 
he said numerous reasons had been given for the fall , including that the rand was overvalued and the dollar had strengthened against a whole basket of currencies . 
he said the International Monetary Fund offered South Africa funds to build foreign reserves , but that his deputy Thabo Mbeki , Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and Trade Minister Alec Erwin , had said there was no reason to hurry . 
&quot; They said &apos; Let &apos;s not hurry . 
we are addressing the situation . 
Mandela described Manuel as a conscientious and methodical person . 
the rand has lost some 30 percent of its value against the dollar this year and was probing levels around 4.6850 to the U.S. unit at Wednesday &apos;s close . 
it has recovered some ground this week from its worst ever level of 4.77 , which it hit two weeks ago . 
but dealers said the currency remained vulnerable to further speculative attacks given the country &apos;s low reserves .
