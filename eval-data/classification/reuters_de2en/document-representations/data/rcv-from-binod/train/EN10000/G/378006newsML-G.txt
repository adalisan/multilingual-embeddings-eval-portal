leaders of an exiled nationalist Uighur group in Kazakhstan said on Friday that riots in China &apos;s predominantly Moslem north-west were continuing despite Beijing &apos;s statement that disturbances had been quelled . 
&quot; We are sure , and there are facts proving this , that it is too early for Beijing to announce that the riots have been neutralised , &quot; Yusupbek Mukhlisi , leader of the United National Front of Turkestan , told a news conference . 
&quot; The riots go on in several areas of the province of Xinjiang where people have taken up arms to defend themselves , but Beijing has managed to create an information vacuum around the event , &quot; Mukhlisi said in the Kazakh capital Almaty . 
Chinese officials said on Thursday the riot in the town of Yining , 50 km ( 30 miles ) from the border with Kazakhstan , that started last week , had been &quot; fomented by hostile foreign forces &quot; but had finally been quelled by the army and police . 
Chinese officials have said nine people were killed and at least 198 wounded , including about 50 of them seriously . 
but Mukhlisi said that the real death toll in Yining was betweeen 80 and 90 between February 5 and 10 alone . 
Beijing says the riot had erupted after an Uighur criminal suspect resisted arrest by police . 
officials said that about 1,000 people , mostly Uighur farmers and unemployed youths , rampaged through Yining , smashing and burning cars , looting shops and demanding China &apos;s pullout from the province . 
but Mukhlisi said the riot had been triggered by &quot; Beijing &apos;s colonial policy , genocide , mass influx of ethnic Han Chinese to the province and social-economic problems of the Uighurs &quot; . 
Turkic-speaking Uighurs are in the majority in Xinjiang , where ethnic Han Chinese make up 38 percent of the population . 
Mukhlisi said last week &apos;s execution of 30 Uighur nationalists was the last straw . 
&quot; The knife has finally cut the bone , &quot; he said . 
Mukhlisi said that since April 1996 some 57,000 Uighur separatists had been arrested and about 1,700 of them executed . 
last week &apos;s riot was one of the largest , most violent demonstrations for independence in the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang -- which means New Frontier in Chinese -- since the 1949 communist takeover . 
another Uighur leader , Kakhriman Kozhamberdi , said : &quot; The recent riot and reprisals against Chinese Moslems regretfully , drew no reaction from heads of the Central Asian region . 
leaders of ex-Soviet republics bordering China have kept a diplomatic silence during the latest disturbances .
