Bosnian Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic will meet President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia in Paris in about three weeks time , U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke said on Sunday . 
the announcement in Sarajevo follows a day after Bosnia &apos;s Serbs , Moslems and Croats voted in elections to help reunify the country under terms of the 1995 Dayton peace treaty engineered by Holbrooke . 
Holbrooke brokered the Izetbegovic-Milosevic meeting after separate talks with both men in Sarajevo and Belgrade after a U.S. delegation tour of polling stations during Bosnia &apos;s first post-war elections . 
speaking after seeing Izetbegovic on his return from a four-hour visit to Belgrade , the American peace architect said the Paris meeting hinged on a resolution of Moslem-Serb disputes over the conduct of the elections . 
he was confident the meeting would go ahead . 
&quot; We said were going to launch an intense diplomatic effort ( after the elections ) . 
this ( Paris meeting ) is the first manifestation of that effort , &quot; Holbrooke told reporters . 
Muhamed Sacirbey , Bosnian ambassador to the United Nations who was with Holbrooke , thanked Holbrooke for his latest round of Balkans diplomacy .
