U.S. refiners were cleaning up foreign crudes for September delivery on Monday , spurring early talk of October barrels , traders said . 
North Sea Brent crude softened over the course of the day in response to the drop in dated values in Europe . 
earlier notional quotes of October West Texas Intermediate / Cushing parity to October WTI minus 15 cents a barrel drifted down to October WTI minus 25 cents for September delivery later in the day , traders said . 
still , firm offers remained scarce amid continued availability of comparable regional and domestic grades . 
two cargoes of Cusiana crude , for example , were still looking for buyers despite news that two-thirds of the September program would be delayed by two to five days . 
the delays were attributed to operational tie-ups as the field ramps up production . 
of the two remaining shipments , BP &apos;s cargo originally scheduled to load September 19-23 was shifted back to September 24-25 , while Total &apos;s September 23-27 was pushed to September 28-29 . 
Colombian state Ecopetrol &apos;s September 25-29 cargo apparently was nixed from the program altogether . 
of the original September program of 15 cargoes , 12 were signed , all with U.S. refiners . 
despite the delays , the three companies that market Cusiana , Ecopetrol , BP and Total , were not expected to declare force majeure on the affected cargoes . 
sellers were asking 85-90 cents under November WTI , partly reflecting the absence of competing North Sea barrels in the Gulf , traders said . 
several Cusiana deals were done last week at $ 1.05-1.10 under October WTI . 
elsewhere in Latin America , a trading house was offering Argentine Santa Cruz for October 20-30 arrival , asking December WTI plus 15 cents on a delivered basis . 
on the West African front , another trading house was heard to have sold a VLCC of Nigerian qua Iboe to an East Coast refiner for September 5-10 arrival at an undisclosed price . 
traders said one of the cargoes may already have been sold to a Gulf refiner , prompting speculation that the seller would need to find more qua Iboe to cover the earlier commitment . 
in a separate deal , a U.S. Gulf refiner , looking to cover for the Cusiana delays , was heard to have picked up a qua Iboe cargo from a U.S. company at around 25 cents over October WTI for September 15-20 delivery , traders said .
