Italy said on Wednesday it was time for Serbia &apos;s government and opposition to open a dialogue aimed at improving democracy after Belgrade &apos;s parliament reinstated annulled opposition victories . 
a Foreign Ministry statement said Italy welcomed Tuesday &apos;s passage of a special law by the Socialist-dominated parliament reinstating annulled victories in 14 cities in November polls . 
the statement said Italy was now awaiting &quot; the start of a constructive dialogue between the government and opposition for the democratisation of the political system in Serbia &quot; . 
the passage of the special law came after three months of daily protests and widespread international condemnation of the Serbian government for annulling the local elections .
