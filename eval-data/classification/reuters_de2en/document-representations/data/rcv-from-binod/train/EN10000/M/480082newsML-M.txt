Austrian shares took a battering on Tuesday , falling 2.6 percent in reaction to an overnight sell-off on Wall Street , traders said . 
it was the worst setback the index has had since October 1995 when Austrian shares slumped 2.86 percent after the collapse of the government coalition . 
traders see next support at 1,180 points . 
&quot; It &apos;s held well at that level , &quot; said one , noting a technical rebound was possible since Wall Street could close higher . 
one or two days of gains could be in the offing but uncertainty over U.S. interest rates remained , one trader said . 
&quot; The uncertainty will continue on that front , &quot; he said , speculating the index could drop as low as 1,164 points . 
among its constituents 17 fell , two rose and two remained unchanged . 
luxury hosiery maker Wolford led the decliners for second straight trading day , falling 8.7 percent to 1,205 schillings . 
the leading gainer was Creditanstalt ordinaries , climbing 0.21 percent to 717.5 schillings . 
shares in Austrian beverage group BBAG ended unchanged at 743 schillings , after the company said its majority shareholders had rejected a takeover bid by drinks giant South African breweries ( SAB ) . 
the April ATX future tumbled 43.0 points to 1,177.0 on heavy volume of 1,966 contracts .
