declaring &quot; the war is over &quot; , Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed said he and rebel military leader Aslan Maskhadov agreed to shelve the issue of Chechnya &apos;s independence-demand for five years . 
after overnight talks they decided to defer until December 31 , 2001 a decision whether Chechnya should be independent of Russian rule . 
Lebed and Maskhadov , after eight hours of talks in this small settlement just outside Chechnya &apos;s eastern borders , signed a joint statement and a package of basic principles on further peace talks between Moscow and the rebels . 
&quot; That &apos;s it , the war is over , &quot; Lebed told reporters who witnessed the signing . 
a three-page document signed by the two negotiators amid shouts of joy from dozens of people crowded inside the conference room and hundreds of others gathered outside , included two basic points . 
the first provided that &quot; an agreement on the basic principles of relations between the Russian Federation and the Chechen Republic , based on international law , should be reached by December 31 , 2001 &quot; . 
the second said that by October 1 , 1996 the sides should form a joint commission to monitor a complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya and coordinate steps in fighting crime and terrorism in the region . 
the commission is also authorised to work out proposals on financial relations between Russia and Chechnya as well as a programme for the social and economic recovery of the region . 
&quot; The legislation of the Chechen Republic should be based on respect for human rights , the right of national self-determination , the free expression of will by citizens , civil peace , ethnic harmony and safety for all residents , &quot; the document said . 
Lebed said the five-year deferral in deciding Chechnya &apos;s status , the most painful issue of the war launched when Moscow sent troops in December 1994 to quell the region &apos;s independence bid , was essential . 
&quot; Then , with cool heads , calmly and soberly we will sort out our relations , &quot; Lebed said . 
tens of thousands of people have died in the 20-month war , in which Russia failed to win control over the whole of Chechnya and its troops suffered several humiliating defeats . 
President Boris Yeltsin ordered Lebed to restore peace in Chechnya and gave him unspecified sweeping powers to carry out the mission . 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Friday that Yeltsin backed a package of proposals Lebed took to the talks .
