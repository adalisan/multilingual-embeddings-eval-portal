the following are initial views from economists on Friday after June quarter retail sales data . 
the data showed seasonally adjusted sales rising 1.6 percent quarter on quarter , and 2.0 percent in real terms . 
Seasonally adjusted sales rose 0.2 percent in the June month . 
economists had forecast a rise of 1.28 percent seasonally adjusted in the June quarter and a 0.17 percent fall in the June month . 
&quot; It was a pretty good deflator number . 
it tends to confirm the view that a lot of that first quarter data , the GDP and the retail sales , is very misleading , due to the seasonal problems with the timing of Easter . 
&quot; So it &apos;s very much confirming our view of the economy -- no it wasn &apos;t imploding , it has been bouncing along the bottom of the cycle , and the best indication of what &apos;s been happening in the economy is to actually average those first two quarters of data . 
&quot; It will tend to confirm for the Reserve Bank that their previous forecasts for the real activity weren &apos;t too far off the mark . 
Roberts said some rebound was expected because retail sales had been so weak for so long . 
sales had been negative in real terms for the previous four quarters . 
&quot; Otherwise it would suggest that New Zealand was genuinely in recession . 
this rebound though is not expected to persist because over the course of the last few months we have seen the impact of monetary conditions feeding through into variable rate mortgages in New Zealand . 
&quot; We are still looking for fairly soft economic activity in New Zealand over the course of the next couple of quarters and the net result of that is the RBNZ will still be in a position to ease monetary conditions when it brings down its economic forecasts on September 18 . 
he said the market had been easing conditions ahead of the RBNZ &apos;s forecasts and the bank was likely to ratify that easing . 
the recent rise in mortgage interest rates would depress consumer spending , highlighting problems the RBNZ &apos;s management of monetary conditions via its Monetary Conditions Index . 
&quot; I feel that part of the problem with the Monetary Conditions Index is that at this weaker stage of the economic cycle it has too much of an automatic reaction in terms of short term interest rates moving up when the currency comes under downward pressure . 
Roberts said the net result was that domestic demand was likely to remain very restrained . 
there was likely to be further softness in the New Zealand dollar as the RBNZ eased monetary conditions further , although it was getting somewhere close to the bottom around US $ 0.6350 . 
&quot; I think it suggests that the first half was pretty flat overall and we &apos;re not saying these are the green shoots of recovery by any stretch , because I think the economy will be pretty sluggish through the rest of this year until they ( the RBNZ ) ease some more . 
&quot; It was a bit stronger than we were expecting but it just confirmed that the quarterly track for the first half the year is rubbish . 
that March quarter was way too weak and June quarter was way too strong . 
in reality , activity was just above zero for the two quarters in total . 
&quot; It suppose it does show that the retailing sector , in volume terms , did a bit better in the first half of this year than it did in the second half of last year . 
&quot; But I wouldn &apos;t say that the June number shows that we are necessarily booming . 
&quot; That &apos;s really the message to take from it -- the Reserve Bank view of room for a slight further easing is probably justified , but this result casts doubt as to whether things are getting so weak that we would need to ease significantly .
