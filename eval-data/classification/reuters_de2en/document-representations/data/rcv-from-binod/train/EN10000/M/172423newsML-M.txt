Hungarian share prices closed mixed on the Budapest Stock Exchange on Thursday while investors awaited more third quarter results , traders said . 
&quot; The picture was mixed because investors waited for more third-quarter results and the dollar weakened somewhat , &quot; said Peter Tolgyesi of Buda-Cash Brokerhaz . 
&quot; These factors offset each other . 
some recent gainers nevertheless continued to rise to new all-time highs before closing at lower levels . 
&quot; The index advanced modestly thanks to Danubius , Borsodchem and Graboplast , &quot; Tolgyesi said . 
on Thursday pharmaceuticals maker Richter , home improvement product maker Graboplast and Inter-Europa Bank released their interim results . 
Graboplast soared to a new all-time high of 5,050 forints , joining hotel firm Danubius and chemical firm Borsodchem which extended their earlier gains once again to new highs . 
Graboplast closed at 5,050 forints , up 200 . 
Borsodchem peaked at 3,420 forints before retreating to close unchanged at 3,395 forints . 
Danubius surged to 3,500 forints and closed at 3,450 forints , up 120 . 
shareholders of Richter also reacted positively to the company &apos;s results but the size of the daily price rise was far not that high as in earlier quarters when the share &apos;s price firmed hundreds of forints after the results . 
Richter closed at 8,380 forints , up 10 , but below the day &apos;s peak of 8,495 . 
&quot; It closed some disappointment to investors that Richter &apos;s quite good results did not push its price as it was expected and as it happens usually , &quot; Tolgyesi said . 
&quot; Investors might conclude that expectations towards three-quarter results are already built into prices , &quot; he said . 
&quot; This may foreshadow that no major price increase can be expected . 
Inter-Europa Bank closed at 38,500 forints , down 300 .
