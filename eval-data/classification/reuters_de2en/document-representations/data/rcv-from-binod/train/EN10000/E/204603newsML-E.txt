British retail sales rose by 0.4 percent in October compared with a fall of 0.3 percent the previous month , the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday . 
retail sales rose by an annual rate of 4.1 percent in October against a 3.6 percent rise the previous month . 
the figures were broadly in line with market forecasts . 
the Treasury said the rise in retail sales showed increased confidence among British consumers . 
&quot; Rising high street sales show that people have the cash to spend and the confidence to do it , &quot; Economic Secretary to the Treasury Angela Knight said . 
government bonds , which had fallen overnight , rose slightly on the retail sales news , but leading shares generally eased . 
Britain raised interest rates three weeks ago in an attempt to head off risks of a rise in inflation .
