CBOT soft red winter wheat futures closed lower during a roller coaster finale but bearish impetus from weather ruled along with talk of a trade estimate for freeze losses in hard red winter wheat below some expectations , traders said . 
traders said a Midwest-based firm pegged the losses in the Plains hard red winter wheat crop during the April 12-13 freeze below some previous estimates . 
there also have been estimates that up to 290 million bushels were lost . 
new crop July wheat swung in a 15-cent-per-bushel range and was trading higher in late dealings on European action . 
the EU slapped a tax on daily exports of soft wheat to conserve domestic supplies . 
but the wheat market a week ago touched up the 20 cent trading limit on expectations for a halt in EU wheat exports as the EU then closed for the season its weekly wheat tenders . 
some traders said the late but short-lived rally in wheat futures was tied to commercial buying with Cargill Inc keying the gains by purchasing four million bushels of July . 
wheat closed unchanged to 11-1 / 4 cents per bushel lower , with May down 10-3 / 4 at $ 4.21-1 / 2 . 
July was down 10 at $ 4.25-3 / 4 . 
&quot; That &apos;s what turned wheat around ( the Cargill buying ) but it &apos;s more psychological support , &quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter . 
&quot; It &apos;s like beating a dead horse . 
they said weeks ago they weren &apos;t going to export wheat . 
the market took note of improved export prospects with U.S. exporters citing the potential for Pakistan to be in the market for more wheat this weekend than had initially been expected . 
the exporters said Pakistan may tender for 315,000 to 600,000 tonnes of optional origin wheat as opposed to the 200,000 to 300,000 originally expected . 
but USDA &apos;s weekly export sales report for last week was neutral to bearish to wheat futures . 
USDA early Thursday said U.S. net export sales of wheat in the week ended April 17 totaled 192,400 tonnes , in the middle of expectations for 150,000 to 250,000 tonnes . 
weather forecasts in the U.S. and abroad remained the focal point in CBOT wheat futures trading . 
&quot; It &apos;s cool and wet which will encourage new tiller growth , &quot; a trader said . 
wheat tillers are central to the formation of wheat heads and resultant berries . 
prospects for cool and damp weather in the U.S. Great Plains was seen aiding the recovery of the crop which was hit by a freeze the weekend of Apri 12-13 , traders said . 
but concerns remain about the fate of the crop . 
meteorologists said several inches of rain and possible flash flooding were forecast for much of Oklahoma and northern Texas Thursday through Saturday . 
the abundant rain could harm maturing wheat in those areas . 
however , only a small amount of rain was forecast for the dry fields in northern Kansas and Nebraska , not enough to aid the the wheat there , they said . 
prospects for spring wheat seedings to gain speed soon also were bearish for wheat futures prices . 
spring wheat plantings in North Dakota likely will be delayed in the northeast and Red River Valley counties because of flooding but elsewhere , prospects appear favorable , a crop expert said . 
there also were outlooks for rain in France but the rainfall amounts expected may not help the crop much . 
London trade sources Thursday said forecasts for rain in western Europe will be welcomed by farmers but it needs to be sustained to benefit crop growth . 
Cargill Inc bought four million bushels of July , Goldenberg Hehmeyer bought two million July , Refco Inc sold three million July , E.D. 
and F. Man International sold one million July as did FIMAT futures , traders said . 
wheat futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 30,000 contracts , above the 21,755 traded Wednesday . 
in wheat options , Goldenberg Hehmeyer sold 1,000 July $ 5.00 calls and sold 1,000 July $ 4.00 puts at 17 cents . 
wheat options volume was estimated at 15,000 contracts , about the same as the 14,925 traded Wednesday .
