Indonesia has been shaken by some of the worst election campaign violence seen during President Suharto &apos;s 30-year rule and nerves are on edge as the nation prepares to vote in national and local elections this week . 
the violence reached a peak with the deaths of at least 134 people in the South Kalimantan provincial capital of Banjarmasin , most of them in a blazing shopping complex during a riot on the final day of campaigning on Friday . 
much of the violence during the campaign was confined to Java island , home to 60 percent of the nation &apos;s 200 million people . 
the confrontations were primarily between supporters of the ruling Golkar and the Moslem-oriented United Development Party ( PPP ) , which has spearheaded criticism of corruption and collusion in the government . 
but financial markets remained relatively stable during the final week of the campaign despite violence in Jakarta itself . 
&quot; I think the impact on the market will not be significant because violence in the run-up to the election has been factored in , &quot; Pardi Kendy , treasury head of PT Bank Buana Indonesia , told Reuters on Sunday . 
&quot; Operators would be more scared if it ( the Banjarmasin riot ) had happened in Jakarta . 
we see the market here on Friday was relatively stable despite the widespread violence , &quot; he said . 
independent political commentator Arief Budiman said the street demonstrations that drew hundreds of thousands of PPP supporters in Jakarta and Central Java were a vehicle for the poor to show they could not be ignored . 
&quot; In Indonesia , people don &apos;t believe in the justice system . 
for the poor people , it is an opportunity to show the government they have power . 
people are frustrated by poverty and unemployment , &quot; he said . 
residents in Banjarmasin attributed the violence there to a dangerous mix of envy and political tensions . 
social and economic tensions have led to intermittent violence in other parts of the country over the past year . 
but analysts noted that by comparison with unrest with other Asian countries , the election violence was contained : there were no reported instances of political partisans using guns on each other , for example . 
&quot; The level of violence is quite different from campaigns in , for example , the Philippines , India or Pakistan , &quot; Dewi Fortuna Anwar of the Centre for Information and Development Studies ( CIDES ) told Reuters . 
political analysts said there had also been a lack of substance in the 27-day campaign , which gave way to a five-day cooling off period from Saturday . 
the only party legally entitled to contest the poll , other than Golkar and the PPP , is the Christian-Nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party ( PDI ) , which was badly split by a leadership struggle last year and was virtually sidelined through the campaign . 
Anwar said because the government restricted political activity to a month every five years for elections to the House of Representatives , people saw it as the only period in which they could make their political feelings openly known . 
&quot; We really can &apos;t blame the people because they really haven &apos;t had much political experience . 
it is a reflection of our state of political maturity , &quot; she said . 
Golkar , undefeated under Suharto , says it is aiming for just over 70 percent backing from the 125 million eligible voters , compared to the 68 percent it won in the last poll in 1992 . 
some analysts have expressed apprehension that if the Golkar vote is too large , PPP supporters may not accept the election outcome and fresh violence could occur . 
the PPP hopes to push its share of the vote over the 17 percent it got in 1992 , possibly at the expense of the PDI which had 15 percent in the last election . 
the poll for the 425 elected seats in the House of Representatives -- the other 75 go to the military which does not vote -- is also a preliminary to a presidential vote in March next year when Suharto , 75 , is widely expected to run for a seventh five-year term . 
one of the key issues is whom he will select as his running mate . 
that person , given Suharto &apos;s age , could become his successor .
