claims that humans have walked Australia for well over 100,000 years drew unexpected support on Tuesday when a scientist said he had separately dated human occupation of the continent to as far back as 200,000 years . 
three days after Australian researchers claimed they had found stone artefacts dating back 116,000 to 176,000 years in a discovery they said could rewrite prehistory , a Melbourne scientist said his own research seemed to confirm the findings . 
&quot; It confirms their work ... , &quot; said Sander van der Kaars , a research fellow at Monash University , referring to the four-member research team which unearthed the stone artefacts in the country &apos;s arid and remote northwest . 
&quot; With all the limitations of accuracy and dating , it &apos;s more likely that you are talking about the same period , &quot; he added . 
van der Kaars , who dated ancient charcoal sediment he believed was left by man-made fire , revealed his findings as members of the Australian scientific community expressed doubt about such an early arrival of humans in Australia . 
the stone artefacts , found beneath an ancient rock art site dubbed &quot; Australia &apos;s Stonehenge &quot; , and the charcoal imply that humans had arrived here by sea over 60,000 years earlier than thought , the two groups of researchers say . 
the two research projects also could support suggestions that modern humans originated in Asia , nor Africa , because the new dates for human occupation of Australia roughly coincide with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa , they said . 
&quot; Because they ( the artefacts and charcoal ) were dated using two different techniques , they should strengthen the evidence in the eyes of the archaeological world , &quot; van der Kaars told Reuters . 
van der Kaars said he had taken the charcoal sediment from a 11-year-old sea-bed core extracted in Indonesian waters southeast of the resort island of Bali , off northwest Australia , as part of studies into climate change . 
the charcoal was swept off the continent and settled on the sea floor along with Australian pollen about 200,000 years ago , he said . 
the charcoal was likely to have come from man-made fires because of the warm , humid climate at the time , he added . 
&quot; It does suggest human impact rather than natural change , &quot; he said . 
&quot; In itself it &apos;s not conclusive evidence ... but it has opened a number of questions and a lot of additional research is needed , &quot; he added . 
van der Kaars said he used a dating technique known as oxygen isotope stratigraphy with a margin of error of around 7,000 years . 
the thermoluminescence technique used to date the stone artefacts had an error margin of 2,000 to 10,000 years , he said . 
the dating of the stone artefacts came under fire on Tuesday from scientists who doubt its accuracy . 
the Australian newspaper quoted archaeologist Mike Morwood , appointed to comment on research done at the rock art site , as saying evidence for the claimed antiquity of the stone artefacts was &quot; extremely tenuous &quot; .
