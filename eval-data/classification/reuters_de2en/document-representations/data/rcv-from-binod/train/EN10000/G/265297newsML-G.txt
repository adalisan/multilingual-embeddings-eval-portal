NATO defence ministers want a new international police force in Bosnia to capture indicted war criminals but are divided over how to tackle the problem , U.S. and NATO officials said on Wednesday . 
&quot; There is broad agreement in principle to do this , &quot; a senior U.S. defence official said after Defence Secretary William Perry met French Defence Minister Charles Millon and then the defence ministers of the Netherlands , Norway and Denmark on Wednesday morning . 
but the official added : &quot; There isn &apos;t yet a specific plan on how to march forward . 
the U.S. official , who asked not to be identified , told reporters a police force could operate either directly under the U.N. criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia , which is based in the Hague , or under the auspices of the European Union or the Organisation on Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 
&quot; What the defence ministers are looking for now is what you would call it , who would run it , how it would be organised , who would contribute to it , &quot; the official added on the second day of a two-day meeting of NATO defence ministers in Brussels . 
NATO officials cautioned privately that no firm agreement on a police force had been reached , saying all alliance countries were worried about possible retaliation against their troops in Bosnia as well as civilian aid workers . 
former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his former military chief Ratko Mladic -- among those indicted by The Hague tribunal -- enjoy huge popularity among fellow Bosnian Serbs . 
NATO fears angry crowds would take to the streets if they were arrested . 
&quot; The danger is that the Bosnian Serbs , Moslems or Croats would seize hostages or take other retaliatory action against any westerner they find , &quot; one NATO official told Reuters . 
but Carl Bildt , the international community &apos;s representative in charge of overseeing civilian reconstruction in Bosnia , has warned that failure to tackle the war crimes issue would prevent any real reconciliation in that country . 
&quot; Refugees will not return and municipal elections are unlikely to be free and fair while these guys ( accused war criminals ) are still out there , &quot; another NATO official conceded privately on Wednesday . 
the U.S. official stressed that the ministers agreed that a new 30,000-member military stabilisation force ( SFOR ) being sent to Bosnia for 18 months to replace the current peacekeeping force there should not be given the task of arresting indicted war criminals . 
but SFOR could coordinate closely with the police force , he said . 
the official said there was deep concern that only seven out of about 80 suspected war criminals had been captured in the past year and there was broad agreement that those indicted should be captured and tried under the Dayton peace accords . 
the official said Millon and Perry met for about 35 minutes and also discussed but reached no agreement on a rift between Washington and Paris over U.S. refusal to bow to a French demand that the United States turn over command of NATO forces in southern Europe to a European officer . 
the job is traditionally held by an American officer and the United States says it should remain that way because the preponderance of allied forces in the region , uncluding the U.S. Sixth Fleet , are American . 
but the official said there was agreement by both Millon and at the subsequent Perry meeting with the ministers of the Netherlands , Norway and Denmark that an enhanced police force was the way to go after indicted war criminals . 
&quot; The French said that they already had 100 gendarmes in the area . 
they did not say that they would increase them , but the implication was that they might , &quot; he told reporters . 
&quot; In the meeting with the Dutch , the Norwegian and the Danish defence ministers there was agreement on the part of the Europeans that this police force should not be under the U.N. 
it should be under either the European Union or the OSCE , that it should be primarily a European responsibility , &quot; he added .
