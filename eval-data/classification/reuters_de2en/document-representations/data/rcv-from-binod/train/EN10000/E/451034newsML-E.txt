Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) chairman Hans Meyer said the central bank planned to keep monetary policy generous for the foreseeable future and played down fears the policy could be fuelling inflation . 
&quot; The expansive monetary policy which we are now maintaining and which we intend to pursue for the foreseeable future is encouraging recovery to the extent that it promotes a decline in interest rates -- thus that of the Swiss franc , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We note with satisfaction development in long-term interest rates and the franc &apos;s exchange rate in past months , &quot; he added in the text of a speech to the Geneva chamber of commerce and industry . 
in addition , he dismissed criticism that the central bank was being too expansive and thus letting inflationary pressure build . 
&quot; In the eyes of some observers , the current course of monetary policy appears exaggeratedly expansive and as a consequence threatens future price stability . 
I do not share this opinion , and this is for two reasons , &quot; Meyer said . 
the first reason , he said , was tied to interpretation of the growth in the SNB &apos;s monetary aggregates , and the second was the Swiss economy , which is only expected to show signs of improving towards the end of this year . 
he said that a particularly strong rise in the central bank money supply has been due partly to a strong rise in notes in circulation which has been difficult to explain as well as , to a lesser degree , to the holdings of sight deposits at the SNB . 
in the broader aggregates , the increase has been due to the decline in domestic interest rates . 
this trend was likely to stabilise however in coming months . 
at the same time the modest growth in bank credit would not suggest any excessive money growth . 
meanwhile , the weak economy was expected to begin to revive during the second half of the year . 
&quot; One expects an improvement in the gross domestic product to slightly over 1.0 percent during the fourth quarter . 
in 1998 , growth is unlikely to exceed 2.00 percent , &quot; Meyer said . 
he noted Switzerland &apos;s production potential remained well below capacity . 
in view of that , inflation pressures should remain limited . 
at the same time , Swiss long-term interest rates remained quite stable , he said . 
given the uncertain outlook for the economy , a modification of monetary policy would not be considered until the economy showed convincing signs of a recovery , Meyer said .
