the London International Financial futures and Options Exchange ( LIFFE ) said on Monday that 18.4 million contracts were traded last month , the exchange &apos;s highest ever monthly volume . 
the figure represented a 68 percent leap from October 1995 &apos;s volume and replaced the previous monthly record set in February this year , LIFFE said in a statement . 
for the year to date , LIFFE volumes were 140.97 million contracts , up 24 percent on the same period last year , it said . 
he said volumes had broken through to new highs because of ever-increasing interest in European Economic and Monetary Union and volatility surrounding a 25 basis point interest rate rise in Britain last week . 
individual records were set in Euromark futures , which reached a new daily volume high , and Eurolira , Euroswiss and short sterling futures , which each set new monthly peaks .
