factory orders fell for the first time in three months in November , the Commerce Department said Tuesday , partially reversing a strong showing in the prior month but doing little to convince analysts the economy was turning weaker . 
the department said orders fell 0.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 320.5 billion after rising a revised 1.1 percent in October . 
but shipments of finished products , order backlogs and inventories continued to rise , the department said , suggesting underlying strength in the industrial sector toward the end of last year , analysts said . 
the department said shipments rose 0.9 percent while unfilled orders and inventories were up 0.4 percent . 
&quot; Shipments and inventories were on the strong side , &quot; said economist Russell Sheldon of Mellon Bank , &quot; suggesting the fourth quarter may be stronger than most people are saying . 
he said the buildup in inventories by itself could have suggested that demand had fallen off but the fact that shipments were strong made this possibility unlikely . 
&quot; They are accumulating inventory because they think they have the customers , &quot; Sheldon added . 
the economy in recent weeks sent out some signals that it might have been growing stronger as 1996 drew to a close , raising concerns among some on Wall Street that the inflation-wary Federal Reserve might intervene to slow the pace by raising interest rates . 
but the stock market has generally brushed off this threat . 
the Dow Jones industrial average hit a record of 6,567.18 Monday before giving up some ground Tuesday . 
the Dow was off about 40 points in afternoon trading Tuesday . 
the Commerce Department previously said October factory orders had risen 0.9 percent . 
wall Street analysts had forecast a decline of 0.6 percent for November . 
orders for durable goods such as new cars and refrigerators fell 1.5 percent to $ 172.3 billion after rising 0.6 percent in October . 
the department had reported that orders of durable goods fell 1.6 percent in November , reducing the decline slightly in the latest report . 
but analysts said durable goods orders were notoriously volatile with changes from month to month masking the true pattern of activity . 
orders for nondurables such as food and paper products continued to show healthy increases , rising 0.8 percent after a 1.6 percent gain in October . 
among durable products , electronic and electrical equipment registered the largest drop in orders , falling 9.1 percent , after a 17.2 percent October gain . 
Nondurables , however , were bouyed by increases in printing and publishing , textile mill products , apparel and some food products . 
in a separate report , BTM / Schroders reported that U.S. chain store sales fell 1.0 percent in the week ended Jan . 4 from the prior week . 
however , they were up 4.3 percent on a year-over-year basis .
