Greece &apos;s socialist Prime Minister Costas Simitis announced on Thursday that early general elections will be held on September 22 . 
&quot; I will visit tomorrow the president of the republic to request the parliament &apos;s dissolution and ask for elections to be held on Sunday , September 22 , &quot; Simitis told reporters after chairing a special cabinet meeting . 
Simitis cited as reasons for the early poll problems with the country &apos;s ailing economy and tense relations with neighbouring Turkey . 
elections were originally scheduled to be held in October next year . 
Simitis , 60 , is one of Greece &apos;s most popular politicians and and poll analysts have said his PASOK socialist party has a slight edge over the conservative New Democracy main opposition party . 
Simitis , who replaced late party founder Andreas Papandreou as premier in January , wants a public mandate to push on with tough economic decisions aimed to bring Greece in line with its European Union partners
