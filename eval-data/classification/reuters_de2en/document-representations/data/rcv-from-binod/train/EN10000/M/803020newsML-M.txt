the mark recovered from earlier lows on its European crosses on Friday , boosted by a sharp fall in the dollar . 
dealers cited nervousness ahead of the Bundesbank repo tender on Tuesday and council meeting on Thursday as well as thin , technically-dominated trade as reasons for the late shake-up . 
&quot; The mark / crosses is taking its cue from the dollar / mark slide , &quot; said a trader at a UK bank . 
dollar / mark slumped in U.S dealings , falling to a low of 1.8155 marks . 
U.S. asset markets also weakened sharply . 
the Dow Industrials tumbled over 100 points and Germany &apos;s IBIS Dax index was also weaker , dipping below 4,100 points in afternoon dealings . 
traders said with much of Europe away on holiday , movements in the mark crosses had been exacerbated due to thin volumes .
