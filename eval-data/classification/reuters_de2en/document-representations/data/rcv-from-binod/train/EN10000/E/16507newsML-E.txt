the Brazilian government and representatives of the country &apos;s states have reached an agreement over a bill which would reduce taxes on exports and make industry more competitive , a minister said . 
the agreement paves the way for the Chamber of Deputies to vote later on Tuesday on a motion giving the bill priority treatment in the lower house , Parlimentary Affairs Minister Luiz Carlos Santos told reporters . 
Santos said a vote on the bill itself might yet take place on Tuesday . 
if not , the vote would be scheduled for Wednesday . 
analysts say that Brazil could boost exports by as much as four percent by exempting them from the so-called ICMS tax , as proposed in the bill . 
the new law would also exempt from ICMS goods and energy consumed in the manufacturing process .
