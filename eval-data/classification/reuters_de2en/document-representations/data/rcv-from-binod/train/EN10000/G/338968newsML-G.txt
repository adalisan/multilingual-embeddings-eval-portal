Greece will extradite a German woman in connection with a deadly 1986 disco bombing in West Berlin , police officials said on Tuesday . 
the attack killed three people and wounded 200 , mostly U.S. military personnel . 
&quot; She will be on a flight to Germany on Wednesday , &quot; one official told Reuters . 
&quot; All documents have been signed by the justice minister and she did not appeal the extradition order . 
the woman , 31-year-old Andrea Hausler , was arrested last October in Halkidiki near the northern port city of Salonika at the request of German authorities . 
she was on vacation with her two-year-old son and boyfriend when arrested . 
police have said only that the woman was sought by the German authorities in connection with the disco bombing . 
two U.S. soldiers and a Turkish woman were killed in the 1986 attack on the &quot; La belle &quot; disco in Berlin &apos;s Schoeneberg district , and scores of off-duty U.S. military personnel were wounded . 
the United States blamed Libya for the blast and responded by bombing the Arab state , killing at least 15 people and wounding more than 100 . 
two other people were arrested in Germany in October in connection with the attack .
