the voracious investor appetite seen in 1996 for foreign bonds denominated in New Zealand dollars shows few signs of fading this year , analysts said on Wednesday . 
the market for eurokiwis exploded in 1996 with more than 40 issues carrying a total face value of around NZ $ 4.8 billion ( US $ 3.4 billion ) , compared with just three bonds in the previous two years . 
already , 1997 has seen three issues , each with a face value of NZ $ 100 million . 
dual currency samurai borrowing also powered ahead in 1996 , with around NZ $ 3.8 billion worth of issuance since July . 
high New Zealand interest rates relative to the rest of the world drove the boom , along with an appreciating currency and high quality issuers . 
analysts said demand remains strong despite a rally of more than 200 basis points in two and three year bonds since late June , which has dragged eurokiwi coupons down to around seven percent from a high of 9.50 percent . 
new Zealand interest rates are still high relative to global rates , which have also fallen . 
however , U.K rates look increasingly competitive as sterling firms , and could attract some of the attention that would otherwise be directed New Zealand &apos;s way in 1997 , analysts said . 
&quot; We have seen some of the money that might have come into New Zealand start to flow into the U.K. market , &quot; Westpac manager of derivative products Peter Adams told Reuters . 
Jonathan Stebbins , director of capital markets at Hambros Australia , part of British merchant bank Hambros Bank , agreed . 
&quot; The U.K ... is the standout factor , as a high quality currency which is offering high yields . 
indeed we have seen quite a few sterling issues over the last few days into Europe , and I &apos;m sure the Japanese are buying more sterling as well . 
Stebbins said spreads between New Zealand and global yields were contracting , which could work against the eurokiwi market later in 1997 , but at present investors still seemed content . 
&quot; kiwi yields ... in the dollar bloc sector still compare very well , and looking at the European currencies they still compare very well , &quot; Stebbins said . 
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t say the ( eurokiwi ) market has gained the same critical mass as the euro-aussie market , but it certainly has developed a following . 
it &apos;s not going to peter out quickly . 
Hambros Bank lead-managed two of the three eurokiwis issued to date in 1997 , the first for the Kingdom of Sweden and the second for KfW International Finance . 
&quot; Neither issue has rushed out the door but they are selling very steadily . 
we wouldn &apos;t have done the follow-up issue without the first one moving at a decent pace , &quot; Stebbins said . 
a chief foreign exchange dealer who declined to be named said a substantial amount of money was being poured into New Zealand , and the kiwi dollar remained &quot; flavour of the month &quot; . 
&quot; I think we &apos;ll reach a time where , in those samurais and eurokiwis , investor demand will dry up . 
but clearly at the moment some of the names we &apos;re seeing coming into the eurokiwi market indicate there is still solid demand out there , &quot; he said . 
Westpac &apos;s Adams said the currency could come under pressure from August onwards as approximately NZ $ 1.6 billion of the dual currency samurais issued in 1996 matured and investors received their principal in New Zealand dollars . 
&quot; The currency is more likely to come under pressure in the second half of the year as opposed to the first , &quot; he said . 
new Zealand &apos;s attractiveness relative to the rest of the world would be revealed when the bonds began to mature , Adams said . 
bondholders would either reinvest in New Zealand , lessening the impact on the kiwi , or take their money elsewhere .
