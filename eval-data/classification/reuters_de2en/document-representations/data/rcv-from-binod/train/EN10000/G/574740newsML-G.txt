heaven and Hangzhou are difficult to tell apart , goes the old Chinese saying . 
and heaven for China &apos;s tourism officials is written in the numbers they see when totting up receipts from the 10.4 million visitors who flock to the ancient capital each year . 
&quot; Hangzhou &apos;s scenery is like a traditional Chinese ink and water painting , &quot; said Bu Zhaohui , vice director and chief engineer of the Hangzhou Garden and relic Administration , and director of the Hangzhou scenery Garden Society . 
&quot; Hangzhou is China &apos;s most Chinese city , &quot; he told foreign reporters on a recent boat cruise on West Lake . 
Hangzhou came into its own as a major trading port in the early 12th Century , when it became the capital of the Southern Song Dynasty , and remained so until the mid-19th century when it was reduced to rubble during the Taiping Rebellion . 
Italian explorer Marco Polo described Hangzhou , when he passed through in the 13th Century , as one of the world &apos;s most splendid cities . 
it remains famous for its tea and silk . 
Hangzhou is often coupled on the tourist trail with nearby Suzhou , both major drawcards for the tourism industry of east China . 
&quot; Above us is heaven , here on earth we have Hangzhou and Suzhou , &quot; is the oft-repeated refrain when either is mentioned . 
Hangzhou is the star of Zhejiang &apos;s tourism industry , the sixth biggest in China , according to Yao Shenghou , the deputy director of the Zhejiang Provincial Travel and Tourism Bureau . 
tourism accounts for 6.2 percent of the province &apos;s gross domestic product ( GDP ) , earning Zhejiang a total of 27.1 billion yuan ( $ 3.265 billion ) in 1996 , official figures show . 
earnings from overseas visitors alone in 1996 were $ 292 million , up 23.7 percent on the 1995 figure , Yao said . 
foreign visitors in 1996 totalled 729,000 , 8.4 percent up on 1995 . 
the number of Chinese who visited Zhejiang rose in 1996 by 5.1 percent over 1995 , he said , to 37.73 million , earning the province 23.2 billion yuan , up 15 percent on 1995 . 
of these , 10 million Chinese and 400,000 foreigners went to Hangzhou and all of them visited West Lake , Hangzhou &apos;s Bu said . 
Hangzhou &apos;s major natural asset , the 3,000-year-old West Lake , is indeed beautiful , changing colour often with the mood of the hills that surround it and the sky that hangs heavy overhead . 
&quot; Hangzhou has more days of sunshine than rain , but people say West Lake is more beautiful when it rains because of the dreamy quality the mist brings , &quot; Bu said . 
&quot; And it is even more beautiful in the evening because the moon is reflected in the waters of the lake , &quot; he said . 
an inspiration for emperors and poets since it was formed by the silting of a bay , the land-blocked West Lake covers 5.6 sq km ( 2.16 miles ) , has a drainage area of 60 sq km ( 23 sq miles ) and takes its waters from the nearby Qiantang River . 
it is the job of Bu &apos;s office to make sure West Lake retains its beauty , and does not fall prey to the environmental degradation that is symptomatic of China &apos;s great economic leap towards the 21st century . 
progress has been made , Bu said . 
in 1949 , when the Chinese Communist Party took power , the lake held filthy stagnant water just 50 cm ( 20 in ) deep , run-off from the surrounding hills that had been denuded by poor peasants desperate for food and fuel , Bu said . 
&quot; In the 1950s the government carried out a large-scale reafforestation project and in 1958 the river was dredged , &quot; Bu said . 
in 1990 , the Hangzhou city government invested 20 million yuan ( $ 2.4 million ) to build an underground pipeline from the Qiantang River to draw river water into the lake , he said . 
now the lake is 1.5 metres ( 4.6 FT ) deep and the water is transparent to a depth of up to one metre ( 3.28 FT ) , he said . 
silt from the dredging was used to build the three tiny islands that dot the lake . 
the biggest of them is called Three pools mirroring the Moon . 
so far , 1.1 billion yuan ( $ 130 million ) has been invested to protect the lake and surrounding areas from pollution , Bu said . 
another 120 million yuan ( $ 14.4 million ) a year is spent on construction and repairs , Bu said , reeling off a list of departments and teams -- including flag-waving school children who spend weekends patrolling the lake and chiding litter-dropping tourists -- created to preserve West Lake . 
but problems remain , Bu said , as 300,000 tonnes of raw sewage is pumped into the lake every day because the local sewage treatment plant has a daily capacity of only 400,000 tonnes . 
&quot; Now we are waiting for loans to expand the capacity of the treatment plant , &quot; he said .
