Bombay blue chips retreated from their session peaks on Wednesday in volatile trade weighed by profit-taking , but mostly managed to end with modest gains over the previous close , traders said . 
&quot; When the market started falling , it triggered off limit orders , &quot; said Ashith Kampani , head of dealing at JM Share &amp; Stock brokers . 
Wednesday &apos;s intra-day drop could pave the way for a healthy correction , giving an opportunity for investors to re-enter the market , players said . 
&quot; There should be a nice correction from here till Friday , &quot; Kampani said . 
the boom has been driven by huge cash inflows by domestic and foreign investors , analysts said . 
Bombay &apos;s blue chip gauge hit 4,395.31 points in late afternoon trade beating 4,386.43 reached on October 14 , 1994 . 
&quot; There might be a short-term melt-down but the market has more to go , &quot; said Bharat Iyer , strategist at UBS Securities , the investment arm of Union Bank of Switzerland . 
&quot; We &apos;re maintaining our target of 4,600-4,700 by December 1997 , &quot; he said . 
the participation of stocks such as TISCO , Bajaj Auto and Hindalco which have underperformed in the recent rally were signs of the surge percolating to many stocks , traders said . 
&quot; Funds should ideally flow into equities when interest rates start falling , &quot; said Deepak Mehta , equities trader at reliance Capital Ltd . &quot; This is exactly what &apos;s happening . 
since April 1 , the central bank &apos;s key bank rate has dropped by two percentage points to 10 percent .
