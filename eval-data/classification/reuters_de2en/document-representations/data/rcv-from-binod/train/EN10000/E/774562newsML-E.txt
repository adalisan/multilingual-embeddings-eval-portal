Australia &apos;s economy is set for a strong pick up in growth , with an imminent recovery , falling unemployment , steady inflation and a recovery in the retail and manufacuturing sectors , a leading forecaster said on Monday . 
&quot; Yes , there is a recovery coming , &quot; said Access Economics in its latest five-year business outlook . 
access projected economic growth to accelerate from 2.9 percent in 1997 / 97 to 3.9 percent in 1997 / 97 and 4.6 percent the following year . 
official government forecasts estimate 3.25 percent growth in the year to June 30 this year rising to 3.75 
percent at the end of 1997 / 98 . 
unemployment , which has remain stubbornly stuck above 8.5 percent since the Liberal-National government was elected in March 1996 , could fall below 8.0 percent by late 1998 , for the first time since 1990 . 
&quot; believe it or not , the good times are coming , &quot; Access said . 
but it cautioned that the biggest risk to a speedy economic recovery was poor consumer confidence , which could hit retail spending . 
&quot; accordingly , part of what we should fear is fear itself , &quot; Access said . 
&quot; A spate of bad news stories is extending the gloom from consumers to business even though the economic fundamentals are on the rise . 
&quot; That does not put recovery at risk , as recovery would still occur . 
rather , it risks a delay in recovery from late 1997 to mid-1998 . 
Australia &apos;s improving economic performance would also be underpinned by favourable conditions worldwide , especially in the United States . 
&quot; The global economy will be pushing into overdrive for the first time in the 1990s , &quot; the report said . 
access sees more business sectors -- especially job creating sectors such as retail , manufacturing and building -- sharing in the economic good fortune , and boosting jobs growth in turn . 
unemployment would likely dip below 8.0 percent in 1998 , possibly as low as 7.8 percent , before climbing again in the next slowdown about 2000 . 
but Access saw a less rosy outlook for inflation and the farming sector . 
the recent interest rate cuts and low-dollar inspired retail price falls that had helped tame inflation would soon fade , and wages would spike up . 
this couls see underlying inflation rising above 3.0 percent , breaking out of the Reserve Bank &apos;s 2-3 percent target band . 
access saw the next movement in interest rates going up , and probably in early 1998 . 
Australia &apos;s valuable farming sector is expected to go into reverse , largely due to adverse weather , with output falling 6.0 percent in 1997 / 98 and a further 6.4 percent in 1998 / 99 .
