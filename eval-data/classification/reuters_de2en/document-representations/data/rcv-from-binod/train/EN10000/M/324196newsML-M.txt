the South Africa &apos;s rand could prove &quot; very stable &quot; in 1997 , declining by less than inflation deifferentials , Reserve Bank Govwernor Chris Stals said on Thursday . 
he told Reuters in a telephone interview there was a growing mood of optimism in the market which he believed was justified by economic fundamentals as the South African economy headed into a year of consolidation . 
this would see a sharp improvement in the country &apos;s current acount deficit which could well shrink to 4.0-5.0 billion rand from around 10 billion in 1996 . 
in the longer-term , however , on a horizon of five years or so , the exchange rate of the rand would inevitably move in line with inflation differentials between South Africa and its major trading partners , he added . 
Stals said he expected economic growth to slow to around two percent in 1997 from some three percent in 1996 while inflation should average less than 10 percent . 
the full effects of the rand &apos;s fall of nearly 30 percent against the dollar in 1996 had yet to feed through and inflation could edge higher from the 9.2 percnet recorded in November , but the rate would peak later in the year , he said . 
the current account of the balance of payments , a crucial indicator for investors edgy about the rand &apos;s stability , would improve sharply in 1997 , Stals said . 
&quot; If last year &apos;s deficit was about 10 billion rand , it could be half of that this year -- about four to five billion rand . 
this year &apos;s rash of Eurorand bond issues was also a sign of growing confidence in the South African currency and the economic outlook . 
&quot; Some of it is replacing maturing loans , so on a net basis it is not such a big amount . 
but until a month ago or so it would have been difficult even to roll over maturing loans , and it is encouraging that European investors are prepared to take new positions in rand , &quot; Stals said . 
the South African currency market saw the rand push to a new seven-and-a-half week high on Wednesday while long bonds pierced key technical levels to trade at new three-month highs as a mood of optimism continued to encourage local and offshore buyers . 
the rand closed locally at 4.6300 / 6350 , more than two cents up on the day despite a very strong dollar . 
&quot; Looking at the developments of last year and prospects for this year and the general economic situation in South Africa with some slowdown in economic activity , I think the markets are right to think the time has come for some consoldiation in the rand exchange rate , &quot; Stals commented .
