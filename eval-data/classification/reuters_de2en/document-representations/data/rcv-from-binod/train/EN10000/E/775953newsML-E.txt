the International Monetary Fund Monday gave the nation &apos;s policy-makers two thumbs-up for their handling of the economy but warned they needed to be careful about the danger of rising inflationary pressures . 
while noting the U.S. economy was performing &quot; exceptionally well , &quot; the IMF executive board also said in a summary of its annual review of the U.S. economy &quot; that an immediate policy challenge was to guard against the emergence of inflationary pressures . 
&quot; Directors agreed that the U.S. monetary authorities would need to remain vigilant , &quot; the statement said . 
the IMF noted the economy was running at high capacity and cautioned that temporary factors that had helped to keep inflation in check , such as slowly rising labour costs , the strong dollar and weak growth elsewhere in the world , were &quot; likely to diminish in the period ahead . 
but the fund &apos;s directors appeared to be split on the need for higher short-term interest rates to ward off inflation . 
the statement said several directors saw no immediate need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates but those members of the board recognised higher rates may be needed in the future should the economy grow faster than expected . 
the statement also said &quot; many other &quot; directors had urged a pre-emptive , moderate rate increase and warned that an &quot; undue delay &quot; would risk letting inflationary pressures build . 
the Fed , the nation &apos;s central bank , raised short-term rates in March , the first increase in more than two years , but has held rates steady since . 
fed policy-makers are to meet on Aug . 19 to weigh their strategy on rates . 
while giving a generally upbeat assessment , the IMF also criticised the rising trading deficit and level of debt . 
&quot; The persistence of large U.S. current account deficits and growing international indebtedness would be a concern over the medium term , &quot; it said . 
the statement also urged Washington to step up its leadership role and purshing trade liberalisation in agricultural products , textiles and other important areas . 
it said it regretted the drop in U.S. aid to developing countries and said it had urged the authorities to reverse the trend . 
it also called on Washington to meet its commitments to international financial institutions .
