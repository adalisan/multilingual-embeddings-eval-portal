Cambodian troops are shoring up forces around the rebel Khmer Rouge stronghold of Anlong Veng as negotiations over the fate of 15 officials being held hostage appeared to stall , officials said on Saturday . 
the news came as clandestine Khmer Rouge radio reported that guerrillas had attacked a village in central Cambodia , killing two provincial officials . 
military officials told Reuters by telephone that negotiations with the Khmer Rouge hardliners in the northwest jungle base of Anlong Veng , near the Thai border , appeared to be breaking down . 
infamous one-legged Khmer Rouge military chief Ta Mok told military officials by radio Friday night that he would not let them speak to 15 government staff held since February 14 , a witness told Reuters . 
the 15 had flown by helicopter into the area to negotiate with Ta Mok . 
the government has said it will soon tell Ta Mok to hand over the detained staff or face attack . 
&quot; The office of general staff has not officially ordered an attack in Anlong Veng ... but we are strengthening our forces , &quot; said one senior military official by telephone from the northwest province of Siem Reap . 
another official said Deputy Chief of General Staff Lieutenant General MEAs Sophea had travelled to the northwest on Saturday to coordinate the operation , but officials would reveal the number of troops being moved into the area . 
Khmer Rouge radio on Saturday said Khmer Rouge rebels and a group of farmers killed two civilian authorities , detained eight people and confiscated 15 weapons in Baray village in Kompong Cham province on Wednesday . 
military analysts said the Khmer Rouge had been stepping up operations in recent weeks , particularly near Route 6 which runs through Kompong Cham and north into the province of Kompong Thom , where rebels control remote pockets of territory . 
Kompong Thom has historically been a hotbed of Khmer Rouge activity and is the birthplace of the rebels &apos; leader , Pol Pot , under whose 1975-79 &quot; killing fields &quot; rule more than a million Cambodians died . 
the Khmer Rouge have been severely weakened by thousands of defections and are now believed to number fewer than than 2,000 , mostly in Anlong Veng . 
the Khmer Rouge signed U.N.-sponsored peace pact in 1991 , but reneged on the deal and have been fighting the government which came to power after 1993 elections .
