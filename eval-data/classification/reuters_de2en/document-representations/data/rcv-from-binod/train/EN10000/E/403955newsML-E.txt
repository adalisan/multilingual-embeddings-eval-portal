Bulgaria &apos;s interim cabinet will seek to reschedule debt payments due to the Paris Club of official creditors this year and may reach a funding agreement with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) next week , Finance Minister Svetoslav Gavriiski said on Wednesday . 
speaking after a meeting between a visiting IMF mission and a financial stabilisation council set up by the interim cabinet to speed up reform , Gavriiski said : 
&quot; Tomorrow Prime Minister Stefan Sofianski is going to send a letter to the Paris Club , in which we will ask to reschedule payments which are due this year . 
he said that Bulgaria sought to reschedule up to $ 50 million due from part of the non-rescheduled payments . 
Bulgaria has so far paid these amounts regularly , but an economic crisis caused by continuous mishandling of the economy has depleted its reserves . 
&quot; Our request to is to roll over these payments for next year . 
this year every sum of funds is significant for us , &quot; said Gavriiski . 
under three agreements rescheduling a $ 1.2 billion debt owed to the Paris Club by 1995 , Bulgaria is due to pay official creditors $ 126 million this year . 
&quot; We would like to start negotiations with the Paris Club for possible rescheduling of the other obligations as well , &quot; said Gavriiski . 
Bulgaria was likely to reach a preliminary funding agreement with the IMF which will enable the interim cabinet to halt the freefall of the national currency , the Lev . 
&quot; There are possiblities during the visit of this IMF mission to prepare a programme for the next standby arrangement , &quot; said Gavriiski . 
&quot; Such a programme can be approved with this government and receive the first tranche of the funding in the term of this caretaker government , &quot; he said . 
Bulgaria &apos;s president appointed the interim cabinet three weeks ago after disbanding parliament and setting early general elections for April 19 .
