Bellwether broken Hill Pty Co Ltd led the Australian share market to a lower close on Thursday as traders expressed concern about the costs and direction of its mineral division . 
the All Ordinaries index lost 9.4 points to 2,717.7 . 
on Wednesday , BHP announced the surprise departure of mineral division head Dick Carter and also flagged a cost blow-out at its hot briquetted iron project in Western Australia . 
traders said many investors had decided to step aside while the market giant , accounting for nearly nine percent of the index , sorted itself out . 
&quot; People would rather sell out and watch to see what happens , &quot; said a dealer at a Sydney-based investment bank . 
elsewhere , brokers said the market was patchy but steady with some of Wednesday &apos;s surprising strength washing out today . 
&quot; Yesterday was very surprising because there wasn &apos;t much to give it any joy from overseas , &quot; said Reynolds and Co dealer Grant Williams , a view shared by other traders who noted the mixed showing today as a consolidation of those gains . 
July employment data was broadly in line with market expectations and provided few clues about the direction of interest rates . 
&quot; It is always a difficult company to analyse . 
people will still be taking in the result , &quot; said the investment bank dealer . 
this followed the overnight release of results from GKN plc , its partner in the Chep pallet business in the U.S. 
Australia &apos;s largest retailer Coles Myer ended two cents higher at A $ 6.92 after reporting a 5.8 percent increase in year sales to A $ 19.23 billion . 
Coles said it maintained its view of second half profit growth similar to the first half . 
national Foods topped turnover lists with 25.7 million shares traded , the bulk of them being the sale of Malaysia-listed investment group Camerlin PTE Ltd &apos;s 10 percent stake . 
the shares were dispersed to a range of institutions . 
falls outnumbered rises by a ratio of about nine to eight , while about 27 percent of stocks traded remained steady .
