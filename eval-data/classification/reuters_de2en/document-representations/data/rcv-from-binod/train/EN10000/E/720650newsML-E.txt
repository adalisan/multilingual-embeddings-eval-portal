Irish analysts said on Thursday that there was no cause for alarm in June consumer price figures released on Thursday . 
the data was slightly above most market expectations but analysts said there was no evidence that the punt &apos;s sharp fall against sterling in the first half had yet fed through to inflation . 
the main factors behind the increase in June were food , transport and housing , all volatile components of the CPI index , but analysts said punt / sterling weakness may yet show up in the data in the months ahead . 
&quot; The inflation numbers themselves were a bit of a non-entity . 
June consumer prices rose by 0.3 percent against forecasts of 0.2 percent while they increased by 1.8 percent on a 13-month basis . 
a 12-month comparison was not possible due to the lack of comparable data for June 1996 . 
analysts said food , which rose by 0.7 percent on the month , housing which posted a 0.9 percent increase , and transport , up 0.6 percent , were the main factors boosting the index . 
&quot; There is no evidence in these numbers of the fall of the punt against sterling which is what the market is really concerned about , &quot; Padhraic Garvey , economist at Riada stockbrokers told Reuters . 
Garvey noted that the clothing and footwear component of the CPI index fell 0.5 percent in June , durable household goods were down 0.1 percent and other goods fell 0.1 percent on the month . 
&quot; Those three sectors are very sensitive to sterling so the fact that those three sectors have fallen on the month shows that the currency is as yet not feeding through , &quot; he said . 
but analysts warn that price pressures could show up further down the line . 
Davy stockbrokers &apos; Jim O &apos;Leary cautioned that it was difficult to draw robust inferences from the June data because there are no comparable figures for 1996 making it impossible to know what seasonal patterns typically obtain between May and June . 
&quot; I am inclined , though this is necessarily tentative , to the view that the June figures will prove to be a turning point , &quot; he told Reuters . 
&quot; It &apos;s long been our view that the exchange rate movements that have occurred since last September will eventually feed through . 
whatever the future holds , analysts say June &apos;s data should have little market impact as it &apos;s unlikely to result in any change in Irish monetary policy . 
despite central bank concerns about the rate of Irish credit growth and the weakness of the Irish pound , analysts say there the bank is highly unlikely to take pre-emptive action against inflation on the basis of June &apos;s figures alone . 
&quot; I would be amazed if the bank took action on the basis of one months &apos; figures , given in particular that this is a month in which the figures are especially difficult to interpret , &quot; Davy &apos;s O &apos;Leary said .
