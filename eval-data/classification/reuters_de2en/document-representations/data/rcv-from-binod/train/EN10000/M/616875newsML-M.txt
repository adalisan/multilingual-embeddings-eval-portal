U.S. spot residual fuel prices mostly lost ground Tuesday in sluggish trade , with crumbling crude , soft demand and talk of HSFO barrels from Europe weighing particularly on high sulphur grades , sources said . 
&quot; There &apos;s supposed to be some European high sulphur on the way and there &apos;s no load , &quot; said one cash trader , noting buyers backed away as NYMEX July crude tumbled 84 cents today . 
new York Harbor high sulphurs slipped more than a quarter a barrel , with 2.2 percent pegged in the $ 14.50-75 area amid talk of cargoes headed this way from Europe , traders said . 
while low sulphurs held better than higher grades , traders said the lack of heating or cooling load and cheaper natgas promised little upside potential near-term . 
NYH physical one percent eased slightly to about $ 16.50 a barrel , with June one percent paper down at least a quarter to $ 16.75 on weaker crude , traders said . 
NYH 0.3 percent high pour also notionally lost ground , with fairly prompt delivered sellers heard in the $ 17.25 area , 25 cents or more below Friday &apos;s levels . 
at the U.S. Gulf , one percent firmed slightly to the low- $ 16s , while three percent slipped slightly to $ 14.25-50 . 
new York city gate swing gas prices gained about a nickel Tuesday to the high- $ 2.40s / mmBtu , or $ 15.56 a barrel equivalent . 
gas at Henry hub , the NYMEX delivery point , rallied a dime to about $ 2.29 / mmBtu , or $ 14.43 a barrel .
