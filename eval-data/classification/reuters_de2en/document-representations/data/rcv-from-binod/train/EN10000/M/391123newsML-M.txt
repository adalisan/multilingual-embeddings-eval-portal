high sulphur fuel oil edged down slightly because of the slow return of Chinese buying to the market amid rising stocks in Singapore , traders said . 
&quot; The Chinese are sniffing but they don &apos;t want to pay current market prices , &quot; one trader said . 
traders said China is looking to secure March barrels at around $ 107.00 per tonne or $ 7.50 per tonne over spot Singapore quotes on a cost-and-freight basis , between $ 2- $ 4 per tonne below sellers &apos; offered price . 
downward pressure also came from worries over unsold March barrels from South Korea which had recently sold some cargoes to China . 
bunker sellers said sales are slowing due to higher prices in Singapore compared to South Korea resulting in some shipowners taking minimal volumes in Singapore and filling up in South Korea . 
as a result of the poor sales , residual stocks in Singapore for the week ended February 19 rose by 195,000-barrels to 10.255 million barrels , Trade Development Board shows . 
in the local physical market a 20,000-tonne cargo for loading March 18-22 traded between a European major and a local trader at $ 102.50 per tonne , $ 2.00 below Wednesday &apos;s offered level . 
March fuel oil swaps quotes were slightly weaker at $ 102.25 / $ 103.00 per tonne from $ 102.75 / $ 103.50 on Wednesday . 
Taiwan issued a tender to buy 76,000 tonnes of low sulphur fuel oil for April 1-15 delivery . 
the tender closes on February 26 and is valid until February 28 . 
the shutdown of the 83,000-bpd hydrocracker at Balongan also would not add much surplus to the market as the topper throughput has been reduced , said a source close to the refinery .

traders said low sulphur waxy residue prices in March are expected to remain stable in the $ 20- $ 21 per barrel or at 40-70 cents premium range over the Pertamina formula . 
&quot; It is fairly balanced ... there is no particular push in either direction , &quot; said a trader with a major oil company . 
Indonesia allocated 3.7 million barrels for March , steady from February &apos;s initial allocation , but lower considering an additional 900,000 barrels were allocated later in February . 
traders said the lifting programme had yet to be finalised but 1.9 million was available from platinum , 800,000 barrels from Balikpapan , 400,000 barrels each from Sungei Pakning and Sambu Jetti and 200,000 from Dumai . 
they said supply from Dumai was slightly lower due to the 38-day turnaround of the 120,000-bpd refinery from February 22 . 
&quot; Dumai isn &apos;t a huge producer - usually 400,000 barrels a month -- it ( the shutdown ) has a neglible effect , &quot; said a trader .
