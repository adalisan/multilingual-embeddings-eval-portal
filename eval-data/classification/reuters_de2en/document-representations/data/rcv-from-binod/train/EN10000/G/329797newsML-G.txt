Dennis Rodman , suspended for 11 games and fined $ 25,000 in a kicking incident , will give up his paycheck from a number of games when he returns to the court , it was reported Friday . 
the Chicago Sun-Times quoted the agent for the Chicago bulls star as saying a &quot; significant &quot; number of games would be involved and that the money -- about $ 109,000 per game -- would go to charity or be returned to the team . 
in a game last week in Minneapolis , Rodman stumbled out of bounds , tripping over cameraman Eugene Amos and kicking at him as he got up off the floor . 
Amos , in a delayed reaction , slumped over for more than five minutes before he was carried off and taken to a hospital . 
Rodman was suspended for at least 11 games without pay , fined $ 25,000 and ordered to see a counsellor . 
he also agreed to pay the cameraman $ 200,000 in an out-of-court settlement . 
in a television interview earlier in the week Rodman said he kicked at the man &apos;s camera and not at his groin , calling the contact a mere &quot; tap .
