defence lawyers in the Army rape trial of Staff Sgt. 
Delmar Simpson rested their case Tuesday , after witnesses testified that two of his alleged victims had said their sexual encounters were unpleasant . 
two witnesses , who had been called to bolster the defence argument that Simpson only had consensual sex with female trainees , said two of the six women he is accused of raping had said they were either unhappy or angry with Simpson . 
&quot; ( Rape ) wasn &apos;t actually said , but when she was talking to me about it , it wasn &apos;t a happy feeling . 
Hannah Pitt , describing a conversation with one of the trainees Simpson is alleged to have raped . 
Pitt had previously told investigators the trainee and Simpson had had consensual sex . 
Simpson , 32 , is charged with 19 counts of rape involving six women , and with 35 other counts including indecent exposure , battery and maltreatment . 
he has pleaded innocent to those charges but has admitted 11 counts of improper sexual intercourse with trainees and five of propositioning . 
Simpson &apos;s lawyers have argued that all of Simpson &apos;s sexual encounters were consensual , and reflected an atmosphere of wanton sexual activity at the Army &apos;s Orndance Centre and School , part of the Aberdeen proving Ground . 
Simpson is the first of 12 trainers at the proving ground charged with sexual misconduct to go to trial , although four other cases have been resolved through plea agreements or administrative means . 
a military jury is expected to begin deliberations on the Simpson case later this week , following a prosecution rebuttal , closing arguments , and instructions . 
Scott Alexander , who oversaw Simpson and other drill sergeants at the ordnance centre and School , testified Tuesday that he had no explanation for being unaware of sexual misconduct there . 
&quot; It &apos;s very disturbing to me that such events have occurred , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s beyond me why there was not any inkling whatsoever to any of the misconduct conditions . 
army Judge Col. Paul Johnston said , in a discussion with lawyers outside of the jurors &apos; presence , that official ordnance centre policy encouraging an open atmosphere for reporting sexual harassment appearently was ignored . 
&quot; The culture within the unit was that they didn &apos;t report , &quot; ( violations ) , he said . 
also testifying Tuesday , Pvt. 
Donna Jackson said the trainee Pitt had testified about had sex with Simpson more than once . 
but she also acknowledged , under cross-examination from prosecutor Capt. 
Theresa Gallagher , that the woman tried to warn others about drill sergeants at the facility . 
&quot; She was also warning you about the drill sergeants , that they did cruddy things to people ? 
&quot; Gallagher said . 
&quot; Yes , ma &apos;am , &quot; Jackson said . 
referring to a conversation with the woman regarding an encounter with Simpson , Jackson said , &quot; She didn &apos;t say &apos; rape &apos; to me when I spoke to her that night , but she was angry towards him ( Simpson ) . 
E-4 Tamila Carrington , who acknowledged having sex with Simpson , testified that an alleged rape victim was laughing about her sexual experience with Simpson . 
Carrington said she reunited with her Aberdeen friend a year later . 
Carrington said she believed that if her friend was raped , she would have told her .
