the South African rand hit a record low on Wednesday , trading at over 4.70 to the dollar for the first time as speculative pressure continued , traders said . 
by 0820 GMT the rand had slipped to 4.7080 / 7130 , down from 4.6865 / 15 on Tuesday and a loss of 29 percent since mid-February . 
against the British pound , the rand sank to a new low of 7.58 . 
dealers said the rand was being hit by sales from both international speculators and domestic importers who are rushing to buy dollars to pay for essential goods from overseas . 
analysts say investors have been spooked by South Africa &apos;s balance of payments difficulties and the dangerously low level of foreign reserves , which stood at 10.0 billion rand ( $ 2.1 billion ) at the end of September , equivalent to four weeks import cover .
