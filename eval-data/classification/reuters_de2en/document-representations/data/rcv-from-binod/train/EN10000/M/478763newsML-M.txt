Caracas stocks closed off in thin trade , unmoved by news that leading companies CANTV and Electricidad de Caracas had declared dividend payments for the year , traders said . 
while foreign funds continue to wait out Venezuelan equities , locals investors were unimpressed by CANTV &apos;s announcement late Monday of 13.24 Bolivar per share dividend , traders said , leaving other share prices wallowing in a lackluster session . 
&quot; That &apos;s only 0.6 percent of the share price -- okay if you didn &apos;t expect anything , &quot; said one broker in a typical comment . 
nevertheless as CANTV was not due to begin dividend payments until 1998 , this dividend is &quot; a good sign that the company is making profits and paying them out , &quot; said Intervalores broker , Ricardo Marino . 
&quot; Let &apos;s hope next year the payment will be larger , &quot; he added . 
leading utility Electricidad de Caracas also said it would pay a three Bolivar per share cash dividend , plus a one share per 25 stock dividend , but the announcement similary failed to move the market . 
Merinvest &apos;s composite index , which includes CANTV , fell 0.81 points to end at 95.98 points . 
among traded issues , 27 fell , eight rose and five closed flat . 
Electricidad &apos;s dividend announcement followed a decision late Monday to increase the ceiling on the company &apos;s authorized capital to 335 billion bolivars from 204 billion . 
the company , which currently has some 168 billion bolivars of paid-in capital , annually increases the limit to allow for share dividends . 
the Bolsa &apos;s 19-share index fell 0.16 percent to close at 6,321.19 points as eight million shares traded , worth 1.5 billion bolivars ( $ 3 million ) , according to preliminary figures from the exchange .
