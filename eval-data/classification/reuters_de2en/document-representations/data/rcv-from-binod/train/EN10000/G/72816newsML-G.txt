a tourist tunnel at the centre of a fresh Arab-Israeli dispute takes visitors on a journey through 2,500 years of Jerusalem history including the time of Jesus , Israel &apos;s Tourism Ministry said . 
Israel triggered Palestinian protests when its workmen on Tuesday put in a second entrance to the tunnel which was opened several years ago beside Jerusalem &apos;s Temple Mount , site of Islam &apos;s third holiest shrine . 
a ministry news release said visitors to the tunnel can explore a Hasmonean water system carved out in the Second Century B.C. 
and walk along a Herodian street -- possibly on the same stones where Jesus once walked . 
the 488-metre ( 500-yard ) tunnel is less than a metre-wide and spans almost the entire Wailing Wall abutting the ancient Jewish Temple Mount . 
it passes the wall &apos;s largest stone , which weighs 570 metric tonnes , and ends in the Struthion pool documented by Josephus Flavius 1,900 years ago . 
until now only 70,000 people were able to visit each year as they were forced to enter and leave through the same opening . 
the ministry said the second opening and a restoration of the tunnel would enable 400,000 people to visit each year . 
the tunnel passes through huge subterranean vaults built in the 14th century during the Mamluk period , a medieval cistern , and a gateway to the Temple Mount reconstructed by early Moslem inhabitants of Jerusalem and rediscovered by British archaeologist Charles Warren in 1867 . 
the tour includes a quarry from which the Wailing Wall &apos;s stones were excavated and other remnants of &quot; Underground Jerusalem , &quot; the title of a famous account by Warren .
