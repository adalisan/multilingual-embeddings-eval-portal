&quot; Changes are going in the right direction , &quot; the director of NATO &apos;s International Military Staff , General Gerret Folmer , told reporters after meetings with Defence Minister Stanislaw Dobrzanski and other top Polish military officials . 
Poland is reforming its armed forces to make them compatible with those of NATO regarding communications , command procedures , language , maps and management of air space by 1999 , when it hopes to join the Western military alliance . 
it is tipped to be invited to join the pact at NATO &apos;s Madrid summit in July together with the Czech Republic and Hungary , despite strong opposition from Russia . 
Poland now has 233,000 troops , 1,720 tanks and 440 fighter aircraft , and military analysts say the armed forces should become leaner but more flexible and better equipped before NATO entry . 
the defence ministry is considering substantial cuts in army personnel but the final decision will rest with the government . 
Folmer , ending his three-day visit , also reassured Poles that a planned agreement defining a new relationship between NATO and Russia would not be an obstacle to the alliance &apos;s eastern expansion . 
&quot; Poland has nothing to fear from the charter between Russia and NATO , &quot; he said .
