Short-covering propelled cash and futures JGBs higher by the close on Wednesday , breaking , though temporarily , a key chart resistance of 126.88 . 
&quot; The June JGB gathered ( upward ) momentum after breaching a key chart resistance at 126.88 , &quot; said a European bank trader . 
but its buoyancy was soon overwhelmed by speculative selling of 500 contracts that emerged near 127 , traders said . 
the bull mood in the market was supported by postponement of jumbo corporate bond issues which have been inspiring fears in the market of being unable to sell them to end-investors . 
traders at underwriting brokerages said they were holding &quot; dead stocks &quot; or recently issued corporate bonds which were not being sold to investors . 
such dead stocks have been putting a lid on prices of both cash JGBs and their futures contracts as underwriters have been inclined to sell JGBs in a bid to hedge against the risk of holding left-over corporate bonds . 
the issuance of a jumbo 150 billion yen worth of bonds by Tokyo Electric Power Co , which had been scheduled to be launched this week , was carried over to next week . 
the key June finished the session at 126.76 , up from its 126.56 close on Tuesday . 
it had risen to a high of 127.02 some 15 minutes before the close . 
pricing for Tokyo Electric &apos;s bond would be &quot; investor-friendly &quot; , compared with the perception of the terms on the recently floated issues as &quot; issuer-friendly &quot; and unpopular among investors , a brokerage trader said . 
bonds issued recently by companies such as Chubu Electric Power Co Inc and Hokuriku Electric Power Co Inc have traded well below their issue prices in the secondary market , traders said . 
in early trade , there was a rumour that overseas speculative accounts were buying Euroyen contracts on TIFFE and unloading JGBs at the same time , some traders said . 
public funds were on the buy-side of the JGBs , traders said . 
the Bank of Japan , in a surprise move , left the money market with a 200 billion yen surplus in its regular 0020 GMT market operation . 
but this had little impact on JGBs .
