the rupee closed at 57.74 on Thursday . 
&quot; Early speculation pushed up the dollar but sellers came in after the rate moved over 57.80 , &quot; said a Standard Chartered Bank dealer . 
overnight call money rates were at 12.25 percent after opening at 13 percent , dealers said . 
&quot; There is no reason for money rates to go up because the market is well offered , &quot; said one dealer .
