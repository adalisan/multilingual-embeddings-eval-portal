Republican Bob Dole , in a surprise move , challenged President Bill Clinton on Wednesday night to agree to a third campaign debate before the Nov . 5 election . 
invite all the candidates and talk about the economy , &quot; Dole said . 
the Democratic president did not immediately respond to the offer . 
dole issued the challenge when a woman participant in the town hall debate said that many Americans were apathetic about politics or involved in third parties , and asked what could be done to unite the country politically . 
he and Clinton had previously agreed to two debates , with the San Diego encounter to be their final face-to-face clash . 
although Dole opposed letting Reform Party candidate Ross Perot take part in the two agreed debates , he said on Wednesday he would be willing to have the Texas billionaire take part if another debate were scheduled . 
in his closing statement , Dole returned to the challenge , saying , &quot; We should have more debates .
