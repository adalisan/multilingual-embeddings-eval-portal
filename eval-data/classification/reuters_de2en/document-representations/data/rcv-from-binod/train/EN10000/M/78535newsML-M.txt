grain traders said on Thursday Taiwan &apos;s FGEP corn buying group will return to the market for a 54,000-tonne shipment of U.S. corn after a disputed tender price with Agrex on September 24 . 
a tender for the disputed shipment was placed on September 24 and FGEP buyers had said it was awarded to the lowest bidder Agrex at 89 U.S. cents per tonne over December Chicago futures . 
but the supplier disputed the price and said the bid was 89.20 U.S. cents . 
the two sides refused to enter into a final contract . 
the disputed shipment would be slated for delivery from December 10-25 from U.S. Gulf or December 26 to January 9 from the Pacific Northwest , traders said . 
no retender date has been set , but traders said the group would try again early next week .
