Slovenia is a promising candidate for full membership in the European Union , European External Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek said on Thursday . 
&quot; If Slovenia continues this way ( on the current path of reforms ) , it certainly should belong to the frontrunners of the process of enlarging the EU , &quot; he told a news conference during a one-day visit to Ljubljana . 
he said a definite decision on the candidates for full membership could be expected at the end of the inter-governmental conference ( IGC ) in June 1997 , while negotiations with the most promising candidates could start in early 1998 . 
van de Broek said he expected Slovenia to continue reforms to bring its legal , economic and social systems in line with EU standards after its third multi-party general elections set for November 10 . 
&quot; If I listen well to all sides , the general feeling is that membership in the EU is a common objective , &quot; he said . 
Slovenia signed an association agreement with the EU in June and hopes for full membership by the year 2001 . 
the Union is Slovenia &apos;s main trading partner and accounts for about 70 percent of its total foreign trade . 
nine other former communist states -- Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Estonia , Lithuania , Latvia , Romania and Bulgaria -- have already signed EU association agreements and are seeking full membership .
