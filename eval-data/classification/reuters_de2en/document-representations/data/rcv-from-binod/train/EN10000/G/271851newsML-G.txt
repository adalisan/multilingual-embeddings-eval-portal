the Italian government on Saturday called a confidence vote to ram a bill through the Senate on funding public works projects for jubilee celebrations in Rome at the end of the century . 
environment Minister Edo Ronchi told the Senate that the cabinet was forced to call a confidence vote because the bill needed to be passed quickly and there was not enough time to address numerous amendments . 
the bill , which was approved by the lower house Chamber of Deputies on Friday , allocates 3.5 trillion lire ( $ 2.3 billion ) for public works projects to prepare the Italian capital for the end-of-the-century celebrations . 
the city of Rome and the Vatican are gearing up for a huge influx of visitors in the year 2000 , which Pope John Paul has declared a holy year , or jubilee . 
Ronchi said that because of &quot; the international importance &quot; of the jubilee and the numerous amendments &quot; which would not allow the bill to be approved by the scheduled deadline , the government calls a confidence vote &quot; . 
Senate speaker Nicola Mancino immediately called a meeting with party leaders to decide when to hold the vote , the latest of several confidence votes the government has used to push legislation through parliament .
