the Chinese yuan closed up at a three-month high of 8.2924 against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday from Tuesday &apos;s 8.2932 , supported by positive trade figures , traders said . 
China &apos;s official media reported today that its trade surplus was $ 10.29 billion in the first four months , compared with a deficit of $ 607 million in the same period last year . 
the weighted average price on Tuesday was 8.2928 . 
the news strengthened pro-yuan sentiment , pushing the yuan up further , traders said . 
&quot; The market believes that the increased trade surplus will cause more dollar selling and the yuan is expected to rise further , &quot; one dealer said . 
the yuan opened higher at 8.2925 and moved in a narrow range of 8.2923 / 8.2925 for most of the session , hitting an intraday high of 8.2921 and a low of 8.2930 . 
trading was not active with most done at 8.2924 , traders said . 
&quot; The trade surplus indicated China &apos;s export business has begun to recover , which may bring more demand for the yuan , &quot; said another trader . 
&quot; If there is no central bank intervention to depress the yuan , the local currency will continue to rise in the short term , &quot; he said . 
dealers said they expected the yuan to test the key 8.2920 resistance level on Thursday . 
the yuan closed down at 6.9740 from 6.9300 against 100 Japanese yen and lower at 1.0722 from 1.0717 against the Hong Kong dollar .
