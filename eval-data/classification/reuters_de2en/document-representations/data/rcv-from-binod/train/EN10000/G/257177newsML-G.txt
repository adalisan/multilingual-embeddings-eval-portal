gunmen shot dead a Shi &apos;ite Moslem activist and wounded two of his companions in the city of Multan , in Pakistan &apos;s central province of Punjab , on Saturday , police and hospital sources said . 
the gunmen , their faces masked by scarves , fired on three local leaders of the Shi &apos;ite Tehrik-i-Jafria Pakistan group with Kalashnikov assault rifles , killing one and badly wounding the others , the sources said . 
the three Shi &apos;ites were attacked after they had attended a marriage ceremony in the city &apos;s Lal Shah district . 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the killing , which appeared to be the latest in a vendetta between rival Sunni and Shi &apos;ite Moslem groups in Pakistan . 
at least seven people have been killed in the feud in southern Punjab in the past 12 days . 
Shi &apos;ite activists have in the past blamed such attacks on the militant Sunni Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan group . 
Sunni-Shi &apos;ite disputes over religious doctrine have often spilled into violence in Pakistan , where Shi &apos;ites make up about 15 percent of the predominantly Sunni population .
