CSCE world sugar futures ended slightly lower for the second day in a row Thursday , with the London white sugar market lower also . 
&quot; We &apos;re still correcting from the break to the upside Tuesday and there &apos;s lots of Brazilian sugar around with commercials well hedged given high open interest in the options of 205,000 lots , &quot; Refco analyst Ann Prendergast said . 
CSCE October sugar , which expires September 30 , ended down 0.11 cent at 12.01 cents , after slipping back below perceived support at 12.00 cents , to a session low at 11.95 cents . 
both markets continue to be dominated by traders rolling positions out of the expiring October contracts to forward months , analysts said . 
&quot; There was some rolling of long positions from October to March going on , pressuring the near month , but there &apos;s some scale down buying below 12.00 cents providing support , &quot; one broker said . 
back months ended higher , with the October / March spread narrowing to 0.33 cents from 0.48 cents Wednesday . 
October futures jumped to 18 month highs at 12.20 cents this week , mostly on fund buying on a breakout of a six week 11.40-12.00 cent a lb range . 
&quot; But with reports of excess production again in 1996-97 the likelihood of the market being able to rally much beyond present levels should be limited , since major buyers such as China are not likely to chase the market up , &quot; Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes said . 
in physical market news , the Egyptian company , Multi Trade , confirmed Thursday it bought 60,000 tonnes of raw sugar Tuesday , as rumored Wednesday . 
Egypt &apos;s state owned General Company for wholesale Trade also bought 13,000 tonnes of Brazilian white sugar at $ 374 a tonne C &amp; F for October / November delivery . 
in addition , Egypt &apos;s state owned Sugar and Integrated Industries Company said Thursday it was bringing forward the deadline for the September 17 tender for 25,000 tonnes of loose raws or packed whites to September 16 .
