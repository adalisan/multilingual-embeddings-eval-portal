Middlesbrough &apos;s Italian striker Fabrizio Ravanelli will not be leaving the club in the forseeable future , chief executive Keith Lamb insisted on Saturday . 
Ravanelli was quoted in Italian newspapers this week as saying he was looking forward to returning to Italy by the end of the season at the latest and that Middlesbrough , currently bottom of of the English premier league , would be relegated . 
but Lamb said : &quot; We have tried to tell him not to talk to the Italian press . 
I do understand that you can be misrepresented in the press . 
he &apos;s never said to us that he wants to leave , and therefore until he does tell us that I &apos;ve taken the reports as newspaper speculation . 
&quot; He is a very important member of the football club , he has a four-year contract and we expect him to honour that . 
lamb said midfielder Brazilian midfielder Emerson had also settled down after his autumn disappearing acts . 
he returned to Brazil several times and did not reappear in Middlesbrough on time . 
&quot; They &apos;ve both committed themselves 100 percent . 
they understand we &apos;re all responsible for our present league position and that we all have to pull together to get out of it . 
lamb said there was no threat to the position of manager Bryan Robson , whose task of keeping Middlesbrough up was not helped on Tuesday when the club had three points deducted for pulling out of a game against Blackburn in December . 
&quot; That &apos;s not a vote of confidence , I don &apos;t need to give him a vote of confidence , Bryan &apos;s a confident enough man . 
we have a strategy here and Bryan is an integral part of that . 
we have objectives , we &apos;ve had a short-term hiccup , but Bryan still figures very prominently in our plans . 
&quot; We &apos;re all in this together and we expect to be all together at the end of this period . 
Middlesbrough were attempting to end a run of three successive league defeats when they faced Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday .
