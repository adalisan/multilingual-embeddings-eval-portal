lumber prices jumped to the highest level in nearly three years Monday after Canada curtailed exports to the United States to comply with a trade agreement that took effect in April . 
prices for crude oil , cocoa and some grains fell , and the Knight Ridder commodity Research Bureau index of 17 futures lost 0.78 point to 236.52 . 
November lumber jumped $ 28.50 to $ 477.50 for 1,000 board feet at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , capping a rise of $ 65 , or 16 percent , since Wednesday . 
it was the highest since the nearby contract reached $ 488 for 1,000 board feet in December 1993 . 
traders cited reduced shipments of spruce from Canada after the Canadian government last week moved to control the flow of wood to the United States under the trade pact that took effect on April 1 . 
under the agreement , Canadian lumber shipments that exceed 14.7 billion board feet a year are subject to an export levy . 
quarterly shipments above preset levels can also trigger the tariff . 
Canada on Thursday suspended exports for two days due to the pace of shipments , which were running at 62 percent of the annual allowable quota as of October 30 . 
with mill shipments disrupted by the quotas , analysts said futures prices look set to rise as high as $ 500 for 1,000 board feet . 
the record high for CME lumber futures was $ 493.50 set in March 1993 . 
&quot; You are going to have to take the November futures to a level where the sawmill will want to take the risk to make delivery with a penalty , &quot; said curt Cunningham , president of Pacific futures Trading . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see anything standing in the way of an all time high , &quot; Cunningham said . 
oil prices closed mostly lower amid diminished worries about low supplies of heating oil and gasoline . 
December crude oil fell 24 cents to $ 22.79 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange . 
December heating oil fell 0.65 cent to 65.95 cents a gallon . 
but December gasoline rose 0.30 cent to 65 cents a gallon . 
a buildup in heating oil stocks the last two weeks in the United States and an extended ceasefire among warring Kurdish factions last week , easing Mideast tension , sparked a huge selloff by speculators last week that carried over to Monday . 
&quot; It appears the market is in a downward mode here . 
it looks like we &apos;ll get more weakness tomorrow , at least early in the session , &quot; said Tom Bentz , a trader at ING Derivatives . 
since peaking two weeks ago at a post-Gulf War high $ 26.10 a barrel , NYMEX crude has fallen about 13 percent . 
at the New York Coffee Cocoa and Sugar Exchange , cocoa prices hit seven-month lows as the supply outlook improved . 
December cocoa fell $ 20 to $ 1,325 per metric ton . 
Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes said cocoa processors enjoyed a healthy supply surplus for the 1995 / 1996 season just ended , and recent estimates have called for a smaller-than-expected deficit for the 1996 / 97 crop year . 
&quot; The result of the two years is going to be a net ( supply ) gain , &quot; Ganes said . 
&quot; So why should we rally ? 
elsewhere , December corn futures fell 1-1 / 4 cents to $ 2.61-3 / 4 a bushel at the Chicago Board of Trade , after farmers stepped up harvesting over the weekend . 
November soybeans rose 2-3 / 4 cents to $ 6.66 a bushel , with traders citing purchases of soymeal by commercial grain companies as supporting overall demand for soybeans .
