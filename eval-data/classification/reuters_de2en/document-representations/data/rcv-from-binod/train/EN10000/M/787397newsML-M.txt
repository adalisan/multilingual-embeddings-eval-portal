the Kenyan shilling strengthened marginally against the dollar on Friday as dollars were sold in profit-taking a day after the shilling slumped to a record low . 
at the close of business , the shilling was posted at a commercial average of 69.02 against the dollar compared with its opening rate of 70.26 -- a total gain of 1.76 percent . 
commercial bank dealers said it was too early to declare an end to the shilling &apos;s slide since the IMF halted a key loan package last week . 
but they added that the market had also been slightly calmed by positive signals from the finance ministry . 
in a bid to calm the turbulent market on Thursday , Finance minister Musalia Mudavadi said the government was considering talks with the IMF on securing a second year of the three-year loan package and pledged government commitment to reforms . 
the pressure has eased , &quot; said a dealer from a leading commercial bank . 
dealers said demand from foreign investors who had flooded the market to offload dollars had thinned and other investors had kept off the market because of a national strike called by an opposition-backed coalition pressing for political reforms . 
most dealers said they believed the shilling had reached its lowest and was expected to make further gains next week because many speculators and exporters were long on dollars and were likely to flood the market with dollars . 
&quot; I don &apos;t believe the shilling can support itself at 70 , &quot; a chief dealer at a top commercial bank told Reuters . 
earlier , one dealer said : &quot; The market is very thin today because most people did not turn up to trade . 
&quot; People are now selling dollars because they &apos;ve seen there is very little business . 
most of them were in long dollar positions , &quot; a senior dealer told Reuters . 
the movement on Friday brought the shilling &apos;s total loss against the dollar since news of the IMF decision to 16 percent compared with a 18.08 percent loss at Thursday &apos;s close after the shilling sunk to a new official record low of 70.26 . 
the centre of Nairobi was calm on Friday but many shops and offices were closed because of fears of violence during the one-day national strike called by some opposition leaders . 
the International Monetary Fund gave a cold reception to Mudavadi &apos;s comments , saying that Kenya must move against corruption before any talks to revive the IMF loan halted on Thursday last week . 
President Daniel arap Moi told a rally in central Kenya on Friday that his government was committed to eradicating corruption in the country and added that all those involved would be fully investigated . 
&quot; The president however said that in order to eradicate corruption fully but there was need for all Kenyans to join in the fight against it , &quot; state KBC radio quoted Moi as saying .
