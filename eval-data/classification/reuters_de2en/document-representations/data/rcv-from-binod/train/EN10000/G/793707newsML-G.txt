Mexico &apos;s Popocatepetl volcano on Tuesday released its greatest ash cloud since late June , when it blanketed Mexico City with ash and forced closure of the airport . 
ash flew more than a mile ( about 2 km ) into the sky on Tuesday at 8 : 24 a.m. ( 1324 GMT ) , with strong winds blowing particles southwest over the states of Morelos and Mexico , chief volcano monitor Roberto Quaas told Reuters . 
should winds change direction , ash could billow toward Mexico City , he added . 
the majestic , snow-capped volcano is 33 miles ( 50 km ) southeast of the capital . 
this latest blast may be a sign of more rumblings from the 17,719-foot ( 5,452-metre ) volcano , affectionately known as &quot; Popo . 
&quot; We think that in coming days there will be more frequent exhalations of this intensity , but it is no reason for alarm , &quot; Quaas said . 
he said Tuesday &apos;s column of ash was the largest since the June 30 explosion that sent particles falling across Central Mexico and forced the Mexico City airport to shut . 
there were no plans for evacuations this time , he added .
