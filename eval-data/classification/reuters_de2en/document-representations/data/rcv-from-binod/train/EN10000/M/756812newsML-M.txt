the New Zealand dollar closed a turbulent week firmer and in reasonable spirits , despite drifting off from its intra-session highs . 
dealers expected further volatility from the currency , but said its recovery from a low on Tuesday of US $ 0.6450 to its close on Friday at 0.6546 / 53 , up from 0.6538 / 45 at the open , had improved general sentiment . 
&quot; The kiwi &apos;s very volatile at the moment . 
we &apos;ve had some big ranges -- it &apos;s up and down like a yo-yo , &quot; said a bank chief dealer . 
&quot; But I think overall it looks okay at the moment , particularly with no rate cut in Australia today and the Aussie holding here nicely above US $ 0.7390 . 
&quot; I would expect that the kiwi will remain volatile again tonight , but I think the downside should be limited to around 0.6525 , with a move closer towards 0.6575 in the offing . 
the New Zealand currency traded as high as 0.6565 this session but eased off towards the close . 
&quot; I think the local trading market was probably a little long looking for a retry of the overnight highs and they just got filled in and it &apos;s drifted off , &quot; said the chief dealer at another bank . 
&quot; But the volumes have been quite light . 
I would suggest that the general feeling is probably a little more upbeat , a bit more positive , given that kiwi &apos;s managed to recover nicely from its lows and really is closing pretty well bid , &quot; he said . 
but the longer term trend , which has seen the kiwi fall from above 67.7 U.S. cents in a month , was still in place . 
&quot; We &apos;re just marking time and consolidating , because we saw some pretty considerable losses over a very short period of time , &quot; said a dealer . 
the Trade-Weighted Index closed unchanged at 65.07 .
