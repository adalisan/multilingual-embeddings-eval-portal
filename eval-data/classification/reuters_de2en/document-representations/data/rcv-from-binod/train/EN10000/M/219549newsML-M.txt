the North Sea wet Brent market held onto early gains on Wednesday after a strong morning deal was followed up by others at the same level . 
a Dec 11-13 Brent traded early between refiners at Jan Brent + 30 cents , 20 cents up on Tuesday &apos;s traded level . 
confirming the hike in prices , a 10-12 loader was traded at Jan + 30 cents and resold at a 33 cent premium . 
a Dec 11-13 was traded at Jan Brent + 35 cents , while a 7-9 cargo changed hands at a dated related price . 
&quot; There was talk that the market was being pushed around , but it &apos;s pretty clear that the demand is there , &quot; a trader said . 
healthy buying interest was seen not only from local refiners , but also from the Mediterranean , traders said . 
the Dec / Jan spread was talked at + 66 / 75 cents late in the day , while Jan / Feb was discussed slightly softer at + 54 / 61 and Feb / March at + 53 / 56 . 
despite an apparently booming Brent market , the two Brent dates turning wet today were both clocked . 
Suko was clocked with one of the Dec 12-14 loaders by Cargill , while Nova was clocked with another by Morgan Stanley . 
brisk buying was also seen for other North Sea grades which are now mostly sold out until the third decade of December . 
an end-Dec Norwegian Statfjord traded at a p + c price , while a Danish DUC , loading Dec 26-28 , changed hands at a firmer dated Brent + 12 cent 
the West African crude market was looking tidy in the short term , traders said , with most early December cargoes placed .
