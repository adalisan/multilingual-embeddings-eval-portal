once bitter rivals , Ahmad Shah Masood , the former Afghan government &apos;s military chief , and northern Uzbek leader Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum have finally allied to face the Taleban militia . 
Masood wants to dislodge the Taleban from Kabul after the radical Islamic militia took control of the Afghan capital last month , making two-thirds of the country theirs . 
to do the job , Masood needs Dostum &apos;s army , the strongest force out of Afghanistan &apos;s tangle of armed factions . 
but Dostum has been reluctant to ally with his former foe and even now his backing for Masood &apos;s counter-offensive appears tentative . 
in Jabal Os-Siraj , a town 45 km ( 30 miles ) north of the Afghan capital , where Masood is headquartered , hundreds of troops belonging to Dostum &apos;s Jumbish-i-Milli faction are billeted on the floors of dingy hotels and run-down restaurants . 
while most Afghan fighters sport straggly beards , Dostum &apos;s Uzbek fighters are instantly recognisable by their thick moustaches , closely shaved chins and blue-chequered turbans over neat , Soviet issue combat dress . 
the Jumbish have a plentiful array of armour , artillery and a small air force and Dostum &apos;s forces played a major role in Tuesday &apos;s offensive against Taleban forces north of Kabul . 
&quot; For the first time , Dostum &apos;s troops were fully integrated alongside our troops , we fought fifty-fifty , &quot; said Mehrabodin Masstan , a spokesman for Masood . 
but the wily Dostum , who jealously guards his hold over six northern provinces in Afghanistan , has appeared less than committed to his erstwhile foe , keeping quiet about his alliance with Masood . 
he agreed a defensive alliance with Masood earlier this month after the Taleban advanced north towards his territory , but suddenly held peace talks with the Taleban only two days after recognising the ousted government &apos;s legitimacy . 
in a tour of the front this week , Dostum &apos;s top commander , General Abdul Majid Ruzi , would only say of his mens &apos; obvious presence : &quot; They ( Jumbish troops ) do not belong to us . 
&quot; Admittedly , he said it with a large grin . 
Dostum also made a last ditch attempt at forging a ceasefire on Sunday . 
the Taleban are now under no illusion they face the Jumbish in their battle to hold onto Kabul . 
the Afghan Islamic Press quoted acting Taleban Information Minister Amir Khan Mutaqi saying that Dostum &apos;s forces &quot; have openly taken part in the offensives &quot; against Taleban north of Kabul . 
heavy fighting continued for several hours north of the capital on Thursday , where a Masood offensive has failed to win control of a strategic pass , before a lull set in . 
the decision to back Masood cannot have come easy to Dostum as the two men fought hard for control of the strategic Salang highway in 1994 . 
Dostum was a commander in the Soviet-backed Afghan army while Masood shot to fame as probably the ablest Mujahedin commander in the Afghan resistance to the Soviet invasion . 
but their fear of an Afghanistan under the complete control of the Taleban has proved stronger than their differences . 
&quot; The Pakistanis tried hard to drive a wedge between Dostum and Masood , &quot; said a Western aid worker who knows Masood well . 
she said the Pakistani government , widely seen as the main backer of the Taleban movement , had tried to tempt Dostum with a share of potentially lucrative trade between Pakistan and the former Soviet republics of Central Asia to the north . 
but Dostum cannot have failed to notice how the Taleban have quickly forgotten power-sharing arrangements with other warlords in their dramatic sweep northwards since the militia was founded in 1994 . 
&quot; Dostum would be cutting his own throat if he threw in his lot with the Taleban , &quot; said a western observer in Afghanistan . 
the Taleban &apos;s radical brand of Islam is wholly unwelcome in the more liberal north and fear of the Taleban as a mainly ethnic Pashtun movement from the south worries Dostum &apos;s ethnic Uzbeks and Masood &apos;s ethnic Tajiks from the north .
