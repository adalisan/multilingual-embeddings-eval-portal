St. Petersburg , Fla . , Mayor David Fischer proposed bond financing for $ 8.2 million of upgrades to the Devil rays &apos; spring training facilities , St. Petersburg Times reported Thursday . 
the major league baseball team leases three city-owned faciliites -- Al Lang Stadium , the Cardinals Complex and Huggins-Stengel Field . 
under Fischer &apos;s proposal , the Devil rays would take over the facilities and pay up to $ 800,000 a year in operating costs .
