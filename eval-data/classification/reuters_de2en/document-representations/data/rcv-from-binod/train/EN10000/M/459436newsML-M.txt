the dollar fell on Friday after comments by a top Federal Reserve official raised concerns that the United States may not tolerate a further appreciation of the currency . 
the dollar slumped after a wire service reported that Fed Vice Chairwoman Alice Rivlin said the administration did not want to see excessive strength in the dollar . 
the report said that Rivlin , in a speech on Thursday in Nebraska , said U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin had set limits on his strong dollar policy . 
the Fed denied the report . 
Rubin has not wavered in his backing of a strong dollar , despite growing complaints from U.S. exporters whose profits and competitiveness have diminished as a result of the dollar &apos;s recent strength . 
&quot; These kinds of comments are not characteristic . 
the dollar immediately blipped down . 
the comments came from the Fed , not from the administration , and the market takes that quite seriously , &quot; said John Nelson , foreign exchange trading manager at ABN AMRO bank . 
in the United States , the dollar slid to 1.6853 German marks in late trading from 1.6930 marks late Thusday . 
the dollar fell to 122.85 Japanese yen from 123.73 yen . 
the comments led investors to question the dollar &apos;s upside potential , despite hopes for higher U.S. interest rates . 
the dollar had rallied on Thursday as market players , encouraged by comments made by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan , bet that short-term interest rates would be raised at a key policy meeting on Tuesday . 
even before the report of Rivlin &apos;s comments sent the dollar lower on Friday , the currency weakened after U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshevky warned Japan against trying to export its way out of recesssion . 
&quot; Barshevsky said she was not too pleased with the export-led recovery in Japan and would rather see a recovery led by domestic growth , &quot; said Lisa Finstrom , a Smith Barney currency analyst . 
her comments reignited questions about whether the dollar &apos;s strong gains against the yen may be slowing . 
the greenback has risen about 6 percent against the yen since the beginning of the year and by over 50 percent from its lows in early 1995 . 
in other trading Friday , the British pound edged up to $ 1.6052 from $ 1.5940 . 
the dollar closed higher against the Swiss franc at 1.4575 vs. 1.4535 late Thursday .
