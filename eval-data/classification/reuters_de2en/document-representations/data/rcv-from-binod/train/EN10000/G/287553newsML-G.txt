the Sudan opposition Umma party said on Sunday that police used gunfire to disperse Saturday demonstrations in Khartoum in which people chanted for the downfall of the Islamist-backed government and a return to democracy . 
the statement , which could not be independently verified , also said six Umma members had been arrested in the past few days and appealed to human rights organisations to work to guarantee their safety . 
it said demonstrations broke out in several places on Saturday night in Khartoum . 
it did not say how large the demonstrations were or if anyone was injured . 
the Umma party leader , Sadeq al-Mahdi , arrived in Egypt in late December on a tour including countries in Asia and Europe to muster support for the opposition . 
he said in Cairo on Friday that a popular uprising was most likely to overthrow the government in Khartoum , rather than a military campaign from abroad or a coup d &apos;etat . 
Mahdi fled Khartoum last month saying he wanted to change the Khartoum government . 
he was Sudanese prime minister when Lt-General Omar Hassan Al-Bashir , now the country &apos;s president , seized power in a bloodless coup in 1989 .
