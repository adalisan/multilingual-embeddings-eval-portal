emerging Market debt prices soared on the back of U.S. treasuries . 
Short-covering of leveraged positions acclerated the takeoff , traders said . 
the uninterrupted rally of Latin debts this week pushed some call options in the money , which obliged naked call writers to seek cover in the cash market , they said . 
leveraged deals are heavily concentrated in Argentina FRBs , and Brazil C because of the size of the underlying and the relative simplicity in the absence of collaterals , they said . 
setting new year-to-date highs , Argie FRB zoomed through several big rounded numbers at 80 , 81 and 82 , ending at 82.00 even bid , up 1 / 8 . 
&quot; There &apos;s very heavy covering in Argie , &quot; said a broker . 
&quot; It is believed that it comes from leveraged plays . 
hedge funds , among the players , have anted up through leveraged deals , he said . 
once there are leverage instruments involved in the market , some of the buying and selling are not just motivated by directional bets , said a Brady trader in a U.S. investment house . 
&quot; There is money to be made in just delta-hedging . 
as the FRB penetrated above 80 , many players wrote covered calls to lock in profits , hence pushing premiums sharply lower without disturbing the cash market , the broker said . 
the rise in cash price and the decline in options premiums recall the market peak just before the peso crisis in late 1994 , said the broker . 
at these levels , the implied volatilities could explode , if the cash market suddenly reverses direction , traders said . 
Venezuela put on a solid performance on the back of its 650 million DM-denominated seven year bond , at 440 basis points over the comparable Bund . 
&quot; It is tightly priced , &quot; said Walter Molano , Latin America economist at SBC / Warburg , noting that the launch was shrewdly timed to take advantage of the currently higher oil prices . 
Venezuela pars jumped 1-5 / 8 to 67-5 / 8 , DCBs rose 7 / 8 to 80-5 / 8 and FLIRBs added 1.00 to 81-3 / 4 .
