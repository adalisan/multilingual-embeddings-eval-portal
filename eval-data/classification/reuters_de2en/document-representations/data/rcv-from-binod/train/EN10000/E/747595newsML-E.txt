China is likely to keep bank interest rates at current levels for the foreseeable future , despite low inflation , mainly because of a slowdown in savings , banking analysts said on Tuesday . 
the central bank could instead prefer to cut bank reserve ratios as an alternative way of offsetting the impact of falling inflation , the analysts said . 
falls in retail price inflation to a year-on-year 6.1 percent in mid-1996 from record highs of 21 percent in 1994 led to two interest rate cuts in May and August last year . 
inflation had fallen to an official year-on-year 1.8 percent in the first half of 1997 and there had been hopes of another interest rate cut , analysts said . 
but slower bank deposit growth made this highly unlikely , a banker with a major Chinese state bank said . 
&quot; As all Chinese banks are state owned , most industrial firms still rely on bank loans , instead of raising money through the market , &quot; another banking source said . 
&quot; This reliance means the central bank cannot cut interest rates without considering the impact this would have on bank deposits , &quot; he said . 
figures from the central bank show that individual bank deposits grew 19.65 percent in the first half of 1997 , compared with an increase of 37.7 percent for all of 1996 , the Financial News said on Tuesday . 
last year &apos;s two cuts brought interest rates down by 2.48 percentage points on average , with the rate for one-year bank deposits now at 7.47 percent from 9.15 percent in May 1996 . 
Bank interest rates were now the lowest since 1990 , analysts said . 
recent monthly surveys by the central bank of bank account holders have found that 34.5 percent of respondents prefer to put their money in long-term fixed deposits , official media have reported . 
this figure was down by 4.5 percentage points compared with the year-ago period , reports said . 
&quot; Even if the macro-economy improves further , the central bank may use the chance to adjust the whole banking system and a bank reserve ratio cut is more likely to come before an interest rate cut , &quot; the first banker said . 
Beijing now asks banks to put aside 13 percent of their deposits for central reserves and another five to seven percent for their own reserves . 
these ratios had not changed for nine years and lagged far behind economic development , analysts said . 
the ratio cut , promised by the central bank in July 1996 , has yet to be implemented partly because the surging stock markets had made authorities nervous about allowing more cash into the system , analysts said . 
bankers said they had no idea when ratios would be cut and cited a number of likely reasons , including rampant share speculation , for the delay . 
&quot; The central bank will not cut the bank interest rates in the short term for fear of fanning stock speculation again , &quot; a stock analyst with a major Chinese brokerage said . 
other factors included slow sales of state debt this year because of the debt &apos;s falling coupons after the 1996 rate cuts , analysts said . 
China has said it plans to issue a record of around 250 billion yuan in state debt this year to cover state deficits and redeem maturing debt .
