troops loyal to Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov used artillery and rockets against positions held by a mutinous government commander south of Dushanbe on Monday . 
near the village of leur , about 18 km ( 12 miles ) south of the Tajik capital , a Reuter correspondent saw puffs of smoke lift off the crest of a mountain as Rakhmonov &apos;s presidential guard fired shells and rockets every few minutes on forces belonging to maverick colonel Makhmud Khudoyberdyev . 
fighting in Dushanbe itself died down on Sunday after forces belonging to Tajik interior ministry commander Sukhrob Kasimov seized a northern district from a rival warlord . 
civilians and private transport were back on the streets on Monday . 
but Khudoberdyev , the commander of an elite government armoured brigade in the south of the former Soviet republic , seized upon unrest in Dushanbe on Saturday to advance his own , as yet unclear , political ambitions . 
&quot; It was quiet overnight , but we started fighting at about 8.30 am ( 0330 GMT ) , &quot; said a tired-looking commander in charge of a ragged collection of soldiers in leur . 
fighting comes only weeks after Rakhmonov signed a peace agreement with armed Islamic opposition guerrillas aimed at ending a four-year civil war in the country which borders Afghanistan .
