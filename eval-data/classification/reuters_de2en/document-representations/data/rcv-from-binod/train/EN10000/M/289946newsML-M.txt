the Philippine Central Bank said on Monday it lowered its borrowing rates on special series Treasury bills to 11.30 percent from 11.40 percent . 
it currently offers T-bills with terms of 65 and 72 days . 
a dealer said the Central Bank trended rates in line with the current rates in the secondary market for T-bills . 
banks expect interest rates to fall in view of the one percentage-point cut in reserve requirements which took effect last Friday which would have released some 6.7 billion pesos from the Central Bank &apos;s vaults .
