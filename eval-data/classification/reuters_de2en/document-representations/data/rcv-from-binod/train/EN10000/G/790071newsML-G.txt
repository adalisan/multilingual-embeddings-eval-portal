hundreds of Greek Cypriots attended on Sunday a memorial service for two youths killed by Turkish Cypriots during clashes last year along the ceasefire line dividing the island in two . 
Greek Cypriots Tasos Isaak , 24 , and Solakis Solomou , 26 , were killed on August 11 and 14 respectively last year . 
Isaak was killed during a rally organised by local motorcyclists called to protest the continuing division of the island . 
he was beaten to death by people from the Turkish half of the island . 
three days later , after his emotionally charged funeral , Solomou was shot dead as he attempted to climb a flagpole and tear down the Turkish flag . 
at Paralimni village , some 100 kms ( 60 miles ) south east of the capital Nicosia , stony faced relatives gave out bread blessed by a priest and grain and raisins as is the Greek Orthodox custom after the memorial service . 
dozens of riot police stood guard close to the ceasefire line where the two youths were killed last year . 
Solomou &apos;s father was refused entry by police into the buffer zone to lay a wreath where his son was killed . 
&quot; We took all precautions necessary , &quot; said Justice Minister Nicos Koshis . 
their deaths heightened tension on the island , divided after a Turkish invasion in 1974 in response to a Greek-inspired coup , to levels unprecedented since 1974 . 
on Monday Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash are due to start a second round of formal U.N. sponsored talks at Montreux .
