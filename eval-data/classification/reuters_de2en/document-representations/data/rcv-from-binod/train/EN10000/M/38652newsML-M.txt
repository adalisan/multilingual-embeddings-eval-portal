wheat futures traded steady on the Sydney futures Exchange on Friday as the prospect of big wheat crops throughout the world dominated the market focus . 
the January contract traded steady on A $ 183.50 , with six lots changing hands . 
&quot; ( There are ) worries that in January and February the world &apos;s going to be awash with wheat , &quot; Phil Lindsay of ord Minnett Jardine Fleming futures Ltd said . 
January and February would be at the height of the 1996 / 97 Australian harvest of a crop that Australian Wheat forecasters Pty Ltd on Thursday forecast at a near-record 19.8 million tonnes . 
&quot; There &apos;s certainly a lot more grower interest in selling at the moment than there has been , &quot; he said . 
&quot; You may see ( some ) more aggressive selling as next week progresses , &quot; he said . 
growers seemed to be selling on the forward cash markets and buying call options , he said .
