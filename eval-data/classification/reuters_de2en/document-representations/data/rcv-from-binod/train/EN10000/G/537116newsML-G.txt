a Turkish state security court has charged a top musician and human rights activist with giving false passports to two former Kurdish guerrillas , the media said on Thursday . 
the court in Istanbul refused to comment on the charge , but the Turkish daily Cumhuriyet said Sanar Yurdatapan was accused of &quot; aiding an illegal group &quot; . 
police detained him at Istanbul airport at the weekend on returning from Germany with two false passports prepared for former Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) members , the Turkish media reported . 
&quot; My brother Sanar Yudatapan was arrested on April 22 , but I was not informed under what accusation , &quot; Onur Yurdatapan told Reuters . 
Yurdatapan , one of the country &apos;s most famous popular music composers , is a human rights activist who has often criticised the treatment of Turkey &apos;s Kurdish minority . 
more than 22,000 people have been killed in the 12-year conflict between security forces and the PKK , fighting for autonomy or independence in the mainly-Kurdish southeast .
