NWE high sulphur fuel oil barges were steady on Tuesday , traders said . 
high sulphur barges traded at $ 86.50 a tonne fob Ara for stored material but refinery barrels were subsequently sold for $ 88 , traders said . 
high sulphur cargoes were broadly steady and thin although differing qualities were heard under discussion . 
lower quality material was pegged close to $ 84 CIF NWE , while better quality pieces were assessed around three dollars above that . 
low sulphur cargo markets were flat to firmer , and dealers said they only saw one prompt offer of material . 
this was available out of Germany , they said , but the offer price on Tuesday morning was not known . 
low sulphur straight-run fuel was slightly firmer in line with futures . 
while six NWE-origin pieces were thought available between August 10 and 15 , nothing was thought on offer ahead of that time . 
at least one player , an Ara refiner , was heard seeking prompt product and was bidding at around $ 102 on a fob basis late on Monday .
