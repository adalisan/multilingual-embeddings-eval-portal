South African gold shares ended firmer on the back of a brighter bullion price , fixed in London this morning at a one-month high of $ 348.20 an ounce , dealers said . 
they said the yellow metal &apos;s steady recovery since late last week had also been helped by some weakness in the U.S. currency . 
the gold index finished up 30.3 points at 1,267.9 , while the industrial index was down 25.1 points at 8,476.1 , and the all-share gained 6.5 points to close at 7,185.9 . 
dealers said market volumes were moderate with 583 million rand worth of shares exchanging hands by the close of trade . 
they said Tuesday &apos;s trading session was expected to be unchanged with market players eyeing Wall Street and some local economic data for further direction during the week . 
the local March year-on-year producer price inflation figure is scheduled for release on Thursday . 
dealers said industrials were disappointed by Wall Street &apos;s gains on Friday and finished weaker on the back of some profit-taking and a disappointing start in results reporting by one of the industrial giants among several scheduled to release their results this week . 
packaging group Nampak Ltd raised its first half headline earnings by eight percent and its attributable earnings climbed to 55.9 cents per share from 52.2 cents previously . 
dealers , however , said the overall market &apos;s underlying sentiment remained positive .
