June gilt futures traded on LIFFE were set to hold in a sideways range on Monday after seeing a break below 113-28 on Friday , a low from May 15 , technical analysts said . 
analysts said there was likely to be some limited follow-through to this weakness in the near-term before the June contract could attempt a further push higher . 
&quot; We are probably going to trade in a sideways range between 113-29 the figure , to 113-16 . 
I &apos;d expect it to come lower sometime over the next couple of days and make a base fairly strongly , &quot; said David Wood , an independent technical analyst . 
June gilt futures closed at 113-25 on Friday . 
&quot; Today it will look weak while trading below 113-27,29 and it will look pretty good again if it can get back above 114-06 , &quot; Wood said , pegging these as principle levels to watch on Monday . 
he said the market was likely to be fairly quiet due to holidays in many European financial centres and this could restrict any downside coming through until Tuesday . 
Steve Hutt , technical analyst at NatWest said from a technical viewpoint the market was looking bearish all round and should be heading back towards a low of 112-28 . 
&quot; The daily slow stochastic is certainly giving a fairly strong sell signal and the RSI has also turned and is starting to give a sell signal as well , &quot; Hutt said . 
the market touched a low of 112-28 on May 8 and Wood also placed the next clear chart support levels at 112-28,25 . 
he put near-term support at around 113-06,04 which he said was more achievable . 
at the short end , September short sterling futures were down one basis point at 93.23 .
