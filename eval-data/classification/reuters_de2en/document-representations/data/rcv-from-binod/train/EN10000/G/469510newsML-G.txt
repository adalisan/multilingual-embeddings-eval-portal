remember that kid in your class with the uncool haircut and the pocket protector tucked into his white shirt who always had a pen or pencil handy ? 
today your old classmate could be writing with something more valuable than a chewed No . 
2 pencil . 
today , many pencils and pens are valuable collectibles . 
collectible mechanical pencils can cost $ 35 to $ 150 depending on their age , condition and materials , according to Max Davis , owner of Davis Vintage Collectibles in New York City . 
a mechanical pencil can be made of red rubber , plastic , gold , sterling silver , a combination of metals or mother of pearl . 
sets are more difficult to come by and may command a higher price . 
Davis said of the collectors who browse his vintage selection , about 10 percent of them are looking for pen and pencil sets , 20 percent are &quot; accountants who are looking for long , beautiful pencils , &quot; and the rest are pen collectors . 
writing utensils have fascinated for generations . 
there were great pencils in history . 
Abe Lincoln used one to write the Gettysburg Address , Beethoven &apos;s musical notebooks were kept in pencil and in 1965 , a collector paid $ 100 for a dozen pencils from Henry David Thoreau &apos;s desk . 
Marc Ames of Bridgewater , N.J. , started out collecting pencils , moved on to pens and says he has over 1,000 in his combined collection . 
&quot; They ( pens ) fascinated me . 
the first fountain pen I had was a Wearever for $ 1.25 with a gold nib , &quot; Ames told Reuters . 
he said pens and pencils with political messages are &quot; double collectibles &quot; because they are also wanted by political memorabilia collectors . 
&quot; Most people are looking for a bit of nostalgia these days , &quot; he said , describing what sparks interest in the marketplace . 
Pen and pencil enthusiast Cliff Lawrence has been monitoring the hobby &apos;s habits since 1978 when he started The Pen fancier &apos;s Magazine ( it was renamed the Pen Trading Post in 1993 ) . 
speaking from his Dunedin , Fla . , home , he gets a bit out of breath describing the great pens from years gone by . 
&quot; In the 1940s and 1950s , fountain pens were a big thing . 
every man had one in his pocket and a woman carried one in her purse , &quot; he said . 
the most expensive pen ever sold was a 1907 Waterman snake pen that went for $ 40,000 . 
it is eye-catching because it has a snake with green , glass eyes on the tapered cap and the ink was filled with an eye dropper , Lawrence said . 
&quot; Snake motifs were popular back then in decorating , &quot; he said , adding that unique trim can make an item more valuable . 
Lawrence said the most valuable pens should be in working order with original parts , but collectors will not be so picky about the condition of certain rare pens . 
some that he put high on the want-list include the rare , Red Giant Parker Co. pen that was made from 1907-1912 . 
it is a huge , red pen with a large nib and Lawrence said he recently sold one for just under $ 4,000 . 
a Black Giant Parker , made between 1907 and 1918 and in good shape may be valued at about $ 2,200 . 
the No.20 pens by Waterman -- a black , red or ripple-coloured instrument -- are considered very valuable with the red one carrying a price tag of about $ 10,000 . 
the black one can command $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 but the red and black ripple-coloured pen may set you back a whopping $ 20,000 because there are only one or two known to still exist . 
collectible pens were generally made in the United States and experts agree the quality was very good , even in the 19th century . 
most of the early pens came from the Waterman Pen Co. and the Parker Pen Co . from the turn of the century to around 1920 , however , there were many pen companies offering a variety of styles including a pen / pencil in one . 
the 1930s were the &quot; gimmick era &quot; of pens when the fad was to have see-through barrels -- presumably so money would not be spent needlessly during the Depression on ink before the pen was empty . 
collecting pens didn &apos;t really catch on until the 1980s , an expert said . 
some pen fanciers , who bought high-quality pens in the 1970s for as little as 25 cents , were able to sell them for hundreds of dollars when interest picked up . 
&quot; One big handicap of vintage pens is the limited supply , &quot; Lawrence said , adding that the best place to find them may simply be &quot; the luck of the draw ... a chance stop at a flea market , estate sale or maybe an auction . 
he said pen collecting reached its peak around 1990 with an influx of overseas customers . 
after that , it slowed , but seems to be picking up again . 
Davis said he does not see many young collectors but insists , &quot; Pens are going up in value every year and are a good investment because they &apos;re easy to handle and to store . 
the American pencil collector Society boasts 300 members -- including one in North Dakota who claims to have more than 25,000 pencils , but no pocket protector .
