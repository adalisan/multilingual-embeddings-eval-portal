Dutch bonds steadily recouped initial losses on Monday to end slightly higher as the long-term uptrend continued , traders said . 
&quot; In the longer term , we are expecting a climb , particularly at the long end ( of the curve ) , &quot; one trader said . 
longer dated paper did indeed gain most . 
however , thin volumes and the lack of U.S. players left a number of traders regarding the gains as inconclusive . 
&quot; It just shows that if they &apos;re not there , it &apos;s just a disaster , &quot; one trader said . 
in a low-key day , traded volume of 1999 paper was at least respectable in the morning . 
traders said some players were encouraged to buy at the mild dip . 
some players also took an interest in medium-dated paper , with maturities from 2000 to 2002 , from mid-session , traders said . 
spreads under German bunds remained virtually unchanged after initial underperformance of Dutch bonds .
