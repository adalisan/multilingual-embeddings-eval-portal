Italy &apos;s Alessandro Zanardi cemented his third CART pole this year amd 10th overall Saturday with an intimidating lap in the closing seconds of qualifying for Sunday &apos;s Cleveland Grand Prix . 
Zanardi , driving a Reynard Honda , won the provisional pole on Friday , then failed to improve his time around the 10-turn , Burke Lakefront Airport until the final lap when he tore off a record lap of 56.984 seconds for an average speed of 133.048 mph ( 14.114 kph ) , more than a half of a second faster than the similar car of Brazilian Gil de Ferran . 
third fastest and coming off his win at the last race , at Portland , Oregon , was Briton Mark Blundell in a Reynard Mercedes-Benz at 57.538 . 
Michael Andretti , winner of the opening round at Homestead was fourth at 57.637 seconds in a Swift Ford . 
watching his rivals improve their times but fail to surpass his , Zanardi said his team wasn &apos;t certain of holding onto the pole . 
&quot; We knew if we wanted to stay on pole we would have to go a little faster &quot; . 
he knew his car was still faster than his competition but his problem was getting around the slower cars . 
&quot; It was a matter of getting a clear lap , which wasn &apos;t until the last lap . 
I was lucky to cross the start finish line with one second left ( in the session ) and there was no one in front of me , &quot; said Zanardi . 
DeFerran , last year &apos;s winner here , wasn &apos;t worried about the big difference between his time and Zanardi &apos;s . 
&quot; It &apos;s been a tough weekend . 
the car &apos;s been nervous . 
we made some changes and the car was greatly improved , &quot; he said . 
twenty-eight drivers are scheduled to start the 90-lap race on Sunday , the tenth event in the 17 race series .
