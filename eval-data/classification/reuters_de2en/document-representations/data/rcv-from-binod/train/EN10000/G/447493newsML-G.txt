the European Union &apos;s planned single currency is child &apos;s play . 
to prove it a group of 208 primary school children aged between five and 10 have produced a 15-minute video to demonstrate the ins and outs of the project . 
under the guidance of their teachers the children drew their houses , pets and toys to show what is their &apos;s and someone else &apos;s , then negotiated values and prices for them . 
that proved tricky , but the trouble really started when different classes in Brussels &apos; Nos enfants school set up different currencies -- shells to marbles to stickers -- and started to worry about exchange rates for buying orange juice . 
so they settled on a &quot; We kids &quot; single currency and all was well . 
&quot; Our teachers tell us we &apos;ve done the same as Europe , &quot; one kid said in the video . 
the EU &apos;s Consumer Affairs Commissioner Emma Bonino told the children they had explained how the the EU currency plan would affect the ordinary man and woman better than the German central bank chief Hans Tietmeyer had ever done . 
&quot; Uou have done it in an easy way , better than Tietmeyer . 
maybe you have not yet come across Tietmeyer . 
he &apos;s a big man , very powerful who every day explains to us the parameters of Maastricht , &quot; she told the children . 
as a roomful of excited children launched the video EU finance ministers meeting several hundred metres away were locked in intense discussions over whether the EU &apos;s powerhouses would meet the convergence criteria set for qualifying for the third stage of EU economic and monetary union . 
Elisabeth Guigou , a former French European Affairs minister now a member of the European Parliament , told the children they were the people who would have to live with the money . 
&quot; It &apos;s you who will live with the single currency and it &apos;s you have to learn how to use it . 
it &apos;s often children who teach their parents new activities , &quot; she said . 
the video , made originally in French , has been translated into English , Italian and Dutch and will be available to schools , television stations and conferences .
