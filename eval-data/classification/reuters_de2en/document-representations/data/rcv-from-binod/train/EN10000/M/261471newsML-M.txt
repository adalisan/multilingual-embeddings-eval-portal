U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets turned fairly active at $ 65.00 per cwt near midday Tuesday , feedlot sources said . 
about 5,000 head sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area and about 20,600 in Kansas , according to USDA and private sources . 
sales were tied to ideas that some cattle owners gave up holding out for $ 66.00 because bitterly cold temperatures were stressing cattle and they didn &apos;t want to pay for more feed to maintain weight gains , several feedlot sources said . 
temperatures overnight were projected to dip below 10 degrees Fahrenheit in the Panhandle again , with wind chills of 20 below zero , the feedlot sources said . 
prices also were expected to be supported by firm boxed beef prices at midday , market sources said . 
beef prices were quoted up $ 0.59 to $ 1.01 per cwt , with 190 fabricated loads sold , according to USDA . 
beef prices were firm on late retail fill-in buying by retailers for Christmas and New Years holiday features , said Dale Benson , livestock analyst with Dean-Witter Reynolds .
