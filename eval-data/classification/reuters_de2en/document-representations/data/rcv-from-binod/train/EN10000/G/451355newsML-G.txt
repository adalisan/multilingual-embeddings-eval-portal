as opinion poll after opinion poll show huge leads for Britain &apos;s opposition Labour party , it isn &apos;t just the ruling Conservatives who are getting the blues . 
labour &apos;s shift in recent years from the left to the centre of politics is putting the squeeze on the Liberal Democrats whose mixture of pro-Europeanism , willingness to raise taxes and support for constitutional reform shows little sign of attracting mass support . 
Party leader Paddy Ashdown blames the poor showing of the third party in British politics on a media besotted with the battle between Labour , on track to return to power for the first time in 18 years in a general election set for May 1 , and the Conservatives . 
&quot; We &apos;re not getting heard , and yes , I &apos;m a little nervous we won &apos;t get heard at the election , &quot; he said in a recent interview with the weekly New Statesman magazine . 
yet if the prospect of a thumping defeat offers unrelieved gloom for Conservative Prime Minister John Major , the election could ironically provide the Liberal Democrats with their greatest opportunity since the heyday of their Liberal party predecessors almost 70 years ago . 
recent polls have given the Liberal Democrats between 10 and 16 percent support , against the 18.3 percent which in 1992 won them just 20 of the 651 seats in parliament under Britain &apos;s first-past-the-post voting system . 
if they polled towards the lower end of this range , the party &apos;s general election prospects would indeed be bleak . 
but there are two causes for optimism in Liberal ranks if the spotlight on them during the election campaign draws increased support . 
first , the bias against them which the voting system always shows is likely to be less harsh if the Conservatives do badly . 
the 40 to 50 seats which the Liberal Democrats have set their sights on in what will be an unusually long 6-1 / 2-week campaign are overwhelmingly ones where their main foes are the Conservatives , and Labour run a distant third . 
many voters are expected to vote tactically , picking the opposition candidate most likely to defeat the Conservatives . 
and secondly , the Liberal Democrats have just reached an agreement with Labour on a referendum during the next parliament on whether to scrap first-past-the-post in favour of proportional representation , a prize target of Liberal politics for decades . 
voting experts polled by Reuters predict the Liberal Democrats would win 25 seats at the election , which would be marginally the best showing by a third force in British politics since World War Two . 
Bob Worcester , chairman of the MORI polling group , forecast they could win 36 by pulling in disaffected Conservatives in the final days before voting . 
Charles Kennedy , a senior member of the parliamentary party , said he was not unduly dismayed by the opinion polls . 
&quot; The name of the game is to defeat sitting Conservatives , &quot; he told Reuters . 
&quot; voters are looking to see who is best placed to do that . 
so in our target seats , we are extremely confident that our vote is holding up . 
after the Conservative victory with a 21-seat majority in the 1992 general election , the Liberal Democrats rocked the complacency of the governing party by grabbing three seats in parliamentary by-elections and making huge gains in local council polls . 
it added a fourth victory later , and also added to its tally of MPs by welcoming two Conservatives who defected in protest at a perceived rightward shift in government policy . 
the party &apos;s proudest boast is that in local government , where its vote share is consistently higher than at general elections , it has overtaken the Conservatives in terms of both local councils controlled and the number of sitting councillors . 
it has also made its mark in the political debate by refusing to follow Labour and the Conservatives down the road of what some observers see as unrealistic pledges not to raise taxes and populist solutions to law-and-order problems . 
but with the soaring popularity of Labour under moderate leader Tony Blair , the Liberals , no longer the only natural party of those who consider themselves radicals but not socialists , have seen their opinion poll ratings gently decline . 
Ashdown has moved from a stance of so-called equidistance between the two main parties to one in which he clearly favours Labour , and some of his supporters have voiced concern he might &quot; sell out &quot; by accepting a cabinet post under Blair . 
but what they may see as cosying up to Labour has brought rewards in the area of constitutional reform , a subject usually thought of as far dearer to Liberal than to Labour hearts . 
the two parties announced agreement earlier this month on a radical programme including an end to hereditary peers sitting in the upper House of Lords , regional parliaments for Scotland and Wales and a freedom of information act . 
but the big prize for the Liberals was Labour &apos;s undertaking to put the question of voting reform to a referendum -- and to pit first-past-the-post against a system which roughly rewards parties with seats in proportion to the votes cast for them . 
while Blair has given no pledge to back proportional representation ( PR ) during the referendum campaign , some senior Labour figures , such as Robin Cook , expected to be Blair &apos;s foreign secretary , almost certainly would . 
if the change was made , Liberals in Britain , who have not tasted real power outside wartime political pacts since 1922 , could become as influential as their cousins in the many European countries with PR systems , who regularly participate in coalition governments .
