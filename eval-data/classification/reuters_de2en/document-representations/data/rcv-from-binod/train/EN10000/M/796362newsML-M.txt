South American soybean oil and sunflower oil sales are slowing , but Chinese interest is keeping the last embers of the southern season alight as U.S. supply becomes competitive , Argentine traders said Wednesday . 
Argentine-Dutch trader Nidera has been actively seeking oil in the Gulf , reflecting the switch from the southern to the northern oil season , a trader said . 
&quot; Nidera bought 9,000 tonnes of Gulf soyoil from ADM at about $ 200 over , for August shipment , &quot; he said , adding the oil was destined for Bangladesh . 
but , while the South American crush rate is due to slip drastically after September , deliveries remain brisk . 
&quot; The shipping lineups are still pretty decent . 
we have been shipping from South America , Argentina and Brazil combined , about half a million tonnes of soyoil and sunoil a month , &quot; the trader said , &quot; That &apos;s going to slow down , and I expect something closer to 420,000 tonnes for August , and a little slower in September . 
he reported persistant Chinese interest , and intermittent buying by Iran . 
there are also ample freight bookings for Chile and Peru , apparently due to tight fish oil supplies caused by the El Nino current hitting west coast South American catches . 
but South America is already uncompetitive in the Mediterranean , which is supplied by European rape . 
other traders reported slow oil business . 
&quot; I haven &apos;t seen much interest around here for oils , &quot; one said , &quot; Basically China is more interested in oil from the Gulf . 
Argentine soymeal exports sales were also slow , he said . 
&quot; There &apos;s been a bit going on with Denmark , some for China . 
but not so much going on , &quot; he said . 
he added that business might pick up now that Wednesday &apos;s eagerly awaited USDA crop figures were announced . 
most interest has been for meal for September shipment , offered at about $ 20 under Chicago Board of Trade meal , he said . 
the first trader said he had revised an earlier estimate of a one-million-tonne Sept 30 carryover of Argentine soybean meal and pellets , due to a lower-than expected June crush and a pick up in meal demand . 
&quot; I reduced the estimate to 700,000 tonnes , but it &apos;s still a record , &quot; he said .
