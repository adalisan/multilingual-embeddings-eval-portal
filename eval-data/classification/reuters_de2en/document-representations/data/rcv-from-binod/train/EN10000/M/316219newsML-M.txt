Taiwan &apos;s central bank said on Friday the volatility that pushed the local currency sharply higher in recent days reflected normal trends both inside Taiwan &apos;s foreign exchange market and abroad . 
&quot; Movements in the foreign exchange market reflect international and domestic trends . 
appreciation and depreciation are normal , &quot; central bank vice governor Liang Cheng-chin told reporters after the forex market close . 
Liang would not be drawn when asked at an afternoon news conference whether the bank had intervened during a dramatic rise in the value of the Taiwan dollar during the past week , merely restating the bank &apos;s pro-market policy . 
&quot; The central bank &apos;s monetary policy remains to respect market functions , &quot; Liang said . 
after rising through the week to a seven-month high close on Thursday of T $ 27.338 to the U.S. dollar , the local unit slipped slightly on Friday to end at T $ 27.391 . 
in his comments , Liang did not stray from a position stated as recently as Wednesday that the market &apos;s sudden volatility after months of listless trade was both normal and beneficial . 
Tuan Chin-sheng , deputy director general of the central bank &apos;s foreign exchange department , told reporters on Wednesday that the week &apos;s inward and outward remittances were normal and that the Taiwan dollar &apos;s movements were &quot; helpful for increasing market activity and enlarging the market scale &quot; . 
dealers had been saying that the general upward trend was likely to continue ahead of the February 7 lunar new year holiday , traditionally a period of high currency demand . 
but Friday &apos;s downturn prompted some dealers and analysts to say the appreciation may have run its course . 
&quot; Recent sharp movements in the exchange rate were mainly triggered by strong expectations the Taiwan dollar would go up , &quot; said one dealer at a foreign bank . 
&quot; Many investors took the chance to trade actively but they should trade more rationally next week , &quot; the dealer said . 
said a second dealer : &quot; There are not too many fundamentals to cause the Taiwan dollar to rise sharply . 
investors will soon realise that . 
the central bank has consistently stood by what it calls a &quot; stable to loose &quot; monetary policy , hoping to accelerate what has been a disappointingly slow recovery without fanning inflation .
