the South African industrial and all-share indices finished at record closing highs in active trade on Thursday , boosted by a host of positive news . 
dealers said that two upbeat sets of economic data , namely the far higher-than-expected May trade surplus of 1.75 billion rand released earlier and Wednesday &apos;s lower-than-forecast May consumer inflation figure , had cheered the market . 
the announcement that private individuals may invest 200,000 rand offshore from July 1 , well above the 160,000 limit anticipated by the market , had also boosted sentiment .
