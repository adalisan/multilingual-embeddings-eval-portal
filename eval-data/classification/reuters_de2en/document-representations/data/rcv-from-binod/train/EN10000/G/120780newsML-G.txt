French President Jacques Chirac will become the first foreign leader to address the Palestinian Legislative Council next week during a six-day tour of the tense Middle East region , diplomats said . 
seeking to assert a greater French and European role in the region , Chirac will address the 88-strong elected assembly in the West Bank town of Ramallah next Wednesday . 
French officials said the gesture would symbolise support for Palestinian aspirations to statehood despite Israeli opposition , but also backing for parliamentary democracy against any &quot; autocratic temptation &quot; . 
Chirac will fly with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to the Gaza Strip , visit a refugee camp and lay a foundation stone for a disputed Gaza sea port project , they said . 
the French president will be the second European leader to lay a stone for the uncertain $ 60 million project on the Gaza coastline , stymied by Israeli security objections . 
Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok laid the first stone in January . 
the Netherlands is the biggest donor in the project with $ 25 million to France &apos;s $ 20 million . 
Germany will donate the remaining $ 15 million . 
Palestinian and Israeli sources said that although the port was agreed in Israeli-PLO accords , the Israelis object to it on security grounds , since it would give the Palestinians uncontrolled access to the sea . 
the sources say Israel may also have economic and political motives for blocking the port , since Palestinan goods are currently forced to transit through Israel &apos;s port of Ashdod , giving the Jewish state valuable control . 
a hasty attempt by Arafat &apos;s Palestinian Authority to build a Marina for Gaza fishermen in 1994 foundered shortly after Arafat returned from exile , wrecked by winter storms . 
a mangled , rusting pier near his beachfront office is all that remains . 
Chirac will spend a day in the Palestinian self-rule areas after visiting Syria on Saturday and Sunday for talks with President Hafez al-Assad , and Israel on Monday and Tuesday , where he will meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and make a major speech on French Middle East policy in the city of Haifa . 
a French diplomat called Chirac &apos;s trip the most difficult of his 18 months in office . 
he aims seek a political role for the European Union in Middle East peacemaking despite U.S. and Israeli objections . 
the Europeans were excluded from this month &apos;s emergency Arab-Israeli summit in Washington and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher wrote to EU leaders urging them to stay out of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations , diplomats said . 
the French argue that the EU is the main financial sponsor of the peace process and can offer useful proposals and good offices without supplanting Washington as mediator . 
many Arab leaders see the EU as more even-handed than the United States . 
to avoid a clash with hardline Netanyahu , neither Chirac nor Foreign Minister Herve de Charette will visit Orient House in Arab East Jerusalem , the PLO &apos;s unofficial headquarters in the city , which Israel has vowed to close , the sources said . 
however Chirac will visit Christian and Moslem holy places in the Arab Old City without the Israeli mayor of Jerusalem , Ehud Olmert , underlining the fact that France does not recognise Israeli sovereignty over the eastern half of the city , annexed after it was captured from Jordan in 1967 . 
after the Palestinian territories , Chirac will make brief visits to Jordan , Lebanon and Egypt on October 24-25 .
