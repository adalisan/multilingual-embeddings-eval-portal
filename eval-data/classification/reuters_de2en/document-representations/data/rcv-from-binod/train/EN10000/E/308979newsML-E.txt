a financially troubled Illinois school district that is under a court order to issue debt for building projects has turned to a state bonding agency for assistance . 
the Illinois Development Finance Authority on Wednesday gave preliminary approval to the sale of up to $ 55 million of certificates of participation for the Rockford School District . 
the deal marks the first COPs issue that the agency would be involved in , according to Bobby Wilkerson , the authority &apos;s director . 
under the deal &apos;s structure outlined in an authority memo , the COPs would be a general obligation of the school district secured by a LIEN against property tax receipts . 
those receipts would flow directly from the Winnebago County collector &apos;s office to an escrow held by a trustee . 
because the Illinois Development Finance Authority has exhausted its state authorization to issue local government bonds , the COPs would ultimately be issued by a grantor trust , according to agency officials . 
the agency &apos;s role would be providing an intercept of state aid payments to the school district should property tax collections prove insufficient , the officials said . 
that intercept was one requirement for obtaining insurance on the deal , according to Linda Bobert , a senior vice president at Banc One Capital Corp. , the underwriter on the COPs deal . 
a school district official has said that the district was working with Financial Security Assurance on the deal . 
last month , a U.S. District Court judge staid an order requiring the school district to complete the COPs sale by Dec . 31 . 
Bobert said Wednesday that there was no new deadline imposed by the federal court to get the issue sold . 
the deal would allow the Rockford district to comply with a federal court order in an ongoing desegregation case to build three new schools . 
last month the district submitted to the court a five-year financial plan on dealing with reoccuring operating deficits . 
the district currently has a $ 15 million deficit in its $ 200 million fiscal 1997 budget .
