a Sikh party was poised on Monday to rule India &apos;s Punjab state for the next five years after a landslide victory in the farming region &apos;s first peaceful elections in nearly two decades . 
the Akali Dal , led by former chief minister Prakash Singh Badal , and its ally the rightwing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) won an overwhelming four-fifths of the 117 seats in the state legislature . 
&quot; The Hindus dominate the cities . 
Sikhs dominate the countryside . 
the combination is formidable , &quot; said Ashis Nandy , an analyst at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in New Delhi . 
it was a significant win for the Sikh party , which won a dominant 74 seats after boycotting the last Punjab elections in 1992 . 
the state &apos;s ruling Congress party was reduced to a humiliating also-ran with only 14 seats . 
&quot; This is a sweeping victory , a good result from unprecedented peaceful polls , &quot; Punjab &apos;s chief electoral officer Brajendra Singh told Reuters . 
&quot; I would like to concede victory to the Akali Dal , &quot; Congress general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad told state-run Doordarshan television . 
&quot; We may have lost , but democracy has won . 
election officials noted that a strong 69 percent of the state &apos;s 15 million voters had turned out for Friday &apos;s polls , in sharp contrast with 1992 when a scant 22 percent voted in an election overshadowed by Sikh separatist violence . 
&quot; It is a historic win at a historic moment for Punjab . 
it signals an era of peace and prosperity , &quot; Akali Dal spokesman Kanwaljit Singh told Reuters . 
a rival , pro-separatist faction of the Akali Dal won just one seat in Monday &apos;s final tally . 
its leader , former police official turned militant Simranjit Singh Mann , was defeated . 
State officials said the 69-year-old Badal was expected to take office as Punjab &apos;s chief minister later this week . 
the rich farming region bordering Pakistan was roiled by years of guerrilla violence that peaked in June 1984 when the army attacked Sikhdom &apos;s holiest shrine , the Golden Temple , to flush out militants holed up there . 
four months later then prime minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards and India &apos;s capital Delhi was rocked by anti-Sikh rioting . 
Sikh-Hindu ties frayed as the militants pursued their goal of a separate Sikh homeland called Khalistan , but the revolt was put down by a harsh security crackdown . 
nearly 20,000 people died in the violence . 
analysts said the Akali Dal &apos;s poll alliance with the BJP offered Sikhs and Hindus a chance to overcome the distrust . 
&quot; The Akalis never encouraged militancy . 
they were soft on the militants . 
the militancy was the handiwork of groups which were opposed to the Akalis , &quot; Nandy said . 
Kanwaljit Singh , a former interior minister , underlined the new mood of reconciliation , saying the Akali Dal had shifted its focus from the welfare of the state &apos;s majority Sikhs to friendship with its minority Hindus . 
&quot; Hindus may be in a minority in Punjab , but we have realised that the state cannot progress without their total involvement in its governance , &quot; he said .
