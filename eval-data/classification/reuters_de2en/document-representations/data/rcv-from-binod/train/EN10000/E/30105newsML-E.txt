a key gauge of economic activity posted a slight gain in July , the Conference Board said Tuesday , adding to signs the economy had considerable momentum as the second half began . 
the Index of leading Indicators , which is supposed to forecast economic trends six to nine months ahead , rose by 0.2 percent after a 0.5 percent increase in June . 
it was a sixth consecutive monthly increase in the broad-based gauge of national activity and fit with other recent reports showing the economy was slowing only gradually after the strongest second-quarter expansion in two years . 
the index measures a basket of economic indicators , from unemployment benefit claims to building permits . 
six of its 11 components were stronger in July , while five weakened from June . 
the signals of rising activity during July were led by higher commodity prices , fewer new claims for unemployment benefits and more consumer goods orders . 
in addition , contracts and orders for plant and equipment increased from June , there were more applications for building permits and stronger consumer expectations for the future . 
the five negative indicators included a shorter average workweek , lower stock prices and faster vendor deliveries . 
in addition , order backlogs were smaller than in June and the money supply was lower , the Conference Board said . 
growth in the national economy surged at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the second quarter -- the strongest performance since the second quarter of 1994 , when it expanded at a 4.9 percent rate . 
though most analysts say the rate of expansion is decelerating , they say it remains an open question whether it is losing steam rapidly enough to head off interest-rate rises by the Federal Reserve later this year in a bid to keep inflation pressures under control . 
the Fed &apos;s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee next meets on Sept . 24 to set interest-rate strategy after opting to keep rates steady at its last meeting in August . 
there are indications the economy continues to expand briskly . 
last week , the Commerce Department reported a strong 1.8 percent increase in factory orders during July and a 7.9 percent jump in July new-home sales , as strong job growth fuelled consumer confidence about the economy .
