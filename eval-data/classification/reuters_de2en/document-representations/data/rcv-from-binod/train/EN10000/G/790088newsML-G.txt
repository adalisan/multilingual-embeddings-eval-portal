a U.S. Middle East peace envoy met Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday and Palestinians insisted the American &apos;s mission must not be limited to dealing with security concerns . 
special envoy Dennis Ross told reporters in Jerusalem earlier that U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright wanted him to focus on security questions . 
&quot; We cannot confine the talks to security issues . 
this means we will have no talks at all because security is part of the overall peace process , &quot; Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo told Reuters before Arafat met Ross in self-ruled Ramallah . 
&quot; This is the Palestinian leadership &apos;s decision -- that all issues should be discussed with Ross in order to reach positive results , &quot; Abed Rabbo said , underscoring the hardships facing the envoy &apos;s mission . 
the United States sent Ross to the Middle East to ease tensions plunged deeper into crisis by a July 30 suicide bombing at an Israeli market that killed 15 people including two Islamic suicide bombers . 
Ross met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem before going to Ramallah . 
Arafat wants Israel to ease a security clampdown on Palestinians . 
Israel closed off the West Bank and Gaza after the market attack and conditioned any resumption of talks on Arafat cracking down on Islamic militant groups .
