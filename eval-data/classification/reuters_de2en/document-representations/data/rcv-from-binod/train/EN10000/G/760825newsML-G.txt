French Defence Minister Alain Richard held talks on bilateral cooperation with his Saudi counterpart Prince Sultan in the port city of Jeddah , the official Saudi Press Agency ( SPA ) said late on Sunday . 
Richard , who was appointed in June after parliamentary elections , made a detour to the kingdom on his way from Egypt to France for what Prince Sultan had called a &quot; familiarisation visit &quot; . 
&quot; We support cooperation between the two friendly countries , the kingdom and France , in terms of economic cooperation and the development of joint industries between the two countries , &quot; Prince Sultan said in remarks carried by SPA . 
Richard returned to France on Sunday after spending several hours in the kingdom . 
France , which buys one quarter of its oil from Saudi Arabia , is the kingdom &apos;s third biggest arms supplier after the United States and Britain . 
weapons sales average $ 1.2 billion a year . 
France is trying to convince Saudi Arabia to buy Leclerq main battle tanks made by GIAT Industries , similar to those sold for $ 3.62 billion to the neighbouring United Arab Emirates in 1993 . 
it is competing with Britain and the United States for the major arms contract after its tanks were tested in the Saudi desert at Riyadh &apos;s request . 
Richard declined to comment on the results of tests performed with the tanks . 
but after his return to Paris , officials in Richard &apos;s office told reporters Saudi authorities were satisfied with the Leclerq tests in their country . 
&quot; The minister did not come to negotiate contracts . 
that is the task of the industrialists . 
the government &apos;s role is to see if everything is going well and eventually to bring its expertise , &quot; a spokesman said . 
he added that Saudi Arabia was not expected to take a decision on tank purchases until the middle of next year and that the contract at stake was for some 300 vehicles . 
the two men also discussed the Middle East peace process , ties with Iraq and Iran as well as security in the Gulf , and &quot; agreed on most regional problems &quot; , the spokesman added .
