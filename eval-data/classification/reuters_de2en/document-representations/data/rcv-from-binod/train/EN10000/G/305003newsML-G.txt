Italy &apos;s Alberto Tomba tumbled out of the top 15 of the World Cup giant slalom rankings on Tuesday and the fall may have seriously hurt his chances of defending his world championship crown . 
still battling the flu bug that forced him out of the second leg of the slalom in Chamonix last Sunday , Tomba chose not to race in Adelboden , the final giant slalom before next month &apos;s championships in Sestriere . 
his absence could prove costly . 
for the first time in a decade , the flamboyant Italian , winner of three Olympic golds including two in the giant slalom , finds himself outside the seeded first 15 skiers and will not have the luxury of drawing his start number at the championships . 
hampered by injury and illness , Tomba has not completed a giant slalom this season . 
in his only race on January 5 in Kranjska Gora he failed to finish , skiing out in the second run . 
Tomba &apos;s inactivity has not only left him rusty but a lowly 21st in the rankings . 
before they race for the giant slalom gold on February 12 however , Tomba could move up the rankings and possibly back into the top 15 depending on which skiers are nominated by their countries for the race . 
for the world championships each country is allowed only four skiers per event . 
currently there are seven Austrians ahead of Tomba in the rankings , meaning he could be ranked no worse than 18th . 
Tomba may also choose not to defend his giant slalom title and concentrate on claiming a second slalom crown instead .
