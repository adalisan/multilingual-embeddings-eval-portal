survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing , the first witnesses in the trial of Timothy McVeigh , on Friday vividly recreated the morning of the blast , recalling desperate searches for loved ones lost in the rubble . 
Susan Hunt , one of nine witnesses in the first day of testimony , described caring for her co-workers in the Alfred P. Murrah federal building injured in the April 19 , 1995 , explosion . 
&apos; &quot; she testified . 
Helena Garrett sobbed , and moved many listeners to tears , as she testified about the frantic hunt for her 16-month-old son Tevin in the chaos . 
she saw babies being carried out of the debris . 
not realising they were dead , she begged rescuers , &quot; Please don &apos;t put our babies on the glass &quot; from shattered windows on the ground . 
Garrett could not find Tevin that day and did not learn officially that he was dead for three days . 
his head was so badly mangled that funeral directors would not let her see his wounds , she said . 
nineteen children were among the 168 people killed . 
the prosecution claims McVeigh , motivated by anti-government hatred and extremist politics , blew up the federal building in hopes of provoking a &quot; second American Revolution . 
also among those searching the rubble that day was Sgt. 
John Avera , who crawled in the dark depths to follow victims &apos; cries . 
that baby was P.J. 
Allen , who was rescued and survived . 
then Avera found a second baby in a hole , but &quot; I couldn &apos;t feel any life , &quot; he said . 
he handed her to a firefighter outside -- a moment captured in a famous photograph that later won a Pulitzer prize . 
please take it , &quot; he said . 
the child was Baylee Almon , killed the day after her first birthday . 
McVeigh , 29 , wearing an open-necked white shirt and khaki trousers , watched closely and took notes . 
the tall , thin Gulf War veteran has pleaded not guilty to murder and conspiracy charges and could face the death penalty if convicted . 
defence attorneys have tried to undermine the government &apos;s case by suggesting the possibility of an uncaptured accomplice , confused eyewitnesses and FBI mishandling of the evidence . 
the court proceedings began with jurors listening to the sounds of the blast , captured on a tape of a hearing of the Oklahoma Water Resources Board across the street . 
after about two minutes of voices , the tape is interrupted by a huge roar , crashes , rumblings and the frightened shout of &quot; Let &apos;s get out of here . 
victims &apos; family members in the courtroom tensed visibly at the start of the harrowing tape and reached for one another tearfully as the deadly explosion was heard . 
hunt , who worked for the Department of Housing and Urban Development , recalled her co-worker Lee sells chatting with a friend just before the explosion . 
asked by a prosecutor if she ever heard sells &apos; voice again , Hunt replied , &quot; No , I did not . 
Roy sells , seated in the courtroom , bowed his head and began to cry at the mention of his late wife . 
former Marine Corps recruiter Michael Norfleet testified that the bomb &quot; filleted open &quot; his right eye , leaving him partly blind and destroying his dreams of being a pilot .
