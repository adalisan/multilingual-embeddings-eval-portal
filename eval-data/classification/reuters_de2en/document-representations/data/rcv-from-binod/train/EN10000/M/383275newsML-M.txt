Tokyo stocks closed marginally higher on Monday , managing to climb for the fifth trading day in a row . 
but brokers said power to extend gains ebbed in light trading volume as profit-taking pressure was strong below 19,000 in the key market index . 
the benchmark Nikkei 225 average ended up 28.65 points or 0.15 percent at 18,750.65 . 
it briefly rose to 18,854.46 . 
its March futures finished unchanged at 18,720 . 
&quot; Participants were adjusting their positions today to test the 19,000 to 19,500 level , &quot; said Ryoichi Ohta , general manager at Tokyo Securities Co Ltd . 
he said the range of rising shares had widened to the shipbuilding and pharmaceutical sectors and laggards among blue-chip issues . 
positive sentiment was carried over from last week , when the yen &quot; s weakness against the dollar helped boost multinational blue-chip issues and shares in less competitive firms such as those in the steel sector . 
meanwhile , fears over the health of the financial sector had eased , brokers said .
