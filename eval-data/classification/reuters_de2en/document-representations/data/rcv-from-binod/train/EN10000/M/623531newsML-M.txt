hopes for an economic turnaround and sharply declining interest rates fuelled healthy buying of Seoul shares and sent the main stock index soaring to a new 1997 high on Thursday , brokers and analysts said . 
the composite stock index shot up 11.25 points to 749.37 in the first few minutes of trading . 
profit-taking pulled it off that perch almost immediately , but the index stood at 742.50 at day &apos;s end , the highest close so far this year . 
abundant market liquidity pulled down yields on three-year benchmark corporate bonds to 11.86 percent on Thursday after they hit a three-month low of 11.98 percent on Wednesday . 
&quot; falling interest rates mean institutions remain fluid , &quot; said Park Key-pyong of Hanyang Securities . 
analysts said the yen &apos;s appreciation and rising export prices contributed to raising investor hopes for recovery . 
Steve Marvin , head of research at Ssangyong Securities , attributedd the bull-run to &quot; anticipation among investors that the trade account and the economy will start to improve from the second half this year and diminishing fears of a financial meltdown in Korea . 
as long as the yen did not depreciate substantially , Asian economic growth remained firm and there were no more major bankruptcies , Marvin said the market would continue to rise . 
&quot; I turned bullish in the market at the end of April for those reasons , &quot; he said . 
optimistic analysts forecast the market would head for 800 after a consolidation at around 750 . 
but others disagreed . 
&quot; The market will not really turn bullish unless there is firm confidence in an economic recovery and interest rates fall to the 10 percent level , &quot; said Choi Bum of C.S. 
first Boston . 
the central Bank of Korea said the current account deficit eased to $ 1.7 billion in April from $ 2.36 billion a year ago . 
however , economists cautioned against excessive optimism . 
slowing imports of capital goods contributed to reducing the deficit , but could bode ill for economic recovery . 
&quot; Despite an improvement in April , it is still hard to see an economic recovery , &quot; said Lee Choon-yul , economist at Korea Institute of Finance . 
brokers said large-capitalised shares , especially low-priced manufacturers and interest-sensitive construction and financial shares , were in strong demand . 
the large-cap sub-index rose 9.83 points , or 1.84 percent , to 1,493.82 . 
LG electronics rose 800 won to 14,900 ( $ 16.70 ) , off a new year &apos;s high of 15,200 with heavy volume of 1.7 million shares . 
brokers said electronic home appliance makers were seen as major beneficiaries of an economic turnaround . 
Daewoo Securities traded most actively with 1.74 million shares changing hands . 
it gained 700 won to 11,200 . 
&quot; Large-capitalised shares have more room to rise , &quot; said Lee Ki-ho , market strategist at LG Securities . 
brokers said active foreign buying , focusing on undervalued blue chips , fuelled the rally . 
the securities watchdog said net foreign purchase reached 70.3 billion won on Thursday . 
Casey Choe of Union Bank of Switzerland said foreign fund managers had tried to expand their Korean investment tools after unloading their holdings since last year . 
but Choi of C.S. 
first Boston said : &quot; Foreign investors have incited the recent rally . 
but most of them are short-term punters looking for quick profits . 
they switched from peaked Asian stock markets to Korea .
