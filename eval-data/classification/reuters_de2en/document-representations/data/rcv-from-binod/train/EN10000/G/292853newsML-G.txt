a second cold surge behind the current Arctic front from Canada is expected to prolong into next week cold Midwest and Northeast temperatures , a reversal of earlier forecasts of milder weather to come , weather Services Corp said . 
originally , forecasters were calling for a warming trend to kick in on Monday after below-normal temperatures through the weekend for both regions . 
but instead of the warmup it now &quot; looks like it &apos;s turning colder and then staying below normal for the rest of next week , &quot; said Joel Burgio of weather Services Corp. 
for the Midcontinent , weather Services is forecasting temperatures eight to 15-degrees below normal for the weekend and 5 to 10 degrees below normal on Monday . 
the Northeast will see normal to two-degrees below normal temperatures on Sunday , a range expected to linger on Monday and beyond , said weather Services . 
&quot; It &apos;s not so much how cold it will be , but that it will be staying cool for longer , &quot; said Burgio .
