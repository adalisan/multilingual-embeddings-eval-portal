Chipper Jones delivered a happy ending on a special night in Atlanta Friday as he drove in the go-ahead run in the eighth to boost the braves to a 5-4 win over the Chicago Cubs in the first regular-season game at their new Turner Field home . 
&quot; This is a great win , &quot; said Jones . 
&quot; It was cool tonight . 
all the guys were up for the pre-game ceremony , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Hank ( Aaron ) walking out of centre field gave me chill bumps . 
the whole team was pumped up . 
everything did not go smoothly at first . 
the game was delayed for six minutes in the bottom of the first inning due to a power outage that was caused when a car ran into a transformer outside the stadium . 
then the braves , who lost two of three in Houston before coming home to open their new park , fell behind and trailed 4-2 in the seventh before mounting their charge . 
Brad Clontz ( 1-0 ) pitched 1 1 / 3 hitless innings to get the win . 
mark Wohlers picked up his second save . 
following the game , there was a fireworks display honouring the National League champion braves as the team of the &apos; 90s . 
&quot; That &apos;s kind of cool . 
we &apos;re 70 games better than anyone else , &quot; Jones said , defending the braves &apos; claim . 
Terry Adams ( 0-1 ) took the loss for the Cubs , who are 0-4 . 
at Florida , Reggie Sanders tied a career high with six RBI , including a three-run Homer that began a six-run seventh inning , as the Cincinnati reds rallied for a 9-7 victory over the Florida Marlins . 
the reds erased a 6-3 deficit with their big rally . 
Jeff Conine , who is 9-for-15 for the season , and Charles Johnson hit back-to-back homers for Florida in the fifth . 
Kent Mercker ( 1-0 ) picked up the win . 
Cincinnati &apos;s hal Morris went 0-for-4 to end a 32-game hit streak dating back to last season . 
in Montreal , former Expo Larry Walker hit his league-leading third home run and drove in two as the Colorado Rockies handed Montreal its first loss of the season 5-4 . 
Walker delivered an RBI double in a two-run first inning , then led off the sixth with a Homer . 
&quot; I was expecting the boos , but we got the win and there was cheering on our side afterwards . 
that &apos;s all that matters , &quot; Walker said . 
&quot; That home run was one of the hardest balls I ever hit . 
it was out over the plate and it just kept going . 
Jamey Wright took the win , and Marc Valdes was the loser . 
in Houston , Jeff Bagwell &apos;s one-out single in the bottom of the 11th inning scored Ray Montgomery with the winning run as the Houston Astros edged the winless St. Louis Cardinals 3-2 . 
Russ Springer ( 1-0 ) pitched a scoreless 11th for his first victory as an Astro . 
reliever Eric Ludwick allowed one run and two hits while retiring only one batter for St. Louis ( 0-4 ) . 
&quot; There have been some high-scoring games in other parks in the country at the start of the season , but not here , &quot; said Astros rookie manager Larry Dierker . 
&quot; This was Astrodome-type baseball . 
when we win , this is how we win -- by keeping it close and trying to get the last run . 
in Los Angeles , Billy Ashley and rookie Wilton Guerrero each drove in runs in the seventh inning to lift the Los Angeles dodgers to their third straight win , 5-3 over the Pittsburgh Pirates . 
Tom Candiotti ( 1-0 ) , forced out of the starting rotation , picked up the win with two scoreless innings of relief . 
Todd Worrell worked a 1-2-3 ninth for his second save . 
Dave Wainhouse took the loss . 
Raul Mondesi hit a solo Homer -- his second in as many games -- in the eighth for Los Angeles . 
in San Diego , Greg Vaughn hit a pair of solo homers and Wally Joyner added another as the San Diego Padres used a pair of five-run innings to power their way past the Philadelphia Phillies 13-3 . 
TIM Worrell gave up two runs and four hits over seven innings for the win . 
Bobby Munoz was the loser . 
in San Francisco , Glenallen Hill &apos;s RBI single snapped a tie and keyed a three-run seventh inning as the San Francisco giants defeated the New York Mets 6-4 . 
hill also threw out the potential go-ahead run at the plate to end the top of the seventh , gunning down Andy Tomberlin , who was trying to score on John Olerud &apos;s single . 
the play made a winner out of Rich Rodriguez ( 1-1 ) . 
Rod Beck allowed a run in the ninth , but got his second save when he struck out Olerud with men at first and second . 
reliever Ricardo Jordan ( 0-2 ) took the loss as the Mets bullpen again failed to deliver .
