Hungarian shares drifted slightly lower on Wednesday on profit-takings and mainly due to the losses of chemicals maker TVK and oil and gas company MOL , traders said . 
&quot; At the current price levels the bourse ( Budapest Stock Exchange ) seems to have reached a balance , &quot; said Peter Lencs of MKB Securities . 
&quot; Prices are likely to stagnate until news increases the appetite for buying . 
according to preliminary figures , the BUX index closed down 0.21 percent or 12.46 points at 5,978.86 points . 
half of the 38 stocks which traded on Wednesday dropped . 
this dealers attributed to the slack interest of foreign investors . 
traders said that profit-taking came as a correction of a bull-run earlier this week , which raised the BUX to a new intra-day trading high of 6,012.20 points on Tuesday . 
some traders said the Czech government &apos;s fight for stabilising the crown made some investors , who are looking at the region , cautious , while other traders played down the significance of this impact . 
traders said investors locked in profits following the domestic and international offerings of MOL earlier this month . 
&quot; Many investors still have shares which were bought at a discount of some 10 percent , &quot; Lencs said . 
new York brokers Attila Gazdik said news about gas price rises expected for later this year would push MOL up , but some investors did not see the stock rising for the short term and they may have replaced their MOL shares with other stocks . 
traders attributed that to profit-takings following a sharp rise in the past few months . 
despite the price falls on the Hungarian bourse , the index changed little , mainly thanks to drug maker Richter , which closed at 15,280 forints , up 205 , traders said . 
&quot; Back in December , Richter stood at 8,0008 forints , &quot; Gazdik said . 
&quot; But the company is good , its results are good and it has outstanding prospects ... Everybody recommends it to buy . 
some traders said the Hungarian market needed some good news to rise again , while others believed the BUX may firm already this week .
