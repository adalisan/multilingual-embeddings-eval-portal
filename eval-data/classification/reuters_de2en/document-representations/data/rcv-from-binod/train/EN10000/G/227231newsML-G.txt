China said on Sunday the number of full-blown AIDS cases had risen to 133 and urged its researchers seeking a herbal cure to be cautious before announcing major breakthroughs . 
&quot; We are fully convinced that China &apos;s traditional herbal medicines can contribute significantly to global AIDS control if we continue conducting rigorous and scientific research on it , &quot; the Xinhua news agency quoted Kang Laiyi , director of the Shanghai Municipal AIDS Surveillance Centre , as saying . 
however , while Chinese herbal medicines offered hope to the campaign to fight AIDS , China &apos;s pharmacologists should gather more evidence about their effectiveness before announcing major breakthroughs , Kang said . 
China reported a total of 5,157 ( human immunodeficiency virus ) cases at the end of October , up from 4,305 at the end of August , the Xinhua news agency said . 
the revised total of 133 cases of full-blown AIDS was up by two from the end of August , Xinhua said . 
the medicine was found to generally improve the immune systems of animals with neither long- or short-term toxic effects , he said . 
clinical use of the medicine on several AIDS patients showed their symptoms had been clearly alleviated and the functions of their immune systems were resuming , he said . 
&quot; Although we &apos;re still detecting HIV RNA ( ribonucleic acid ) in the patients &apos; blood , the medicine has shown signs of having a curative effect on AIDS , &quot; Kang said . 
State media frequently trumpet reports of Chinese breakthroughs in finding AIDS cures , but apparently no independent assessment had been issued to back up those pronouncements . 
&quot; We should make further studies and establish more convincing facts before we reach the final conclusion , &quot; Kang cautioned of his findings . 
Kang , a member of the National Prevention and Control Committee of AIDS Experts , urged local researchers to be more responsible in their AIDS drug research using herbal medicines . 
&quot; We should keep a tight control on medicine quality , conduct ... clinical experiments and establish detailed observation indexes , &quot; he said . 
developing effective but affordable drugs to treat AIDS was an important task , he said .
