Germany &apos;s economy will grow steadily this year and next with inflation climbing only marginally , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) said in its World Economic Outlook report on Wednesday . 
the IMF said after expanding at a sluggish 1.4 percent pace in 1996 , German gross domestic product would grow 2.3 percent this year and 3.0 percent in 1998 . 
faster economic growth , however , will likely be accompanied by only a modest increase in inflation from 1996 &apos;s 1.5 percent rate to 1.8 percent this year and 2.0 percent in 1998 . 
the IMF noted that Germany faces difficulty with unemployment at record highs , and mixed business and consumer confidence , but that exports will eventually spill over into domestic demand which will also get a boost from low interest rates . 
&quot; All these developments provide good reasons to expect the recovery to gain some momentum , &quot; the report said . 
the report was issued in Washington . 
the IMF , however , acknowledged that economic risks are still present and would not rule out the chance that the Bundesbank and the Bank of France may lower rates . 
&quot; ... it is too early to conclude that the process of monetary easing has fully run its course , &quot; the IMF said . 
the report expressed some doubt as to whether Germany would be able to reduce its budget deficit to the three percent of gross domestic product maximum which the Maastricht Treaty mandates for those joining European monetary union . 
&quot; ... the fiscal program for 1997 aims to reduce the budget deficit to below three percent of GDP to meet the Maastricht criteria , although fully achieving this objective may be difficult without additional policy action . 
the IMF said due to what it called an &quot; output gap , &quot; inflation will remain subdued , noting that weaker-than-expected investment and consumption could delay prospects for recovery . 
the report went on to say that a weaker mark and low German interest rates were helping to contain long-term interest rates in the face of higher U.S. bond yields . 
from a structural standpoint , Germany needed to make its labour market more flexible and overcome problems posed by massive transfers to funds to east German states .
