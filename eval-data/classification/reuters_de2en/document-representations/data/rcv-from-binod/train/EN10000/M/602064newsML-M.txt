CBOT soybean futures ended higher on a late rally tied to short covering ahead of Thursday &apos;s USDA weekly export sales report , traders said . 
&quot; People are waiting to see what the weekly export sales will be , &quot; said Jerry Gidel , analyst with Dean Witter . 
trade estimates for the report , due at 0730 CDT on Thursday , ranged from 100,000 to 200,000 tonnes . 
while those figures were low , Gidel said the export pace needed to remain at or below those levels to meet USDA &apos;s projections . 
new crop months ended slightly higher amid ideas cool weather is slowing crop emergence and early development . 
there was scattered talk of a frost warning issued for the eastern Corn Belt for early Thursday . 
cash merchants there said crops in the northern tier had not yet emerged and would likely be protected from the cold but in the southern parts of Ohio and Indiana , some fields would be at risk . 
reports that Argentina &apos;s Agricultural Secretariat planned to shave one million tonnes off its crop production figures also lent support . 
after the close , the secretariat cut its production forecast by 1.4 million tonnes to 11.5 million . 
soybeans ended 2-1 / 4 to 1 / 4 cents per bushel higher with July up 2-1 / 4 at $ 8.47-1 / 4 .
