U.S. municipal bond trading was extremely quiet in early Monday action , as traders said prices would probably be slightly softer if any actually changed hands . 
&quot; Mondays have been very frustrating , &quot; one trader said , referring to the lack of activity that has characterized the start of the week in recent months . 
but the trader noted that the government long bond was down 12 / 32 at 98-20 / 32 to yield 6.61 percent , and futures are also lower . 
Muni cash would probably be slightly softer as a result , he said . 
the softness comes following Friday &apos;s session , when municipals gained 3 / 8 point to as much as 1 / 2 point in spots , as unsold bonds from last week &apos;s new issues continued to hold back a stronger rally . 
this week &apos;s supply is not as heavy as in recent weeks , as the holiday approaches . 
scheduled competitive and negotiated municipal bond sales are expected to total $ 3.14 billion in 109 offerings for the week , according to Reuters Municipal Bond Information Group . 
competitive sales total $ 680 million in 65 issues . 
the largest issue is a $ 130 million King County , wash . , issue on Monday . 
negotiated sales total $ 2.46 billion in 44 offerings . 
the largest is a $ 626 million New York City deal through Lehman Brothers . 
new York officials said they received about $ 112 million of retail orders for the deal last week ahead of Tuesday &apos;s expected pricing . 
in the muni secondary , bids on Dade County , Fla . , FGIC 5-1 / 2s of 2025 were up two basis points to 5.69 percent net . 
Muni futures were flat , with the March contract unchanged at 115-18 / 32 . 
March T-bonds , meanwhile , were 5 / 32 lower at 113-3 / 32 .
