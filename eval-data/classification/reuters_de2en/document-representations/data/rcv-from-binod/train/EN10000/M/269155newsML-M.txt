crude oil tanker chartering rates for Very Large and ultra Large crude Carriers ( ULCCs and VLCCs ) sailing from the Mideast to Japan were stable on Friday but the approach of new wordscale rates was muddying rate assessments , shipbrokers said . 
Vela fixed the 500,000 tonne Kapetan Michalis at W42.5 for a Mideast / Japan voyage while ULCCs to the Red Sea were seen fixed at between W43.5 and W45 . 
rates for 250,000 tonne VLCCs were strong again for this route and were assessed at around W62.5 on the 1997 worldscale rates . 
this represents a gain of around five points on the week , brokers Galbraiths said in a report . 
almost all of the new rush of VLCC mideast fixtures were for eastwards voyages . 
the remainder were mostly fixtures to the Red Sea and South Africa . 
West African rates were hard to assess , with the 135,000 tonne Tromso reliance fixed to the U.S. Gulf at W87.5 ( 1997 . 
) But this compares with the fixture of the 130,000 tonne Mega buck , an older ship , at W85 ( 1996 . 
) &quot; It is a two-tier market , &quot; one broker said , and assessed this route at W82.5-87.5 at 1997 rates . 
five two-million barrel ships were seen freshly fixed from West Africa to the U.S. Gulf at W62.5 , and this was seen little changed from preceding days . 
around six 70,000 tonners were freshly fixed for Caribbean / USG routes and charterers were paying around W160 . 
this is a week-on-week rise of around ten points . 
steady enquiry in the U.K. CONT region has pushed rates for 80,000 tonne Aframax tankers up to around W110 . 
rates in the Mediterranean for similar sized ships remain unchanged at around W107.5-W110. 
but rates for 130,000 Suezmax tankers has settled at around W80 .
