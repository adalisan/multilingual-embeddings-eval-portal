Seoul stocks are expected to gain further momentum on a technical rebound on Friday , brokers said , as investor jitters about more corporate failures subsided . 
they said low-priced large-cap shares and Ssangyong Group shares would lead the rebound . 
&quot; The government &apos;s move announced yesterday helped soothe nervous investor sentiment , &quot; said Choi Dong-chul at Ssangyong Securities . 
the composite stock index closed on Thursday at 739.04 , rising 8.46 points . 
the finance ministry said it would supply 1.5 trillion won to banks and merchant banks to ease tightening liquidity as a result of troubles with Kia . 
also , the Securities Supervisory Board started on Thursday cracking down on rumour mongers to protect investors and corporate activities . 
it said corporate-related rumours , which had subsided after the Hanbo and Jinro group crises , had increased after the Kia Group &apos;s troubles surfaced last week . 
brokers said the crackdown would block rumours that other companies were facing financial problems or would follow Kia &apos;s case .
