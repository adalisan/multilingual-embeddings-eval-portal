the Nikkei 50 in London closed 2.61 points higher at 1,591.92 after the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo surged 461.45 points to 20,351.34 - a gain of more than two percent - as stable currencies encouraged buying of high-tech exporters . 
canon Inc rose 30 yen from its Tokyo close to end the session at 2,980 yen while M.E.I. 
edged 5 yen higher to close at 2,235 yen , with a good performance by high-tech stocks in New York overnight adding to the positive sentiment . 
dealers said although the dollar weakened against the yen throughout the London session , they did not expect a strong negative reaction by the market in Tokyo . 
&quot; There is support for the Nikkei 225 at the 20,000 level , so I don &apos;t expect too much downside , &quot; said one dealer .
