tens of thousands of Peruvians marched to the Japanese embassy residence on Sunday to demand that Marxist rebels inside release about 340 captives , but the government and the hostage-takers remained far from a solution . 
as the hostage crisis neared the end of its fifth gruelling day -- with conditions inside the sweaty , overcrowded residence deteriorating -- Peruvian citizens made their plea for a peaceful solution . 
&quot; I want the terrorists to hear us so that I can have my father back for Christmas , &quot; said marcher Jose Untama . 
dressed in white and green to symbolise peace and hope , the protesters , chanting &quot; Peace , peace . 
freedom for the hostages , &quot; were stopped a block short of the besieged residence by riot police . 
there was no visible response from within the building . 
echoed by similar smaller marches in provincial towns , the Lima demonstration brought together men and women of all ages , who sang the national anthem and waved the Peruvian flag . 
witch doctors joined in with wild dances around candles to exorcise evil spirits . 
Pope John Paul II added his voice to those requesting the hostages &apos; release . 
&quot; I ask that the Lord illuminates the minds and converts the hearts of those responsible for such a deplorable action , &quot; the Pontiff told pilgrims in Rome . 
President Alberto Fujimori has flatly rejected the demands of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) guerrillas , who seized the residence last Tuesday . 
dubbing them &quot; terrorists &quot; in a broadcast on Saturday night , the president told the rebels to lay down their arms and let all the hostages go if they wanted to avoid bloodshed . 
the government refused to allow fuel into the residence for the generator which provided power to the rebels and hostages since main electricity was cut off early in the siege . 
it ignored repeated demands to restore running water and telephone connections , too . 
there was no response by Sunday evening from the hostage-takers to Fujimori &apos;s ultimatum . 
however , a sign thrust to a residence window in the morning suggested that the government &apos;s stance might have torpedoed a further release of captives . 
&quot; The group is not moving because of the lack of fuel , &quot; it read . 
the crude handwritten sign was signed &quot; All the hostages . 
the chief mediator in the crisis , Red Cross official Michel Minnig , spent a sleepless night on Saturday with the captives but did not return to the residence on Sunday . 
a Red Cross official told Reuters that Minnig had spent the day with government officials , but no details of the talks were available . 
underlining the lack of progress , Japanese Foreign Minister Yakihiko Ikeda flew home to Tokyo on Sunday morning after three days of diplomacy which produced no clear result . 
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said in Japan that he backed Fujimori &apos;s hard line on the crisis , signalling an apparent shift from Tokyo &apos;s early enthusiasm for a softer tone with the hostage-takers . 
Cuba , which had been talked of as a possible refuge for the Marxist hostage-takers , remained silent . 
the Foreign Ministry said Havana had been following the crisis &quot; with special attention &quot; and keeping in permanent touch with Peruvian authorities but did not comment further . 
there was no new word either from MRTA leader Nestor Cerpa , the angry former textile worker who police say is leading the hostage-takers . 
speaking by radio from the residence on Saturday , a man claiming to be Cerpa promised that more hostages not connected to the government would be freed soon but said the fate of others depended on the government &apos;s posture . 
rebels have released more than 100 hostages since they stormed the compound during a cocktail party on Tuesday . 
all of the remaining hostages -- including at least seven ambassadors , two Peruvian cabinet ministers , top local officials and scores of Japanese businessmen -- are men . 
witnesses say at least two of the guerrillas are women . 
security sources say the government is weighing a military assault as one option to end the siege . 
however , the large number of hostages held , the residence &apos;s wealth of security features and the rebel snipers guarding it with rifles sporting telescopic night sights have acted as a strong deterrent .
