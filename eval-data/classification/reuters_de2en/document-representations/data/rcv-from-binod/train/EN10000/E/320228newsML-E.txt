Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer was quoted as saying in a newspaper interview that he saw German economic growth in 1997 at 2.0-2.5 percent , but added that cold winter weather may hold back the recovery in the first quarter of the year . 
&quot; I think we are on the way to recovery but we don &apos;t have enough of a self-supporting economic recovery yet , &quot; Tietmeyer was quoted by the International Herald Tribune as saying in a report published on Monday . 
Tietmeyer said in the interview that many European countries , including Germany , have faltered economically because they have been too slow to realise the need for reforms in order to match the rising power of Asia , the growth of Eastern Europe as a production base and the dynamic revival of the United States . 
he said governments should not link these urgently needed reforms with the introduction of a single European currency , but instead treat them as a crucial step for Europe to become more competitive in the world economy . 
the interview was conducted last week , the newspaper said .
