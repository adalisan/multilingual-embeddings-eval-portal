nine people , including three children , have died after eating poisonous mushrooms in northern Romania , state television said on Wednesday . 
doctors in a hospital in Baia Mare , near the border with Ukraine , told television that they had treated 62 cases of poisoning in the past two weeks . 
most of those affected were children . 
instances of poisoning occur regularly in post-Communist Romania , where hard-pressed consumers view mushroom picking either as a cheap way to feed their families or a chance to earn easy money at markets . 
Romanian television has in past years launched campaigns warning consumers to buy only mushrooms grown in greenhouses .
