the United States expressed disappointment on Friday over a decision by Russia &apos;s parliament to delay ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention and said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would raise the issue in Moscow next week . 
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Russia &apos;s government backed the treaty . 
he called on the Russian parliament , or Duma , to ratify it as soon as possible . 
&quot; We &apos;re extremely disappointed in the decision by the Duma to put off debate and consideration of this treaty until the fall , &quot; Burns told a news briefing . 
&quot; We think there &apos;s absolute good faith on the part of the Russian government . 
the Russian government has indicated it does want to go forward and we would hope that the Russian government and Duma can work out whatever concerns the Duma has , &quot; he added . 
Russia &apos;s parliament on Friday resisted international pressure to ratify the landmark treaty , saying it needed more time and Western cash to destroy its deadly stockpile . 
instead of approving the treaty , the Duma decided to send a statement to the other participating countries saying it would aim to ratify it in a few months &apos; time . 
Lev Fyodorov , president of the Russian Union for Chemical Security , said it would cost at least $ 5 billion to destroy the huge Russian stockpile of poison gas , the Interfax news agency reported . 
Russia and the United States possess the world &apos;s two largest chemical arsenals . 
on Thursday the U.S. Senate -- after considerable delay -- approved the pact . 
it has been signed by 164 countries and is due to take effect on Tuesday . 
&quot; We now hope , given the very decisive result in the Senate last night , that that message will be heard in Moscow , &quot; specifically by the Duma , Burns said . 
the 1993 treaty , which took years to negotiate , aims to ban the production , stockpiling , transfer and use of chemical weapons worldwide . 
the pact obliges members to eliminate all chemical weapons and production facilities by 2007 . 
China and Iran have signed but not ratified . 
non-signatories include Iraq and Libya . 
burns said the demand for more money was one that the Duma would have to address to the Russian government . 
Washington in the past has assisted the Soviet Union and then Russia with funds for chemical weapons destruction from the Nunn-Lugar programme adopted by Congress . 
burns said he believed &quot; there are sufficient ... monies from the international community , including the United States &quot; for this purpose . 
but he left the door open for possible further assistance , saying funding is &quot; an issue they ( members of the Duma ) should raise with the Russian government , and if the Russian government wants to raise it with us , we &apos;ll certainly listen . 
Albright will be in Moscow next Thursday for talks with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on NATO expansion plans . 
but Burns said the chemical weapons treaty will also be on the agenda . 
countries not ratifying by Tuesday when the treaty takes effect will not be eligible for membership in an executive council which sets rules for verification . 
so far 74 of the 164 states have ratified and the United States will be the 75th . 
burns said Russia would be disadvantaged by not being part of this decision-making group .
