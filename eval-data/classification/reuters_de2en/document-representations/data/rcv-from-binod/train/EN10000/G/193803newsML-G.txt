Italy &apos;s pension agency has thrown out a pension request by the mafia &apos;s jailed &quot; boss of bosses &quot; Salvatore Riina on grounds he made a fortune from a life dedicated to crime , his lawyer said on Friday . 
Riina , who is serving several life prison sentences , has said he is penniless and applied last year for a basic state pension of 370,000 lire ( $ 245 ) a month -- the minimum available -- shortly before his 65th birthday . 
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why they have turned down my request and why a pension is denied to me because I am jobless and I own nothing , &quot; Riina &apos;s lawyer , Piergiorgio Maffezzoli , quoted the mobster as saying in a Florence courtroom . 
Riina is currently on trial with 27 others for a string of bombings that hit Rome , Milan and Florence in 1993 . 
the mafia boss , who has always denied any wrongdoing , maintains he is a poor man struggling to make ends meet for himself and his family . 
police said in September they had unearthed a treasure trove of gold and precious jewels stashed away by Riina under the floor of an apartment in Sicily . 
the haul included up to 40 kg ( 90 lbs ) of gold bars , 300 gold sovereigns , several gold watches , diamonds , blank passports and a gem-encrusted crucifix that Riina may have worn at meetings of the Mafia &apos;s ruling &quot; commission &quot; . 
the authorities have also seized land and some 300 apartments , registered in the name of relatives , which they believe really belonged Riina , who was arrested in 1992 after 23 years on the run .
