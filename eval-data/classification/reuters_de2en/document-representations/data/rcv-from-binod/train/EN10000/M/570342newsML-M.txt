higher fuel oil prices in Asia and the United States buoyed European paper markets on Thursday but physical fuel trade was deadened by public holidays in the main trading countries , dealers said . 
high sulphur barge paper for May traded at $ 84.50 / $ 85.00 on the back of bullish sentiment in Singapore , where 180-cst grade was sold at $ 102 a tonne for May 26-30 delivery , up $ 2 on Tuesday , in anticipation of fresh demand . 
may Singapore swaps were also up , at $ 101.50 / $ 102.50 . 
stronger U.S. prices have also boosted one percent cracked swaps in Europe . 
but traders said it was unclear how much of the paper rise would filter through to physical markets . 
both cargo and barge markets were barely discussed , due to public holidays . 
low sulphur supplies were believed tight in the prompt period in northern Europe , though buyers were also relaxed after last week &apos;s flurry of deals . 
high sulphur cargoes were quiet in the north , though Mediterranean bunker requirements were rumoured filled earlier this week in secretive trades . 
a 25kt low sulphur straight-run deal was heard done on Tuesday from an Irish to a European refiner . 
the price was undisclosed . 
but other straight-run sellers were quiet and Russian fuel oil was still in short supply .
