France &apos;s Communists came in from the cold in Sunday &apos;s parliamentary election , boosting their representation in the National Assembly , but it was unclear whether they would join a left-wing government . 
as the results of a stunning left-wing victory came in , the Communists were seen winning 36 of the assembly &apos;s 577 seats , up from 24 in the last poll four years ago . 
leader Robert Hue , who has renovated the party &apos;s image by dropping its Stalinist line , promptly said he was ready to discuss Communists joining a left-wing government . 
&quot; Thirty-six deputies are going to carry weight , &quot; he said . 
but there was no certainty they would be needed as their Socialist partners and other left-wing allies were close to an absolute majority that would spare them from depending on Communist support in parliament . 
&quot; The Communist Party &apos;s approach aims at participating in the government of France ... We will do our duty , &quot; said Hue , keen to seize on the election performance to boost the Communists &apos; role despite misgivings within their own leadership . 
the defeated right had used the Communist &quot; threat &quot; as a major argument to avoid a return to the past . 
but a Sofres opinion poll of voters on Sunday showed a narrow 49-46 percent majority in favour of Communists joining a left-wing cabinet . 
hue said he had made policy proposals to Socialist leader Lionel Jospin who is expected to be named prime minister and share power with conservative President Jacques Chirac . 
in last-minute pre-election talks with Jospin , Hue had set conditions for joining a cabinet , including a rapid rise in salaries and a new tax on investment income . 
Jospin has said his cabinet would include ministers from various parties in order to reflect the election alliance between Socialists , Communists and Greens . 
but aides have said he would not accept any conditions from the Communists . 
the Communists are divided on whether they should join a Socialist-led cabinet , support it from outside , or remain on the sidelines and back it on a case-by-case basis . 
both Socialists and Communists want to make employment the top priority , cutting the work week to create jobs and boosting purchasing power to revive the economy . 
but they disagree on the pace of change , with the Socialists favouring gradual steps . 
they also disagree on European monetary union , which the Communists oppose but the Socialists favour provided it is geared towards growth and jobs . 
the party &apos;s old guard , once burned twice shy , remember how serving in a Socialist government as minority partners in 1981-84 precipitated the French Communists &apos; decline . 
&quot; The Communists must be in a left-wing government ... but , if we don &apos;t rapidly get sufficient assurances we &apos;ll be in the majority but not in the cabinet , &quot; Hue said last week after hardliner Alain Bocquet , claiming wide support within the party , said Communists should stay outside the cabinet . 
if asked to join the cabinet , the Communists will make their decision after consulting grassroots party members . 
older Communists recall how the late Socialist president Francois Mitterrand precipitated their party &apos;s rapid decline . 
elected in 1981 on a joint platform of the left , Mitterrand appointed four Communist ministers with the portfolios of transport , public service , professional training and health . 
they walked out three years later , after Mitterrand dropped expansionary policies for austerity and monetary orthodoxy . 
it was too late . 
voters held the party co-responsible for the belt-tightening , and the Communists &apos; score in parliamentary elections dropped from 16.1 percent in 1981 to 9.7 percent five years later , a far cry from their 25 percent in the early 1970s . 
they fell to an all-time low of 5.5 percent in the 1988 presidential poll and six percent in a 1993 parliamentary rout . 
hue , who took over in 1994 from hardliner Georges Marchais , has stopped the electoral decline . 
a jovial judo black belt and former medical orderly , he gave the party a new image after the Soviet Union collapsed . 
repudiating the Marchais legacy , he called eastern Europe &apos;s fallen regimes a perversion of communism and attracted disgruntled Socialists by harping on France &apos;s widening inequalities and record unemployment . 
hue polled 7.6 percent of the votes in the presidential election two years ago and the Communists won 9.9 percent in last week &apos;s first round of the parliamentary election .
