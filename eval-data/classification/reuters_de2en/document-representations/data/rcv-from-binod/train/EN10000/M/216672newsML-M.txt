rates for 70,000 tonne dirty tankers making upcoast U.S. voyages from the Caribbean were firm again on Tuesday as charterers sought scarce tonnage , shipping brokers said . 
one broker assessed rates for these vessels sailing on these routes as high as W140 , adding that lightering and cancellations were having a strong impact on the market . 
&quot; charterers are scrambling for scarce tonnage , &quot; he said . 
rates for two million barrel vessels moving to the U.S. Gulf from West Africa were flat at around W65 , with supply and demand for tonnage seen roughly in balance . 
but 130,000 tonne Suezmax vessels making the voyage were relatively scarce for the next two weeks with newer ships asking a premium to older vessels . 
new ships were talked at W105 , slightly firmer from last week . 
North Sea markets were healthy , as another large vessel , the 278,000 tonne Hellespont Orpheum , was fixed from Norway to the U.S. Gulf for mid-December at a bullish W70 . 
&quot; But it is all a question of dates . 
transatlantic rates for Suezmaxes had changed little since Monday &apos;s fixture of the 136,000 tonne Tromso Confidence at W105 . 
Mediterranean rates were little changed , and brokers said delays at Skikda because of bad weather were localised and had not had an effect on rates . 
Mideast / Japan routes for very large crude carriers ( VLCCs ) were unchanged at W65 or more , with adequate tonnage seen available , while Mideast / Singapore was talked close to W60 . 
Stentex &apos;s fixture of the VLCC Moscliff from Mideast to Singapore or Thailand at W57.5 was seen a little below market because of the age of the ship .
