the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping leaves Communist Party chief and state President Jiang Zemin as unquestionably the most powerful man in China . 
but a number of other figures already in prominent positions or waiting in the wings are forces to be reckoned with -- or may aspire to eventually assume Deng &apos;s mantle . 
they are : 
born 1928 . 
present position - Premier . 
Li Peng has been China &apos;s most tenacious premier since his adoptive father , the respected Zhou Enlai , and a key member of the team supposed to guide China into the 21st century . 
he is also China &apos;s most unpopular leader , hated for his role as the frontman in the suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators around Beijing &apos;s Tiananmen Square in June , 1989 . 
&quot; He is rigid , with no sense of humour whatever , &quot; said a Western political analyst . 
however , the hardliner has overseen a government that nurtured the fastest economic boom on earth -- and tried to soften his image by travelling around China kissing babies , smiling with his wife at his side and shaking countless hands . 
born 1924 . 
present position - head of parliament . 
Qiao Shi , the shadowy figure who once led China &apos;s security apparatus , has overseen a drive to boost the powers of the rubber-stamp National People &apos;s Congress , China &apos;s parliament . 
once tipped as a possible head of the Communist Party , Qiao -- a close ally of Deng Xiaoping -- has been content to remain relatively in the shadows . 
but as the man who ultimately kept the files on everyone in China , he wields enormous inflence and power , analysts said . 
&quot; An outwardly serious , taciturn person , he is generally regarded as steady , competent and far-sighted , &quot; reported an official biography , which said the non-smoker and non-drinker worked 10 hours each day . 
born 1928 . 
present position - Vice Premier . 
Zhu Rongji , China &apos;s vice premier charged with running the world &apos;s fastest growing economy , has been called &quot; China &apos;s Gorbachev &quot; for his strong reformist streak -- and hates the nickname . 
Zhu is China &apos;s chief troubleshooter , charged with fixing all the ills afflicting the economy from inflation to bankrupt state enterprises , from angry farmers to corrupt financiers . 
Zhu is among the most visible members of the successor generation to Deng Xiaoping . 
but whether the acerbic former mayor of Shanghai can keep his favoured position depends on his ability to juggle the many tasks he has been handed . 
&quot; Zhu has so much on his plate it shows how shallow their pool of talent is , &quot; said a Western diplomat . 
born 1907 . 
present position - retired . 
former president Yang Shangkun was a military strongman who tried , and failed , to use his connections in the armed forces and close ties to Deng Xiaoping to take supreme power . 
Yang was regarded in the late 1980s and early 1990s as the number two in China and the most likely power broker to emerge when Deng died . 
however , his ambitions and his formation of a power base through his army connections created many enemies and finally angered even Deng , who pushed him into retirement at the end of his five-year term as president in 1993 . 
Yang played a crucial role in suppressing pro-democracy demonstrations that swept China in the spring of 1989 . 
born 1902 . 
present position - retired . 
Peng Zhen , a veteran hardliner and close associate of Deng Xiaoping , wielded enormous behind-the-scenes power after leaving his official posts . 
Mayor of Beijing for 15 years , Peng still appears occasionally , sometimes in a wheelchair , appearing lively , alert and a force to be reckoned with into his late 90s . 
he commanded a vast network of connections built up after years in the party hierarchy and as chairman of parliament , the National People &apos;s Congress . 
he has been a particularly vociferous promoter of Deng &apos;s campaign against &quot; bourgeois liberalisation &quot; -- Chinese jargon for Western ideas . 
present position - disgraced . 
Zhao Ziyang pioneered bold economic reform in China but was dragged down in a crisis sparked by popular demands for parallel political freedoms . 
at one time considered heir-apparent to Deng Xiaoping , Zhao became Communist Party leader in November 1987 at the party &apos;s 13th congress , when many veteran revolutionaries retired from top posts . 
a bare 18 months later , those same old men -- fearful of the social changes Zhao &apos;s reforms had triggered -- re-emerged to back hardliners demanding his overthrow . 
during the 1989 student-led protests around Tiananmen Square , Zhao , with tears in his eyes , beseeched student leaders to end the demonstrations that were subsequently crushed by the military .
