North Korea stepped up its war of words against South Korea on Thursday , saying Seoul &apos;s recent amphibious war games were a &quot; kind of declaration of war &quot; . 
&quot; This war exercise by the puppets ( South Korea ) is clearly a kind of declaration of war and can never be tolerated , &quot; said the Rodong Shinmun , mouthpiece of North Korea &apos;s ruling party . 
the newspaper commentary , carried on state-run Radio Pyongyang and monitored by Japan &apos;s Radiopress news agency , accused Seoul of dangerous provocation and said South Korea &apos;s amphibious war games were clearly directed against North Korea . 
Thursday &apos;s commentary followed a warning from North Korea &apos;s 1.1-million strong military on Wednesday that the armed forces were ready for a &quot; final battle &quot; with the United States and South Korea . 
in a rare statement , a North Korean military spokesman said the recent South Korean amphibious exercises on islands near the North , as well as other U.S. exercises , showed that Seoul and Washington were set to strike while the famine-stricken North was weak . 
Thursday &apos;s commentary lambasted South Korea once again over the exercises . 
&quot; In the last decade or so , South Korea has camouflaged invasion exercises as &apos; defensive manoeuvres &apos; , &quot; it said . 
&quot; But this time , the ( South Korean President ) Kim Young-sam group openly declared that this was a war exercise to land on the beaches of our republic ( North Korea ) . 
the Rodong Shinmun added : &quot; If the puppets and their American imperialist masters provoke an aggressive war , our people and the People &apos;s Army will reply with a hundred-fold , thousand-fold defeat against them . 
following Wednesday &apos;s statement from the North Korean military , the South Korean Defence Ministry denied stepping up military exercises . 
Seoul officials instead accused North Korea of trying to justify its huge military spending by whipping up war threats . 
North Korea-watchers in Japan and South Korea have said Pyongyang &apos;s tough words were part of a long-term brinkmanship strategy aimed at securing closer ties with the United States and raising the North &apos;s international profile at the expense of rival South Korea . 
in New York , North Korean delegates have been holding preliminary negotiations at the working level with their counterparts from South Korea and the United States in the run-up to four-party peace talks which would also include China . 
the proposed peace talks aim to achieve a permanent treaty to replace the fraying armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War .
