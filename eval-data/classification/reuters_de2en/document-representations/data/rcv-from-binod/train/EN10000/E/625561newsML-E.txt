the U.S. economy is expected to slow from a sizzling 5.8 percent growth rate in the first quarter to more sustainable levels by the second half of the year , a top Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City official said . 
&quot; We &apos;re expecting growth to slow to potential growth by the second half of the year , &quot; Craig Hakkio , director of research at the Kansas City Fed , told Reuters in an interview . 
he said the cooling of the economy was expected to be across the board , adding that no specific sector would lead the way . 
&quot; It &apos;s sort of a slowing across the board . 
I don &apos;t see it being one sector leading the way , &quot; Hakkio said . 
the Kansas City Fed official said he believed the slowdown would spread its wings among several sectors of the economy , including retail sales , consumer spending , fixed business investments and housing . 
Hakkio pointed out , however , the expected cooling did not imply the Federal Reserve was forecasting the economy would be crawling by the end of the year . 
&quot; Let me emphasize that we &apos;re talking slowing from 5.8 ( percent ) to something more sustainable . 
&quot; I &apos;m not talking about slowing to something that &apos;s a concern to the economy in terms of recession or 1.0 percent growth . 
it &apos;s a slowing from a very high growth rate and not to a worrisome level , &quot; Hakkio said . 
although the economy has entered its seventh consecutive year of expansion , Hakkio said he believes there is still some pent-up demand left among consumers . 
&quot; We do have something left ( in terms of pent-up demand ) . 
Hakkio said inflation continues to be a missing person , but acknowledged that the risks of price rises remain on the upside . 
&quot; I think there &apos;s still an upside risk of greater inflation , but at this point we don &apos;t see it , &quot; he said . 
the Kansas City Fed director said employment costs remain relatively under control despite tighteness in Labor markets . 
he said , however , he has noticed a small increase in overall compensation . 
but , he added , it was still too early to predict if such a phenomenon indicated the beginning of a trend . 
&quot; We &apos;re seeing a slight pick-up in wages and salaries and a very modest increase in compensation . 
&quot; But ... at this point it is so difficult to distinguish whether this is a fundamental increase in the rate of Labor compensation or whether it &apos;s just a quarter-to-quarter bloat , &quot; Hakkio said . 
the Kansas City Fed official said he uses a whole set of tools when trying to assess the current state of the economy . 
those tools include concepts like the Non-Accelarating Inflation Rate of Unemployment ( NAIRU ) and indicators such as capacity utilization , health care costs and interest rates in the futures market . 
the economist said , however , he did not find the NAIRU to be a suitable gauge of future inflation . 
&quot; I think the concept of the NAIRU makes sense , &quot; he said , but added that the lack of consensus among economists on where the NAIRU is in a given period , &quot; makes it difficult to use it as an indicator of future inflation . 
forecasts from Wall Street economists currently put the NAIRU in a wide range between 5.0 and 6.0 percent . 
&quot; With the NAIRU changing over time , it &apos;s more difficult to use it as a tool for forcasting inflation trends , &quot; Hakkio said .
