double Olympic gold medallist Svetlana Masterkova is doubtful for next month &apos;s world indoor championships in Paris but Russia &apos;s selectors still expect a good medal haul . 
&quot; The Russian team is quite capable of taking second place in Paris ( in the medal standings ) and winning three or four golds , &quot; Russian Athletics Federation general secretary Vadim Zelichenok told Reuters . 
Russia , who hold their national indoor championships in Volgograd next weekend , expect to field a powerful squad of between 30 and 35 for the March 7-9 championships . 
but they will be without Olympic silver medallist Igor Trandenkov in the pole vault and may also be deprived of Masterkova , gold medallist in the 800 and 1,500 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games . 
Trandenkov has had a knee operation and Masterkova is still in need of rest after a hectic season last year , Zelichenok said . 
but indoor sprint specialist Irina Privalova , who ran a year &apos;s best 7.02 seconds over 60 metres at Lievin , France , on Sunday and 7.08 on Tuesday in Moscow , has her sights on both that distance and the 200 metres in Paris . 
the indoor heptathlon team will get a boost from the defection to Moscow of Ukrainian decathlete Lev Lobodin , bronze medallist in the 1994 European championships . 
&quot; It &apos;s a great present for us since it &apos;s been a long time since we &apos;ve had good results in the multi-discipline events , &quot; Zelichenok said . 
&quot; We very much hope that Lobodin can bring his new team a medal in Paris . 
Lobodin had long complained about poor training facilities in Ukraine . 
he pulled out of the 1995 world indoor event in Barcelona in frustration at being unable to prepare properly . 
Zelichenok admitted that Russian athletics , too , was still suffering from the post-Soviet financial crisis . 
the team was unable to hold its normal winter training camp in southern Russian this year . 
the prize money at Tuesday &apos;s international indoor meet in Moscow was cut by a third from last year . 
&quot; Now , though , the situation is starting to change for the better , &quot; Zelichenok said .
