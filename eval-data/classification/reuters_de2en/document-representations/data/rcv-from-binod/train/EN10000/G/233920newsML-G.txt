Lefist guerrillas dragged two off-duty soldiers from a public bus and executed them at the side of the road in northeast Colombia , officials said on Wednesday . 
national Liberation Army ( ELN ) rebels held up the bus near the town of Hato Corozal in Casanare province on Tuesday . 
they ordered the two soldiers , members of a counterinsurgency battalion , to get out and riddled them with 9 mm bullets in view of other passengers , a police spokesman said . 
in neighbouring Arauca province , seven soldiers were injured in an ELN grenade attack . 
and in northern Santander province , three officers suffered shrapnel wounds in a firefight with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) , the country &apos;s largest rebel army . 
Arauca has been the scene of intense rebel activity in recent days . 
the ELN dynamited sections of the country &apos;s main oil pipeline that run through the province on Sunday and Monday and prevented engineers carrying out emergency repairs . 
&quot; The ELN have been staging a series of terrorist attacks to create the impression that it is a major force in the area , which have put the civilian population at risk , &quot; a government spokesman said . 
in addition to stepping up attacks against the military in northeastern Colombia in recent days , the ELN announced it was planning to submit some local officials to &quot; people &apos;s trials . 
in a communique published by some local media on Wednesday , it admitted responsibility for kidnapping Maria Helena Molina , town mayor of Tame , late last month , and said she would be put on political trial before being released .
