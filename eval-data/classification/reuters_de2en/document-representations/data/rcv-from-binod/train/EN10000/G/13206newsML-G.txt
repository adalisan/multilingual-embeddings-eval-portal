Singapore prime minister Goh Chok Tong on Sunday quashed speculation of an early general election in the city-state , saying there would be no polls before the end of October . 
asked by journalists about comments he was reported to have made at a National Day dinner on Saturday evening , Goh confirmed saying he now only had four possible &quot; windows &quot; for the elections , all of them after October . 
that is that you can go on leave in October . 
in July , Goh said there were five windows in which the election could be held : September , November , December , during the Chinese Lunar New Year in February 1997 and after the budget debate in March . 
there is no legal requirement to elect a new parliament until April 1997 , but Goh &apos;s unbeaten People &apos;s Action Party ( PAP ) usually calls elections long before they are due . 
Goh hinted he may wait until the last possible moment to hold elections . 
&quot; If you remember back in 1991 , I said I would go the full term and people seem to have forgotten that -- and full-term means a good five years , &quot; he said , adding , &quot; If I feel the time is right , then I will call the election . 
speculation over the exact date of the election has been mounting since Goh &apos;s announcement on August 18 that the election would be &quot; soon &quot; . 
but a recent spate of poor economic news has encouraged some economists to suggest the polls may be postponed . 
two weeks ago , Singapore announced a sharp decline in its economic growth in the second quarter , to seven percent from 10.9 percent a year ago , which officials said was due to a slump in its key electronics market . 
as a result , most economists have cut their growth forecasts for the third quarter and many suggest a real turnaround may not occur until the beginning of 1997 . 
commenting on the economic slowdown , Goh said he was cautiously optimistic . 
&quot; The downturn is felt in the electronics industry , which of course then would have some influence on maybe the financial sector , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It is difficult to say how long it will last . 
the downturn has come very suddenly and more sharply than people expected . 
we are dealing with a very volatile industry . 
three months , six months , that is possible .
