India &apos;s ruling United Front coalition asked the rebellious Congress party on Wednesday to start talks to resolve an 11-day-old political crisis , raising expectations of an agreement to avert mid-term polls . 
&quot; We expect the talks to start in the course of the day , &quot; United Front spokesman Jaipal Reddy said . 
news that the two sides were preparing for talks raised hopes that they could resolve their differences before a vote of confidence in parliament set for Friday . 
the Bombay bourse &apos;s benchmark index was up 84.90 points , or 2.41 percent , at 3,605.39 points at 1 p.m. ( 0730 GMT ) , buoyed by hopes that an end to the political turmoil could pave the way to parliamentary passage of an investor-friendly budget . 
the budget , which would slash corporate and personal income tax rates , has been held hostage by the political uncertainty . 
Congress party president Sitaram Kesri sparked the crisis last month when he announced the withdrawal of his party &apos;s vital support for DEVE Gowda &apos;s minority centre-left coalition . 
but on Tuesday , Kesri said he was willing to hold talks with the United Front , and wanted &quot; respect , not power &quot; . 
the alliance named a three-member panel for the talks , comprised of Harkishan Singh Surjeet , general secretary of the Communist Party of India-Marxist , Jammu and Kashmir state Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah and Andhra Pradesh state Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu , United Front officials said . 
Kesri has demanded that DEVE Gowda , who assumed power last June after inconclusive general elections , step down . 
but the United Front has resisted the demand . 
&quot; There will be no change in the leadership of the government , &quot; a United Front official said . 
&quot; There is no question of changing the prime minister . 
United Front spokesman Reddy declined to comment on the leadership question when asked if the coalition would agree to drop DEVE Gowda . 
the United Front lacks an outright majority in the lower house of parliament and depends on Congress to survive a challenge by the rightwing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) . 
speculation has centred on a possible reconciliation between the United Front and Congress , neither of which wants snap elections which could strengthen the BJP . 
but a United Front official said the alliance did not want Congress , which has supported the government without holding any cabinet portfolios , to enter the ruling coalition . 
&quot; We have decided that Congress will not be a part of the governing coalition , &quot; the United Front told reporters at the end of a special meeting of the alliance &apos;s decision-making Steering Committee at DEVE Gowda &apos;s official residence . 
Congress president Sitaram Kesri was locked in talks with senior party officials to consider their position ahead of the confidence vote . 
while Congress maintained silence over the likely outcome of the talks , United Front leaders and some opposition parties saw the possibility of a patch-up before the confidence vote . 
&quot; The United Front and the Congress are in a tight corner , &quot; said George Fernandes , whose Samta Party is an ally of the BJP . 
they will wriggle out of the crisis . 
United Front politician Sharad Yadav said he was expecting a positive outcome before the vote .
