German Vice Chancellor Klaus Kinkel arrived in India on Thursday and said he hoped more could be done to bring home a German tourist kidnapped 18 months ago in Kashmir . 
Kinkel , who is also the foreign minister , was asked as he entered talks with Indian Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral if more could be done to gain the release of German Dirk Hasert , who was taken hostage in July 1995 with three other Westerners . 
Kinkel was scheduled to meet the chief minister of troubled Jammu and Kashmir state , Farooq Abdullah , later on Thursday . 
Indian and Western officials are not sure whether Hasert , American Donald Hutchings and Britons Keith Mangan and Paul Wells are dead or alive after being captured by separatist militants . 
Kinkel was set to meet Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma and Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda on Thursday . 
Gujral was asked by Reuters before his meeting with Kinkel if he would ask for Germany &apos;s support for India &apos;s desire to become a permanent member of United Nations Security Council . 
Kinkel told reporters he was prepared to spell out Germany &apos;s stand towards India &apos;s drive to become a permanent Security Council member after his talks . 
Kinkel , who is on a three-day visit to India , is accompanied by a high-level German business delegation .
