tiger Woods , exhausted by his chase after full PGA Tour playing privileges , announced Wednesday he was withdrawing from the $ 1 million Buick Challenge at Callaway gardens which starts Thursday . 
&quot; The past five weeks have been the most challenging of my life -- and at the same time , the most physically and emotionally draining , &quot; the celebrated 20-year-old golfer said in the statement issued through his business agents . 
Woods turned professional after winning an unprecedented third consecutive U.S. 
amateur championship in August and set his sights on earning enough money in the remaining U.S. Tour events to qualify for all of next season &apos;s tournaments . 
&quot; I have played well for the most part , but even then , being in contention resulted in more strain than I anticipated . 
playing the last four PGA events , Woods has won $ 140,194 in prize money to vault into 128th place on the earnings list , just three spots shy of where he needs to be to automatically earn his PGA Tour card for 1996 . 
still , Woods has effectively guaranteed his presence on the 1997 tour since any player in the top 150 can benefit from unlimited sponsor exemptions . 
Woods &apos;s third-place tie last week at the rain-shortened $ 1 million BC Open at the En-Joie Golf Club in Endicott , New York netted him $ 58,000 . 
&quot; I came here fully intending to play in the Buick Challenge , &quot; the statement said . 
I am going to rest for the remainder of this week , and I hope and plan to be back next week in Las Vegas . 
Woods , who also won the national collegiate championship last year at Stanford , added : &quot; withdrawing from a tournament at the last minute is not something that I am accustomed to doing . 
I have expressed my apologies and my regrets to the officials of the Buick Challenge .
