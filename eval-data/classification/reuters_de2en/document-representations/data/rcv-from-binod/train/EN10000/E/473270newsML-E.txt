lawmakers in Washington state &apos;s House of Representatives unveiled a $ 19 billion state spending plan on Wednesday that includes $ 378 million of tax relief . 
the budget blueprint for the 1997-1999 biennium also leaves more than half a billion dollars in reserve , much more than the state Senate or Washington &apos;s Democratic governor had proposed . 
&quot; We are spending money others have earned , and we have an obligation to ensure they get their money &apos;s worth on every nickel , or they get it back , &quot; House appropriations Chairman Tom huff said of the budget . 
the House budget , which includes $ 378 million of tax relief , lowers business tax rates on professional services hit by a tax increase in 1993 . 
the budget also presumes voter passage in November of a permanent cut in property taxes . 
the priorities outlined in the House budget track closely with the previously announced spending blueprints from the governor and the Republican-controlled state Senate . 
the House funds a 3.3 percent increase in enrollments at community colleges and four-year universities , and increases financial aid to students in both public and private colleges . 
cuts fall most heavily in the area of social services . 
House Republicans expect able-bodied welfare recipients to contribute toward their monthly health insurance premiums . 
&quot; While I &apos;m encouraged the legislature has put a priority on education , the tough work now begins , &quot; said Democratic Gov. 
Gary Locke . 
&quot; We have tough choices within the same dollar amounts we all propose . 
the House general operating budget is tentatively scheduled for a vote on Monday . 
State House staff are still working on a $ 1.8 billion state construction budget and a transportation budget , neither expected before next week . 
earlier Wednesday , the Senate narrowly approved its $ 19.1 billion budget for the biennium . 
the Senate plan includes a reserve of $ 370 million and $ 500 million in tax relief . 
Locke has proposed a $ 19.2 billion budget for 1997-1999 that calls for a reserve of $ 304 million and provides $ 311 million in tax reductions for homeowners and businesses . 
these varying budget proposals will eventually be submitted to a so-called conference committee that will iron out their differences .
