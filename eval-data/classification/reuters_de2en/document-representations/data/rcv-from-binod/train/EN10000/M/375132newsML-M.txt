Croatian stocks posted new losses in brisker trade on Thursday , but analysts expected the market to stabilise after what they saw as its reaction to tighter controls on foreign investment imposed by nearby Slovenia . 
foreign portfolio investors face no restrictions in Croatia , but were said to be cautious after the neighbouring country &apos;s decision . 
&quot; Prices have automatically slipped down a bit , but we are still far away from what has happened in Slovenia , &quot; said Josko Milisa of I.F.C brokerage . 
he expected the market to stabilise within the next few days . 
&quot; ( Fully-listed ) Zagrebacka Banka and ( drugs firm ) Pliva are making their recovery in London , &quot; he said , adding that this should pull their Zagreb prices and the whole market up . 
Pliva was Thursday &apos;s most active issue on volume of 4,511 shares and one of the two sole gainers , adding five kuna to 475 . 
its GDRs fetched $ 16.725 in London , up from $ 16.1 on Wednesday . 
nine of 13 other active issues fell and two were flat . 
volume slightly rose to 9,503 shares and turnover was also higher at five million kuna . 
Zagrebacka lost 50 kuna to 1,800 but it sold only four shares . 
its GDRs rose to $ 30.75 from $ 29.725 on Seaq International . 
however , Milisa expected trading to slow down in the near future , as the country prepares for local elections scheduled for April 13 . 
&quot; It is a normal reaction . 
volume of trading and prices always shrink amid the usual uncertainty clouding elections . 
hotelier Istraturist was the biggest gainer on Thursday , adding 13 kuna to 228 , with 51 shares sold . 
all other active hotel stocks inched down a few kuna , selling several hundred shares . 
top decliner cable maker Elka lost 20 kuna to 160 , selling 100 units . 
food processor Podravka was also on the losing side , falling 10 kuna to 320 on volume of 2,186 units . 
&quot; Foreign investors were taken aback by Slovenia &apos;s decision and are now halting buy orders for Podravka , &quot; Milisa said , adding it could now trade on smaller volumes . 
the Zagreb Stock Exchange said on Thursday it had delisted ailing Privredna Banka to prevent trade in its stock while the bank is being recapitalised . 
Privredna was the top gainer last Thursday , selling over 7,000 shares .
