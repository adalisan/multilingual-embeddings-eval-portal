following is the China Interbank offered Rate ( CHIBOR ) for Wednesday issued by the official Xinhua news agency on behalf of the People &apos;s Bank of China , the central bank . 
the figures represent weighted averages and not closing prices and are annual percentage rates . 
turnover fell slightly to 1.911 billion yuan from 2.09 billion yuan with the 30-day contract the most actively traded . 
trading was more active than the daily average of the past few weeks partly due to a news report that the market had admitted securities brokerages , including Shenyin and Wanguo Securities , as second-tier memebers , traders said . 
the Shanghai Securities News said the market had allowed some securities houses to be regular participants trading through the short-term financial centres , money brokages run by the central bank , who are first-tier members . 
a spokesman for the Shanghai branch of the People &apos;s Bank , the central bank , said that the brokerages were not newly admitted but had recently been re-registered . 
&quot; The market expects the brokerages to trade more after the re-registration , which will help boost trading , &quot; said a trader . 
&quot; This sentiment pushed the trading volume up relatively high today , &quot; he added . 
traders said they expected the rates to move narrowly in the short term due to a lack of market-moving news .
