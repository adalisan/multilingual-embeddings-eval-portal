Zimbabwe &apos;s industrial shares powered ahead on Tuesday as investor sentiment continued to be boosted by the release of data showing a further fall in annual inflation in August . 
but some brokers forecast they would slow down soon for a price correction . 
the key industrial index leapt 61.75 points to close at a new level of 7,176.55 . 
&quot; The fall in inflation certainly adds to the buying frenzy . 
however , the market is now beginning to show that it &apos;s overpriced with some buyers resisting the prices . 
so the bull-run might slow down soon but the market will continue firm , &quot; one broker said . 
Zimbabwe &apos;s year-on-year consumer price index stood at a three-year low of 17.7 percent in August from 22 percent in July , according to statistics released by the Central Statistical Office on Monday . 
local economic analysts were surprised by the low August figure which many of them said they had expected to rise on the back of a spate of energy and milk price increases . 
on the stock market on Tuesday , tobacco firm BAT surged 250 cents to 1,300 , merchant bankers FMB leapt 150 cents to 3,500 , tyre manufacturer NTS and packaging firm Hunyani rose 50 cents each to 550 and 400 respectively . 
clothing retailer Truworths gained 30 cents to 800 , textiler Spinweave at 170 and multi-industrial group apex at 150 both climbed 20 cents , while transport group at 180 , tobacco group TSL at 520 , sugar producer Hippo at 850 and hotel chain Zimsun at 435 all put on 10 cents .
