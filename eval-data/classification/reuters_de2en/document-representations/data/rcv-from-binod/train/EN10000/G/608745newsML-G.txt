Slovenia &apos;s parliament agreed on Friday to bring national legislation into line with European Union standards , taking the country one step closer to final ratification of its association agreement with the EU . 
parliamentary parties agreed to adopt legislation that would allow a gradual liberalisation of Slovenian markets , including real estate , while protecting national interests in accordance with EU norms . 
last week parliament postponed a session on ratifying the accord , which was signed last June , to give political parties more time to reach a broader agreement on the issue . 
under the terms of the association agreement , Slovenia undertook to change its constitution to allow foreigners to own property within four years of the treaty taking effect . 
before voting on ratification the assembly has to wait for the Constitutional Court to say whether Slovenia can ratify the treaty without immediate changes to its constitution . 
the court is expected to decide on the issue at the latest on June 5 . 
European Commission President Jacques Santer said in April a speedy ratification was essential if Slovenia wanted to be among the first nations to start talks on full EU membership , probably in early 1998 .
