heredity may determine whether people feel good or bad when they use marijuana , and the same genetic influence might also apply to alcohol and cocaine , U.S. scientists reported on Friday . 
&quot; The finding that genetic factors contribute to how an individual feels after using marijuana opens new avenues for prevention and treatment research , &quot; said Dr. Alan Leshner , director of the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse , which funded the marijuana study . 
in the research , male identical twins were found more likely than non-identical male twins to report similar responses to marijuana use . 
identical twins share all the same genes ; fraternal twins share about half . 
more than 600 pairs of twins who reported using marijuana more than five times were asked if they experienced each of 23 possible reactions , ranging from confused or paranoid to relaxed or mellow , after marijuana use . 
the study found that those who responded positively tended to use the drug more often , but the reactions to marijuana were more similar for identical twins than fraternal twins . 
this led the study &apos;s authors to believe that genes may control individuals &apos; responses to the drug . 
the study &apos;s authors also believe their finding might apply to the use of other substances such as alcohol and cocaine , the institute said in a statement . 
the specific gene that influences response to marijuana could not be identified in this study .
