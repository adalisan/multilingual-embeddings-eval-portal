accused Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski has been ordered to appear in person at an arraignment next month on murder charges in New Jersey , his attorney said Thursday . 
Kaczynski is accused of a 1994 mail bombing that killed a New Jersey advertising executive . 
his defence attorneys rejected a court proposal that he appear at his New Jersey arraignment via a closed-circuit teleconference , said U.S. Public defender John McMahon . 
the teleconference had been proposed as a way to avoid an expensive , high-security trip to transport Kaczynski to New Jersey from California , where he is being held without bail . 
the decision was made by Kaczynski &apos;s attorneys in California and no explanation was given , McMahon said . 
the attorneys could not be reached immediately for comment . 
the arraignment is scheduled for Dec . 10 in U.S. District Court in Newark before Judge Dickinson Debevoise , who issued the court order , said McMahon . 
Kaczynski , a former mathematics professor turned recluse , is accused of a string of mail-bomb attacks that killed three people and injured 23 others over several years . 
he was arrested in April at his one-room cabin in rural Montana and is awaiting trial on federal murder charges in California . 
he was indicted in New Jersey on charges that he mailed the parcel bomb that killed Thomas Mosser on Dec . 10 , 1994 at his home in North Caldwell , N.J. 
Kaczynski allegedly transported the bomb from Montana to San Francisco , where he mailed it . 
when Mosser opened the package , it exploded and killed him instantly . 
the suspected bomber is not scheduled to stand trial in New Jersey until the California case is completed .
