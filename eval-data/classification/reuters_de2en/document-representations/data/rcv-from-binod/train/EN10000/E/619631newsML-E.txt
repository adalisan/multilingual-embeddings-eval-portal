Malawi &apos;s economy will grow by at least seven percent in 1997 , the country &apos;s finance minister , Aleke Banda , said on Wednesday . 
Banda made the forecast at a seminar on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the African Development Bank . 
he said the country &quot; was in tatters &quot; when the democratic government took over in May 1994 , with inflation at 100 percent , interest rates at 70 percent and negative growth . 
within less than two years inflation had been slashed to seven percent , and economic growth rates of 9.5 percent and nine percent were recorded in 1995 and 1996 respectively . 
&quot; During the course of this year , we expect a growth rate of at least seven percent , &quot; Banda said .
