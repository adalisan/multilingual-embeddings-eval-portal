the picturesque hills of this landlocked Central African country appear at first glance at peace , dotted with houses roofed with red terracotta tiles . 
but this is the deception of northern Burundi , where even the children , some only slightly taller than the goats they herd , are potential recruits for Hutu rebels or the Tutsi-led army . 
along the road are people , few of them old , suspicious at the noise of vehicles -- afraid they bring violence or death . 
Hutu rebels use the hills as their sanctuary from the Tutsi-dominated army , rushing down when the way is clear to ambush traffic on the roads and fleeing back before the army arrives . 
more than 150,000 people have been killed in Burundi in massacres and the civil war between the army and rebels since the assassination of the country &apos;s first Hutu president in 1993 . 
tiny squares of crops are patchwork on the lines of hills , which cascade to the horizon in the morning haze . 
women wrapped from head to toe in brightly coloured cloth work single patches of red earth too small to support a family . 
others walk with hoes on their shoulders past sweating boys berating grey and brown goats and long-horned cattle in long grass lining the road southwards from the border with Rwanda . 
men on bicycles wobble along with women sitting side-saddle on their carriers , before swerving out of the way of a beer truck which farther along the road is stopped at a checkpoint . 
civilians and some soldiers man the checkpoint , marked by a flimsy thin rope with rags dangling from it , strung between two chairs taken from the local school . 
but anyone who failed to stop and drove through it would draw volleys of weapons fire . 
keeping an eye on the traffic , gendarmes in blue uniforms stand under banana trees , covered with a layer of red dust . 
purple and orange bougainvillaea blossoms bordered by coffee Bushes snake around small shacks containing large families . 
the only sounds are passing vehicles , the deep lowing of cattle and from time to time the noise of what are known as &quot; internally displaced &quot; -- people who fled their homes as rebels or soldiers attacked . 
they are as miserable as refugees but have not crossed any national borders . 
farther south are their homes , burned to the ground , the fields deserted lying fallow . 
soldiers , with a morning buzz brought on by drinking their quota of beer , sing and dance on the backs of passing trucks . 
primus , Burundi &apos;s brew , is a major source of revenue for the Tutsi-led military government which seized power on July 25 and is largely cut off from the outside world by regional sanctions . 
regional leaders say the purpose of the embargo is to force the military and rebels into peace negotiations to stop the bloodletting threatening to turn Burundi into another Rwanda , where up to one million people were killed in genocide in 1994 . 
but both the rebels and the army still refuse unconditional talks , demanding the other side first lay down their arms .
