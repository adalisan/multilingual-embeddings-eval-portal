Britain &apos;s Queen Elizabeth , battling to restore dignity and affection for the monarchy , was said on Monday to be dismayed at being dragged into party political squabbling over a proposed new royal yacht . 
a pledge by the opposition Labour Party not to pay for the 60 million pound ( $ 100 million ) replacement vessel promised last week by the ruling Conservatives just weeks ahead of an election has put the royal family back in an unwelcome spotlight just when it was hoping for a period of quiet . 
aides at Buckingham Palace said the queen , who has always prided herself on remaining above politics , was anxious about the effect of the squabble on the standing of the monarchy -- damaged by a string of messy divorces and a high-spending image . 
&quot; Her Majesty is unhappy at the way the issue has been handled because it has been turned into a political issue . 
she is naturally sensitive about anything that affects the standing of the monarchy , &quot; one royal source told reporters . 
&quot; She was pleased to learn that finance for a new yacht was at last to be made available . 
but contrary to some reports neither she nor ( heir to the throne ) Prince Charles has rigid views on whether the cash should come from public or private sources . 
the royal yacht Britannia , which has a crew of more than 200 and costs about 10 million pounds a year to run , is on its last voyage before being taken out of service after 44 years . 
the government had put off for two years a decision over whether it would be replaced before a surprise announcement last week -- widely seen as an election ploy . 
labour , which has a 20-point lead ahead of elections that must be held by May , was taken off-guard and finally announced on Sunday it would not finance a new yacht when health and education badly needed public funds . 
labour &apos;s dithering may have been influenced by opinion polls showing that most Britons were against spending such huge sums on a royal family already seen as enjoying unique wealth and privilege . 
&quot; It must be very disagreeable for the queen . 
we are in a very emotive state in the House of Commons and practically anything we plan to do will be a political issue , &quot; Conservative MP Sir James Hill told BBC radio . 
the queen is powerless to intervene in the dispute over the yacht , which is used to take members of the royal family on official visits , to promote trade and also for private holidays . 
some media reports have suggested Prince Charles , who is deeply unpopular because of his adultery and divorce from Princess Diana , felt it unwise to replace the yacht at a time when growing numbers of Britons are unhappy with the monarchy as an institution . 
an unprecedented nationwide television debate on the monarchy this month gave Prince Charles a massive thumbs-down and although 66 percent voted in a phone-in poll to retain the royal family , 34 percent said it should be scrapped .
