Members of Congress of Argentina &apos;s ruling Peronist Party changed tack and decided to support moves to get secretive businessman Alfredo Yabran to clarify his activities to a committee , they said Friday . 
the Peronist majority in the lower house had voted against opposition motions Wednesday to debate summoning Yabran before a twin-house committee on security and to debate setting up an &quot; anti-mafia , &quot; or anti-crime ring , committee . 
but after a pow-wow of Peronist officials in Congress late Thursday the Peronist head of the security committee , Miguel Angel Toma , told reporters Friday : &quot; It is absolutely not true that Peronists blocked the proposal to summon Yabran . 
the motion &apos;s failure sparked accusations from former economy minister Domingo Cavallo that goverment ministers had leaned on Peronist deputies to save Yabran from a grilling in Congress . 
Cavallo , sacked last July , says Yabran has major stakes in the partly deregulated post business and private security and is building up monopolies for criminal ends . 
he wants Yabran investigated in connection with alleged &quot; mafias &quot; and accused Interior Minister Carlos Corach of leaning on deputies Wednesday -- a charge Corach denied . 
the former economy minister has repeatedly accused Corach and Justice Minister Elias Jassan of manipulating judges to protect corrupt businessmen . 
both are taking legal action . 
Toma said Peronist deputies had simply decided that with five &quot; high complex &quot; proposed bills to debate , some of them should be sent to relevant committees before being discussed . 
Yabran , an acquaintance of President Carlos Menem , is also taking legal action against Cavallo . 
&quot; Mr Yabran has nothing to hide , &quot; said Yabran &apos;s spokesman Wenceslao Bunge Thursday . 
the opposition has been shown special interest in Yabran since the murder of a photographer from Noticias news magazine earlier this year . 
Yabran and various Peronist officials have publicly rejected speculation linking his businesses with the murder of Jose Luis Cabezas , who had succeeded in taking a rare picture of the enigmatic tycoon .
