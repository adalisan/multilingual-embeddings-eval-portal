the Sri Lanka rupee closed barely moved against the dollar on Friday , with activity confined to the forwards market , dealers said . 
the rupee closed at 58.49 to the dollar , after opening at 58.48 . 
&quot; There was hardly any activity in the spot market , but forwards were somewhat active . 
banks either bought to cover forward imports , or thought it was a reasonable level at which to accumulate forwards , &quot; said a Commercial Bank dealer . 
overnight call money closed at 9.375 percent , after opening at 9.75 percent and rising to 10 , dealers said . 
dealers say the dollar-rupee exchange rate should remain at current levels , unless there is a large import bill , due to the market being well supplied with dollars .
