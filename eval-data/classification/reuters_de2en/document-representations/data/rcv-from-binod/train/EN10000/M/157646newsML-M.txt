NYMEX access energy prices rebounded in early overnight trade after failing to break through key support levels during the day , traders said . 
December crude exceeded its floor session high , surpassing the $ 24.38 ceiling to touch $ 24.43 a barrel after hours . 
after crude failed to drop below a key technical level of $ 24 a barrel , buying interest returned on access , brokers said . 
&quot; As long as we stay above $ 24 ( a barrel ) ... it &apos;ll try to rebound a little bit , &quot; one trader said . 
traders saw the prices staying range-bound on Thursday . 
meanwhile , price trends for gasoline and heating oil diverged during the day as refiners jacked up heating oil yields ahead of winter demand . 
after settling off 1.37 cents , November heating oil , which expires Thursday , rose 0.44 cent a gallon to 68.90 cents a gallon on access . 
approximately 88 lots were exchanged . 
November unleaded gasoline , which also expires tomorrow , edged up 0.15 cent a gallon to 70.15 cent a gallon , with about 82 lots traded . 
daytime trade for unleaded ended 0.90 cents higher at 70 cents a gallon .
