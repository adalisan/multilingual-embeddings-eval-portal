Hungary &apos;s parliament passed a law to compensate Holocaust survivors and a spokesman for the Jewish community said on Wednesday it was a first step to righting the wrongs of World War Two . 
&quot; I am happy because we were waiting for it for a long time , &quot; Peter Feldmajer , spokesman for the Alliance of Jewish Religious Communities of Hungary , told Reuters . 
but Feldmajer said the amount provided in the law was less than one tenth of a percent of what Hungarian Jews were entitled to , and a public foundation to be established as part of the compensation plan would fight for more . 
Parliament on Tuesday authorised the government to make available four billion forints ( $ 24 million ) in compensation coupons that would be administered by a public foundation to aid the Jewish community , newpapers reported . 
life annuities may be claimed by Hungarian Jews who are over 60 and are permanent residents , the reports said . 
there are believed to be about 10,000 to 15,000 elderly Holocaust survivors living in Hungary , which has a total Jewish community of 80,000 to 100,000 , compared with 800,000 before World War Two . 
the compensation coupons entitle the owners to buy land or shares in government-owned businesses . 
Feldmajer said compensation approved by parliament amounted to &quot; 0.01 percent &quot; of what Hungary &apos;s once-wealthy Jewish community was entitled to , but it was an important first step . 
&quot; It is just part of the compensation -- it will give Holocaust survivors some small pension , about 100 to 200 marks ( $ 60 to $ 120 ) every month . 
&quot; The government will also give some buildings , some paintings and some other things -- but this is a first step . 
&quot; The major battle was to start it and the foundation will be in a strong position to fight for more , &quot; he added . 
the programme is to be administered by a public foundation which must be approved by another act of parliament . 
in addition to the pensions , the foundation will have money to help fund schools , synagogues and other Jewish institutions , Feldmajer said . 
the membership of the foundation &apos;s 21-person board has been agreed after lengthy negotiations involving the government , the Hungarian Jewish community and the World Jewish Congress . 
Feldmajer said the board will have two representatives from the government , five or six from the Jewish community outside Hungary and the rest Hungarian Jews living in Hungary . 
&quot; So the priority is inside Hungary , &quot; he said , adding that the foundation could consider providing funds to build an old-age home or similar facility in Israel , where many Hungarian Jews who fled the Holocaust now live . 
the law passed on Tuesday implements an article of the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947 under which property confiscated by the fascists for racial or religious reasons and unclaimed by inheritors after the war must be turned over to organisations of the communities concerned . 
the money is to be spent to support the communities and family members still living , the news reports said .
