a Chinese boy kissed by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping five years ago says he misses the ailing ruler and wishes &quot; Grandpa Deng &quot; a happy lunar new year . 
the Communist Party mouthpiece , the People &apos;s Daily , on Thursday printed a December 1992 photograph of Deng kissing Yang Jiayun , then three years old , on a visit to Qizhong village near Shanghai . 
under the photo was a copy of Yang &apos;s brief 1997 holiday message to the man who launched in 1978 the market-oriented reforms that have turned a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse . 
&quot; Happy New Year Grandpa Deng . 
&quot; Although the handwriting is clumsy , the feelings towards Comrade Deng Xiaoping of this child who grew up under the era of reform and opening up show forth on paper , &quot; the newspaper said in a breathless commentary . 
the newspaper did not say if Yang &apos;s greeting was delivered to Deng , who is not expected to make a public appearance to usher in the Year of the ox that dawns on Friday . 
China &apos;s President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng earlier this week paid a formal Chinese new year call on Deng but made no comment on the health of the 92-year-old man , now believed to be in fragile health and with fading lucidity . 
Deng has not been seen in public since the 1994 Chinese lunar new year festival when he visited Shanghai and appeared frail and faltering .
