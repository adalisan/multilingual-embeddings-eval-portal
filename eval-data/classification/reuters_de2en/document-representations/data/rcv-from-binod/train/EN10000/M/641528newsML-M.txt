the FTSE 100 index will lose ground on Thursday drifting down to 4,545 in the first instance as caution returns to the market , technical amalysts said . 
but investors may decide there is more to lose and little to be gained in holding shares even at that level and the market may then be subject to a little more downward pressure which could take the FTSE down to 4,530 , they added . 
the saving grace may come from the bond market , which if it holds its nerve , should prevent a major fallout . 
UK banks and pharmaceuticals , which have been prime movers of the stock market , will run out of steam today as will oil company shares as investors turn defensive ahead of a decision on UK interest rates -- which is expected on Friday -- as well as tomorrow &apos;s U.S. payroll data . 
the FTSE is currently testing a descending trendline which connects its intra-day highs since last Friday and because it is still below its 10 day moving average , which is now at 4,628 , its short-term trend remains weak . 
and with the volatile nature of the market it could thrash about in a 50 point daily trading range over the next few days . 
the London market will seek direction from Wall Street and the mood over there is also cautious ahead of the payroll data . 
this has been reflected by a gradually decreasing trading range on the Dow Jones industrial average so far this week as shown on a daily bar chart of that index . 
trading activity seems to lie within a pair of converging trendlines connecting recent intra-day highs and lows . 
but this situation cannot persist for too long and analysts expect a sharp breakout on the Dow from its present confines -- with the FTSE to follow that same direction .
