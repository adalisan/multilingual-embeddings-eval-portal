Argentine stocks closed sharply lower in line with leading world markets on fears U.S. blue chips may be overvalued and set for a correction , dealers said . 
Argentina &apos;s leading index Merval .MERV closed 3.68 percent lower at 608.98 points , near its day &apos;s low . 
&quot; What we have seen today was virtually a deep correction , &quot; said Dario Lizzano , Banco Santander head of research . 
&quot; The local market felt the direct impact of international weakness , &quot; he added . 
after the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said last week shares in Wall Street were too high , Argentine dealers think there may be a possible rise in the U.S. call money rate . 
the local dealers said that possibility prompted a rise of the U.S. long bond rate to 6.62 percent from 6.49 percent , which squeezed liquidity in the Argentine Bolsa . 
volume fell to $ 25 million from $ 27 million on Tuesday . 
the broader general index .IGB shed 2.76 percent . 
losers beat gainers 45 to three . 
main losers among blue chips were steelmaker Acindar with a 7.25 percent fall and papermaker Celulosa , down 6.76 percent . 
&quot; In the short term the local market is headed for more corrections , although the medium term trend is still upward as local fundamentals are firm , &quot; Lizzano said .
