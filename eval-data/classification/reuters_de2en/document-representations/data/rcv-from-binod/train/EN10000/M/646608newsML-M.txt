leading Russian shares rose slightly on Monday but traders did not see significant change in the market in the near future as second-tier shares continued to attract most investor demand . 
the Russian Trading System index of 22 shares closed at 365.64 , up slightly from 360.94 on Friday ( corrects from Monday ) , on an unexceptional $ 32.4 million overall market turnover . 
&quot; So far all the movement in &quot; blue chips &quot; is due exclusively to individual orders -- no one is doing any global buying , &quot; said ING Bank trader Oleg Galkin . 
&quot; The market is weakly , step-by-step , moving upwards , purely out of inertia in my view . 
but traders noted Russian investors supporting the market in morning trade , and said foreign demand became noticeable during the day . 
&quot; In my view the market has got good support , &quot; said Renaissance Capital trader Vladimir Chkikvadze . 
Galkin said metals mining concern Norilsk nickel and oil company Surgutneftegaz were still enjoying demand left over from Friday , although near record levels were making many wary . 
Surgutneftegaz rose to $ 0.940 from $ 0.905 . 
national savings bank Sberbank continued its rise of recent days , rising to $ 196.00 from $ 194.00 .
