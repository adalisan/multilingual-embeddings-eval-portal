Andres Galarraga belted his second three-run Homer in as many days to tie for the National League home run lead and help the Colorado Rockies to an 8-4 thumping of the San Diego Padres Thursday . 
Larry Walker drove in three runs and Eric Young added a two-run double for Colorado , which used a five-run third inning to take control . 
Roger Bailey ( 8-5 ) picked up his third straight victory , allowing four runs and eight hits over six innings . 
Danny Jackson ( 1-4 ) was drilled for six runs and eight hits in six innings . 
he commited a key error in Colorado &apos;s big inning when he misplayed Bailey &apos;s comebacker with runners on first and second with no outs as San Diego lost its fifth in a row and for the seventh time in eight games . 
the Padres jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first on a two-run single by Archi Cianfrocco . 
Colorado took control in the third with five runs , capped by Galarraga &apos;s 20th home run , a blast over the right-centre fence for a 5-2 lead . 
the Homer tied Galarraga with Walker and Houston &apos;s Jeff Bagwell for the National League lead . 
in New York , rookie Jason Hardtke , recalled from the minor leagues three days ago , singled home Todd Hundley with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning to lift the Mets to a 7-6 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates . 
Hundley drew a one-out walk from Ricardo Rincon ( 2-4 ) . 
Carl Everett also walked and Hardtke , batting for the first time this season , lined a 1-1 pitch into right field . 
&quot; It was a great feeling , &quot; said Hardtke . 
&quot; It &apos;s not every day that you get a chance to drive in the winning run in the bottom of the ninth inning . 
the Pirates trailed 6-3 entering the ninth , but Dale Sveum smacked a three-run Homer off Mets closer John Franco to tie the game . 
&quot; We came back and let it get away , &quot; Pirates manager Gene Lamont said . 
in San Francisco , Shawn Estes went 7 1 / 3 innings to win his fifth straight decision and the giants out-homered the Los Angeles dodgers for a 5-2 victory . 
Estes ( 9-2 ) allowed one run and three hits , walked three and struck out seven before tiring in the eighth . 
Stan Javier led off the sixth with his third home run in as many games and Bill Mueller belted a two-run Homer off dodgers &apos; starter Pedro Astacio ( 3-6 ) to stake San Franisco to a 4-0 lead . 
Barry Bonds added a solo Homer in the eighth off reliever Mark Guthrie as the giants won for the sixth time in seven contests to move a season-high 12 games over .500 . 
the dodgers got their runs on solo homers by Billy Ashley in the seventh and Eric Karros in the ninth .
