the U.S. Agriculture Department will announce the fiscal 1998 ( Oct-Sep ) U.S. sugar import quota sometime close to its official deadline of September 17 , a USDA aide said Tuesday . 
despite earlier hopes that an announcement could come by the end of August , it &apos;s now apparent that it will take several more weeks to reach a final decision , Steve Hammond , leader of USDA &apos;s sugar policy group , told Reuters . 
USDA sets an import quota each year to control the amount of sugar entering the United States . 
the decision-making process typically pits sugar growers who favor a more restrictive quota against food processors and other sugar users who would like to see more imports allowed . 
on a related issue , Hammond said the United States and Mexico have already reached a joint determination on whether Mexico will have a net sugar surplus this year . 
under the North American Free Trade Agreement , Mexico is guaranteed 25,000 tonnes of the U.S. sugar quota in years when both nations agree it has a net surplus . 
Mexico can ship either refined sugar or raw cane sugar under the 25,000-tonne allocation . 
Hammond declined to say what determination had been made , pending the official announcement of country-by-country quota allocations next month . 
but in June , USDA forecast Mexico to export 550,000 tonnes of sugar in 1997-98 . 
that suggests it does have surplus supplies .
