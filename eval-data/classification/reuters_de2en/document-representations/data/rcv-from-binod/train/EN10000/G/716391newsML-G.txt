Cambodia &apos;s royalist FUNCINPEC party has been left stunned and cowed by the killing of a senior party member following the ouster of its leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh as first prime minister . 
many party members were hiding out on Wednesday , fearful of attacks against them . 
&quot; Most of them are living in a nightmare , scared , &quot; Ahmad Yahya , a national assembly member for Ranariddh &apos;s FUNCINPEC party said of his party colleagues . 
many FUNCINPEC members were moving between safe houses or holed up in hotels . 
they were unwilling to talk to reporters and , fearful of eavesdroppers , were reluctant to say more than a few bland words on their telephones . 
Ho Sok , a FUNCINPEC member who was secretary of state at the Interior Ministry , was picked up by troops loyal to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen outside a hotel on Monday . 
he was subsequently shot dead by soldiers , officials said . 
his death has sent a shock wave through the party , already stunned by the collapse of the ruling coalition and Hun Sen &apos;s bloody grab for power at the weekend . 
one Western analyst said Ho Sok &apos;s killing might have been intended as a message to FUNCINPEC , and if so , it was a very effective one . 
&quot; It &apos;s certainly intimidated people , &quot; he said . 
Ho Sok &apos;s murder , coming after two days of bloody street battles in Phnom Penh and the ouster of Ranariddh , who fled to France , left party members feeling totally defenceless and vulnerable , they said . 
&quot; For us it &apos;s finished . 
we cannot freely express our views , we cannot protect ourselves or our party . 
democracy is finished , &quot; Ahmad Yahya said . 
&quot; In Phnom Penh , in Cambodia , I don &apos;t think anywhere is safe . 
Ho Sok was one of four senior FUNCINPEC members accused by Hun Sen of being responsible for the two days of fighting in the capital that left at least 58 people dead and as many as 200 others , mostly civilians , wounded . 
Hun Sen said the four should be hunted down and arrested . 
the other three were Ranariddh &apos;s top military adviser General Nhiek Bun Chhay , Chao Sambath , a FUNCINPEC intelligence official , and Serey Kosal , the prince &apos;s chief security advisor . 
their whereabouts were not immediately known , although one official said on Wednesday that Chao Sambath had been picked up . 
there were also reports of moves against FUNCINPEC members in Cambodia &apos;s second city , Battambang , and in the northern town of Siem Reap , where clashes broke out on Tuesday when FUNCINPEC troops withdrew from the city to link up with comrades in the bush . 
&quot; Any FUNCINPEC members left here are in hiding , &quot; said a source in Siem Reap . 
&quot; They &apos;ve been going door-to-door looking for them &quot; . 
while FUNCINPEC troops regrouped in the northwest , where their military strength has been a match for Hun Sen &apos;s forces , many political observers saw little point in resisting Hun Sen. 
&quot; The party is decapitated and going through its last spasms , &quot; said a Western political analyst . 
&quot; Members are running around in circles , some cutting deals . 
everything is being done with a gun to their heads . 
many FUNCINPEC members were already falling in line with the new order . 
a tame FUNCINPEC would provide Hun Sen &apos;s power grab with a cloak of legitimacy but would never challenge his rule , analysts said . 
&quot; FUNCINPEC will be utterly compliant with the policies dictated to it . 
it will be a facade , &quot; a diplomat said .
