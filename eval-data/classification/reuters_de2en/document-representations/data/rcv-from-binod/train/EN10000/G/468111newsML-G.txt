the European Union said on Monday that it would not object to individual countries sending troops to Albania to act as military escorts for humanitarian aid convoys . 
but for the second time in eight days , the bloc shied away from organising its own multinational force to help restore order in the former communist state . 
&quot; There is no need to deploy a major multinational force , but a &apos; coalition of the willing &apos; exists and , on request from the Albanian government , we could investigate ways and means of operating , &quot; Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo told a news conference after a General Affairs Council . 
&quot; At the moment this coalition looks like the most viable avenue . 
EU foreign ministers in Brussels discussed a report from an exploratory mission to Tirana last week and decided the bloc had a &quot; very substantial &quot; role to play in helping Albania get back on its feet . 
as a next step , the EU said it would send a second advisory mission to Albania to advise on humanitarian , economic , political and security-related developments . 
Ministers said an advance team , including members from other international groups , would be sent to Albania this week with some 2 million Ecus ( $ 2.3 million ) worth of aid and would recommend who should be in the subsequent mission . 
the Dutch EU presidency said the EU would combine its planned humanitarian aid with Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) efforts to help the Albanians prepare for free elections in the summer . 
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette told French radio that the EU also planned to appoint an administrator who would be sent to Tirana to help Albania recover . 
it is estimated that $ 10 million in basic medical supplies and 10,000 tonnes of flour are urgently needed . 
EU Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Emma Bonino said last week aid was ready but that some form of security structure had to be put in place before it could be delivered . 
Albania wants foreign police units to help secure ports , airports , roads and railways so that relief supplies can be distributed . 
an Italian air force transport plane landed at Tirana airport on Monday with six tonnes of emergency medical aid for the northern part of the country , which is under government control . 
Italy sent in two tonnes of medical aid for the rebel-held south on the weekend . 
French radio said France would send 40 tonnes of humanitarian aid on Tuesday . 
aid shipments are thought to need a protection force to prevent them ending up in the hands of armed bandits . 
the EU earlier this month turned down Albanian requests for military intervention to help end disorder sparked by the collapse of savings schemes that bankrupted thousands . 
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said it was premature to send troops to clear a path for humanitarian aid , given that key aid agencies fear troops could in fact jeopardise the safety of their workers by making them targets for bandits . 
&quot; Some help may be useful to those providing aid , but our view is that we need further clarification from the aid agencies , &quot; he told reporters . 
but he confirmed that several EU members had prepared contingency plans to send troops and police to Albania if they were required to help aid get through . 
Turkey earlier said it was ready to provide troops to any international effort to distribute aid in Albania . 
EU foreign ministers were due to gather in Rome on Tuesday , when they will also meet Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino .
