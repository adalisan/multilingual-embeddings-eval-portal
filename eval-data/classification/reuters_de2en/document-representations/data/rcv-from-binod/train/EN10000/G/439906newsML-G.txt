European Union Internal Market Commissioner Mario Monti said he deeply regretted a failure by EU member states on Thursday to agree common rules on protecting design in the bloc &apos;s huge car spare parts market . 
however , Monti signalled that he would not give up on the controversial issue , which sets European car manufacturers against companies which make spare parts such as windscreens and door panels for their models . 
EU internal trade ministers excluded visible spare parts from a plan to harmonise EU legislation on protecting industrial designs and models . 
Member states would therefore continue to set their own national rules in this field . 
the ministers had missed &quot; a chance to set a clear standard which would apply for the whole territory of the Union and ensure the proper functioning of the single market in the fields of design , &quot; Monti said in a statement . 
however , he stressed that the debate was &quot; certainly not closed &quot; as the legislation still needed the approval of the European Parliament , which shares the views of the EU executive . 
Monti said he would continue to &quot; actively examine &quot; the possibilities to reach an agreement . 
the ministers went against the will of the European Commission , which wanted the legislation to include a so-called &quot; repairs clause &quot; allowing independent manufacturers to copy visible spare parts in exchange for a fee , and adopted the package on industrial design unanimously . 
apart from that setback , Monti welcomed the political deal on harmonising industrial design protection rules . 
&quot; This decision marks an important step towards ensuring a high level of protection for industrial designs and models throughout the EU , &quot; he said , adding it would stimulate investment in the bloc &apos;s manufacturing industry and boost jobs . 
however , Thursday &apos;s decision disappointed the parts industry , which says that thousands of independent spare parts and repair businesses are at risk . 
European car manufacturers dispute that argument , saying the present situation would not change . 
the debate involves legislation on harmonised EU rules to protect industrial designs from illegal copying if they fulfil certain criteria -- for example , they have to be new and have an individual character . 
the duration of protection would be between five and 25 years . 
arguing it was a special case , Monti had proposed allowing spare parts to be freely copied if parts makers paid a &quot; fair and reasonable &quot; sum to the car manufacturer . 
that drew fire from car manufacturers and EU states including France and Germany , partly because they saw practical difficulties in implementing it . 
Marc Greven , legal director at the European car manufacturers &apos; association ACEA , told Reuters on Wednesday that it would have deprived car makers of full rewards for their investment in research and innovation . 
but ECAR , representing consumers , insurers , and makers and distributors of spare parts said the ministerial deal was a &quot; black day for the EU &apos;s single market and for competition within the European Union . 
&quot; It warned that as much as 75 percent of the market would become closed to competition . 
Monti took some comfort from the fact that the agreement in principle excluded protection for spare parts such as oil filters and fan belts which are not visible during normal use .
