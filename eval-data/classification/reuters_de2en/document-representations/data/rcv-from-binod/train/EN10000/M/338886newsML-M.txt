German shares ended bourse trade mostly lower on Tuesday after investors took profits on bank stocks , but mostly waited out the release of key U.S. data in the afternoon . 
the 30-share DAX index , which tracks trade in German blue-chip stocks , ended the session down 5.20 points at 2,989.33 points . 
a strong surge in the dollar boosted export shares like Daimler-Benz but failed to fuel a broad buying spree . 
later , the market took an instant swing upward in line with Bunds in post-bourse dealing after the U.S. jobs cost data came out lower than expected . 
but in bourse trade , the main feature was a sell-off in bank shares , the outperformers of Monday , after third-ranked Commerzbank released a disappointing net profit figure for 1996 , sending its shares down 1.40 marks to 42.40 marks . 
Deutsche Bank took a similar battering , ending down 1.85 marks at 83.30 marks after announcing an unchanged 1996 dividend of 1.80 marks . 
Commerzbank had reported 1996 profit of around 1.19 billion marks , up 22 percent but below analysts &apos; forecasts for 1.3 billion marks . 
a Financial Times comment advising taking profits on German bank shares and Moody &apos;s move to downgrade Japanese banks this week was adding to pressure on bank shares . 
Deutsche Bank AG , which announced an unchanged dividend for 1996 , erased its gains from Monday to drop 1.65 marks to 83.50 marks . 
meanwhile Daimler-Benz rose 40 pfennigs to 114.10 marks and , after a slow start , engineering company Siemens AG rose 20 pfennigs to 78.78 marks as the market took a positive take on its report of a drop in first quarter net profit . 
the main Siemens figure was in line with forecasts and one dealer noted that underlying foreign order figures were strong .
