Brazil &apos;s Congress will be deserted this week as lawmakers make the most of the Easter holiday and return to their home bases , officials said . 
&quot; There &apos;s going to be lots of peace and quiet , &quot; said an aide to the government &apos;s chief whip in the Chamber of Deputies , Benito Gama . 
a schedule of events for the week distributed by the lower house included two discussion meetings Tuesday and Wednesday of a committee mulling a new law for the telecommunications sector and its privatization . 
but those meetings were likely to be postponed for lack of quorum , Gama &apos;s aide said . 
the next big event likely to take place in Congress was a first vote by the Chamber of Deputies on the government &apos;s civil service reform bill , scheduled for April 2 . 
leaders of political parties had been due to meet Tuesday to discuss how to overcome opposition to the reform , in particular a ceiling on public sector pay and pensions which would cost lawmakers money . 
but that meeting had been postponed because the leaders were not expected in Brasilia , a congressional official said . 
not much activity is expected this week in the Senate either . 
an upper house probe into alleged fraud involving state and municipal bonds was due to resume April 2 .
