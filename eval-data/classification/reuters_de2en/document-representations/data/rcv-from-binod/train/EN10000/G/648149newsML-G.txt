Italian police arrested four people and served warrants on 24 others already in custody as part of an investigation into 28 Mafia murders , judicial sources said on Monday . 
the crackdown came three days after security forces arrested Pietro Aglieri , one of Italy &apos;s most wanted Mafia godfathers . 
along with two suspected mob hitmen . 
magistrates issued the latest batch of arrest warrants following information supplied by five Mafia turncoats on bloody territorial battles between rival mob clans in the eastern Sicilian city of Catania between 1980 and 1990 . 
police believe almost all Catania &apos;s gangster clans were involved in the wars in which 28 people died .
