Australian Prime Minister John Howard said on Wednesday that the Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) would note government budgetary action when it next considered interest rates . 
the government &apos;s Tuesday budget , for the year to June 1998 , had set the climate for lower rates , he said on Perth radio 6PR . 
&quot; ... cutting debt further , producing a surplus in year two of this budgetary cycle -- that &apos;s 98 / 99 -- that means that there is downward and not upward pressure on interest rates , &quot; Howard said when asked whether the budget would bring down interest rates . 
when the bank next considered monetary settings it would know that the government &quot; has done its bit , &quot; he said . 
the interviewer suggested that the government had set the climate for lower rates and Howard responded : &quot; Of course we have set the climate . 
the budget included measures that would improve the fiscal balance by A $ 352 million in 1997 / 98 and , more importantly , A $ 1.9 billion in the following year , when the government would deliver an underlying surplus -- that is , excluding asset sales . 
the bank eased monetary policy 1.5 percentage points last year , to bring overnight cash rates down to 6.0 percent , and markets see little chance of further easing this year . 
this is the full exchange between Howard and the interviewer , Neil Mitchell : 
interviewer : &quot; Do you think this will now bring interest rates down ? 
Howard : &quot; Well that is a matter ultimately to be determined , if I may say so , by market forces . 
interviewer : &quot; Of course . 
exactly . 
of course it &apos;s going to be set by market forces . 
&quot; But I tell you this , Neil , that cutting debt further , producing a surplus in year two of this budgetary cycle -- that &apos;s 98 / 99 -- that means that there is downward and not upward pressure on interest rates . 
&quot; In other words when the monetary authorities next look at interest rates -- and I &apos;m not tellilng them what they ought to do , that &apos;s a matter for the monetary authorities -- but when they next look at interest rates they will know that the government has done its bit . 
&quot; The government has not added to interest rate pressure . 
the government this year will repay A $ 5 billion of the debts of the Australian people . 
interviewer : &quot; At least , the government has set the climate for lower interest rates . 
Howard : &quot; Of course we have set the climate .
