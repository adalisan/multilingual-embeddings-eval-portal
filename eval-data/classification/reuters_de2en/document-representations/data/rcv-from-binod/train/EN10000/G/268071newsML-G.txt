Israeli jets raided Hizbollah targets in south Lebanon on Thursday after guerrillas fired mortar bombs at an Israeli post during a visit by a senior officer , security sources said . 
Israeli security sources said Major-General Amiram Levine , Israel &apos;s northern commander , was at the Braachit post on the edge of Israel &apos;s south Lebanon occupation zone when it came under attack . 
Levine was not injured but one officer was lightly wounded , they said . 
it was the second time in less than a week Shi &apos;ite Moslem guerrillas have come close to hitting a senior Israeli commander . 
on Saturday , Hizbollah fighters ambushed an Israeli convoy in the zone , lightly injuring a soldier and very lightly injuring Brigadier-General Eli Amitay , identified in Israeli newspapers as commander of Israel &apos;s liaison unit to south Lebanon . 
two Hizbollah guerrillas were killed in the attack . 
after Thursday &apos;s attack , two Israeli warplanes fired two air-to-surface rockets into the Jabal Safi and Mleita areas in the Iqlim al-Toufah ridge , a bastion for the Hizbollah guerrillas north of the Israeli-held south Lebanon zone . 
there was no immediate word on Lebanese casualties in the air raid , the fourth in less than a week against suspected Hizbollah bases in Lebanon . 
on Wednesday , Israeli planes struck twice into the Iqlim and on Sunday Israeli aircraft targeted other suspected Hizbollah targets in southeast Lebanon after a clash between Israeli troops and Moslem guerrillas . 
there were no casualties reported in the three air attacks . 
last Tuesday , a five-nation group monitoring an eight-month-old ceasefire in Lebanon said at least one Katyusha rocket was fired from south Lebanon into Israel on Friday night . 
the monitors however did not reprimand Lebanon . 
Hizbollah , which fired Katyushas at Israel before the ceasefire , denied it fired the rockets . 
the Katyusha was the first fired at northern Israel since an April 26 understanding ended a 17-day Israeli blitz on Lebanon in which 200 people , mostly civilians , were killed .
