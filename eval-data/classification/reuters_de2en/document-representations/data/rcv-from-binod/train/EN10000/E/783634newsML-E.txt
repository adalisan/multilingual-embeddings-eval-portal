Japan ought to make the biggest contribution among foreign countries to an international package to help Thailand overcome its economic problems , a senior official of the Ministry of Finance ( MOF ) told a news conference on Wednesday . 
the official , briefing reporters on a statement issued earlier by Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka , said he could not comment at present on the amount of support to be provided by Japan . 
the amount would be decided when the international rescue package became concrete in negotiations between the Thai government and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , he said . 
Japan &apos;s Finance Ministry is not worried about the fundamental strength of the Thai economy , but it is a fact that there is a problem in its financial sector and state finances , he said . 
he said the problem of the Thai currency , the baht , was unlikely to spread to neighbouring countries . 
&quot; We do not see a problem in other Asian nations &apos; economic fundamentals and we do not think that the economies in other Asian nations have worsened recently , &quot; the official said . 
&quot; Given the magnitude of relations between Japan and Thailand , it is natural for Japan to extend the largest amount of financial help to the country , &quot; the official said . 
the steps taken by Thailand to address its economic problems were necessary and welcome , he said . 
he said the IMF had asked mainly Asian countries to help in the Thai package , and had also asked multinational institutions to join in . 
he did not know if the Japanese help for Thailand would be yen-denominated . 
&quot; It will not be long before the international support package is completed , &quot; he added . 
finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said in a statement earlier on Wednesday that Japan welcomes the comprehensive economic reform package announced by Thailand on Tuesday . 
Mitsuzuka said he applauded the measures , including the suspension of cash-strapped finance firms , and the decision to raise the value-added tax . 
&quot; Such measures will contribute to the stability of financial markets and to the longer-term development of the Thai economy , &quot; Mitsuzuka said . 
Mitsuzuka also said he hoped ongoing discussions between the IMF and Thailand over an economic adjustment programme would reach a final agreement soon . 
he said Japan had received a request from the IMF to extend support to Thailand and said Tokyo &quot; strongly supports such moves &quot; . 
Thailand &apos;s government on Tuesday unveiled a set of reforms to help ease its economic woes after the baht came under fierce attack from investors worried about the country &apos;s excessive foreign borrowing and frail banking system . 
the baht has lost 20 percent of its value since it was allowed to float on July 2 . 
the programme is aimed at securing about $ 15 billion in loans from the IMF and foreign nations . 
it includes the suspension of operations of more than half of Thailand &apos;s finance companies , a three percentage point rise in the value-added tax , and strict monetary and fiscal targets for the next few years .
