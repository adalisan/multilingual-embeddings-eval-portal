German debt prices opened higher on Friday , reversing some of the losses sustained in a late sell-off on Thursday . 
traders and analysts said the market was likely to be subdued but relatively well supported , looking ahead to the probable confirmation of a slowdown in M3 money supply growth when data for May are released . 
m3 growth , which might be released this session or at the beginning of next week , is expected to slow to 6.2 percent from 6.7 percent in April -- finally reaching the Bundesbank &apos;s target corridor of 3.5 to 6.5 percent . 
&quot; There have been whispers in some quarters that ( the expected decline in the M3 ) might give scope for another Bundesbank easing , but we dismiss this , &quot; one analyst said in a research note . 
traders , too , said a loosening of monetary policy as a result of M3 data was very unlikely , since the Bundesbank has repeatedly said over the past few months that it sees no reason to adjust monetary conditions either way . 
by 0708 GMT , the September Bund future was trading three basis points higher at 101.04 , while the 10-year cash Bund was quoted at 101.67 bid for a 5.768 percent yield . 
the other main focus for the market will be the German government &apos;s issuance calendar for the third quarter , expected to be published by the Bundesbank sometime in the next few session . 
analysts estimate that around 40 to 45 billion marks of new paper is likely to be scheduled for issue . 
&quot; With gross funding excluding Bubills set to tolat just over 190 billion marks this year , the cumulative total to date of 102 billion marks suggests that the supply programme is broadly on target , &quot; Philip Tyson , analyst at HSBC markets in London said in a note . 
&quot; Therefore , while gross third quarter issuance is expected to be greater that last year &apos;s total of 28 billion marks , we do not anticipate more than 40 to 45 billion marks .
