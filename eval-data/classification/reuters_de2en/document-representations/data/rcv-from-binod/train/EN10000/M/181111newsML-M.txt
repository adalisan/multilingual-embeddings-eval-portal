the Philippine Central Bank is planing to issue longer-term reverse repurchase instruments of 120 days to one year , a Central Bank official said on Monday . 
at present , the Central Bank offers overnight , one-month , two-month and three-month reverse repos . 
the statement came a week after the Bureau of Treasury cut its weekly offering of Treasury bills , which have maturities of three months , six months and one year , to 3.5 billion pesos from 5.0 billion pesos . 
however , the bank &apos;s treasury head Sergio Edeza insisted that the move was not in reaction to the lower T-bill offering , but to give the bank more flexibility in managing liquidity . 
the Central Bank used to issue reverse repos with four and six month maturities , but withdrew them from the market . 
it did not give any explanation .
