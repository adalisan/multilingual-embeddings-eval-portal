U.S. debt futures ended lower after a very quiet session , pressured by jitters before Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on Wednesday and upcoming supply . 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will deliver his semiannual address on the state of the U.S. economy to the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday . 
his testimony to the House Banking Committee was postponed until March 5 from Thursday . 
&quot; Greenspan , weak technicals and supply are all coming together at one time , &quot; said Don Pullen , ED and F Man &apos;s trading floor manager for T-bonds . 
Treasury will auction $ 17.5 billion in two-year notes on Tuesday and $ 12.5 billion in five-year notes on Wednesday . 
&quot; We opened beneath support at 112-24 / 32 and we just couldn &apos;t recover , &quot; Pullen said . 
&quot; We did find support off of 112-14 / 32 but we could not really get much going from the weak opening and it suggests the market remains on the defensive , &quot; Pullen said . 
he said lower levels could prevail into the week . 
strong support rests at 112-3 / 32 to 112-5 / 32 , some technicans said . 
&quot; It was kind of a dud day again , &quot; a T-bond options trader said . 
&quot; We &apos;re not having very broad ranges . 
another T-bond options trader said the market could languish into midweek and then stage a &quot; relief rally &quot; after Greenspan &apos;s first leg of testimony is complete . 
others said the market could remain rangebound until his second day of testimony . 
John Nyhoff , chief economist for Mitusbishi Financial futures , said most of what the market will be interested in should come from Greenspan &apos;s written commentary , released Wednesday . 
&quot; The delay isn &apos;t really going to keep the market in suspended animation for the extra week , &quot; Nyhoff said . 
any differences in Greenspan &apos;s testimony will likely be in the question-and-answer sessions to the committees , not in the testimony itself , Nyhoff said . 
bond options sources noted paper buying of about 5,000 June 112 bond calls . 
at the end of pit trading , March T-bonds were down 10 / 32 at 112-20 / 32 , T-notes eased 5 / 32 to 109-17 / 32 , muni-bonds lost 7 / 32 to 116-30 / 32 , June T-bills were flat at 94.94 , and June Eurodollars lost one basis point to 94.39 .
