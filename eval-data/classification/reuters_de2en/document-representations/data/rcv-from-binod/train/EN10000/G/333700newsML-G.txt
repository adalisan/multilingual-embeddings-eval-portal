government negotiators and rebel leaders in Bangladesh pressed ahead on Sunday with talks to find a way of ending a decades-old insurgency in Bangladesh &apos;s Chittagong Hill Tracts region . 
&quot; We are continuing our efforts to reach to a position where from we can strike a peace agreement , &quot; A.B.M. 
Mohiuddin Chowdhury , mayor of the port city of Chittagong and a member of the government &apos;s negotiating team , told reporters after after a five-hour session . 
the peace talks started on Saturday when the tribal leaders headed by the chief political wing of Shanti Bahini ( peace force ) Jyotirindra Budhipriya Larma flew to Dhaka aboard a military helicopter from Dudukchhari , a remote Hill Tracts village near the Indian border . 
asked whether any peace deal could be expected during the current round of talks , Chowdhury said : &quot; We are trying but nothing sure can be said until we conclude our talks . 
he said talks would continue on Monday . 
he declined to say when they might end . 
but one government official , requesting anonymity , said the rebels leaders were scheduled to leave Dhaka by Monday afternoon . 
it was the first time that Shanti Bahini had taken part in talks with the government outside the 5,500 sq mile ( 14,200 sq km ) Hill Tracts region . 
Shanti Bahini ( Peace Force ) has been fighting a bush war since 1973 for autonomy of the Hill Tracts which borders India and Burma . 
soon after taking office in June , Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina formed a national committee , comprising representatives of the ruling and opposition parties , to boost intiatives to resolve the problems in the Hill Tracts . 
designated members of the committee from the largest opposition group , the Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) of former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia , did not take part . 
in addition to autonomy , the Shanti Bahini ( Peace Force ) also wants 300,000 Bengali-speaking settlers expelled from the area . 
officials say more than 8,500 rebels , soldiers and civilians have been killed in the insurgency , which has forced around 50,000 tribespeople to seek refuge in the northeastern Indian state of Tripura .
