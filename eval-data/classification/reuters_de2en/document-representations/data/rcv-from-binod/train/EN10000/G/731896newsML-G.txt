his hobbies include theoretical physics and writing computer software , but U.S. astronaut Michael Foale is being asked to perform the mission of his career with just a few tools and loose wires in hand . 
officials at Mission Control outside Moscow on Wednesday said they had asked Foale , 40 , to take over for Mir commander Vasily Tsibliyev , 43 , who has developed a probably stress-induced heart problem , in repairing the damaged space station . 
the repairs , now tentatively planned for the end of next week , are vital to restoring power to Mir , which suffered the worst accident in its 11-year history on June 25 when it collided with its resupply vessel . 
NASA has not given the final green light to the British-born Foale &apos;s new role , and Russian Mission Control says if he feels unsure in the task , a Russian-French crew now in training and due to dock with Mir on August 7 would take over the mission . 
but both sides said they would try a dress rehearsal with Foale and engineer Alexander Lazutkin in spacesuits next Monday to see if they feel happy with a tentative July 24 repair date . 
&quot; Our task here is just to judge if technically it &apos;s feasible or not , and from everything we &apos;ve seen it looks feasible , &quot; NASA shuttle astronaut Leroy Chiao , who is participating in planning at Mission Control , said in an interview . 
&quot; The details we &apos;re working on now are the training plan , and we &apos;re also looking at the actual Eva ( spacesuit operations ) procedures and contingency or emergency procedures , &quot; he said . 
veteran cosmonaut Sergei Krikalyov , the deputy mission director , said Foale , who holds a doctorate in astrophysics from Cambridge University , was up to the task even though he lacked Tsibliyev &apos;s experience in spacesuit missions . 
during the repairs , Foale would play a supporting role , waiting inside a small airlock which connects Mir &apos;s main body with several modules , including the damaged Spektr and the Soyuz escape vessel he was originally expected to man . 
Tsibliyev is now expected to take Foale &apos;s original place waiting in the Soyuz &quot; lifeboat &quot; in case something goes wrong . 
&quot; We probably will simplify the procedure a little bit to minimise crew workload , but it &apos;s basically the same , &quot; Krikalyov said . 
Foale would seal off the airlock area from the rest of Mir and depressurise it before Lazutkin opens the hatch through to Spektr and partially enters the module , which was punctured and is now airless after the accident . 
with Lazutkin in the lead , the pair would try to attach 17 cables from Spektr &apos;s solar panels to the rest of the ship and then install a new hatch allowing the cables to pass through . 
there are several dangers , including the unknown of what lurks inside the Spektr , where no one has been since June 25 . 
&quot; In normal space flight you restrain everything on the walls so you don &apos;t have things floating around , but in the event of a decompression like this it &apos;s hard to say what might have come off the walls , &quot; Chaio said . 
&quot; I guess the bottom line is we really don &apos;t know what to expect . 
another danger involves the unlikely possibility that the new hatch does not seal the Spektr off from the rest of Mir . 
&quot; If there was a huge leak , in the absolute worst case , then the two space-suited cosmonauts would go into the Soyuz and have to abandon ship , &quot; Chaio said .
