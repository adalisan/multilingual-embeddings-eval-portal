the market drew little inspiration from several interim reports published during the session , brokers said .

trade in Valmet was relatively lively , topping 40 million markka , making it the second most-traded share . 
&quot; Valmet &apos;s result was below expectations , but basic sentiment towards the company is quite positive , &quot; one broker said after Valmet had tested its 90.00 markka support level . 
Nokia fell 1.50 markka to 344.50 after a fairly steady session , but following a lower opening in New York . 
furniture , white goods and plastic pipes maker asko was perky ahead of its four-month report due on Thursday . 
it added 3.90 markka to 104.90 in lively 13 million markka trade . 
&quot; Good results are expected , &quot; one broker said . 
forestries eased , with UPM-Kymmene off 0.90 to 118.50 and Enso closing flat at 47.80 .
