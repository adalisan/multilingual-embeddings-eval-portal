China has shut down thousands of small but heavily polluting mills and factories in a drive to curb rampant environmental damage , the China Daily said on Friday . 
&quot; These factories not only lag far behind in manufacturing techniques , equipment and technology , they have also wasted resources and energy , &quot; the newspaper quoted a State Environmental Protection Bureau circular as saying . 
such factories had &quot; caused incalculable harm to the environment and human health &quot; , the order said . 
earlier this month the bureau issued a circular ordering heavily polluting small-scale factories in 15 industries to close by September 30 . 
officials in the central province of Hebei had closed more than 1,500 factories by mid-September and would shut down more than 9,000 by the end of the month , the newspaper said . 
similar closures were taking place in other parts of China , it said but gave no further details . 
under the campaign , authorities would close paper mills with an output of less than 5,000 tonnes a year , tanneries that made less than 30,000 leather items a year and dye factories with an output of less than 500 tonnes , it said . 
the bureau has also vowed to close small-scale oil refineries , pesticide plants and producers of radioactive materials . 
China has hundreds of thousands of factories that operate with little or no waste control facilities . 
other official media warned that pollution in China &apos;s offshore waters was a serious problem , with industrial and domestic waste pouring into the ocean and damage from oil already grave . 
China had discharged up to 8.6 billion tonnes of waste into the ocean last year , with industrial and domestic sewage to blame for 80 percent of sea pollution , the Xinhua news agency said . 
although a law aimed at protecting the seas took effect in 1983 , environmental experts had urged Beijing to step up efforts to control the amount of waste being dumped into the sea , it said .
