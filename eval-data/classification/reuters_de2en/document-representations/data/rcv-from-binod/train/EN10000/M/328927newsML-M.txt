Germany &apos;s DAX index ended bourse trade on Thursday slightly higher in range-trade dealings , recovering from earlier weakness after German M3 money supply growth was higher than expected in December . 
the 30-share index ended up 4.79 points at 3,033.46 points after spending the session within a 20-point range , helped in part by the ongoing strength in the dollar and on Wall Street . 
the German share market also showed little reaction to the Bundesbank keeping key interest rates steady at its fortnightly council meeting on Thursday , a move the market had expected . 
hopes for even a modest trimming of the German central bank &apos;s key money market rate , the repo , were dashed after December M3 money supply grew at an annual 7.9 percent rate compared with 8.0 percent in November . 
the M3 data also grew by 8.1 percent in the final quarter of 1996 from the final quarter a year earlier , which was above the bank &apos;s four to seven percent expansion corridor for 1996 . 
&quot; The money supply figures were a shock , &quot; said one trader , noting the modest drop in the DAX after information about the Bundesbank &apos;s key monetary policy indicator was released . 
dealers also expressed some concern about details emerging on Germany &apos;s planned tax reform , with the Bonn government &apos;s tax working group saying earlier on Thursday that it plans included a proposal to tighten rules on short-term share market gains . 
&quot; That acted as a dampener , largely because the market is rather nervous in any case , &quot; said one trader . 
among individual shares , engineering group Mannesmann ended up five marks at 648 marks after announcing that its DBKom domestic communications joint venture , renamed as Arcor , would invest some 800 million marks in 1997 .
