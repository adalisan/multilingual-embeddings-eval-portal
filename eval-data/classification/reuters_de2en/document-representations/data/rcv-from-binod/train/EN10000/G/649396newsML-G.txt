the presidents of Russia and Belarus signed into law on Tuesday a Union Treaty integrating their two ex-Soviet states , but disagreements rumbled on over the final outcome of the deal . 
Boris Yeltsin and Alexander Lukashenko signed the treaty bill shortly after it was ratified by the upper chambers of parliament , their offices said . 
but experts and politicians were still arguing about the significance of the union , launched by the two heads of state in April and filled out with a charter the following month . 
some said it was just a formality . 
others disputed the economic advantages and disadvantages for both states if agreements were fulfilled . 
Kremlin insiders , meanwhile , said it could serve as a means for Yeltsin to win a third presidential term . 
under the Russian constitution , Yeltsin cannot stand again in 2000 , but , if Russia and Belarus form a single state , they said he would have the right to contest the presidency of what would , technically , be a new country . 
no decision is likely soon , considering the shaky health record of the 66-year-old Russian leader who had a quintuple heart bypass operation last November . 
in Moscow , 144 deputies in the Federation Council voted for the treaty and an accompanying charter . 
no one opposed it . 
in Minsk , all 59 members of the Council of the Republic who were present backed the deal . 
&quot; Belarussians and Russians have lived as one family for centuries , &quot; Alexander Dubko , governor of the Grodno region in western Belarus , told the chamber . 
&quot; We are striking this union out of love , from the heart . 
the lower houses in both states ratified the deal earlier . 
the treaty was a watered-down version of an original draft , amended last month after liberals in the Russian government warned that the original could give hardliner Lukashenko too much power and damage Russia &apos;s interests . 
the Belarussian parliament was set up by Lukashenko after his victory in a controversial referendum last November which he used to expand his powers and rewrite the constitution . 
Belarussian opposition nationalists refuse to recognise the new parliament in Minsk and fiercely opposed the deal , which they described as a sell-out of Belarussian interests . 
many sceptics in Russia say the economy of 10-million strong Belarus , where post-Soviet market reforms have barely started , will be a burden for the 150 million Russians . 
but most Russians and Belarussians , nostalgic for the Soviet Union , support integration moves between their states . 
in Russia , integration with Belarus is one of rare issues of accord between Yeltsin and the communist opposition . 
Interfax news agency said Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov would visit Minsk on Wednesday to exchange ratification documents with Lukashenko . 
Lukashenko told the Russian government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta that the two states would more this year to unify tariffs on energy , communications and transport and would coordinate tax systems . 
&quot; A new inter-state regional grouping is being formed capable of protecting home industries in the domestic market and help them in the international one , &quot; he said . 
yet on a very different note , speaking in parliament after the ratification , Lukashenko lashed out at Moscow and accused unnamed ministers of &quot; torpedoing &quot; implementation of the treaty . 
chief among those seen as responsible for watering down the union is First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais , whom Yeltsin appointed in March to push through new economic reforms . 
Lukashenko later told reporters that if the situation did not improve , he would take it up later this week with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin at the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi , where they will both be on holiday . 
Chernomyrdin &apos;s spokesman told reporters in Moscow the prime minister was surprised and disappointed by Lukashenko &apos;s remarks .
