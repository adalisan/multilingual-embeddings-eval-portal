&quot; The market is taking a spring nap as we have just a few trading days for MinFins , &quot; Eurobank dealer Olivier Coursault said . 
&quot; There is not much activity , no client interest . 
&quot; The market is completely linked to U.S. treasuries and they are quiet , with traders staying on the waiting side , &quot; he added . 
U.S. statistic data is due next week and it is likely to make the future of U.S. interest rates clearer . 
but dealers said some buying activity was seen in thin trading , mainly in the fourth and fifth tranches . 
&quot; Vnesh debt firmed today and MinFins have tracked them , &quot; an International Moscow Bank dealer said and added demand was apparently coming from London operators .
