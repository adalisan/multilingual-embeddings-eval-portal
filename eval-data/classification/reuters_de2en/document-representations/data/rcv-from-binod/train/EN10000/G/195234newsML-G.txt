Australian Prime Minister John Howard said on Monday latest reports were that the out-of-control Russian Mars space probe could land in the Timor Sea between Australia and Indonesia . 
the White House said earlier that it might land in eastern-central Australia at 0100 GMT on Monday . 
&quot; One of the latest reports said it could land somewhere in the Timor Sea , &quot; Howard said . 
but Howard said it was impossible to predict where the space probe , which was carrying four canisters of plutonium , could hit the earth . 
scientists said much of it could burn up as it reenters the atmosphere . 
&quot; It is impossible to say when it will hit the earth or where it will come down ... , &quot; Howard said . 
&quot; We can not be certain where the probe will come to earth . 
Howard told reporters Russian authorities had advised Canberra that four lethal plutonium canisters on board were designed to withstand the heat of re-entry and impact on the ground . 
&quot; In which case , there would be no danger of contamination , &quot; he said .
