an equaliser 83 seconds into injury time rescued high-flying premier league Wimbledon from bowing out of the League Cup to Luton on Tuesday . 
the second division side had outplayed the Londoners over 90 minutes of their third round replay at Luton but paid the price for failing to get the goals their approach play deserved when Stewart Castledine shot Wimbledon &apos;s equaliser . 
Peter Fear rubbed salt into the wound by shooting home Wimbledon &apos;s winner eight minutes into extra time . 
Luton , unbeaten in 13 matches , had taken the lead in the 28th minute when Wimbledon &apos;s Dean Blackwell sent a back header floating into his own net . 
premier league Southampton were also given a fright by third division battlers Lincoln before securing a 3-1 win in their replay . 
Gareth Ainsworth gave Lincoln a ninth-minute lead and Southampton had to wait until 15 minutes from time before Jim Magilton fired home an equaliser from the penalty spot after Jason Barnett had tripped Egil Ostenstadt . 
substitute Gordon Watson ended Lincoln &apos;s stubborn resistance in the 84th minute , burying a right-foot shot in the bottom corner . 
Eyal Berkovic completed a flattering victory for the Saints with a goal in the dying seconds .
