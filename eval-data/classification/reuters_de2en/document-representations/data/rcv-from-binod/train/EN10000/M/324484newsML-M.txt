Colombia &apos;s peso dropped 5.65 to 1,033 pesos per dollar by the close Wednesday on a wave of speculation and fears that the country would once again be decertified as a U.S. ally in the drug war , traders said . 
the peso opened at 1,029.5 , hit an intraday high of 1,028 and sank to an intraday low of 1,035.45 . 
dealers reported 419 operations worth a total $ 183.9 million . 
&quot; There was a lot of speculation in the markets and some demand driven by multinationals looking for greenbacks and others fearing renewed decertification by the United States , &quot; one trader said . 
he said that the speculative bubble could burst before the end of the week and allow the peso to rebound . 
the specter of decertification is looming for the second consecutive year after the country &apos;s alleged cocaine kings , Gilberto and Miguel Rodrguez Orejuela , were given lightweight jail terms last week , which has sparked the ire of the White House . 
some business analysts fear the United States will not only cut non-drug aid , an automatic consequence of decertification , but could also clamp economic sanctions on key Colombian export sectors .
