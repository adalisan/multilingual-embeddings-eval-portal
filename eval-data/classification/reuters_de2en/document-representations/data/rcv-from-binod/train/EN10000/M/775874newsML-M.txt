Iraqi and Colombian news dominated the U.S. foreign crude market on Monday , creating price cross-currents that are likely to take several days to sort out , traders said . 
the United Nations approved Iraq &apos;s aid distribution plan on Monday , paving the way for renewed humanitarian exports under the &quot; oil-for-food &quot; deal . 
Baghdad is expected to submit new pricing formulas for customers as early as Tuesday , Iraqi ambassador to the U.N. Nizar Hamdoon told Reuters . 
the impending resumption of exports is likely to depress sour crude prices in the Atlantic Basin , traders said . 
nonetheless , some grades , such as Ecuadoran Oriente and Venezuelan Mesa , have already been heavily sold into September as refiners snapped up alternative cargoes as insurance against possible delays in Iraqi shipments . 
before today &apos;s landmark approval , Oriente was pegged around October West Texas Intermediate / Cushing minus $ 3.00 a barrel for September delivery , while Mesa was assessed around $ 2.50 to $ 2.75 under WTI . 
the Iraqi news coincided with declarations of force majeure on Colombian Cano Limon crude oil for the second time in three weeks . 
back-to-back rebel bombings of the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline , together with a damaging landslide , have disrupted production , transport and apparently loadings at least until the end of the week , traders said . 
on Friday , Colombian Ecopetrol sold a cargo of Cano Limon for August 26-31 loading to a U.S. refiner at around September WTI minus $ 2.20 a barrel . 
on the same day , the company sold Cusiana for September 7-11 loading to another U.S. refiner at October WTI minus 78 cents a barrel , down sharply from minus 57 cents in the last deal last week . 
an overhang of sweet barrels from Nigeria is part of the reason for the downturn in the Cusiana price , traders said . 
also last Friday , Ecopetrol placed South Blend for August 20-30 loading with a U.S. West Coast refiner at September WTI minus $ 3.10 a barrel . 
elsewhere in the region , Uruguay &apos;s state oil refiner ANCAP is seeking to buy one million barrels of crude oil for October 1-10 delivery , trade sources said . 
the formal tender is scheduled to be issued on August 8 , with an award due next week . 
the company is looking to buy crude with an API gravity of 26-45 degrees and a sulfur content of 0.5 percent to 1.8 percent . 
in its last purchase tender , ANCAP bought one million barrels of Iranian Heavy crude from Brazil &apos;s state oil company Petrobras for delivery in the second half of August .
