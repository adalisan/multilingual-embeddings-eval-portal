Taiwan &apos;s money rates were lower at midday on Wednesday as liquidity gradually returned to the banking system after the Chinese new year holiday which ended on Monday , dealers said . 
the overnight interbank rate was at 6.099 percent against Tuesday &apos;s 6.260 close , with 30-day commercial paper falling to 5.70-5.75 from 5.75-6.00 . 
but dealers said they did not expect any sharp rate fall as the market &apos;s accumulated reserve excess still showed a negative T $ 585.8 billion . 
the rates had been at yearly high levels due to business funding needs before the five-day Chinese new year holiday , but they fell sharply on Tuesday after cash demand eased . 
government bond yields were higher on profit-taking triggered by worries over likely hikes in water fees and oil product prices , dealers said . 
the 10-year 86 / 4 bond yield was at 6.0550-6.0650 percent against 6.0480-6.0490 .
