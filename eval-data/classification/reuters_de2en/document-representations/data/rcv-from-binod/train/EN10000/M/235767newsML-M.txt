the MSCI Taiwan index is a market capitalisation-weighted index of 77 component stocks , which represent a sampling of large , medium and small capitalised stocks covering 67 pecent of the Taiwan stock market . 
the index has an almost identical correlation with the Taiwan All Share Index ( ( TAIEX ) compiled by the Taiwan stock exchange . 
trading hours will be 8.45 am to 12.15 pm Singapore time ( 1645 to 2015 GMT ) from Mondays to Fridays , and 8.45 am to 11.15 am ( 1645 to 1915 GMT ) on Saturdays . 
the contracts will be cash settled . 
SIMEX said in a statement that the index , to be traded on the floor of the exchange , would provide investors interested in the Taiwan bourse with good trading and hedging opportunities . 
international investors currently unable to trade on the Taiwan stock market would also find the contracts very good substitutes , SIMEX said . 
SIMEX was the first exchange to list a futures contract on the Japanese stock market , the Nikkei-225 futures and options contract .
