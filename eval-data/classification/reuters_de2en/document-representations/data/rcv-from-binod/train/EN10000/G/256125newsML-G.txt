Belgian police , acting on fresh information , started a new hunt on Friday in the Jumet suburb of the town of Charleroi for the bodies of some of the children who have gone missing over the past seven years . 
&quot; Based on information from some of the arrested people , and certain enquiries we have been able to make , we are convinced that here at Jumet ... not far from the tunnel we searched in September , there is another underground place where we may find traces of children or somewhere they were held , &quot; Gendarmerie Major Marcel Guissard told RTBF television . 
&quot; It is not impossible we might find bodies too , &quot; he added in response to a question . 
the hunt in September , based on information from chief suspect , convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux , found nothing . 
Belgium has been in shock since mid-August when Dutroux and several alleged accomplices were arrested . 
police rescued two young girls from a secret dungeon in the basement of a house owned by Dutroux in the Marcinelle suburb of Charleroi . 
both had been sexually abused . 
just two days later Dutroux led police to the bodies of two eight-year-old girls -- Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo -- buried alongside that of a former Dutroux accomplice Bernard Weinstein in the garden of another of six Dutroux homes in and around the town . 
the girls , missing for 14 months , had starved to death . 
less than three weeks later Dutroux led investigators to Weinstein &apos;s former house in Jumet where extensive digging unearthed the bodies of An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks who had been missing for a year . 
Dutroux , his second wife Michelle Martin , Michel Nihoul , Michel Lelievre and Mikael Diakostavrianos remain in prison while investigations continue . 
police , who are searching for at least another seven missing children , on Tuesday charged another man , Jacques Genevoix , in connection with the abduction in 1992 of a nine-year-old Moroccan girl , Loubna Benaissa .
