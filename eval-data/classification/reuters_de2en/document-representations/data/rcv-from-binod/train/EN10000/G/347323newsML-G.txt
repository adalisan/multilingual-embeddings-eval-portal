a lawyer for talk show host Oprah Winfrey branded as &quot; ridiculous &quot; Friday a $ 40 million lawsuit filed against her by an Ohio man who claimed she blocked him from selling his story about a 1985 relationship . 
&quot; This is a ridiculous lawsuit by yet another person trying to get money from Oprah , &quot; attorney Steven Molo said . 
in the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago , Randolph Cook , 39 , claimed Winfrey , who previously admitted to using cocaine in the 1970s , lived with him in Chicago between January and May of 1985 and the two abused drugs together . 
Molo said Cook and his lawyer telephoned Winfrey repeatedly after filing the suit Jan . 17 demanding $ 2 million from the television star . 
on Thursday , U.S. District Court Judge Charles Korcoras granted Molo &apos;s motion that Cook refrain from seeking any payments . 
the three-page type-written suit , filed by Cook himself without aid of a lawyer , sought punitive damages for slander and emotional distress . 
it claimed that Winfrey had blocked Cook &apos;s attempt to sell his story to a tabloid television show , or to publish a book about their supposed experiences .
