Ivorian 1996 / 97 cocoa arrivals stood at 710,000-720,000 tonnes by January 20 against 765,000 a year earlier , industry sources said . 
last season produced a record 1.2 million tonnes . 
&quot; We could see at the very least one million tonnes ( total 1996 / 97 ) , &quot; said one crop analyst commenting on the figures after a recent upcountry tour . 
&quot; Some people might be suprised when final forecasts are out . 
ivory Coast has forecast 950,000 tonnes for its main crop ( Oct-March ) and a smaller mid-crop ( April-Sept ) . 
private forecasters put the total at between 950,000 and 1.065 million tonnes . 
crop analysts are scouring plantations for confirmation of a long main crop and early indications of a large mid-crop . 
warehouses around ports are already full to capacity with cocoa . 
&quot; Although it is still early to say , on first sight we can expect a good mid-crop , &quot; said one crop analyst . 
&quot; pod count tallies were still being completed , but a total of even 1.1 million tonnes could not be discounted , he added . 
&quot; Rains have been normal for January , canopies are in generally good shape and there are plenty of early flowers and cherelles , &quot; said the analyst . 
there was likely to be less leaf flushing and better channelling of tree carbohydrates into flower and pod development , he added . 
weather data for Ivory Coast showed a jump in rainfall for the second 10 days of January after none in early January . 
that would help mid-crop pod development , particularly if light showers continued into February , the analyst said , adding that pod-count tallies were more important for estimating the mid-crop than for the main crop . 
&quot; We should have an idea by February . 
the pattern is not as visible as for the main crop , &quot; said the analyst . 
exporters told Reuters they also expected more than one million tonnes but did not specify precise tonnages . 
&quot; It is certainly better than some expected , &quot; said one . 
&quot; There &apos;s a lot of cocoa around but buyers now also have a large crop of coffee to off-load from up-country , &quot; said another . 
cocoa arrivals might dip temporarily but February would also be a strong month , he added . 
ivory cocoa warehouses were already seen at capacity levels , estimated to be at least 380,000-390,000 tonnes . 
the main crop is expected to last further into the new year than usual with less pronounced peak months . 
the January 20 arrivals figures included cumulative arrivals since October 1 at Abidjan and San Pedro . 
the season opened late on October 24 , by which time an estimated 50,000 tonnes of arrivals had been declared . 
comparisons with previous years have been made difficult by this , by erratic weather patterns and by a freight rate dispute in 1995 / 96 which skewed arrivals data . 
in 1994 / 95 arrivals stood at 640,000 tonnes by January 20 , leading to a season &apos;s total crop of around 870,000 tonnes . 
in 1995 / 96 , Ivory Coast produced an unprecendented 200 , OOO tonne mid-crop on top of a one million tonne main crop . 
&quot; That ( mid-crop ) could be matched . 
but now we must wait to see what reality our ( pod count ) figures show , &quot; said the crop analyst . 
there was no immediate breakdown of cocoa arrivals by port but industry source said San Pedro had taken around 220,000 tonnes with the remainder going to Abidjan .
