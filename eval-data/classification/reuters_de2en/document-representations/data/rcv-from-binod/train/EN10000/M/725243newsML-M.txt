Brent crude oil futures ended Monday over a quarter of a dollar lower after loosing ground earlier in the day on news of Iraq coming closer to oil sales and on details of timing and volume of upcoming German strategic crude oil sales , brokers said . 
August Brent closed on Monday down 27 cents at $ 17.82 a barrel . 
although the contract ended below support at $ 17.85 some brokers felt the downside had been overdone and expected a bounce on Tuesday . 
U.N. coordinator in Baghdad , Staffan De Mistura , said Monday that discussions about the Iraqi aid plan had been completed and that the plan will be submitted to the U.N. Secretary-General for final approval by next Monday . 
Iraq needed to complete an aid distribution plan before resuming oil sales under a deal with the U.N. that enables Iraq to sell $ 2 billion of oil every six months , on a renewable basis , in exchange for humanitarian aid . 
the second six month period was to start June 8 . 
&quot; I don &apos;t know if there is further downside once the timing of Iraqi exports comes out , but if the crude starts flowing early in August I would guess we &apos;ll see a drop in prices - maybe another 50 cents off , &quot; another broker said . 
news that about 2.8 million barrels of crude oil from the German strategic oil reserves will be sold in early August was not as bearish as originally thought , brokers said . 
&quot; Once the physical traders had time to look at it they started looking at the quality . 
it doesn &apos;t look like it will of very good quality as they have been topping it up with different sorts of crudes . 
we won &apos;t know until it &apos;s on a boat , &quot; one broker commented . 
the German Economics Ministry said the crude will be typically composed of 50 PCT Iranian Heavy , 25 PCT Arabian Light and 25 PCT Iraqi Kirkuk . 
the combination of these two pieces of news knocked over half a dollar off the prompt Brent contract earlier . 
August Brent traded on Monday up to a high of $ 18.45 a barrel . 
August gas oil closed a few hours earlier down some $ 1.25 a tonne at $ 160.50 a tonne . 
the contract was due to open on Tuesday off a further 50 cents to $ 1 on the basis of the Brent and NYMEX heating oil closing levels .
