Egyptian share prices closed lower on Sunday after profit-taking infiltrated some sectors of the market and dampened weeks of racing to record highs . 
the Capital Market Authority ( CMA ) said the bourse &apos;s all-share index slipped 0.07 percent to 422.43 points after trading worth 107.22 million pounds ( $ 31.58 million ) . 
&quot; Demand is beginning to slacken and the clearing house is being a bit slow nowadays about giving people their money so they &apos;re not buying , &quot; said broker Mohammed Magdy of Hermes-EFG . 
&quot; People with big portfolios are beginning to sell in some sectors after the recent rise , so it &apos;s a natural correction . 
but other shares are not that affected , &quot; he added . 
brokers said investors were still keen on the cements , mainstay of the Cairo bourse , particularly after an HSBC James Capel report said Amriyah cement and Helwan Portland cement were the best performing in their sector . 
&quot; The report certainly whipped up trading in Amriyah . 
it &apos;s very encouraging , &quot; Magdy said . 
the stock was the day &apos;s most actively-traded , rising 2 pounds to 90 after shares worth 7.7 million changed hands . 
Helwan was the next best performer , gaining 1.5 to 79 pounds in 4.6 million pound turnover . 
HSBC James Capel &apos;s not-too-optimistic forecast on the performance of Suez cement also pushed shares 1.51 pound lower to 76 pounds . 
several milling shares were also unaffected by the downtrend . 
North Cairo flour Mills rose 3 pounds to 202 while Central and West Delta flour Mills added 2.49 to close at 126 pounds in busy trading . 
related firm General silos and Storage also rose 5.31 to 111.63 . 
buying remained heavy in the banking sector with investors mainly setting their sights on Commerical International Bank ( CIB ) and Misr International Bank / MIBANK . 
brokers also said investors appeared to have lost faith in Eipico / Egyptian International Pharmaceutical Industries and the stock closed down 6.48 to 123.25 pounds in 7.04 pounds worth of trading . 
bourse officials cancelled for legal reasons what would have been the day &apos;s biggest trade , the transfer of Food Industries Development ( Bim Bim ) stock to Britain &apos;s Cadbury Schweppes plc which bought the candy firm last month . 
brokers said the firm had not informed the bourse in writing before transfering the stocks , a procedure required for the transfer of 20 percent or more of a firm &apos;s equity . 
the index for openly traded firms fell to 732.91 points from 736.84 points on Thursday while the index for rarely traded &quot; closed &quot; firms rose slightly to 270.73 points from 269.99 . 
out of the 85 shares traded , 38 gained , 34 lost and 13 ended the day unchanged .
