Robusta coffee futures headed lower in solid afternoon trade on Wednesday in a milder reflection of the gyrations of the arabicas market , beset by supply fears and low stocks . 
during London &apos;s session , New York &apos;s key July contract see-sawed in a wide range between 248.50 and 236.00 cents per lb and traders said prices in London were also erratic but were not so volatile . 
&quot; It &apos;s unreal ... people can &apos;t take a daily view on this market , they have to take an hourly view , &quot; said one . 
Roasters dominated on the buy side in London , although trade and speculative interest was also noted . 
trade players were the day &apos;s prominent sellers . 
earlier in the day , origin offers capped the gains racked up by the July robusta contract , which surged nearly four percent to score a fresh one-year high on fund buying and manufacturer position-covering . 
&quot; Overall the picture is still looking very rosy and you have to go with the flow . 
everything is still pointing higher , &quot; the trader said , adding that Brazil &apos;s frost season was still some way away . 
both markets are bracing for frost scares from Brazil as winter sets in from late May . 
at the close benchmark July was up $ 53 at $ 1,870 after its earlier peak of $ 1,885 . 
all positions ended firmer and overall volume amounted to 8,836 lots . 
traders said robustas were poised for further upward progress , with July &apos;s initial upside objective seen at between $ 1,920 and $ 1,930 . 
support was seen intact at $ 1,800 . 
in other news , Ivory Coast &apos;s commodities Minister said in an interview coffee output in the Oct / Sept 1996 / 97 season would be less than 300,000 tonnes .
