a key central bank survey showed on Wednesday that big Japanese manufacturers grew surprisingly optimistic this month , fuelling speculation that the Bank of Japan may move sooner rather than later to tighten credit . 
but non-manufacturers and smaller firms remained less cheery , and some analysts said the central bank would wait for a broader recovery before raising interest rates . 
the diffusion index for big manufacturers , a key gauge of business confidence in the Bank of Japan &apos;s quarterly &quot; tankan &quot; survey , rose to plus seven in June from plus two in March , when the previous survey was conducted . 
the key figure was stronger than expected and caused a frenzy on financial markets , battering the dollar and bond prices but igniting a rally in Tokyo stocks . 
&quot; To say the report is an eye-popper is an understatement , &quot; said Jane Berryman , a senior analyst at Technical Data in Tokyo . 
the tankan also forecast that the cheerful mood would persist , predicting that the major manufacturers &apos; index would rise to plus eight in September . 
the March tankan had forecast a manufacturers &apos; diffusion index of minus one for June . 
private economists &apos; forecasts had ranged from minus four to plus four and many market players were expecting sentiment to worsen . 
the diffusion index for major non-manufacturers , meanwhile , slipped a bit to minus seven in June from minus six in March , while the index for small manufacturers improved marginally to minus seven from minus eight . 
the index represents the percentage of companies which see business conditions as favourable minus the percentage of those viewing conditions as unfavourable . 
markets have been anxious to see the tankan data for clues to when the Bank of Japan is likely to tighten its hyper-easy credit stance , in place since the central bank slashed its key official discount rate to 0.5 percent in September 1995 to keep the struggling economy on track . 
most economists had been expecting the Bank of Japan to wait until at least October and possibly until next year before raising interest rates , although some have said the central bank could move as early as August . 
the stronger-than-expected numbers sent the dollar down about one yen to 113.80 yen in morning Tokyo trade . 
the key March euroyen futures contract fell sharply and Japanese government bond prices sank . 
&quot; It is highly likely that we could see a rate rise in the latter half of the year , probably the fourth quarter , if we get a confirmation of today &apos;s message in the September tankan itself , &quot; said Technical Data &apos;s Berryman . 
&quot; Clearly it &apos;s stronger than we thought ... you have to move forward expectations of a tightening of credit . 
economists said the tankan data showed big manufacturers were benefitting from robust overseas demand for their exports but noted that a gap remained between nimble manufacturers and more sluggish non-manufacturing and smaller firms . 
&quot; The Bank of Japan is going to want to see a broadening out of the recovery . 
it will take the September and December tankan -- two consecutive tankan showing an improvement in the service sector and the small and medium-sized sector -- before they can seriously justify ( a rate hike ) . 
I think the rate hike will come in exactly six months , &quot; said Jesper Koll , chief economist at JP Morgan in Tokyo .
