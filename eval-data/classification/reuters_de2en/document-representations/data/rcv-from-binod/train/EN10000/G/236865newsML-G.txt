a submission to the Living Wage case by the A-L-P has called for an annual safety net wage rise for low-paid workers half way between what the A-C-T-U &apos;s demanding , and the Government &apos;s offering .

resources and Energies Minister Warwick Parer says the new technology is essential considering most large mineral deposits protruding to the surface have been found . 
Senator Parer says the 75 million dollar cost of producing the map is an investment in Australia &apos;s 40 billion dollar mining exports industry .

Republican Chair Malcolm Turnbull says a People &apos;s Convention will be useful only if the participants are elected , otherwise it &apos;ll be a politicians &apos; convention and won &apos;t have any legitimacy . 
he &apos;s urging the Federal Government to take up the Opposition &apos;s suggestion .
