the Bulgarian Lev closed at 652-658 per dollar , virtually unchanged from the morning &apos;s 650-660 but down from the previous close at 635-640 due to the longer value date of spot deals , dealers said . 
&quot; The Lev held steady throughout the day as interbank dollar demand and supply were balanced in a lively trade , &quot; a dealer said . 
the Lev &apos;s fall was solely due to the longer value date of spot-deals , traders said . 
the current large spread between interest rates on lev- and dollar-denominated deposits allows for a daily dollar rise by two to three levs , traders said . 
the Bulgarian National Bank ( BNB ) central interest rate is now set at 15.0 percent monthly or 180.0 percent annually . 
the BNB was not seen buying dollars on Wednesday , dealers said .
