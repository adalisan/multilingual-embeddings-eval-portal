Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri said on Thursday that alleged Red Army guerrillas arrested in Beirut last month would be tried and would serve their sentences in Lebanon . 
&quot; The Japanese government confirmed to us that those Japanese were from the Red Army , &quot; Hariri told reporters after meeting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak . 
&quot; They violated the Lebanese law ... and consequently they will be tried ( in Lebanon ) , and if they are sentenced , they will serve the sentences in Lebanon and after that we will take a decision , &quot; he added . 
Lebanese authorities charged the five with passport forgery and other offences carrying up to 10 years in jail . 
one of them told a Lebanese paper they would commit suicide in jail if Lebanon decided to hand them over to Japan . 
Lebanon and Japan do not have an extradition agreement .
