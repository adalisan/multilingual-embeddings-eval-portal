gasoline firmed on Wednesday with a Japanese trader still showing buying interest in the Singapore fob market . 
the trader bought two 50,000-barrel cargoes of 97-octane at $ 28.80 and $ 28.75 per barrel fob Singapore lifting April 10-14 , 20-24 from a U.S. major and a Dutch trader respectively . 
on Tuesday , the Japanese trader had bought the same grade at $ 28.55 , lifting April 8-11 . 
traders assessed the gasoline market as balanced to slightly long with clean storage in Singapore being occupied mainly by gas oil . 
regional demand was lacklustre although some reformate was being sought into Japan due to refinery turnarounds starting in April , traders said . 
only the low octane grades were in good demand with Vietnam &apos;s and Pakistan &apos;s tenders closing end of the month . 
traders expected Pakistan &apos;s import tender to provide support . 
Pakistan &apos;s Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources brought forward its June requirement to May for two 25,000-tonne cargoes of 80 and 87-octane gasoline . 
high offers in its second quarter tender prompted the ministry to issue the latest tender , which closes March 31 and is valid until April 5 . 
Pakistan had received offers of $ 30 per tonne over Mideast naphtha quotes c-and-f , nearly double its premium of $ 16.745 per tonne it paid for first quarter purchases , sources said . 
Naphtha swaps were marginally lower with April swaps last quoted at $ 22.95 / $ 23.10 per barrel , from $ 23.05 / $ 23.25 on Tuesday .
