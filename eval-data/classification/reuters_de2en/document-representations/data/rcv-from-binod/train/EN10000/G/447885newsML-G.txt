moderate Tony Blair came from nowhere to shake up Britain &apos;s Labour Party . 
now , three years later , he wants to take charge of the country and ensure &quot; New Labour , New Britain &quot; becomes not just a campaign slogan but a clarion call for the new millenium . 
few politicians see any stopping him -- even those charged with beating him at the May 1 general election . 
&quot; If Blair turns out to be as good as he looks , we have a problem , &quot; the then Conservative deputy chairman John Maples conceded in a leaked memo as Blair rose to prominence . 
nowadays , opinion polls showing Blair &apos;s party around 20 percentage points ahead look good indeed . 
more importantly for an electorate seemingly raring for change , Blair looks different from Prime Minister John Major , dubbed the &quot; grey man &quot; of British politics . 
while Major , 53 , is a working class boy made good at the top of a Conservative party built on wealth and privilege , Blair , 43 , was groomed for success at a leading Scottish private school and Oxford University before becoming a lawyer . 
voters know the telegenic &quot; leader-in-waiting &quot; married a woman his equal -- Cherie Booth is a successful lawyer . 
nor is he the sort to share beer and sandwiches with the trade unionists who for so long held Labour in a vice-like grip , although he does enjoy a pint and takeaway fish and chips . 
he is thoroughly modern : a good communicator , conservative with a small c &apos; who appeals to the masses who migrated to the large &quot; C &quot; Conservatives . 
like U.S. President Bill Clinton , he comes from the moderate wing of his party and is distrusted by the old party faithful . 
he has shaken off Labour &apos;s old socialist tenets , loosened ties with the trade unions and adopted tougher social policies . 
he says he remains a socialist but not one which believes the state should intervene widely in British life . 
like Clinton , Blair is a &quot; new man &quot; who is not ashamed of raw emotions , fresh thinking and crusading moral agendas . 
a die-hard moderate , Blair is also a Christian : a man his spin-doctors say can be trusted by a nation leery of the left . 
&quot; He is the worst thing that could happen to us , &quot; a Conservative minister once confessed . 
nobody could have guessed as much when the sudden death of populist Labour leader John Smith in 1994 paved the way for Blair &apos;s rise to power from virtual obscurity . 
indeed , the Daily Telegraph newspaper had once damned Blair as &quot; too nice and too unguarded to be a politician &quot; . 
Anthony Charles Lynton Blair was born in Edinburgh in 1953 , the son of an aspiring Conservative politician . 
he was brought up in the northeast of England and remains the representative in parliament for his old Sedgefield home . 
aged 11 , Blair stood as the Conservative candidate in a mock school election and it was not until university that he showed any inclination towards the left . 
educated at Fettes , an exclusive Scottish private school in Edinburgh , he read law at Oxford and went on to become a barrister in London specialising in trade union law . 
aged 14 , he tried to flee the country rather than return to his strict private school , dubbed the Eton of Scotland . 
&quot; It was one of the craziest things I &apos;ve ever done , &quot; he said recently of his abortive attempt to visit the Bahamas . 
at Oxford University , Blair &apos;s rebellious streak continued as he fronted a rock &apos; n &apos; roll band called &quot; The Ugly Rumours &quot; , grew his hair long and dressed up in garish 1970s fashions . 
his style was pure Mick Jagger and while he didn &apos;t have the lips to match the Rolling Stone , Blair was a big hit with women . 
but his mind was really on other things as the man who would be Labour &apos;s youngest leader embraced socialism and Christianity . 
&quot; Blair was essentially a rather sensible young man . 
discreet about sex , abstemious about drugs and earnest about rock &apos; n &apos; roll , &quot; said John Rentoul , Blair &apos;s biographer . 
this sensible streak served him well . 
in 1983 , four years after Labour was last in government , Blair won a safe Labour seat and began his speedy rise through party ranks , speaking as opposition Treasury spokesman , formulating party policy on trade unions and tackling the tricky home affairs portfolio . 
when Smith died of a heart attack , Blair was by no means the automatic choice to succeed him . 
Gordon Brown , the party &apos;s economics spokesman and Smith &apos;s right-hand man , looked the logical choice . 
Brown and Blair thrashed it out as friends and rivals . 
it was the fresh-faced Blair who won -- so fresh-faced that none of of his inner circle even has experience of office . 
Blair is not fazed . 
dismissed as a man who didn &apos;t know his mind to one who imposed his will ruthlessly , Blair has found his footing and can now joke about the tags earned along the way . 
hard for me sometimes , &quot; he said at one Labour Party Conference . 
&quot; Last year Bambi , this year Stalin . 
from Disneyland to dictatorship in 12 short months . 
jokes aside , his speeches largely focus on his vision for &quot; a nation reborn . 
prosperous , secure , united &quot; -- in short , a nation that fits perfectly with a Labour Party that is now reborn . 
allies say he is petulant under fire and has a tendency to exaggerate any setback . 
but he also has a doggedness that served his political nemesis Margaret Thatcher so well -- and a will to succeed that ensured she governed Britain for 11 years . 
&quot; Thatcher is his model . 
and she once said that her single greatest success was the change she had brought about in the Labour Party . 
that &apos;s also Tony Blair &apos;s job -- in reverse , of course , &quot; said Jonathan Powell , Blair &apos;s chief of staff .
