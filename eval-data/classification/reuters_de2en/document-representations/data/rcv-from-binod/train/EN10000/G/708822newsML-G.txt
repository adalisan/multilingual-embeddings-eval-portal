Camilla Parker Bowles , lover of Britain &apos;s royal heir Prince Charles , was driven to the brink of suicide after he admitted their adultery in a television interview , a Sunday newspaper said . 
she thought she had been abandoned by Charles after the 1994 interview and feared she had become the most hated woman in Britain , the Sunday Mirror said . 
Parker Bowles provoked widespread public hostility as the woman who caused the breakdown of Charles &apos; 15-year marriage to Princess Diana , which ended in divorce in 1996 . 
Camilla is the subject of a documentary to be shown on British television on Sunday , which has prompted speculation that Britain is being prepared for her to play a more public role at Charles &apos;s side . 
until now she has said nothing in public about her long-running relationship with Charles , but some of her supporters have said the two divorcees should now be allowed to marry . 
the Sunday Mirror said the prince had subsequently told Camilla that he dared not contact her after the interview because her home was surrounded by photographers and he feared that a telephone call might be intercepted . 
his fears followed the allegedly bugged &quot; Camillagate &quot; tapes of a late-night intimate conversation he had had with her in 1989 . 
the Sunday Mirror quoted a source close to Camilla as saying she was &quot; desperately unhappy and afraid &quot; after the prince &apos;s public admission . 
the source added : &quot; I can tell you that putting an end to it all crossed her mind more than once . 
the Mail on Sunday newspaper said the prince had cancelled plans for a summer holiday in the Mediterranean with Camilla . 
Charles was said to be worried about criticism of the couple over Sunday &apos;s television programme and he felt the time was not right to make their affair more public , the paper said .
