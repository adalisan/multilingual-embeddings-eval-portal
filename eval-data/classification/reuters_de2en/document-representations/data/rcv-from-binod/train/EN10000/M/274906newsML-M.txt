CSCE coffee futures rose Tuesday in a shortened pre-holiday session , as dealers ignored supply figures showing a sharp build in exchange-certified stocks . 
U.S. certified coffee inventories climbed by 21,744 bags in the week ended December 20 , to 34,315 bags , as Latin American growers stepped up shipments to the U.S. 
while the figures were expected to keep prices under pressure , traders said a round of position adjustments by speculators ahead of the holidays gave the market a small boost today . 
at some point , the stock figures may trigger a delayed sell off , he said , but the market was unlikely to make any decisive move until after the New Year &apos;s Day holiday . 
March coffee rose 1.65 cent per lb on the day , to 114.75 , after briefly touching a high of 115 , a key psychological resistance level . 
with many operators already sidelined ahead of Christmas , trading in the truncated session was relatively thin . 
volume reached an estimated 4,240 lots . 
the CSCE will be closed Wednesday , December 25 , and Thursday , December 26 , in observance of Christams .
