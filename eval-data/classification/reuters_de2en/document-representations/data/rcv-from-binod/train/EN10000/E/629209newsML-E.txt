a senior Australian Treasury official on Tuesday forecast solid retail activity . 
&quot; The most accurate description is to look at the ABS ( Australian Bureau of Statistics ) retail trade data , which shows that retail has grown by 2.2 percent in real terms in the first three months of &apos; 97 and that the pace of activity looks like it &apos;s going to remain reasonably solid , in line with the expected growth in income , &quot; Treasury forecaster Martin Parkinson told a Senate committee . 
&quot; But I think reasonably solid growth in the region of three-quarters of a percent , a percent quarter on average over the next year is the sort of numbers you &apos;d be looking at ( for private consumption ) , &quot; he said .
