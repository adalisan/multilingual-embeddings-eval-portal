Australian bond yield spreads narrowed slightly to North American debt as the local market continued to be supported by expectations of a local rate cut . 
in the lead up to what are expected to be favourable inflation and wages data next week , spreads are expected to remain well supported , and most likely hold a narrowing bias . 
once the data is released , there is potential for spreads to narrow further , possibly to parity with the U.S. at the long end , analysts said . 
&quot; Running through the inflation data later this month , Australian 10-year bonds could trade at yield par with U.S. treasuries and the local 10-year bond yield may push below 6.5 percent , &quot; UBS Australia chief economist Stephen Roberts said . 
economists surveyed by Reuters expect the underlying inflation rate , which the Reserve Bank targets , to fall to 1.7 percent in annual terms . 
not only would this be below the RBA &apos;s two to three percent target range , but it would also be the lowest underlying rate in the series history , which dates back to the early 1970s . 
as well , the consumer price index is forecast to be flat in the quarter and up only 0.6 percent over the year . 
finally average weekly ordinary time earnings are expected to rise just 0.8 percent in the quarter , for annual growth of 4.1 percent -- underneath the RBA &apos;s 4.5 percent comfort zone . 
spreads were flat to slightly wider against New Zealand , which is waiting on June quarter inflation figures on Tuesday .
