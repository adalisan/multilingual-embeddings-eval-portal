following is a selection of economists &apos; reactions to data showing UK GDP grew a preliminary 0.8 PCT in the fourth quarter of 1996 from the third quarter and was up 2.6 PCT from a year earlier , excctly in line with consensus forecasts . 
&quot; Almost entirely in line with expectations right across the board . 
we wouldn &apos;t expect to see too much of a market impact after this . 
&quot; If this were an absolutely reliable figure , then there is no need for an interest rate rise . 
but it &apos;s very difficult to reconcile what is going on , apparently , in the labour market with such weak numbers . 
my very strong suspicion is that there will be some upward revisions to the data , not only for this fourth quarter but in fact for the whole of 1996 . 
I reckon we will see that 1996 , in retrospect , was a year of quite fast and accelerating growth . 
&quot; The figures were in line with market expectations , though a touch stronger than we expected . 
the main reason for that is that construction output was pretty strong . 
it leaves the interest rate decision on February 5 a bit more in balance than if it had come in as we expected ... but on balance , given that the data over the last three to four weeks have been weaker than expected , I think Clarke will probably leave rates unchanged on February 5 . 
&quot; The data was as expected really ... there were no great surprises , the service sector is leading the way . 
the real question is whether growth accelerates into 1997 which we believe it will do . 
we think the strong consumer will continue to drive the economy forward , notwithstanding the weak retail sales data we had last week . 
a batch of data suggests rates will now be on hold ahead of the election ... but that &apos;s only deferring the inevitable . 
but it is useful for a Chancellor who has got to go to the polls in less than four months &apos; time .
