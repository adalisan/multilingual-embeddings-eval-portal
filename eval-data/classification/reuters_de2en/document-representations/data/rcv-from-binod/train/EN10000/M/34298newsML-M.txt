Hungary &apos;s forint closed on Thursday slightly firmer against the dollar on a market where forint supply was thin and players were expecting a reverse repo rate cut , dealers said . 
&quot; There is little forint on the market , even the ( overnight ) interest rates have gone up recently , &quot; ABN AMRO Bank &apos;s Zoltan Szaloky said . 
the forint finished at 151.47 / 52 against the dollar , compared with its 151.50 / 55 opening . 
the forint traded in sporadic deals some 10 fillers weaker than the National Bank of Hungary &apos;s resistance ( bid ) . 
but by the end of the session the forint was pushed up to the NBH bid by a shortage of forint or client orders , dealers said . 
much forint has flowed into reverse repo deals with the NBH recently , as the market was awaiting a reverse repo rate cut , which could happen next week , Szaloky added . 
interest rates futures on the Budapest commodity Exchange , which trade rarely , ( BCE ) dropped . 
September futures slipped to 22.02 percent from 22.05 , the December ones to 21.08 from 21.14 . 
the dollar fell for almost all maturities in futures deals by five to 40 fillers . 
the mark and the yen closed mixed , while the Ecu finished stable to firmer .
