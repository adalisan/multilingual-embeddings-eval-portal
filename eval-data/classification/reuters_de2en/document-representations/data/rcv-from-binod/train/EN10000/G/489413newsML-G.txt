German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel criticised Turkish political leaders on Saturday for anti-German remarks made after an arson attack that killed three Turks in Krefeld , Germany last Monday . 
&quot; unacceptable comments from the Turkish side are not needed , &quot; Kinkel said according to an advance text of the Sunday newspaper Welt am Sonntag . 
Kinkel said Turkish leaders should refrain from making hasty accusations after police determined the fatal fire that Turkish prime minister , Necmettin Erbakan , had blamed on rising anti-Moslem sentiment in the West was started by a Turkish man . 
&quot; This sort of megaphone-diplomacy leads nowhere . 
it only destroys ties that have been built up over a long period of time , &quot; Kinkel told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper , referring to Erbakan &apos;s comments as well as remarks by Turkey &apos;s Interior Minister Meral Aksener . 
Aksener was quoted by the semi-official Anatolian news agency as saying on Thursday that &quot; they ( Germans ) couldn &apos;t throw us out , now they are trying to burn us out &quot; . 
police , who had said during their investigation there was no evidence of a racist attack , announced on Friday they believed the fire in which a woman and her two children perished was deliberately set by her husband , whom she planned to divorce . 
the German government summoned Turkey &apos;s ambassador to protest at the criticism from Ankara . 
&quot; Germany and Turkey are important partners for each other , &quot; Kinkel said . 
&quot; Turks living in Germany are welcome and can count on the state to protect them , &quot; he added . 
the unusually strong language from Germany &apos;s top diplomat came as Focus news magazine reported the Bonn government was considering withdrawing an invitation to Erbakan to visit Germany in the autumn . 
the magazine quoted government sources in Bonn saying that &quot; without an adequate signal of regret &quot; from Erbakan , it would be &quot; unimaginable &quot; that Kohl would see Erbakan . 
police in the town of Krefeld said the dead woman &apos;s 42-year-old husband was remanded in custody on suspicion of starting the fire . 
Walter Seifert , the head of Krefeld &apos;s murder squad , said an eyewitness had seen the suspect filling a canister with petrol at a filling station . 
Seifert said investigations indicated that the suspect had regularly beaten his wife and children and brought a prostitute to live in the apartment for a time . 
he said the wife had planned to sue for divorce in the next few days . 
the wife was fatally injured when she jumped from their third-floor in the town centre . 
a 16-year-old daughter died in hospital from injuries and a 17-year-old son was found dead in the building . 
two other daughters also jumped from the flat and were severely injured . 
Erbakan &apos;s comments had fuelled a war of words between Turkey and Germany , which is particularly sensitive to such accusations that it is soft on racism after working hard to quell an upsurge of anti-foreigner attacks after unification in 1990 . 
more than 30 people died then , among them five Turkish women and children in a single attack in Solingen in 1993 . 
Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen , the German government &apos;s ombudsman for foreign affairs , warned that the &quot; totally exaggerated &quot; reaction in Turkey to the fire could have a negative impact on German-Turk relations in Germany .
