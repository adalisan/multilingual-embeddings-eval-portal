a Bosnian Croat general , accused of directing a brutal ethnic cleansing campaign , on Tuesday became the highest-ranking suspect to go on trial at the U.N. war crimes tribunal in the Hague . 
Tihomir Blaskic , 36 , appeared before the court charged with crimes against humanity committed against Moslems in central Bosnia from 1992 to 1994 , when he was a colonel commanding Bosnian Croat ( HVO ) militia forces . 
he denies the charges . 
a slight figure in glasses and a grey suit , Blaskic , a father of two young sons , stood to identify himself before a panel comprising Judges Claude Jorda of France , Fouad Riad of Egypt and Mohamed Shahabuddeen of Guyana . 
asked his occupation , he replied : &quot; I am a professional officer of the Croatian army . 
the tribunal alleges Blaskic led murderous ethnic cleansing drives in Bosnia &apos;s Lasva Valley region , where hundreds of civilians were killed during the destruction of Moslem villages . 
&quot; Whole Moslem villages were razed to the ground and their populations driven out of the territory he controlled ... employing methods no responsible military commander would condone , &quot; U.S. prosecutor Mark Harmon told the court . 
in one such attack , on the Moslem village of Ahmici , the tribunal said nearly 100 people , including women and children , were killed . 
the indictment alleges grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions governing conduct in wartime and violations of the laws and customs of war , as well as crimes against humanity . 
Blaskic voluntarily surrendered to the tribunal in April 1996 and has been held under house arrest at a secret Hague location since then . 
&quot; All of us here ... wish to ensure that General Blaskic enjoys an impartial and fair trial which takes place in a reasonable time frame , &quot; Presiding Judge Jorda said , urging both sets of counsel to proceed as quickly as possible with the case . 
&quot; Justice which seems to be endless will not meet the expectations of international public opinion and ... would also not satisfy the rights of the accused . 
the case has created tension between the tribunal and Croatia , which has stood behind Blaskic . 
he was promoted to a senior post in Croatia &apos;s regular army after his indictment for war crimes and decorated by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman for war service , drawing international criticism . 
Bosnian Moslems and Croats in the Lasva Valley region fought side-by-side against separatist Serb forces when civil war first broke out in Yugoslavia in 1992 , but the alliance collapsed in 1993 as they turned their guns on each other in a bitter territorial struggle . 
both sides swapped accusations of gruesome massacres as villages were torched and people driven from their homes . 
the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has indicted 75 war crimes suspects -- 54 Serbs ( one of whom has since died ) , 18 Croats and three Moslems -- but only eight are in its custody . 
it has no police force and relies on the former Yugoslav republics , other states or the international peace force ( SFOR ) in Bosnia to make arrests . 
the two most prominent indicted suspects are former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic , both of whom remain at large .
