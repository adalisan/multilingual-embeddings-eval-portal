blue-chip stocks jumped Wednesday as Wall Street was relieved that the Federal Reserve saw no clear sign of inflation , putting the Dow Jones industrial average just shy of a new record high . 
the Dow Jones ended up 27.74 points at 5,754.92 , not far from its record close of 5,778.00 set on May 22 . 
in the broader market , advancing issues led declines 1,237 to 1,015 on active trading of 375 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
&quot; The bounce in the market is closely tied to the Beige Book . 
there was relief it was not stronger than it was and now people are back to thinking a 25 basis point tightening or no change , &quot; said Michael LaTronica , director of research at Gruntal &amp; Co . 
the Fed in its so-called Beige Book report said the economy seemed to be expanding moderately with no clear sign of higher inflation , although wages appeared to be on the upswing . 
the report was based on information collected before Sept . 4 in the 12 Fed districts and will be used when central bank policymakers meet on Sept . 24 to plot interest-rate strategy . 
analysts said the Fed &apos;s findings seemed to reinforce Wall Street &apos;s belief that the central bank will need to increase interest rates only modestly , if at all . 
the inflation-sensitive bond market held steady with the 30-year Treasury bond &apos;s yield at Tuesday &apos;s close of 7.11 percent . 
traders were also bracing for the August Producer Price Index on Thursday , which is forecast up 0.1 percent for both core and overall rates , against an unchanged overall rate in July and an 0.1-percent rise in the core rate . 
on Friday , the Consumer Price Index is expected to show an increase of 0.2 percent in the core and overall rates versus an 0.3-percent rise in July . 
&quot; We &apos;ll have a much better reading on inflation and whether the Fed will raise rates after PPI and CPI , &quot; said Phil Orlando , chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management . 
added LaTronica , &quot; We want to see Thursday and Friday &apos;s numbers but the consensus is we &apos;re on a pace for a 2.7 percent CPI-base inflation for the year , which is pretty benign . 
with unemployment nationally at a seven-year low of 5.1 percent and even lower in some parts of the country , Wall Street has weighed the threat that a tightening labour market could help drive up wages , and rekindle inflation pressures . 
stocks got a lift after the Investment Company Institute estimated that new cash flows into stock funds were $ 19.0 billion in August , a jump from July &apos;s $ 5.8 billion and a return to the record pace of earlier in 1996 .
