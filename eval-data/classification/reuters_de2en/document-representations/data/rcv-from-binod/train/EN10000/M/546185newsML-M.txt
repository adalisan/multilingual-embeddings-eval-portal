dirty tanker rates were little changed in quiet to moderate activity , brokers said . 
&quot; It &apos;s utterly dead , &quot; said one broker , referring to the Middle East very large crude carrier ( VLCC ) market . 
he said rates to most destinations remained stuck at W47.5 for 250,000 tonners , so far confounding predictions that levels would start to firm after last week &apos;s fall as the number of available vessels declined . 
one of the few reported Mideast fixtures was the 230,000 tonne Athenian Splendour , done at W52.5 Mideast / Thailand , loading May 21 for Thai Oil . 
West Africa / U.S. 
Gulf VLCCs were no livelier , and were flat at about W62.5. 
&quot; West Africa &apos;s going down , &quot; another broker said , citing last week &apos;s force majeure on Nigerian bonny and Forcados as a contributory factor . 
the Mediterranean 80,000 tonne market was perhaps the only sector to show much sign of life , firming to W110 / 112.5 from W105 on a lack of tonnage , brokers said . 
but an Italian broker noted this sector tends to be volatile and he did not believe that the increase in rates heralded a steadily firming market . 
at least one VLCC was fixed from the Med to the north . 
the 290,000 tonne Karoline which fetched W60 on a Sidi Kreir / UKC voyage , loading May 31 for Exxon . 
the Med 130,000 tonne ( Suezmax ) market was moderately busy , with the rate steady at W90 / 92.5 , brokers said . 
Inter-U.K. / CONT 80,000 tonne cargoes were steady to slightly lower at W90 / 92.5 , some 10 points down from mid-April , and 25,000 tonnes of fuel oil was unchanged at W195 . 
but cross-Med fuel oil dipped to W190 from W195 , brokers said . 
in the Caribs / upcoast market , 70,000 tonne crude cargoes were steady at W185 , with 50,000 tonnes of fuel oil little changed at W170 / 175 .
