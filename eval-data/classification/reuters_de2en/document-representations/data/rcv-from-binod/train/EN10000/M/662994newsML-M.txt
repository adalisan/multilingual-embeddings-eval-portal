of the first two July Brent cargoes to turn wet on Monday one was kept and the other five o &apos; clocked , traders said . 
one of the July 1-3 loading cargoes was heard kept by Statsco while the other was clocked to Koch , traders said . 
Brent cargoes are traded on a paper , or forward market until the 1700 London time deadline on the nearest trading day 15 days before their assigned loading date . 
a trading company is clocked when it is left with a paper cargo which has turned physical after that deadline and therefore cannot be passed on as part of pre-sold paper cargo deals .
