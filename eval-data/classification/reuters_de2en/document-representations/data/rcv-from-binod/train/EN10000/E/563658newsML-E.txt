Britain &apos;s new government astounded financial markets Tuesday by announcing that it would give the Bank of England freedom to set interest rates . 
Chancellor of the Exchequer ( finance minister ) Gordon Brown raised interest rates to 6.25 percent from 6 percent to keep inflation under control -- but declared that his first monetary decision would also be his last . 
&quot; We must remove the suspicion that short-term party-political considerations are influencing the setting of interest rates , &quot; he told his first news conference after the Labour Party &apos;s landslide election victory on May 1 . 
&quot; I have , therefore , decided to give the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting interest rates , with immediate effect . 
Brown &apos;s dramatic decision to relinquish one of his key powers sent London stock prices rocketing , while the pound sterling firmed to a four-year high against the German mark . 
British government bond prices also surged . 
prior to the major reform announced Tuesday , the Bank of England was considered one of the least independent central banks among Group of Seven industrial nations . 
Central bank policy structures and legal statutes throughout the G7 give most other central banks looser ties to their respective governments . 
but now the powers granted by Britain &apos;s new Labour government bring the Bank closer to the norm in the G7 . 
however , economists said the decision did not satisfy the criteria for joining a single European currency . 
&quot; The Bank has to be made entirely independent and the government has retained its right to issue instructions , &quot; said Graham Bishop , adviser on European financial affairs at Salomon Brothers . 
&quot; This is a building block , a launch pad . 
Brown told the news conference it was unlikely that Britain would join the proposed single European currency in the first wave of nations in 1999 . 
until now , Britain &apos;s Chancellors of the Exchequer have set monetary policy after hearing advice from the Bank of England . 
Bank Governor Eddie George had been calling for higher interest rates since December , but the prior Conservative government &apos;s chancellor , Kenneth Clarke , had rejected his advice , prompting accusations that he did not want to risk upsetting voters ahead of the election by making home mortgages more expensive . 
Brown &apos;s reforms went much further than those he had outlined before the election , when he said he would not propose early operational independence for the Bank . 
&quot; We will only build a fully credible framework for monetary policy if the long-term needs of the economy , not short-term political considerations , guide monetary decision-making , &quot; Brown said Tuesday . 
&quot; I want Britain &apos;s economic success to be built on the solid rock of prudent and consistent economic management , not the shifting sands of boom and bust . 
&quot; This is the time to set the British economy on a new long-term course that will deliver high levels of growth and employment through lasting stability . 
the new chancellor , who had promised he would &quot; hit the ground running , &quot; said he had decided to raise interest rates because of rapid growth in consumer spending and average earnings , rising house prices and strong growth in money supply . 
&quot; My judgment is that we have inherited a situation in which , in the absence of corrective action , inflation will overshoot the government &apos;s inflation target next year , &quot; he said . 
Brown said that in the future , British interest rates will be set at a monthly meeting of a new nine-member monetary policy committee , including four members from outside the Bank of England .
