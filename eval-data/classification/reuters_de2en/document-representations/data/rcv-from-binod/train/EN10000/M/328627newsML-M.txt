major European bourses climbed to record levels on Thursday as a strong opening on Wall Street bolstered earlier gains inspired by favourable currency movements . 
London stocks stormed ahead over one percent to a new trading peak as a suddenly weakening pound boosted prospects for exporting companies after the currency &apos;s recent steep gains . 
Frankfurt closed at an all-time high as the dollar dug in at a 2-1 / 2 year peak against the mark , helping German exporters . 
Paris also broke into uncharted territory , led by a boom in financial shares . 
London was the star in Europe &apos;s latest bull run thanks to the pound . 
the FTSE index surged to 4,264.1 points , more than one percent above the previous trading best set on Wednesday . 
sterling took a pounding overnight in Asia as a big sell-off dragged it sharply lower from Wednesday &apos;s 52-month record against the mark . 
it recovered to 2.6728 marks by mid-afternoon , still nearly five pfennigs below its 2.7240 high of yesterday . 
the pound &apos;s recent strength was sapped by growing hopes that British interest rates would remain unchanged and this took pressure off overseas-earning and exporting companies . 
&quot; The theme of today has been sterling , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; It &apos;s helped the dollar earners which has pushed the market higher , and some sectors are being squeezed again . 
sectors which had taken the brunt of the damage from sterling &apos;s strength in recent weeks led the market &apos;s charge , with pharmaceuticals , engineering and drinks shares among the day &apos;s best performers . 
sterling &apos;s decline comes after months of sharp gains as the prospect of rising British interest rates sucked speculative cash into the currency . 
but Wednesday &apos;s weaker-than-expected British retail sales data changed currency dealers &apos; minds , suggesting British rates could be on hold until after the election due by May . 
the bullish mood was also encouraged by a positive start in New York where shares bounced back after ending in the minus column on Wednesday , weighed down by tumbling IBM shares . 
French shares , which hit a record close on Wednesday , also perked up after early losses to hit a new trading peak of 2,463.91 on the CAC-40 index , encouraged by Wall Street &apos;s 0.6 percent gain and strength in financial stocks . 
&quot; We see a new wave of buying on the financial stocks , &quot; one trader in Paris said . 
financial stocks climbed strongly after Societe Generale upped its 1996 profit forecast . 
in Frankfurt , German shares fell at the start of bourse trade following the latest German money supply data which came out slightly higher than expected , scotching hopes of a quick interest rate cut . 
but the DAX share index clawed back the losses to close at a record 3,033.46 points . 
Frankfurt has benefited greatly from the stronger dollar because of the large number of exporting firms listed . 
with the main focus of the currency markets on sterling , the dollar was largely unchanged against the mark and made modest gains on the yen by midafternoon but some traders voiced doubts about how long its bull run would last . 
although the currency did not seem to have reached the end of its rally , it was due for a consolidation , traders said . 
sterling &apos;s plunge and the mark &apos;s recovery against other European units could prove to be an opportunity for the dollar to settle down . 
&quot; Sterling &apos;s acting as a millstone around the dollar &apos;s neck right now . 
the battering that sterling / mark got has boosted the mark relative to the dollar , &quot; said David Brown , chief economist at Bear Stearns . 
the dollar surged to 119.45 yen and 1.6397 marks from Wednesday &apos;s late European levels of 118.91 and 1.6393 . 
the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 49.2 points at 4,268.3 . 
in Paris , the CAC-40 share index was 20.53 higher at 2,462.99 . 
gold was fixed at $ 348.00 an ounce in the afternoon , compared to Wednesday &apos;s close of $ 351.15 . 
silver was two cents stronger at $ 4.75 .
