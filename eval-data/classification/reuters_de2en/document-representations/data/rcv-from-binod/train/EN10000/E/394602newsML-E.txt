following are reactions to January consumer price data released by Statistics Canada on Friday . 
economists in a Reuters survey had forecast , on average , the unadjusted CPI to rise 0.25 percent on the month . 
the survey also forecast a 2.2 percent year-over-year rise in the all-items and 0.15 percent month-on-month rise in the core CPI . 
Michael Gregory , economist , Lehman Brothers - &quot; boring ... But on the other hand , this is exactly where the central bank would like to see inflation at this stage . 
Doug Porter , economist , Nesbitt Burns Inc - &quot; There was no major surprise in the number . 
in fact , it was almost bang on expectations -- that &apos;s the overall number . 
&quot; But on the core , I would say there is still some very good news in that seasonally adjusted prices excluding food and energy were flat on the month -- and that &apos;s certainly one of the best performances we have seen in the past year . 
&quot; So I would say the underlying message is that inflation is still no problem in this country and we will probably actually see the year-over-year rate move a little bit lower in the months ahead . 
Randall Powley , senior economist , ScotiaMcLeod Inc -- &quot; I was a little disappointed because I was hoping for a bit more discounting ... There was no clear evidence of it so that was a little bit bearish . 
&quot; But all of the big increases were not related to markets . 
&quot; So I am neutral to slightly bearish on the report , but all-in-all , there were no big surprises .
