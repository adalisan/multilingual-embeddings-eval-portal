two people were killed and three missing after a French navy ship carrying ageing explosives blew up and sank off the Channel port of Cherbourg on Wednesday , the navy said . 
about a dozen other people were injured , four of them seriously , after the explosion aboard the 450-tonne support ship La Fidele which had been carrying old grenades for destruction at sea . 
the blast off Cape Levy was heard up to 30 km ( 19 miles ) away . 
the injured were flown by helicopter to a military hospital after a rescue by three naval patrol boats , two lifeboats and a helicopter . 
&quot; We don &apos;t know what happened , &quot; said Alain Tournyol du Clos , head of the arsenal where the explosives had been stored on land . 
an investigation was under way . 
the navy said there were 16 naval crew and six civilian ordnance experts aboard the 54-m ( 160-ft ) vessel when it exploded at about 10.30 a.m. ( 0830 GMT ) . 
it sank within minutes . 
the vessel had been carrying about 1,400 ageing grenades of a type used against enemy frogmen , or about 600 kg ( 1,300 lbs ) of explosives , for disposal . 
the explosion took place at the stern of the boat where two teams of three experts were dropping the grenades into the sea . 
since November , the navy had safely carried out five previous missions to destroy a stock of 9,450 grenades . 
under the system , a machine primed the grenades before they dropped into the water and exploded .
