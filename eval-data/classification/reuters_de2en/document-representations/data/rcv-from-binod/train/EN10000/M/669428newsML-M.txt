the dollar crept higher in late European trade , testing session highs against the mark and firmer against the yen but still confined to its recent ranges . 
dealers said trade was fairly thin with the market marking time ahead of U.S. trade data Thursday and the weekend G7 meeting . 
the dollar rose above 1.73 marks following news that Belgium wants to sell more of its gold reserves to cut debt . 
although Belgium is already one of the world &apos;s largest official sellers of reserves in recent years , dealers were dismissive more Belgian sales would have a lasting forex impact . 
&quot; The market is very thin at the moment , it doesn &apos;t take much to move it around , &quot; said a U.S. bank dealer . 
&quot; There may be something in Belgium selling more gold but it &apos;s not going to be a major forex influence . 
dollar / mark was trading at 1.7300 / 10 , just shy of its session highs and late Tuesday &apos;s European level of 1.7336 / 46 . 
against the yen , the dollar stood at 113.26 / 31 against 113.27 / 37 late Tuesday . 
market focus was on U.S. April trade figures due on Thursday after Japan &apos;s May trade surplus rose 222.2 percent from a year earlier and up 93 percent with the U.S. 
more evidence of widening in the U.S.-Japan trade gap in tomorrow &apos;s data will fuel talk of trade tension between the two countries but analysts said much of this has already been priced in and few expected any fireworks at the G7 Denver summit . 
&quot; Given the fact dollar / yen is at a happy medium at the moment I suspect the G7 may not say anything about the currency at all this time , &quot; said Roger Francis , senior analyst at IBJ International in London . 
but dealers said dollar / yen risk still remained to the downside as long as the trade balance issue continues to simmer and the prospect of higher Japan rates stays in place . 
expectations of higher U.S. interest rates in the near-term have eased further after Tuesday &apos;s muted U.S. CPI data . 
demand for yen call options has picked up in the past two days and the risk reversal -- the difference in implied volatility of calls relative to puts and often used as a barometer of market sentiment -- shifted to an extreme bias for yen calls , or dollar / yen weakness . 
options traders said yen call demand and the risk reversal skew was likely to remain in place ahead of the G7 summit . 
&quot; The market &apos;s still concerned we could see another move to the downside , maybe even break 110 , &quot; said a U.S. bank dealer . 
elsewhere , the mark was weaker on its European crosses , pressured by the firmer dollar / mark and also by the ongoing optimism of a broad-based , timely start to Europe &apos;s monetary union . 
Spanish and Italian ten-year yield spreads over Germany touched new lows in afternoon trade , fuelled by optimism of a broad-based EMU . 
the weaker mark also pushed sterling higher in late trade , erasing earlier losses seen today despite a bigger-than-expected rise in UK retail sales .
