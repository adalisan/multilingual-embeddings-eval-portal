the parallel shift in the U.S. Treasury yield curve on Friday indicates that the January employment report did little to alter the view that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates alone , players said . 
both long and short term Treasury yields fell on Friday , with the 30-year dipping to about 6.71 percent and the two-year note declining to 5.86 percent -- a decrease of five basis points for both issues from late Thursday . 
as such , the spread between the issues stayed around 85 basis points , its level of the past couple of weeks . 
&quot; Fed assumptions have not been changed , just delayed for another meeting , &quot; said Patrick Dimick , Treasury market strategist at UBS Securities LLC . 
&quot; The market will be concerned &quot; about tightening at the May Fed meeting , Dimick said , &quot; but fears of a March tightening was allieviated by today &apos;s number . 
the Fed &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) left rates unchanged when it met on Tuesday and Wednesday . 
its next meeting is on March 25 . 
the market had braced for a strong jobs report , particularly on wages , which typically show big gains in the first month of a quarter . 
but average hourly earnings rose just one cent in January after jumping six cents in December . 
that along with a decline in the average workweek offset a rather robust 271,000 gain in nonfarm payrolls last month , which follows a 261,000 rise in December and an upwardly revised 181,000 ( from 127,000 ) in November . 
&quot; Today was just a number that was friendly to the market , &quot; said Neil DeSarno , head trader at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Corp. &quot; The numbers were the same as we have been getting , &quot; he said , noting that recent data have shown moderate growth with few signs of inflation . 
&quot; The numbers don &apos;t change the view whether the Fed will be raising rates pretty soon , &quot; he added . 
&quot; The market got relief that employment wasn &apos;t so bad , but there was no technical shifting and no duration extending . 
players noted that much of the buying on Friday was concentrated in intermediates -- mostly in five- and 10-year notes , given their high levels of liquidity . 
spreads between 10s and fives and fives and twos flattened slightly on Friday . 
to have a significant shift in the yield curve , retail accounts have to change their Fed views , but there was no retail buying on Friday after the jobs data , DeSarno said . 
&quot; The numbers were just ( weak ) enough for the Fed to do nothing at the March meeting ; that &apos;s different from outright weak , &quot; said Dimick . 
&quot; That is why we had a parallel shift . 
you have to remain on the inflation vigil . 
once we discard the vigil , tne you will see steepening , led by the front end .
