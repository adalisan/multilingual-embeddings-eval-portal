the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR said on Thursday some 21,000 Burmese Moslems who fear forced repatriation from Bangladesh were refusing rations in a bid to win a formal pledge they would be allowed to stay . 
spokeswoman Pam O &apos;Toole , citing reports from UNHCR representatives in the area , said the situation in two camps housing the refugees remained tense despite suspension of an operation to send 200 back to Burma during the day . 
&quot; The refugees have put up notice boards saying they want the people sent back this week to be returned and declaring they will not go back to Burma until the military are no longer in power , &quot; she told Reuters . 
o &apos;Toole said the 8,000 Moslems , known as Rohingyas , in Kutupalong camp had now joined 13,000 more in Nayapara camp in refusing rations . 
&quot; They are also refusing to send their children to feeding centres , &quot; she added . 
in Kutupalong , the refugees were involved in a new face-off with riot police . 
&quot; They say they want written confirmation from the Bangladesh authorities that there will be no more forced expulsions , &quot; O &apos;Toole said . 
in two operations earlier in the week a total of 399 of the Rohingyas , the last of nearly 250,000 who fled Burma in the early 1990s , were rounded up and sent back across the border . 
the action sparked rioting in the camps in south-eastern Bangladesh and a protest on Wednesday from UNHCR Acting High Commissioner Sergio Vieira de Mello to the country &apos;s Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad . 
but after signs of a new deportation being planned for Thursday had brought new tension in the camps , officials there made loudspeaker announcements on Wednesday that repatriation operations were being suspended , according to the UNHCR . 
in the nearby city of Cox &apos;s Bazar , a repatriation official said earlier on Thursday that a plan to send back some 200 Rohingyas from Kutupalong during the day had been called off to avoid inflaming violence in the camps . 
&quot; We don &apos;t want to force anyone to go back , &quot; he told Reuters . 
other officials said the repatriation was aborted after refugees had put on red headbands , brandished sticks and knives and chanted demands to be allowed to stay in Bangladesh . 
&quot; We must resist bids to push us across the ( Naf ) river into death traps in Burma , &quot; one official quoted a protester at Kutupalong as saying . 
many of the refugees insist they were escaping political repression when the mass exodus from Burma &apos;s Moslem-dominated Aran province began in 1992 . 
the UNHCR says recent arrivals speak of being forced from their land into slave labour . 
but the Bangladesh authorities , faced with an unwanted burden on their already precarious economy , say most of the Rohingyas moved into the country in search of better living conditions rather than for political reasons . 
most of the original refugees have gone back under programmes supervised by the UNHCR , whose spokeswoman said on Thursday there had been no reply so far to de Mello &apos;s protest . 
Bangladesh foreign ministry officials in the capital Dhaka said on Wednesday the resistance by the remaining 21,000 against repatriation only began when news leaked that the U.N. agency was asking the government to let them stay . 
the UNHCR argues that forcing refugees anywhere in the world to return home against their will runs against international humanitarian law . 
it says its staff were not allowed to check whether the Rohingya refugees in this week &apos;s roundups were willing to return and that families were separated in the two operations .
