finance Minister Trevor Manuel said in a statement on Monday he was delighted with the U.S. response to South Africa &apos;s first Yankee bond issue . 
&quot; We were very pleased with the investor response to the issue , which was such that the demand at the launch on Friday exceeded the availability , resulting in a positive pricing of 195 basis points over the 10-year U.S. Treasury , &quot; he said . 
the $ 300 million bond , with a 8.375 percent coupon , was issued after a South African tour to nine cities including New York , Los Angeles , San Francisco and Denver .
