forget the tax-cut debate , the fund-raising scandal and the posturing over whether to torpedo government spending on the arts . 
the deepest divide in Washington is the Anacostia River . 
the river , which runs into the much more famous Potomac on its way to Chesapeake Bay , divides Washington into the capital of the only remaining world superpower on one side and what is sometimes called the murder capital of the world on the other . 
across the river from the Washington of broad boulevards and monuments is Southeast Washington , a place some of its residents call a Third World country where a vicious cycle of poverty , drugs and violence belies the image of America as a shining city on a hill . 
in the city where Martin Luther King Jr. once spoke of his dream of one nation no longer divided by race , the District of Columbia &apos;s two extremes are sadly separated . 
&quot; You &apos;ve got a black city and a white city , &quot; African American building contractor and community activist Cardell Shelton told Reuters . 
&quot; When you look at every black community in this city it &apos;s a crime haven , decrepit , abused , misused and neglected . 
there &apos;s no economic development , no investment . 
two-thirds of Washington residents are African American , a demographic trend with origins in the days of slavery , when the city was a magnet for blacks escaping the plantations of the South . 
Washington remains largely segregated today . 
&quot; People were brought over here in chains 375 years ago and slavery got married to racial bigotry . 
it goes back all the way to then , &quot; Professor Leonard Steinhorn of Washington &apos;s American University , an author of books on race issues , said . 
downtown Washington is sometimes referred to by tourists as the Paris of North America because of its stunning architecture and majestic monuments . 
even the ethnic Adams Morgan district , home to immigrants from all over the world , thrives with nightlife , rivaling the historic Georgetown area as the trendiest in the city . 
but the Southeast quadrant of Washington is where you go for a mugging at night , not a double latte . 
at first glance , Southeast does not appear so bad . 
its brick homes , many of them government-built projects , do not have the same kind of graffiti , piles of trash and broken windows of many inner-city slums . 
but Southeast residents routinely tick off a long list of problems with complex causes and evasive solutions . 
&quot; You &apos;re talking about a Third World nation , &quot; Nathan Price , a taxi driver who is leading a movement to remove Mayor Marion Barry from office , told Reuters . 
&quot; Something is wrong . 
Washington , a 68-square-mile ( 176 sq km ) city of less than 600,000 people , had 397 murders last year , which ranks sixth in the United States behind megacities New York ( 986 ) , Chicago ( 789 ) , Los Angeles ( 709 ) , Detroit ( 428 ) and Philadelphia ( 414 ) , according to FBI crime statistics . 
that was why it came as such a shock to Washingtonians when Barry told CNN recently that Washington was safer than Topeka , Kansas ( population 120,000 ) , which had 17 murders in 1996 . 
Barry later attempted to clarify his comments , saying he was referring to the downtown and tourist areas of Washington , serving only to confirm Washington as a city of two faces . 
he spoke before three young people were found murdered with multiple gunshot wounds to the head on July 7 in a grisly scene at a Starbucks coffee shop in fashionable Georgetown . 
Barry blames the district &apos;s unique status -- it has some of the attributes of a city and some of a state but is not really one or the other . 
&quot; It does not work , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The best manager in America , in the world , couldn &apos;t manage this government the way it &apos;s structured . 
even out-of-towners know about the two Washingtons . 
tourist Bill Wallpe , a bank manager from Danville , Illinois , said he had been warned about it by a friend back home who is a former Washington police detective . 
&quot; When we were driving into town yesterday we came through some of these areas and got kind of lost , &quot; Wallpe told Reuters outside the White House . 
&quot; We got into some less than desirable parts of town . 
it was a little bit scary .
