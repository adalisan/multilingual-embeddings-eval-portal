it is already virtually certain that one of soccer &apos;s quirkiest records will still be intact in a year &apos;s time when Barcelona surely fail to retain the European Cup Winners Cup . 
not that the outcome of next year &apos;s final has been pre-determined by some higher soccer authority . 
although , some might argue , that that is exactly what has happened . 
the point is that Barcelona will almost certainly be in the expanded European Champions Cup next season although they are unlikely to be the champions of Spain . 
they will enter the tournament most likely as runners-up to Real Madrid , who look set to take the title . 
the bizarre situation will arise that the Cup Winners Cup holders will not defend the trophy they have won , but will instead attempt to win a title that , until a controversial rule change , they would not have been allowed to enter . 
so unless Barcelona have a monumental loss of form over the last few weeks of the season and finish lower than second , they will enter the European Cup and not retain the title they took in some style on Wednesday night with a 1-0 win over holders Paris St Germain . 
no team has ever won the Cup Winners Cup in successive seasons and PSG became the eighth team to lose in the final a year after winning it , following in the footsteps of fiorentina , Atletico Madrid , AC Milan , Anderlecht , Ajax , Parma , and Arsenal . 
right now it looks unlikely that Barcelona will win that cup against next year , and within minutes of his team &apos;s victory on Wednesday , Barcelona &apos;s coach Bobby Robson was already talking about the European Cup . 
he might not be at the Camp Nou to lead them to glory in it because it is widely rumoured that Ajax &apos;s outgoing Lous Van Gaal will succeed him next season . 
but now , more than ever before , the European Cup is the competition to win . 
the Cup Winners is a nice prize , but it is very much a consolation for Europe &apos;s biggest clubs .
