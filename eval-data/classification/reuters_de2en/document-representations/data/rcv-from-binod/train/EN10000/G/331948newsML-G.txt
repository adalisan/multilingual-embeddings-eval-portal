a German court on Friday sentenced tennis star Steffi Graf &apos;s father Peter to three years and nine months in jail for evading tax on her earnings , but said investigations against the player should be dropped . 
Graf , 58 , was convicted on six counts of actual and attempted tax evasion amounting to 12 million marks ( $ 7.4 million ) on Steffi &apos;s income , while former family tax adviser Joachim Eckardt received two and a half years for complicity . 
tax investigators had also targeted the world number one player , whose signature was on all the tax returns . 
but presiding judge Joachim Plass said that probe should be dropped . 
&quot; After we read all the evidence and listened to all the witnesses , we decided that no active participation by Steffi Graf can be seen , &quot; he told the court in his judgment . 
Plass said he had rejected the defence &apos;s idea of replacing part of the jail term with a fine &quot; because Mr Graf &apos;s money is Stefanie Graf &apos;s money and a fine would hurt her financially &quot; . 
he portrayed Peter Graf as a vulnerable man who channelled his huge ambition into managing his daughter &apos;s career . 
&quot; Graf did not want to delegate ... he wanted to keep things in his own hands , &quot; Plass said . 
&quot; He wanted to be better than renowned experts . 
he also focused on Graf &apos;s chequered personal history including the suicide of his mother when he was a teenager , blackmail attempts against him , a breakdown and heavy drinking . 
the sentence was stiffer than the suspended term sought by Graf &apos;s lawyers , but fell short of prosecutors &apos; demands . 
Graf &apos;s lawyers said he had not yet decided whether to appeal . 
&quot; One of the most important things for us and for the Graf family is that the court wants prosecutors to close the files in the case of Stefanie Graf , &quot; said Graf &apos;s attorney Franz Salditt , who also thanked the court for a fair trial . 
Plass said he had not imposed a longer term partly because tax authorities had been lax in monitoring the case . 
he also decided that the evasion amounted to less than the 19.2 million marks ( $ 11.7 million ) which the prosecution said Graf concealed . 
the seven-times Wimbledon champion , who suffered a surprise fourth round defeat in the Australian Open last week , left Melbourne for Japan shortly after her father was convicted . 
&quot; Haven &apos;t you guys got enough ? 
&quot; she retorted as reporters shouted questions at her . 
her father , dressed in a dark suit , left the courtroom surrounded by bodyguards and slipped out of the building by a back entrance without speaking to reporters . 
it was not immediately clear how long he would have to spend in jail as he had already spent 15 months in investigative custody during the probe and the trial . 
prisoners in Germany are normally eligible for release after serving around two-thirds of their sentence -- 30 months in Graf &apos;s case . 
after authorities subtract the time he has already spent behind bars , he could be in jail for around 15 months . 
one member of his legal team said he was optimistic an appeal could be lodged to have Graf serve only half of the remaining 15 months , with the rest suspended . 
initially , Graf and Eckardt remain free until the verdict becomes legally binding , which normally happens after one week . 
but prosecutors said they would lodge an appeal within that time to give themselves a chance to contest the sentence after further examination . 
a court spokesman said it would then take several months for an appeal to be processed and passed on to a higher court , which could then take several more months to issue its verdict . 
during that time Peter Graf would remain free .
