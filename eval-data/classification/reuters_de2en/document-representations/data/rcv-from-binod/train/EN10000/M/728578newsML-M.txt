an issue of 598.54 billion lei of three-month treasury bills was heavily oversubscribed on Tuesday , when 21 bidders entered a total 2.05 trillion lei for the finance ministry offer . 
the T-bills bear an annual yield of 42 percent , a central bank ( BNR ) statement showed on Tuesday . 
the previous yield was higher at 55 percent . 
the bids ranged from 38 to 75 percent . 
some 463.4 billion lei went to commercial banks operating in Romania , including branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks , while 135.14 billion went to their corporate clients . 
traders from the money market said they expected short-term rates to fall on Wednesday below 50 percent , after the declines in Tuesday &apos;s T-bills yields . 
they said the T-bills issue was unlikely to drain the leu funds in excess . 
operators said the local money market was overliquid in leu funds due mainly to BNR dollar purchases . 
they said the dollar funds in excess on the foreign exchange market came from growing foreign interest in Romanian equities .
