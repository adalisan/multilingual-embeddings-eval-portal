the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that it expected to reactivate , and possibly expand , a stalled standby loan to Pakistan next month and to start early discussions on a longer-term structural adjustment loan . 
a statement from the IMF &apos;s resident mission in Islamabad said the IMF and Pakistan &apos;s caretaker government had confirmed a draft agreement on resuming loan disbursements that was originally reached with the ousted government of Benazir Bhutto . 
the IMF statement said Pakistani authorities have also asked for more money under the standby arrangement and that the request would be considered . 
the original loan was for $ 600 million . 
an IMF team led by Paul Chabrier , director of its Middle Eastern department , conducted the discussions with Pakistani officials . 
&quot; These were extremely successful discussions , &quot; Shahid Javed Burki , adviser on finance and economic affairs to caretaker Prime Minister Meraj Khalid , said in a news conference . 
&quot; With the conclusion of this agreement we have really turned the corner , &quot; said Burki , who is on leave from the World Bank . 
the IMF had withheld two $ 80 million disbursements of the standby loan due in June and September because it was unhappy with the Bhutto government &apos;s economic performance and the budget for fiscal 1996 / 97 ( July-June ) . 
the IMF relented last month after Bhutto unveiled a new economic stabilisation package . 
but following Bhutto &apos;s dismissal on November 5 and replacement by the interim government , the IMF had asked for assurances that her economic package would be carried out by any permanent future government . 
Burki said he expected the IMF to make an extra up-front payment on top of the overdue $ 160 million . 
he gave no figures . 
Burki also said he would go to Washington in early December to start talks with the IMF on a new , longer term , enhanced structural adjustment facility ( ESAF ) agreement , which he hoped could be reached before the end of fiscal 1996 / 97 . 
&quot; Structural reform measures being implemented by the government will facilitate initiation of discussions on an ESAF arrangement at an early date , &quot; the IMF statement said . 
Pakistan needs funds now to replenish its depleted foreign reserves and make payments due next month on its foreign debt , which stood at $ 28.6 billion at the end of June . 
Burki said he and Chabrier had briefed President Farooq Leghari on the accord reached with the caretaker government , which has a 90-day mandate to oversee elections on February 3 . 
Leghari , who sacked Bhutto &apos;s government for alleged misrule and corruption on November 5 , told Chabrier he would take &quot; personal responsibility &quot; to ensure that economic reforms begun now would be implemented by whatever government is elected in February . 
Burki quoted Leghari as saying that a lesson had been learnt from the experience of the last caretaker government led by Moeen Qureshi , which set Pakistan on an IMF-agreed reform course in 1993 , only to see the Bhutto government deviate from it . 
&quot; I &apos;m keen that we should proceed on two tracks -- stabilisation and structural reforms , &quot; Burki said . 
Burki said the IMF wanted the budget deficit cut to 4.0 percent of gross domestic product this fiscal year from 6.3 percent in 1995 / 96 , but did not say what other targets had been set . 
he also said he planned to meet with representatives of U.S. credit rating agencies while in the United States . 
Moody &apos;s Investors Services Inc cut Pakistan &apos;s credit ratings on November 6 due to the nation &apos;s economic woes .
