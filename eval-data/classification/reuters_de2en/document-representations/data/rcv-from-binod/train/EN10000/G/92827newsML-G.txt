the new Dominican president , who grew up in New York and attended the city &apos;s public schools , said recent U.S. legislation to tighten immigration could have a serious impact on his country . 
Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez said U.S. laws making immigration more difficult would hurt the Dominican Republic &apos;s economy and could spark illegal immigration to the United States . 
&quot; One of the major pillars of the Dominican economy is the remittances of Dominicans &apos; living abroad , especially in the New York area , &quot; Fernandez said . 
the U.S. Congress approved legislation this week to overhaul immigration law . 
&quot; We need to make the Congress more aware of the impact this legislation has on countries like the Dominican Republic , &quot; Fernandez said . 
if fewer Dominicans are able to send money home and economic conditions worsen in the Republic , many Dominicans could have no other possibility than trying to enter the United States illegally .
