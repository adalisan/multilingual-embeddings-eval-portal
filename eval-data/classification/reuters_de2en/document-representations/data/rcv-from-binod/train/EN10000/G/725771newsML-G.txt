Cambodia &apos;s Second Prime Minister Hun Sen on Monday accused unidentified Taiwanese , including a general , of involvement in this month &apos;s fighting in Phnom Penh , prompting sharp denials from Taipei . 
the day there was fighting happening , the Taiwanese were there , &quot; he said in a speech to villagers in Kompong Thom province north of the capital . 
Hun Sen was referring to fighting in Phnom Penh on July 5 and 6 when he ousted First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh . 
&quot; Frankly speaking there was a two-star general there . 
now he is hiding in Phnom Penh . 
we have evidence these Taiwanese gave money to buy weapons , &quot; he said . 
Hun Sen said Cambodia could cooperate with Thailand and Vietnam to arrest the Taiwanese people . 
he did not elaborate . 
Taiwan &apos;s foreign ministry on Monday denied any government involvement . 
&quot; The government will not involve itself in the internal politics of any foreign country , &quot; Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokesman Roy Wu told reporters in Taipei . 
Taiwan &apos;s defence ministry denied the presence of the two-star general . 
&quot; There was absolutely no such thing , &quot; it said . 
an official at Taiwan &apos;s trade office in Phnom Penh , which represents the Taiwan government in Cambodia , said he was not aware that any Taiwan people were involved in Cambodia &apos;s political crisis . 
&quot; We have never heard of that . 
we don &apos;t do things like that , &quot; said the official who declined to be identified . 
Cambodia follows a one-China policy , recognising Beijing and not Taiwan , although Taiwan is Cambodia &apos;s largest foreign investor . 
China has considered Taiwan a rebel province since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 .
