the brutal years of Hitler &apos;s Third Reich followed by 40 years of East German commmunism could not force Erwin Guenzel to leave the village of Altreetz . 
now , faced with what could yet be the worst flooding in over 200 years , Guenzel and his neighbours are again refusing to leave , preferring to fill sandbags rather than pack their bags and head for higher ground . 
&quot; I saw what the Nazis did to my home and my family , even as a small boy during that time and I had my problems with the communists too , &quot; the 66-year-old Guenzel said as he heaved a sandbag onto a wooden pallet . 
&quot; When you &apos;ve lived through all that , you &apos;re not about to give up everything you &apos;ve built because of a flood . 
Guenzel &apos;s feelings are shared by almost everyone in this village with 300 residents , where most have said they will still stay in harm &apos;s way should the dike along the Oder river burst . 
in the village square , dozens of locals sat beneath a canopy of ancient oak trees , drinking refreshments and resting from days of sandbagging . 
many people left their homes 10 days ago when the local authorities began evacuating the region only to return within days , ignoring police orders to stay away , in order to do their best to save their homes from the impending flood . 
to the east of Altreetz lies the main line of dikes on the Oder river that is part of Germany &apos;s border with Poland . 
to the south and west soldiers have been building a line of secondary dikes , to protect outlying towns should the main dike break . 
now the villagers fear soldiers could allow Altreetz to be engulfed by the water in order to save the larger towns of Bad Freienwalde and Wrietzen . 
refusing to give up hope that the main dike can still be saved , the entire village from small children to housewives and grandparents is pitching in , filling sandbags and keeping the pressure up on authorities not to abandon the main dike . 
even Chancellor Helmut Kohl , who visited the village last week , became the target of village concerns as he was surrounded by dozens of local residents who demanded that he pledge not to give up a single inch of the main dike . 
the town itself has become a crack volunteer corps , led by the volunteer fire department and a team of local mothers . 
villagers begin work each day at 7 a.m , filling sandbags or cooking soup and sausages until the sun sets over the staple crop of sunflowers at about 9 : 30 in the evening . 
&quot; Look around , &quot; said Guenzel , &quot; people are still living their lives here , getting by , helping each other . 
but here it &apos;s filled with volunteers and not just the boys from the army . 
asked how long a shift he planned on putting in for the day , Guenzel waved away one of the incessant flies that have decended on the region since the floods , squinted up at the midday sun and shrugged his shoulders . 
&quot; You know , I &apos;m retired and can &apos;t really make it as long as the younger ones , &quot; he said .
