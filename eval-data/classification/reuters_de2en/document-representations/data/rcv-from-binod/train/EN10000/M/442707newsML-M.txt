traders of U.S. government securities return to a tense environment Monday to face a week of debate on whether the U.S. central bank would move to tighten monetary policy at its next meeting . 
yields on the 30-year Treasury bond skirted crossing the 7.0 percent barrier on the back of strong retail sales revisions on Thursday and may breach that mark next week . 
the data scheduled for release during the week will be the last before the Federal Reserve &apos;s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meets on March 25 . 
no data was set for release Monday , but Tuesday will see housing starts . 
many analysts were calling for a strong number . 
&quot; We estimate housing starts continued their rebound from the exceedingly sharp and unsustainable 11.0 percent decline in December with a 7.4 percent increase in February . 
such a gain would leave the February level some 2.4 percent lower than the November level and slightly below the average for all of 1996 , &quot; said Donald Maude , chief U.S. fixed-income strategist with Scotia Capital Markets ( U.S.A. ) Inc . 
bad weather in the West helped lower the December reading . 
February consumer prices were set for release on Wednesday along with real earnings . 
most players expected a tame CPI reading , especially in light of the weak producer price data already seen . 
also on Wednesday Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan speaks on financial services modernization before the House . 
international trade was scheduled for release on Thursday along with the Philadelphia Fed &apos;s March index . 
&quot; CPI will be a nonevent and the Philly Fed no big deal . 
and my guess is Greenspan studiously avoids saying anything that tips the hand of the FOMC , &quot; said Raymond Worseck , chief economist with AG Edwards &amp; sons Inc . 
Worseck expected the bond market could be prone to weakness during the week as the era of goodwill between the parties on achieving a balanced budget seemed to be unraveling and Clinton backed away from reform on measuring CPI . 
he also said industrial commodities could begin to show more strength , driving up fears of inflationary pressures in the pipeline . 
Worseck said the Fed wasn &apos;t likely to tighten at its March 25 meeting . 
&quot; The closer we get to the FOMC and with people feeling there may be no raising of rates , the more pressure the U.S. dollar will come under , &quot; said Worseck . 
&quot; The March Philly Fed could be interesting . 
it &apos;s important because it &apos;s a March number and does get some audience at the FOMC meeting , said Hugh Johnson , chief economist at First Albany Corp. &quot; That and CPI are the only potential market movers next week . 
as debate on what action the FOMC may or may not take intensifies , the bond market could be subject to some slippage , but a substantial movement was unlikely , Johnson said . 
consequently , he predicted yields on the 30-year bond would be at 6.95 percent by Friday -- virtually the same as the level they were at a week prior . 
late Friday afternoon three-month bill rates were unchanged at 5.10 percent . 
six-month bill rates were up one basis point at 5.21 percent . 
year bill rates were down one basis point at 5.41 percent . 
two-year notes were unchanged at 99-15 / 32 , yielding 6.17 percent . 
five-year notes were up 1 / 32 at 98-27 / 32 , yielding 6.53 percent . 
ten-year notes were unchanged at 96-24 / 32 , yielding 6.70 percent . 
the 30-year bond was trading up 4 / 32 at 95-30 / 32 to yield 6.95 percent .
