figures exclude precious metals and stones , art and antiques . 
including those items , the February trade balance showed a surplus of 31.5 million on exports of 8,602.6 million and imports of 8,571.1 million . 
&quot; In the wake of the weakening of the Swiss franc , prices for imported and exported goods were tangibly above the year-earlier level , even if the mean index overstated export price developments , &quot; it said . 
&quot; Terms of trade thus improved in favour of Switzerland . 
adjusted for the number of working days , exports grew a nominal 10.8 percent and a real 4.6 percent from February 1996 . 
imports rose a nominal 14.6 percent and a real 10.2 percent .
