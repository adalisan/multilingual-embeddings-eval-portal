France &apos;s Roman Catholic Church added its moral weight on Tuesday to a chorus of condemnation of far-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen for espousing racial inequality , saying it was unacceptable to Christians . 
&quot; When a public figure dares to assert the inequality of races as the truth , there is a danger for the whole of society . 
this assertion undermines the foundations of solidarity which is so necessary in these times of crisis , &quot; the Catholic Bishops &apos; Conference said in a statement . 
&quot; It fuels racist behaviour , hatred of others and exclusion . 
it is an attack on the national identity which is based on values accepted by all : liberty , equality and fraternity , &quot; it said . 
&quot; For a Christian , such statements are unacceptable . 
an unrepentant Le Pen stuck to his guns on Tuesday , saying people were equal in law even if they were of unequal ability . 
while saying France &apos;s civilisation is superior , he has carefully avoided saying some races are inferior . 
&quot; All men individually have the same rights and dignity , but they are unequal in their ability to understand Greek , or run the 100 metres or swim a kilometre . 
that &apos;s self-evident , &quot; the anti-immigration campaigner told Radio Monte Carlo . 
the hard-right leader said he hoped to attend Pope John Paul &apos;s mass in Reims next Sunday celebrating the 1,500th anniversary of the baptism of king Clovis , although the Church said on Monday he had not been invited and would not be admitted to the VIP enclosure . 
Le Pen said on Sunday he had been invited as a member of the European Parliament and planned to go to Reims .
