ousted Burundian President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya ended a year of &quot; exile &quot; on Saturday with a call for a negotiated settlement involving all parties to the conflict in his tiny and volatile central African state . 
Ntibantunganya left the U.S. embassy in Bujumbura on Saturday after taking refuge there almost a year ago . 
earlier , he held talks with the man who replaced him , moderate Tutsi President Pierre Buyoya , in the presence of Catholic bishops . 
he said he would not contest Buyoya &apos;s claim to the presidency . 
&quot; I reaffirm that I shall not yield on the principle for a search for a negotiated solution for all problems that face our country . 
this approach must be guarded by tolerance , mutual respect and a strong resolve to save a nation more than ever confronted by numerous uncertainties , &quot; he told a news conference at his new residence . 
Ntibantunganya , 41 , was Burundi &apos;s third civilian president at the time he was toppled . 
Burundi &apos;s first fairly elected head of state , Melchior Ndadaye , was killed in 1993 by hardliners in the army , which is 95 percent composed of the Tutsi minority . 
Ndadaye &apos;s killing sparked a frenzy of revenge massacres by his Hutu tribe , a vast majority in a six million population but excluded from power since independence from Belgium in 1962 . 
Ndadaye &apos;s successor , Cyprien Ntaryamira , was killed in April 1994 with Rwandan president Juvenal Habyarimana . 
Ntibantunganya said he wanted the talks to end Burundi &apos;s crisis to protect against &quot; selfishness , arrogance and contempt by parties that wanted to impose their views on Burundi &quot; . 
Ntibantunganya would not say whether he had been asked to help in negotiations with the main ethnic Hutu CNDD party , which began direct talks with Buyoya &apos;s government last month . 
Ntibantunganya said he would tell Burundians and regional leaders in the coming days how he planned to help rebuild the country &quot; after examining how the country is governed &quot; . 
&quot; I will tell them how I plan to work to rekindle their hope for peace , how we will emerge from the very serious challenge of history in which our nation finds itself , &quot; he said . 
Buyoya announced this month his government had signed a pre-ceasefire agreement with the rebel Hutu National Council for the Defence of Democracy ( CNDD ) , after direct talks in Rome .
