Middle East tanker rates were steady on Tuesday , while brokers saw scope for sharply higher levels in the Mediterranean . 
&quot; The Mediterranean is going to improve , &quot; an Italian broker said . 
&quot; Yesterday a lot of deals were done on a private basis . 
he said that for 80,000 tonne vessels bids were heard at W155-160 , dramatically up from about W100 , but added : &quot; It &apos;s a try , a starting offer . 
we will have to see how it develops . 
&quot; There are very few ships for early February , not more than one or two , &quot; the broker said . 
but 130,000 tonne Med cargoes were flat at W85-87.5. 
brokers said Middle East rates were little changed on most routes , with very large crude carriers ( VLCCs ) to Japan steady at W65 , to U.K. / CONT at W55 and to Singapore at W57.5. 
in the West African sector , 130,000-tonne vessels to the U.S. Gulf were slightly firmer at W95 from W92.5 , with VLCCs little changed at W62.5. 
&quot; There &apos;s a shortage of quality vessels , &quot; one broker said . 
bids for 80,000 tonne transatlantic trips were up sharply , with W176.5 reported . 
but one broker said , &quot; It doesn &apos;t mean it will get done at that kind of rate . 
we will see how it pans out . 
transatlantic VLCCs and 130,000 tonne vessels were little changed , at about W62.5 and W95 respectively . 
Inter-U.K. / CONT rates were likewise steady at W110-120 . 
it &apos;s tightest for the end of the month . 
it begins to come off again in February , &quot; one broker said . 
fuel oil was steady , with 25,000 tonnes inter-U.K. / CONT at W195 and W190 for cross-Med . 
&quot; There hasn &apos;t been a terrific amount of enquiry but just enough to keep rates up , &quot; one broker said .
