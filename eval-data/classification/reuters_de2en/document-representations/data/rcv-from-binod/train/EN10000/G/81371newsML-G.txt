the secretary-general of the Inter-Parliamentary Union , on a visit to Indonesia , said on Friday he would examine alleged human rights abuses against local parliamentarians . 
IPU Secretary-General Pierre Cornillon told reporters after meeting the National Commission on Human Rights that he was gathering information on former Indonesian legislators Sukatno and Sri Bintang Pamungkas . 
Sukatno , a former Communist , has been on death row for almost 30 years after a failed coup in 1965 . 
Pamungkas , ousted by his United Development Party for being too outspoken , has been convicted of insulting the president and sentenced to a jail term . 
he remains free pending an appeal . 
Cornillon , who arrived in Indonesia on Thursday , refused to say whether he would examine the case of ousted minority party leader Megawati Sukarnoputri , or cases of legislators loyal to her who have been questioned by authorities in wake of the July 27 riots . 
but in a letter to the speaker of the Indonesian parliament , Cornillon said that his visit was aimed at examining issues raised by the IPU human rights committee , including Megawati &apos;s case . 
Megawati , ousted by government-backed party rebels in June , remains a member of parliament . 
she has been questioned three times by authorities since the July 27 riots , the worst violence to strike the capital in 20 years .
