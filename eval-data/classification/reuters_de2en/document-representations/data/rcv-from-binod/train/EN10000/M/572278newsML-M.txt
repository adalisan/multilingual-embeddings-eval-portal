Asian stock markets headed in different directions on Friday , with Hong Kong and Sydney drawing strength from Wall Street and hitting record highs while Tokyo dropped on the dollar &apos;s fall . 
Taipei and Bangkok , meanwhile , fell on local political and financial concerns . 
the dollar slid to below 123 yen in Asian morning trade , its lowest level in more than a month . 
the decline was ignited by widespread concern that central banks would sell the dollar to halt its two-year rally . 
in Tokyo , the dollar &apos;s fall prompted traders to take quick profits in export-oriented shares ahead of the weekend . 
the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 leading shares fell 259.03 points or 1.29 percent to close at 19,802.78 . 
&quot; currencies provided a cue for investors who had been buying blue chips lately to start correcting , &quot; said Noboru Yorita , general manager at Tachibana Securities in Tokyo . 
&quot; How fast buying resumes , or when it does , will depend on the yen . 
on Thursday , the Dow Jones industrial average rose 50.97 points to 7,136.62 , lifted after a drop in long-term interest rates that helped investors put a positive spin on the impact of a proposed capital gains tax cut . 
the Dow &apos;s recovery boosted sentiment in Hong Kong and Australia , where the stock markets rose to record high levels . 
Hong Kong stocks thundered to a record close , with the turnover swelling to the heaviest in the exchange &apos;s history . 
the index gained 190.5 points or 1.39 percent to end at a record closing high of 13,930.80 , surpassing the previous record of 13,868.24 set on January 20 . 
&quot; The record highs on Wall Street have given us the room to move ahead today , &quot; said Francis Wong , executive director at DBS Securities in Hong Kong . 
&quot; But the bulk of the short-term movement is due to derivative and hedge fund players . 
active buying in HSBC Holdings and Hong Kong Telecommunications were behind the index &apos;s earlier leap to an all-time high of 14,047.20 . 
but it later retreated after CITIC Pacific announced that it had agreed to sell its stake in Hongkong Telecom to China Everbright Holdings Co Ltd , one of the largest conglomerates in China . 
CITIC Pacific and Hongkong Telecom , both of which were suspended in the morning , resumed trading in the afternoon and were partly responsible for the index &apos;s record leap . 
in Australia , the key All Ordinaries index rose to a new record close of of 2,526.0 , up 21.3 points from Thursday , surpassing a previous record close of 2,517.6 set on Wednesday . 
but it was off the intraday record high of 2,528.1 . 
in Taipei , shares slumped on jitters over political instability after the resignations of three cabinet members ahead of a planned cabinet reshuffle . 
the weighted index ended down 116.48 points or 1.39 percent at 8,233.37 . 
Minister without portfolio Ma Ying-jeou , Interior Minister Lin Feng-cheng and Council of Agriculture chairman Tjiu Mau-ying tendered their resignations on Thursday amid a public outcry over the government &apos;s failure to maintain social order . 
Ben Lee , head of research at Nomura Securities in Taipei , said instability would continue until the completion of the planned reshuffle . 
but he saw no sharp falls ahead . 
&quot; Many expect the government to likely issue certain bullish news to help support the market , so a consolidation is more likely before the political uncertainty is over , &quot; Lee said . 
in Thailand , stocks took a further drubbing in the morning , as concerns over the currency and economy prompted foreign investors to unwind positions in bank and finance stocks . 
the benchmark SET index had fallen 12.57 points , or 2.05 percent , to 601.49 by the break after briefly falling below the 600-point level . 
the Singapore market had firmed by lunchtime , with the Straits Times Industrials Index rising 5.22 to 2,064.60 . 
Jakarta was higher at midday , aided by foreign buying . 
the key composite index was up 5.78 points or 0.87 percent at 672.63 points by the lunch break . 
Seoul ended slightly higher in a technical rebound in response to four straight days of losses . 
the composite index closed up 2.93 points at 687.62 .
