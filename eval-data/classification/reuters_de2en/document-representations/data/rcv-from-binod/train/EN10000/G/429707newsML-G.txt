West Indies , led by an inspired display by Brian Lara , piled on the runs in the final session of the fourth day on Sunday to give themselves an outside chance of victory in the first test against India . 
Lara hit a lightening 78 as the home side raced from 79 for one wicket at tea in their second innings to 241 for four at the close , an overall lead of 322 with one day left to play . 
Lara and Shivnarine Chanderpaul put on 122 runs for the third wicket after Anil Kumble had struck in quick succession to take the wickets of Sherwin Campbell and Stuart Williams and leave the West Indies at 81 for two . 
Lara , who faced 83 balls and hit one six and eight fours , eventually became Kumble &apos;s third victim of the innings while Chanderpaul was caught by Sandul Tendulkar off the bowling of Abey Kuruvilla one ball later with the score stuck on 203 . 
but Roland Holder and Carl Hooper then continued the West Indian onslaught and were not out on 21 and 12 respectively at the close . 
play was prolonged by 65 minutes after two interruptions for light rain during the afternoon . 
India , who had resumed at 308 for seven overnight , were all out for 346 just before lunch . 
Debutant paceman Franklyn Rose , the scourge of the Indian batsman on Saturday when he took five wickets , added Kuruvilla to his list of victims to finish with figures of six for 100 from 33 overs . 
Kuruvilla was out without scoring . 
Nayan Mongia , who rescued the Indians on Saturday , resumed at 74 but added only four before his attempted hook off captain and fast Bowler Courtney Walsh was caught by Roland Holder at square leg . 
Sunil Joshi , with a career-best 43 including three fours off 148 balls , frustrated the West Indian fast bowlers with a last wicket partnership of 26 with Prasad before being bowled by Ian Bishop .
