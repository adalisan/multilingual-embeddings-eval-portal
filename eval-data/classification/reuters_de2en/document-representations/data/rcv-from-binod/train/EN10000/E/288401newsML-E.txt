the lower house of Polish parliament will vote on the 1997 budget draft in two weeks , Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko said on Monday . 
&quot; The budget draft will be voted on in the Sejm in two weeks , &quot; PAP quoted Kolodko as saying . 
the budget draft envisages a deficit of 12.2 billion zlotys or 2.8 percent of gross domestic product , the same percentage gap that had been set for 1996 . 
a deficit of 2.6 percent had been planned for 1997 until last November , when parliament cut taxes . 
this year &apos;s budget sees year-on-year inflation , which was at 19.1 percent in November , falling to 13 percent in December 1997 .
