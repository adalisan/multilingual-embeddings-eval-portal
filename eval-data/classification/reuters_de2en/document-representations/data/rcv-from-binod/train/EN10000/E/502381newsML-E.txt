the International Monetary Fund &apos;s chief negotiator for Romania said on Friday that the country &apos;s 90 percent inflation year-on-year target for 1997 was feasible but ambitious in view of recent price increases . 
Poul Thomson said in an interview that a 30.7 percent increase in prices last month was more than expected but was attributable to price adjustments and liberalisation and did not indicate underlying inflation . 
&quot; That was indeed considerably above what we expected . 
this is nothing that gives rise to alarm . 
it &apos;s not a reflection on underlying inflation , &quot; he said . 
Thomsen said Finance Minister Mircea Ciumara &apos;s insistence on maintaining 90 percent as a target for 1997 in the budget presented to parliament on Thursday was an ambitious goal . 
&quot; ninety percent is an ambitious target for the year as a whole . 
as the price increases are a once and for all matter , We don t realy know what underlying inflation is , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Is 90 percent feasible ? 
yes , but it is an ambitious target now . 
we shall have to see as the programme develops . 
the IMF sees approval of the budget as a key condition for resumption of the Fund &apos;s suspended credits at a Fund Board meeting later this month . 
Thomsen was confident inflation would decline in coming months but declined to speculate on a new figure . 
&quot; It won &apos;t get worse . 
it will get better from here . 
inflation definitely will come down sharply in the last nine months of the year . 
you &apos;re not going to get me to tell you exactly what it will be , but there will be a sharp decline . 
under the centrist government &apos;s tough reform programme , drawn up with IMF assistance , prices of staples and utilities rose sharply in mid-February after being held down by the previous leftist administration ahead of elections last year . 
Thomsen said he believed Romania had a good chance of securing new IMF credits and put at about $ 400 million the estimated amount of funds to be made available in about five tranches .
