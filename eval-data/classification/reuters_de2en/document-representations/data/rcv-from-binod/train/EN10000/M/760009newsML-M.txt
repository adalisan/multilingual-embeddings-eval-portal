NYMEX August Palo Verde ( PV ) electricity futures expired up Monday after posting new contract highs , while August California-Oregon Border went the off board lower . 
&quot; Cash definitely influenced things today , &quot; a West Coast broker said , referring to the impact of stronger Southwest spot physical prices on PV futures . 
some players also attributed sharply higher August PV futures to a panic to cover short positions ahead of expiry .

the adjoining unit 5 with the same generating capacity , which was shut earlier this month to repair its high pressure generator field , was still planned to restart next week . 
damage to a fish ladder at the Bonneville Dam on Columbia River in Oregon could reduce power output at the project by 200 MW for a month or two . 
to clear space for future runoffs , the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation was scheduled on Sunday to begin releasing extra water and producing more electricity at its Hoover , Davis and Parker hydroelectric projects .
