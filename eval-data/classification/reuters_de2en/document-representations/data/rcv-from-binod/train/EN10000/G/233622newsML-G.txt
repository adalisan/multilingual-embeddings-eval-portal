the Central African Republic , paralysed by an army mutiny , has cancelled plans for a state funeral for self-styled emperor Jean-Bedel Bokassa for fear of violence , family members said on Wednesday . 
Eugene Katouka , a relative and funeral organiser , said Bokassa , who died on November 3 of a heart attack , would be buried in his southern ancestral village of Berengo on December 10 &quot; in a strictly family ceremony &quot; . 
he told Reuters both the government and the family feared a public funeral in the capital Bangui , which is riven by tribal animosity triggered by the mutiny , could lead to more trouble . 
authorities had planned for a public viewing of Bokassa &apos;s body in the capital &apos;s main stadium and a church service in the Roman Catholic cathedral . 
Bokassa &apos;s body was then to be transported in a road convoy for burial in Berengo , 80 km ( 50 miles ) south of Bangui . 
the planned route was to have traversed rebel strongholds of the city , where mutineers have clashed with troops loyal to President Ange-Felix Patasse . 
at least seven people have died . 
although mutineers are mainly from the Yakoma tribe , Bokassa &apos;s Ngbaka people are also well represnted in the army . 
during a more violent army uprising last May , Bokassa came out publicly in support of rebel soldiers , whose grievances over pay and conditions have now turned into political demands including Patasse &apos;s resignation . 
many rebel soldiers believe the government should show more recognition for the ex-dictator who seized power in 1966 and ruled until he was toppled in a 1979 French-backed coup . 
Bokassa suffered further humiliation including exile , a trial for murder and imprisonment .
