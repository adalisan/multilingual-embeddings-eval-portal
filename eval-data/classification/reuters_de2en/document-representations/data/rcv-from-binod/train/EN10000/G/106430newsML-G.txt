Irish Prime Minister John Bruton accused the IRA on Wednesday of betraying Northern Ireland peace hopes and behaving like Nazis with their attack on Britain &apos;s Lisburn army base this week . 
he told the Irish Parliment the guerrillas had completed a &quot; terrible triangle &quot; this year by relaunching attacks against Britain , striking at the Lisburn base and killing an Irish policeman in a bungled bank raid in Adare , Ireland . 
Bruton said it appeared the IRA would only end violence when it got the terms for talks it wanted and likened the movement to Germany &apos;s Nazis . 
&quot; The Irish state cannot be hostage to tactical manoeuvres by a violent movement that is only willing to give up the option of violence if its get the terms that it has dictated to everyone else . 
&quot; Those are the classic tactics of the ( German ) National Socialists and Fascists during the 1920s and 1930s , &quot; he said . 
the IRA says its Sinn Fein political wing should be allowed to take part in peace talks unconditionally and rejects British and Irish insistence that it agree to disarm as a precondition . 
it was Bruton &apos;s most outpspoken criticism of the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) since he came to power two years ago and brought relations between Dublin and Sinn Fein , to their lowest point . 
Bruton called on all parties to condemn the IRA and to deepen its isolation from mainstream politics after a bombing which re-opened fears of a return to daily violence in Northern Ireland after a two-year respite . 
Ireland and Britain have refused ministerial talks with Sinn Fein since the IRA ended a 17-month ceasefire in February and are adamant that only a new , genuine truce will allow the party led by Gerry Adams a seat at Belfast peace talks . 
&quot; The Lisburn bombing is a cynical betrayal by the IRA of the peace process . 
the IRA have now completed a terrible triangle , &quot; the Irish premier , Britain &apos;s partner in the Northern Ireland peace process , said . 
&quot; This betrayal came from an organisation that told democratic politicians that their original ceasefire would hold in all circumstances , &quot; Bruton said . 
he queried whether the IRA or Sinn Fein had ever been serious about peaceful dialogue when the guerrillas declared a ceasefire in August 1994 which raised hopes across the island of a lasting political settlement . 
he asked whether the 1980s IRA strategy of guerrilla attacks and political activity had ever changed . 
&quot; Is the Armalite in one hand and the ballot box in the other the unchanged and unchanging political strategy of the republican movement ? 
&quot; Was there ever a fundamental departure from that strategy by the movement as a whole ? 
&quot; he asked . 
the Irish constitution lays claim to Northern Ireland but Bruton and his predecessors say that the text could be changed if Northern Ireland &apos;s pro-British Unionists and pro-Irish nationalists worked out a settlement for themselves .
