a hectic day &apos;s trading in commodities markets on Monday was dominated by a fund-led sell-off which saw cocoa diving by as much as five percent . 
the cocoa sell-off came as New York &apos;s equivalent market opened sharply lower on fund selling . 
a fall in German grind data , an indicator of the level of demand , was also a negative for cocoa , traders said , even though it was largely expected . 
may cocoa futures fell to a low of 968 stg per tonne before making a small recovery to close at 994 stg , still 50 stg lower . 
and base metals had an eventful day on the London Metal Exchange , first extending Friday &apos;s falls in aggressive fund-led selling before reclaiming some losses when Wall Street opened higher . 
&quot; It &apos;s been a rollercoaster day , although more down than up , &quot; said metals analyst Robin Bhar of brokers Brandeis . 
but the fund selling which swept metals prices lower in the morning and midday trading sessions tapered off in the afternoon , helping to stabilise prices , he said . 
the flagship three-month copper price ended $ 58 lower at $ 2,278 per tonne . 
some traders said the fund sell-off in all the base metals was probably sparked by losses sustained by aluminium futures on the Tokyo commodity exchange amid speculative selling . 
but some of the selling appeared to be distress sales by funds who had been caught out in other markets , Bhar noted . 
Gyrations in stock and bond markets may yet have further repercussions in the metals , he added . 
coffee managed to buck the general downtrend and tail off its heavy falls seen at the end of last week to end the day slightly higher . 
benchmark May robusta futures closed six dollars higher at $ 1,575 per tonne . 
worries about the weather sent grain and soybean prices sailing higher in the U.S. 
on the Chicago Board of Trade ( CBOT ) wheat opened higher in fast dealings on concerns that cold weather would damage winter wheat crops and that flooding in the northern Plains would delay spring wheat seedings , traders said . 
and the uptrend extended to soybeans where traders said prices also opened higher in fast dealings on reports of an early frost in South America . 
may soybean futures were up 15 at $ 8.56 per bushel . 
precious metals displayed a positive mood , buoyed by a jump higher by palladium after news of a supply delay from Russia . 
palladium closed $ 5.25 higher at $ 152.50 , carrying platinum higher with it . 
gold also ended up at $ 349.30 per ounce . 
IPE Brent crude oil futures were in strong form , rising 34 cents to $ 18.02 per barrel basis May .
