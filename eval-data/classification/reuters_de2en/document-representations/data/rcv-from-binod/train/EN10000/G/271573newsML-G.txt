Cesare Maldini will face his first test as coach of Italy in a friendly against Northern Ireland on January 22 , the Italian soccer federation said on Saturday . 
the match will kick off in the Sicilian capital of Palermo at 1930 GMT , the federation said in a statement . 
Maldini , who won the last three European titles as coach of Italy &apos;s under-21 squad , took over the senior side last Sunday after Arrigo Sacchi resigned to return as trainer of AC Milan , his former club . 
the friendly will be Maldini &apos;s only warm-up before a key World Cup qualifier against England at Wembley on February 12 .
