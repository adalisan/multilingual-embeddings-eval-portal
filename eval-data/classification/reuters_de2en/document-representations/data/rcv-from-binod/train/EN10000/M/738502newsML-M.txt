IPE Brent futures closed down 57 cents and at the lows on Friday after U.S. Gulf producers brushed off fears of major hurricane damage and prepared to resume operations . 
front month September last traded at $ 18.12 a barrel , one cent off the low , in line with an afternoon slide that embraced all IPE and NYMEX crude and products . 
next support for September Brent is around $ 17.84 , one broker said . 
the immediate trigger for the slump in values was a move by U.S. Gulf producers to prepare for restarts at platforms and other facilities after Hurricane Danny passed the U.S. oil refining and offshore production belt . 
oil companies who evacuated personnel from U.S. Gulf rigs and installations ahead of Hurricane Danny were sending crews back to work after the storm passed across the Louisiana coast with relatively little incident . 
the storm and news of supply problems in the North Sea had pushed the market higher on Thursday . 
unleaded gasoline , which helped push the market higher earlier in the week after bearish industry stock data showed a four million barrel draw , had already been coming off before it was clear the hurricane threat had receded . 
August unleaded was down 1.84 cent a gallon at 60.05 . 
further impetus to go short came from anticipation of possible bearish news about fresh progress next week on resuming Iraqi oil exports , brokers said . 
&quot; Most people were looking slightly longer term at Iraq . 
everyone is happy to be short at this stage , &quot; said one trader . 
hopes of progress in moves to restart Iraq exports have risen because U.N. Seceretary-General Kofi Annan is due to receive an aid distribution plan on Monday . 
Annan must approve the plan to allow the restart of exports under the &quot; oil-for-food &quot; scheme which allows Baghdad an exemption to broader sanctions to alleviate the suffering of ordinary Iraqis . 
Antonio Monteiro , hed of the U.N. sactions committee on Iraq , hopes that renewed oil sales can start in the first week of August , Western diplomats in New York said .
