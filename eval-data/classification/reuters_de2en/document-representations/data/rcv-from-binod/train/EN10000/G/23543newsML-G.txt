Aravinda de Silva once again 
proved to be Australia &apos;s nemesis as he guided Sri Lanka to a 
four-wicket win in a singer world series day-night match on 
Friday . 
the Sri Lankan vice-captain , who scored an unbeaten century 
against Australia in the World Cup final in Lahore earlier this 
year , rescued his team from a perilous 81 for five with a superb 
innings of 83 not out off 95 balls to see them home with 4.1 
overs to spare . 
chasing Australia &apos;s 228 for nine in 50 overs , the Sri 
Lankans got off to a fine start with Sanath Jayasuriya smashing 
one six and eight fours in a typically rapid-fire innings of 44 
off 28 balls . 
they had reached 78 for one in just 12 overs but with the 
run out of Asanka Gurusinha for 16 , the innings went into 
decline as they lost four wickets for three runs . 
Damien Flemming did the damage as he removed Jayasuriya , 
captain Arjuna Ranatunga and Hashan Tillekeratne in the space of 
nine balls . 
however , de Silva found a good ally in Roshan Mahanama and 
the pair forged a vital 115-run partnership for the sixth wicket 
which turned the tide once again in favour of the home team . 
Mahanama completed a well-struck half-century off 78 balls 
which included three fours but was bowled soon afterwards for 
exactly 50 as he moved too far across to Glenn McGrath and lost 
his leg stump . 
it was too late for the Australians , though , and man of the 
match de Silva , who hit 11 fours in his innings , saw Sri Lanka 
home . 
Upul Chandana had earlier played an important role by taking 
a career-best three for 38 from his 10 overs as Australia were 
restricted to 228 for nine . 
bowling his leg-spinners with great accuracy , Chandana 
picked up the wickets of Michael Bevan , Australia &apos;s top scorer 
with 56 off 79 balls , Darren Lehmann and Jason Gillespie . 
mark Waugh had got the innings off to a good start with a 
stylish 50 off 55 balls and Ricky Ponting later struck an 
unbeaten 46 off 57 balls but the Australians were always 30 runs 
short .
