the zinc concentrates market is heading for a record deficit this year following a series of mine closures and cutbacks which will push treatment charges sharply lower , Billiton metals Limited said in its weekly report . 
Billiton forecasts a concentrates deficit of 89,000 tonnes of contained zinc in 1997 compared to a modest surplus of 26,000 tonnes last year . 
Billiton also forecast a deficit of 155,000 tonnes of refined metal output this year , up from last year &apos;s shortfall of 115,000 tonnes . 
&quot; It would appear that the balance of power has swung clearly in favour of miners , with treatment charges likely to be considerably lower than those agreed last year at around $ 190 / tonne , &quot; Billiton said . 
&quot; Nevertheless , it has been mooted that the recent rally in zinc prices might encourage mine restarts , thereby improving the smelters &apos; position somewhat . 
the annual meeting of the American zinc Association is being held here , traditionally an event where treatment charges are discussed and even concluded . 
delegates said on Tuesday morning that no benchmark deals have been concluded yet , but there there was still a slim chance of settlement in European smelter negotiations with North American miners . 
the Japanese smelter pool was not expected to meet with its concentrates suppliers until later this month . 
Korea zinc Corp was still thought to be in negotiation as well . 
there was talk of a small deal concluded here at &quot; just below $ 180 a tonne &quot; , but smelters were said to be still &quot; playing hardball &quot; in a bid to minimise this year &apos;s inevitable cut in TCs , delegates said . 
&quot; It &apos;s all about the balance of power . 
the smelters want to show that they still hold the power in these talks , &quot; one delegate said . 
but with shortages of concentrates looming this year , some analysts believe that one or more of the European smelters may have to cut refined metal output , especially after MIM Holdings told a few it was cutting deliveries by half in 1997 . 
although Canadian miner Cominco said it was offering higher escalators this year in return for a much lower base treatment charges , European smelter sources said Tuesday that because of the protracted nature of this year &apos;s talks , deals may well follow last year &apos;s escalator levels of 13 to 15 cents . 
the European smelter official added that if they did not settle this week in Scottsdale , it was likely that Europe and Japan would settle about the same time before the end of February .
