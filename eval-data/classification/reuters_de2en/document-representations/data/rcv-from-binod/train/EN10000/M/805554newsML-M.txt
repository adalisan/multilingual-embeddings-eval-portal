SIMEX Euroyen futures eked out slight gains on Monday in line with the longer end of the yield curve following a sell-off in Nikkei stocks and futures . 
Tokyo stocks slumped alongside other Asian bourses after the Dow &apos;s second biggest point drop in history last Friday . 
the 225-share Nikkei average ended 284.93 points lower at 19,041.10 while its September futures contract lost 380 points to 19,050 on SIMEX . 
&quot; The initial weakness in the Nikkei supported the JGBs ( Japanese government bond futures ) and there was a follow-through to the Euroyen . 
but there was basically no news today , &quot; a trader at a U.S. futures house said . 
the lead March Euroyen contract inched to a new high of 99.27 against its IMM close at 99.25 . 
dealers said the contract would have trouble climbing above the 99.29 / 30 region given that the Bank of Japan was unlikely to cut the official discount rate from its present low of 0.50 percent . 
September JGBs ended at 126.97 against their previous 126.85 . 
dealers said the market was struggling to extend any rises beyond the 127.00 level . 
Eurodollar futures ended mostly firmer as players practically ruled out the likelihood of a U.S. rate hike at the Federal Reserve &apos;s policy-setting meeting on Tuesday . 
&quot; There &apos;s no real need for a rate hike . 
the economy still looks comfortable , &quot; a dealer at a Japanese house said . 
he added that December Eurodollars showed upside potential to 94.24 / 25 . 
March were at 94.xxx against 94.075 .
