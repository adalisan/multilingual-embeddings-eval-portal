Canadian spot natural gas prices moved little in quiet Wednesday trade , as the market shrugged off a late winter blizzard and cold temperatures in Alberta . 
&quot; We saw at the beginning of the week that people were holding off selling preparing for this , &quot; a Calgary-based trader said . 
&quot; It has made it into a non-event . 
spot gas at the AECO hub was quoted at C $ 1.45 / 1.46 per gigajoule , up about a penny from Tuesday and five cents from last week . 
April prices were discussed at C $ 1.435 / 1.45 , also up five cents on the week . 
Alberta temperatures , which were at -15 Celsius ( 5 Fahrenheit ) on Wednesday ) amid heavy snowfall , were forecast to climb back to above the freezing point by the weekend , Environment Canada said . 
East and west export prices were stronger on Wednesday . 
traders pegged Sumas , Wash. spot gas as high as US $ 1.22 per million British thermal units , up about 6 cents from Tuesday , as cooler weather and word that spot electricity prices were set to increase in the Pacific Northwest on Thursday boosted demand . 
in southern Ontario , prices also climbed about 6 cents from Tuesday at Dawn and Niagara , where snow and temperatures below freezing were forecast . 
prices for gas headed for Midwest U.S. markets were unchanged on the week and up about a cent from Tuesday .
