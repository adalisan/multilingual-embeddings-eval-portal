Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan said on Thursday a prime ministry report had called for another 35 people to be investigated over a scandal about links between the state and underworld gangs . 
&quot; The decision was made to open an investigation into 35 more people alongside those already being investigated , &quot; Erbakan told reporters after meeting President Suleyman Demirel . 
he did not say how many were already being investigated . 
Erbakan commissioned the report seven weeks ago following a car crash in which a wanted gangster , Abdullah Catli , and a leading policeman died in the same car . 
Sedat Bucak , a government MP leading a Kurdish clan paid by the state to fight separatist Kurdish rebels , was in the car but escaped with minor injuries . 
the report has been passed to the Justice Ministry which will decide what legal action to take , Erbakan said . 
he said the Justice Ministry would make a statement on Friday about the report , which also called for 85 people to be questioned . 
a parliamentary commission is also expected to produce a report on the incident after a four-month investigation . 
in December , the Justice Ministry rejected a prosecutor &apos;s report calling for lifting deputy Mehmet Agar &apos;s parliamentary immunity in connection with the crash . 
Agar quit as interior minister in November and was subsequently accused of having signed a false police identity document for Catli , who was allegedly used by officials to kill Turkey &apos;s political opponents . 
the media and opposition have alleged that leading officials directed hit squads to kill Kurdish rebel sympathisers and business rivals . 
more than 1,300 people have died since 1992 in unsolved political killings , human rights activists say .
