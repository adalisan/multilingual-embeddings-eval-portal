Belgian linear bonds , which recouped Thursday &apos;s losses in active business on Friday , are set to trade sideways on Monday and Tuesday in view of the upcoming OLO auction and expected U.S. interest rate rise , traders said . 
&quot; With Monday &apos;s auction and the likely rate decision on Tuesday it would be dangerous to take a position , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; So the market will be flat early next week . 
traders said the market had already factored in a 25 basis point rise in U.S. interest rates at Tuesday &apos;s meeting of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee . 
&quot; If it is 25 points the market will move up again . 
only if it is more will the market not take it kindly , &quot; one trader said . 
traders said there was activity all along the yield curve , but it was particularly noticeable in the 10-year benchmark BE286 = and the longer maturities . 
&quot; There was really very good volume . 
the longer end was very well bid . 
it flattened compared with yesterday , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; The benchmark was also active . 
traders said an added element of uncertainty was Monday &apos;s Belgian bond auction . 
they did not expect the Treasury to offer much of OLOs 25 and 26 at the auction . 
added to this is an estimated 40 to 50 billion francs worth of coupons coming to maturity on March 28 . 
&quot; I expect most of this to come back into the market , which will provide good support , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; If it doesn &apos;t come back it will be bad for bonds , but I expect it to . 
it essentially has nowhere else to go . 
we will see on Tuesday . 
&quot; It is mainly insurance and pension funds so I expect they will reinvest in this market , &quot; another trader said . 
the yield of the benchmark March 2007 OLO ended Friday at 6.07 percent , down from Thursday &apos;s closing 6.11 . 
the spread over German Bunds was 14 basis points , down from Thursday &apos;s 16 . 
&quot; It could widen a bit against early next week , &quot; one trader said . 
the March futures contract ended Friday 37 basis points higher at 120.32 , reversing Thursday &apos;s losses . 
June futures were up 36 basis points at 119.44 .
