Ireland &apos;s Exchequer Returns for end-September showed a surplus of 185 million punts , the Department of Finance said on Wednesday . 
the Department of Finance said tax revenue trends , which had been obscured at end-June by a timing shift of corporation tax receipts into July , continued to be strong during the third quarter as a whole . 
&quot; Tax revenue climbed rapidly in the final months of 1995 after a relatively weak first half and 1996 monthly inflows have already begun to reflect this base-year effect : the present year-on-year margin of 10.7 percent represents a decline from a peak of 12.2 percent recorded at end-July , &quot; the department said . 
it said all tax heads , with the exception of Customs Duties , will exceed target at the end of the year . 
it said this provided strong evidence that the economy has continued to grow much more strongly than had been projected in January . 
&quot; This once-off gain had not been anticipated in the budget arithmetic and will bring the outturn for non-tax revenue ahead of target , &quot; the statement said .
