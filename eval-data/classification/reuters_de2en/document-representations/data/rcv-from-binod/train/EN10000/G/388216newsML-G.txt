Chinese-American human rights activist Harry Wu predicted on Wednesday the death of China &apos;s leader Deng Xiaoping would spark a power struggle . 
Deng , 93-year-old architect of China &apos;s market-oriented economic reforms , died late on Wednesday of complications from Parkinson &apos;s disease and a lung infection . 
although he died as just a common member of the Communist Party , having retired from his last official position in 1990 , he remained the No . 
1 leader because &quot; this is an empire system , &quot; Wu said . 
&quot; The empire system is always looking for No . 
1 . who will become the next real emperor ? 
that means a power struggle , &quot; Wu , a longtime critic of China &apos;s prison system , told Reuters in a telephone interview from his northern California home . 
&quot; If the power struggle is only limited to the Forbidden City and they kill each other ... 
that &apos;s their business , &quot; he said . 
but he said there was a danger of civil war . 
looking back over Chinese history , he said , the power struggle went on and on . 
sometimes it was limited to the palace and sometimes it turned the whole society upside down . 
Wu said Deng &apos;s death was an encouragement for the Chinese dissident movement . 
Deng has &quot; two bloody hands . 
he is a criminal , &quot; he said , referring to Deng &apos;s role in suppressing the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations and earlier crackdowns . 
Wu , born in Shanghai , spent 19 years in Chinese labour camps in the 1960s and 1970s and has since devoted himself to exposing alleged human rights abuses in the prison system . 
he left China in 1985 and became a U.S. citizen . 
Wu was arrested agains after entering China in 1995 in an incident that chilled Sino-U.S. relations and was expelled soon after being sentenced to 15 years in jail for spying . 
Wu is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution in California and executive director of the Laogai Research Foundation , a group that investigates Chinese labour camps . 
Wu said Deng was the architect of China &apos;s &quot; so-called reform , openness &quot; and that policy had brought an improvement in the country &apos;s economic development . 
&quot; The other result is amazing . 
the Communist system survives in China , &quot; he said , noting that it had failed everywhere else . 
Wu said Deng &apos;s death would not stop economic reform in China . 
&quot; Nobody can stop it . 
this is a historical current , the energy coming from the people , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Deng Xiaoping was very clever . 
he said &apos; Let &apos;s forget talking about ideology . 
but Wu said he did not foresee more political freedom in China in the next five years . 
&quot; In 100 years , definitely yes .
