the won finished lower versus the dollar on Monday pressured by large import deals and the dollar &apos;s strength against the Japanese yen in world markets , traders said . 
some long dollar holders squared their positions in the afternoon , but failed to erase losses in early trading , they said . 
the won closed at 893.10 , compared with Friday &apos;s close of 892.70 . 
it traded in a range of 893.00 to 896.50 . 
traders said the won started weak early in the session in line with the dollar &apos;s rise against the yen . 
however , the fall was halted as rumours that the central bank would stand firm behind the won spread . 
&quot; The sentiment turned bearish in the afternoon and longs started selling , &quot; said a foreign bank dealer . 
traders expect Tuesday &apos;s trading to depend heavily on the dollar / yen movement . 
&quot; The dollar could shoot up to 900 if the dollar / yen soars , &quot; said the foreign bank dealer .
