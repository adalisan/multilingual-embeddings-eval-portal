active fund selling , thought to be further long liquidation , added to pressure from a weak cash market and knocked CME March lumber futures down for a $ 10.00 per thousand board foot limit loss , traders said . 
March was off the daily allowable $ 10.00 limit at $ 401.80 per tbf with other months off $ 6.50 to up $ 1.20 at 1155 CST . 
reports that more wholesalers were offering spruce at $ 390 per tbf , well under mill asking levels , prompted renewed pressure in futures . 
prices had recovered from early lows on short covering but follow-through demand was lacking . 
funds liquidated on the break , traders said .
