Argentine stocks closed at session highs in slack trade Tuesday and were seen firm Wednesday , with hopes focused on the imminent launch of a $ 2.0 billion bond deal , dealers said . 
&quot; The market is still clearly on an upward path and although there was scant volume today , the lack of selling drove prices higher , &quot; said Jose Napoli of Ignoto y Napoli traders . 
the blue-chip MerVal index .MERV rose 1.0 percent to 663.49 , its highest level in nearly three years , while the broad market advanced 1.3 percent . 
Argentina is due to make its debut in the global bond market this year with a $ 2.0 billion placement , to be issued in two equal tranches of five and 20 years , according to local economy ministry sources . 
the deal was expected to be announced as early as Tuesday night and no later than next week . 
&quot; Argentina has raced ahead to launch its bond and take advantage of fresh investment fund cash flows at the start of the year , and many investors may feel it is a safer option than Mexico , &quot; said one emerging markets analyst , referring to Mexico &apos;s new $ 1.0 billion 10-year bond issue . 
the day &apos;s star performer was oil giant YPF , the market bellwether , which rose 2.4 percent to $ 25.75 . 
&quot; YPF has no near-term technical ceiling after conquering the key barrier of $ 24.87 ( last month ) , and gains are driven by strong demand for heating oil in the United States which is pushing crude prices higher , &quot; said Napoli . 
session winners outpaced losers 31 to 22 , with 16 issues closing flat . 
top MerVal gainers were construction stock Polledo and steelmaker Acindar , which jumped 4.8 percent and 2.4 percent respectively . 
Main-tier losses were led by pulp and paper maker Celulosa and power utility Central Costanera , which shed 2.9 percent and 2.6 percent , respectively .
