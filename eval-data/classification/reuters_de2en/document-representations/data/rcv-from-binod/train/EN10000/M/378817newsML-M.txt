U.S. Midcontinent jet fuel basis was steady in Chicago amidst negotiations aimed at averting a strike by American Airlines pilots , traders said on Friday . 
traders said jet basis , which has been climbing steadily , could take a quick dive if the airline fails to forge a new Labor pact with its pilots in eleventh-hour talks in Washington . 
&quot; It could take a dive , but ( President ) Clinton could also come in and put them back in the air , &quot; one trader said . 
American , which has a hub at Chicago &apos;s O &apos;Hare International airport , has made contingencies for its fuel needs in the event of a strike or settlement , traders said . 
&quot; They have their battle plans already in place , &quot; one trader said . 
American has 344 daily departures and 48 gates at the Chicago airport , and also operates hubs at Dallas / Fort worth International , Miami International and JFK International in New York . 
Chicago jet / kero was talked steady at bids 6.25 cents a gallon over the NYMEX March heating oil futures for prompt and late-month deliveries . 
Group Three jet / kero was talked 8 cents a gallon over the print . 
trade was relatively quiet across the board , with differentials on unleaded and diesel barrels talked unchanged against modestly higher futures prices , traders said .
