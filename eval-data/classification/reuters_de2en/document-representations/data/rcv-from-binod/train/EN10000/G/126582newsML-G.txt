the conservative opposition National Action Party ( PAN ) has maintained its lead leading up to next year &apos;s first election for governor of Mexico City , according to a poll released on Thursday . 
the poll of 600 Mexico City residents in October was conducted by Indemerc Louis Harris . 
the PAN has held a solid lead since the poll began last November . 
the PAN scored 37 percent , up from 36 percent in August and far ahead of the leftist opposition Democratic Revolution Party ( PRD ) with 22 percent , Indemerc Louis Harris said . 
the PRD , however , improved four percentage points from the August poll . 
as it has since April , the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( pri ) trailed , this time with 12 percent , down from 13 percent from August . 
none of the parities have nominated a candidate yet .
