Colombia , already the undisputed kidnap capital of the world , saw an 18.5 percent rise in the number of reported abductions in 1996 -- one every six hours and 20 minutes -- police chief Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano said on Thursday . 
but one Western defence official believes the real number of kidnappings may be as much as four times higher than the 1,375 cases officially reported , as families prefer to negotiate privately for their loved ones than risk a botched rescue by the authorities . 
Serrano offered better results in Colombia &apos;s never-ending drug war , announcing that 2,788 drug traffickers , 125 of them foreigners , had been arrested in 1996 -- a 2.4 percent increase on 1995 figures . 
&quot; The country has had its problems but there have also been positive results particularly in the fight against the curse of drug trafficking , &quot; Serrano told a news conference at National Police headquarters in Bogota . 
of the 1,375 people abducted this year , the police &apos;s elite anti-kidnap squad , trained by Britain &apos;s Special Air Services , managed to rescue just 199 . 
one of the cases that most shocked Colombia was the kidnap of a 7-year-old boy in the southwest city of Pereira late last month . 
he was killed and his lifeless body dumped outside his home when his parents failed to come up with the ransom . 
police say they captured 429 kidnappers in 1996 . 
one of the most trumpeted arrests was that of shadowy German private eye Werner Mauss . 
he was seized near the northwest city of Medellin as he tried to smuggle a rebel kidnap victim , who was also German , out of the country on Nov . 17 . 
although drug arrests were up in 1996 , Colombia retained its position as supplier of an estimated 80 percent of the world &apos;s cocaine . 
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration also issued a report in September saying that Colombian cartels had edged out Southeast Asian gangs as the No.1 suppliers of high-purity heroin to the United States . 
Serrano said police seized 44.5 tons of cocaine , more than 240 tons of marijuana and 719 pounds ( 327 kg ) of heroin in 1996 . 
three Britons numbered among the alleged drug traffickers arrested by Colombian police . 
they were seized in the Caribbean coastal town of Barranquilla earlier this month as they allegedly tried to smuggle $ 50 million worth of cocaine out of the country . 
despite the increase in the number of drug-related arrests and the recent approval of a tough law to strip drug lords of their ill-gotten gains , political analysts said Colombia is unlikely to regain U.S. certification as an ally in the drug war . 
the status was withdrawn by Washington in March .
