Ghafoorzai said Pakistani forces had helped the Taleban in their push toward the Afghan capital and said he would present evidence on this to the Seucrity Council . 
&quot; We would like the Security Council to call on the Taleban and also their supporters to agree on a ceasefire and to a resolution of the conflict through peaceful means , &quot; he said .
