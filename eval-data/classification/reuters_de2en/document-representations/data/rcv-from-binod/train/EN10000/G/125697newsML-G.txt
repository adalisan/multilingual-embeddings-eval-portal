Austrian international defender Anton Pfeffer , who has been linked with English premier league club Tottenham said on Friday his chances of joining them were &quot; fifty-fifty . 
Pfeffer , 31 , said a decision about becoming the first Austrian to join an English premier league club would be made next week . 
talks between Pfeffer and the London club intensified after last week &apos;s World Cup group four qualifier in which Austria beat Sweden 1-0 in Stockholm . 
&quot; Playing for Tottenham would be like a dream coming true for me , &quot; said Pfeffer , who has 42 caps . 
although Pfeffer has a contract with Austria Vienna until 1998 , club manager Werner Hebenstreit said they would not stand in his way if the move looked like going ahead . 
&quot; This would be a great opportunity for him and we will not stand in his way . 
we spoke to the agent and named our price , &quot; said Hebenstreit , who did not reveal what that price was .
