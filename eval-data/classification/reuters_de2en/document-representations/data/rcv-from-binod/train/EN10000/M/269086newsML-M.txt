the Zimbabwe dollar was quoted stable on the U.S. dollar but firmer against sterling , the mark and the rand at the close of Friday &apos;s quiet interbank session , dealers said . 
&quot; The market was more on the quiet side . 
we had a few import orders and the dollar went to 10.8000 / 8200 , &quot; a dealer said , adding however : &quot; But it looks like the ( central ) Reserve Bank really want to keep our dollar at its current levels because they sold a little bit of money into the market-- not much but enough to stabilise the unit . 
the local currency ended the week at 10.7950 / 8150 against the U.S. dollar , where it closed on Thursday but was firmer on sterling at 17.9550 / 18.0000 compared to 17.9825 / 18.0240 . 
it was at 6.9320 / 9475 up from 6.9415 / 9550 versus the mark and was also stronger on the rand at 2.3065 / 3155 compared to 2.3100 / 3175 the previous day .
