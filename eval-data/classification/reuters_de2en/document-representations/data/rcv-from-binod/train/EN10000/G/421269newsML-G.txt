Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok said on Wednesday that the European Union was sending his country &apos;s foreign minister to Albania on Friday for emergency talks on a political solution to the crisis in the Balkan state . 
Kok told reporters on a visit to Paris that Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van Mierlo had spoken to Albanian President Sali Berisha earlier on Wednesday and would fly to Tirana on Friday to convey a firm message on the EU &apos;s behalf . 
&quot; We are naturally strongly in favour of a political solution . 
we are in continuous contact with several capitals , notably Athens , because the Greek government is very much concerned by delevelopments , &quot; Kok said after talks with French President Jacques Chirac . 
&quot; I can only hope that the Albanian president will find the possibility of a political solution to this problem because what is going on and what could happen there is really tragic , &quot; he said . 
French officials said the political solution would be likely to involve an electoral process . 
at least 20 people have died in unrest in Albania following the collapse of high-risk investment funds . 
under a state of emergency , army and police forces pushed towards the south on Wednesday to quash an armed rebellion and fighting was reported near the Adriatic town of Sarande . 
Albania &apos;s 11-party opposition Forum for Democracy appealed to the United States and Europe on Wednesday to help the former Stalinist country find a political solution to avoid civil war . 
the Forum for Democracy called in a statement on the international community to put pressure on Berisha and his Democratic Party government to end a state of emergency and seek a negotiated solution . 
&quot; The Forum for Democracy ... appeals to international public opinion , to the governments of the EU , USA , to the non-governmental organisations for their support to the Albanian people , &quot; the statement said . 
the alliance , grouped around the former communists , urged the West to press for an end to emergency rule introduced on Sunday and the start of dialogue with the opposition . 
it also asked the European Union to send a delegation to Tirana and said Western financial aid should be linked to a political solution . 
the Council of Europe , a pan-European organisation which promotes democracy and human rights , meanwhile announced that a delegation from its parliamentary assembly would visit Albania on Thursday and Friday to &quot; contribute to restoring civil peace &quot; . 
the delegation led by Dutch Christian Democrat Rene Van Der Linden would meet Berisha and try to see all political forces in the country , a statement issued in Strasbourg said .
