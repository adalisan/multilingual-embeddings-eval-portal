for a second straight day Wednesday , mysterious fumes smelling like cheap perfume swept through a Texas office tower , sending dozens of people to the hospital and forcing hundreds to evacuate . 
officials said 15 office workers with breathing problems , vomiting and dizziness were taken by ambulance to hospitals and another 15 were sent by bus for precautionary medical checks . 
thirty more , many of them sprawled on a grass bank and gasping for air , were given oxygen and treated by ambulance crews outside the nine-story Overton Centre office tower in southwest Fort worth . 
the fumes , which Tuesday hospitalized 72 workers and sickened 130 more , caused breathing problems and nausea again Wednesday morning just four hours after fire officials concluded it was safe for workers to go back inside . 
&quot; It &apos;s the second verse of the same song , &quot; Lt. Kent Worley of the Fort worth Fire Department said . 
&quot; We &apos;ve got exactly the same situation as ( Tuesday ) and we still don &apos;t know what is causing it . 
none of the those hospitalized were believed to be in serious condition but Wednesday &apos;s leak caused panic inside the building . 
&quot; As people were trying to make it to the bathroom , they started vomiting and some of them passed out , &quot; Stanley Harris said as he stood outside with dozens of other employees . 
Worley said the fire department &apos;s hazardous materials unit believed the mystery fumes could have come from the air-conditioning or heating systems but had been unable to find anything during several hours of tests over the two days . 
&quot; They are back in there again now . 
we are definitely going to have to find out what it is this time because something is obviously going on , &quot; he said , adding that fire officials might recommend that private sector experts on the so-called sick building syndrome be called in . 
many workers said the fumes smelled like cheap perfume and struck quickly , with some victims passing out and others vomiting or gasping for air . 
&quot; People just started passing out , crying and fainting . 
a lot of people were vomiting , &quot; said Cynthia Fisher , a quality adviser for a firm that handles customer service calls for United parcel Service . 
about 1,100 people work in the building . 
they were all told to go home and check in later Wednesday to see if it was safe to return , but some said they had no intention of going back in the afternoon . 
&quot; They don &apos;t know what it is and they still want us to go back up there ? 
I &apos;m not coming back until they know what the problem is , &quot; one woman said .
