the European Commission is to launch a public relations campaign on November 26 aimed at raising EU citizens &apos; awareness of what its single market can do for them , the EU &apos;s single market commissioner Mario Monti says . 
but Monti told Reuters in a recent interview it would still be &quot; a few years &quot; before people in the Union would be able to travel through the zone without showing their passports , a right they expected to have more than three years ago . 
under the single market , which came into force on January 1 , 1993 , goods , services , capital and people should have been able to travel throughout the Union freely in a giant border-free zone . 
Monti said he gave the market eight out of 10 for its impact on ordinary people , as opposed to business , but admitted the Commission should only get six out of 10 for its efforts to explain to people how to make use of it . 
the Commission hopes to correct that imbalance in its &quot; Citizens First &quot; campaign , which will be launched during a meeting of the Internal Market Council in Brussels on November 26 . 
through television commercials and information packs the Commission will try to inform people better of what their rights to work and study through the zone are . 
but Monti admitted that people would only accept the market was a success once they could leave their passports in their pockets when they travelled . 
&quot; The man and the woman in the street will never accept that the single market is really in place for European citizens as long as they see the persistence of internal border controls , &quot; he said . 
the Internal Market Council will this week discuss Monti &apos;s three proposed directives which will allow EU citizens and third country nationals legally resident in the EU to move around unchecked , once adequate security arrangements are in place . 
but anticipating comments by members of the European Parliament , who debate the plans in Strasbourg this week , Monti said passport-free travel could not be allowed until people could move around safely . 
he said he received as many letters from EU citizens urging increased security as he did demanding passport-free movement . 
he also rejected Irish presidency moves to move the issue to the third pillar of the Maastricht Treaty , which deals with home and justice affairs . 
if it were under the third rather than the first pillar the European Parliament and Court of Justice would no longer have any say , he said . 
Monti also said he feared third country nationals would no longer have the automatic right to enter EU states other than the one in which they were resident if the plans came under the third pillar . 
he said the Schengen free movement zone -- which is fully implemented by France , Germany , Spain , Portugal , Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg -- had proved borders could be dropped without dropping security . 
but it had its shortcomings -- notably that it was an intergovernmental arrangement , falling outside the supervision of the Parliament and Court .
