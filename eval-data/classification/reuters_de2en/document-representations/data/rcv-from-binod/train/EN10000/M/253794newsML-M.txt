buyers remained scarce in Kuala Lumpur stocks , but the decline was focused mostly on the small-capitalisation sector and accompanied by thin volume . 
&quot; People who bargain-hunt have had a lot of opportunity to buy over the last few days , &quot; said Laurence Lau , head of research at Jupiter Securities . 
&quot; One of the reasons why volume is so lacklustre is that the bargain-hunting has almost finished . 
the composite Index of 100 large stocks ended off 4.70 points to 1,199.69 . 
the Second Board index fell more , losing 5.12 points or 0.93 percent to 542.73 . 
volume totalled over 160 million shares , with losers topping gainers by 368 to 174 . 
main board stocks accounted for 131 million of the turnover . 
despite the market &apos;s declines in the past weeks , dealers said they were not concerned . 
&quot; The reason why the market has been coming down has nothing to do with Malaysia , but more with Hong Kong and Tokyo , &quot; said a Penang-based institutional dealer . 
&quot; Our market has held up very well , &quot; said Lau . 
&quot; Despite a couple of bashings , it &apos;s been able to close above 1,196 . 
&quot; He said blue chips will probably stage a rally in January .
