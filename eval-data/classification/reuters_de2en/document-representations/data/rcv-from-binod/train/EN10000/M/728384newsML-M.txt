Robusta coffee futures tumbled by nearly 10 percent basis September on Tuesday in one of the heaviest single-day losses in weeks on big fund-led selling and long liquidation . 
the avalanche of selling orders right from the opening bell took the market to the lowest levels since April 14 when it touched a low of $ 1,562 . 
&quot; It &apos;s all fund selling , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; They were long in the market , now it &apos;s not sure whether they were short of it . 
benchmark September plunged to a session low of $ 1,565 per tonne in late afternoon for a 9.8 percent loss on the day . 
Sell-stops emerged as the market broke through $ 1,700 and then $ 1,610 before hitting the floor at $ 1,565 . 
Bargain-hunting and roaster price-fixing at the lows helped the market to recover from its lows , but it still closed the day $ 150 down at $ 1,585 . 
most other months also posted heavy losses . 
origin selling was evident early in the session but producers later retreated as the market declined further . 
there were no strong signs for a bottom yet , although technically the market could rebound a bit on a correction after today &apos;s heavy sell-off , analysts said . 
a mass bale-out in coffee followed a five-month rally on tight supplies that had lifted the London market to 20-month peaks in late May at $ 2,700 . 
but since then prices have been drifting lower . 
Tuesday morning saw the September contract drop more than 5.8 percent to $ 1,635 . 
the slide gained further momentum in late afternoon , with the market piercing the important $ 1,610 support after some resistance . 
prior to this , it had been trapped in a tight $ 1,750- $ 1,860 band . 
volume was brisk at 14,935 lots , dominated by September and November contracts . 
traders said the sell-off was purely chart-driven . 
it also took little heed of relatively calm New York arabica futures . 
there were no fresh fundamental reasons . 
the winter weather in Brazil &apos;s coffee areas remained mild , with no frost forecast through July 22 , while coffee stocks in Europe and the United States were building up again . 
on the news front , traders said LIFFE certified stocks rose to 2,346 five-tonne lots at end-June from 881 in May . 
the jump was within expectations . 
the key U.S. green stocks data for June were due after the close of New York trading on Tuesday . 
broker GNI said estimates had been unreliable for the past few months , but the current range of expectations was from 200,000 bags up to 100,000 down . 
stocks fell by 110,000 tonnes in June last year . 
&quot; It is fair to say any increase in stocks will either represent stocks from Colombia or Europe , it would however be going against the seasonal norm , &quot; it added .
