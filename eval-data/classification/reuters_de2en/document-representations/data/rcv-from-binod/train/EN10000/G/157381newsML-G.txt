Council members of Germany &apos;s powerful central bank have been publically airing seemingly contradictory views on European monetary union that have unnerved financial markets . 
following are brief sketches of the 16 members of the Bundesbank &apos;s decision-making Council and what they stand for . 
the council is made up of two groups -- permanent senior officials who are members of the Frankfurt-based executive Directorate that conducts open markets operations and presidents of the regional central banks in federally-structured Germany . 
Tietmeyer , a Christian Democrat ( CDU ) , is a top ally of Chancellor Helmut Kohl . 
known as a monetary policy centrist , he joined the bank board in January 1990 after a career in Bonn ministries . 
named president in October 1993 , he wants a strict interpretation of the Maastricht Treaty and has pushed for a powerful stability pact for the future single currency . 
he also believes Exchange Rate Mechanism ( ERM ) membership is needed to join the currency union and is critical of &quot; window-dressing &quot; finance measures to meet EMU criteria . 
Gaddum , a CDU member and former president of the Rheinland-Palatinate bank , joined the Directorate in 1986 and was appointed to his current job in October 1993 . 
a centrist , he is an expert on capital markets but has limited international exposure . 
Gaddum is sympathetic to public fears about the euro and favours strict treaty interpretation . 
he favours a stability pact with automatic sanctions and converting existing German debt into euro debt as soon as possible . 
Issing , a professor who has no political affiliation , joined the council in October 1990 and is seen as a centrist on monetary issues . 
he is also critical of &quot; creative accounting &quot; to fulfill fiscal critiera and cannot rule out Germany falling short of EMU targets in 1996 . 
Hartmann , a technical banking expert with no political affiliation , joined in 1964 and was appointed to the Directorate in June 1992 . 
he chairs a working group at the European Monetary Institue , the precursor to a European central bank , on coordinating cashless payments under EMU . 
Hartmann is seen as a &quot; hawk &quot; on monetary policy who would favour interest rate hikes if necessary . 
he believes a transition period between the euro &apos;s introduction and physical distrubition should be shortened . 
joined in 1964 and the directorate in June 1992 . 
a centrist on rate policy , he believes the EMU target start date of January 1999 will be hard to meet and entrance criteria should not be relaxed . 
he also believes EMU members should not be selected before March 1998 . 
viewed as monetarist hawk , he joined the Directorate in March 1995 . 
he believes a timely start to EMU is possible if steps are taken to ensure stability and a delay could endanger the whole project . 
Meister , a Social Democrat ( SPD ) , joined the Directorate in 1993 and is considered a favourite to replace Gaddum . 
he notes public confusion on how the criteria will be interpreted and fears political pressure may push through the introduction of the new currency at any price . 
a former Bundestag member viewed as an outspoken SPD politician and expert on fiscal policy , he was named in September 1995 to his position . 
a monetarist dove , he wants EMU to start on time with a small group of nations rather than risk delay or softening criteria . 
he oversaw in 1991 introduction of a &quot; solidarity surcharge &quot; to pay for German unification . 
he is critical of nations using gimmicks to meet entry criteria . 
an SPD member and former professor , he was economics minister of North-Rhine Westphalia before taking up his current position in August 1990 . 
he , a monetarist centrist to dovish who criticised France for its budget moves , says Germany will not accept the euro if criteria are eased . 
he believes five states seek to join EMU by fudging criteria . 
he said Italy , Spain and other &quot; Club Med &quot; nations were unlikely in the first group . 
palm , a monetarist hawk , warns against using tricks to join EMU . 
favours criteria interpretation aimed at stability and wants stability pact . 
he , a monetarist dove , says an EMU delay to enlarge the group is unwise and could threaten the project . 
he sees some leeway in budget criteria but not laxity . 
he sees the euro helping to solve unemployment problems in Europe . 
he says nations do not need to hit debt criteria exactly to qualify and sees room for manoeuvre , particularly on public debt . 
he has no political affiliation and is a Club of Rome member . 
he was named bank president in December 1988 and given responsibility for more regional banks in November 1992 . 
Hesse has made little public commentary on currency union but is considered a monetary centrist to hawkish .
