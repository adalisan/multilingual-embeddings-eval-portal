until a month ago the southern Belgian town of Mons basked in anonymity , known , if at all outside the country , as the home of the military headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation . 
but Mons has gained notoriety following a string of murders by a killer who has left the neatly severed parts of his victims -- including hands , feet , arms , thighs , a head and a torso -- in black plastic rubbish bags at four locations in Mons &apos;s quaint mediaeval streets . 
police believe that at least four , possibly six , women have been killed and dismembered . 
as if following the script of a horror movie , the killer has left the bags in places with evocative names such as River Hate , Street of worry and Deposit Street . 
the most recent discoveries -- two thighs , a forearm and a hand attached to a forearm found on April 18 -- were made in Rue Saint Symphorien , named after a third century French martyr whose bones are kept as a relic in a nearby church . 
it is the killer &apos;s macabre symbolism as much as his brutality and apparent willingness to taunt police that have horrified the local population . 
&quot; My wife does not walk the dog any more . 
Mayor Maurice Lafosse has advised everyone to be vigilant but not alarmist . 
&quot; I think there is a feeling of insecurity in our town , rather than a situation of insecurity , &quot; he told Reuters , adding that he was not at all happy with the bad publicity . 
the Mons murders follow the paedophile kidnapping , sex abuse and murder scandal which has traumatised Belgium for the past nine months . 
Marc Dutroux , the main suspect in a paedophile ring which has claimed the lives of at least four girls , lived less than 40 km ( 24 miles ) from Mons . 
&quot; We are more careful than ever now . 
people were already afraid because of the Dutroux case , ( but ) this bin-bag case has made things even worse , &quot; a young woman in a Mons bar told Reuters . 
police have questioned a Belgian man who knew the only victim so far identified , 21-year-old Nathalie Godart , a homeless woman who was often seen hanging around the local station . 
it has not yet been established whether the torso of a French woman found in a bin bag in the River Hate last July was linked to the finds of the past month . 
police do not rule out that more victims , and possibly the killer , are from northern France ; the French border is just 20 km ( 12 miles ) away . 
the police are keeping a close eye on Mons streets with evocative names . 
&quot; The places where the bags have been deposited indeed have evocative names and this is an important part in our investigation , &quot; said public prosecutor spokesman Didier Vanreusel . 
as a mediaeval city , Mons has several street names whose names are laden with symbolism , although their origin is not always what it seems . 
river Hate ( La Haine ) , which gave its name to the province of Hainaut , derived its name from the celtic word for water . 
nearby River Fear ( La Trouille ) has nothing to do with anxiety either , a local historian told Reuters .
