time Warner Inc . &apos; s cable unit launched a high-speed online service called Road Runner Tuesday that will enable home computer users to steer onto the Internet through a cable network and modem . 
road Runner is up to 100 times faster than telephone-line modem Internet access , Time Warner said at the launch . 
it includes proprietary features from Time Warner properties such as news from Time , People , Money and Sports illustrated magazines , information from Time-Life Books and video clips from Warner Bros. movies . 
it offers news from local newspapers and Web sites of local museums , schools , libraries and sports franchises . 
independent suppliers will also provide general health , home improvement , investing and other information . 
the service offers unlimited Internet access for a monthly fee of $ 39.95 after an installation fee of $ 75 to $ 300 , a Time Warner spokesman said . 
the service is named for Warner Bros. &apos; s famous cartoon bird that invariably escapes from his nemisis , Wile E. Coyote . 
time Warner Cable Chairman Joseph Collins said the service was similarly fast . 
&quot; The first thing consumers will find is speed , especially if they have been plodding along on the Internet through local telephone lines , &quot; he said . 
content will be compelling as well , he said . 
time Warner spent more than $ 120 million to upgrade its 3,000-mile cable system in Akron and Canton to a hybrid fiber optic / coaxial network , he said . 
it has invested billions nationally to upgrade networks for improved cable television service including more channels , and for telephone service and applications such as Road Runner , Collins said . 
&quot; We are substantially along ... in upgrading the infrastructure of the cable system , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We hope to complete ( the upgrade ) well before the end of the century . 
available only in Time Warner &apos;s Akron-Canton , Ohio , division , Road Runner will arrive in other cities as the cable firm expands its broadband network , Collins said . 
Elmira and Corning , N.Y. , will offer Road Runner later this year , and it will be available in San Diego , Caoif . , by early next year , Collins said . 
other cities where Time Warner operates cable networks will follow , he said . 
time Warner , the second largest U.S. cable network with 1.8 billion customers , plans to provide the service and modems free to local schools . 
Collins declined to make specific financial projections about Road Runner or say how many subscribers were expected . 
&quot; We think it will make a very significant contribution ( to both revenue and , eventually , earnings ) , &quot; he said . 
the launch , attended by community leaders , bugs Bunny and other Warner characters , was at Akron &apos;s Inventure Place , a hands-on science learning centre and museum that houses the National inventors Hall of fame . 
for the Akron-Canton system , Motorola , Inc. built the cable modems that connect the cable network with customers &apos; personal computers , and Hewlett-Packard Co. built Road Runner &apos;s computer servers and routers . 
executives of those companies said they also expected significant business opportunities from Road Runner . 
users will navigate Road Runner using a customised version of Microsoft Corp. &apos; s explorer 3.0 Internet browser . 
Microsoft &apos;s Craig Mundie , also in Akron for the launch , said his company is providing the browser free in hopes of &quot; selling people our entire software system . 
MCI Communications Corp. is also working with Time Warner on the service , Time Warner said . 
fewer than 500 Akron and Canton households receive Road Runner now . 
time Warner said another 1,000 were on a list waiting for installation even before the formal launch . 
some personal computers may not accommodate Road Runner , which requires at least a 486SX / 33MHz processor with adequate memory . 
Collins said the company believed Road Runner &apos;s appeal will go beyond current online buffs to attract new customers who have until now avoided home computers .
