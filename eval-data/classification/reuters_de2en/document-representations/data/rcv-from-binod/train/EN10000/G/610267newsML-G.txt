the ex-mayor of the French Riviera resort of Cannes was taken to hospital on Friday as he continued a hunger strike to press for his release from 10-month-old pre-trial custody , medical sources said . 
Michel Mouillot , of the centre-right Union for French Democracy party , was detained last July after being placed under investigation over accusations he solicited bribes in exchange for permits to install one-arm bandits in a hotel casino . 
&quot; There is no other example of such long pre-trial custody in political corruption cases , &quot; Mouillot &apos;s lawyer Francois Saint-Pierre said earlier this week when it became known his client had been on hunger strike for several days . 
Mouillot resigned as mayor in February after the Supreme Court upheld an 18-month prison sentence he was given in a separate case for receiving a fictitious salary from a Lyon businessman . 
he was also barred from holding public office for five years .
