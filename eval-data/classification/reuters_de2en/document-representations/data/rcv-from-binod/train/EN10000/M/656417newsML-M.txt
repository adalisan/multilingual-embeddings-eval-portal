Istanbul shares lost an average 1.99 percent in selling on Thursday as mounting political uncertainty spooked the market , but recovered from afternoon lows on fresh support , brokers said . 
the IMKB National-100 closed 33 points , or 1.99 percent , lower at 1,627 after rebounding from a low of 1,617 . 
daily trade volume declined to 20.91 trillion lira from Wednesday &apos;s 22.73 trillion . 
brokers said the index met support at the index &apos;s 1,620 level after 1,650 was pierced down in the morning . 
&quot; The latest news about the future of the coalition undermined the market . 
furthermore resistance at the index &apos;s 1,680 could not be broken in last week &apos;s rally and volume was insufficient , &quot; said Neslihan Kacamak from BAB securities . 
&quot; So the market looked for renewed support . 
the index may again test 1,580-1,620 range for support on Friday because investors will not want to keep share positions over the weekend , &quot; she added . 
Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan held a three-way meeting with a small but key rightist party and deputy PM Tansu Ciller , whose conservative True Path Party has threatened to pull out of the coalition within a week . 
true Path , a pro-Western party , said on Wednesday night it would withdraw from the government if Ciller were not made prime minister by June 18 under a plan to deflect criticism of the alliance by the powerful army . 
Erbakan and Ciller announced on June 1 that they would seek snap polls to overcome a dispute between the government and the secularist army . 
under the plan , Erbakan would hand over power to Ciller who would head a caretaker government to prepare for the elections . 
however , Turkish law requires the president and later parliament to approve any alteration in government , and it remains uncertain the coalition , with a thin majority , could see through any such change and pass an early election law . 
the army and the ruling Islamists have been engaged in a political struggle since February when a military-dominated security council ordered a crackdown on religious activity in public life . 
the military repeated its warnings on religious activism at Wednesday &apos;s briefing to media members . 
of the 244 shares traded , falls outdid rises by 166 to 30 and 48 closed stable . 
leading actives were utility Cukurova Elektrik , down 5,000 lira at 220,000 , car and commercial vehicle maker Otosan , , down 3,000 lira at 77,000 and utility Kepez Elektrik , down 5,000 lira at 275,000 .
