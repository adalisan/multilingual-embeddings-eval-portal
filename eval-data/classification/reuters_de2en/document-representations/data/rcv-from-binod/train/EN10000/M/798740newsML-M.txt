pharmaceutical producer Sanitas grabbed the limelight on Lithuania &apos;s bourse on Thursday as 50 percent of its shares were sold to foreign investors in a deal worth 33.5 million litas . 
shares extended recent gains and dealers were hopeful that growing foreign interest would spark more activity on the market , which has been stuck in the doldrums for much of the summer . 
the official list index crept up 10.89 points to 1142.23 while the broader gorup A index advanced 38.36 points to 1977.83 . 
four of the five official list stocks gained with only one easing . 
Central market volume reached 1.17 million litas while block trades turned over 35.74 million litas . 
Sanitas accounted for the lion &apos;s share of activity as foreign funds snapped up 50 percent of its shares at 96 litas a piece . 
&quot; Eight foreign funds and persons bought the shares , &quot; Arvydas Jacikevicius , a dealer with Suprema , told Reuters . 
he said that Suprema registered the deal but declined to say which funds or persons were involved . 
on the official list , Rokishkis cheese rose to 49.52 litas from 49.00 litas in trade worth 261,000 litas . 
it also turned over 896,000 litas in block trades with prices ranging from 49.52 litas to 50.00 litas . 
dealers said that Rokishkis &apos; solid interim results justified its recent gains and that the cheese maker had room to grow .
