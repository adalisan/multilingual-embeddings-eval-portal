the first police officers to arrive at Nicole Brown Simpson &apos;s home after she and Ronald Goldman were murdered testified on Monday that they saw only a single bloody glove at the crime scene . 
officer Robert Riske testified to finding a blue knit cap and the single leather glove under a plant near Goldman &apos;s body about two hours before Detective Mark Fuhrman arrived . 
his partner , Officer Miguel Terrazas , said that during the five hours he was at the scene in the early hours of June 13 , 1994 , he saw only one bloody glove . 
the testimony could help the plaintiffs discount a defence contention that Fuhrman took a glove from the scene and planted it on Simpson &apos;s property . 
Fuhrman , who earlier this month pleaded no contest to a single charge of perjury over his past use of racial slurs , was painted by the defence in the criminal case as a racist rogue cop who planted evidence against Simpson . 
lawyers in the civil case have said they will use similar tactics . 
Simpson , who was absent from court on Monday morning , was acquitted last October of criminal charges in connection with the June 12 , 1994 murders . 
the former football star and Hollywood actor is battling a wrongful-death civil lawsuit filed by the victims &apos; families , who are seeking financial damages for the loss of their loved ones . 
Riske , the first police officer to testify in the civil trial , described how he and Terrazas arrived at Nicole Brown Simpson &apos;s condominium , where they were directed to the two bodies by neighbours . 
&quot; I looked down the walkway and saw a female white with a black dress and blonde hair , &quot; Riske said . 
&quot; There was blood approximately half-way down the walkway , &quot; he added . 
shown a grim photo of Goldman &apos;s blood-soaked body lying in the dirt , the officer used a wooden pointer to show jurors the evidence he discovered that night . 
&quot; There &apos;s a glove and a hat underneath the plant , &quot; he said . 
as in the criminal trial , Riske also described finding a trail of bloody footprints leading to the rear of the property and several drops of wet blood on a rear gate .
