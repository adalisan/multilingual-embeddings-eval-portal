South African President Nelson Mandela began meetings in Cape Town on Wednesday with leaders of Botswana , Mozambique , Zimbabwe and Uganda on how to defuse the increasing conflicts in southern and central Africa . 
the mini-summit , scheduled for at least two meetings , is a follow up to Mandela &apos;s lightning tour of the region last week to muster support for political intervention in regional conflicts . 
a government official , who asked not to be identified , said Mandela would seek to bolster a regional peace drive in the Great Lakes region around Zaire , Rwanda and Burundi , as well as a parallel peace mission in nearby Lesotho and Swaziland . 
&quot; There are several initiatives underway in Africa at the moment , but they are all heading in one direction and they are in line with the president &apos;s concern for an African response to African problems , &quot; the official said . 
presidential spokeswoman Priscilla Naidoo said President Quett Masire of Botswana and President Joachim Chissano of Mozambique arrived first at Mandela &apos;s Tuynhuys office alongside parliament . 
she said President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe sent a message that his flight was delayed and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda was expected to arrive later . 
fighting in Zaire has increased , with the government launching air strikes this week on rebels who have seized much of the east of the country . 
Zaire says the rebels are backed by troops from neighbouring Rwanda , Uganda and Burundi , which deny involvement . 
in Lesotho , the army put down a police mutiny on Sunday and in Swaziland the economy is buckling under a three-week strike by labour unions trying to force a transition from the existing executive monarchy to democracy . 
the government official said Mandela had called the summit to look for a strategy rather than to respond specifically to existing problems in Lesotho , Swaziland and Zaire . 
&quot; The President is spending a lot more time on these regional issues this year than he has done in the past . 
&quot; The tendency will be to look first at a political response to new problems . 
the idea of military intervention is very much on the back burner , &quot; the official said . 
Mandela has escalated his peace-making efforts since he became chairman last year of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) trade group . 
the SADC last year established an Organ for Politics and Security chaired by Mugabe , but Mandela has taken a leading role in trying to establish a political mechanism to respond quickly to crises in the region . 
Mandela told then U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher last year that Africa would not welcome a Western initiative to train and finance an African peacekeeping force . 
&quot; Africa would like to feel that they are handling things themselves , &quot; he said in response to Christopher &apos;s offer to pay more than a quarter of the cost of a multi-national African force .
