NYMEX gasoline hoisted oil prices to a higher end Friday on anticipation of stronger gasoline demand amid position squaring before a long weekend . 
&quot; We are sort of in between seasons right now , and , although the gasoline season has not kicked in , people are anticipating gasoline demand to rise after it has fallen so much , &quot; said John Bradberry , a dealer at Transmontaigne Products Services Inc in Fayetville , Arkansas . 
March gasoline settled 1.07 cents a gallon higher at 64.25 cents while March crude ended up 39 cents a barrel at $ 22.41 . 
March heating oil rose 0.89 cent a gallon at 60.81 cents . 
the expiration of March crude options Friday had little notable effect on prompt crude prices , said dealers who initially expected March crude to be driven toward the $ 22.00 strike price . 
March heating oil finished 0.89 cent a gallon higher at 60.81 cents . 
gasoline typically rallys in the spring ahead of the summer driving season when gasoline demand usually peaks . 
gasoline demand traditionally suffers during the winter , however . 
on Tuesday , weekly oil inventory data for the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) showed gasoline demand at an anemic 6.709 million barrels a day for the week ended February 7 . 
Bradberry said demand was near a two-year low and that traders viewed demand as having bottomed . 
also undergirding gasoline prices was news Tosco prolonged its shut down of a gasoline making unit at its Martinez , California refinery until June , two months longer than initallly forecasted . 
the 32,000 barrel-a-day hydrocracker was shut January 21 after it exploded and burned when a hydrocarbon line ruptured . 
Meanhwile , traders were covering short positions amid uncertainty surrounding Labor strikes in Latin America &apos;s oil sector . 
dealers said players wanted to reduce risk ahead of a three day weekend . 
NYMEX energy markets were closed Monday due the U.S. Presidents Day holiday . 
public sector workers in Colombia , including those of Ecopetrol , the state oil firm , continued their nationwide strike Friday to protest wages and privatization . 
workers for Venezuela &apos;s state oil firm PDVSA conducted an eight-hour work stoppage Friday to protest working conditions . 
there have been conflicting reports on the impact of the strikes . 
but , private oil firms with interests in Colombia , such as British Petroleum , have reported that their production is unaffected . 
PDVSA said operations continued at a normal pace with the help of non-Union staff .
