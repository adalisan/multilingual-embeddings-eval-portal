a U.S. federal ethics panel will urge Congress to pass legislation allowing creation of cloned human embryos for research , but banning their use to make cloned human babies , the Washington Post reported on Wednesday . 
the newspaper , quoting several commission members , said that under the commission &apos;s plan , privately funded scientists or doctors could make cloned human embryos for research purposes but could not implant them into women &apos;s wombs . 
Members of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission said the recommendations were sensible , given the ethical complexities and the need for immediate action . 
critics , including anti-abortion activists , have pushed for a more complete ban on human cloning experiments , but researchers see cloning as a promising option for infertile couples and a possible source of medical advances . 
the Post said the ethics group , consisting of 18 experts in science , law and theology , is due to complete its work this weekend . 
the group has met five times at President Bill Clinton &apos;s request since scientists in Scotland reported in February that they had cloned an adult sheep .
