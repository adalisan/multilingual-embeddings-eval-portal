Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said on Friday he had asked India to withdraw troops from Kashmir as a gesture towards establishing a &quot; new beginning &quot; for the longtime foes . 
&quot; I have requested the Indian prime minister that troops should be withdrawn from Kashmir as a first gesture , which will help in building the atmosphere of trust , &quot; Sharif told EL TV in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday . 
Sharif met his Indian counterpart , Inder Kumar Gujral , last month on the fringes of a regional summit in the Maldives as part of an effort to ease tensions between the arch-rivals . 
two rounds of talks , one between foreign ministers and the other between lower-level officials , were held in March and April . 
the two nations &apos; foreign secretaries -- the highest ranking civil servants in the foreign ministries -- were expected to hold another round of negotiations in Islamabad later in June . 
Sharif told EL TV that it would be in both countries &apos; interest for the foreign secretaries to discuss the half-century dispute over Kashmir . 
&quot; I want to discuss all the issues but it would be better if we talk about Kashmir also , &quot; the Pakistani leader said . 
India accuses Pakistan of arming guerrillas fighting New Delhi &apos;s rule in Jammu and Kashmir state , where tens of thousands of Indian troops are stationed and more than 20,000 people have been killed in insurgency-related violence since 1990 . 
Islamabad says it offers only moral and diplomatic support to the separatists . 
asked about a statement he made as former prime minister in 1994 that Pakistan possessed an atomic bomb , Sharif declined to comment . 
Sharif said it was time India and Pakistan , which have fought three wars since independence in 1947 , put their differences aside . 
&quot; This is not the time to fight . 
we must learn from our past mistakes and should analyse what all we have gained or lost , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We fought wars and spent so much on defence budget instead of concentrating on the development of both the nations . 
we have only suffered by adopting a path of confrontation . 
it &apos;s high time we should change our attitudes , &quot; he said . 
asked whether he would push for cuts in the defence budgets of both countries , Sharif said : &quot; There will be a time when we will talk about defence budgets , but first we need to build confidence between both of us . 
Sharif said a telephone &quot; hot line &quot; between Gujral and him would be installed this month and that &quot; after that we can sort out many problems on personal level by talking to each other on telephone &quot; . 
the Pakistani leader said the two nations would soon simplify procedures for obtaining visas to visit the neighbouring country . 
he said the countries should stop harassing each other &apos;s diplomats . 
&quot; We must get out of the hang-overs of past animosity . 
if something goes wrong in India , they blame Pakistan , and if any bomb blast occurs here , we blame India . 
&quot; This has been our approach for the last 50 years . 
I want to come out of this frame of mind for a new beginning . 
Sharif said there should be more cricket matches between India and Pakistan .
