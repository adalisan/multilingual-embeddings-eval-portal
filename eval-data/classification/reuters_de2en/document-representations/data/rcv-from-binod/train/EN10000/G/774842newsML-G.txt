Shqiponja have pulled out of the second stage of the Albanian league because of financial difficulties , soccer officials said on Monday . 
Gjergj Thaka of the Albanian soccer federation said the club told them &quot; they could not finance the trips to the venues where their matches are to be held , &quot; 
Thaka said no solution had been reached . 
the second stage of the 1996-97 league , which was suspended in February due to armed civil unrest , resumed on Saturday after the government guaranteed adequate security in the stadiums . 
the new season is scheduled to begin on September 13 . 
Albanian clubs have been suspended by UEFA from the 1997-98 Cup competitions , but the national side will play a World Cup group nine home qualifier against Northern Ireland in Spain on September 10 .
