the leader of Egypt &apos;s Coptic Christian minority said on Tuesday that the massacre this month of 10 Christians in a church was carried out by Moslems but denied it was a sign of widespread civil strife in Egypt . 
it does not represent the general opinion of Moslems . 
they can not be true Moslems , &quot; said Pope Shenouda . 
&quot; We know that they are Moslems who do not represent Egypt in anything . 
Pope Shenouda was speaking to reporters after talks in Cairo with the head of Lebanon &apos;s Higher Shi &apos;ite Council , Sheikh Mohammad Mehdi Shamseddin , who also held talks with President Hosni Mubarak . 
six gunmen shocked Egypt earlier this month when they stormed a church in Abu Qurqas town in southern Egypt and sprayed bullets into the youth meeting . 
police believe they belong to the militant Al-Gama &apos;a Al-Islamiya ( Islamic Group ) . 
militants have often targeted policemen and Christians in their attempt to transform Egypt into a strict Islamic state . 
security sources said that this was the first time that gunmen attacked the interior of a church .
