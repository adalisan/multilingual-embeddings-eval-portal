ousted Afghan government commander Ahmad Shah Masood &apos;s forces fought their way forward on Tuesday towards the strategic Khair Khana pass on the main road into the Afghan capital held by the Taleban . 
&quot; We control the west side of the pass , &quot; Sabir , one of Masood &apos;s commanders in the frontline village of Hussein Kot 18 km ( 14 miles ) north of Kabul , told reporters . 
shellfire raised columns of dust on the hills around Khair Khana while heavy machinegun fire echoed around the mountains . 
&quot; We have orders to move forward and take the pass , &quot; said Sabir , in an apparent reference to calls from the two sides on Monday for a conditional ceasefire . 
doubt about where the front line is on maps has led to confusion over whether the village of Hussein Kot was in Masood &apos;s or Taleban hands . 
some locals said the name applied to a string of villages along the road , parts of which may be held by each side .
