Bulgaria expects its current account to remain in the black in the second quarter following a $ 234.7 million surplus in the first quarter and a $ 22.3 million deficit for 1996 , a Bulgarian National Bank ( BNB ) official said on Friday . 
BNB preliminary figures show the current account surplus stood at some $ 500 million at end-May against a gap of over $ 500 million a year earlier due to a rising trade surplus and an influx of capital . 
&quot; The trend towards increase in the current account surplus is expected to continue in the second quarter . 
there are no expectations of a reversal in the trend , &quot; the official , who declined to be named , told Reuters . 
Bulgaria took steps to check inflation and the Lev &apos;s depreciation prior to implementation of a currency board fixed exchange rate regime on July 1 . 
direct investment rose to $ 240 million in the first five months of this year from $ 67 million for the same period in 1996 thanks to greater financial stability and Bulgaria &apos;s moves to speed up privatisation . 
portfolio investment rose to $ 135 million at end-May from $ 20.5 million in the first quarter , mainly due to higher foreign investment in high-yield government securities . 
a $ 59 million outflow of short-term investment was registered in the first five months of 1996 , increasing to $ 169 million at end-1996 . 
exports of fuels , metals and mineral resources rose in the first five months , while exports of agricultural produce fell . 
a sharp depreciation in the Lev meant imports decreased by more than 20 percent from January through May year on year , with the biggest fall posted in imports of investment goods and imports from the European Union . 
the Lev fell to around 3,000 to the dollar in February from around 500 at end-1996 before recovering to around 1,600 in May . 
BNB foreign exchange reserves rose to $ 1.28 billion at end-May from $ 600 million a year earlier . 
figures for the second quarter are expected to be released at mid-August .
