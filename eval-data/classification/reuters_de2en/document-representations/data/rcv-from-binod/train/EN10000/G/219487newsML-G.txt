a Hungarian businessman was shot and critically wounded in what police said on Wednesday appeared to be the latest outburst in a gang war they have been unable to stop . 
Zoltan Csapo , 56 , was shot repeatedly by an attacker on a motorcycle who turned in front of the victim &apos;s jeep and fired at him on Tuesday evening . 
Csapo , who runs a truck parking lot outside Budapest , was in critical condition in hospital , officials said . 
&quot; Taking the past few day &apos;s crimes into account , the connection ( with recent hand grenade bombings ) cannot be excluded , &quot; national police spokesman Laszlo Garamvolgyi told Hungarian radio . 
Budapest has been rocked for the past two months by a gangland turf war that has included more than a dozen hand grenade attacks on nightclubs and restaurants and at least three other shootings , one of them fatal . 
Jozsef Prisztas , a known underworld figure , was shot dead at the wheel of his car on November 1 . 
he has been linked to an underworld &quot; banker &quot; , Andras Lakatos , who reportedly absconded to Mexico with billions of forints of underworld money . 
the Nepszabadsag newspaper quoted sources as saying that police had arrested the head of a company that provided security at nightclubs as a suspect in the grenade attacks . 
police confirmed that a man identified only as Tamas B. had been arrested but would not say why he was being held , the paper said . 
although no one has been injured in the grenade attacks , Budapest Mayor Gabor Demszky has said injury to a civilian was only a matter of time and has urged an intensified crackdown by the national police . 
a spokesman for the mayor &apos;s office said the City Council met last week to discuss the crime wave and agreed to provide 250 million forints for technical support for the Budapest police in 1997 . 
&quot; We cannot accept as an explanation that those who avoid the underworld environment are not threatened , &quot; Demszky said in a speech to the council . 
&quot; We cannot allow Budapest &apos;s streets and citizens to be ruled by fear . 
to avoid this is first of all the task of the police but the city will do everything it can to help keep order . 
Western diplomats said there is &quot; no imminent threat &quot; to people visiting what has become one of Europe &apos;s most popular tourist destinations . 
&quot; This is basically an organised-crime related thing and is not a threat to innocent civilians . 
let &apos;s say it &apos;s a gang war , &quot; one diplomat said . 
but diplomats noted that police have begun casting a wider net in their so-far largely fruitless efforts to put an end to the violence , including stopping and searching cars with diplomatic licence plates for the first time . 
some cars owned by diplomats have been stolen in Budapest , which has one of the highest auto theft rates in eastern Europe , and diplomats said criminals may have been using them to avoid being stopped by police in routine searches .
