Hong Kong &apos;s future leader Tung Chee-hwa on Thursday welcomed a decision by the Pacific island state of Kiribati to waive visa requirements for Hong Kong passport holders after the territory &apos;s handover to China . 
the territory will start issuing Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) passports after Britain ends 156 years of colonial rule and hands Hong Kong back to China at midnight on June 30 . 
&quot; The Kiribati government has made a very welcome decision in granting visa-free access to holders of Hong Kong SAR passports after July 1 , &quot; Tung said in a statement . 
so far , some 30 countries -- including Britain , Singapore , Canada , and the Philippines -- have promised either visa-free or easy access for holders of the future Hong Kong passports .
