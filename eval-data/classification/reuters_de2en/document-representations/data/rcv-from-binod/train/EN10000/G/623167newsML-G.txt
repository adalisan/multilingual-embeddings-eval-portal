Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has rejected a request by South Africa to release five Zimbabweans jailed for offences linked to an apartheid-era sabotage campaign , the Financial Gazette reported on Thursday . 
Mugabe told the privately owned paper in an interview he had made it clear to his South African counterpart Nelson Mandela during a state visit last week that the prisoners would remain in Zimbabwean custody . 
&quot; We will keep these people in prison until such time that we are satisfied we should release them , if at all we will release them , &quot; Mugabe said . 
Kevin Woods , Philip Conjwayo , Michael Smith and Barry Bawden were jailed for life in 1988 for a spate of bombings at several African National Congress homes in Zimbabwe when South Africa &apos;s now-ruling party was still outlawed . 
another man , Dennis Beaham , was sentenced to 20 years for trying to help them escape prison . 
Mugabe dismissed an assertion by Mandela &apos;s government that the five , granted South African citizenship by the Pretoria government soon after their arrests , should be freed in line with a general amnesty the ANC proclaimed when it assumed power in 1994 . 
&quot; I don &apos;t know how they can become South African citizens because I don &apos;t know whether the South African citizenship can be bestowed by remote control , &quot; Mugabe said . 
&quot; President Mandela did not raise the issue of citizenship with me . 
these are Zimbabweans who violated Zimbabwean laws and people who violate our laws are subject to punishment within the framework of our laws here . 
the families of the five have held protests in South Africa and petitioned the government to help secure their return , saying they had failed to gain access to the Zimbabwean president .
