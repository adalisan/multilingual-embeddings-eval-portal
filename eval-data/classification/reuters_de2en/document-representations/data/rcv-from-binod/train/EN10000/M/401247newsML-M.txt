crude oil prices rebounded Tuesday after oil workers threatened to strike in major exporter Nigeria and sparked worries about a possible interruption of shipments . 
grain , soybean and coffee prices also rose , helping the Knight Ridder commodity Research Bureau Index of 17 commodity futures to close up 1.56 points at 241.62 . 
at the New York Mercantile Exchange , April crude oil ended 29 cents higher at $ 21 per barrel after rising as high as $ 21.31 . 
on Monday , April crude fell 68 cents to $ 20.71 , the lowest level since August . 
buoyed by crude oil &apos;s gains , March heating oil rose 1.35 cents a gallon to 56.82 cents , and March unleaded gasoline gained 1.99 cents a gallon to 62.23 cents . 
workers of Nigeria &apos;s Department of Petroleum Resources , which processes export documents for oil shipments , threatened to go on strike from Friday if they did not receive back pay , oil ministry sources said . 
Nigeria , a member of the Organisation of Petroleum exporting Countries , currently produces about 2.10 million barrels of oil each day and is a key supplier to refineries in the United States , Europe and the Far East . 
many traders , however , downplayed the significance of a possible strike on the market , saying the workers were not responsible for production , so there was no imminent threat to supply . 
but the news was enough to cause speculators to buy back contracts they had sold earlier . 
&quot; The Nigerian news definitely got the ball rolling today but once we got above $ 21 there was a good amount of short covering , &quot; said trader Bob Yawger at E.D. 
&amp; F. Man International . 
prices for crude oil , gasoline and heating oil had fallen steadily this month amid mild weather , adequate stocks and weak demand . 
after the market closed on Tuesday , the American Petroleum Institute said U.S. crude oil stocks rose 516,000 barrels in the week ended Feb . 21 to 305.40 million barrels . 
the rise was smaller than the build of 1 million to 3 million that traders had expected . 
gasoline stocks fell 3.17 million barrels to 203.12 million and stocks of distillate , which include heating oil and diesel , fell 1.62 million barrels to 106.09 million . 
at the Chicago Board of Trade , March soybeans soared 15 cents a bushel on speculative buying to close at $ 7.91 , the highest level since Sept . 27 . 
March soymeal ended up a strong $ 4.90 a ton at $ 261.30 , just off a new life-of-contract high set during the day . 
corn , which had seen the heaviest buying by the professional fund investors in recent days , benefitted again as soybeans rallied . 
March corn ended 4-1 / 4 cents per bushel higher at $ 2.93-1 / 4 . 
&quot; Everyone &apos;s gun shy right now and waiting to see if the funds want to sell , &quot; said analyst Steve Bruce of E.D. 
and F. Man International . 
analysts said the funds appeared to be building positions to catch any price gains that might occur from planting delays , though most analysts are projecting near-record crops for corn and soybeans in the United States this year . 
prices for wheat and corn hit record highs last year on weather problems and worries about tight world stocks . 
March wheat closed 2 cents per bushel higher at $ 3.77 . 
at New York &apos;s Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange , March coffee closed up 0.90 cent per pound at 174.15 cents amid worries about tight supplies . 
Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes said supply woes were rekindled this week after Colombia National Coffee Growers &apos; Federation official John Naranjo said a &quot; drastic drop &quot; in the country &apos;s output justified market fears about tight supply . 
revising previous estimates of Colombia &apos;s production in the 1996 / 97 coffee year , Naranjo said production could drop as low as 10.4 million 132-pound bags , down from 12.9 million bags a year earlier . 
&quot; There is still concern about the Colombian crop being smaller , &quot; Ganes said , adding that some analysts expect Colombia &apos;s crop to fall below 10 million bags . 
Colombia is the world &apos;s second largest grower after Brazil , which is also expected to see a lower crop in 1997 .
