the Australian dollar was trying desperately to put some distance between it and an 18-month low at the midsession , but with scant success so far . 
it delved as deep as US $ 0.7420 overnight , the lowest level since late January last year , as sliding commodity prices spooked investors already worn out by weeks of rate cut rumours . 
traders reported scattered exporter bids around US $ 0.7440 in a broadly short market while a bounce in US $ / yen had seen some losses recouped against the yen . 
but most were planning to sell into any rally should it reach US $ 0.7470 in the expectation of visiting US $ 0.7390 or even 73 cents in this downtrend . 
on the crosses it bounced to 84.30 / 40 yen from Monday &apos;s late 83.66 / 76 , which had been its lowest local close since August last year . 
the rise came courtesy of the Japanese authorities who offered enought verbal support for the ailing US $ / yen to lift it to 113.20 yen from a lowly 112.40 this morning . 
in trade weighted terms it edeged up one basis point to 56.8 .
