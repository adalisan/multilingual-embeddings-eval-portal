Australian bond yields ended way above the day &apos;s lows on Wednesday after the Reserve Bank left policy unchanged after Tuesday &apos;s board meeting and first quarter GDP came roughly within median expectations . 
&quot; The short end weakened a little ... following no announcement from the RBA this morning , after much speculation overnight of a rate cut today , and possibly a little disappointed that Q1 growth was not a little softer , &quot; said Su-Lin Ong , fixed income economist at Hambros Bank Australia . 
the market had built up a head of steam following the policy making meeting , although a further easing in monetary policy was only given an outside chance as the central bank had only eased official rates to 5.5 percent on May 23 . 
however , the market is not totally convinced that a further rate cut is off the agenda this cycle , and September bill futures , while below the day &apos;s high , at a close of 94.62 still equate to a cash rate of 5.38 percent . 
first quarter GDP came in at up 0.9 percent for an annual rate of 2.4 percent , while inflation indicators remained subdued with the GDP-E deflator rising just 0.3 percent . 
&quot; The continued excellent performance of the deflators has left the door open for the RBA to ease if and when they become satisfied their 4.0 percent growth target is out of reach , &quot; said Societe Generale Australia economist Glenn Maguire . 
however , other economists , such as UBS Australia chief economist Stephen Roberts , believe there is sufficient evidence in the data to suggest another rate cut was less likely , noting that every component of domestic final demand rose strongly . 
the market and policy makers will now be scrutinising the monthly indicators such as retail trade , labour force and housing data for clues on monetary policy . 
John Peters , senior economist at Westpac , said today &apos;s data was consistent with the view that the economy will remain subdued over the first half of 1997 before picking up in the second half and into 1998 . 
&quot; ... evidence of continuing soft economic conditions as we move into Q2 , coupled with a still struggling labour market , a very positive 1997 inflation outlook , and ongoing evidence of moderate broad-based wage pressures , we rate another official rate cut in the next three months as 50 / 50 , &quot; Peters added . 
meanwhile , the focus now switches to the U.S. and the run-up to Friday &apos;s key non-farm payrolls for May . 
the local pullback from the day &apos;s highs saw it generally underperform against the dollar bloc . 
the 10-year spread to the U.S. returned to a 70-90 basis point trading range , but still remains close to key resistance at 65 b.p. , and where a break could trigger a contraction to 50 b.p. , analysts said .
