Taiwan officials met on Wednesday to decide whether to let activists fly to a deserted East China Sea archipelago in the latest challenge to Japan &apos;s disputed claim of sovereignty . 
&quot; Officials from related agencies are meeting this afternoon to discuss the issue , &quot; an official at the Civil Aeronautics Administration said by telephone . 
&quot; They should come up with a final decision after the meeting . 
leaders of the private Protect-the-Diaoyus alliance were seeking to rent helicopters to fly on Friday to the uninhabited islands claimed by Japan as the Senkakus and by Taiwan and China as the Diaoyus . 
activists hoped to drop flags of Taiwan &apos;s exiled Republic of China government to commemorate Taiwan &apos;s October 25 retrocession Day -- the day in 1945 on which Japan &apos;s 50-year occupation of Taiwan was brought to an end by Tokyo &apos;s World War Two defeat . 
the aeronautics administration has said the group needed approvals from both Taipei and Tokyo to fly to the Diaoyus since the airspace is jointly controlled by the rival claimants . 
but Taiwan &apos;s foreign ministry , mindful of escalating tensions with Tokyo , has expressed &quot; concern &quot; about the planned protest , the state-funded Central News Agency reported . 
the ministry was urging activists to handle the sovereignty row through &quot; rational and peaceful means &quot; and pledged to hold further talks with Tokyo to resolve the dispute . 
two rounds of Japan-Taiwan talks , unofficial due to their lack of diplomatic ties , have failed to defuse the situation . 
Japan recognises only the Beijing government , Taiwan &apos;s rival . 
on October 7 , Taiwan and Hong Kong activists pierced a Japanese maritime cordon and hoisted flags of the communist People &apos;s Republic of China and the Taiwan republic on the islands . 
Tokyo voiced regret for what it called the illegal landing and vowed to take necessary measures to stop similar actions . 
Japanese rightists have triggered an angry and increasingly nationalistic backlash from ethnic Chinese across Asia after raising Japan &apos;s flag and building a lighthouse on the islands in July to assert Tokyo &apos;s claim . 
Taiwan fishermen complain that Japanese patrol boats have barred them from fishing waters near the islands . 
the Japanese patrols also repulsed earlier attempts to land Taiwan and Hong Kong protesters on the islands , deepening anti-Japanese resentment in Taiwan , Hong Kong , Macau and the communist mainland . 
Japan took the islands as war booty after defeating imperial China in 1895 and refuses to acknowledge that the dispute is open for discussion with China or Taiwan . 
China and Taiwan say the islands have been Chinese territory for centuries and should have been returned after Japan &apos;s defeat in World War Two .
