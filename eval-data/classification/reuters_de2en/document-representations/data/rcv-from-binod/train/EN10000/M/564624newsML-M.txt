the key June 10-year Japanese government bond futures contract ended down by more than a full point on Tuesday , as massive selling was triggered by a surge in Tokyo share prices , traders said . 
the sudden rise in share prices on Tuesday led to speculation that the Bank of Japan may raise interest rates earlier than expected and this weakened sentiment , they said . 
&quot; Earlier , the market had felt the BOJ would raise interest rates no earlier than around September , but now some think rates may be raised in July , after the release of the BOJ &apos;s key &apos; tankan &apos; survey , &quot; a senior trust bank trader said . 
the June ended at 124.42 , down sharply from Friday &apos;s close of 125.50 . 
turnover was 71,694 contracts . 
the market was closed on Monday for a national holiday . 
firmness in share prices may induce investors to unload bonds in favour of stocks , a city bank trader said . 
&quot; The rise in share prices may encourage ( investors such as ) pension funds to reconsider their investment strategy . 
they may choose to refrain from increasing their bond holdings ... and move to buy stocks instead , &quot; the trader said . 
traders said there were rumours that investors had sold cash bonds including JGBs and bank debentures . 
investors are probably anxious to sell medium-term and long-term bonds to hedge against the risk of a further rise in interst rates , said a trader for a major brokerage house . 
although some scattered buying of the 193rd 10-year JGB was detected at around par , or 2.6 percent , investors overall seemed reluctant to buy JGBs , the trust bank trader said . 
concern about a large amount of corporate bond launches may cap JGBs in the near term , the trust bank trader added . 
Nippon Paper Industries Co Ltd &apos;s decision to postpone its planned launch of straight bonds , was unlikely to ease market concerns about a possible over-abundance of straight bond launches , the trader said . 
&quot; The market will probably remain cautious , as the straights will probably be launched once the market recovers somewhat , &quot; he said . 
IBJ Securities Co Ltd and Sakura Securities Co Ltd , which were due to be lead managers for Nippon Paper Industries &apos; straight launches , said on Tuesday that the firm had decided to postpone the launch of 50 billion yen worth of the bonds . 
Nippon Paper Industries had been expected to launch 25 billion yen worth of six-year bonds and another 25 billion yen worth of 10-year bonds as early as Tuesday . 
IBJ Securities had been slated to be lead manager for the 10-year bonds and Sakura Securities for the six-year bonds .
