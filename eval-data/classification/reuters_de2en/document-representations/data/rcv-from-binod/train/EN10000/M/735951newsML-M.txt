U.S. Treasury prices broke out of the session &apos;s narrow trading ranges early Thursday afternoon , advancing to session highs on technical buying . 
in the September T-bond futures contract , stops were hit above Wednesday &apos;s 114-27 session high , pushing the September bond contract up above 115 . 
in the cash market , demand at the long end of the maturity curve was also evident , traders said . 
ten-year notes were up 8 / 32 to 103-13 / 32 , yielding 6.16 percent . 
five-year notes were up 3 / 32 to 100-5 / 32 , yielding 6.07 percent and two-year notes were up 1 / 32 to 100-9 / 32 , yielding 5.84 percent . 
at the short end of the maturity curve , three-month bill rates were up one basis point to 5.06 percent . 
six-month and year-bill rates were unchanged at 5.09 percent and 5.21 percent , respectively . 
analysts said a newswire story that 95 members of the House , including Speaker Newt Gingrich , have signed onto a bill introduced Thursday requiring that future budget surpluses be used to pay down the national debt , was a supportive factor , analysts said . 
&quot; The story fits in with the &quot; no supply &quot; theory talked about since last quarter , &quot; said analysts at Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s mms , referring to the notion that a shrinking U.S. budget deficit would lead to a smaller supply of U.S. government securities . 
in early trade , data on June U.S. housing starts and jobless claims in the week ended July 12 had scant market impact . 
the Labor Department reported that new jobless claims fell to 349,000 in the latest week from 377,000 a week earlier . 
they said the drop was due to the &quot; unwinding &quot; of the temporary impact of seasonal auto plant shutdowns for retooling for next year &apos;s models . 
they said they expect jobless claims levels to be volatile in July and even in early August . 
the government also said U.S. housing starts rose to an annualized 1.45 million in June , up from a revised 1.385 million in May . 
&quot; I would not view today &apos;s numbers as strong , though we had a drop in unemployment claims and a jump in housing starts , &quot; said Michael Moran , chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc . &quot; The claims figures are still distorted by auto plant shutdowns . 
&quot; The housing starts number was also not as strong as it seemed on the surface , &quot; he said . 
Moran said multi-family housing starts moved from the lower end to the upper portion of their monthly range . 
&quot; I would view the housing starts increase more as a matter of a random fluctuation rather than a signal of underlying strength , &quot; he said . 
the Philadelphia Fed survey for July read 28.1 , up from the June reading of 25.2 . 
that was stronger than the market had anticipated and the news dealt prices a small , short-lived setback .
