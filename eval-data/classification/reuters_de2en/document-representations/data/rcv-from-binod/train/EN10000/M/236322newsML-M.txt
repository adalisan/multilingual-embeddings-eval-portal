the Zimbabwe dollar closed on Thursday mixed against hard currencies after a lacklustre interbank session during which most of its movements were directed by overseas market trends , dealers said . 
&quot; It was a very quiet day , nothing much happened , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; It could be that some companies are winding down business for Christmas , &quot; another said . 
the local unit finished the day at 10.7500 / 7700 against the U.S. unit , where it was for most of the day . 
this was however a slight drop from 10.7450 / 7650 overnight . 
against sterling , it climbed to 17.4200 / 4600 from 17.6590 / 7090 , reflecting a stronger U.S. dollar against the British unit overseas , but slipped versus the mark to 6.8950 / 9130 from Wednesday &apos;s 6.8840 / 8995 . 
it was quoted firmer on the rand at 2.2950 / 3030 compared to 2.3025 / 3125 the previous day .
