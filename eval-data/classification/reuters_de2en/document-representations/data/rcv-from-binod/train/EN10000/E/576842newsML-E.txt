British factory-gate prices showed their slowest rate of increase for more than 10 years in April , according to official figures published on Monday , indicating that inflationary pressures remain subdued . 
economists said the weaker-than-expected figures meant the Bank of England , which was last week given freedom to set interest rates by the new Labour government , was unlikely to tighten monetary policy aggressively . 
the Office for National Statistics ( ons ) said the prices of goods leaving factory gates , or output prices , rose 0.2 percent in April from the previous month and were up 0.8 percent from a year earlier . 
&quot; This is the lowest rate of increase since September 1986 , &quot; the ons said of the annual figure . 
input prices , a measure of the cost of raw materials and fuel used by manufacturers , fell a seasonally adjusted 1.9 percent in April and were down 10.5 percent year-on-year , the largest annual fall since November 1986 . 
&quot; These are excellent numbers , providing further evidence of very strong downward pressure on costs at the beginning of the inflation pipeline , &quot; said Jonathan Loynes , an economist at HSBC Markets . 
&quot; With much of this good news still to feed through into the high street , retail price inflation is set to fall further this year even as retailers take advantage of stronger consumer activity to widen their margins . 
Bank of England Governor Eddie George appeared relaxed about the inflation outlook , telling reporters in Basle , Switzerland that the government had a reasonable chance of meeting its target of 2.5 percent or less for underlying annual inflation . 
&quot; There is a better or even chance of 2-1 / 2 percent or less , &quot; George said . 
new Chancellor of the Exchequer ( finance minister ) Gordon Brown astounded financial markets last week by announcing that interest rates , until now set by the Chancellor , would in future be determined by a new monetary policy committee at the Bank . 
Brown also raised official interest rates to 6.25 percent from 6.0 percent . 
the central bank will make known its current thinking in its quarterly inflation report , to be published on Tuesday . 
Michael Saunders , UK economist at Salomon Brothers , said he expected underlying inflation to fall to around 2.0 percent at the end of the year from 2.7 percent in March . 
&quot; The prospect of very low inflation figures late this year will not stop the authorities from raising rates because inflation is likely to edge up again in 1998 as the currency effect wears off , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Nevertheless , low inflation figures , plus extra fiscal restraint , will limit the extent to which rates rise . 
Saunders forecast that official interest rates would peak at around 6.75 percent in the next few months before levelling off . 
the falls in output prices were concentrated mainly in the oil and food sectors . 
these sectors also saw falls on the input price side , encouraged by the strength of sterling which reduced import prices .
