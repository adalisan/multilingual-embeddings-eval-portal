Mexican shares shed early gains and decoupled from Wall Street at mid-morning trade on Wednesday on what traders said was profit-taking triggered by political and social unease on the domestic front . 
&quot; Dealers buying at 3,900 points are betting on our rallying to 4,000 , but I feel political fallout is holding back buyers , &quot; a fund manager said , who asked not to be named . 
the leading IPC share index was down 33.39 points , or 0.85 percent , at 3,897.35 , after reaching an early high of 3,945.79 points , a rise of 15.05 . 
traders meanwhile said the market had turned around on profit-taking . 
&quot; Many wanted the bourse to gain a bit more before stepping in to sell and they took the Dow as a pretext . 
nonetheless , I feel we won &apos;t return to opening levels , but will stay between 3,870-3,900 points , &quot; a floor trader said . 
&quot; They stepped in to sell as soon as they saw the Dow would get no higher , &quot; a desk trader added . 
the Dow Jones was meanwhile up 35.02 points at 7,309.23 , after climbing to an early trading record of 7,351.68 points .
