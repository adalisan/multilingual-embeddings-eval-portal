Polish shares are seen rising next week unless Friday &apos;s U.S. jobless data shows high employment and causes Dow falls due to expected U.S. interest rate rises , analysts said . 
&quot; If today &apos;s information is good and would delay the possibility of an interest rate rise ... I think we could have rises next week , &quot; said Kamil Kalemba , a trader at ING Barings in Warsaw . 
( the U.S. figures , issued shortly afterwards , were close to market forecasts and did little to dispel expectations of further U.S. interest rate rises . 
other analysts played down the influence of the U.S. bourse , saying steep Warsaw falls earlier this week largely represented a deeper correction after the market had risen to a three-year high at 18,339.4 points on February 18 . 
&quot; The market was overheated after rising so much this year , &quot; said Piotr Leszczuk , an analyst at Bank Slaski brokerage . 
the market started this year at 14,342.8 points . 
it fell 6.1 percent this week to 15,670.2 . 
analysts were bullish on the construction sector , which was seen benefiting from this year &apos;s better weather and increased demand , though Tomasz Berent of IB Austria Securities said such factors might already have been priced in . 
they said more information on the earnings fate of builders and other industrials would come on Tuesday in the form of the Central Statistics Office &apos;s March business climate indicator . 
analysts said the main market &apos;s biggest loser this week , debt-ridden builder Espebepe , fell 19 percent as speculators continued to play on the firm &apos;s unclear fate . 
the firm , which has 75 million zlotys in debt and a creditors &apos; meeting due on April 14 , surged 41.9 percent last week after the previous week &apos;s steep fall . 
the only blue chip among the loss leaders , BRE , fell 15.2 percent largely due to its downward mid-week revision of 1996 net profit . 
analysts said Kredyt Bank , which rose three percent on the week and was the main market &apos;s top gainer , should continue to benefit from Friday &apos;s news it had won a tender to buy Polish Investment Bank ( PBI ) and prosper Bank .
