a national commission recommended Wednesday that an independent board be appointed to oversee the Internal Revenue Service and called for simplification of the 9,451-page U.S. tax code . 
leaders of the commission , Sen. Robert Kerrey and Representative Rob Portman , said legislation would be filed in mid-July to enact the recommendations in the report . 
but the Clinton administration quickly served notice it will vigorously oppose the key recommendation for the IRS to be run by a seven-member board , drawn mostly from the private sector , rather than by the Treasury Department . 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin called a news conference to blast the proposal for private-sector oversight as a &quot; substantially and seriously flawed &quot; idea that potentially could disrupt the smooth running of government by interfering with its revenues . 
the IRS collects 95 percent of U.S. tax revenue , mainly in the form of legally imposed tax collections from individuals . 
Rubin praised the commission &apos;s leaders for their effort and emphasised that he considered them well-intentioned , but suggested a potential political motive behind their key recommendation . 
&quot; I do think that in this debate about governance and the IRS there are others who have other agendas , &quot; Rubin said , without naming anyone . 
&quot; I think clearly there is a desire on the part of some to undermine our progressive taxation system and replace it with a different system of taxation and that one approach to trying to do that is to attack the Internal Revenue Service , &quot; he said . 
he said Republicans would press for approval of the recommendations from the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue System . 
among five dozen recommendations from the commission were encouraging more use of electronic tax filing , eliminating the alternative minimum tax and extending the deadline , now April 15 , for filing personal income taxes . 
it also proposed more safeguards for taxpayers including compensation for wrongful IRS acts . 
Kerrey , a Nebraska Democrat , said the overall goal was to make IRS a service-oriented , taxpayer-friendly agency , rather than an impentrable enforcement agency . 
Portman , a Republican of Ohio , said the commission decided an independent board was needed because Treasury did not have enough management expertise or time to manage the agency . 
five of the 17 commissioners opposed the new board . 
House Majority Leader Dick Armey , a Texas Republican , said he might support an independent board but he described the step as &quot; an incidental point to everyone except the Treasury &quot; compared to the goal of tax simplification . 
&quot; Simplify the tax code . 
give folks a manageable job , &quot; he said . 
Kerrey said confidence in the U.S. government would grow if Americans viewed the tax system as fair . 
the presidentially appointed board proposed by the commission would have five members from &quot; large service organisations . 
&quot; Its other members would be the secretary of the Treasury and a representative from the labour union representing IRS workers . 
under the plan , Treasury would retain full control of tax policy .
