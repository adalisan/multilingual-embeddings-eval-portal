U.S. stock index futures finished the day sharply lower , widening losses late after quiet trade much of the day . 
once Treasury bond futures closed , June Standard and Poor &apos;s 500 futures staged a brief short-covering rebound off the day &apos;s lows , then faltered and headed lower . 
June made a fresh low late in the day at 767.50 . 
traders said support still rested at 766.00 and at 760.00 . 
NASDAQ 100 index futures also collapsed late , heading back toward 820.00 support . 
Kansas City Value Line futures slipped to the lowest price in almost two weeks . 
traders said action overall was thin and traders were wary ahead of next week &apos;s hefty data line-up . 
among the data are March new home sales Monday and durable goods Tuesday , with first-quarter employment cost index also due Tuesday . 
national Association of Purchasing Management , gross domestic product and non-farm payrolls are due later in the week . 
traders said data will be the sole drive for price action , as players scrutinize the reports for signs of economic strength . 
the Federal Reserve &apos;s policy arm meets May 20 , and traders said they would be on the lookout for signs the Fed will raise rates again . 
&quot; All in all it was a pretty light day , &quot; the trader said . 
&quot; Once the short-covering rally was over there was really nothing behind it and it failed , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I think we &apos;ve had a big run up and generally some profit-taking in IBM and just some technicals coming back was enough to take it lower , &quot; he said . 
traders noted scant impact from a strong dollar as Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and President Bill Clinton soothed fears tied to the Group of Seven &apos;s meeting Sunday . 
briefing reporters on the G7 meeting , Rubin said late Friday that U.S. policy for a strong dollar remains unchanged and a meeting between Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto showed no apparent friction over Japan &apos;s growing trade surplus with the U.S. 
June Nikkei 225 futures closed slightly higher and in the middle of the overall range . 
traders said action was light overall . 
one trader said a dealer sold 500 to 600 June near midmorning to push the contract to the 18,440 low , thought to be hedge fund activity .
