more than 100 nuns began a two-week retreat on Thursday to select a successor for ailing Mother Teresa , who wants to step down after leading her renowned religious order for nearly half a century . 
a total of 103 nuns from the missionaries of Charity confined themselves within the order &apos;s Calcutta headquarters to pray and meditate ahead of the vote by secret ballot set for February 2 , Roman Catholic church officials said . 
mother Teresa has led the order since she created it in 1948 , shaping the mission &apos;s work in 111 countries with her strong , charismatic personality . 
but the 86-year-old nun has decided to retire as the order &apos;s superior general because of heart , kidney and lung problems which have forced her into hospital emergency care three times since last August . 
&quot; It is God who will now choose my successor , &quot; Mother Teresa told her aides recently . 
&quot; Mother Teresa does not want to continue as superior general because of her poor health and a weak heart , &quot; said a missionaries of Charity spokeswoman . 
the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize winner , known affectionately as &quot; Mother &quot; , wanted to step down in 1990 , one year after she was fitted with a heart pacemaker , because of ill health . 
but her colleagues asked her to stay on . 
a regular six-year election by secret ballot set for last September had to be delayed because Mother Teresa was sent to hospital in August with heart problems , pneumonia and malaria . 
the selection process began on Thursday involving the 103 members of the order &apos;s electoral college , or General Chapter . 
the college is comprised of representatives from various sections of the order , which has about 4,500 nuns . 
the retreat was being held at the order &apos;s headquarters , Mother &apos;s House , for the first time to allow Mother Teresa to participate . 
set to end on January 31 , the retreat was to be followed by several meetings of the General Chapter before the election by secret ballot on February 2 . 
nuns were reluctant to speak about the possibility of Mother Teresa being replaced , and some have privately said they would like her to stay on . 
speculation about a successor has focused on a handful of senior nuns . 
Maltese-born Sister Frederica , in her 60s , is the current assistant general , or second-in-charge . 
she was a former regional supervisor of the order in the United States . 
in 1990 , she replaced Sister Agnes Das , a Bengali nun and Mother Teresa &apos;s first disciple in the charity . 
mother Teresa has described Sister Agnes as her &quot; second self &quot; . 
in 1990 , when Mother Teresa wanted to step down , Agnes withdrew from the electoral scene on medical grounds . 
newspapers have said a potential superior general appeared to be Hindu-born Sister Nirmala , who heads the order &apos;s contemplative wing of &quot; elite &quot; nuns . 
mother Teresa underwent life-saving surgery on November 29 to unblock two coronary arteries , her third such operation since 1991 . 
while recovering in hospital , she developed kidney and lung problems . 
the doctors had to reprogramme her pacemaker and give her mild electric shocks to correct an irregular heart beat . 
&quot; She is still in the high risk zone with heart , kidney and lung problems and any infection at this stage can be fatal , &quot; said Dr Tarun Praharaj , member of a team of doctors which treated Mother Teresa at a Calcutta hospital .
