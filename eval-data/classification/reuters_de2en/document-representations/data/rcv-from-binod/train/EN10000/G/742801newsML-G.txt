honoured with top naval brass on board and a modern U.S. Navy vessel at each side , the 200-year-old USS Constitution sailed under its own power for the first time in more than a century on Monday . 
the refitted Constitution , nicknamed &quot; Old Ironsides &quot; after its victory over a British warship during the War of 1812 , cruised under six sails through the familiar waters of Massachusetts Bay for about an hour before tugboats towed it into Marblehead Harbour . 
during the 65-minute sail under cloudy skies , the Constitution reached a top speed of 4 knots , or 5 mph ( 8 kph ) , in winds of 7 knots , or 8.5 mph ( 13.7 kph ) , and sailed 3.5 nautical miles , or 4.1 miles ( 6.6 km ) . 
while the Blue angels , the Navy &apos;s jet-aircraft acrobatic team , flew overhead , the destroyer USS Ramage and the frigate USS Halyburton cruised alongside Constitution and their crews rendered honours with a salute . 
&quot; I have never seen an event like this , &quot; said Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jay Johnson , who rode along on the historic voyage . 
&quot; It &apos;s a great linkage back to our maritime history . 
Johnson said the Navy has yet to decide whether the ship will sail again , but said , &quot; she &apos;ll be a tremendous focal point of pride for the U.S. Navy and for the whole country as we push our way into the next century . 
the deck of the ship was crowded with dignitaries and news reporters . 
nearby , hundreds of sail and power pleasure boats followed the Constitution and helicopters circled overhead . 
thousands more people watched from shore . 
Secretary of the Navy John Dalton and other top officials from the Navy and the marines took turns steering the ship . 
former CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite , who donated some of his spare change as a schoolchild in the 1920s to the Constitution &apos;s restoration , also took a turn . 
the reception was far greater than in 1934 when the Constitution was towed to San Diego , California , and back , said Hosiah Towery , 87 , who served on the Consititution for six months on that cruise . 
&quot; I swear there weren &apos;t enough people on the dock to tie her up , &quot; when the Constitution arrived back in Boston in 1934 , he said . 
Monday &apos;s short voyage was a far cry from the Constitution &apos;s days of fighting the British off the coast of a young nation or Barbary pirates off the &quot; shores of Tripoli . 
&quot; But it capped a 44-month , $ 12 million restoration and months of training by its crew . 
Michael Beck , captain of the Constitution who will leave the Navy on Saturday to become a schoolteacher . 
&quot; America is still a place where we can do hard things . 
the 44-gun frigate earned the nickname when cannon balls fired from the British warship HMS Guerriere bounced off its thick oak hull during an August 1812 confrontation in the Atlantic . 
old Ironsides defeated the Guerriere , the first time America &apos;s tiny navy had beaten a British ship . 
in October 1881 , the Constitution , growing obsolete with the advent of steam-driven ships , sailed for the last time to New London , Connecticut , from Newport , Rhode Island , as part of a training mission . 
before Monday , a black-and-white photograph taken by a soldier at Fortress Monroe , Virginia , in the summer of 1881 was the only known picture of the Constitution under sail . 
as Ironsides entered the Marblehead Harbour on Monday , the ship fired a 21-gun salute to Fort Sewall , which responded with a single cannon shot . 
the solo shot echoed an episode from the War of 1812 , when the Constitution , pursued for three days by two larger British ships , took cover in the Marblehead harbour near the fort . 
the fort was armed with only a single cannonball and a handful of rocks . 
but its soldiers waited until the two British ships were within sight , shot the cannonball , and scared the British off . 
navy officers were talking already about the Constitution &apos;s next trip . 
some said the ship may sail again on the 200th anniversary of its launch in Boston in October . 
former Constitution Commander Robert Gillen , head of the &quot; pennies Campaign &quot; to raise funds to buy more sails for Ironsides , said the ship may be almost as strong as it was during its heyday . 
nevertheless , the Constitution is far too important to take far from its port in Boston . 
&quot; The ship is not fitted for open ocean sailing . 
why take that chance , &quot; he said in a recent interview . 
&quot; I am afraid some people may misconstrue what the limitation of this grand old ship is .
