the U.S. Federal Reserve decided on Wednesday to hold interest rates steady . 
the central bank &apos;s decision , disclosed after a two-day meeting in Washington , had been widely expected . 
it left the key federal funds rate that commercial banks charge each other for overnight loans unchanged at 5.25 percent and the discount rate that the Fed charges banks for money at 5 percent . 
&quot; The Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended at 11 : 35 a.m. ( 1635 GMT ) , &quot; central bank spokesman Joseph Coyne said . 
&quot; There is no further announcement . 
with inflation tame and , by at least one measure , at a 30-year low , the U.S. central bank had scant justification for raising short-term interest rates now , economists said . 
many believe it is only a matter of time before the Fed tightens credit , however . 
with the job market taut and wages picking up , the Fed will eventually need to raise rates a notch if it wants to keep inflation in check , they said . 
the next meeting of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee is on March 25 . 
but it could conceivably raise rates before then if economic conditions warranted such a move . 
the Fed has held rates steady for over a year , since cutting them by a quarter percentage point on Jan . 31 , 1996 . 
Central bank Chairman Alan Greenspan told state governors on Sunday he saw no evidence of significant price pressures in the economy , Iowa Gov. 
Terry Branstad said . 
&quot; He gave a positive report . 
we &apos;ve had growth with low inflation , &quot; Branstad told reporters after the governors &apos; closed-door meeting with the Fed chief . 
the economy ended 1996 with a bang , growing at a 4.7 percent annualized rate in the final three months of the year . 
that was more than double the pace of the previous quarter and the fastest rate of growth in 2-1 / 2 years . 
but inflation remained benign . 
the implicit price deflator that measures price changes rose at a mere 1.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter , the slowest pace since 1967 . 
in a sign that the economy may be about to slow down from its torrid fourth quarter pace , the government reported on Wednesday that factory orders ended 1996 on a weak note , falling by 1.3 percent in December . 
&quot; The economy has retained considerable vigor , with few signs of the imbalances and inflationary tensions that have disrupted past expansions , &quot; Greenspan said last month . 
but he also warned lawmakers of the risk of future higher inflation and said the Fed had to be ready to act to contain price pressures once they started to show signs of building . 
besides plotting interest rate strategy at their two-day meeting , Fed policymakers also discussed their projections for economic growth , inflation and unemployment this year for presentation by Greenspan to Congress later this month . 
several Fed policymakers have already said publicly that they expect moderate economic growth this year in the two to 2-1 / 2 percent range . 
on a fourth quarter on fourth quarter basis , the economy grew by 3.4 percent last year . 
but Chris Varvares , President of macroeconomic Advisers of St. Louis , said there is a risk that inflation will pick up this year even if growth moderates because the economy is already running at such high level of capacity . 
that eventually may prove enough to convince the Fed to take out some &quot; monetary insurance &quot; and raise rates a notch . 
but that will not happen until it can get a better reading of where the economy -- and inflation -- are headed , he said .
