Andy Pettitte pitched 6-2 / 3 innings to win his fourth straight start , and the New York Yankees scored three times in the first and ninth innings in a 7-3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Monday . 
Pettitte ( 12-5 ) allowed nine hits , walked one and struck out three . 
new York jumped on starter Bryce Florie for three runs in the first inning . 
&quot; Obviously you take runs whenever you get them , but I &apos;m not really crazy about getting them early , &quot; Pettitte said . 
&quot; I just as soon go out there and settle in , see what I &apos;ve got and get going and see what kind of pace we &apos;ve got going because I go out there when we get the early lead and I get ( in ) my mentality -- Okay just make sure you throw strikes . 
but you start thinking a little bit and you start falling behind people and I was falling behind guys early today , &quot; Pettitte said . 
the Yankees have scored at least one run in the first inning in six straight games . 
in Cleveland , Steve Avery pitched 7-2 / 3 innings for his third win over the Indians this season and Shane Mack and Reggie Jefferson each drove in a run , leading the Boston Red SOx to their fifth win in six games , 3-1 over Cleveland . 
Avery ( 4-2 ) , who beat the Indians in back-to-back starts in April , held them hitless for the first five innings before Julio Franco &apos;s leadoff single in the sixth . 
&quot; I had better stuff , my fastball was good , my changeup had a lot of movement on it , &quot; Avery said . 
in Detroit , Wilson Alvarez allowed three hits over 7-1 / 3 innings and Frank Thomas hit a two-run Homer as the Chicago White SOx blanked the Detroit Tigers , 3-0 . 
Alvarez ( 9-7 ) , who has won five of his last six decisions , walked two and struck out nine . 
Roberto Hernandez struck out the side in the ninth for his 25th save . 
&quot; That was the first time I &apos;ve thrown this many changeups , &quot; Alvarez said . 
&quot; But in this ballpark you have to with the short lines . 
at Texas , Jimmy Key allowed one run over six innings and Rafael Palmeiro belted a two-run Homer in the sixth , leading the Baltimore Orioles to a 5-1 victory over the Texas Rangers . 
key ( 13-6 ) won for the second time in seven starts and became the fourth 13-game winner in the American League . 
he gave up six hits , walked one and struck out seven in his second victory over Texas this season . 
Palmeiro was asked if it &apos;s still special to beat his former team . 
&quot; It &apos;s the same as beating everyone else , it &apos;s not special anymore . 
the Orioles won for the fourth time in 14 games , and the Rangers have dropped six of eight .
