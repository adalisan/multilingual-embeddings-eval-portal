a drop in retail sales in November surprised many analysts looking for a mild gain for the month , but the data does not sound the death-knell for holiday spending , economists said . 
despite weakness in autos , durable goods and apparel , some economists noted numerous signs of latent holiday spending since the later than usual thanksgiving holiday . 
&quot; My guess is for the unexpected weakness that we see in November to be offset by strength in December , &quot; said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. 
Johnson added , &quot; It &apos;s very hard to reconcile the overall number , which is seasonally adjusted , with the ( stronger ) reports that we &apos;ve been getting after thanksgiving . 
he also pointed to technical adjustments that take place near year end that tend to create unexpected swings . 
retail sales were down a surprising 0.4 percent in November off a 0.2 percent rise in October , the U.S. Commerce Department reported . 
excluding a 2.6 percent drop in autos , retail sales were near expectations at up 0.3 percent . 
economists surveyed by Reuters forecasted retail sales rose 0.3 percent in November , and by 0.2 percent less autos . 
economists noted strength outside retail sales data was evidenced by a 1.0 percent rise in the BTM / Schroders weekly chain store sales index and a 0.8 percent rise in Johnson Redbook , both for the first week of December . 
indeed , James Glassman , senior economist at Chase Securities Inc , said spending did not pick up as many had hoped , but that he would look to December for a better read . 
&quot; The problem is that most people by the end of the day are going to say Christmas sales aren &apos;t over until Christmas is over , &quot; Glassman said . 
Kevin Flanagan , vice president and market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds noted discounting by retailers was a likely culprit behind the unexpected drop . 
chain store and auto sales reported last week were not indicative of the weakness displayed in the overall number , he added . 
taking a broader perspective economists said the data maintains that the economy is growing faster than in Q3 . 
but First Albany &apos;s Johnson said that is still slow and confirms the notion of a &quot; no boom , no bust &quot; scenario . 
Johnson added that the numbers reflect 2.0 percent to 2.5 percent gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter . 
David Orr , chief capital markets economist at First Union Corp , said seasonal factors implied by the late thanksgiving put November data in question . 
taken together with October and excluding auto sales , Orr noted retail sales were up a &quot; decent , not overly troublesome &quot; 5.5 percent . 
the larger than expected overall drop in November could give cause for a shift in expectations over Federal Reserve monetary policy from a tightening to an easing bias , Orr said . 
Fixed-income markets added to overnight gains following the retail sales data and the simultaneous release of in-line consumer price data . 
the CPI rose 0.3 percent in November and by 0.2 percent excluding volatile food and energy components , according to the U.S. Labor Department . 
Johnson said the market &apos;s strength before the U.S. open tamed the reaction to the statistics .
