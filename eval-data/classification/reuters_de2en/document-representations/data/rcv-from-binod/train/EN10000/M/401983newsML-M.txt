strategists at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett raised their year-end forecast for the FTSE 100 index as part of a broad review of forecasts prompted by an increasingly negative view on the mark , market sources said on Wednesday . 
the brokerage &apos;s still-cautious view on the FTSE is that it will end the year at 4,000 , up slightly from its previous 3,900 forecast but still well below the index &apos;s current near-record level above the 4,300 point . 
sources said Hoare Govett had cut its 1997 forecast for the mark to $ 1.75 from $ 1.60 , arguing that only further weakness in the German currency will lift growth and allow Germany to meet Maastrict debt criteria . 
expectations of low continued mark weakness -- and consequent relative sterling strength -- were enough to trim half a percentage point off Hoare Govett &apos;s forecast for UK GDP growth this year . 
the brokerage also cut half a point off its UK inflation forecast and a quarter point off its year-end UK interest rate forecast to 6-1 / 2 percent , sources said , sligthly improving the appeal of equities here . 
strategists at the brokerage declined comment .
