a small group of nationals of the Central African Republic took over their country &apos;s embassy in Paris for several hours on Monday to protest against French military intervention in Bangui . 
the occupiers , numbering about 15 , were ejected from the building by French police at the request of the Central African ambassador after they had been in the embassy for four hours . 
no arrests or injuries were reported . 
&quot; We will continue our action in the days ahead , &quot; said Henri Grothe , who identified himself as spokesman for the Action Committee for Peace in Central Africa . 
Grothe &apos;s group carried out a peaceful day-long occupation of the embassy a month ago for the same reasons . 
the group demanded that France withdraw its troops from Bangui where there was a weekend of bloody clashes between army mutineers and French forces who launched helicopter-led raids to avenge the killing of two French officers . 
at least 10 mutineers were killed . 
the foreign ministry in Paris said on Monday that the mission of French troops in Bangui was to &quot; ensure the stability of the Central African Republic and consolidate the democratic process &quot; . 
a ministry spokesman said France &quot; had reacted to prevent the situation from degenerating &quot; and had taken photographs of the men who shot dead a French captain and a senior warrant officer , kicking off the crisis . 
the two unarmed French soldiers were accompanying a mediating mission of African officers when they were attacked and shot dead , the ministry said .
