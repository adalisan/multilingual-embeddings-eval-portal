Australian debt futures eased slightly after the Reserve Bank made no announcement on policy , a move some had expected in the light of this week &apos;s data 
September bill futures touched a low of 94.94 shortly after 9.30 a.m. ( 2330 GMT ) when policy announcements are usually made , although even at this level it still equates to a cash rate of 5.06 percent compared to official 5.5 percent interest rates . 
I suspect they are maybe doing some fine tuning on timing , or perhaps just to have the authority of a very recent board meeting behind the decision , &quot; said David Lansley , senior econmist at NAB . 
this week &apos;s benign outcomes on inflation and wages are seen justifying a rate cut given the economy has yet to see all sectors growing in tandem and with unemployment still high . 
ten-year bond futures also softened after Thursday &apos;s rally to an all-ime high of 93.640 , and while some analysts see room for the rally to continue a bit further , others see this as the very last stage of a near 200 basis point move since April . 
&quot; This is about as good as it gets and we are advising clients to that effect , and it &apos;s a market you might want to start selling and take some profits , &quot; NAB &apos;s Lansley added . 
the market unwound some of Thursday &apos;s spread tightening to the dollar bloc . 
the Australian / U.S. 
10-year bond yield spread made a strong test of 25 basis points on Thursday , its lowest level since the early 1980s . 
new Zealand bonds continue to strengthen with the N.Z.
