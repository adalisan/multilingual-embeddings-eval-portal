Romania &apos;s ex-president Ion Iliescu won re-election as head of his leftist opposition party on Saturday , shrugging off calls for an overhaul of the party after a crushing election defeat by centrists last year . 
several moderates resigned in protest at the end of the two-day conference of the Party of Social Democracy ( PDSR ) after delegates voted overwhelmingly to confirm Iliescu , an ex-communist , as party president . 
the dissidents &apos; group was led by Teodor Melescanu , a former foreign minister and party spokesman , and included two others who were previously top Iliescu aides -- his campaign manager Iosif Boda and Mircea Cosea , a former reform minister . 
they had urged Iliescu to dump associates tainted by corruption scandals in order to revive the party &apos;s fortunes , which sagged after defeat in last November &apos;s parliamentary and presidential elections ended a seven-year grip on power . 
&quot; There can be no dialogue inside the PDSR , &quot; Melescanu told reproters after handing in his resignation late on Saturday . 
&quot; We had called for a radical overhaul to turn the PDSR into a modern party , similar to Britain &apos;s Labour Party . 
the PSDR is dominated by former communists around Iliescu , who swept to power during the 1989 revolution in which Stalinist ruler Nicolae Ceausescu was ousted and shot . 
Iliescu dismissed the dissidents &apos; calls for reforms as &quot; elitist &quot; . 
he said the party had emerged stronger after its two-day conference , during which it patched up rifts with hardline nationalists , its former partners in the left-led coalition which ruled Romania until 1996 . 
&quot; Romania &apos;s future is the nationalist left , &quot; Greater Romania party leader Corneliu Vadim Tudor said , drawing cheers from PDSR conference delegates . 
the PDSR has 23 percent of the seats in parliament , which is dominated by centrists and where nationalists are a small minority . 
latest opinion surveys show Emil Constantinescu , who defeated Iliescu in a presidential election last November , leading in popularity ratings with 67 percent against Iliescu &apos;s 32 percent . 
the surveys show continued popular support for the ruling centrist coalition despite the government &apos;s painful reforms , aimed at putting the economy on a solid market footing . 
thousands of Jiu Valley miners , Romania &apos;s most miliant , on Friday ended a 10-day strike which had posed the biggest challenge to the centrists since they won last year &apos;s election . 
the government said pay concessions made to the miners were pegged on restructuring policies in the mining sector , and would not punch a hole in the country &apos;s austerity budget .
