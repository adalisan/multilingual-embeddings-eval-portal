Britain &apos;s FTSE 100 share index weakened on Wednesday for the third straight session , laid low by a cocktail of interest rate worries , a declining Dow , weak futures and nerves ahead of the new government &apos;s July 2 Budget . 
the leading share index managed to haul itself up from its day &apos;s lows in afternoon trade as the Dow pared its losses , but still closed 25.2 points lower at 4,657.0 ( corrects from 4,657.2 ) . 
it has dropped 125 points this week since reaching a record closing high on Friday . 
&quot; It &apos;s been a recipe for gloom , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; The interest rate situation certainly doesn &apos;t look supportive and the Budget is casting a shadow over the market . 
British retail sales figures for May gave the market an early shock , showing a monthly rise of 1.1 percent compared with forecasts of a 0.2 percent increase . 
analysts said an interest rate rise was now likely next month . 
&quot; There is no doubt that these are astonishingly strong data , even taking away the erratic monthly figures , &quot; said Stephen Hannah , director of research at IBJ International . 
&quot; There can be no shadow of a doubt that we &apos;re looking at another monetary tightening in the next month . 
Minutes from the May monetary meeting fuelled the rate hike fears , with the Bank of England continuing to warn on inflation . 
dealers said the market was still subdued by reports on Monday that the government &apos;s July 2 Budget would abolish tax credit on dividend payments for pension funds . 
&quot; People are using every excuse to do nothing today and the futures have been a big technical downer , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; We &apos;ve got the Budget and more worries about interest rates , we &apos;ll probably see people sitting on their hands until July . 
&quot; declining stocks outnumbered gainers by four to one . 
the biggest loser in the FTSE was British Sky Broadcasting Group plc , knocked 45p lower to 521-1 / 2 after the Financial Times said the Independent Television Commission ( ITC ) watchdog body would tell Sky to pull out of a digital television consortium . 
the report proved positive for Carlton Communications plc , another member , along with Granada Group plc , of the consortium bidding for a UK digital television licence . 
analysts said Carlton could end up in the driving seat if Sky was pushed out and added that the report suggested the ITC would give the consortium the licence if Sky dropped out . 
Carlton shares ended 10-1 / 2p higher at 520-1 / 2 , but Granada , which has a 10.8-percent stake in BSkyB , fared less well . 
its shares dropped 8-1 / 2p to 852-1 / 2 . 
BTR plc was the FTSE &apos;s best performer , continuing to rebound from last week &apos;s lows as buyers decided the stock &apos;s recent fall had been overdone . 
it climbed 8-1 / 2p to 202-1 / 2 . 
LASMO plc was squeezed higher as a spurt of buying caught the market short of stock . 
it gained 8-1 / 2p to 269-1 / 2 . 
BG plc shares survived an early scare when the Monopolies and Mergers Commission told it to trim charges to gas suppliers . 
BG said the new pricing regime had prompted it to adopt new accounting principles which might result in a smaller dividend cut than anticipated earlier this year . 
cheered by this news , the shares gained six pence to 218 . 
the market also learned that a new metals giant would be joining Britain &apos;s blue chips . 
South Africa &apos;s Gencor Ltd said it would list its base metals arm Billiton plc in London , to raise more than $ 1 billion .
