Peru &apos;s President Alberto Fujimori said on Thursday the government and Marxist rebels holding 72 hostages were making progress toward ending the 100-day crisis but there were still problems to overcome . 
the men held at the Japanese ambassador &apos;s home are set to spend Easter under the gun , but the final negotiating phase seems likely to start early next week . 
&quot; Even though , naturally , difficulties still exist , we are getting closer , &quot; Fujimori told local television station Panamericana . 
the president boosted growing optimism in Lima that a solution to the siege was in sight . 
he said he was confident the energetic work of the talks &apos; guarantors , hammering out a deal acceptable to both sides , &quot; is going to bear fruit . 
a Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) military leader in Peru &apos;s central jungle agreed the sides were getting closer but said the government still had to come up with a viable offer to meet their demand for the freedom of jailed comrades . 
&quot; The sides are getting closer but the main demand for the release of prisoners still has to be addressed , &quot; Comrade Alejandro told Reuters from the jungle . 
he did not elaborate . 
in a four-point statement read by the hostage-takers &apos; second-in-command inside the residence , Rolly Rojas , the MRTA said a &quot; peaceful solution for the crisis is in the government &apos;s hands and will come about if they address our demands . 
in a radio interview with Reuters , the rebel negotiator also dismissed as &quot; pure speculation &quot; local media reports detailing a deal purportedly made by the two sides . 
the MRTA originally demanded freedom for up to 450 prisoners but spokesmen have said the group was willing to negotiate a reduced number if the freed comrades were high-ranking fighters . 
an MRTA international spokeswoman , however , hinted the group would also accept the release of ill prisoners . 
&quot; Now it &apos;s the turn for the government to show its good faith by releasing the sick prisoners . 
that would signal a positive turn in negotiations , &quot; Norma Velazco said in an interview published on the MRTA &apos;s Internet web site . 
meanwhile , police said they quelled a riot at a maximum security jail in the Lima outskirts housing leftist rebels and common criminals . 
police and Castro Castro prison spokesmen called it a minor incident which erupted when relatives of inmates were denied special visiting hours for Easter . 
relatives said they were worried about rumours that several people had been injured and were being denied information by the police . 
local residents told reporters they heard machine-gun fire . 
but the police said no one was injured and did not confirm that MRTA members took part in the riots . 
Fujimori has consistently rejected the release of any MRTA member , but speculation has been rife in diplomatic and media circles that he was ready to free some low-ranking members . 
this issue was likely to be the most contentious point when talks resume . 
there is no date for a resumption of talks -- on hold since March 12 -- but the face-to-face meeting was expected to take place on Monday or Tuesday . 
&quot; We hope that very soon the government &apos;s representative ... can hold a meeting , &quot; Fujimori said . 
&quot; We have concluded the stage of preliminary conversations and , even if we have not yet started the final conversations , we have an interval for reflection . 
Easter is just right for that . 
one part of a deal to end Latin America &apos;s longest hostage siege appears to be set -- asylum in Cuba for the rebels . 
diplomats say the hostage-takers have accepted Havana &apos;s offer of safe haven and MRTA international spokesman Isaac Velazco said this week they would take asylum as part of a deal that included the freeing of some jailed comrades . 
as the rebels and government moved closer together , Fujimori hinted he still had some differences with Tokyo on how to end the crisis , despite a 50-minute telephone conversation on Wednesday with Japan &apos;s Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto . 
&quot; Perhaps we live the situation here more intimately . 
in Japan ... there is a distance that does not allow a precise perception of what is going on and what might happen , &quot; he said .
