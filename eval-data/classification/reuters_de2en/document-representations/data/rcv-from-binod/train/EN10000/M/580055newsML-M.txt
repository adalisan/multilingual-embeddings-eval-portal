the price of coffee soared to the highest levels in nearly 2-1 / 2-years Tuesday , and it could reach an all time high because of a supply crunch . 
on New York &apos;s Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange , the May coffee futures contract jumped 10.35 cents to $ 2.56 a pound , a level unseen since July of 1994 . 
coffee drinkers were bracing for a costlier morning brew , after the brokerage house Merrill Lynch said prices could reach record highs prior to the arrival of the next crop , which is expected to this autumn . 
the record price on the New York market was $ 3.40 a pound set on April 14 , 1977 . 
prices on the New York coffee futures market , a forerunner of things to come at the retail level , have nearly doubled since the start of the year due to concern about low inventories and tight Latin American supplies . 
the fast-paced rise has triggered retail price increases as coffee roasters rushed to offset the escalating cost of buying in the futures market . 
in late April , Maxwell House Coffee Co . , a unit of Philip Morris COS . Inc . , and Folgers Coffee Co . , a division of Procter &amp; Gamble , announced increases in coffee prices , boosting the retail price tag on a 13-ounce can by 20 cents to $ 3.06 . 
coffee &apos;s run-up reflects tight supply from Central and South America and low U.S. and European inventories . 
analysts said supplies might only be at comfortable levels again in a year &apos;s time if the weather is favourable and there is no frost damage in powerhouse producer , Brazil as it enters its winter . 
two severe frosts in 1994 , one in June and another in July , damaged the Brazilian crop and sent world prices skyrocketing . 
&quot; Traders have no stocks to speak of and silos are empty , &quot; said Thomas Gehring at the German roaster firm , Kraft Jacobs Suchard . 
bullish sentiment was re-ignited by a report by Merrill Lynch this week that coffee could reach record highs ahead of new crop shipments this autumn . 
&quot; There seems to be nothing to stand in the way of record high prices being attained until the new crop mild coffee becomes available next season since both producer and consumer stocks are at low levels and current prices are not sufficient to curb demand , &quot; said Judith Ganes , an analyst at Merrill Lynch .
