the dollar surged to hit a key resistance point of 118.50 yen in Tokyo trade on Wednesday , its highest level since March 1993 . 
it had earlier surged to a new 31-month high against the mark . 
bids appeared to have emerged in an effort to trigger stop-loss buying orders lying in wait near 118.30 yen , with short-covering from 118.40 yen by dealers who had sold earlier in the day also helping to lift the greenback , a dealer said . 
dealers said that having topped the key technical point of 118.50 yen , the greenback was likely to head towards 120 yen .
