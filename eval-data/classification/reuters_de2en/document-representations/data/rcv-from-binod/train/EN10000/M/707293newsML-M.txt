Hungary &apos;s BUX share index opened at a record 7,168.36 forints on Friday on the back of a rally in chemical heavyweights and OTP Bank , traders said . 
&quot; It was obvious that the rally would continue ( in Budapest ) and everybody wanted to buy &quot; . 
James Oates , director for central and eastern Europe at UBS in London , said Hungary &apos;s safe haven position in the region is behind the rise , meanwhile the amount of funds reaching the Budapest market was not that much . 
&quot; People still regard Hungary as a safe haven and I think probably this may be the case until after the Polish elections , &quot; Oates said . 
&quot; It &apos;s not so much enermous enthusiasm about Hungary rather it &apos;s more lack of enthusiasm for anywhere else . 
Polish parliamentary elections are due on September 21 . 
however , Raiffeisen &apos; Berecz expected the market to retreat somewhat by the end of the day . 
&quot; There never was such a high rise within one day , &quot; he said .
