the New Zealand dollar closed slightly firmer on Tuesday after a short squeeze lifted it from morning lows . 
the kiwi closed at US $ 0.7028 / 35 and 68.93 on its Trade-Weighted Index , up from 0.7024 / 31 and 68.96 at the opening . 
dealers said selling from a local bank pushed the currency down to the low 70s in morning trade . 
&quot; It got down there and everyone got themselves quite bearish , but there were actually quite a few bids between 0.7005 and 0.7010 ... It was just a classic short squeeze at that stage , &quot; a Wellington dealer said . 
he said a small rally in the Aussie and a weaker U.S. dollar were also factors behind the kiwi &apos;s bounce . 
buying was sourced both locally and from offshore , but the market shrugged off comments from both Treasurer Winston Peters and Finance Minister Bill birch at an Auckland investment conference , where both were seen as restating familiar views . 
Peters said looser monetary policy was not the answer to pressure on exporters from the high-flying New Zealand dollar . 
any temporary relief would be eroded by rising costs , he said . 
while birch acknowledged a tension between public pressure to spend more money and the need to control inflation , both he and Peters stressed the government would not spend recklessly . 
one dealer said he saw the currency in a 0.7000-40 range but the topside could be vulnerable overnight . 
no major moves were expected before Thursday &apos;s economic projections from the Reserve Bank .
