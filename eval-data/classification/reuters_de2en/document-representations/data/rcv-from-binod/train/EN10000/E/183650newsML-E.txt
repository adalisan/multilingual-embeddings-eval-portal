investors are starting to warm to Latin America &apos;s most flamboyant leader , taking the planned austerity policies of Ecuador &apos;s new president seriously and scenting hot profits to come . 
Ecuador is bracing itself for the three-times delayed launch of a fiscal austerity package , the impact of which will be cushioned with social measures similar to Venezuela &apos;s approach this year . 
the country &apos;s exuberantly populist president Abdala Bucaram has starred in a rock concert and shaved off his Charlie Chaplin moustache on TV since taking office in August . 
but he has also backed an Argentine-style currency convertibility plan after taking on its architect , Argentina &apos;s former economy minister Domingo Cavallo , as an adviser . 
fixed income investors in particular , abashed by the presidential antics but cheered by the budget presented at the end of October , are anticipating profits in the months ahead . 
&quot; With the 1997 budget in line with expectations , we are growing more comfortable with the orientation of the Bucaram administration , &quot; ING Barings said in a research note . 
&quot; Should the tone of country news become increasingly positive , Ecuador Bradys could outperform . 
we favour PDIs ( Past Due Interest Brady bonds ) , &quot; it added . 
Brady bonds consist of commerical debt restructured after the 1890s debt crisis and now traded on the secondary market . 
Ingrid Iverson , Latin America economist at UBS Securities in New York , said she favoured Ecuador &apos;s Discount bonds over PDIs . 
spreads of the country &apos;s Brady bonds , which are well above those of Latin America &apos;s big four debtors ( Argentina , Brazil , Mexico and Venezuela ) , should narrow when the plan is launched , she added . 
&quot; We believe that with the removal of some of the uncertainty over the direction of economic policy that this spread can narrow and that over the next three months Ecuador &apos;s Bradys have the capacity to outperform the market . 
new York &apos;s Santander Investment has also posted a bullish outlook and foresees Ecuadorean debt outperforming over the next six months . 
&quot; Although the prospect of successfully completing all of the economic and structural proposals in the short term is unlikely , the administration is definitely heading in the right direction , &quot; analyst Siobhan Manning said in a note to investors . 
foreign investors appear largely unruffled by the delayed release of the economic plan , postponed for the third time late on Friday until November 24 . 
it is expected to entail tax and monetary legislation , and moves to give greater autonomy to the central bank and prevent political appointments to the country &apos;s monetary board . 
but not all investors are convinced of Quito &apos;s need for an inflation-fighting convertibility plan , given the rigidities implied for the rest of the economy in fixing the currency at par to the dollar . 
&quot; It &apos;s probably not all that necessary in Ecuador because inflation isn &apos;t all that high -- it is only about 25 percent compared with Bulgaria which is heading towards hyperinflation , &quot; said Peter West , economic advisor at West Merchant Bank in London . 
Bulgaria is also weighing a fixed exchange rate plan . 
UBS &apos;s Iverson agreed that Ecuador &apos;s economic imbalances were not large , its inflation was nowhere near hyperinflationary levels and the Sucre currency , while weak , was not about to collapse . 
&quot; We do not believe that convertibility is either necessary or advisable for Ecuador , &quot; she said . 
&quot; The experience of Argentina has shown that there is a real cost to maintaining a fixed exchange rate -- one worth paying in the case of Argentina but not , we argue , in Ecuador . 
but despite these reservations the plan will be seen as positive by the market , she said , not least because it will require the authorities to balance the public sector accounts .
