Bulgaria &apos;s parliament on Saturday passed an austere budget for calendar 1997 , clearing the last hurdle before introducing an IMF-prescribed currency board system on July 1 . 
&quot; Bulgaria now has an approved 1997 budget , the country &apos;s financial constitution , &quot; Finance Minister Muravei Radev told the assembly . 
&quot; The budget is tailored to the operation of the currency board . 
we have to learn to spend no more than we earn , &quot; the head of parliament &apos;s budget and finance committee , Yordan Tsonev , told reporters . 
the basis of the currency board , which Bulgaria is due to launch next week under an agreement with the International Monetary Fund , is that the central bank guarantees to back the amount of currency in circulation with foreign exchange reserves at a given exchange rate . 
the central bank has pledged it will hold one mark for every one thousand levs in circulation and freeze the exchange rate at that level . 
Radev said that maintaining the restrictions of the 1997 Budget is a priority for the government . 
gross domestic product is to fall by a real 7.4 percent from 1996 after a real 10.9 percent fall previously . 
annual inflation is seen 566 percent . 
the high annual inflation is attributed mainly to 243 percent monthly inflation in February , triggered by political unrest earlier this year . 
since then , inflation since then has come down to 5.6 percent in May and minus 0.7 percent in April . 
monthly inflation is seen at two percent at the end of the year . 
on Friday central bank governor Svetoslav Gavriiski said that interest rates will remain stable over the next few months at current levels of around one percent . 
foreign debt interest payments due this year will account for 2.9 percent of GDP and domestic debt interest due is assumed at 6.9 percent of GDP .
