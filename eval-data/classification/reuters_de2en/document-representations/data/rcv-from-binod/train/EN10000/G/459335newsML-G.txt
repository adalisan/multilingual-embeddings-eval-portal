Cyprus will push for resuming a political dialogue with the European Union that stalled last month , its foreign minister said on Friday . 
a dialogue with the divided island was put on hold after disagreements between Greece and the other 14 EU members on the role of Turkish Cypriots in accession negotiations blocked the issuing of an EU position statement . 
&quot; We will submit a suggestion , as Cyprus , to all the member states on what we suggest as far as the common statement is concerned , &quot; Cypriot Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides told reporters . 
&quot; It is something we consider should be clarified , not be left open to different interpretations , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The negotiations must be with the Cyprus government , &quot; said Michaelides but the &quot; door was open &quot; to Turkish Cypriot groups to monitor the process under an agreed procedure . 
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded its northern third after a brief Greek Cypriot coup engineered by the military ruling Greece . 
a Turkish Cypriot breakaway state in the north is recognised only by Ankara , which has some 30,000 troops deployed there . 
the international community , with the exception of Turkey , recognises the Greek Cypriot administration as the island &apos;s only government . 
this month the United Nations started a new round of proximity talks between the two sides aimed at preparing direct negotiations between the leaders of the two communities . 
Michaelides said it would be &quot; unreasonable &quot; if the EU majority was using the stalled dialogue to press Greece , Cyprus &apos; closest ally , to lift its objections on EU aid for Turkey . 
Greece has blocked hundreds of millions of dollars in EU funds to Turkey in disputes over Cyprus and territory in the Aegean .
