Slovenian shares ended marginally in negative territory on Tuesday as investors and traders continued to huddle on the sidelines amid a lack of trading incentives . 
overall 11 shares fell , three rose and one was flat , while 13 were untraded . 
turnover rose to 91.3 million tolars from 44.8 million . 
&quot; ratification of the association accord with the EU has already been factored in to prices so it may only move the index by a few percent , &quot; said Andrej Potocnik , a trader at brokerage BPH . 
but non-ratification could hammer the blue-chip index down by about 20 to 30 percent in the short term . 
Parliament is expected to vote on whether to ratify the association agreement next week .

but turnover was low at just 15 shares . 
port operator Luka Koper eased 0.51 percent to 1,761 tolars on volume of 1,565 shares and brokers said the fall was due to selling from small shareholders , who received shares in exchange for the company &apos;s privatisation vouchers . 
Bank UBK was the top gainer , jumping 8.61 percent to 8,200 tolars on volume of 33 shares . 
demand continued to be high on the back of last week &apos;s announcement that Slovenia &apos;s second largest bank SKB was buying a 51 percent stake of UBK in June .
