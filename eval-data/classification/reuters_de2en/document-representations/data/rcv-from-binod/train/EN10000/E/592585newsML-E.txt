Japan &apos;s money supply growth in April was within the forecast of the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) , a senior BOJ official told reporters on Friday . 
the official said the April 1 increase in Japan &apos;s sales tax did not appear to be affecting Japan &apos;s money supply growth greatly . 
the BOJ last month announced that Japan &apos;s broadly defined money supply average of M2 plus certificates of deposit ( CDs ) was likely to grow by about three percent year-on-year in the April-June quarter . 
&quot; April &apos;s growth was within our quarterly outlook of about three percent growth , &quot; the official said . 
the BOJ said earlier on Friday that M2 plus CDs grew a preliminary 3.1 percent in April from a year earlier .
