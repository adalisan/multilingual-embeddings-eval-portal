the general index rose 0.11 percent to 2,284.39 in turnover of 3.90 billion crowns . 
&quot; The market took off after Handelsbanken &apos;s and Stadshypotek &apos;s shares resumed trading , &quot; a broker said . 
Stadshypotek rose six crowns to 188 crowns , while Handelsbanken jumped 7.5 crowns to 196 crowns . 
the two shares &apos; gains lifted the bank and insurance sector 2.63 percent , thereby becoming the day &apos;s winner . 
but on the other end of the stick was the forestry sector , which plummeted 1.88 percent on higher-than-expected Norscan figures , dealers said . 
earlier in the day , non-traded forestry company Sodra announced preliminary Norscan figures , which showed an increase in November by more than 185,000 tonnes from October .
