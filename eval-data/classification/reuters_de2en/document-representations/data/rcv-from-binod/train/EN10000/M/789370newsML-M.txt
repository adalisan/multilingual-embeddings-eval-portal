the Philippines &apos; secondary market for Treasury bills saw lacklustre trading on Friday , as banks bided time until a clear trend was established in the currency market , traders said . 
&quot; Everyone is holding on to their government securities first . 
with the central bank gradually lowering overnight rates , they just want to see if this would be a definite trend , &quot; a dealer said . 
they expect foreign banks to trade at the foreign exchange spot market next week , which would show whether the peso had already normalised and pave the way for lower interest rates . 
foreign banks were not allowed to trade two weeks ago to ease the pressure on the peso which was effectively devalued on July 11 . 
but on Thursday , a Bankers Association of the Philippines official said foreign banks should be invited again to trade . 
the average interbank call loan rate eased to 18.0625 percent from 18.09375 percent since most banks have squared their positions for the week . 
volume fell to 12.37 billion pesos from 16.92 billion . 
out of the 45 participating financial institutions , 25 were lenders .
