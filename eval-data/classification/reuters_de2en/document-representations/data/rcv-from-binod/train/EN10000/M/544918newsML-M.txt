a plan to allow non-sugar crops intended for yeast production to be grown on set-aside land is due to be studied by the European Union &apos;s sugar management committee on Wednesday , an EU member state official said . 
&quot; The committee will discuss the possible impact on the sugar industry , &quot; the official said on Monday . 
the EU &apos;s cereals management committee is due in May to discuss a draft proposal to allow farmers to use set-aside land to grow crops for yeast production . 
under the 1992 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) a programme of setting aside land to limit cereals cultivation was introduced to cut excess production .
