Asian stock markets received a boost on Tuesday from Wall Street &apos;s strong overnight rise and easing fears about higher interest rates , brokers said . 
Tokyo stocks ended up nearly 1.8 percent on the Dow &apos;s 74-point rise on Monday , but the Nikkei &apos;s upside might be limited before Friday when September options and futures expire , brokers said . 
elsewhere , Philippine shares ended a five-day losing streak , rising 1.12 percent , but Thai stocks fell on deepening fears about the economy and a report by Morgan Stanley that it had cut its weighting for Thailand and Hong Kong . 
in Tokyo , investors cheered the Dow Jones &apos; 1.31 percent gain to 5,733.84 , and dealers said the rise signalled rate fears had eased . 
the key 225-share Nikkei average gained 357.32 points , or 1.77 percent , to close at 20,559.59 . 
&quot; The second day of gains in the New York market prompted investors to bargain-hunt blue-chip issues , &quot; said Masaaki Higashida , deputy general manager at Nomura Securities . 
Stronger-than-expected Japan machinery orders for July , released late in the afternoon , helped support the stock market , brokers said . 
orders rose 13.6 percent in July from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis . 
Hong Kong &apos;s Hang Seng Index rallied strongly in the morning , but the desire to buy lost steam in the afternoon as investors reviewed Morgan Stanley &apos;s weighting cut for the Hong Kong market , analysts said . 
the Hang Seng index closed 11.02 points higher at 11,223.62 after rising to 11,334.40 earlier in the session . 
brokers said share prices began fading in the afternoon as investors discussed last Thursday &apos;s reweighting by Morgan Stanley of the Hong Kong and Thai markets . 
&quot; People were talking about it , &quot; said Glenn Lesko , head of sales trading HG Asia . 
Morgan Stanley dropped Hong Kong &apos;s weighting to 20.5 percent from 23.0 percent and Thailand &apos;s was cut to 6.5 percent from nine percent . 
news of the lower weighting hit Thai stocks , which extended losses for the ninth consecutive session . 
market sentiment was already poor because of political uncertainty and a weak economic outlook , brokers said . 
&quot; Foreigners remained net sellers and banks and finance firms were the targets . 
the market got another bit of bad news that Morgan Stanley cut Thailand &apos;s weighting , &quot; a broker at Union Securities said . 
the dollar hovered against the yen in late Tokyo with trading in a very narrow range all day . 
the greenback tried to break through a strong resistance of 109.50 yen in morning trade but succumbed to profit-taking and heavy selling pressure from overseas funds , Japanese insurers and exporters , dealers said . 
in Singapore , SIMEX Brent futures were untraded in late afternoon dealings , but brokers said they expected London to open moderately firmer . 
October Brent was quoted at $ 22.55 / $ 22.60 per barrel in late dealings , versus London &apos;s day-earlier close of $ 22.61 . 
gold closed lower in Hong Kong , extending the decline that set in in New York overnight , dealers said .
