U.S. West Coast crude prices drifted lower in talk quieted by the start soon of a number of refinery maintanence projects in the region , traders said . 
BP Oil and other sellers of local benchmark Alaska North Slope ( ANS ) were holding out for prices around a $ 1.70 discount to February delivery . 
but buyers still expect that to weaken toward $ 2 and are reluctant to buy . 
traders said most players in the region , including Mobil , Texaco Chevron had already taken all the steps necessary to prepare for the outages , and that their level of activity was likely to continue in the coming days and weeks at low levels . 
only Exxon , which is said to be planning maintenance at its Bencia refinery east of San Francisco during February has apparently not prepared for its work , but some questioned whether that even mattered . 
&quot; The only guy who hasn &apos;t prepared is Exxon , but if he &apos;s got extra ANS around he can just ship it down to the Gulf Coast , &quot; said one trader . 
talk on some of the intra-state grades was also exceedingly subdued , as differentials off the Kern River grade in the San Joaquin Valley weakened following the raising of posted prices effective Monday .
