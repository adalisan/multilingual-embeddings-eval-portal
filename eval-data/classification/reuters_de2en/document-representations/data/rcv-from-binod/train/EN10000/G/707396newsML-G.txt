Mexico has developed a colourful vocabulary of election terms over the years , appropriate for a country where the cleanliness of the electoral process has often been the biggest issue . 
announcement of the official results has more often than not been accompanied by cries of foul play by opposition parties as the Instituional Revolutionary Party ( pri ) cruises to yet another victory . 
the pri has held power for 68 unbroken years here and hopes to prolong that record in Sunday &apos;s national elections . 
the government and the newly independent Federal Electoral Institute have said these will be the cleanest elections ever . 
Acarreados : supporters bused in to rallies in return for free food , drink , T-shirts and baseball caps with a party logo . 
Alquimista electoral . 
an &quot; alchemist &quot; who turns unpromising election results into numerous pri seats in Congress . 
Carro completo . 
&quot; All aboard . 
&quot; When a party wins every single seat up for grabs at an election , as the pri did in the Senate until 1988 . 
Carrusel . 
Party members go on a &quot; merry-go-round &quot; of polling booths , voting in each one with the connivance of corrupt polling officials . 
Hueso : a &quot; bone &quot; in the form of a government job or political post tossed some one &apos;s way in return for services rendered . 
Fantasmas . 
&quot; ghosts &quot; . 
registered voters who are in fact dead , registered at unlikely addresses such as statues or monuments , or in improbably large numbers at a small home . 
Mapaches . 
&quot; Racoons &quot; or mysterious figures who steal ballot boxes filled with opposition votes on election night : 
Periodicazo : newspaper advertisments blasting opposition parties and candidates . 
paid for by organisations no one has heard of . 
Rasurado del padron : &quot; shaving &quot; the electoral roll by eliminating voters who are known opposition activists . 
Raton loco : when only pri members know where polling stations are . 
the opposition run around like &quot; crazy mice &quot; looking for them and then give up . 
Tacos : Pre-endorsed ballots rolled up like tacos and stuffed into ballot boxes . 
Urnas panzonas : &quot; Pregnant &quot; ballot boxes that contain ready endorsed ballot papers before voting begins . 
as in a game of dominos , one player wins while another keeps all the chips .
