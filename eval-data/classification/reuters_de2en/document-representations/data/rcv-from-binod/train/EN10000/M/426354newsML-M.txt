Hungary &apos;s overnight interest rates closed lower on Friday after trading at slightly higher levels than on Thursday as the market prepared for March 10 tax-payments , traders said . 
the overnight rates closed at 20.75 percent , down from Thursday &apos;s 20.875 closing . 
the rates moved between 20.75 and 21.125 percent , but most deals were struck at 21 percent . 
&quot; We already felt the wind of the tax-payments on the 10th ( of the month ) , &quot; said Commerzbank &apos;s Sandor Tolonics . 
&quot; Probably this caused that very little rise . 
traders said the market was liquid and turnover was high .
