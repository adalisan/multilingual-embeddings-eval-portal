implied volatilities for U.S. debt options were flat to softer just before noon on Friday and December T-bond options were poised to expire quietly at noon , dealers said . 
&quot; We &apos;ve got the usual frustration with expiration in that there &apos;s pretty much an equally distributed open interest in the 114-00 , 115-00 and 116-00 calls , &quot; said Brad Tyl , senior vice president at Aubrey G Lanston . 
as a result , the expiration was having little effect on the underlying futures markets , he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s just not dramatic , &quot; he said . 
the only expiration-related excitement stemmed from a rumor , in the morning , that a large options player held 10,000 December 115-00 calls . 
traders who were short the calls were concerned the player would take profits above that level , which may have had some effect on the market , Tyl said . 
another options dealer said open interest in the December 115-00 call was slightly higher than other strikes , at 25,000 . 
as a result , he belived it unlikely the underlying futures market would close above that level . 
&quot; I don &apos;t expect the market to settle above 115-00 even ... that &apos;s about the excitement so far this expiration day , &quot; he said . 
implied volatility for March T-bond options was down 0.15 percentage point at 9.75 percent , dealers said . 
one large investment house was said to have bought 1000 March 110-00 puts and sold the same number of March 120-00 calls . 
&quot; That was the biggest bearish trade I &apos;ve seen coming into the option pit , &quot; one trader said . 
another house sold 3000 March 114-00 / 116-00 call spreads , which helped depress implied volatility , he said . 
implied volatility for March eurodollar options was also flat at 10.5 percent , said one dealer speaking from Chicago Mercantile Exchange . 
after a brisk morning , December T-bond futures appeared to have stalled near 115-00 and March euros were stuck near 94.50 , he said . 
&quot; We &apos;re stuck in a range right now . 
that &apos;s how you &apos;ve got to play it out , &quot; he said . 
he said one investment house sold 2000 June 94.50 calls . 
Tyl said trade in T-bond options indicates the underlying futures market may be topping out . 
the put-to-call ratio for T-bond options , which had been showing a two-to-one bias for calls , has begun to narrow with fewer calls in demand , he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s weaning ... meaning the market is running out of steam , &quot; he said .
