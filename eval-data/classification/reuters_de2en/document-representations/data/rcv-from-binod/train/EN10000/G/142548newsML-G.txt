Richard Gough , the most successful Rangers captain in modern times , is expected to leave Ibrox at the end of the season . 
Gough , 34 , has won six championship , three Scottish Cup and four League Cup winners &apos; medals since joining Rangers from Tottenham in October 1987 . 
it reported he will be given a free transfer in recognition of his services to the Scottish champions and could land a lucrative contract in the Japanese J-League . 
Gough was born in Stockholm and brought up in South Africa and joined Rangers when Graeme Souness was in charge . 
Rangers are now aiming for a record-equalling ninth successive title and manager Walter Smith paid tribute to his captain , saying : &quot; I hope he leaves us in the way he started -- in a winning way . 
&quot; It was a little bit of a surprise to hear he wanted to leave . 
he came to see me a few weeks ago with those thoughts in his head .
