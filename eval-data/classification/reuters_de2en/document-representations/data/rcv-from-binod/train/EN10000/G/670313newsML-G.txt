the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a last-minute appeal by a Mexican citizen set to be put to death for the 1985 murder of a Texas man in the third execution in as many days at the state prison here . 
Texas Gov. 
George Bush also refused a request to delay the execution , clearing the way for Irineo Tristan Montoya , 30 , to be executed by lethal injection shortly after 6 p.m. CDT ( 2300 GMT ) in a record 24th execution in the state this year . 
the courts &quot; have had ample opportunity to address all of the issues involved in this death penalty conviction , and therefore there are not grounds to delay it , &quot; Bush said in statement released by his office . 
Tristan on Wednesday bid goodbye to his family during a death-row visit , remaining calm even as protesters gathered outside the prison to begin a vigil in the hours before he was set to die . 
&quot; He didn &apos;t shed a tear . 
he hasn &apos;t lost his strength , his emotional equilibrium , for a single moment and his optimism is still alive , &quot; Mexico &apos;s Houston-based Consul-General Manuel Perez Cardenas , who witnessed the visit , told Televisa &apos;s midday news . 
Tristan turned down a chance to walk in the prison yard , and ordered a final meal of fish , French Fries , jalapenos , carrots and ice cream , a prison spokesman said . 
his fate has sparked protests on both sides of the border , including an editorial in Wednesday &apos;s Fort worth Star telegram pressuring Gov. 
Bush to grant a 30-day reprieve to make sure Texas &quot; is doing the right and just thing . 
&quot; In Mexico , protesters gathered on a bridge between Matamoros and Brownsville , Texas , calling on Texas to halt the execution . 
the pending execution of Tristan , one of 12 Mexicans on the Texas death row , has stirred deep passions in his home country where there is no death penalty . 
Texas leads the nation in the number of executions since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 and the rapid pace this year has sparked renewed protests from international human rights groups . 
Amnesty International last month said Texas , which is set to kill eight death row inmates this month and is averaging an execution a week this year , is close to matching the pace of executions in countries with justice systems based on Islamic principles calling for harsh treatment for criminals . 
&quot; The state of Texas comes perilously close to matching Iran , Iraq and Saudi Arabia in their astoundingly high rates of execution , &quot; Amnesty International said in a statement . 
Tristan &apos;s execution will be witnessed by his father and two brothers and the Mexico Consul-General , whose government filed a diplomatic protest with the U.S. State Department alleging Tristan &apos;s rights were violated under international treaties after his arrest in Brownsville . 
Tristan was sentenced to die for the November 1985 murder of John Kilheffer , who was stabbed more than 22 times and dumped in a grapefruit grove near the Rio Grande . 
arrested two weeks later , Tristan confessed to his involvement in the killing but said another Mexican , Juan Villavicencio , actually killed the American , prosecutors said . 
Tristan , a shrimper from the northern Mexican border state of Tamaulipas who often found work in Brownsville , has spent 11 years on Texas death row and grew despondent with his treatment by U.S. courts . 
&quot; The justice system in this country is not working . 
it works for the rich , for the influential , not for minorities , &quot; he said in an interview last week . 
&quot; If I had been able to pay for a good defence and an investigator , all the charges would have been thrown away within a week of my arrest . 
Tristan &apos;s lawyer , Bonnie Goldstein , said his confession was written in English , a language the condemned man does not speak , and he was not informed of his right to meet with Mexican consulate officials after his arrest .
