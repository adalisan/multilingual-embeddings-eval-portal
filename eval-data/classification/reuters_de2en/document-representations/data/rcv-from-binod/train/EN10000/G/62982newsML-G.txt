four private fee-paying Egyptian universities open their gates to students for the first time this month to a chorus of anguished predictions that they spell the end of an era for Egyptian higher education . 
only a few hundred students are taking the private route to a degree , compared with more than 250,000 registering at state universities , but the innovation is another nail in the coffin for the equal-opportunity state promised in the 1960s . 
the new universities , the detractors say , will put profit before quality , drain the best teachers from the state sector and provide stupid rich kids with a fast track to good jobs . 
no , say the supporters , they will provide value for money , maintain high standards with low student-teacher ratios and bring new and dynamic skills to the Egyptian job market . 
where both sides do agree is that the state universities have been in permanent crisis for years and that the new institutions go hand in glove with the Egyptian government &apos;s policies of deregulation and trimming the state sector . 
a law passed in 1992 legalised private universities in principle but it was another four years before the cabinet gave the final go-ahead for the first four to open . 
it is the same cabinet that has accelerated privatisation , making Egypt the current darling of international investors . 
not surprisingly , the battle lines are drawn along much the same lines as the long conflict between supporters of 1960s socialism and advocates of free enterprise and personal choice . 
&quot; These new private universities contradict the principle of equal opportunities in education , which is guaranteed by the constitution , &quot; said Sameh Ashour , a member of parliament from the left-wing Nasserite Party . 
&quot; People say it will have an extreme effect on social stability , because the profit factor will dominate , &quot; added Nabil Badran of al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies . 
&quot; But private education is nothing new in Egypt . 
there are hundreds of private schools of all types and levels . 
many of us , including opponents of private universities , send their children to them , &quot; answers Gamal Abdelgawad of the same centre . 
private schools have sprouted like mushrooms since the first wave of economic reform in the 1970s , a natural response to overcrowded , shortstaffed and underfunded state schools . 
the state universities have similar problems : the student-teacher ratios range from about 50-1 at prestigious Cairo University to 450-1 on the campuses in southern Egypt . 
state-sector lecturers receive subsistence wages , compared with salaries of between 3,000 and 10,000 pounds ( $ 1,000 to $ 3,000 ) a month at the new private universities . 
the ideological dispute aside , many Egyptians are also uncomfortable about the regulatory framework for the new universities , which are largely free of state interference . 
&quot; How can the ministry supervise these universities if it has minimal control over them ? 
and if the graduates of the public universities cannot find work easily then how will the graduates of these private universities find work ? 
&quot; said Ashour . 
other opponents portray them as fly-by-night operations , with no permanent buildings , no libraries or laboratories and not even a complete staff weeks before the start of term . 
but Nawal el-Degwi , one of the founders of the October University for Modern Sciences and Arts , disputes this and says she already has a full complement of lecturers and tutors . 
&quot; The aim of this university is to graduate quality students who are able to cope and adapt in today &apos;s competitive fields . 
the university will be affiliated with Sheffield University in Britain , which prepared the curriculum , &quot; she added . 
Degwi &apos;s establishment will start small , with no more than 50 students in each of its five faculties this year , but once the first students graduate it plans to offer masters degrees and doctorates , she said . 
&quot; How can newly established universities decide to have masters and PhD programmes ? 
what about the qualified teachers for these programmes ? 
&quot; objects Etidal Mahfouz , a retired university economic professor . 
but in the end , the new universities will have to stand on their own merits , as in a market place , said Abdelgawad . 
if employers don &apos;t like the product , parents won &apos;t spend thousands of pounds ( dollars ) to send their children to them . 
already some potential students and their parents have hesitated to sign up for the new universities , for fear they will not find value for money . 
( $ = 3.4 pounds )
