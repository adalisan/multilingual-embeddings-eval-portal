in Europe &apos;s other major first divisions , the status quo was maintained at the top by Italians Vicenza , Spain &apos;s Real Madrid and PSV Eindhoven of the Netherlands . 
England 
arsenal &apos;s French manager Arsene Wenger praised his team &apos;s fighting spirit after they defied the odds to beat Newcastle 2-1 and replace Kevin Keegan &apos;s side at the top of the premier league . 
the London side led through Lee Dixon after 11 minutes but were reduced to 10 men for the second successive match when skipper Tony Adams was sent off for grappling with his England team mate Alan Shearer midway through the first half . 
Shearer , the world record 15 million pounds sterling ( $ 25 million ) signing from Blackburn in the northern summer , equalised after 21 minutes . 
arsenal subsequently survived an almost constant bombardment to escape with three points after Wright grabbed what proved to be the winner after an hour . 
France 
Paris Saint-Germain snatched back the lead from Monaco when they came from behind to beat lowly Caen 3-1 away . 
with Brazilian Leonardo inspirational in midfield , PSG scored through Panama &apos;s Julio Cesar Dely Valdes , his eighth league goal of the season , and France midfielders Vincent Guerin and Bruno N &apos;Gotty . 
Monaco won 1-0 at Montpellier to hold a two-point lead for 24 hours but PSG have now 42 points to Monaco &apos;s 41 after 20 matches . 
Chadian playmaker Japhet N &apos;Doram missed a twice taken penalty but ended up with a hat-trick as Nantes won 5-1 against 10-man Cannes , who had defender David Jemmali sent off , to become the biggest scorers in the division with 37 goals , one more than Monaco . 
Germany 
Early-season leaders Bayer Leverkusen seized the chance to return to the top with a 4-2 win over Cologne . 
goals from Markus Happe , Ulf Kirsten , a glorious drive into the top corner from Brazilian Paulo Sergio and an own goal from Karsten Baumann decided the Rhineside derby for the home side , all coming in a pulsating second-half display . 
Leverkusen and second-placed Bayern Munich are separated only by goal difference before next weekend &apos;s final round of matches ahead of the winter break . 
Bayern won an important psychological battle with a 1-1 draw at VfB Stuttgart , the most impressive team in the Bundesliga in the first half of the season . 
Stuttgart needed an 80th-minute goal from Dutch captain Frank Verlaat to save the match after Bayern took an early lead on a seventh-minute penalty by German international midfielder Mario Basler . 
Italy 
Vicenza coach Franceso Guidolin watched his side draw 1-1 to restore their historic one-point lead over Internazionale at the top of serie A -- and then warned about the threat of relegation . 
&quot; Our aim at the start of the season was to avoid relegation from the first division , &quot; said Guidolin , whose team is setting the pace in serie A for the first time in their 94-year history . 
&quot; Only when that aim is achieved can we start thinking about other objectives like the championship . 
Alessandro Iannuzzi , a close season buy from Lazio , moved Vicenza closer to first division salvation when a 10th minute shot from the edge of the penalty area put his side 1-0 up against Perugia . 
Carmine Gautieri equalised in the 33rd , but the away point was enough to give unfancied Vicenza 21 points from 11 matches , one more than Inter , who had briefly drawn level after drawing 2-2 at home to Cagliari . 
Spain 
real Madrid ensured they would start next weekend &apos;s clash with arch-rivals Barcelona as leaders by beating Sporting Gijon 1-0 away . 
with 35 points from 15 games , Real go four clear of Barcelona , who play struggling Extremadura on Monday .

a solitary goal from Frenchman Corentin Martins ensured Deportivo Coruna three points from their game at Sevilla and with it second place . 
Netherlands 
Ajax Amsterdam &apos;s miserable league season continued when the defending champions were held 1-1 after Groningen &apos;s Dean Gorre scored a late equaliser . 
Ajax dropped to sixth in the first division , 13 points behind leaders PSV Eindhoven , who beat NEC Nijmegen 4-1 on Saturday and have 42 points from 18 matches . 
the Amsterdam team launched an early siege that was rewarded with a ninth minute goal from Ronald de Boer , then held the slim lead until the 81st minute when they failed to clear a Groningen attack , allowing Gorre to equalise .
