U.S. Treasury prices opened higher on Wednesday as investors anticipated a friendly February consumer price report . 
in a Reuters poll , the government &apos;s Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) was forecast , on average , to be up 0.2 percent overall and 0.2 percent when the index &apos;s more volatile food and energy components were deleted . 
the impact of such a reading on the market is expected to be minor , however . 
that is because many Federal Reserve officials have stated that the Fed must act &quot; pre-emptively &quot; against inflation . 
the market has interpreted that to mean that the Fed could raise interest rates at its March 25 meeting in a response to strong economic growth , tight Labor markets and potential wage and price pressures . 
James Blumenthal , economist at MCM Moneywatch , said treasuries did a bit better overseas due to some buying in London but he said the the CPI report is what the market is waiting for . 
&quot; A good number is expected so the market would certainly be vulnerable to a stronger than expected CPI gain , &quot; he said . 
the market will also watch Fed Chairman Greenspan &apos;s testimony before the House Banking Committee later today , Blumenthal said . 
&quot; The market will be watching that , but tomorrow will be more important because today he &apos;s talking about financial services but tomorrow he &apos;s in front of the Joint Economic Committee and that &apos;s more focused on the economy so that might interest people more than today &apos;s testimony , &quot; Blumenthal said . 
Greenspan is set to testify before the Joint Economic Committee on monetary policy , interest rates and other issues at 1000 est / 1500 GMT on Thursday . 
the other item of interest to the market is the Treasury &apos;s announcement this afternoon of the terms of its monthly two- and five-year note auctions . 
the Treasury will sell those notes next week . 
in early dealings before the release of the February Consumer Price Index , the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 11 / 32 to 96-4 / 32 , yielding 6.93 percent . 
the spread between the two-year note and 30-year bond was at 76 basis points , from 80 basis points late last week . 
the two-year note was up 2 / 32 to 99-15 / 32 to yield 6.17 percent , while the five-year note was up 5 / 32 at 98-28 / 32 to yield 6.52 percent . 
ten-year notes were up 7 / 32 at 96-27 / 32 to yield 6.69 percent . 
at the short end of the maturity range , three- six- and year-bill rates were each down one basis point to 5.13 percent , 5.26 percent and 5.43 percent , respectively .
