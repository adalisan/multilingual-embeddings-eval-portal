Singapore shares closed lower on Friday as the market corrected to reflect an overnight fall on Wall Street and continued disappointment in the annual results reported by domestic blue chips , dealers said . 
the barometer Straits Times Industrials Index ( STII ) ended down 18.87 at 2,135.46 marking a new low for the year . 
&quot; We said the market would be weak through the early part of March , find a new low and then go up as it got the results it was expecting , but I don &apos;t think we &apos;ve quite found the low point yet , &quot; said a dealer with a local brokerage . 
trade data due next week was not expected to guarantee lift . 
&quot; After the first quarter export figures we &apos;ll know for sure whether the economy will go up towards the seven percent level or head down towards five percent , &quot; another dealer said . 
the uncertainty depressed stocks . 
losers overwhelmed gainers 304 to 91 on volume of 209 million shares . 
Singapore Press foreign stock lost a dollar to Singapore $ 26.60 and Singapore Airlines foreign hit a year low of S $ 11.90 , down S $ 0.40 .
