the Malaysian central bank said on Friday it will continue with its tight monetary policy to contain excess demand and inflationary pressures . 
&quot; ... The stance of monetary policy will remain one of restraint , with the focus on the management of liquidity to contain excess demand and inflationary pressures , &quot; Bank Negara Malaysia &apos;s Governor Ahmad Mohamed Don said in a preface to the central bank &apos;s 1996 annual report . 
he warned that the central bank will not hesitate to introduce new measures if financial institutions do not keep their loans to the property sector and lending for &quot; speculative activities &quot; under control . 
&quot; Bank Negara will not compromise on the stability of the banking system . 
additional measures will , therefore , be introduced , if necessary , to ensure that the exposure of the banking industry to these sectors remains well within prudential limits , &quot; Ahmad said . 
the report said bank lending has increasingly been skewed to the &quot; less productive &quot; activities of consumption , stock purchases and the property sector . 
the Bank is more closely watching asset price inflation , which has risen steadily in recent years despite the stable performance of the consumer price index , Ahmad said . 
the Bank in 1995 introduced several measures to curb property and car loans , including putting maximum limits on the loans and shortening the repayment periods for these purchases . 
the central bank chief said the market was expecting in the latter part of 1996 some relaxation of the monetary restraint policy that has been in place since 1989 . 
&quot; However , the persistence of several potential sources of inflationary pressures would call for continued caution , &quot; Ahmad said . 
despite a projected moderation in consumer spending , domestic demand pressures are also likely to remain high this year , &quot; as growth in private investment is expected to accelerate , at a time when public investment remains strong &quot; . 
charges for various public utilities have also gone up along with a strong increase in food prices and continued wage pressures . 
&quot; Under these circumstances , the thrust of policies will need to remain firmly focused , both in the shorter and longer term , on controlling inflation on a broad front , &quot; Ahmad said .
