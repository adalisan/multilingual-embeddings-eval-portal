the &quot; Bill and Tony Show &quot; hit London on Thursday when the Clintons came to Downing Street as guests of Britain &apos;s new prime minister . 
if the so-called special relationship between London and Washington had been allowed to go off somewhat during the premiership of Tony Blair &apos;s predecessor John Major , it bloomed again in the English spring sunshine . 
&quot; Tony &apos;s new best friend drops in , &quot; was the headline in the London Evening Standard . 
Tony and Cherie Blair greeted Bill and Hillary Clinton warmly on the steps of No 10 Downing Street , where both couples beamed and shook hands for the cameras . 
inside , Clinton was accorded the rare honour of being invited to address the cabinet , and surprised the assembled ministers by disclosing that he was familiar with key passages of the manifesto that helped Blair to power in his landslide May 1 election victory . 
after being applauded as he entered the cabinet room , Clinton declared with a laugh that he had little advice to pass on to a prime minister who had just won a thumping 179 seat majority in the House of Commons . 
Blair was quick off the mark to praise the man on whose campaigning successes he had modelled his own march to power , saying that Clinton did have one thing to show him -- how to get re-elected . 
after talks and lunch -- and while Hillary and Cherie went off to watch some Shakespeare -- Clinton and Blair moved into the sunlit Downing Street rose garden where the two leaders addressed a joint news conference . 
&quot; I &apos;ve aleady seen part of what I wanted to see , a most unique and unspeakably beautiful British spring , &quot; said Clinton , who knows the country well from his student days . 
the two men were pressed about their similarities -- they are both after all Oxford-educated rock fans married to high-flying lawyers -- and Blair has been described by critics as a Clinton clone . 
Clinton , who has been forced to walk with a silver-topped cane because of a knee injury , joked that he was different from the 44-year-old Blair in one important respect . 
&quot; I do resent this because he is seven years younger than me with no grey hairs . 
Clinton then quipped that his own honeymoon with America had lasted &quot; about 35 seconds &quot; after his election and he warned Blair not to take his eye of the ball . 
&quot; My only advice is to maintain the same level of concentration in administration that was shown by all of Labour in the campaign , &quot; the president said . 
&quot; relaxed concentration is fatal in this business . 
after the news conference , the Clintons went to the American ambassador &apos;s residence in Regent &apos;s Park before setting off for dinner with the Blairs at the chic Le Pont de la Tour restaurant . 
there is a symmetry to this -- the restaurant is part of a &quot; gastrodome &quot; complex on the banks of the River Thames owned by style guru Sir Terence Conran , who is tipped to play a part in the Blair government . 
both men were still wearing dark suits for their double date , while Hillary was sporting a tailored Robin &apos;s egg blue suit and Cherie was in a grey dress and wearing a gold necklace . 
before sitting down to dinner they stood on the embankment overlooking the Thames and posed for pictures with the Tower of London in the background while knots of bystanders looked on impassively .
