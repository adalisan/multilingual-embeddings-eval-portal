an crowded bus overturned on Friday killing 23 passengers and injuring dozens more as it travelled between the popular tourist towns of Cusco and Nasca in the high altitude plains of Peru , officials said . 
no foreigners died in the accident that occurred in fog about 500 miles ( 800 km ) southeast of Lima in the Pampa Galeras of the Ayucucho department , Augusto Ciccia , the bus company &apos;s administrator , told Reuters . 
but at least one foreign tourist was injured , he said , without giving the passenger &apos;s nationality . 
police and fire fighting officers said the death toll included one infant and that up to as many 50 other passengers were injured in the accident . 
witnesses believed the bus crashed at a spot known as toro Muerto , or Dead Bull , and the cause was likely faulty brakes , police said . 
officials of the bus company , who earlier claimed the death toll was no more than 10 , said they had since received updated information , bringing the number of deaths in line with the authorities &apos; reports . 
the frequency of road accidents in the Peruvian Andes , where most people travel along poorly maintained highways on buses that are often overloaded , has led pressure groups to call for an overhaul of the country &apos;s transport regulations .
