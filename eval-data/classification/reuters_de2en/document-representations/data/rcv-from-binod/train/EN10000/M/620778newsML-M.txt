Swiss bonds ended firmer amidst a continued widening of the interest rate spread to German Bunds . 
the spread for 10-year swaps was quoted at around 230 basis points late Wednesday by one Swiss-based trader , who added that the spread was now at a historically wide level . 
he expected the spread to narrow again , either due to gains in German Bunds or a rise in Swiss bond yields . 
gains in Bunds may reflect concern about Germany &apos;s plan to revalue gold reserves to help meet the budget criteria necessary to participate in the single European currency . 
meanwhile , expansive Swiss money policy has favoured Swiss bonds . 
the market saw a short-squeeze early on when the June CONF touched a session high of 121.10 . 
it was the highest level for the CONF since the 121.15 contract high set on March 4 . 
the market was also waiting for the Swiss National Bank &apos;s weekly policy-setting meeting on Thursday . 
the SNB has made good on last Wednesday &apos;s announcement it would aggressively add liquidity to offset the Swiss franc &apos;s rise , bringing Swiss money rates below 1.00 percent . 
but traders generally expected the SNB would keep its discount at 1.00 percent at its meeting Thursday .

CONF futures up 18 at 120.73 . 
Comi medium-term bond down five at 112.00
