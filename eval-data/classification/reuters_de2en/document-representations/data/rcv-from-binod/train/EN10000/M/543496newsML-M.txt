--Overnight Cetes rate seen stable awaiting auction 
traders saw Mexican stocks drifting downwards at the open with pressure predicted on the peso with a bunch of statistics due from the United States and usual month-end corporate dollar demand . 
&quot; There is a total apathy on the part of investors in the stock market , &quot; one trader said , indicating his view was that the market would open flat to down in listless trading . 
traders said Q1 corporate earnings reports were not sufficiently rosy enough to produce an equity bullrun . 
&quot; They did not go down that well , &quot; one desk trader said . 
the peso was seen under pressure with corporate dollar demand in the run-up to the month end and all eyes on the U.S. long bond given a number of U.S. market-moving statistics are scheduled to be released in coming sessions , dealers added 
traders predicted a trading range of 7.9000 / 7.9200 per dollar for the benchmark 48-hour peso . 
Pre-open bids stood at 7.9050 / 7.9100 per dollar , compared to Friday &apos;s close of 7.8910 / 7.8960 . 
overnight rates on Cetes seen stable awaiting the weekly primary government securities auction , brought forward one day to Monday evening from the habitual Tuesday because of the May 1 Labor Day holiday in Mexico .
