the Jakarta stock index ended lower on Friday due to widespread profit-taking including in newly listed fisheries firm PT Daya Guna Samudra , brokers said . 
the Jakarta composite index closed down 4.55 points , or 0.79 percent , at 571.34 points in slow trade after touching an intra-day low of 569.88 points . 
Decliners led advancers by 66 to 38 , with 64 counters unchanged . 
brokers said the market was likely to continue being sluggish on Monday as many players were looking to cash in gains in preparation for the listing of Bank Negara Indonesia ( BNI ) next month . 
brokers said anticipation of BNI &apos;s upcoming initial public offering had dominated trading . 
BNI , the country &apos;s largest state-owned bank , set an offer price on Thursday of 850 rupiah for its shares . 
it plans to float 1.1 billion shares from November 4 to 7 . 
&quot; After long and tiring speculation on car maker Astra International , I think it is normal for the market to take a rest before start a new phase in November , &quot; said one broker . 
fisheries firm Daya Guna Samudra topped the active list with 22.7 million shares changing hands , falling 75 rupiah to 2,225 rupiah after risisng to 2,400 rupiah in early trade . 
Astra International also fell on profit-taking , brokers said . 
it fell 50 rupiah to 3,950 rupiah on a turnover of 1.4 million shares after rising to 4,100 in morning trade . 
brokers said huge transactions in Astra in Surabaya on Thursday seemed to limit speculation over the automobile company . 
&quot; Many believed the story of Astra is ended . 
the Nusamba group has already achieved its target of controlling a substantial slice of Astra , &quot; said one foreign broker . 
selective foreign buying is likely on the stock following its excellent nine-month result , &quot; said one broker . 
secondary spices producer Miwon and confectionary firm Mayora Indah were also among the losers . 
Miwon fell 100 rupiah to 1,575 rupiah on a volume of 2.7 million shares .
