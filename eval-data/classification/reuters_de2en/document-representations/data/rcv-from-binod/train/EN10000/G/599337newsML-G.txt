the main rivals in France &apos;s tight parliamentary election traded accusations over the planned single European currency on Tuesday , five days before Sunday &apos;s first round of voting . 
centre-right Prime Minister Alain Juppe charged that victory for the left-wing opposition in the May 25-June 1 poll could endanger France &apos;s place in European economic and monetary union . 
&quot; It would be a shambles in Europe , firstly because the Socialists and Communists don &apos;t agree among themselves ... and also because the Socialists &apos; economic policy , with extra spending and deficits , would push us off track for European ( monetary ) union , &quot; he told RTL radio . 
&quot; We have made conditions so that the euro will succeed . 
I rather have the feeling that ( Socialist leader ) Lionel Jospin is making conditions so it will fail , &quot; Juppe said . 
Jospin told the newspaper Le Monde there would be no crisis over the single currency if the left won and accused the centre-right government of kowtowing to Germany . 
the Socialist chief said he would not feel bound by a &quot; stability pact &quot; , adopted by European Union leaders in Dublin last December , limiting the public deficits of countries that join the euro once it is launched in 1999 . 
&quot; The stability pact adds conditions which do not figure in the Maastricht treaty . 
the pact is a sort of &apos; super-Maastricht &apos; and a concession which the French government had absurdly made to the Germans , or to certain German circles , &quot; Jospin said . 
&quot; No one wants a crisis with France , and France will not have to provoke a crisis , but it will have a greater weight than it has had up to now , &quot; he said . 
the euro debate left financial markets unmoved . 
the franc was steady against the German mark , but French shares were 1.4 percent down on fears of a possible U.S. interest rate rise . 
economists say the two major parties differ more in rhetoric than in substance on EMU . 
in his radio interview , Juppe set out conditions almost identical to the Socialists &apos; terms , including the establishment of an &quot; economic government &quot; alongside the planned independent European central bank . 
Jospin said he was open to negotiation on the Socialists &apos; four conditions -- an &quot; economic government &quot; as a counterweight to the central bank , a pact for growth and jobs , the inclusion of Italy and Spain from the outset , no overvaluation of the euro compared to the dollar . 
&quot; We set conditions and we open a discussion . 
this is not a &apos; take it or leave it &apos; , &quot; he said . 
in the search for a winning photo opportunity , Juppe toured the building site of new French national soccer stadium in northern Paris , where the 1998 World Cup final will be played . 
opinion polls published before a legal blackout went into force at midnight last Saturday showed the centre-right and the combined left virtually level in voting intentions , with the right projected to win a majority of between 39 and 100 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly . 
the right &apos;s projected lead in seats , which narrowed slightly over the last week , was mainly due to expectations that a majority of voters for the extreme-right National Front would switch to centre-right candidates on the second round . 
national Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen suggested last week he would prefer a left-wing majority in parliament because it could paralyse what he called Chirac &apos;s &quot; criminal project &quot; to dissolve France in the single European currency . 
but after criticism from the ranks of his anti-immigration party , Le Pen changed tack at a rally in Lyon on Monday night . 
&quot; I never said people should vote for the left , I simply said in a rather complex analysis that obviously I would rather see a left-wing majority and cohabitation , &quot; the anti-immigration crusader told the Foreign Press Association on Tuesday .
