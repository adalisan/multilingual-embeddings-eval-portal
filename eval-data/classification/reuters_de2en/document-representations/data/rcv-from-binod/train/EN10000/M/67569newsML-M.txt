the dollar remained sidelined in European trading as traders remained fixated on next week &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meeting in the U.S. and focused on the mark &apos;s slide on its European crosses . 
convergence trades were back in vogue , depressing the mark amid growing bullishness about monetary union as European Union finance ministers meet in Dublin today and Saturday . 
the French franc rose to two-month highs below 3.39 per mark . 
traders said options-related orders accelerated the franc &apos;s rally . 
one European corporate was said to have triggered a stop-loss involving the sale of over one billion marks . 
&quot; The mark is generally weak on the crosses , but it was the surging French franc that grabbed the market &apos;s attention , &quot; said Philippe Delmotte , a corporate trader at Bank of Boston . 
mark weakness helped the dollar reach a high of 1.5185 , where it hit a walll of sales , said Delmotte . 
&quot; There &apos;s a firm cap on the mark there , and the ranges might not be broken in the run-up to the FOMC meeting next week , &quot; the trader said . 
at 1429 GMT , the dollar was at 1.5154 / 60 marks and 109.79 / 89 yen versus 1.5155 / 58 and 109.39 / 44 at the European close on Thursday . 
the French franc was at 3.3884 / 88 per mark compared with 3.4045 / 50 . 
some traders estimated trading volume in mark / French franc at almost three times that of dollar / mark , which normally sees the bulk of foreign exchange trade . 
the informal meeting of European finance ministers in Dublin today and Saturday is expected to frame an agreement on the post-EMU European exchange rate mechanism . 
&quot; The EMU theme is dominant in the forex market , and anything that &apos;s good for EMU is bad for the mark , &quot; said Giorgio Radaelli , international economist at Lehman Brothers . 
several official comments ahead of the Dublin meeting also showed the heightened political determination to support the EMU process , analysts said . 
French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis and his German counterpart Theo Waigel co-wrote an article in the International Herald Tribune today which said both countries are now &quot; more than ever convinced &quot; EMU will happen on time and be a success . 
&quot; There might still be some wrangling over how rigid the stability pact should be but the political determination to make EMU work can &apos;t be ignored , &quot; said Radaelli . 
the market is still preoccupied with next Tuesday &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meeting , and opinion is still divided over the possible outcome . 
a Reuter poll showed that 17 out of 30 polled expected a rate rise on September 24 . 
some argue that retail sales below expectations and benign inflation data might prevent a credit tightening at this stage . 
others point to signs of tightening labour markets and wage pressures as justifying a rate rise . 
&quot; This division is making the market quite nervous - too nervous to take a decisive position on the dollar , &quot; said Delmotte at Bank of Boston . 
traders said dollar buying for yen to cover part of a $ 7.0 billion aid package to India helped dollar / yen higher . 
Japan is the largest donor with 135 billon yen . 
it is still about half a yen below Wednesday &apos;s levels , before it weakened sharply on news of an almost 43 percent surge in the U.S. trade deficit in July . 
dealers said 109.90 yen , former support and now resistance , capped the dollar . 
Japanese markets will be closed for a public holiday on Monday .
