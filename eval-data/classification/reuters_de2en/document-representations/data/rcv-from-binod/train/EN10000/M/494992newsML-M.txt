Greek equities ended 0.20 percent lower on Tuesday with market analysts saying it was the result of profit taking but remaining bullish for 1997 , expecting the benchmark index to reach the 1,700-1,800 level , by year-end . 
&quot; Tuesday &apos;s session was one of profit-taking . 
the day &apos;s high was 1,441.32 points . 
this level was close to the bourse &apos;s last high at 1,453.60 points , where the market closed on February 26 , &quot; said analyst Nikos Kostopoulos , at Commercial Securities . 
if the general share index consolidates above the 1,400 level for the next few sessions , it could easily pierce the 1,450-1,500 level in the short term , he added . 
&quot; On Friday and Monday the rise was milder than the ones we witnessed towards the end of February . 
this time the bourse &apos;s climb is more solid and steady . 
if trading volume increases , it will be another good sign , &quot; he said . 
Kostopoulos remained bullish in his 1997 outlook , saying the index could rise to 1,700-1,800 points by year-end . 
another analyst said that the Greek bourse continues to be highly attractive among other emerging markets . 
he added that the only concern for investors could be press reports of lower-than-expected tax revenue growth in March . 
&quot; Government expenditures also seem to have risen more than expected . 
however , the drop in T-bills rates may more than compensate for that , &quot; he added . 
the Athens general share index closed 0.20 percent or 2.86 points lower at 1,436.55 from Monday &apos;s 1,439.41 close , after opening at 1,441.32 .
