Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Wednesday that inflation was the key determinant to a decision on monetary policy . 
Costello had been asked by reporters whether the U.S. Federal Reserve &apos;s decision later on Wednesday on U.S. interest rates would have any influence on domestic monetary policy . 
&quot; Monetary policy is set with regard to a host of factors and of course we take into account in Australia international developments , &quot; said Costello . 
&quot; But ... we are setting monetary policy in this country with regard to domestic factors and principally our inflation target . 
so it &apos;s the inflation target , which has been spelled out in the agreement between the governor ( of the Reserve Bank ) and me , that counts , &quot; Costello told reporters . 
the RBA , which held its monthly board meeting on Tuesday , aims to keep underlying inflation averaging 2-3 percent over the course of an economic cycle . 
&quot; We always have regard to international factors , but that ( inflation ) is the key determinant to monetary policy in this country , &quot; Costello said . 
annual underlying inflation growth stood at 2.1 percent in the March quarter , unchanged from the previous quarter . 
the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee finishes a two-day meeting on Wednesday and there has been speculation it could sanction a U.S. rate hike . 
such an increase would take official U.S. rates above those in Australia , which some analysts felt could limit the RBA &apos;s room to ease policy here .
