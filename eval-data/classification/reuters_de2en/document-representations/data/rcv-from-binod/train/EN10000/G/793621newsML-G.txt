police on Tuesday arrested Hartmut Hopp , a leader of a controversial German colony beset by sex scandal allegations , after a high-speed car chase in southern Chile . 
Hopp , a doctor at Colonia Digidad or Dignity Colony , faced an arrest warrant for allegedly covering up child sexual abuse at the settlement and being an accomplice of its fugitive leader Paul Schaefer . 
&quot; He was travelling in a car with three German citizens who are believed to be from the colony . 
( Hopp ) was travelling on the floor of the car covered by a blanket , &quot; Deputy Interior Minister Belisario Velasco told reporters . 
&quot; The facts show that he had no intention of cooperating with the judicial system , &quot; the minister added . 
Hopp was detained at the end of a car chase along rural roads near the town of Linares , 200 miles ( 300 kms ) south of Santiago , after his vehicle driven by a German settler refused to stop at a police road block . 
Schaefer , the colony &apos;s founder , is the subject of an international arrest warrant after being charged last year with kidnapping and sexually molesting boys at the settlement . 
police raids on the colony in recent months have failed to find any trace of Schaefer , although two men who escaped from the colony in July said he was hiding in a network of tunnels built under forests at the settlement . 
&quot; Dr. Hopp is accused of being an accomplice ... allowing Schaefer to stay for a year in the colony avoiding judicial action , &quot; Velasco said . 
Hopp was arrested briefly two weeks ago after he failed to appear in court to answer allegations he illegally adopted his teenage son Michael from his biological Chilean mother , Sara Godoy , who said her son was abducted 10 years ago after she sent him for treatment at the colony &apos;s hospital . 
Velasco said the judges should also investigate charges made in 1966 that Hopp , now 53 , assaulted youngsters at the enclave . 
Court documents relating to the case have since disappeared . 
&quot; If this is investigated and found to be true , then this would change the circumstances . 
a person accused of the rape of children ... should not be able to adopt a child , &quot; he said . 
Hopp , who usually acts as the secretive settlement &apos;s spokesman , was one of the first teenagers to come to live at the colony founded by Schaefer in 1961 . 
Colonia Dignidad &apos;s opponents have accused its leaders of holding its 300 German-speaking residents in virtual slavery , using drugs and electric shocks to keep dissidents in line . 
settlers live in Bavarian houses behind barbed-wire fences at the sprawling colony in the foothills of the Andes .
