Australia on Monday denied Taiwanese media reports that it had refused a visa for a senior Taiwanese official to avoid offending China . 
&quot; The stories are not true , &quot; a government spokesman said . 
but he would not give any further details when asked if the Taiwanese official had applied for a visa to visit Australia . 
media in Taiwan had reported that Vice Minister for Overseas Chinese Affairs Ming Chun-hwa was refused a visa because Canberra wanted to avoid offending China ahead of a planned visit to Beijing by Prime Minister John Howard . 
Sino-Australian ties have been strained since Howard &apos;s conservative coalition won power a year ago . 
relations have been hit by a range of security and diplomatic issues , including a visit to Taipei by Primary Industries Minister John Anderson last year . 
Beijing regards Taiwan as a part of China and bitterly opposes any official recognition of the Taiwanese government . 
the Australian spokesman said Canberra regularly approved unofficial visits by Taiwanese leaders . 
Howard is due to visit China and Singapore next month in a bid to strengthen ties .
