a Texas man convicted of assaulting and strangling a 63-year old disabled woman during an attempted robbery more than 20 years ago was executed Monday at the state prison here . 
Billy Joe Woods , 50 , was convicted and sentenced to death for the October 1975 killing of Mabel Ehatt , who was found brutally beaten and nude from the waist down in her second floor Houston apartment , prosecutors said . 
captured by police coming out of Ehatt &apos;s ransacked apartment with a television set , Woods was convicted and sentenced to die by a Houston jury in a two-day trial in July 1976 . 
Woods lay silently on a gurney and said nothing before he was injected with a dose of lethal chemicals . 
he died shortly after 7 p.m. EDT in the death chamber of the Huntsville state prison . 
the execution was witnessed by his attorney , a niece and two friends , along with prison officials and reporters . 
the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals last week rejected an eleventh-hour request for a stay of execution , ending a string of appeals that had left Woods on the Texas death row for more than 20 years , prosecutors said . 
&quot; It &apos;s certainly not swift and sure punishment , &quot; Richard Dieter , executive director of the Death Penalty Information Centre in Washington , D.C. , said . 
of the 449 men and seven women on Texas &apos; death row at the Huntsville prison about 45 miles north of Houston , five have been there longer than Woods , prison officials said . 
Woods was the fifth person executed in Texas this year and the 112th in the state since capital punishment resumed in 1982 .
