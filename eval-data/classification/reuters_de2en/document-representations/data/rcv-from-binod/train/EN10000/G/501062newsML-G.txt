Pope John Paul will call for co-existence and forgiveness in Bosnia at the weekend when he makes a historic visit to its capital Sarajevo , scarred by siege and a war driven by ethnic and religious hatreds . 
senior Vatican officials said the 25-hour visit to the city , now mainly Moslem , would also test the Dayton peace deal that ended the conflict in 1995 in the extent to which Roman Catholic Croats were able to reach Sarajevo to see their Pope . 
&quot; The themes of the visit are solidarity and hope but hope is only possible if forgiveness is offered and received , &quot; one Vatican prelate familiar with the visit said . 
the trip , whose main event will be an open-air mass on Sunday at Sarajevo &apos;s Kosevo soccer stadium , is likely to be one of the most emotional in recent years of a papacy dogged by declining health and advancing age . 
it comes at a time of tensions in the shaky Bosnian federation between Croats and Moslems , with little sign that the ethnic separation wrought by their conflict and their war with Orthodox Serbs has been diminished by peace . 
fears for the 76-year-old Pope &apos;s security have been fuelled by a wave of attacks on churches and mosques over the past two months . 
a monastery and a church in central Sarajevo were among the targets of the attacks , none of which caused injuries . 
authorities in the capital say they will deploy thousands of local police for the visit . 
United Nations police and NATO forces have said they will provide support . 
&quot; As successor of Peter , I am going to confirm in faith our brothers and sisters in a city which , in a certain sense , has become a sad symbol of the tragedies which have struck Europe in the 20th century , &quot; the Pope said on Wednesday . 
&quot; May this Apostolic Visit also become a voyage of peace on which the Church bears witness to its solidarity with suffering men and peoples , &quot; he said at his weekly general audience . 
the Vatican welcomed the Dayton deal in as far as it halted the bloodshed but Vatican officials say they believe it also &quot; consecrated &quot; the ethnic cleansing perpetrated by all sides . 
Sarajevo had a pre-war population of 50,000 Catholics but the number is now down to 20,000 , according to Church sources . 
most Croats in Bosnia are now concentrated in the western Herzegovina region , with hardly any in areas of northern Bosnia around the Serb stronghold of Banja Luka . 
many are expected to try to reach Sarajevo by bus across ethnic dividing lines . 
&quot; If the presence of the Pope allows a truce of God to let people through then the trip itself will have contributed to reinforcing the Dayton accords , &quot; one Vatican official said . 
&quot; It will be a test of reconstruction and freedom of movement , &quot; one Vatican official said . 
the Bosnian conflict and the Serb siege of Sarajevo were constant themes of the Polish-born Pope &apos;s addresses for much of the past four years . 
during the war , he condemned religious bigotry and nationalism and since the peace has frequently urged Croats , Moslems and Bosnian Serbs to rebuild co-existence . 
&quot; The Pope is the symbol of reconciliation and understanding and in few places is that message as important and as necessary as in Sarajevo , &quot; the international community &apos;s High Representative in Bosnia , Carl Bildt , said earlier this year . 
the Pope had planned to visit Sarajevo in 1994 , while war was still raging , but cancelled the trip when Bosnian Serbs besieging the city said they could not guarantee his safety . 
this time , however , the visit has the support of all three members of Bosnia-Herzegovina &apos;s new collective presidency , including Serb representative Momcilo Krajisnik . 
the Pope , who leaves Rome on Saturday , is due to meet Bosnian leaders and representatives of other religious groups . 
the trip is the Pope &apos;s first since an appendix operation last October since when he has cut back on some of his public engagements . 
he is due to go later this month to Prague and also has trips this year to Lebanon , Poland , France and Brazil .
