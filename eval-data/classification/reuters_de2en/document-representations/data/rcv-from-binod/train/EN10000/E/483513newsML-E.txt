continued stable food prices and lower fuel prices are expected to keep year-on-year Philippine inflation in March about steady at 4.6 percent compared with 4.4 percent in February , a Reuter poll said . 
the forecast figure by six banks and securities firms collated this week is far below the 11.8 percent registered in March last year when the country experienced a severe shortage of rice . 
the March inflation figure is expected to be announced on Friday or Monday . 
&quot; There &apos;s not much inflationary expectation that would propel something more dramatic than was recorded in February , &quot; said Cecilia Tanchoco , an economist at Bank of the Philippine Islands . 
on a month-on-month basis , inflation could rise at the same pace of 0.4 percentage points in March , economists said .
