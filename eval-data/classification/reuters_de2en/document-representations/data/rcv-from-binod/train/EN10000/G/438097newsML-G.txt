Taiwan said on Wednesday it plans to send back two mainland Chinese hijackers currently on parole on the island , despite a lack of a formal hijacker repatriation agreement between Taipei and Beijing . 
&quot; We have already asked the Straits Exchange Foundation to arrange repatriation procedures with mainland , &quot; Shi Hwei-yow , vice chairman of the Cabinet-level mainland Affairs Council , said on state television . 
the Straits Exchange Foundation is Taiwan &apos;s quasi-official agency responsible for dialogues with China in the absence of official ties . 
Shi identified the two mainland Chinese eligible for repatriation as Huang Shugang and Han Fengying , who hijacked two planes to Taiwan in two separate cases in 1993 . 
Taiwan and China , rivals since the Nationalists fled to the island after losing China &apos;s civil war in 1949 , reached a semi-official accord in January 1995 on repatriating hijackers , but subsequent political tensions thwarted the deal &apos;s signing . 
Taiwan has urged China to repatriate a Taiwanese man who hijacked a commercial jet to China &apos;s southeastern port of Xiamen on Monday . 
Taipei so far has not sent back any of 16 mainland hijackers it has detained or released on parole .
