household spending on manufactured goods rose a healthy 1.9 percent in France in January , giving the government another positive indicator on the economy . 
national statistics office INSEE said in its monthly report that a 4.4 percent rise in retail spending -- in a month when stores held their post-Christmas discount sales -- more than compensated for a continued decline in car sales . 
however , INSEE revised its initial December data to report a spending fall of 1.3 percent from a previous estimate of a more limited 0.8 percent decline . 
the rise in January spending prompted mixed reactions from economists , with some saying it heralded more robust demand in the first quarter of 1997 , irrespective of the revision in the December data , but others remaining sceptical . 
&quot; This is a strong number . 
we &apos;re starting the first quarter with a very strong number on the demand side . 
&quot; We already knew car sales would continue to decline . 
the retail sector compensated . 
but seasonal sales started later than usual , on January 2 . 
they sometimes start at the end of December , so this time this may explain the strong January number and the weak December one , &quot; he added . 
David Naude , an economist at U.S. bank JP Morgan in Paris , said : &quot; First of all it &apos;s good news . 
it &apos;s clearly showing that the slide that took place in the fourth quarter has now come to an end . 
&quot; It doesn &apos;t tell us much about growth and genuine pickup , here we &apos;re seeing a recovery and we &apos;ll have to wait for the second quarter . 
but it &apos;s a sound reversal , coming quickly and robustly , &quot; he added . 
Michala Marcussen at Societe Generale offered a more sober assessment . 
&quot; This was very much in line with what we expected . 
a lot of it is because the ( winter retailer ) sales period was pushed forward this year . 
&quot; Overall consumption remains fairly weak . 
the situation remains so very depressed on the labour market , consumer sentiment remains depressed . 
I do not see why the economy should pick up unless there is a positive impact from the tax reform . 
the consumer spending figure followed the announcement on Tuesday that France set another trade surplus record of 122 billion francs ( $ 21.7 billion ) in 1996 . 
a January survey showed a marked improvement among industrialists on the prospects of a pick-up in industrial production in the coming months . 
a Reuter poll of 11 economists on Monday produced an average forecast of a 0.8 percent rise , with several saying the figure would be helped by retailers &apos; winter discount sales . 
spending on cars , which has been suffering since the end of government car-buying incentives in September , fell 11.5 percent in January .
