opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi on Monday sought to patch up cracks in his centre-right bloc and salvage a cross-party deal on constitutional reform designed to make Italy &apos;s government more effective and durable . 
Berlusconi returned home at the weekend from a Caribbean holiday to find signs of mutiny from his chief ally , hard-right leader Gianfranco Fini , over a planned bi-cameral commission to work out changes to Italy &apos;s outdated 1948 constitution . 
Fini has backed a proposal by ex-president Francesco Cossiga to wreck a key vote on the commission in the Senate ( upper house ) on Wednesday and force a referendum in favour of creating a constituent assembly to tackle the reforms instead . 
Berlusconi , who has negotiated closely with Massimo D &apos;Alema , leader of the biggest party in Prime Minister Romano Prodi &apos;s centre-left government , summoned his Freedom Alliance partners for a vote on Tuesday to endorse a unified position . 
&quot; If they vote yes , the bi-cameral committee will go through . 
&quot; The real problem is that there is ... a crisis in the opposition which is struggling to give itself a strategy , a leadership , &quot; said D &apos;Alema , head of the ex-communist Democratic Party of the Left . 
both houses of parliament voted in favour of a bi-cameral commission last summer but must do so a second time before the 70-member body can begin work . 
the Senate vote will be followed by a vote in Chamber of Deputies on January 21 . 
change requires a two-thirds majority of members of parliament . 
Publio Fiori , a senior hard-right deputy , warned that the bi-cameral committee would be the end of the Freedom Alliance unless it won guarantees on what reforms would be tackled , including a commitment to presidential-style government . 
&quot; The bi-cameral commission would be born but the Freedom Alliance would die because an unbreachable rupture would clearly emerge between two ways of conceiving politics and interpreting the drive to change the country , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Everyone comes to the commission with their own proposals , they present them , they are discussed and agreement is sought , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We &apos;re adults , not children . 
Italian politicians have been discussing reforms to their post-war constitution for 15 years but without real progress . 
many commentators hoped the huge corruption scandals that felled the old ruling elite in the early 1990s would bring swift reform but little has been done . 
Prodi &apos;s government , the 55th since the war , says it has an historic duty to achieve reform . 
&quot; Now we need goodwill , commitment and enthusiam from everyone , &quot; said Senate Speaker Nicola Mancino . 
separatist leader Umberto Bossi , who wants secession for northern Italy , has accused Berlusconi of supporting Prodi in exchange for &quot; who knows what in return &quot; for his media empire . 
&quot; The bi-cameral commission is just about keeping the Prodi government on its feet , it &apos;s got nothing to do with reform , &quot; he said .
