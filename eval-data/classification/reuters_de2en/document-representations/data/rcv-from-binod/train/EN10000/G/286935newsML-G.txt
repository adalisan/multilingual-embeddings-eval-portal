German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , the first western leader to see President Boris Yeltsin since his heart operation , said after talks near Moscow on Saturday he expected Russia and the West to settle their dispute over NATO expansion this year . 
&quot; There are still some differences of opinion , &quot; Kohl told a news conference , referring to Russia &apos;s strong objections to plans to grant membership of the western defence alliance to former Soviet-bloc states in eastern Europe . 
&quot; But we evaluated a couple of ideas which I will discuss with my NATO colleagues over the next couple of days on the telephone , &quot; Kohl added , mentioning U.S. President Bill Clinton . 
&quot; I think that this year we will find a rational solution which will make NATO enlargement possible and will at the same time respect the security interests of all partners concerned . 
Yeltsin , whom Kohl described as alert and energetic , said he had agreed to continue discussions on NATO expansion . 
&quot; We sought a settlement of this issue . 
we agreed to continue discussion in the future on the theme &apos; Russia and NATO &apos; , &quot; Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky quoted the Russian leader as saying , according to Interfax and Itar-Tass news agencies . 
Russian policy has appeared to drift for much of the past year , first because of the campaign for last July &apos;s presidential election , when Yeltsin took a hard line in public against NATO expansion , and subsequently due to the president &apos;s illness . 
after a heart bypass operation on November 5 he returned to the Kremlin a fortnight ago but has scarcely appeared in public . 
in television film of Kohl &apos;s arrival , he looked tired but pleased to see the chancellor , whom he views as a close friend . 
Western leaders , now queuing up to meet Yeltsin , see his return as a chance to settle a long-running quarrel over NATO expansion , which Moscow sees as a threat to its security as well as a humiliating proof of its decline from superpower status . 
French President Jacques Chirac is due in Moscow this month and Yeltsin will meet Clinton in March . 
Kohl said Yeltsin would also visit The Hague on February 4 for talks with Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok , the current president of the European Union . 
Kohl , however , hopes his special relationship with Yeltsin and Germany &apos;s close ties to Russia -- it is Moscow &apos;s biggest creditor -- can get the new diplomatic year off to a good start in the approach to a deal on NATO expansion 
&quot; I am glad , Helmut , that we are opening the New Year &apos;s international calendar with this meeting , &quot; Yeltsin told him . 
underlining the warmth of relations between the two men , who last met just three months ago , the Russian president accepted an invitation to Germany in April , where among other things he will accept a &quot; Man of the Year &quot; award in Baden-Baden . 
meeting at the Rus hunting lodge , some 100 km ( 60 miles ) west of Moscow , the two leaders agreed to work together ahead of the next meeting of the Group of Seven ( G7 ) rich nations and Russia , scheduled for Denver , Colorado in June , and to reduce bureaucratic obstacles to bilateral trade and economic ties . 
Kohl was reluctant to comment on Yeltsin &apos;s health but said he seemed energetic and mentally sharp , showing a full grasp of the issues with a minimum of briefing materials . 
many western analysts say Russia is reconciled to the first wave of NATO enlargement -- likely to include Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic -- but wants to drive a hard bargain . 
NATO members have agreed to issue invitations in July for the first former Soviet bloc countries to join the alliance , and at the same time give Russia a role in shaping Europe &apos;s defence .
