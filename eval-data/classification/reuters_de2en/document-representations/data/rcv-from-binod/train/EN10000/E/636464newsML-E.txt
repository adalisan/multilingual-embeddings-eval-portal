Bulgaria &apos;s currency board system , due to be launched next month to stabilise the crumbling economy , faces serious challenges from a high budget deficit and an overvalued fixed Lev / mark exchange rate economists said . 
the government agreed with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) on Tuesday on a package in which this year &apos;s budget deficit would be equal to 6.2 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) . 
this is higher than the 3.8 percent intially recommended by the fund . 
it also announced that the Lev would be fixed at 1,000 to the German mark once the currency board is in place . 
&quot; Success of the currency board will depend on how soon confidence in the banks is restored , on privatisation and fiscal discipline , &quot; said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell emerging market analyst Stuart Parkinson in Frankfurt . 
&quot; I think that financing the budget deficit is potentially a challange for the government given they do not want to increase significantly the domestic debt burden , &quot; said David Boren , who is vice president of emerging markets research at Salomon Brothers in London . 
other analysts warned that the high budget deficit could fuel inflation and raise interest rates , but local economists echoed the government &apos;s insistence that the budget deficit was higher but sustainable . 
&quot; Given the expectations of continuing economic decline in the short-term , the low budget deficit was unrealistic . 
you cannot collect high revenues in a shrinking economy , &quot; said Bulgarian Investment Bank economist Galina Dimitrova . 
up to 3.4 percent of the deficit is expected to be funded from privatisation proceeds , said Finance Minister Muravei Radev . 
but the new reformist government needs to leap into sell-offs to compensate for previous governments &apos; reluctance to sell . 
&quot; We want to see privatisation making more progress in selling state-owned companies , particularly the &apos; crown jewels &apos; , &quot; said Parkinson . 
Bulgaria has fallen behind on promises to the World Bank to privatise 25 percent of state assets under an agreement signed last year . 
only 18.5 percent of assets have been sold off so far . 
a World Bank mission is due to arrive in Sofia in the second half of June to evaluate Bulgaria &apos;s performance under an agreement which has earmarked about $ 280 million for Bulgaria . 
further tranches from a $ 510 million IMF standby agreement also hinge on Bulgaria meeting World Bank restructuring targets . 
&quot; The Lev / mark peg rate is ( at ) a too strong level , &quot; said ING Bank emerging markets economist Parvoleta Shtereva in London . 
she echoed worries among other economists that an overvalued Lev would hinder production and exports , and stimulate imports . 
this would result in a high trade deficit and slower economic growth . 
Bulgarian Academy of Sciences estimates showed that at the time of introduction the Lev rate should be between 1,300 and 1,400 to the mark . 
but Boren regarded the fixed rate as reasonable . 
&quot; We can expect up to three months of stability , unless privatisation speeds up over the summer . 
financing the budget deficit is going to require interest rates to go up , which may undermine awaited stability , &quot; said an economist who declined to be named . 
high yields now and expectations for low exchange rate risk under the currency board sytem has attracted around $ 130 million in investment in government paper from foreign investors in the past several months , a finance ministry official told Reuters . 
&quot; I expect interest rates to fluctuate around lower than current levels after the currency board is introduced , &quot; said Plamen Oresharski , who is head of the ministry &apos;s Treasury and Debt Department . 
the average yield to maturity on four-week government paper auctioned since Friday ranged between 3.81 and 3.69 percent . 
the draft budget still needs to be passed by the cabinet and parliament by the end of the month , before the currency board system is launched on July 1 . 
under the system all levs in circulation must be fully covered by foreign exchange reserves of around $ 1 billion . 
the 1,000 Lev / mark peg also comes in effect from July 1 . 
despite future pitfalls , Radev remained optimistic . 
&quot; We have all reasons to successfully introduce and sustain the currency board arrangement , &quot; he told reporters .
