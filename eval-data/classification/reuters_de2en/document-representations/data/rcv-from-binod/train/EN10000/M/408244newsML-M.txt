European stock markets quietly ignored warnings from the U.S. central bank chief on Thursday , continuing their upward run after only the briefest of pauses for breath . 
the French and German bourses gained around one percent on their blue chip indices by mid morning , while London again was more cautious , as investors largely reacted to domestic factors . 
the dollar was mixed , falling against the yen but holding stable against the mark . 
U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan , who sent stock markets plunging across the globe late last year when he warned investors against irrational exuberance , proved less influential this time . 
on Wednesday he warned of excessive optimism over the U.S. economy , telling a Senate committee that caution was especially warranted due to the sharp rise in U.S. equity prices in the last two years . 
his remarks gave Wall Street a bumpy ride , with the Dow Jones Industrial average closing down 55 points at 6,983 . 
but European markets were already losing interest by Wednesday &apos;s close after brief dips and ignored Greenspan completely on Thursday . 
&quot; There were no real surprises in what Greenspan said , &quot; said one London dealer . 
&quot; He is not a man who likes to be ignored and he has just reiterated what he said back in November . 
French and German shares led the way at mid-morning , with the Paris CAC-40 up 0.9 percent or 23.72 points at 2,625.89 , less than 10 points below the all-time high hit earlier this month . 
French investors were more interested in good data on the troubled domestic economy than Greenspan . 
GDP rose 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996 after a revised 0.8 percent rise in the third quarter , giving full-year growth of 1.3 percent . 
&quot; After Greenspan &apos;s statements and the drop on Wall Street , we were bracing for a decline today . 
but the GDP is a positive surprise , &quot; a Paris broker said . 
German shares likewise flirted with record levels , with the DAX up over one percent at 3,272.52 , less than four points shy of the all-time high . 
London staged a less spectacular performance , with the FTSE up just 5.8 points at 4,335.1 . 
again dealers were unimpressed by Greenspan , who also hinted that U.S. interest rates might have to rise to nip any inflation in the bud . 
good results from the current reporting season held &quot; I think interest rates in the U.S will be going up , perhaps in the second quarter , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; But a muted response from us was probably right ... why should we walk away from London in the middle of our results season ? 
a parliamentary by-election on Thursday , in which the ruling Conservatives are expected to lose to the opposition Labour Party , is unlikely to depress stocks . 
some traditionally pro-Conservative investors would actually prefer a clear-cut Labour win to reduce the chance of no party winning decisively in the general election which has to be held by May . 
&quot; A Conservative win would raise fears of a hung parliament at the general election and would impact on markets . 
the dollar started European trade on a weak note against the yen , dragged down to its session lows by a sudden selloff of marks for yen overnight . 
weakness in mark / yen has combined with continued fears that Japanese corporations will make huge dollar sales for seasonal accounting reasons to spook the market , analysts said . 
but the dollar recovered a little from an early low of 120.36 yen to reach 121.18 , albeit well below its late Wednesday European level of 122.15 . 
it was also at 1.6918 marks , slightly up from 1.6895 in 
late European trading on Wednesday . 
the mark &apos;s weakness , triggered by mark / yen sales by U.S. funds overnight , took the mark down to 71.54 yen , its lowest since June 1996 . 
analysts said that market operators were unwilling to sell either dollars or yen as sentiment was strong in both -- the former due Greenspan comments on pre-empting inflation and the latter due to Japanese fund repatration before the March 31 financial year-end . 
the dollar was quoted at 1.6918 marks and 121.18 yen , compared with 1.6895 and 122.15 in late European trade on Wednesday . 
gold was at fixed in the morning at $ 356.60 compared with $ 353.85 at the London close on Wednesday . 
silver was one cent higher at $ 5.24 .
