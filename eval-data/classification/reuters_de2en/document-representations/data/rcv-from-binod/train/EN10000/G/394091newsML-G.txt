Chinese police on Friday detained a man in Beijing &apos;s Tiananmen Square as he carried a wreath apparently dedicated to late patriarch Deng Xiaoping , witnesses said . 
between 20 and 30 plainclothes police rushed up to the unidentified man as he walked from a subway entrance towards the Martyrs &apos; monument in the square . 
he was bundled into a car along with the wreath , on which the words &quot; Deng Xiaoping &quot; were written on a ribbon , a witness said . 
no further details were available on the incident , which was an indication of heightened security in the politically sensitive square following the death of China &apos;s paramount leader Deng on Wednesday evening . 
Tiananmen Square was the focus of huge student-led protests crushed by the military on June 4 , 1989 , in a crackdown ordered by Deng . 
a funeral ceremony for Deng is scheduled to be held in the Great Hall of the People next to the square on Tuesday .
