the two Brent cargoes nominated from the paper chains on Tuesday were both kept ahead of the five o &apos;clock deadline , traders said . 
the cargoes , loading Feb 12-14 , were kept by Stasco , they said . 
Brent cargoes are traded on a paper , or forward , market until the 1700 London time deadline on the nearest trading day 15 days before their assigned loading date . 
a trading company is five o &apos;clocked when they are left with a paper cargo which has turned physical after that deadline and thus cannot be passed on as part of a chain of pre-sold paper cargo deals .
