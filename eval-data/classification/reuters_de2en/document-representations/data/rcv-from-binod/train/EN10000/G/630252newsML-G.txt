Bulgarian police said on Monday they had launched a lightning swoop on property owned by customs officers stationed at border check-points , as part of a fight against rampant corruption and organised crime . 
a ministry statement said police had investigated over the weekend the property of some 1,000 customs officers at 49 border crossings , including 883 luxury limousines owned by modestly-paid customs officers . 
the investigators checked whether the vehicles , land , huge houses and hard currency were lawfully owned . 
&quot; A large proportion of customs officers have modern and new limousines and live in luxurious conditions , &quot; the statement said . 
officials say the traffic of stolen cars through Bulgaria is huge , many vehicles being reexported to Moldova , Ukraine and other ex-Soviet republics or Macedonia , Albania and Yugoslavia . 
police on Monday also launched checks on firms operating in Bulgaria &apos;sinistry statement said hotels , restaurants , night clubs , shops and gambling houses had been inspected in the three biggest resorts in the north of the country &apos;s coastal strip .
