Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak headed to Washington on Friday with an eye on securing a more active U.S. role in the troubled Middle East peace process and reaping economic benefits for his country &apos;s emerging economy . 
Mubarak &apos;s visit comes at a time of increasing tension between Israel and its Arab neighbours , who believe the Jewish state is jeopardising peace talks with a number of unilateral decisions on contentious issues . 
the Egyptian leader &apos;s visit to Washington this year also takes place , as it did in 1996 , close on the heels of talks in Cairo with right-wing Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu . 
Mubarak made it clear during both sets of talks that he feared Netanyahu &apos;s policies threatened the future of the peace process and he may bank on recent but rare U.S. criticism of Israel to secure President Bill Clinton &apos;s support . 
the United States , Israel &apos;s biggest ally and sponsor of the peace process , last week joined an international chorus of disapproval over Israel &apos;s decision to build a Jewish neighbourhood in Arab East Jerusalem . 
the future of Jerusalem is to be decided , along with other difficult issues , in &quot; final status &quot; talks expected to resume between Israel and the Palestinians later this month . 
&quot; President Mubarak should be expected to ask the American president to play a more active role to end the leave of absence that started before the U.S. elections . 
the elections are over so it &apos;s time to play an active role , &quot; said Ibrahim Karawan , head of the Middle East programme at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London . 
many in the Arab world believed Clinton toned down U.S. involvement in the peace process to concentrate on domestic politics and to avoid angering the influential Jewish lobby during his successful campaign for re-election last November . 
&quot; We are entering the stage in which negotiations are to take place about the most difficult issues in the Arab-Israeli conflict such as Jerusalem , refugees , water and borders . 
these are the core issues and they made the conflict last as long as it did , &quot; Karawan told Reuters . 
but how large a role the United States is willing to play is questionable , Karawan said . 
&quot; I have doubts that this U.S. administration will play an active role if that means exerting tangible pressure on Israel . 
beyond the verbal level I doubt the American administration will exert effective leverage over Israel , &quot; he said . 
Mubarak , whose country became in 1979 the first Arab state to make peace with Israel , has not always agreed with Clinton &apos;s solutions to sticky issues in the peace talks . 
he turned down an invitation to an emergency peace summit in Washington in October after Netanyahu opened a tourist tunnel entrance near Islamic shrines in Jerusalem . 
Clinton gathered Netanyahu , Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and King Hussein of Jordan in an attampt to cool the tension after 61 Palestinians and 15 Israelis died in gun battles after the tunnel opening . 
Mubarak said he stayed away because he was displeased with Israel &apos;s attitude towards the Palestinians and Egyptian officials at the time faulted the United States for its policy of short-term pacification . 
Egypt is also keen to promote the Syrian track of the peace process . 
talks between Syria and Israel were suspended while Israel still had a Labour government last year . 
Damascus says it is willing to resume the talks as long as they start from where they left off , but Israel refuses to accept what it considers preconditions . 
Mubarak &apos;s stopover in Paris before his Washington visit may be significant to some as Egypt and many Arabs have encouraged a greater European role in the peace process to offset what they see as the pro-Israeli bias of the United States . 
politics aside , Mubarak is taking a business delegation with him to the United States in the hope of attracting lucrative deals for his country &apos;s growing econonmy . 
Egypt has embarked on a successful privatisation programme and has a keen eye on foreign investment . 
Mubarak and U.S. Vice President Al Gore have set up a lobbying group called the President &apos;s Council which aims to promote the private sector .
