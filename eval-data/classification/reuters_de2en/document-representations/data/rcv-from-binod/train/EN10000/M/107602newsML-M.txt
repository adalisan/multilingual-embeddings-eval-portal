the Bradford wool market saw an increase in buying interest after a very slow start to the week but there was little evidence of a corresponding increase in firm contracts , brokers reported on Thursday . 
resistance to price rises by retail buyers continues to hold the market in thrall and most values were unchanged , they said . 
demand was patchy , particularly from the machine-knit sector , they added . 
some topmakers reported an improvement in the rate of deliveries , largely within the domestic market , but with softening prices and weaker demand at Wednesday &apos;s raw wool sale , the general outlook remained bearish . 
&quot; Over the past twelve months , similar weak market spells were followed by recoveries which in turn failed to follow through and there is a wariness now , &quot; one source said .
