the New Zealand dollar kept its head above 70 U.S. cents at Friday &apos;s close after dipping below mid-afternoon but dealers said sentiment was ugly . 
&quot; It &apos;s pretty bearish , &quot; said one dealer . 
there were a combination of factors bearing down on the kiwi -- uncertainty about which parties will form the government , comments from Reserve Bank Governor Don brash on Thursday that the kiwi was near the top of its cycle and international sentiment against dollar bloc currencies . 
the kiwi was at US $ 0.7000 / 07 at 5.30 p.m. compared with its 0.7023 / 30 opening while the Trade-Weighted Index ended at 66.50 from its 66.83 opening . 
dollar currencies were being sold heavily after comments from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan about irrational exuberance in U.S. asset markets . 
however , locally comments from brash and uncertainty about which way NZ First leans when it choses a coaltion partner weighted most on the kiwi . 
NZ First holds the balance of power and is in the final stages of decided between the caretaker National government and the left-leaning Labour Party . 
dealers said there was initial support for the kiwi at 0.6980 and then at 0.6950 but if that was breached then the floodgates would open . 
dealers said that which there had been some exporter interest to buy there was also hefty selling from big name U.S. traders .
