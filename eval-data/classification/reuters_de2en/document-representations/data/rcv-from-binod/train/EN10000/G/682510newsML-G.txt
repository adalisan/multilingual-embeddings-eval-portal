a fragile truce , condition for deployment of a planned African intervention force , held in the Congo Republic capital Brazzaville on Tuesday despite a brief burst of shellfire , witnesses said . 
U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun , speaking after a summit of West African Francophone countries rallied behind the idea of a force , said that host Togo was sounding out its neighbours in the region on who would take part . 
&quot; The most urgent and important thing to induce the protagonists to stop fighting , to cease fire and also to commit themselves to negotiations to find a solution to this problem , &quot; Sahnoun told Radio France International in an interview . 
this , he said , would permit the creation of a force to &quot; encourage the protagonists to begin and follow through and conclude these negotiations &quot; . 
Togo and Senegal , who have troops in a similar force in the embattled capital of the neighbouring Central African Republic , have already said they would take part in a Brazzaville force . 
Brazzaville &apos;s mayor Bernard Kolelas , mediating between supporters of President Pascal Lissouba and those of former military leader Denis Sassou Nguesso , pressed on with his efforts by assembling politicians in Bacongo , a southern suburb he controls . 
his mediation nearly ran aground on Monday when two shells slammed into houses near Bacongo market , wounding six people and prompting the French ambassador to say he believed someone was trying to sabotage the peace efforts . 
the shells were fired during a 90-minute artillery duel that risked dragging neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo , formerly Zaire , into the conflict when seven shells landed near its capital Kinshasa . 
the truce has dampened fighting that raged for 12 days in the former French colonial capital Brazzaville , killing an estimated 1,000 people . 
Sahnoun said even more might have died . 
no day has gone by without some firing , but Monday &apos;s battle was the worst breach so far since the truce took effect on June 17 . 
the truce is due to last until the weekend . 
Sahnoun said after the summit of eight west African states in Togo a force of an initial 1,600-1,800 men could be deployed rapidly in Brazzaville , across the Congo River from Kinshasa . 
mediators want the intervention force to help restore order so that democratic presidential elections that were to have been held on July 27 can go ahead -- at a later date . 
Brazzaville descended into warfare on June 5 when government forces surrounded Sassou Nguesso &apos;s home as part of a crackdown on private militia . 
until the flare-up , the sleepy city of a million had seemed like a haven of peace to people across the river in teeming Kinshasa , who had feared their own war as Laurent Kabila &apos;s rebels neared the city in May to finish off the rule of the now exiled Mobutu Sese Seko . 
Kabila &apos;s foreign minister said he believed Kinshasa had been deliberately targeted in Monday &apos;s shelling , which state television said wounded one man in the former Zaire . 
&quot; We could tell precisely where they were fired from , &quot; Bizima Karaha said , without identifying the guilty party . 
he gave a &quot; final warning &quot; that the country would defend itself if there were any further such incidents .
