a leader of the extreme-right National Front party on Sunday denied telling a U.S. newspaper that immigrants &quot; pollute &quot; French identity -- a remark that outraged anti-racism groups . 
Bruno Megret , deputy to Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen , said his remarks had been mistranslated . 
the New York Times quoted him on February 12 as saying the party wanted to send Arabs , Africans and Asians home &quot; because they pollute our national identity and take our jobs &quot; . 
&quot; I said that immigration calls our national identity into question , &quot; Megret said . 
&quot; It came back to France as &apos; polluting &apos; our national identity . 
&quot; I wonder why French journalists have to go to articles that appeared abroad to inform the French people , &quot; he said . 
Megret &apos;s wife Catherine became the fourth National Front mayor last month by winning municipal elections in the southern town of Vitrolles . 
last week , the French League against Racism and Anti-Semitism ( LICRA ) said it was taking legal action against Megret for racial defamation over his comments in the New York Times , also printed in the International Herald Tribune . 
Megret , calling the Front the &quot; great alternative &quot; to mainstream parties , said the party wanted to enter the National Assembly &quot; massively &quot; in elections in a year &apos;s time . 
Le Pen won 15 percent of the vote in 1995 presidential elections but the party has no seats in parliament .
