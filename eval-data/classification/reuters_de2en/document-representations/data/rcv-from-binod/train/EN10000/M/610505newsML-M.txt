a one-U.S. cent sell-off in the Australian dollar inspired a softer close for the New Zealand dollar on Friday , but the Trade-Weighted Index compensated due to resulting strength on the NZ / Australian dollar cross . 
kiwi closed at US $ 0.6915 / 20 and against its 0.6927 / 34 opening , having been sold down to a low of 0.6895 after Australia cut official rates by half a percentage point . 
but the kiwi fared better on the Trade-Weighted Index , finishing at 67.54 from its 67.37 start . 
the currency had found exporter and interbank support at its lower levels and dealers were left with the impression that the shift lower was largely unjustified , particularly from an kiwi / Aussie interest rate perspective . 
but most of the day &apos;s business was transacted around 0.6910-35 and traders expected a similar range over the weekend .
