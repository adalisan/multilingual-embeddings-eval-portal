the publisher of Zaire &apos;s opposition daily Le Palmares was detained on Friday for alleged publication of false stories about ailing President Mobutu Sese Seseko , his lawyer said . 
Michel Luya was being held at Kinshasa &apos;s Makala prison , lawyer Richard Bondo told Reuters . 
the lawyer said Luya had been charged with publishing false stories in connection with two articles . 
one was a reprint of a foreign press report saying Mobutu had another operation in Europe in January following one for prostate cancer in August , 
Le Palmares also criticised the president &apos;s reorganisation of the army to fight back advancing Rwandan-backed rebels under the headline , &quot; Mobutu &apos;s deceitful decrees &quot; . 
Bondo said Luya denied charges of false publication . 
Mobutu , who has ruled Zaire for 31 years , spent four months in Europe in 1996 on chemotherapy after undergoing prostate surgery in Switzerland in late August . 
he returned to the South of France for medical examinations last week after only three weeks in Zaire .
