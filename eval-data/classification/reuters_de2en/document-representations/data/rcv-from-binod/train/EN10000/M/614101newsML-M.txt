Indian call money ended Monday at 4.75-5.0 percent , marginally down from the weekend close of 5.0-5.25 percent in conditions of good liquidity , dealers said . 
they said supply of funds was good on inflows over the past few days and further inflows were expected in the next few days . 
&quot; About 17 billion rupees came in during the last three days through interest payments on government securities and redemption of securities which had matures , &quot; said a dealer at a state-run bank . 
he said there was little likelihood of call money rising sharply despite a bond auction slated for May 28 . 
the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) auctions 30 billion rupees of three-year central government bonds on Wednesday . 
&quot; immediately after the auction , call money may rise on sentiment , &quot; the dealer said . 
&quot; But with liquidity as good as it is , rates should not rise much above 6.0 percent . 
dealers said heavy spot-dollar purchases by RBI on Monday will also add to domestic liquidity . 
they estimated RBI purchases on Monday to be between $ 150 million and $ 300 million as it intervened to stem the rupee &apos;s rise against the US currency . 
the Indian rupee ended Monday at 35.78 / 79 per dollar against the weekend close of 35.75 / 755 . 
&quot; This ( purchase ) will inject rupees into the system on Wednesday and should balance the outflows to some extent , &quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank . 
prices of government securities were largely steady in dull trade , dealers said . 
they said there was selling pressure as traders sought to raise funds to participate in the bond auction but trade was poor as there were few buyers . 
&quot; Most market players are keeping funds aside for the auction , &quot; said a dealer . 
&quot; Fresh positions will be taken only after the auction . 
dealers said the 13.40 percent 1999 government stock traded on Monday at 104.35 rupees against its last traded 104.61 , the 13.85 percent 2000 stock improved to 105.43 from 105.35 while the 13.85 percent 2001 was traded at 104.60 against 104.55 . 
dealers said the January 1 , 1998 treasury bill was traded at a yield of 9.1 percent .
