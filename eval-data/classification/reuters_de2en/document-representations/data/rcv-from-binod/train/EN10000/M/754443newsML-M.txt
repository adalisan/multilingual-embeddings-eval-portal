live cattle - steady to 0.10 cent down - Product values turned lower late Wednesday while there appears to be some talk that the run-up in futures on Wednesday was overdone . 
there was active trade in the cash market on Wednesday at $ 64 per cwt , steady with the bulk of trade last week . 
little impact seen from cash news as trade at that level was already in the futures market by Wednesday &apos;s close . 
the latest CME feeder cattle index , for July 22 , was down $ 0.05 per cwt at $ 81.99 . 
product prices currently falling sharply while cash hogs expected to be around $ 0.50 to $ 1.00 per cwt lower Thursday . 
cash fresh belly market continues to weaken while there may also be followthrough selling after sharply lower futures close Wednesday .
