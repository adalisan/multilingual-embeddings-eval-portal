volatile currencies turned the UK grains futures market on its head for the second day running on Wednesday . 
futures started lower as sterling made gains against the mark but later losses of 0.80 to 0.25 stg in wheat at the end of the morning session turned into rally of between 0.80 and 0.25 stg at the close as sterling fell back . 
it was a similer story for barley with early losses of 0.60 stg changed to gains of 0.65 to 0.90 stg by the close . 
turnovers were 335 for wheat and 125 for barley . 
on the cash markets traders where reluctant to take fresh positions . 
&quot; These isn &apos;t much grain coming forward from the farms and with currency so volatile people don &apos;t see the point in sticking their necks out to take fresh positions , &quot; said one trader . 
no business was reported on the fob market and only few light loads changed hands on the delivered market . 
Amsterdam mill wheat futures were again negelectd .
