strong gasoline prices at the pump during the thanksgiving holiday weekend and refinery strikes in Europe pushed gasoline futures to contract highs Monday , the first day of trading since last Wednesday . 
gasoline prices surged on the New York Mercantile Exchange , boosted by strength in the cash market and the refinery strikes , which threatened to decrease supply , traders said . 
&quot; The gasoline cash market continues to look strong , plus the strike at Elf Aquitaine is helping prices , &quot; said Warren Tashnek , vice president at Fimat USA futures in Houston . 
a strike by workers at three refineries of the French oil giant Elf Aquitaine entered its fifth day . 
the struck plants account for one-fourth of French capacity and three-fourths of Elf &apos;s European refining network . 
NYMEX gasoline for January delivery closed up 2.66 cents at 68.12 cents per gallon after peaking during trading at a contract high of 68.20 . 
gasoline &apos;s strength pulled crude oil and heating oil higher , with January crude oil up $ 1.05 at $ 24.80 per barrel and January heating oil up 1.89 cents at 73.57 cents per gallon . 
charges of oil smuggling by Iraq may have given crude prices an extra boost , traders said . 
a United Nations committee is to review the smuggling allegations Tuesday . 
in other trading , prices on New York cocoa and coffee futures markets , which were closed late last week , tumbled to catch up with last week &apos;s declines in overseas markets . 
cocoa futures at the Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange ended broadly lower , taking their cue from weakness on the London cocoa market . 
a strike by German confectionary workers helped weigh the market down . 
&quot; The weakness in London made New York move $ 10- $ 15 lower early , but the dollar saved us a little bit , &quot; said one New York trader . 
gradual commercial buying impeded further losses , as did continued strength in the British pound . 
the pound is near a four-year high against the U.S. dollar , which encouraged European manufacturers to buy in the cheaper New York market . 
CSCE traders said they were monitoring the confectionary workers &apos; strike in Germany , a key cocoa-consuming country . 
they warned that the confection industry would be increasingly reluctant to build inventory if the strike persisted . 
CSCE coffee futures ended lower across-the-board in speculative selling largely motivated by lower London coffee , traders said . 
traders and analysts said the sharp decline in London Thursday set Monday &apos;s weak tone . 
London International Financial futures Exchange cocoa futures tumbled to a 31-month low on Thursday , while New York &apos;s CSCE was closed Thursday and Friday for the thanksgiving holiday . 
&quot; The fall in London over the long weekend caused the lower opening , &quot; one analyst said . 
March coffee tumbled 1.70 cents to 106.05 cents per pound on the CSCE . 
a bullish construction report lifted Chicago lumber futures to a second consecutive session of limit gains . 
CME lumber futures rose the daily limit of $ 10.00 per 1,000 board feet for the second straight day , with Monday &apos;s gains boosted by news of robust U.S. construction spending . 
the Commerce Department reported that October construction spending rose 1.8 percent , the largest one-month increase since March . 
CME January lumber finished up the limit at $ 402.20 per 1,000 board feet . 
on Tuesday , the CME limit will expand to $ 15.00 , which is routine after two consecutive sessions of limit gains .
