Sierra Leone &apos;s coup leaders will accept deployment of U.N. and West African peacekeepers to disarm combatants and ensure security under any peace deal in the war-weary country , a senior military source said on Monday . 
the source , a member of the Armed Forces Ruling Council ( AFRC ) running the West African nation since a May 25 coup , told Reuters they had had regular meetings with parliamentarians who put forward a 10-point plan and were close to agreement . 
he said conclusion of a deal would open the way for a national conference on the future of the country , which has suffered three coups in five years , but added that some of the junior officers who staged the coup had misgivings . 
&quot; We are willing to allow the stationing of U.N. and ECOMOG peacekeeping forces in Sierra Leone to monitor the peace accord ( when one is agreed ) and to disarm combatants and ensure stability , &quot; the source said . 
ECOMOG is the Nigerian-led West African force which deployed in neighbouring Liberia to end seven years of civil war there . 
&quot; We are discussing with the former parliamentarians about revoking the decree issued by the AFRC which banned the constitution , &quot; he added , hinting at a possible deal on restoration of political activity . 
but he said junior officers who staged the coup had misgivings about some elements of a deal with civilian politicians and that senior military officers were trying to persuade them to accept it . 
the junior officers toppled elected civilian president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah on May 25 . 
they have accused him of humiliating the army , inciting tribalism and blocking peace with rebels , who took up arms in 1991 , rallied to the coup and have flooded into the capital . 
the civilian politicians and Sierra Leone &apos;s West African neighbours insist that Kabbah be reinstated , something the coup leaders have rejected . 
&quot; The idea of trying to bring back Tejan Kabbah as president meant that they were not interested in peace , &quot; the source said of the politicians , adding that early acceptance of the peacekeeping idea would have borne fruit by now . 
Nigerian gunboats bombarded the capital Freetown in a show of force on June 2 and dissident soldiers and rebels attacked Nigerian soldiers there under a defence accord . 
the United States , France , Lebanon and other nations evacuated their own and other foreign nationals . 
the source accused a militia formed from Kamajor traditional hunters of blocking the highway to the diamond mining centre of Koidu and said that the army was mobilising to dislodge them . 
truck drivers confirmed the report of the road being blocked . 
Kabbah used the Kamajor , who far outnumber the army , to help flush out rebels . 
having driven rebels back to the eastern border , they alliance between the army and the Kamajors broke down into feuding between the two sides . 
the coup leaders offered the Kamajors a place in a national unity government , one provision of the civilian politicians &apos; 10-point plan . 
Kamajor leaders rejected the idea . 
the plan calls for restoration of democratic institutions and the constitution , respect for a peace deal which Kabbah signed with rebel leader Foday Sankoh , addressing the grievances of the army and an amnesty for those involved in the coup and providing a role for the rebels . 
Kabbah took office in March 1996 after multi-party polls , held in spite of the civil war , ended four years of army rule .
