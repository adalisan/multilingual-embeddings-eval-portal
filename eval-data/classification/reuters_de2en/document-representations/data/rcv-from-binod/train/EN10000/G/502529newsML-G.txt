Mexico &apos;s ruling party picked 32 candidates for the July 6 Senate race , including a former interior minister and the official government spokesman , but no current cabinet members . 
the selection was closely watched to see if any cabinet members would quit their posts to run for the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( pri ) in a bid to qualify as possible presidential candidates in 2000 . 
but the list of 32 , including 11 women , was headed by former Interior Minister Esteban Moctezuma , who left his post in June 1995 and later became one of the pri &apos;s top officials . 
it also included government spokesman Dionisio Perez Jacome , two labour leaders , Beatriz Paredes and Elba Esther Gordillo , and the head of the government &apos;s peace negotiating team in the southern state of Chiapas , Marco Antonio Bernal . 
Perez Jacome and Bernal both work under the current hardline Interior Minister Emilio Chauyffet . 
his ministry was embroiled in controversy this week after it sent to Reforma newspaper a campaign speech by Chauyffet &apos;s ex-Deputy Minister , Arturo Nunez , who is running as a pri candidate in the southeastern state of Tabasco . 
government ministries are supposed to stay out of party politics , though they often give thinly-veiled support to the pri , which has ruled Mexico for 68 years . 
the Interior Ministry official who sent the speech was fired . 
in the run-up to the naming of the candidates , newspapers had speculated that top cabinet members , such as Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria , would run for Senate . 
the mid-term elections in July are expected to be among the toughest elections ever for the pri , with opposition parties gaining ground across the country . 
whatever happens , the ruling party will hold its almost seven-decade-old Senate majority , however , because only a quarter of the seats in the upper house will be contested .
