spot power prices in the western U.S. dipped slightly Tuesday as the weather moderated and nuclear plants in the Southwest resumed full operations . 
&quot; offers are down today , while bids are pretty much unchanged , &quot; said one trade source . 
he cited the return to full power Monday of the 1,080 megawatt ( MW ) unit 3 at the San Onofre nuclear plant and the 1,087 MW Diablo Canyon unit 1 in California as well as the 90-percent rate posted early Tuesday by the 1,221 MW unit 1 at Palo Verde in Arizona as putting downward pressure on prices . 
market sources said the outage Monday night of the 720 megawatt unit 4 at the Four corners coal-fired power plant in New Mexico was having little impact on spot prices . 
a spokesman for Arizona Public Service Co , which operates Four corners , said the unit was shut to correct a boiler tube leak and likely would not be back up until next Monday . 
&quot; The coal units that have been down don &apos;t displace the nukes that are coming back , &quot; said another trader . 
sources also said milder temperatures have put a damper on spot electricity as well as natural gas prices . 
&quot; In the Northwest , the daily temperatures are not high , but the lows are about five degrees ( F ) above normal , &quot; said one trade source . 
the continued lack of surplus power offers from the Bonneville Power Administration did little to support the spot market . 
&quot; If they were in the market , prices would probably be lower , &quot; noted one trader . 
Next-day firm on-peak quotes for California-Oregon border ( COB ) power were $ 24.00-25.00 per megawatt hour ( MWh ) , down from $ 24.50-25.50 on Monday . 
Mid-Columbia was last quoted $ 22.00-23.00 , down from $ 22.50-23.50 . 
at Palo Verde , firm on-peak power for Wednesday was quoted $ 21.00-23.00 , little changed from Monday . 
four corners was assessed at $ 21.00-23.00 , down from $ 22.00-25.00 .
