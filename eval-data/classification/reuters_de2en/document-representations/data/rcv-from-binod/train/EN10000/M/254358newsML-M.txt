Naphtha prices held steady in quiet trade on Friday , traders said . 
they expected the market to remain subject to , but lagging behind , fluctuations in crude with little impetus to push the market either way next week . 
&quot; effectively the market is balanced to long , but it &apos;s illiquid with few buyers and no aggressive sellers &quot; , one trader said . 
traders expected some buying for top-up parcels to persist but most players are thought covered to the end of the year if not through to mid-Jan . 
some interest for pipeline spec was seen on Friday with one trading house bidding $ 218 a tonne but offers were scarce . 
otherwise best bids were pegged around Jan swaps levels at $ 215- $ 216 a tonne CIF NWE .
