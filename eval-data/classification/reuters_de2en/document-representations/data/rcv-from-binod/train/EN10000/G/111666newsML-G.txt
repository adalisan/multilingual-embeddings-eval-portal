- A would-be robber who thought Courtney Beswick , blind since birth , looked like easy pickings paid for his mistake with his life when Beswick used martial arts training to throw his attacker to the ground . 
when police reached the corner of Wayne Avenue and 51st street in the Germantown section on Wednesday night , Beswick , 28 , was standing over a prostrate man . 
the man was taken to the Medical College of Pennsylvania hospital where he was pronounced dead . 
Jim Pauley said Beswick told police &quot; he was grabbed from behind and pushed up against a wall . 
then he flipped him and they struggled on the ground . 
Beswick used a neck hold to subdue his assailant . 
police have not released the dead man &apos;s identity , pending notification of relatives . 
Beswick was released after questioning , according to Pauley , and will not be charged if no other evidence is uncovered . 
but Pauley said the investigation was still open .
