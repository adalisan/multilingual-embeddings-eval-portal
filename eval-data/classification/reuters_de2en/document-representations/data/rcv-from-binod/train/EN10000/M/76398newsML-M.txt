overnight rates on the Jordanian dinar soared on Wednesday to a high 8.00-9.00 percent range after substantial bank transfers to the Central Bank , bankers said . 
bankers said the transfers worth a total of six to 10 million dinars to the Central Bank from lender banks , led by Housing Bank , were behind the sudden upsurge in rates from a narrow 3.50-4.50 percent on Tuesday . 
rates have fluctuated in the low 3.00-5.00 percent range this week with dealers attributing this to lower than expected subscription in the latest 15 million dinar ( $ 21 million ) CD ( certificate of deposits ) issue and start of monthly salary transfers by state ministries .
