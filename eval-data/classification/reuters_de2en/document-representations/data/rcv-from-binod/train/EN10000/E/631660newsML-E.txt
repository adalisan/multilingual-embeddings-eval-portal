the nation &apos;s manufacturing sector expanded at a faster pace in May than in April while prices for raw materials receded , the National Association of Purchasing Management said Monday . 
the group , whose members are responsible for buying goods ranging from steel to silicon for the nation &apos;s factories , said its monthly index rose for the 12th consecutive month in May . 
&quot; The overall picture in May as indicated by an increase in the growth rates of new orders , backlog of orders , and a continued reduction in prices is one of continued growth in manufacturing activity , &quot; said Norbert J. 
ore , chairman of the National Association of Purchasing Management &apos;s Business Survey Committee and director of purchasing at Sonoco Products Co . 
&quot; The rate of growth of new orders is strong while prices are receding , with only five industries reporting that they are paying higher prices . 
the Purchasing Managers &apos; Index rose to 57.1 percent from 54.2 percent in April . 
a reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding , while one below that level indicates it is generally contracting . 
an index reading above 43.9 percent over a period of time generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy . 
&quot; The past relationship between the PMI and the overall economy indicates that the average PMI for the months of January through May ( 54.3 percent ) , if continued for all of 1997 , corresponds to approximately a 3.6 percent ( increase ) in real gross domestic product for 1997 , &quot; Ore said . 
&quot; However , if the PMI for May of 57.1 percent turned out to be the annual average for 1997 , this would correspond to approximately plus 4.6 percent ( increase in real GDP ) , &quot; he said . 
NAPM said its Employment Index rose for the third month after 24 consecutive months of reduction in the manufacturing sector . 
at the same time , its Price Index slipped to 48.4 percent last month , down 1.2 percentage points from April , indicating lower prices for the commodities purchased by manufacturers . 
&quot; Purchasing executives &apos; comments on business conditions were optimistic about the balance of 1997 with specific reference to housing and petroleum-related industries doing well , &quot; Ore added . 
&quot; Many members continued to indicate strength in their markets . 
the group said its production Index gained 0.4 percentage point to 57.0 percent in May . 
more significantly , its New Orders Index rose 6.3 percentage points , from 57.9 percent to 64.2 percent , accompanied by a greater volume of unfilled orders for the third consecutive month . 
industries showing the highest rate of production growth last month , listed in order , were : furniture ; Electronic Components &amp; Equipment ; Miscellaneous ( a preponderance of jewelry , toys , sporting goods , musical instruments ) ; Textiles ; fabricated metals ; Chemicals ; Petroleum ; Industrial &amp; Commercial Equipment &amp; Computers ; Food ; and Transportation &amp; Equipment .
