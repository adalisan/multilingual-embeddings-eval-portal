Brazil &apos;s Roman Catholic Church said on Thursday that a controversial ruling on the demarcation of an Indian reserve was having disastrous consequences for indigenous tribes in the north . 
the Catholic Church &apos;s Indigenous Missionary Council ( CIMI ) said municipal leaders in the Raposa / Serra do Sol reservation in the frontier state of Roraima were planning &quot; illegal &quot; dam projects and were constructing roads on Indian lands . 
justice Minister Nelson Jobim came under attack from indigenous groups last December when he decided to allow five non-Indian municipalities to remain in Raposa / Serra do Sol after its demarcation . 
the constitution states indigenous lands must be vacated by non-Indians . 
CIMI said the Indian Council of Roraima had denounced plans by the town of Uiramuta to build a dam and work already under way by the town of Pacaraima to lay a road through Raposa / Serra do Sol . 
in addition , CIMI said a former leader of the Indian Council of Roraima recently received death threats in the town hall of Normandia . 
&quot; All of this has resulted from the unfortunate ( decision ) of Justice Minister Nelson Jobim , who reshaped and cut back the indigenous area , leaving space for small towns set up by wildcat gold and diamond miners , &quot; CIMI said in a statement . 
pressure groups and indigenous organisations say last year &apos;s Raposa / Serra do Sol decision could set a worrying precedent for dozens of other reservations waiting to be properly demarcated . 
some 11,000 Indians of the Makuxi , Ingariko , Wapixana , Taurepang and Patamona tribes live on Raposa &apos;s 4.0 million acres ( 1.6 million hectares ) . 
clashes between Indians using bows and arrows and armed outsiders are common .
