blue-chip stocks , bonds and the dollar fell on Tuesday as investors took profits amid uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again next week . 
the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 18.54 points at 7,274.21 , after a rally to 7,315.83 briefly beat out Monday &apos;s record close of 7,292.75 . 
in the broader market , declining issues led advances 1,325 to 1,135 on active volume of 489 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
the selling stemmed from a report that the Fed is likely to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point at its policy-setting meeting next week . 
&quot; There is a very good chance the Fed will do another 25 basis points ( one-quarter percentage point ) , and virtually no chance it will do 50 basis points , &quot; one source at the Fed told Reuters . 
the Federal Open Market Committee raised the funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 5.50 percent in March in an effort to ward off inflation . 
&quot; I &apos;m impressed -- we &apos;ve got multiple excuses to pull out the rug from under the Dow . 
it &apos;s acting very well considering the circumstances , &quot; said Alfred Goldman , chief market analyst for A.G. Edwards &amp; sons . 
the last increase in interest rates set the stage for a sell-off that wiped out nearly 700 points from the blue-chip Dow index . 
&quot; They could easily justify one more rate hike but not a series of rate hikes . 
we still don &apos;t see the whites of inflation &apos;s eyes yet , &quot; said Anthony Chan , chief economist for Banc One . 
Chan said considering the headstrong gains made by the market in the past few weeks , he did not believe that stocks have fully anticipated the possibility of a rate increase . 
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell nearly half a point , raising its yield to 6.93 percent from Monday &apos;s 6.89 percent . 
the bond &apos;s price and yield move in opposite directions . 
in late trading , the dollar fell to 118.67 Japanese yen and 1.6940 German marks from 119.45 yen and 1.7070 marks late Monday . 
coffee prices soared to their highest level since July 1994 as continued worries about tight supplies sent speculators on a buying spree . 
at New York &apos;s Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange , coffee for July delivery rose to a lifetime high of 243.00 cents a pound before slipping back slightly to close at 241.15 cents , up 11.50 cents . 
gasoline settled higher in New York after a blast at a Citgo refinery in Texas disrupted production . 
at the New York Mercantile Exchange , June crude oil settled off 1 cent a barrel at $ 21.37 . 
June heating oil was off 0.17 cent a gallon at 56.48 cents , while June gasoline was up 0.29 cent a gallon at 64.76 cents . 
overseas , London &apos;s FTSE 100 index , up for the 11th straight session , added 21.4 points to close at 4,691.0 . 
in Tokyo , the 225-share Nikkei average ended 14.40 points lower or 0.07 percent at 20,129.11 .
