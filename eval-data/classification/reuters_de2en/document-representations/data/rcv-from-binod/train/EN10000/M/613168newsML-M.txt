Canadian bonds ended the session little changed in very quiet trade on Monday , with the Memorial Day closing of the U.S. market sidelining many investors , analysts said . 
&quot; There &apos;s no indicators . 
there &apos;s no business . 
it &apos;s very , very quiet . 
there &apos;s nothing much interesting to say , &quot; said Mark Chandler , senior economist with Goldman Sachs Canada . 
the U.S. 30-year bond last traded with a yield of 6.99 percent on Friday . 
the spread between the bonds was unchanged at seven basis points . 
&quot; There was nothing going on at all , &quot; said Joe Lee , a portfolio manager with Laketon Investment Management . 
&quot; It &apos;s not unusual for the market to be flat on a day like this . 
while there was no official close announced for the Canadian bond market , dealers said activity was extremely thin with the U.S. market closed for Memorial Day and London observing a banking holiday . 
trading volumes were also low because several brokerages were sponsoring golf tournaments on Monday , keeping many traders from the market . 
looking ahead , dealers said the focus for the week was likely to be new supply in Canada and the United States . 
Canada has a five-year bond auction on Wednesday , while the United States has a two-year note auction on Wednesday and a five-year note auction on Thursday . 
Lee said the market could also see some new issues of corporate bonds . 
the U.S. 10-year bond last traded with a yield of 6.75 percent at the close of trading on Friday . 
the negative spread between the two bonds was 23 basis points , unchanged from the close of trading on Friday . 
the three-month cash T-bill traded with a yield of 2.88 percent against its U.S. equivalent which yielded 5.15 percent .
