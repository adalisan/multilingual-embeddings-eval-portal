metal prices will continue to slumber until the nights start drawing in , after a round of interest rate cuts in Europe failed to excite the market . 
Germany &apos;s Bundesbank made an above-forecast cut in its repo ( securities re-purchase ) rate to three PCT from 3.3 PCT on Thursday , prompting other European central banks to follow . 
&quot; It is welcome as the economy is not gaining much strength ... but it is symptomatic of how weak the economy is , &quot; analyst Robin Bhar of London Metal Exchange ( LME ) trader Brandeis ( brokers ) Ltd said . 
&quot; The Bundesbank rate cut was a surprise and is probably the best news that the market has heard for some time ... it will be a good stimulus for growth , &quot; broker GNI Ltd said in its daily review . 
unsurprisingly , LME prices and sentiment were unmoved by the economic developments , as the non-ferrous metals market is be-devilled by slow summer trading conditions at present . 
&quot; In the very short-term it ( Buba cut ) makes no difference , as nobody wants to take these markets on at the moment . 
long-term -- if it feeds through into offtake , then yes it is positive , &quot; one trader said . 
but even this might take some time to transpire , as the second half of the year is not looking particularly promising so far for metals . 
&quot; The European economies will not do much this year ... we have a global economy that is chugging along at the bottom . 
the U.S. is the only bright spot really , &quot; said Bhar . 
traders are hoping that the end of the summer lull -- a period when manufacturers run down activities for annual maintainance and holidays -- will bring some interest and turnover back on to the LME . 
this is likely to be a few weeks yet , as there are holidays in the UK next Monday and in the U.S. next weekend . 
once these are out of the way end-users will be looking at their likely requirements for the final quarter of 1996 .
