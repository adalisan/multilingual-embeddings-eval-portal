* Market waits for formation of new govt 
new Zealand debt markets ended the week flat on Friday after an uninspired session . 
the 90-day bank bill recovered from its slightly weaker start to end two basis points stronger at 8.78 percent as the currency &apos;s Trade-Weighed Index gained 16 points on Thursday &apos;s closing level . 
however , the December futures contract was a point weaker at 91.52 . 
the cash rate was bumped up slightly , to 9.40 percent from its 9.35 percent open . 
bonds were flat across the curve , and dealers said a thanksgiving Day holiday in the U.S. on Thursday had not helped counter the local market &apos;s limbo . 
there had been slight two-way interest in the bonds but no significant flows at all . 
&quot; The market doesn &apos;t deserve a comment today , and that &apos;s about all I can say for it , &quot; one dealer said . 
he said the market would be watching for the possible formation of a coalition government next week but added &quot; don &apos;t pin your hopes on it &quot; . 
new Zealand &apos;s main political parties are currently negotiating over the shape of the country &apos;s next government after an inconclusive general election in October . 
&quot; They said a few weeks ago the last week in November was going to be critical . 
well this is the last week , and there has been nothing happened . 
&quot; We &apos;re as a market no closer to guessing who it &apos;s going to be or what the policies are going to be , &quot; the dealer said .
