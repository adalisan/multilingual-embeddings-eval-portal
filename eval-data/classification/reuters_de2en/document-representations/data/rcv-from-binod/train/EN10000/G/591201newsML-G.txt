the global fight against malaria could have a new weapon with the discovery of an internal transport network within the host that might be used to starve or poison the parasite , researchers said on Thursday . 
there is no vaccine against malaria , a parasitic ailment that affects more than 200 million people worldwide and kills about two million each year , including one million children . 
absent a vaccine , scientists focused on combating the disease with drugs . 
this new research opens a different avenue for attacking it from within , according to Kasturi Haldar of Stanford University , an author of research published in the latest edition of the journal Science . 
the malaria parasite sets up shop in the red blood cells , where it is protected from attack by the body &apos;s immune system and some drugs . 
but the red blood cells do not provide enough food to nourish the parasite , so it must get food through a network of tubes that it constructs within the red blood cell . 
&quot; What we &apos;ve found is another target , a network that allows nutrients to be transported from outside the ( red blood ) cell , across the cell into the ( malaria ) parasite and we &apos;ve found a way of breaking the pathway and starving the parasite , &quot; Haldar said in a telephone interview . 
the network could also be used to channel poison into the parasite to kill it or make it ineffective , she said . 
scientists have believed for several years that such a transport network existed , and this latest research confirmed that . 
Haldar &apos;s team has used the strategy of cutting the network on a rodent strain of malaria , which is similar but not identical to the human strain . 
research is being done on laboratory rats , with the next step -- studies on primates -- at least a year away , Haldar said . 
she said that it would likely be &quot; a couple of years &quot; before scientists know whether they can safely try the strategy on humans . 
these kinds of treatment strategies have taken on increased importance as attempts to find a malaria vaccine have stalled . 
one promising experimental vaccine aimed at the deadliest form of the disease , plasmodium flaciparum malaria , was tried on seven human volunteers , according to research published in January in the New England Journal of Medicine . 
only one of the seven who were vaccinated got the disease , but researchers said more study was needed before the full potential of the vaccine was known .
