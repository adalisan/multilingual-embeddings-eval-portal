Ukraine is considering increasing the 1997 budget deficit level agreed with the International Monetary Fund , but economists said on Tuesday the move would not necessarily crush hopes for a big new loan . 
&quot; It might hurt talks with the IMF , but I am hopeful the mission will leave Kiev having agreed measures with Ukraine , &quot; Rafal Antszak , of the Harvard Institute for International Development , said . 
&quot; The IMF has not yet agreed to raise the deficit target . 
it could be a problem but the IMF might change its mind , &quot; said a Western economist who asked not to be named . 
they were responding to comments at the weekend by President Leonid Kuchma &apos;s aide on the economy , Valery Litvitski , who said the former Soviet republic might increase its 3.8 percent deficit by up to one percentage point . 
economists say 3.8 percent is the level agreed by the IMF , whose mission is in Kiev to review the next tranche of an $ 876 million stand-by loan and discuss a $ 2.5- $ 3.0 billion Extended Fund Facility due to replace the stand-by loan . 
an IMF official said on Saturday said he was hopeful Kiev would get the loan soon , and Litvitski said the two sides had &quot; understood each other very well &quot; on all issues at talks so far . 
the 3.8 percent figure approximated to three percent by Western standards , Central Bank Chief Viktor Yushchenko said . 
the Western economist said the IMF mission , which began work on Wednesday and is due to leave on November 12 , had not agreed to any deficit increase at the weekend . 
&quot; Current revenue levels don &apos;t cover expenditure and they are seriously looking at expenditure cuts . 
it &apos;s a fluid situation . 
the cabinet ministers are aware of the shortfall , &quot; he said . 
Litvitski said on Saturday that Ukraine would use methods like Treasury bill issues to avoid pushing up inflation . 
&quot; If it does not hurt economic reforms we will reserve the possibility of an insignificant increase -- no more than one percent -- in the budget deficit compared to the data agreed in our economic memoranda , &quot; he said . 
a big source of cash could be Eurobond issues , which Deputy Prime Minister in charge of the economy , Viktor Penzenyk , said last week could raise hundreds of millions of dollars in 1997 . 
finance Minister Valentyn Koronevsky has said the government would also issue four billion hyrvnias in Treasury bills , 3.3 billion of which would be to repay paper issued in 1996 . 
&quot; They are interested in containing inflation and they don &apos;t want to print more money , so they could sell more bonds or achieve more bilateral financing , &quot; the Western economist said . 
Kuchma and his government face a tough time balancing the demands of the IMF and keeping the population happy . 
millions of elderly people live on pensions as low as the equivalent of about $ 20 a month and the government owes 3.3 billion hyrvnias in wages and social payments . 
&quot; The problem is there is a difference in opinion about how to set the deficit . 
some want to reduce taxes and change the deficit , but you have to cut expenditures too , &quot; Antszak said . 
Kuchma has promised tax reform in 1997 to raise more cash from enterprises who are currently supposed to hand over about 95 percent of profits -- though few actually pay . 
but reducing admittedly crippling tax levels too much would lead to further imbalances in the budget , economists said . 
&quot; It all depends on how drastic the cuts are . 
you can &apos;t shift the shadow economy in a year ... though we could see an improvement by 1998 , &quot; Antszak said .
