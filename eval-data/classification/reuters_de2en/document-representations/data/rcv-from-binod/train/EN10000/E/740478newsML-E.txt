former Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) governor Bernie Fraser said on Friday there was always potential for conflicts of interest on the central bank board . 
asked to comment about potential conflict of interests for private sector members of the central bank board , Fraser told reporters : &quot; There &apos;s always potential for some conflict , that &apos;s true of any board , whether it &apos;s the Reserve Bank board or any other board , but there ways of dealing with those potential conflicts of interest . 
Fraser added that he believed potential conflicts were handled adequately during his seven year term as governor , which ended in September 1996 . 
the Reserve Bank of Australia took the rare step on Thursday of publicly responding to media reports of a potential conflict of interest in its board &apos;s decision to sell down two thirds of the nation &apos;s gold reserves . 
the decision was made by the RBA board , whose members included Hugh Morgan , managing director of miner WMC Ltd -- a company that has forward sold more than three million ounces of gold to hedge against a weak gold price .
