Pakistan &apos;s ousted prime minister Benazir Bhutto vowed on Wednesday to fight her dismissal and the dissolution of parliament by President Farooq Leghari in court . 
&quot; We expect the court to restore the ( National ) Assembly within a month , &quot; she told a packed news conference at her first public appearance since Leghari sacked her early on Tuesday . 
Leghari , saying corruption , nepotism and misrule had crippled Bhutto &apos;s government , dissolved the assembly and named an interim prime minister to supervise elections set for February . 
Bhutto described the president &apos;s charges as &quot; malicious , baseless and fabricated &quot; and called on him to resign if he wanted to prove he had not acted out of a &quot; lust for power &quot; . 
&quot; I will go to the court expecting justice , &quot; she said , noting that the Supreme Court had reinstated the government of her main political opponent Nawaz Sharif after it had been dismissed by then president Ghulam Ishaq Khan in 1993 . 
Bhutto said she did not know the whereabouts of her husband , former investment minister Asif Ali Zardari , who was detained on Tuesday , and accused Leghari of arranging his abduction . 
&quot; If by nine o &apos;clock tonight my lawyer has not been allowed to see my husband ... I &apos;m going to file an FIR ( first information report ) against Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari for the kidnapping of my husband , &quot; said Bhutto , 43-year-old mother of three . 
Pakistan &apos;s new caretaker government led by Meraj Khalid said it had lifted curbs on Bhutto &apos;s movements but Zardari was still in protective custody for reasons it did not fully explain . 
information Minister Irshad Haqqani told a news conference that Bhutto , who was confined by police to her official residence after being sacked on Tuesday , &quot; was free to carry out political activities and go wherever she likes &quot; . 
Haqqani said Bhutto could stay at the residence for 10 days , but not use it for party meetings or protests . 
Zardari is the focus of corruption allegations levelled against Bhutto &apos;s government . 
he has denied any wrongdoing . 
&quot; Asif Zardari is in protective custody . 
it means there is something against him , some inquiry may be on , or something else may be considered , &quot; Haqqani said . 
Zardari was detained by army officers in the Punjab provincial capital Lahore and later flown to Rawalpindi , near Islamabad . 
Bhutto , wearing a white headscarf and no make-up , launched a scathing attack on Leghari , saying he had no right to sack her . 
&quot; What he ( Leghari ) has done is against the vital interests of the unity , integrity and prosperity of Pakistan . 
he had no right to do this , &quot; a combative Bhutto declared . 
she said Leghari , a former party ally whom she had nominated for the presidency , had vowed not to sack any government . 
&quot; He was elected on a mandate that he would never dismiss a government . 
he has broken his solemn pledge . 
Bhutto said the murder of her brother Murtaza on September 20 was a pre-meditated conspiracy to destabilise democracy . 
&quot; The bullet that was meant to kill my brother physically was meant to destroy me politically . 
it was a conspiracy against the Bhutto family , &quot; she said . 
Bhutto , who clawed her way back to power in 1993 general elections after being sacked a first time in 1990 , denied her turbulent political career was over . 
&quot; Whenever I &apos;ve given a call , the people of Pakistan have never deserted me , &quot; she said . 
she said if the courts failed to reinstate her and if Leghari refused to step down , she would then decide whether to fight the promised February 3 election . 
Bhutto said the whole of Pakistan was mourning her dismissal , but there have been few signs of unrest , while supporters of opposition parties are jubilant . 
on the Karachi Stock Exchange share prices ended 5.25 percent higher on hopes of a serious anti-corruption drive under the new caretaker government , brokers said . 
in its biggest rise this year , the Karachi 100-share index jumped 78.63 points to end at 1,577.40 . 
in Islamabad , police detained about two dozen Bhutto followers who protested against her ouster , but otherwise there were no reports of popular agitation in her favour . 
the United States said on Tuesday Bhutto &apos;s sacking appeared to be constitutional , and it joined most other countries in expressing hopes for continued good relations with Pakistan . 
&quot; The dismissal of the government appears to be in accordance with the Pakistan constitution , &quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters in Washington .
