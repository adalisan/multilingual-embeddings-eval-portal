the Lebanese pound continued to strengthen slightly against the U.S. dollar in the week ended Friday in a quiet market despite the heated parliamentary debate on the 1997 state budget , dealers said . 
the Bank of Lebanon lowered its bid-offer intervention band to 1,544.5-1,554 pounds per dollar from 1,545-1,554.5 and the dollar continued to trade at the bottom of the band throughout the week , dealers said . 
&quot; The heated parliamentary debate did not leave any influence on the market as investors knew that this debate will not affect the budget figures , &quot; Talal Abou Zaki , manager of forex and money market for Bank of Beirut and the Arab Countries , told Reuters . 
after five days of heated debate , parliament approved on Monday a 6,433 billion pounds ( $ 4.15 billion ) state budget for 1997 with a 36 percent deficit of income against expenditure . 
Abou Zaki said investors are still interested in Lebanese pound-denominated treasury bills as their yields continued to fall . 
&quot; The trend is still the same , there is dollar offer and pound demand orders because investors see the trend of the Lebanese pound interest rates decreasing , &quot; he added . 
yields on Lebanese pound-denominated treasury bills continued to fall during the week . 
they now stand at 13.96 percent for three-month maturities , and 14.98 percent , 15.37 percent and 16.34 percent for six-month , one-year and two-year bills respectively . 
trade on the Beirut foreign exchange market was restricted to a very tight range of 10-20 piastres at the bid end of the central bank &apos;s intervention band , Abou Zaki said . 
all the offer of dollars was taken up by commercial banks , he added .
