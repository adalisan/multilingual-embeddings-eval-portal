a German parliamentary panel said on Tuesday the human rights situation in Turkey still gave cause for concern , with security forces torturing suspects and scores of people disappearing each year . 
a delegation from parliament &apos;s human rights subcommittee which recently visited Turkey said while Ankara had taken steps to investigate accusations of abuse by security forces , it was too early to judge if there was a genuine will to change . 
&quot; Lawyers , doctors and officials from human rights organisations described instances of torture in police custody , &quot; said Irmgard Schwaetzer , a member of the liberal Free Democrats who went on the fact-finding mission . 
Schwaetzer said it was still common for members of families believed to sympathise with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers &apos; Party ( PKK ) to simply &quot; disappear &quot; without trace . 
&quot; We received the impression that the security forces were systematically failed to be punished , &quot; Schwaetzer said . 
the subcommittee had documents showing 128 people had disappeared in 1995 alone , Schwaetzer said .
