a slow Australian share market slipped lower at the open on Tuesday with modest losses across the board as traders found little to excite in overseas market action . 
the All Ordinaries index shed 4.8 points to 2,441.6 . 
brokers said most losses were minor , reflecting a market that was lacking motivation as traders awaited the onslaught of first half profit results . 
&quot; It &apos;s off a little but nothing too dramatic , &quot; said a dealer at a Sydney-based brokerage , adding that apart from the banks , losses of several cents were widespread . 
&quot; The miners and the rest are generally a little lower except the banks which are a bit stronger . 
the banking sector was marginally firmer , with only Commonwealth Bank lower among the big four national outfits . 
brokers said the market appeared to have been expecting more substantial results . 
falls outnumbered rises by a ratio of about nine to five , while about 47 percent of stocks traded remained steady .
