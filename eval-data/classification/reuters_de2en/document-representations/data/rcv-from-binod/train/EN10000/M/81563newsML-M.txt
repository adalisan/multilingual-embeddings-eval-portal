Midwest flour mills will face more difficulty trying to source hard red winter wheat in coming weeks if U.S. farmers continue to hold off from selling their crop , grain industry sources said Friday . 
&quot; To say that mills are scurrying at the moment is certainly not right , but the lack of farmer selling has made it a tougher job for mills to do their purchasing , &quot; said one mill buyer in eastern Kansas who asked not to be named . 
analysts said they did not expect the pace of farmer sales to increase sharply any time soon . 
Tom Neher , a grain merchant for Benson-Quinn commodities in Kansas City , attributed the lack of farmer selling to three key factors : relatively low current prices ; farmers &apos; desire to defer income for tax purposes ; and more pressing farm tasks . 
&quot; They already sold some at harvest to cover costs ... and they &apos;re planning to hold on to the rest of it until they get a better price than what they have now , &quot; Neher said . 
&quot; The other thing is the tax part of it , wanting to defer income . 
producers have also been trying to harvest fall crops and plant next year &apos;s wheat crop . 
that means marketing grain has been a distant third priority , Neher said . 
there are few indications that wheat prices are ready to rally toward the highs seen earlier this year . 
Kansas City Board of Trade December wheat closed at $ 4.42-1 / 4 per bushel on Friday . 
that &apos;s a far cry from five months ago , when KCBT wheat set an all-time high of $ 7.44 per bushel . 
Gary Gilbert , assistant administrator of the Kansas Wheat Commission , explained that producers were simply acting according to what they thought was fair value for their crop . 
&quot; I think they &apos;re holding out not necessarily for higher prices but for harvest-time prices , &quot; Gilbert said . 
the lack of farmer selling has sparked an increase in the inverse between KCBT December and March futures contracts , and sources said the inverse would likely widen as mills sought to get coverage amid a backdrop of light farmer sales . 
on Monday , the KCBT December / March spread opened at an 8-1 / 2 cent per bushel inverse . 
by Friday , that inverse had widened to 13-1 / 4 cents . 
basis bids for hard red winter wheat at mill locations in eastern Kansas have also risen sharply in the last week , and merchandisers said this was natural as elevators tried to attract more wheat from the farm . 
but by the end of the week , the mill had raised its bid to 35 cents over December . 
similar scenarios were seen at mill locations around the Kansas City area .
