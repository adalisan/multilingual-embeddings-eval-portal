European bunker prices were steady on Wednesday but with sellers chasing buyers in the NWE region , dealers said . 
Rotterdam 380 CST was quoted at $ 90 / $ 92 , despite a late pick-up of barge prices to $ 90 / $ 91 . 
total Ara bunker demand was slight and competition for the limited business forced suppliers to offer low . 
&quot; We had to fight for scraps today , &quot; one supplier said . 
Hamburg prices dipped $ 1 a tonne to around $ 92 , although keen competition for larger enquiries made one major close a deal for some 2,500 tonnes at $ 90 , beating off Rotterdam rivals . 
Mediterranean prices were also broadly stable . 
only prices in the recently volatile French market rose , and there only by $ 1 a tonne . 
the rise came in reaction to Tuesday &apos;s sharp fall which encouraged greater demand . 
Egyptian fuel oil bunkers dipped by $ 3 . 
supplies in Alexandria were tight . 
port Said was expected to be dry for a week . 
Saudi Aramco cut Red Sea fuel oil by $ 4 to $ 98 and diesel by $ 5 to $ 188 , while , in the Gulf , it raised fuel oil by $ 3 to $ 105 and kept gas oil steady at $ 212 . 
the changes take effect from Thursday .
