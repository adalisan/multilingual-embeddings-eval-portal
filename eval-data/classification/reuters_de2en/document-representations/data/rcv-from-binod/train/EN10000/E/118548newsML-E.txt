an International Monetary Fund official on Tuesday pressed for the immediate passage of the Philippines tax reform bill , warning that inaction would result in a government budget deficit next year . 
IMF resident representative David Nellor , speaking to business executives on Tuesday , said &quot; timely action &quot; was imperative . 
&quot; Without revenues that would accrue from the comprehensive tax reform program ( CTRP ) , the public sector deficit would widen again in 1997 despite a continued buoyant economy , &quot; he said . 
the tax reform bill , which is now before the Senate , has been the subject of contentious debate for over a year . 
the bill aims to simplify the tax system and plug loopholes . 
it is now feared passage of the bill will be further delayed with last Thursday &apos;s change in Senate leadership . 
&quot; The strong political leadership that has delivered the dramatic economic gains in recent years becomes even more important in securing passage of economic policy in this new economic environment , &quot; Nellor said . 
&quot; inaction will be costly , &quot; he said , since the government had already largely exhausted its assets for privatisation . 
once the tax reform was in place , it would raise the public savings needed to develop infrastructure to sustain growth , he said . 
the Philippine government is aiming for a budget surplus of 14.7 billion pesos next year versus this year &apos;s goal of 17.5 billion pesos . 
Nellor estimated the Philippines would need to spend about $ 5.3 billion per year in the next 10 years for the country to catch up with Thailand &apos;s public capital stock . 
between 1991 and 1995 , public savings in the Philippines was about 3.0 percent of gross domestic product compared with 7.0 percent in Indonesia and 12 to 13 percent on average in Malaysia , Singapore and Thailand , according to Nellor . 
he added the prospect for the country in 1996 was GDP growth of 5.5 percent due to faster growth in manufacturing and services and the recovery of the agricultural sector . 
strong overseas remittances would spur GNP growth to about 7.0 percent this year , he said . 
inflation , which was at double-digit levels at the start of the year , is expected to be about 6.0 percent in December with improved agricultural supply , Nellor said .
