embattled President Ernesto Samper has drawn fresh fire for publicly suggesting that no Colombian is free of links to the drug trade . 
&quot; In Colombia there &apos;s not one Colombian who indirectly or directly hasn &apos;t been linked to drug trafficking , &quot; Samper during an interview with CNN last week in New York , where he addressed the United Nations General Assembly . 
&quot; That &apos;s why I represent Colombians so well , &quot; Samper added , in a back-handed reference to the scandal stemming from allegations that his 1994 election campaign was partly financed by Cali cartel drug lords . 
Samper , who was cleared by Congress in June of any political or criminal wrongdoing in connection with his campaign , has long argued that drug-related corruption has permeated all walks of life in Colombia . 
but his critics have jumped on his remarks to CNN as a public insult to his own countrymen , thousands of whom have died fighting the drug trade over the last decade . 
&quot; Out of the slightest amount of respect to the country , and to those people both known and anonymous who have died fighting the mafia &apos;s cartels , we should note that the president &apos;s statement is not only false but an outrage , &quot; Juan Carlos Botero wrote in an opinion column in Wednesday &apos;s editions of El Tiempo , Colombia &apos;s leading daily . 
Humberto de la Calle , who resigned as vice president last month citing the campaign drug scandal and what he described as rampant corruption in the government , was even more critical of Samper &apos;s remark to CNN . 
in an open letter to his successor Carlos Lemos Simmonds , who was sworn in to replace him Tuesday , De la Calle said Samper had not only insulted his country -- and given fresh ammunition to critics who brand it a &quot; narcodemocracy &quot; -- but committed an enormous tactical error just as he was trying to clean up his drug-tainted image in New York . 
in other developments , the U.S. embassy in Bogota confirmed that Cali cartel drug kingpin Helmer &quot; El Pacho &quot; Herrera had written a letter to U.S. 
Ambassador Myles Frechette apologising for his crimes . 
&quot; I ask you to transmit my message of pardon and regret to to the North American people and their authorities for all the harm that I caused through my drug trafficking activities , &quot; the letter said , according to a report in Bogota &apos;s El Espectador newspaper . 
Herrera , whose net worth was estimated in a recent report by the influential Semana news weekly at $ 11 billion , added in his missive that the American people could rest assured that &quot; I will never commit another crime . 
Herrera -- known as &quot; the man of a thousand faces &quot; because he was believed to use many disguises and the authorities had no real idea what he looked like -- surrendered to police on Sept . 1 after successfully eluding a nationwide manhunt for more than a year . 
he is considered the third top man in the Cali cartel &apos;s hierarchy and was the only one of its bosses still at large when he finally decided to give himself up . 
his surrender came two months after a U.S. request for his eventual extradition was denied by the government , which cited the constitutional ban that Colombia &apos;s Congress clamped on extradition in 1991 .
