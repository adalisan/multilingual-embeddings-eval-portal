following is the text of a report released by Britain &apos;s National Audit Office on assumptions for the 1997 budget projections . 
in a report issued today by the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Sir John Bourn , Head of the National Audit Office , reports on his audit of the changed key assumptions and conventions that underlie the public finances and the forthcoming Budget Statement to be delivered on 2 July . 
these were the assumptions adopted in preparing forecasts of the public finances for : economic growth ; unemployment and interest rates ; and the conventions used for projecting the proceeds from privatisation and from &quot; spend to save &quot; expenditure measures . 
Sir John &apos;s report concludes that : &quot; While the assumptions adopted by the Chancellor are not the only ones which could be reconciled with the evidence , in my opinion they have been arrived at systematically on the basis of the available data and by methods which interpret it in a reasonable way . 
Sir John commented that he welcomed the opportunity for the National Audit Office to provide an independent audit of Budget assumptions and conventions , and that he looked forward to having a continuing role in auditing the process of forecasting the prospects for public finances , as envisaged by the Chancellor . 
the National Audit Office have inspected relevant papers and interviewed officials in the Treasury , Inland Revenue , Customs and Excise , the Department of Social Security , the Department for Education and Employment and the Bank of England . 
the National Audit Office have also drawn on their own experience and current work in reviewing performance in the areas relating to the assumptions and conventions , and have also considered relevant evidence from non-government sources as necessary . 
their findings were as follows : privatisation proceeds In his report Sir John notes that the Government does not currently intend to make provision for privatisation proceeds for the years 1998-99 onwards and has made no announcements of any specific sales . 
he agrees that in these circumstances the decision not to anticipate any privatisation proceeds is reasonable . 
spend to Save The spend to save initiative announced in the 1996 Budget made provision for expenditure of 800 million stg to bring in some 6.7 billion stg . 
it has now been decided that , in estimating the savings , the convention should be that only the immediate cash gains brought about by the discovery of an error or fraud are included . 
this has the effect of reducing the savings to be scored to 4.9 billion stg . 
the report concludes that there are reasonable grounds for taking a cautious view of the balance of the original savings , which allow for future improvement in compliance once a fraud or error has been detected , and for wider deterrent effects . 
indeed a more restrictive view of some of the savings could have been supported . 
this is not because the original estimates were unfounded , but because they were subject to inevitable uncertainties . 
an assumption about the growth rate of the economy is needed to estimate future revenue yields . 
the Treasury do not forecast the course of the economic cycle beyond the short term and their medium term projections are based on an estimate of the underlying rate of growth that the economy could sustain with a stable rate of inflation . 
the Treasury propose to assume a growth rate of 2 per cent per year . 
the National Audit Office have examined a variety of relevant evidence . 
the trend growth over the last 40 years has been 2.3 per cent per year . 
the Treasury Panel of Independent forecasters average estimate of long term growth rates was 2.5 % . 
a National Audit Office survey of estimates of the underlying growth rate made by a selection of academics , banks , international organisations including OECD and IMF averaged 2.3 per cent , while the range of 23 outside forecasts for GDP growth suggested an average in the 2-2 1 / 2 per cent range . 
taking the evidence reviewed by the National Audit Office together the assumption of underlying growth in the economy of 2 1 / 4 per cent seems broadly consistent with past experience , with the range of published estimates and with assessment of the medium-term prospects for growth . 
an explicit assumption about the level of unemployment is needed in order to estimate cyclical social security expenditure on benefits claimed by the unemployed . 
for the November 1996 Budget , the Treasury made a forecast of unemployment . 
the Treasury now propose to revert to the use of a level planning assumption , set at 1.65 million UK claimants . 
the National Audit Office have examined available outside estimates of unemployment . 
the proposed planning assumption is at the higher end of the range of independent forecasts , while the average of independent forecasts remains below the planning assumption for the whole period to 2001 . 
the proposed planning assumption would seem consistent with the available evidence of unemployment prospects . 
interest Rates Prior to the announcement that the Bank of England would assume responsibility for setting interest rates , Treasury practice was to estimate a path for interest rates necessary to meet the Governments inflation target . 
the Treasury now propose to base their projections of interest rates on information from the financial futures market and from the yield curve for UK Government securities . 
this reflects a view that financial markets are efficient in valuing financial assets and that yields on long-term bonds reflect the short term interest rates that markets expect to prevail over the duration of the bond . 
the National Audit Office have reviewed the use of market information for projecting interest rates and concluded that while there are other methods , and there are a number of technical problems associated with the derivation of interest rates from financial information , the approach is a reasonable one for the purposes of fiscal projections . 
in a statement to the House of Commons on 20 May , the Chancellor asked the National Audit Office to report on some of the key assumptions and conventions that lie behind the forecasts of the public finances . 
the National Audit Office were invited : &quot; To assist the Government in preparing its forecast of the public finances , by reviewing the assumptions adopted for economic growth , unemployment and interest rates , and the conventions used for projecting proceeds from privatisation and from &apos; spend to save &apos; expenditure measures &quot; . 
the assumptions and conventions examined by the National Audit Office are that : 
- credit will only be taken for privatisation proceeds from sales that have already been announced ; 
- the estimate of savings generated by the spend to save programme announced in the November 1996 Budget will be limited to the direct effects of the measures , and will exclude indirect impacts such as the deterrent effect of the programme ; 
- the assumed underlying rate of growth of the economy will be 2 1 / 4 per cent per year ; 
- a flat planning assumption for unemployment will be used , rather than forecasts of actual unemployment ; 
- assumptions for the level of interest rates will be derived from expectations in financial markets . 
the audit undertaken by the National Audit Office does not relate to a set of financial statements prepared by reference to relevant accounting standards , nor can it appropriately be conducted by strict application of normal audit standards . 
the National Audit Office have instead reviewed the available evidence relevant to each of the above assumptions and conventions to reach an opinion on whether they were reasonable and could be adequately supported . 
the comptroller and Auditor General , Sir John Bourn , is the head of the National Audit Office employing some 750 staff . 
he certifies the accounts of all government departments and a wide range of other public sector bodies ; and he has statutory authority to report to Parliament on the economy , efficiency and effectiveness with which departments and other bodies have used their resources .
