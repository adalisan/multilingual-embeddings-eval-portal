driving rain and howling wind have greeted the world &apos;s Olympic chiefs in this usually sweltering resort on Mexico &apos;s Caribbean coast , prompting apologies from Mexican officials and even a request for legislation to fix the weather . 
after two days of downpour , Mario Villanueva Madrid , governor of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo where Cancun is located , said Thursday that Association of National Olympic Committees ( ANOC ) chief Mario Vasquez Rana had asked him to issue a decree banning rain . 
&quot; The burning sun that characterises Cancun and which had made itself scarce for us will doubtless be made up for by the hospitality with which we receive you , &quot; Education Minister Miguel Limon Rojas told ANOC and International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) members , by way of hopeful apology . 
IOC director general Francois Carrard , referring to a brief break in the deluge , said he was glad he did not have to use a gondola to cross Cancun &apos;s flooded main drag on his way to brief reporters . 
the slate-grey heavens then opened again . 
&quot; The weather report is such that by Sunday late afternoon ( the last day of the meetings ) we may regard a majestic , colourful sunset over Mexico , &quot; Carrard said , &quot; ... As we are flying home .
