Attorney General Janet Reno , whose future in President Bill Clinton &apos;s Cabinet is uncertain , tried on Wednesday to convince a sceptical Supreme Court to give police more power in traffic-stop cases . 
making her debut in arguing a case before the high court after nearly four years in office , Reno ran into a barrage of questions on whether police should be allowed to order all passengers out of cars in routine traffic stops . 
justice Antonin Scalia asked , for example , whether a police officer could stop a bus driver for a traffic violation and require that everyone get out . 
Reno said &quot; that might be a more difficult question &quot; but the officer would still be facing potential dangers and should have authority to keep passengers in or out of the bus . 
her 10-minute appearance continued a tradition followed by many , but not all , attorneys general of arguing at least one case in person before the Supreme Court during their tenure . 
government presentations are normally made by the U.S. solicitor general , a Reno deputy , or one of his assistants . 
Reno has made clear she wants to remain in office as Clinton begins his second four-year term in January , and says no one at the White House had ever directly criticised her . 
but the White House has remained silent on her future , saying only that Clinton expects to meet with her soon as he makes decisons regarding the shape of his second-term Cabinet . 
that has inevitably spawned talk Reno may have fallen out of favour because she has appointed special prosecutors to investigate ethics questions involving Clinton , first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and high administration officials . 
the Justice Department was not even a party to the case Reno picked for her widely watched court debut . 
it pitted the state of Maryland against a passenger who was ordered out a car during a routine police stop and was arrested when some crack cocaine fell to the ground . 
the man argues that constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures prohibit police from ordering passengers out of cars during routine checks without grounds to suspect a crime has been committed . 
Reno argued in support of the state , saying traffic stops present a &quot; special danger for police officers who are vulnerable to attack . 
justice John Paul Stevens asked if the officer might not be in greater danger of a confrontation by ordering passengers out of the car . 
but Scalia later asked if states that require reasonable suspicion of a crime might have even more problems . 
Reno was unable to answer the questions . 
she said it was &quot; reasonable &quot; for a passenger to be told to get out of a car and wait while the officer checks the driver &apos;s license and writes up the ticket , even if it lasts 20 minutes . 
&quot; That is a limited duration , &quot; she said . 
she described it as a minimal intrusion on passengers and emphasised police officer safety over the Constitution &apos;s Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches . 
justice Anthony Kennedy expressed concern the police as routine practice would make large families wait outside the car while lecturing the driver on a traffic violation . 
justice Sandra Day O &apos;Connor posed the situation of a mother with a young baby forced out of the car in a driving snowstorm or a hard rain and made to put up her hands . 
&quot; This can be carried to extremes , &quot; she said . 
Scalia agreed , saying : &quot; They will make everybody get out . 
that will be an invariable rule . 
Byron Warnken , arguing for the passenger who sought to suppress the drug evidence , said , &quot; Officer safety is an issue , but it cannot take all Fourth Amendment rights away . 
a ruling is due by the end of the court &apos;s term in June .
