signalman Bob Payne was on leave in west London 40 years ago when a telegram summoned him urgently back to barracks . 
the crisis following Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser &apos;s nationalisation of the Suez canal in July 1956 was hotting up and Britain was preparing for a disastrous war that would ultimately seal its fate as an imperial power . 
Payne , now a 62-year-old semi-retired garage proprietor , was a conscript in the Royal Signals who had made a bit of a name for himself as a footballer and was popular with the army as a result . 
when orders came through that his unit was to be ready to move out &quot; to the Middle East somewhere &quot; , he heard that he might be able to avoid being sent overseas as he was nearing the end of his period of National Service . 
his interview with the colonel was not a success . 
&quot; He told me : &quot; you &apos;re in the bloody army now and we can do what we bloody well like with you . 
now get out &apos; , &quot; Payne recalled . 
even before it became known that Britain and France had hatched a secret plot with Israel to retake the canal from Nasser , the Suez crisis was dividing Britain bitterly . 
an opinion poll showed that 37 percent of Britons thought Prime Minister Anthony Eden was right to take military action against Egypt while 44 percent said he was wrong . 
with the Suez canal carrying two thirds of Europe &apos;s oil , Eden maintained that Nasser had &quot; a thumb on our windpipe &quot; and the troops must go in , despite the determined opposition of the United States and its Secretary of State , John Foster Dulles . 
at home , there were scenes of uproar in the House of Commons , while in a broadcast heard by the troops as they readied for action in the Mediterranean , Labour Party leader Hugh Gaitskell called them &quot; aggressors &quot; . 
as a demonstration by 30,000 anti-Suez protesters calling for &quot; Law , not War &quot; in central London &apos;s Trafalgar Square turned violent , The Observer newspaper said : &quot; We had not realised that our government was capable of such folly and such crookedness ... 
in our view there is one essential : Anthony Eden must go . 
Payne meanwhile was at sea on the cruise liner Asturias , converted to carry 2,000 troops . 
they had a miserable passage through the stormy Bay of Biscay . 
most were horribly seasick and had little idea of what war was like . 
&quot; They thought it would be like in the pictures , &quot; Payne said . 
&quot; You get shot and then you get up and walk away . 
they went ashore at Port Said , using nets to climb down the side of the Asturias into landing craft . 
&quot; I remember thinking when we were going down that I &apos;m going to get to the back of the landing craft , &quot; Payne said . 
&quot; It &apos;s always the poor beggars at the front who get the packet . 
but in the event they met no hostile fire . 
Nasser &apos;s airforce had been neutralised by air strikes and the first wave of British and French paratroopers encountered little resistance . 
Britain &apos;s first helicopter-borne assault , which followed , was also considered a military success , with whirlwinds and Sycamores landing 425 men and their equipment . 
wireless operator Payne found his signal unit headquartered in an abandoned girls &apos; school , where the biggest treat was an occasional ration of fresh bread . 
British troops remained in Egypt for several weeks after a November 6 ceasefire , brought about by intense United States pressure , which came into force before they had taken the whole of the canal . 
for many of the British soldiers it was their first trip abroad , and even after the privations of postwar Britain , life in Egypt came as a shock . 
&quot; The biggest thing was the poverty and the flies . 
market stalls were black with flies and they didn &apos;t take any notice . 
that was the biggest cultural shock , &quot; Payne said . 
when British troops sailed out of Egypt , they left behind them a statue of the Suez canal &apos;s builder , Ferdinand de Lesseps , wearing a green commando beret which the Royal marines had placed there . 
historian Robin Neillands noted : &quot; So the Suez affair ended , with a small defiant gesture to cover a major political defeat . 
Eden &apos;s decision to act with France and Israel was an attempt to show that Britain could act on the world stage without the endorsement of the United States . 
that attempt failed in the face of intense U.S. opposition to the Suez adventure , and as a price of restoring the transatlantic alliance , London was forced to accept that it was now subservient to Washington . 
Eden , who had been ill , left Britain on November 23 for Jamaica , where he recuperated at &quot; Golden Eye &quot; , the house of James Bond author Ian Fleming . 
in January 1957 he resigned . 
historians believe that if the Suez canal had been swiftly and decisively seized , Britain might have got away with it . 
British World War Two leader Winston Churchill was once asked what he would have done .
