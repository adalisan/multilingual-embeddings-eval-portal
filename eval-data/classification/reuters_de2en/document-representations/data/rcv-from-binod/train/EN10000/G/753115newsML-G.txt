the United States , concerned that Angola is unravelling like other parts of Africa , is considering ways to keep the hard-won peace there from collapsing , officials said on Thursday . 
asked if the peace process agreed in 1994 was dead , one official replied : &quot; Not yet but close . 
the situation is &quot; very worrisome to us and has been so for one and a half months ... 
if I were ( Angola President Jose Eduardo ) Dos Santos , I &apos;d say that ( Jonas ) Savimbi has dropped out of the ( peace ) process , &quot; the official added , referring to the leader of UNITA , the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola . 
an official said former UNITA rebels had captured two towns this week and there were increasing incidents between these forces and government troops . 
a delegation from the Angolan government is due to be in Washington for consultations the first week in August , U.S. officials said . 
another official Angolan delegation visited the U.S. capital three weeks ago . 
the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday also sounded an alarm , asserting UNITA was trying to restore its military capabilities and warning of possible sanctions . 
a security council statement said increasing tension in the northern part of the country was spreading rapidly to the central and southern provinces , &quot; with very dangerous implications for the implementation of the remaining tasks of the peace process . 
&quot; The council calls upon both parties to refrain from any use of force , &quot; it added . 
it affirmed its readiness to &quot; consider the imposition of measures , &quot; including trade and travel curbs first threatened in 1993 , &quot; unless UNITA takes irreversible and concrete steps immediately to fulfil its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol , &quot; the 1994 agreement on which the peace process is based . 
the council demanded that UNITA demilitarize all its forces , transform its radio station into a non-partisan broadcasting facility and cooperate fully in normalising state administration throughout the country . 
after two decades of civil war , UNITA entered into a unity government in April with the ruling MPLA ( Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola ) but still controls large areas of the country . 
UNITA fighters should have been demobilized or incorporated into a new national army . 
just last month , Savimbi and Dos Santos accepted U.N. proposals for defusing tensions between them . 
but U.S. officials said there have been &quot; increased desertions &quot; from the new national army of UNITA troops . 
one official said it appears that UNITA has fractured with some members helping to implement the Lusaka accords and others undermining them . 
as result of the fighting in Zaire , which toppled long-time dictator Mobuto Sese Seko , UNITA has lost a major source of support and found it more difficult to ply its diamond trade because supply routes are cut off , officials said . 
the United States , which supported and helped arm UNITA during the civil war in the Cold War era , was a major backer of the Lusaka peace accords . 
officials said that because of this history , Washington still believes it has a moral as well as practical reasons for remaining involved in Angola .
