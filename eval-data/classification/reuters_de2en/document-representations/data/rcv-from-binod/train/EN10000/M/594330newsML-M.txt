South African shares ended Monday firmly down with the golds board falling sharply as the ailing bullion price suffered a renewed bout of weakness , dealers said . 
the price of the yellow metal came under heavy selling pressure as it pushed quickly through the technical support level of $ 343 and last fixed in London at $ 340.70 . 
the dropping gold price also pulled sliver lower . 
dealers said the whole sector was too jittery for any form of solid investment strategy . 
&quot; You have to be crazy to buy into this market . 
it is far too volatile , &quot; said one dealer . 
the golds index lost 2.89 percent , or 35.5 points , to 1,192.8 . 
amongst individual firms Vaal reefs dropped 600 cents to 260.00 rand and Kloof shed 140 cents to 29.50 rand . 
the wider market also suffered a weak day as the hangover from Friday &apos;s sharp fall on Wall Street made it itself felt in most of the main industrial stocks . 
a mixed opening in United States shares scotched any chance of a late rally to cheer local dealers as New York players are staying out of the market until after a Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday where some analysts are predicting a U.S. interest rate rise . 
the all-share index dropped 26.2 points to 7,116.6 as the industrials index fell 22.7 points to 8,398.5 . 
volumes were modestly healthy after being boosted by asset swaps and 677 million rands worth of shares changed hands . 
dealers said there was money waiting to invest into South African shares , but that the market needed to get a firm direction before it would start to flow in . 
&quot; We need to get the ( Federal Reserve ) meeting out of the way . 
there is a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines of our market , but we need to get some direction first , &quot; one dealer said . 
several individual shares stood out on the day with industrial holding firm Barlow Ltd ending at 48.85 rand , down 55 cents , after it posted poor half year results . 
the group saw an earnings per share figure of 145.4 cents , below the bottom end of analysts &apos; expectations . 
shares in industry firm Chariot Holdings Ltd had a roller-coaster day as they rode a rumour mill over a possible U.S.-related buy , dealers said . 
the firm is thmught to be at the head of a race to strike a deal with Federal-Mogul SA , the South African unit of U.S. vehicle spares firm Federal-Mogul Corp. 
chariot shares hit a new year high of 122 cents in morning trade before falling back to 117 cents , a gain of four cents in heavy trade . 
news that Lonrho plc and JCI Ltd are in merger talks caused a stir in the market as Lonrho ended up 32 cents to 10.30 rand and JCI jumped 60 cents to 43.40 rand . 
also in the mining sector , shares in Lebowa platinum Mines Ltd ( Leplat ) , which is to merge with fellow mining firms in the Anglo American platinum Corp Ltd ( Amplats ) stable , dipped in heavy trade . 
dealers said that most of the more than three million shares that changed hands did so in a single bookover deal , where a broker acts as both a buyer and seller of shares . 
Lebowa ended down 10 cents to 280 cents . 
Hn the futures market contracts also had a weak day ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting . 
the all-share June contract was at 6,530 / 40 from 6,593 as the industrials contract came off to 8,177 / 82 from 8,240 .
