Folgers Coffee Co . , a unit of Procter and Gamble Co . , said Tuesday it will cut the list price of its standard 13-ounce can of ground regular and ground decaffeinated coffees by 30 cents due to the decline in prices on the world &apos;s futures markets . 
the decrease , which will take effect Sept . 8 , brings the price for a standard 13 ounce can of regular ground to $ 3.06 , and decaffeinated ground Folgers to $ 3.76 , the company said . 
&quot; The list price of Folgers coffee generally reflects the price of green coffee sold on the commodity market , &quot; the company said in a statement . 
&quot; While supply of high quality arabica coffee remains tight and the market volatile , green coffee prices began declining with added supply from the Brazilian crop now being harvested . 
industry sources said rumours had recently been swirling around the coffee market that Folgers would cut retail prices after the price of green coffee on New York &apos;s Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange slipped some 40 percent from 20-year highs in late May . 
Folgers and other major roasters were forced to raise the retail price of a 13 ounce can of ground coffee four times since the beginning of the year from $ 2.41 to $ 3.36 to reflect the soaring cost of green coffee on the world &apos;s futures markets . 
tight supplies of arabica beans , with inventories worldwide hovering near 20-year lows , combined reduced 1997-98 crop estimates from Brazil and the prospect of reduced availability of coffee from Central America and Colombia in the 1997 / 98 season were some of the factors behind the sustained futures rally . 
the company said the list price of Folgers instant Coffee will remain unchanged at $ 3.96 for the 8-ounce size , and Folgers singles will also remain unchanged .
