Switzerland gave Poland on Friday a detailed list of 53 Poles , including several holocaust victims , whose Swiss bank accounts were declared ownerless after World War Two and handed over to Warsaw , the foreign ministry in Berne said . 
( corrects to make clear that not all on list were necessarily Holocaust victims ) . 
Federal Archives officials had compiled the once-secret list of names and account details from records kept during a 1960s sweep of banks for lost Holocaust assets . 
&quot; The Polish authorities have committed themselves to make the list public as soon as possible in order to locate those entitled to restitution , &quot; a foreign ministry statement said . 
the move followed an official Swiss report last month that showed Switzerland paid Poland 464,000 Swiss francs in 1975 under a pact that also settled Swiss claims for property seized by communist Poland after the war . 
Switzerland did not supply the owners &apos; names under a Cold War policy of hiding the identities of account holders from communist regimes for fear they could be in danger . 
Poland put the money into its budget and did not try to find the heirs . 
the Polish government pledged last week to seek the rightful owners of the money . 
officials have said Switzerland would also contact Hungary , the other eastern Europe state with which it had a similar deal , to talk about providing a list of original account holders . 
Berne paid Hungary 325,000 francs in 1975 under the accord . 
Berne started reviewing the pacts with Poland and Hungary last year after U.S. 
Senator Alfonse D &apos;Amato , head of the Senate Banking Committee , accused it of using unclaimed Jewish accounts to pay off Swiss nationals for assets seized by communists . 
two independent Swiss historians charged by Berne with investing the pacts concluded they were not tantamount to paying off Swiss and followed international private law by returning unclaimed accounts to the owners &apos; home countries . 
but they criticised Berne &apos;s decision not to provide the names , which made it impossible to find the original owners . 
the Polish and Hungarian payments came from a pool of about 10 million Swiss francs found in the bank search for accounts left ownerless by Jews and other victims of Nazi persecution .
