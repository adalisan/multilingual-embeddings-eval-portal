Burma &apos;s National League for Democracy ( NLD ) said on Thursday it would hold a congress September 27-29 to celebrate the eighth anniversary of the party &apos;s founding . 
a party official told Reuters about 200 people had been invited to attend the congress . 
a plan to hold a similar gathering in May spurred widespread arrests of democracy activists by the military government . 
&quot; We have sent out about 200 invitations to elected representatives from all over the country . 
but we don &apos;t know how many will be able to attend , &quot; the NLD official said . 
the meeting will be at held the house of party leader and co-founder Aung San Suu Kyi . 
the NLD , which won a landslide victory in a 1990 general election that was never recognised by the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) , tried to hold its first-ever gathering of elected representatives in late May . 
it would have been the first time Nobel laureate Suu Kyi met the elected representatives as a group . 
she was under house arrest during the 1990 election . 
but days before the meeting was to be held , the SLORC launched a sweeping crackdown on NLD members , arresting more than 260 politicians in a couple of days . 
the SLORC released most of the activists after about 10 days , saying it had only detained them in an effort to avoid anarchy or unrest that could result from the party meeting . 
Suu Kyi and the members of the executive council were spared arrest , but they held a meeting with about 300 party members instead of the original gathering of elected representatives . 
after the meeting , Suu Kyi said the NLD vowed to increase the momentum of its efforts to restore democracy to Burma . 
she said the NLD , which pulled out of government-sponsored constitutional talks last November , had decided to draft its own version of the constitution . 
shortly afterward , the SLORC passed a sweeping law , seen as an effort to muzzle Suu Kyi and the NLD , calling for long prison terms for any person or organisation seen disrupting the government &apos;s constitution-writing efforts or viewed as trying to disrupt peace and stability of the country . 
about 70 NLD members and supporters have been arrested or charged and given long prison terms since May . 
one diplomat said the upcoming party meeting would be a test of how serious the SLORC was in its desire to muzzle Suu Kyi . 
&quot; Although this size gathering will clearly be seen as a challenge to the SLORC ... so far government reaction has been low key , &quot; the diplomat said . 
&quot; NLD attendees have started to arrive in town , but no arrests or detentions that we &apos;ve heard of so far .
