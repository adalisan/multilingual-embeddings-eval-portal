the Bulgarian Lev rose further to 1,595-1,600 per dollar around 1030 local time ( 0730 GMT ) from the opening &apos;s 1,605-1,610 , as investors &apos; interest in local debt paper began to re-emerge , dealers said . 
the Lev closed at about 1,605-1,625 on Tuesday . 
&quot; The market is dollar-bearish . 
banks and clients are offering light ( foreign currency ) volumes to boost Lev liquidity for pending payments and treasury paper investments , &quot; a commercial bank dealer said . 
interest in government securities was seen re-emerging along with expectations of relative Lev stability and a further rise in yields on discount T-bills sold daily by the Finance ministry . 
the average yields to maturity on one- and four-week discount T-bills sold on Tuesday rose to 0.46 and 3.77 percent , respectively , from 0.41 and 3.71 percent at Monday &apos;s auctions . 
&quot; yields are rising but they are still below last week &apos;s levels . 
if they do not rise further this week , the central bank might cut its main interest rate and this would lower yields on floating interest T-bills , &quot; another dealer said . 
yields to maturity on one- and four-week discount T-bills sold last week stood between 0.58-0.82 percent and 3.84-4.68 percent respectively , central bank figures showed . 
interest on floating interest T-bills is pegged to the central bank main interest rate , now set at 4.29 percent monthly , and falls with each cut in the main rate . 
the Bulgarian National Bank sets its main interest rate weekly , adjusting it to the weighted average effective monthly yield of the one- and four-week discount T-bills .
