Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said he sees no short cut to normal relations with arch-foe India . 
but a government statement on Tuesday also quoted him as saying in a speech to the National Defence College in Islamabad there was no reason why outstanding issues between the two neighbours could not be &quot; addressed and meaningfull resolved &quot; . 
&quot; We nurture no illusions and have no unrealistic expectations , &quot; Sharif said while referring to a recent resumption of peace talks between the two sides after a three-year hiatus . 
&quot; We fully realise that there is no short cut to the process of normalisation of relations with India , &quot; he said . 
&quot; An integrated structured approach has to be pursued for cooperative and good neighbourly relations , &quot; he was quoted as saying . 
but Sharif said Pakistan was seriously concerned about India &apos;s nuclear and ballistic missile programme and accused New Delhi of arrogance by rejecting Islamabad &apos;s calls for &quot; a zero missile regime &quot; in South Asia . 
&quot; India has consistently expanded its nuclear and ballistic missile programme while spurning all non-proliferation initiatives at the bilateral , regional and global levels . 
both India and Pakistan are threshold countries , believed capable of developing nuclear weapons quickly and have refused to sign the international Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty concluded last year . 
Sharif is due to meet the next Indian prime minister on the sidelines of a South Asian summit conference in the Maldives next month following talks in New Delhi between foreign ministry officials of the two countries on March 28-31 and between foreign ministers on April 9 . 
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from Britain in 1947 , two of them over the disputed Himalayan region of Jammu and Kashmir . 
Sharif said he wanted a peaceful settlement of the Kashmir dispute and praised Moslem militants fighting Indian rule over two thirds of the region for what he called &quot; a valiant struggle to achieve their right to self-determination &quot; . 
Islamabad , which controls the remaining third of the region , wants the predominantly Moslem Kashmiris to decide in a U.N.-mandated plebiscite whether to join Islamic Pakistan or Hindu-majority India . 
India regards the whole of Kashmir as its integral part , while some of the militant groups seek to reunite Kashmir as an independent state , an idea opposed by both India and Pakistan .
