West Indies captain Courtney Walsh paid tribute to fellow fast Bowler Curtly Ambrose after he lifted the tourists to a six-wicket win in the third test against Australia on Saturday . 
Ambrose risked aggravating a hamstring injury to silence his critics with an inspirational haul nine wickets in the match . 
his efforts , hampered further by cramps in his legs , helped West Indies wrap up a remarkable victory inside three days at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . 
&quot; He knew the importance of the match and he was going to be out there regardless of what happened . 
his country needed him , &quot; Walsh said of his regular new-ball partner after the big Antiguan took four for 17 in Australia &apos;s second innings . 
he led from the front and took a lot of pressure off the other bowlers . 
the victory cut Australia &apos;s lead to 2-1 in the five-test series . 
after routing Australia for 122 in their second innings on Saturday , West Indies reached their victory target of 87 just before the scheduled close of play for the loss of four wickets . 
Ambrose , whose lacklustre performances in the first two tests yielded just three wickets at a dismal average of 93 , finished with outstanding match figures of nine for 72 . 
number three batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul calmed his side &apos;s nerves with a composed 40 to steer West Indies within sight of victory at the end of an eventful day during which 15 wickets fell . 
after heavy defeats in the first two tests , West Indies must win in Adelaide and Perth to regain the Frank Worrell trophy . 
&quot; Our backs were up against us and it was a very important match for us . 
it has put us back in the right direction and our confidence is now coming back , &quot; Walsh said . 
despite the victory , West Indies will remain concerned about the poor form of vice-captain and key batsman Brian Lara , who scored two in each innings . 
the temperamental left-hander has amassed a paltry seven runs in his last four test innings , falling victim to Australia fast Bowler Glenn McGrath on each occasion . 
West Indies , who resumed on 233 for nine on Saturday , scored 255 in their first innings after dismissing Australia for 219 . 
Australia captain Mark Taylor said his side still held the pyschological edge , adding that the uneven bounce in the pitch favoured the tourists &apos; pace attack . 
&quot; We are still leading 2-1 at this stage and I would have taken that position before the start of the series , &quot; he said .
