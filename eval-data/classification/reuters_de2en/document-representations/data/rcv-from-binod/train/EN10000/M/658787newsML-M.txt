world cocoa bean prices ended the week with another strong upward surge , pleasing speculators who had invested heavily in the chocolate-making commodity earlier in the week . 
once again predictions of disruptions to the world &apos;s weather patterns were the main reason behind the rise which has taken London cocoa July futures to their highest level for a year at 1,122 stg . 
late last week the price was languishing around 980 stg a tonne in a soggy looking market . 
the catalyst for this near 15 percent increase in prices was the U.S. National Oceanic and atmospheric Administration saying warm ocean temperatures off the western coast of South America had triggered an El Nino weather pattern in the Pacific . 
this could bring dry , damaging weather to key cocoa-growing areas such as Indonesia , it said . 
the havoc that this infrequently occurring phenomenon has traditionally played with world weather patterns caused other pundits to predict unusually dry weather could be expected in West Africa , another key cocoa producing area . 
despite scepticism on the part of some traders , one pointed out that statistics showed a high correlation between years when El Nino is around and years of cocoa deficits . 
the heavy volume of business that accompanied the upward surge in prices convinced some traders that a sustainable bull trend had developed . 
among other commodities soybeans futures on the Chicago Board of Trade soared the maximum daily limit of 30 cents a bushel to $ 8.72 as supply concerns worried traders . 
importers of U.S. soyabeans about low soyabean stocks following supply and demand forecasts from the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) on Thursday . 
it forecast end crop-year ( September / August ) stocks at 130 million bushels . 
&quot; 130 million is still an extremely tight situation and there &apos;s some question about how many beans are actually out there , &quot; said Jerry Gidel , Chicago based analyst with Dean Whitter . 
elsewhere , industrial metals gave a mixed performance with lurking worries about stock levels available to the market in the summer months underpinning copper prices . 
but aluminium again disappointed investors by being unable to sustain a recent rise above $ 1,600 despite a scenario of sharp falls in producer and market stocks this year . 
&quot; The fear in this market is that some producers may be considering restarting some of their potlines which were idled a few years ago when prices were very low , &apos; one analyst said .
