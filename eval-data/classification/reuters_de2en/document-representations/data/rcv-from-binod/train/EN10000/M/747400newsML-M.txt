the mark sank on its European cross rates on Tuesday as belief in a broad-based , timely start to European monetary union was reinforced by the French budget statement on Monday and Germany &apos;s effective endorsement of it . 
a fresh bout of mark selling was again concentrated against the dollar , which successfully cleared 1.80 marks , and sterling . 
but the move also filtered through to a weaker mark against European units like the French franc , lira and Swedish crown . 
the Swiss franc too was a major beneficiary of rekindled concerns about the stability of the single currency , reinforced by its traditional haven status and the Swiss economic recovery . 
&quot; France has effectively given up trying to get to 3.0 percent ( budget deficit / output ratio ) this year and Germany has effectively endorsed this , &quot; said Nick Parsons , foreign exchange strategist at Banque Paribas . 
&quot; The perception this creates and the comments we &apos;ve heard from the Bundesbank since can only encourage buying of Swiss francs , as well as the dollar and sterling . 
Bundesbank council members Hans-Juergen Krupp and and Ernst Welteke stressed late Monday that the Maastricht Treaty does not require a deficit / GDP ratio of exactly 3.0 PCT . 
their colleague Hans Juergen Koebnick endorsed that view today . 
Koebnick said he did not think the stability of the euro would be compromised if Germany and France had deficits in the region of 3.2-to-3.3 percent of GDP . 
the Bundesbank comments followed the announcement from French Finance Minister Dominque Strauss-Kahn on Monday of public deficit cuts worth about 0.4 percent of gross domestic product . 
the cuts are aimed at reducing a 1997 deficit estimated to be running at between 3.5 and 3.7 percent of GDP at present . 
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said he was convinced of Strauss-Kahn &apos;s commitment to meeting the deficit goals but declined to say whether the French measures Monday were enough . 
while there is some debate as to the degree of investor concern about a wide EMU or what exactly a &quot; soft &quot; euro would entail , traders said the uncertainty is a major factor . 
on one hand European inflation and budget deficits are falling , European bonds and equities are robust and the signs gradual economic recovery are evident in Germany . 
&quot; The problem is what sort of interest rate policy the European central bank will conduct for a wide EMU area , &quot; said a trader at a UK fund manager in London . 
&quot; It &apos;s relatively predictable for Germany France and Benelux , but when you include Italy and Spain the picture becomes muddier . 
the market assumption is that if France and Germany agree that overshooting deficit targets is now acceptable , then it will much more difficult to exclude the traditionally volatile Italian lira from the launch of the single currency . 
the argument is not all one way , however . 
some analysts believe a constitutionally independent European central bank will offset any fiscal laxity with a tight monetary policy , not least to establish its inflation-fighting credentials . 
there is also the fact that European countries starting EMU will have in excess of $ 200 billion of foreign exchange reserves to defend the new currency . 
this view is countered , however , by concerns the ECB will come under increasing political influence to keep interest rates low and the exchange rate soft while Europe restructures . 
the weak state of the European economy was highlighted today by the bigger-than-expected 1.6 percent drop in French industrial output in May . 
mark / Swiss was at 0.8201 / 02 versus 0.8215 / 18 . 
mark / Swedish crown fell to its lowest since last October and was last at 4.3160 / 90 compared with 4.3260 / 90 Monday .
