President Bill Clinton &apos;s peace envoy shuttled to Gaza to meet Yasser Arafat in a dogged bid to break an Israeli-PLO deadlock over a crucial troop withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron . 
as U.S.-Israeli-Palestinian discussions stretched into the pre-dawn hours in Gaza City on Monday , a senior Palestinian official voiced fresh optimism over the troubled peace process that envoy Dennis Ross had hoped his mission would revive . 
&quot; There has been progress in all directions , &quot; said Muhammad al-Nashashibi , finance minister in Arafat &apos;s cabinet . 
he told reporters that negotiators were working on a package deal , involving details of the long-delayed Hebron pullout as well as other issues . 
Nashashibi did not elaborate . 
Ross and Arafat were upbeat but cautious after four hours of talks on nailing down issues still delaying an elusive accord . 
&quot; We had very good discussions tonight , &quot; Ross said after meeting Arafat . 
&quot; This has been a good evening of work , but there is still work to be done . 
there are still issues to be overcome , and the process will continue . 
Arafat , who earlier cast doubts on Ross &apos;s objectivity , said he and the U.S. envoy had discussed &quot; how to push the peace process forward by all the means we have , and I thank him ( Ross ) for all his support . 
&quot; It was their second meeting in two days . 
Israel and the PLO accuse each other of foot-dragging in talks on the West Bank town , 80 percent of which was due to have been handed over to Arafat &apos;s Palestinian Authority months ago . 
the Hebron impasse has effectively blocked movement on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process as a whole . 
Palestinians were encouraged when Clinton last week criticised Israel &apos;s planned expansion of West Bank Jewish settlements , but U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher &apos;s subsequent comment that the onus was on Palestinians to make gestures on Hebron irked PLO leaders . 
&quot; Until now we cannot say we have reached agreement , &quot; Arafat said on Monday , but he called the talks &quot; positive and intensive &quot; , at one point referring familiarly to &quot; Dennis and I &quot; . 
the comradely tone stood in contrast with Arafat &apos;s remark on Friday that &quot; the most important thing is that Mr Ross has to be an accurate mediator , and not to be biased on the side of Israel . 
arriving late on Saturday , Ross went straight into meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem and with Arafat in self-ruled Gaza . 
Arafat &apos;s spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah has said Ross brought several ideas aimed at closing a deal on Hebron . 
&quot; The important thing that I am trying to do is to re-energise the peace process and then be in a position to go back in a couple of days to report back to the president , &quot; Ross told reporters on Sunday . 
Netanyahu wants a deal signed in 1995 changed to protect some 400 militant Jewish settlers in the heart of the town of 100,000 Arabs . 
Abu Rdainah said Ross &apos;s ideas focused on four main points : Israel &apos;s demand to be able to pursue suspects in Palestinian areas , reopening Martyrs Street in the heart of town that was closed to Palestinians , arming Palestinian police as provided in the original accord , and joint Israeli-PLO patrols . 
PLO security official Jibril Rajoub said of Israel &apos;s &quot; hot pursuit &quot; demand : &quot; We will never agree to this . 
the PLO wants assurances Netanyahu will carry out other deals signed by Israel &apos;s previous centre-left government once the deal on Hebron is carried out . 
Clinton last sent Ross after clashes in September in the West Bank and Gaza claimed the lives of 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis . 
he left after three weeks of mediation saying the sides had narrowed the gap but failed to reach a deal . 
Arafat said Ross would travel to Cairo later on Monday .
