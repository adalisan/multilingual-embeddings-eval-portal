South African health authorities said on Saturday a Johannesburg nurse had contracted the deadly Ebola virus , a tropical disease which killed nearly 250 people in nearby Zaire last year . 
the Gauteng Provincial Health Department said the nurse , who was not identified , was transferred to the intensive care unit of the Johannesburg Hospital and her family was put on 24 hour watch for symptoms of the disease . 
though South African hospitals have limited experience of treating the disease , the health department said the nurse was believed to be the first person to become infected with the Ebola virus inside the country . 
State radio said the woman , who is married with children , was an anaesthetic nurse in the city &apos;s upmarket Morningside clinic and could have contracted the disease from a patient . 
the department said the disease can be passed on only through direct contact with bodily fluids of a carrier and said there was no immediate risk to the city . 
the announcement followed an outbreak this month of Congo Fever , another highly infectious tropical disease , in Oudtshoorn . 
one worker at an ostrich abattoir died and 16 were taken to hospital in Cape Town , where three were still in a serious condition earlier this week . 
Congo Fever and the Ebola virus both cause internal organs to degenerate with massive bleeding , but Ebola , with an 80 percent fatality rate is more deadly than Congo Fever , which kills about 30 percent of its victims . 
the World Health Organisation said last month 14 people had died in a new Ebola outbreak in northern Gabon , where 21 people died in February . 
the virus killed 245 people in Kikwit , Zaire , in May last year in one of the worst outbreaks on record .
