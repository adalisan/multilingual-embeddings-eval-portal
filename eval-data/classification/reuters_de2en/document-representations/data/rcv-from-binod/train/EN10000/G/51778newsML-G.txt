Bolivian World Cup midfielder Erwin Sanchez will need knee surgery that is expected to sideline him for up to six months , his Portuguese club Boavista said on Friday . 
team doctor Rui Ramos said Sanchez , injured in Tuesday &apos;s UEFA Cup win over Odense of Denmark , would undergo surgery to his right knee at the beginning of next week . 
Sanchez started playing again at the start of the season after serving a four-month suspension for failing a dope test . 
his urine was found to contain more than the permitted amount of caffeine when he was tested after a match in January .
