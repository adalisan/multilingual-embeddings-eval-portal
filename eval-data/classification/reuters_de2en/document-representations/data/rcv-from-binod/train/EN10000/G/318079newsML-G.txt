five-times champion Surya Bonaly won a place in the French team at the European figure skating championships at the last minute on appeal , but a lowly sixth place in her qualifying group on Monday showed her comeback may have been premature . 
the champion from 1991 to 1995 fought hard against the federation decision to drop her from the team on the grounds that she had still not recovered from an Achilles tendon injury suffered last year . 
but her placing in the group , won by Elena Liashenko of Ukraine , was a disappointment for the 23-year-old . 
&quot; It was so-so . 
&quot; I was a bit scared and it was stupid to be scared for this because it was just a qualification . 
but it was difficult for me to be in good shape for this one . 
&quot; I have always been so confident but right now my confidence is only about 60 per cent , &quot; she added . 
she plans to work hard from now until the women &apos;s main event begins on Friday . 
&quot; Every day in practice has been better than the last , &quot; said Bonaly , who won her ninth French title in mid-December despite a display that did not inspire confidence and led to the federation &apos;s decision to drop her for the moment . 
it was almost there on Monday , until it vanished in a two- footed landing and she completed only three triples in her routine , two toe loops and a salchow . 
she made a mess of four other attempts . 
&quot; For me , qualification is a way to get fit again but it is difficult to perform your best programme , &quot; she said . 
&quot; It was difficult to give your best for nothing . 
Bonaly , a former gymnast , ruptured her right Achilles tendon doing acrobatics last May . 
Liashenko , bronze medallist two years ago , won the group despite marks as low as 4.5 out of the maximum of 6.0 . 
her best was 5.4 . 
German Eva-Maria Fitze , 14 , was a surprising second on her European debut with Yulia Vorobieva of Azerbaijan third . 
the three Russians , holder Irina Slutskaya , Maria Butyrskaya and Olga Markova , were all in the second group due to skate later on Monday .
