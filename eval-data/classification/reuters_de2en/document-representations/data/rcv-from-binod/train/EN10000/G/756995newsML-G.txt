the controversy stirred by race row politician Pauline Hanson has not deterred Hong Kong students from opting to study in Australia , a consulate official said on Friday . 
and while Hanson &apos;s extremist views on Asian immigrants have raised concerns in Hong Kong , most people were aware her beliefs were not widely shared , the consulate official said . 
between July 1996 and end June 1997 , the consulate issued 4,155 student visas in Hong Kong , up 11.5 percent year on year , said Roslyn Wells , public affairs manager at the consulate . 
&quot; We do not believe we have seen a direct effect from the so-called Pauline Hanson issue because most Hong Kong people know she doesn &apos;t speak for the Australian government . 
she is just one politician , &quot; Wells told Reuters . 
&quot; There &apos;s been enough reporting in Hong Kong to inform Hong Kong people of the reality of Australia being a multi-cultural society , and Pauline Hanson commands a very small amount of support in the Australian community , &quot; she said . 
but Wells conceded that Hanson &apos;s views , perceived as racist and anti-Asian in many parts of Asia , have raised concerns and anxiety in Hong Kong , a predominantly ethnic Chinese community . 
the consulate &apos;s education department has received calls from Hong Kong parents asking about how safe the country was if they were to send their children there to study , Wells said . 
student visas issued in May , however , dived 47 percent from the same month in 1996 , but Wells attributed that to more Hong Kong people opting to stay because of the historic return of the former British colony to Chinese rule at midnight June 30 . 
&quot; It was the handover in June here . 
they wanted to be here at that time . 
the South China Morning Post quoted an Australian education consultant as saying that the downturn in May was caused by anxieties over Hanson &apos;s extremist views .
