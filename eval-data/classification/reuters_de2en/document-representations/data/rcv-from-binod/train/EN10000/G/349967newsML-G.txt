when Majid graduated in Moscow as a turbines engineer , he never imagined that he would end up as a shoe salesman in Dubai . 
but wealthy Russian shoppers -- not logarithms -- paid for his Mercedes , the 28-year-old Syrian says . 
Majid is one of many Arabs in this bustling Gulf trade hub who has made a killing from Dubai &apos;s most acquisitive tourists -- visitors from the independent republics of the former Soviet Union . 
in recent years they have flocked to Dubai with bundles of dollar bills , swarmed through shops and bought luxury goods to sell on the streets of Moscow and other cities of the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) for huge profits . 
with Russian as a second language which he had acquired like many other Arabs who attended Soviet universities , Majid lives off arranging deals for Russians -- from buying container loads of women &apos;s tights to re-shipping Russian-made Lada cars to a thriving black market back home . 
but the days when Majid and his like used to arrange it all and bring home about $ 500 a day each in cuts and backhanders are nearing an end , as the need for bilingual haggling , the main tool of their trade , seems to be fading away . 
industry sources say the second half of 1996 saw a 70 percent drop in the number of Russian visitors to the fabulously wealthy oil state of the United Arab Emirates . 
Dubai , its commercial capital , is rapidly carving out a role as the Gulf &apos;s trade centre and hoping tourism will diversify its economy . 
Serji , a Lithuanian freight forwarder in the neighbouring emirate of Sharjah since 1994 , said his business was a roller-coaster last year , with a good first half and a dismal second half . 
this dropped to 170 when control systems were established by the Russian civil aviation organisation and International Air Transport Authority ( IATA ) , according to a study by Dubai-based Aviamost magazine . 
they attributed the drop to new customs duties on imports from the Gulf , a sharp increase in air fares and competition from other markets in the area -- Lebanon , Syria and Turkey . 
economics is not the only force behind the fall in the number of CIS visitors , however . 
tour operators and citizens in this conservative Islamic society have grown increasingly resentful of Russians . 
newspapers have reported police questioning of unaccompanied Russian women seen roaming the streets after midnight on suspicion of prostitution . 
they also said the women were not welcome to check in alone at some five-star hotels -- a policy enforced only recently . 
tourism industry sources said even those Russians engaging in legitimate business were changing their focus . 
&quot; They are no longer after four-wheel-drives , video recorders , and piles of furniture ... shopping has become very low on their lists of things to do , &quot; said a Sharjah tour operator . 
stacks of electronics waiting to be shipped to various destinations in the CIS are no longer a common sight outside hotels and on city curbs . 
many Russians seem to have discovered that being a middleman is more lucrative then buying and selling electronic goods . 
Russian-speaking Arabs are losing their turf to Russians who are learning the tricks of the trade and setting up shops to lure their compatriots . 
&quot; There is no longer any room for ( non-Russian ) foreigners in their business , &quot; said a Sharjah furniture showroom manager . 
&quot; Their requirements have become more complex , dealing with them ( the Russians ) takes more than the art of fixing a deal or exchanging dollars for dirhams , &quot; he added . 
&quot; Some of the money they bring in raises concern ... It is money that was hidden during the Soviet era brought here to be made legal , &quot; A Dubai-based travel agency manager involved with tours from the CIS said . 
he said Russians had approached many UAE nationals to use their bank accounts in return for a fee . 
&quot; Big sums were transferred to local joint accounts against generous fees , and some locals have reported being approached for the use of their bank accounts , &quot; he said . 
&quot; If they don &apos;t wash their money clean here , they will do it somewhere else , &quot; the manager added . 
he said UAE officials had approached him to find out whether the money was the proceeds of drugs or arms dealing . 
&quot; Concern heightened when one Russian bank applied for a licence to operate jointly with a local bank , &quot; he said . 
the local bank turned down the partnership offer .
