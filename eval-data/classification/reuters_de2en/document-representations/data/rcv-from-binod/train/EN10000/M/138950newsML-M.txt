Toronto stocks hit new highs for a third straight session on Tuesday , buoyed by stronger gold prices and the prospect of lower Canadian interest rates . 
the TSE composite 300 Index added 14.91 points to close at 5532.99 , beating Monday &apos;s record finish when the Canadian market broke through the key 5500-point barrier for the first time . 
&quot; If you look at the ( Canadian ) dollar and the domestic economy , the Bank of Canada still has room to lower interest rates , &quot; said Subodh Kumar , chief equities strategist at CIBC Wood Gundy . 
Canada &apos;s consumer price index ( CPI ) , minus food and energy prices , rose 1.2 percent in September , Statistics Canada said today . 
the weaker-than-expected data sparked a bond rally and expectations for a rate cut . 
the Canadian dollar weakened initially on the CPI , but rebounded to end firmer on the day . 
advancing stocks outnumbered declines 499 to 467 with 275 issues unchanged . 
trading was brisk with 105.2 million shares exchanging hands worth C $ 1.62 billion . 
* Barrick Gold Corp. led active gold stocks , rising 0.50 to 36.15 on 3.09 million shares . 
Barrick reported lower third quarter earnings due to an after-tax charge and higher costs . 
* Bre-X Minerals Ltd. did not join the move higher , falling 0.30 to 20.50 on 2.5 million shares . 
Teck Corp. , which closed up 1.25 at 28.25 , said earlier today it does not plan to bid for the junior gold miner .
