Finland &apos;s National Customs Board will start to publish preliminary foreign trade data seven weeks after the end of each month , NCB director Eero Kuisma said on Wednesday . 
the bank of Finland will start to release current account data on the same day as NCB publishes its preliminary trade balance figures , he told a seminar . 
figures for January 1997 will probably be released in the second week of March . 
NCB will publish detailed monthly foreign trade figures about 10 weeks after the end of each month , Kuisma said . 
the Bank of Finland will from the start of this year no longer conduct its monthly survey of exporters and importers to be able to publish its trade balance estimate . 
the central bank has published such estimates in 1995-1996 following Finnish membership of the European Union , which led to a delay in the publication of NCB &apos;s official foreign trade figures . 
Kuisma said NCB &apos;s full-year 1996 foreign trade data would be published in the first week of March . 
the exact date had not yet been decided .
