veteran Omar Camporese and Italian number one Renzo Furlan scored easy victories on Friday to give Italy a 2-0 lead over Mexico after the first day &apos;s singles matches in their Davis Cup first round tie . 
Camporese , 29 , returning to the Davis Cup after a four-year absence , posted a comfortable 2-6 6-0 6-4 7-5 win over Mexican number one Alajandro Hernandez on clay at the Foro Italico . 
the Italian scored 13 aces while Hernandez , a clay court specialist , had 16 double faults and several unforced errors . 
Furlan , ranked 51 in the world , then had equally few problems dismissing Luis Herrera 3-6 6-1 6-2 6-1 on a beautiful spring-like day in Rome . 
&quot; We have done the maximum but we have not won the match , &quot; Furlan warned afterwards . 
&quot; We must be very careful and we have to remember that against France last year we lost 3-2 after winningthe first two matches . 
Italy lost to France 3-2 in Nantes in the semifinals of the Davis Cup last year . 
Saturday &apos;s doubles match pits Diego Nargiso and Stefano Pescosolido against Mexico &apos;s Leonardo Lavalle and Oscar Ortiz .
