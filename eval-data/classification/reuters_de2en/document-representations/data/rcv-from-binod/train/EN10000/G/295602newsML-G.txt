the United States has accused Rwanda and Uganda of aggression against Zaire , which had repeatedly said the two neighbours were behind rebels who have seized a large tract of its eastern territory . 
&quot; We understand perfectly that Zaire has been attacked by Rwanda and Uganda . 
this poses problems both on the political and the humanitarian front , &quot; U.S. ambassador Daniel Simpson said in an interview broadcast on Zaire &apos;s state television on Thursday . 
Simpson met Zaire &apos;s ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko at his jungle palace of Gbadolite on the eve of Mobutu &apos;s return to France on Thursday for what aides said was further medical consultation following his cancer operation last August . 
&quot; I would like to underline that we support 100 percent the principle of the intangibility of Zairean frontiers , and we are totally against any secession or division of this country , &quot; the U.S. envoy added . 
Washington has until now made no public comment on Zaire &apos;s charges against Rwanda and Uganda or of alleged U.S. backing for the two countries . 
local newspapers in Zaire have said U.S. policy favours carving up Zaire &apos;s vast mineral-rich provinces into separate states . 
since fighting broke out last October , the Zairean army has been routed from the best part of the two Kivu provinces as well as a strategic town in Upper Zaire Province neighbouring Uganda . 
Zaire has consistently accused Rwanda , Burundi and Uganda of being behind the attack , saying Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila is a mere puppet in the hands of a coalition of ethnic Tutsi forces . 
Simpson said he would return to Washington this week and would discuss U.S. policy in Zaire with the newly appointed members of President Bill Clinton &apos;s adminstration . 
Mobuto &apos;s meeting with Simpson was followed by one with General fu Quanyou , chief of the general staff of the Chinese People &apos;s Liberation Army , who arrived in Zaire on Tuesday . 
State television reported that during meetings with the Zairean military high command as well as with Mobutu , the Chinese delegation agreed to relaunch military cooperation . 
in an earlier statement following talks with Zairean Foreign Minister Kamanda Wa Kamanda , Simpson stressed the importance Washington attached to elections in Zaire this year . 
legislative and presidential elections are to take place before July , but with president Mobutu &apos;s uncertain health , the war in the east , and the lack of voter registration , few observers believe the vote will go ahead as scheduled .
