all other major components increased , with the metals index leading the way , rising 1.1 percent . 
the agency &apos;s early estimate for the wood index showed a rise of 0.5 percent , and of 0.5 percent for the vegetable and animal products marker . 
the raw materials price index excluding mineral fuels is estimated to have increased 0.6 percent in February , the government agency said . 
the raw materials price index reflects the prices paid by manufacturers for key raw materials . 
unlike the industrial product price index , the raw materials price index includes goods that are not produced in Canada .
