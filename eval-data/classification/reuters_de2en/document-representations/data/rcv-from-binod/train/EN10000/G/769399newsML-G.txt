police made a daring raid on a New York apartment on Thursday , seizing several pipe bombs and arresting three &quot; Middle Eastern &quot; men suspected of making explosive devices , officials said . 
new York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the Joint Terrorism Task Force of local , state and federal agencies was investigating whether there was a possible plot to bomb New York subways or other targets . 
&quot; That &apos;s one of the things being looked at , &quot; Giuliani told WCBS Radio in an interview . 
&quot; The subways were closed down because the building is essentially right over a station . 
&quot; One of things being looked at it is , was there a plan to bomb various subway stations and if there was one , was it a realistic one , &quot; the mayor said . 
two of those arrested were shot by police officers who said they saw them lunge for one of the possible explosive devices as the early morning raid was in progress , officials said . 
the lives of the wounded men were not in danger and they were in custody in a hospital . 
four or five cylindrical pipe bombs were found in the ramshackle apartment in the Park Slope residential neighbourhood of Brooklyn , police sources said . 
city and federal officials declined to comment on the specific nature of the devices . 
&quot; We don &apos;t know exactly what this is at this point , but obviously the investigation is continuing , &quot; James Kallstrom , the head of New York &apos;s FBI office told a news conference at City Hall . 
&quot; There are a lot of leads , we &apos;re not going to talk about those . 
&quot; The individuals involved are Middle Eastern but we don &apos;t have definite confirmation of their nations of origin yet , &quot; the mayor told reporters . 
agents from the New York bomb squad , the FBI , Joint Terrorism Task Force and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms cordoned off a four-block wide area around the apartment , evacuated residents and diverted subway services . 
the raid created chaos for residents in the neighbourhood as police awoke them in the early hours . 
about 90 people were evacuated from their homes . 
&quot; I was sleeping and they were banging on the doors , &quot; said resident Evita Carabello , who lives in an apartment building near the one that was raided . 
&quot; They were yelling and yelling &apos; you have to leave , leave the house now because there &apos;s a bomb &apos; . 
four subway lines were diverted by the investigation , leaving hundreds of thousands of commuters seeking alternative transport .
