leading European share markets gradually slipped from record highs on Tuesday but remained strong even though their inspirational force , Wall Street , fell after a firm start . 
on the foreign exchange markets , the dollar held steady as Japanese officials managed to halt a slide they provoked last week , while sterling firmed on signs that British interest rates would rise . 
stock markets all hit their highs -- in London and Germany record highs -- in the morning as investors reacted to Monday &apos;s 1.72 percent surge on Wall Street . 
but the Europeans were often reluctant buyers as some analysts and traders said the markets were overbought and a correction was likely sooner or later . 
in London , the FTSE 100 climbed for the 11th consecutive session to an early intraday record of 4,720.3 points . 
this responded to Wall Street &apos;s surge overnight when investors gambled that the U.S. Federal Reserve would not put up interest rates when it holds a policy meeting on May 20 . 
but the London market turned after the Bank of England , newly empowered by the Labour government to decide interest rates , said that a further moderate tightening of British monetary policy would be needed . 
wall Street see-sawed after the opening following relatively weak April retail sales but after half an hour of trade the Dow Jones Industrial average was down 19.78 points at 7,272.97 . 
this dragged the FTSE down more than 20 points from the record high to 4,698.6 , still 29 points or 0.62 percent up on the day . 
faced with such a rapid rise in the past 10 days , traders believe the euphoria will not last . 
&quot; This market is overbought and needs to come down . 
all it will take is a big one-day drop on Wall Street to set things in motion , &quot; one trader said . 
but other traders said Wall Street still had some mileage in it after the retail sales figures , which showed a 0.3 percent drop as expected . 
&quot; The figures were smack in line and that &apos;s being viewed as a bullish sign , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; They would have had to have been pretty bad for the market to come off significantly . 
&quot; There is still a lot of money pouring into the U.S. market . 
people aren &apos;t expecting any aggressive Fed rate hikes so bond yields are dropping , &quot; another dealer said . 
but the market was still awaiting U.S. producer and consumer inflation data , due later this week , for a stronger indication of whether the Fed would move to tighten credit further on May 20 , dealers said . 
Paris was the strongest of the leading markets in percentage terms with the CAC 40 index of blue chips gaining about 1.4 percent in the morning . 
but it likewise fell from the highs and was up 29.36 points or 1.09 percent at 2,722.45 by mid afternoon . 
on the German markets the DAX index also climbed to an intraday record but it likewise slipped later . 
&quot; If there were major investor interest in the market the trading volumes would surely have to be higher than what we see right now , &quot; said one Frankfurt trader . 
&quot; We &apos;ve been at some lofty levels lately and it was time for some profit-taking . 
the DAX index closed up 19.78 points ( 0.55 percent ) at a record 3,595.15 before Wall Street opened . 
but in later post-bourse electronic dealings , the IBIS index was down 21.63 points at 3,571.51 . 
Deutsche Telekom fell 1.06 marks to 40.13 marks on profit taking after the company announced a group net profit of 1.8 billion marks ( $ 1.1 billion ) , a figure which analysts said was better than expected . 
the dollar was stable against the yen and mark , helped by calls from Japanese officials for calmer foreign exchange markets . 
it was at 119.12 yen after dipping to its lowest level in almost four months on Monday at 117.50 . 
&quot; This has been such a choppy , rumour-driven market in recent days that the market seems to have stalled itself until a more concrete fix on events feeds through , &quot; said Julian Jessop , international economist at Nikko Europe . 
Japanese ministry of finance officials precipitated the biggest one-week dollar / yen fall since 1989 last week by warning the markets about possible intervention to prevent further yen weakness . 
against the mark , the dollar was little changed from Monday just below the psychological 1.70 level at 1.6967 compared with 1.7035 late on Monday . 
sterling leapt over one pfennig after the Bank of England comments on monetary tightening in its quarterly inflation report . 
but later it retreated to 2.76 marks . 
the Paris CAC-40 index was up 29.36 points or 1.09 percent at 2,722.45 . 
the German DAX index closed up 19.78 points ( 0.55 percent ) at a record 3,595.15 . 
in later post-bourse electronic dealings , the IBIS index was down 21.63 points at 3,571.51 . 
the dollar stood at 1.6967 marks compared with 1.7035 late in Europe on Monday and 119.12 yen versus 118.86 . 
gold was at $ 348.65 an ounce after a morning fixing at $ 347.30 and closing at $ 348.75 in London on Monday . 
silver was down two cents at $ 4.86 . 
( $ = 1.705 German Marks )
