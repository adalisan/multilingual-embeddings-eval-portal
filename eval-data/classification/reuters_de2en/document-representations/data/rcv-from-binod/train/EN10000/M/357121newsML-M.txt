the first-ever Palestinian stock market will open for business after the three-day Moslem feast of EID al-Fitr which starts this weekend , Palestine Securities Exchange ( PSE ) general manager Safwan Bataina said on Wednesday . 
&quot; The exchange will begin its formal trading immediately after the EID and it will hold trading sessions once a week in the beginning , &quot; Bataina said . 
he was speaking after signing an agreement with Arab Bank , the largest in the West Bank , which will act as a clearing house . 
&quot; The Arab Bank has been contracted to act as a settlement bank by which the bank will transfer net payments between the brokerage firms and guarantee these payments to be made on settlement day , &quot; he said . 
bourse officials said the electronic exchange , which hopes to attract expatriate Palestinian investors , was designed to ensure maximum transparency . 
Shukri Bishara , Arab Bank regional director for the West Bank and Gaza Strip , said the clearing agreement would be an added incentive to expatriate Palestinians to invest in the economy of the West Bank and Gaza Strip on a long-term basis . 
the Arab Bank is one of the largest banks in the Arab world . 
Bataina said 30 companies have applied for listing on the stock exchange and 10 have completed listing requirements . 
he said a total of 60 companies with capitalisation of 700 million Jordanian dinars ( about $ 1 billion ) will eventually be listed on the exchange . 
four brokerage firms have been accredited to handle trading and three others are in the process of applying . 
the bourse will be run on a centralised order-driven system and has been equipped with technology enabling investors to trade and monitor investments from anywhere in the world . 
Bataina said eight traders from four brokerage firms had undergone training on trading , clearing and settlement .
