world oil prices hit new post-Gulf war highs for the second day running on Tuesday on worries over tight supplies of heating oil in the run-up to winter and supported by chart-based technical buying . 
North Sea Brent crude futures on London &apos;s International Petroleum Exchange rose by eight cents to close on the day at $ 24.57 after briefly touching the high of $ 24.70 a barrel . 
on Monday the November Brent crude oil contract soared 69 cents to the previous record of $ 24.50 , settling just one cent lower at the close . 
Tuesday &apos;s peak was the highest price for near-month crude since a high of $ 31.20 was reached in January 1991 , when U.S.-led forces began their offensive against Iraqi occupying troops in Kuwait . 
&quot; There &apos;s not as much crude around as people expected , &quot; said Geoff Pyne , oil analyst at investment bank UBS , explaining the current strong market . 
&quot; In the short term there doesn &apos;t seem to be anything to get the market back down . 
maybe in 1997 there will be a change , but not now , &quot; he added . 
&quot; The outlook is firm for this quarter , but supplies are building and it &apos;s only a matter of how long it will last . 
Pyne and other analysts and traders said concern about low U.S. heating oil stocks was continuing to drive the market after they were caught short by last year &apos;s bitterly cold winter in the northeastern United States . 
&quot; heating oil prices have gone up even faster than crude . 
it &apos;s the major impetus for the market , &quot; said Pyne . 
the worries were exacerbated by the first chill of winter in the northeastern U.S. last weekend , with heating oil stocks about one third down from last year . 
also seen as bullish was an International Energy Agency ( IEA ) report on Tuesday which forecast global oil demand in the fourth quarter at a record 73.7 million barrels per day ( bpd ) , a 100,000 bpd upward revision from last month &apos;s estimate . 
a robust U.S. economy and fierce demand in countries such as India , South Korea and Brazil could boost global oil consumption even more . 
&quot; We think the IEA will have to make further upward revisions to demand as the year goes on , &quot; said Mehdi Varzi , oil analyst at Kleinwort Benson in London . 
year on year , the world &apos;s thirst for oil is expected to rise by a sharp 1.7 million bpd in 1996 and 1.8 million next year , the IEA said .
