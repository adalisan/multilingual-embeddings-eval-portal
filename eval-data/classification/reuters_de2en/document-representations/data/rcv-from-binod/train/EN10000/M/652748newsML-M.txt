the Russian Central Bank said on Wednesday it was continuing to buy dollars as it has done over the last two months , but demand for roubles was not great despite a rise this week in rouble money market rates . 
overnight rouble rates have risen to 25-30 percent over the last two days , and hit 40 percent late on Tuesday , compared with a normal 1-10 percent , with demand for roubles fuelled by payments of tax arrears by Russian corporations . 
&quot; We are not refusing the banks , and are buying currency without limits , as long as the agent banks meet our conditions , &quot; Central Bank First Deputy Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko said . 
&quot; The situation today is fairly normal , from time to time there &apos;s a jump in rates and it &apos;s caused by banks trying to hold on to hard currency despite the current steady demand for roubles , &quot; he told Reuters . 
the rouble has been steady , with fluctuations , since late May , and on Wednesday roubles for today settlement were even quoted at 5,758 / 59 per dollar , outside the Central Bank &apos;s daily intervention band of 5,760 / 5,802 . 
Central Bank officials have already warned banks against speculating on the likelihood of a sharp fall in the rouble by holding on to dollars . 
Aleksashenko said banks were not actively requesting Lombard credits from the Central Bank , despite the tightness in the money market . 
Russia &apos;s net international reserves doubled in April and rose by a third in May , as the Central Bank bought dollars heavily in the currency market and the rouble steadied .
