Michael Jordan , the NBA &apos;s leading scorer at more than 30 points a game who turns 34 next month , said he will likely return to play for at least another season , a newspaper reported on Thursday . 
in an interview with the Chicago Tribune , Jordan said he was playing his best basketball , fuelled by the appreciation and respect of the fans , making it likely he would be back for his 12th professional season . 
&quot; At this moment , I look forward to playing next year , &quot; Jordan told the Tribune after Tuesday &apos;s Chicago bulls victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies . 
Jordan &apos;s current one-year contract with the bulls pays him $ 30 million and he has said he would prefer to stay in Chicago . 
Jordan is the leading vote-getter among players chosen by fans to play in the upcoming NBA All-Star game . 
he was coming off a season where he won the league &apos;s Most valuable Player award and his team captured their fourth championship in six years and set a record for most regular-season victories . 
Jordan has modified his game as he has gotten older , shooting more fadeaway jump shots and venturing less often to the basket for crowd-pleasing drives .
