Jack Nicklaus admits that golf &apos;s next generation will be in the spotlight in this week &apos;s PGA Championship but he is not so sure that one of the game &apos;s emerging young stars will be in the winner &apos;s circle on Sunday . 
the leaders of the game &apos;s new youth movement will take center stage when &quot; Twentysomethings &quot; Tiger Woods , Ernie Els and Justin Leonard play together in the first two rounds of the PGA Championship . 
the question is whether one of the three Young Turks -- who each won one of the year &apos;s first three major championships -- can win a second major this season at famed Winged Foot Golf Club . 
Nicklaus , whose unapproachable 18 victories in majors makes him an expert , acknowledges that Woods , Els and Leonard -- all in their 20s -- are the forefront of a new era in golf , although they may not be ready to take over completely . 
&quot; All guards change , &quot; the 57-year-old Nicklaus said on the eve of the PGA Championship , which he has won a record-tying five times . 
&quot; My guard &apos;s changed two or three times , &quot; the still-competitive Nicklaus joked . 
&quot; My opinion is that this golf course takes a little more experience to play , &quot; he said of Winged Foot , which has hosted four U.S. 
opens , including the 1974 championship which is still remembered as &quot; The Massacre at Winged Foot . 
while the 6,987-yard , par-70 West Course at Winged Foot has been set up to resemble an Open course -- narrow fairways , deep rough and punishing par-4s -- Nicklaus thinks the rolling greens will be the true test . 
&quot; These greens are about as difficult a set of greens as I &apos;ve ever seen , &quot; said Nicklaus , who will be playing in his 152nd major championship and his 36th consecutive PGA . 
&quot; Maybe one of the young players will win because there is so much talent in the young players , but I look for a little bit more experienced player to win here . 
while Nicklaus -- who is often credited with inventing &quot; power &quot; golf -- admits that long-hitters will always have an advantage , he thinks it takes more than power to win the big ones . 
&quot; It &apos;s a game for powerful players , but experience still counts for a lot when it comes to the major championships -- it always has , &quot; Nicklaus said . 
still , Nicklaus admits that the 21-year-old Woods , who broke his scoring record in winning the Masters by a record 12 shots , is leading a new generation of golfers to the fore . 
Nicklaus , the most dominant golfer of his generation by far , knows there is no stopping the youth movement , which also includes Els , 27 , who won his second U.S. Open in June , Leonard , 25 , who won the British Open last month , and Phil Mickelson , 27 , the first golfer since Nicklaus to win 10 tour events by the age of 26 . 
&quot; I think the best thing that happened for the game was Tiger winning at Augusta , &quot; said Nicklaus , who has predicted that Woods will win more Masters than he ( six ) and Arnold Palmer ( four ) together . 
Nicklaus went so far as to compare Woods -- already the most successful black golfer ever -- to Palmer , who is credited with creating an enormous surge in golf &apos;s popularity in the 1950s and 1960s . 
&quot; I sort of liken what Tiger did to what Arnold did in many ways , &quot; Nicklaus said . 
&quot; This man comes out with the potential to dominate , much like Arnold did . 
but then Arnold needed challenges , too , and Gary ( Player of South Africa ) came along -- and I came along . 
&quot; What it &apos;s doing , it &apos;s making all the other players play harder . 
they &apos;re going to have to bring their games up a level if they want to compete with this young man . 
&quot; But you also have found that there are other players who can play , too . 
the PGA Championship &apos;s big silver trophy will be waiting for one of them on Sunday .
