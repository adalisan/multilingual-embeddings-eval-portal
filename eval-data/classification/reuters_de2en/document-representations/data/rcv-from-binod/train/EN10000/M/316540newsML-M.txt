Germany &apos;s blue chip DAX index opened bourse trade on Friday at a historic high , finally breaching its long-targeted threshold of 3,000 points . 
a strongly positive environment -- fresh records on Wall Street and the dollar &apos;s rise above 1.60 marks -- and upward pressure due to the expiry of DAX options triggered the ascent which left dealers jubilant at reaching 3,000 at last . 
the DAX index was up 14.07 points at 3,007.38 points about forty minutes into the floor session , with almost all blue chip stocks contributing to the advance . 
&quot; It &apos;s a guessing game now to see where we will end up , but I &apos;m confident it will be between 3,000 and 3,025 points , &quot; said a Munich dealer . 
dealers had been seeking all week to push the DAX over 3,000 but failed repeatedly despite coming as close as two points to the target on Thursday . 
while the level has limited technical implications , it a key psychological boost . 
Bank stocks continued to lead the advance . 
&quot; A lot of the new money is going into financials now , especially the foreign money , &quot; a trader commented , noting that banks had underperformed last year . 
Daimler-Benz AG was up 2.30 marks at 117.90 marks as the market took in its stride news released Thursday of the imminent departure of Mercedes chief Helmut Werner over a disagreement on a management restructure plan . 
&quot; This is certainly not a negative for Daimler . 
of course Werner is a great man but people will still have a high opinion of Daimler , &quot; the Munich trader commented . 
the main exception was retailer Karstadt AG which has been under pressure for some days . 
dealers said concerns about the company &apos;s profits had been exacerbated by an earnings downgrade by a respected bank . 
the stock was down three marks at 484 in early trade . 
however not all traders were euphoric and some were sceptical that the DAX &apos;s current rally can continue . 
&quot; Of course we are happy to see the 3,000 mark but it doesn &apos;t mean the start of anything big , &quot; said one Frankfurt dealer , who said a consolidation would inevitably begin soon .
