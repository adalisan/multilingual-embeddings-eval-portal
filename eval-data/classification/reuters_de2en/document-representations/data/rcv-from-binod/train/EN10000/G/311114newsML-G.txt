Italian serie A soccer league club Lazio said on Thursday that it wanted to be the country &apos;s first to be listed on the bourse . 
Sergio Cragnotti , owner of Lazio and president of Cirio Finanziaria , said he wanted a bourse listing . 
&quot; I am working to take Lazio on to the bourse as soon as possible , possibly in June , before the summer , &quot; he said . 
he said his staff was working to answer questions raised by bourse watchdog Consob and would reply next week . 
news reports that Juventus , who are serie A leaders , and other top Italian clubs could go public have been rife in recent months following successful flotations by English clubs . 
however , a flotation in Italy is problematic because most clubs do not meet disclosure rules applicable on the Milan bourse or requirements for three straight years of profit prior to a listing , share analysts say .
