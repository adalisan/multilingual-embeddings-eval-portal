campaign fundraising investigations have cost the Democratic National Committee about $ 7.7 million so far this year , depleting coffers ahead of the 1998 elections , attorneys said Wednesday . 
about $ 1.8 million was paid and another $ 5.9 million was still owed for costs related to legal fees , copying , document production and computer scanning , Joseph Sandler , general counsel for the Democratic National Committee , said . 
Congress and the Justice Department are investigating allegations that foreign countries may have sought to influence the 1996 presidential and congressional elections with campaign contributions . 
the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) has sent about 120 boxes of documents containing about 275,000 pages to each of the Senate and House committees conducting the investigation , said DNC attorneys , who complained the information requested by the committees was too broad in scope . 
&quot; Almost $ 3 million has been judged by the DNC themselves to be illegal or improper or questionable at best and they &apos;ve returned it to givers , &quot; Paul Clark , spokesman for the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee , said . 
&quot; In order to find out what happened in the 1996 cycle ... we need to subpoena documents and testimony , &quot; he said . 
the Commitee , chaired by Tennessee Republican Fred Thompson , planned to start four weeks of hearings on campaign financing next week . 
&quot; We continually ask both the House and the Senate committees to narrow the scope of their subpoenas , &quot; DNC special counsel Peter Kadzik said . 
&quot; The amount of resources that it takes to gather those documents ... is going to cost the Democratic National Committee millions of dollars and is going to obviously deplete its resources as it prepares for the 1998 election , &quot; he said . 
&quot; And we believe that part of the reason why the scope of these subpoenas is so broad is to impose that burden on the Democratic National Committee rather than further any legitimate investigative needs . 
the subpoena for information had 45 questions and one of those related to 117 people , attorneys said . 
the DNC has hired 17 additional staff dedicated to compiling documents requested for the investigations , they said . 
the DNC was also paying legal expenses for current and former officers but not for former Democratic fundraiser John Huang , and all the documents related to Huang were sent to the committees early on , the attorneys said . 
&quot; Basically it &apos;s not going to be a firecracker , it &apos;s just going to sort of be a small pop , &quot; lawyer Judah Best said of the Senate hearings . 
Kadzik , however , did acknowledge : &quot; We messed up . 
&quot; With respect to certain contributions that came into the party we should have done a better job of vetting them at the time that they came in , &quot; he said . 
the DNC also accused the Senate committee of &quot; leaking &quot; information to the press related to the investigation . 
asked about leaks from the White House and the DNC ahead of the hearings , Kadzik replied those were not leaks but &quot; disclosure .
