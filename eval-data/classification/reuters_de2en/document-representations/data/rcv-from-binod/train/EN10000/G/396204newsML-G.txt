Beijing movie theatres have postponed a festival of films on the life of Deng Xiaoping after two nights of dismal ticket sales , theatre managers said on Saturday . 
the city &apos;s theatres originally announced that from February 20 to 25 , every screen in the capital would be devoted to rolling over six movies about Deng , who died on Wednesday after serving as China &apos;s supreme leader for almost two decades . 
on Saturday , however , managers at several theatres said they were temporarily taking Deng off their marquees in the face of poor customer response to tales of his revolutionary exploits . 
&quot; We sold one ticket , &quot; one manager said , noting that the same films -- government-produced propaganda blockbusters such as &quot; decisive battles &quot; -- had been running almost continuously on television since Deng &apos;s death was announced . 
another manager said his theatre would simply close until February 26 , the day after Deng &apos;s official funeral is held in Beijing . 
&quot; Then we can start showing some other movies , &quot; he said .
