but news from outside the bourse floor dominated the session , as the Slovak parliament approved a new securities law after amending it by removing several controversial paragraphs that analysts said could prove disastrous for the market . 
&quot; I expect it ( the market ) will begin to rise on the news of the amendments very soon , &quot; Libor Briska of Creditanstalt said . 
he said the new version of law , which omits a paragraph allowing majority shareholders to arbitrarily suspend trading of an issue could bring more transparency to the market since it forces trading onto accredited bourses . 
&quot; Most share prices seem pretty attractive at the moment , and I think the new law may also contribute to a market &apos;s revival , &quot; he added . 
overall volume eased to 721,245 shares , from 1,181,706 shares traded on Monday , while turnover , boosted by direct trades , increased to 559.95 million crowns , from 299.62 million .
