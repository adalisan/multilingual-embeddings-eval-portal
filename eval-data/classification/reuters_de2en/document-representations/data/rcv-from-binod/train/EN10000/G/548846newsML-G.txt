police in Hong Kong and China plan to launch a joint exercise in the middle of May to counter a growing tide of illegal immigrants from mainland China , Hong Kong police said on Tuesday . 
&quot; Yes , the exercise is sometime in mid-May , to tackle human smuggling , &quot; a police spokeswoman said . 
she gave no details of the exercise which will be staged only a few weeks before Britain &apos;s handover of Hong Kong to China . 
a local newspaper , Ming Pao reported the joint exercise would be staged from May 17 to 19 and would involve 1,500 people from the military and police forces . 
the land and sea exercise would also involve a fleet of over 50 vessels , Ming Pao said , quoting police over the border in the Chinese city of Shenzhen . 
the number of mainland Chinese entering Hong Kong illegally has risen in recent months , fuelled by rumours in southern China that they will be given amnesty after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule on July 1 . 
many of them are children and are believed to have rights to live in the territory as they have either one or both parents in Hong Kong . 
frustrated by the long wait to complete formalities , many risk their lives to make the journey illegally . 
the Hong Kong government has repeatedly said that there will be no amnesty and anyone caught will be sent back . 
Hong Kong plice arrested 1,367 illegal Chinese migrants in the first quarter of 1997 against 90 in the same period in 1996 .
