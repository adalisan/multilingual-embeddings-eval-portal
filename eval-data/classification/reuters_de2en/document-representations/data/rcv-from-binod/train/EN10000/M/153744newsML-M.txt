prospects for deliveries Thursday , first notice day for deliveries on the November contract , knocked CBOT soybean futures to a lower close , traders said . 
&quot; That &apos;s what broke the market , that and local selling . 
there should be two to three million beans tomorrow for delivery , &quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds . 
traders said there was talk Continental grain Thursday may post up to three million bushels of soybeans for delivery on the November . 
soybean registrations increased Wednesday to 2.48 million in Chicago , according to the CBOT . 
pressure came from technical selling when January failed to penetrate the $ 7.00 per bushel mark during the opening . 
&quot; There was selling at $ 7.00 in the January , &quot; said Mark Cermak of O &apos;Connor and Co . 
the session high for January was $ 6.99-1 / 2 , below first resistance in that month at roughly $ 7.02-1 / 2 , according to technical traders . 
first support was at $ 6.94 per bushel and second support was $ 6.87 . 
the session low was $ 6.89-1 / 2 . 
soybeans closed 1 / 2 to nine cents per bushel lower , with November down nine at $ 6.89-1 / 2 . 
Wednesday &apos;s volume was relatively modest but aggressive spread trading was noted . 
&quot; It &apos;s the spreads . 
all day we were influenced by how poorly the spreads traded . 
also more people are talking about the increase in registrations , &quot; said Mark Cermak of O &apos;Connor and Co . 
Cargill Inc did five million bushels of November / January , Term commodities did 2.5 million January / November and Refco Inc did three million January / November , traders said . 
Cargill Inc was a net buyer of five million bushels of November , they said . 
prospects for a hike in estimates for U.S. 1996 soybean crop production also weighed on the market . 
traders said USDA &apos;s November 12 crop production report could show an increase in U.S. soybean production from the government &apos;s outlook in October for 2.346 billion bushels . 
also there was talk a recent IRS ruling would not have much of an impact on the way farmers market their crop . 
there were rumblings Tuesday that producers may choose to store rather than sell soybeans due to tax implications . 
the market shrugged off potential bullish input from windy and wet weather in the U.S. Midwest . 
long liquidation hit the November with the open interest ( OI ) in that contract considered relatively large for this stage of the contract &apos;s life . 
preliminary CBOT data showed open interest in the November before trading began Wednesday at 185.3 million bushels , down 38.2 million from the tally early Tuesday . 
but it still represented nearly 21.5 percent of the total OI in soybeans at 863.2 million bushels . 
traders also said the soybean market was operating under the weight of expectations for a decline in weekly U.S. soybean export sales . 
&quot; There &apos;s certainly not the business this week we saw last week . 
business continues to be quiet , &quot; Cermak said . 
Cermak said there was talk USDA &apos;s weekly export sales report , slated for release at 0730 CST Thursday , would show from 400,000 to 600,000 tonnes of soybeans sold during the latest reporting week . 
that tally would still be a respectable amount , he said , but is well below the strong pace of roughly 1.4 million the previous week . 
short term technical indictors showed November moving down to near oversold status with the nine day relative strength index ( RSI ) closing at 35.3 points . 
traders generally consider an RSI of 30 or less as indicative of an oversold market . 
but technicians reported the key moving averages indicate soybeans remain in a bearish mode . 
soybean futures volume was estimated at 70,000 contracts , down from 85,601 Tuesday , according to the CBOT . 
in soybean options , Continental grain bought 600 March $ 6.50 puts and sold 600 March $ 7.75 calls at 1 / 2 cent , First America bought 200 January $ 6.75 puts at 9-9-1 / 2 cents and Smith Barney bought 200 March $ 6.50 puts at 6-1 / 2 cents , traders said . 
soybean options volume was estimated at 14,000 contracts , up from 12,664 Tuesday .
