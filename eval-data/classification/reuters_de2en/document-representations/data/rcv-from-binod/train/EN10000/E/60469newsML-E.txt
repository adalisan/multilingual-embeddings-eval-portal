the U.S. House Commerce Committee on Wednesday approved a bill that to give more states more flexibility in how they spend federal money to clean up leaking underground storage tanks . 
the bill , which passed on a voice vote with bipartisan support , would make the Environmental Protection Agency give 85 percent of its leaking underground storage tank funds each year to states to help them manage cleanups . 
the agency on average already gives states 86 percent of its oil tank funds , but states are restricted to using the money to oversee cleanups or fund cleanup when an owner or operator could not be identified . 
the bill would allow states to use funds to help tank owners and operators comply with new tank requirements coming into effect in 1998 and help those who cannot afford cleanup costs without going out of business . 
seepage from underground tanks is the most common source of groundwater contamination in many states , according to EPA .
