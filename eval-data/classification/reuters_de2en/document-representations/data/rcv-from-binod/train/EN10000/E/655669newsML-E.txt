Poland &apos;s budget , stretched to the point of temporarily losing liquidity last week , is a warning flare for the finance ministry but does not signal serious financial trouble , analysts said on Thursday . 
they said the budget should get much needed relief in the second half of the year as revenues rise along with larger income tax inflows as tax-payers move to higher tax brackets . 
&quot; Even though the second half of the year should bring in higher budget revenues , this is a warning signal , &quot; said Tadeusz Chroscicki , head analyst of the government &apos;s Centre for Strategic Studies ( CSS ) . 
no cash in the treasury &apos;s coffers caused the ministry to delay wages for some public sector workers at the end of last week and put Finance Minister Marek Belka on the defensive . 
&quot; We are not threatened by a budget crisis ... ( and ) by Friday all back payments will be made , &quot; , &quot; Belka said on Wednesday . 
the rapid decline of inflation over the first months of 1997 reduced inflows to the budget , which , according to analysts , is already tight . 
&quot; For the first time in years there is no inflation premium , which increases budget revenues while expenditures stay fixed as written into budget law , &quot; said Bohdan Wyznikiewicz , deputy head of the independent Gdansk Institute for Market Economics . 
inflation fell to about year-on-year 15 percent in May from 18.5 percent at the end of last year and some forecast Poland meeting the budget envisioned 13-percent price growth target for this year , a feet not yet accomplished in Poland &apos;s seven year economic transformation from central planning . 
CSS &apos;s Chroscicki said that this year &apos;s budget woes were further strengthened by some 1.5 billion zlotys of tax deductions coming from tax-reducing donations . 
last year this tax law loop hole , which allows tax-payers to deduct up to 15 percent of their income through donating gifts to family members , cost the state about 900 million zlotys , Chroscicki added . 
after the first five months of 1997 , Poland &apos;s budget gap reached 53.8 percent of the 12.22 billion zloty shortfall planned for the whole of year , according to preliminary data from the finance ministry . 
budget revenues in the January-May period amounted to 35.3 percent of this year &apos;s plan while spending in the same period reached 37.1 percent 
in the corresponding period of 1996 revenues reached 36.1 percent of last year &apos;s plan , spending 37.5 percent and the deficit amounted to 51.9 percent .
