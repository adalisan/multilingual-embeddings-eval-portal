platinum and palladium are at fresh highs on Wednesday amid persistant concerns about Russian supplies and will remain severely volatile for now , traders and analysts said . 
platinum faced resistance at $ 425 and then $ 4.35 . 
gold and silver were seen rangebound . 
platinum - Prices soared to $ 431 an ounce on Wednesday morning -- the highest since February 1996 -- before easing back following fresh news on Russian supplies . 
prices had started climbing in New York on Tuesday and continued in the Far East and early Europe , bursting past the recent high of $ 425 . 
but the market paused after traders said Russia &apos;s PGM export agency Almazjuvelirexport had told Japanese clients that exports under 1997 term contracts were expected to begin around June 20 . 
traders said the market was still short and remained very unpredictable , with wild swings between $ 400 and $ 435 liable to erupt as fresh news emerged . 
platinum was last indicated at around $ 418 , compared to the London close of $ 415 / $ 419 . 
palladium - Prices similarly zoomed to new highs dating back at least to 1980 in a very tight , jittery market which traders said was still short . 
if there are no lenders around all you can do its borrow the stuff at very high lease rates or buy material , which has been driving the price up , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; It has really started to bite now , &quot; he added . 
palladium was down from a high of $ 218 , but at around $ 207 / $ 215 , it was still sharply higher than Tuesday &apos;s London close . 
gold - Despite tremendous volatility in the platinum metals , gold has remained tightly rangebound in a wider $ 341- $ 347 band for weeks . 
traders said it would stay that way for now as platinum and palladium took precedence in the market . 
&quot; Gold is still in a tight range of $ 343- $ 345 and it &apos;s barely moving , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; It &apos;s possible that it is holding steady because of stronger palladium , because otherwise the news from Germany should be bearish , &quot; he added , referring to the German plan to revalue gold reserves . 
silver - strictly rangebound for now , but the market is seen in a wider $ 4.60- $ 4.85 range in the near term . 
a near-convergence of the 10- and 30-day moving averages in the $ 4.73- $ 4.74 area may help underpin the market just above that level , traders said . 
it was last at $ 4.76 / $ 4.78 , little changed from Tuesday &apos;s New York close .
