Vice-President Al Gore , touring the Korean Demilitarised Zone following top-level talks in Seoul , said on Saturday he believed North Korea was nearing collapse . 
standing at Observation Post Ouelette , gazing across at North Korean territory , Gore was asked for his thoughts about tensions with one of the last communist nations . 
&quot; It &apos;s still real here , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The Cold War survives but perhaps not for long because their system is collapsing . 
Gore inspected sites manned by U.S. forces in the Demilitarised Zone ( DMZ ) separating North and South after holding talks in Seoul with South Korean President Kim Young-sam . 
the two-hour discussions at the presidential Blue House included an update on U.S. and South Korean efforts to convince North Korea to join four-nation peace talks . 
a senior U.S. official who took part in the talks said both men had spoken of the need for a unified position in dealing with North Korea . 
&quot; There is a sense that you have to treat this with great care , &quot; the official said . 
asked to elaborate on Gore &apos;s comment on the North &apos;s pending collapse , the official said : &quot; There is growing evidence of a crisis that is getting worse . 
the United States has been trying to convince North Korea to accept a proposal for four-way talks between North and South Korea , the United States and China that was proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Kim in April last year . 
the four-way talks would be aimed initially at securing a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the 1950-1953 Korean War . 
Washington , which led the United Nations force which battled North Korean and Chinese armies during that conflict , still keeps 37,000 troops in South Korea under a defence pact . 
the United States believes a treaty would serve as a springboard for finally ending tensions on the peninsula . 
Gore , who spent five days in China before arriving in Korea on Friday , discussed the mooted four-way talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin , U.S. officials said . 
according to officials in Seoul , Pyongyang has made a first formal response to the call for talks by insisting the United States and South Korea promise first to supply it with urgently needed food supplies . 
North Korea has suffered severe food shortages after two consecutive years of devastating floods , according to international relief experts . 
Seoul officials say that by linking food aid to the talks , Pyongyang had revealed its desperation . 
Washington and Seoul have been cool to accepting preconditions for the talks , but both governments say they are sympathetic to North Korea &apos;s humanitarian needs . 
according to a senior U.S. official involved in Gore &apos;s talks with Kim , &quot; the United States and South Korea are not willing to have a precondition for entry into four-party talks &quot; . 
he said , however , that North Korea had been told that , if it participates in the talks , &quot; there will be a great deal of good will ... good things will happen . 
the official , noting that the United States had already supplied humanitarian aid to the North , said it was prepared to send additional supplies once talks begin . 
while Gore was in South Korea , a five-member delegation of U.S. senators , led by Ted Stevens , the chairman of the Senate appropriations Committee , were in Pyongyang for talks . 
the delegation led by Ted Stevens , chairman of the Senate appropriations Committee , met President Kim Young-sam before leaving on their mission . 
accompanying Stevens were Republicans Pete Domenici of New Mexico , Thad Cochran of Mississippi , Pat Roberts of Kansas and Democrat Daniel Inouye of Hawaii .
