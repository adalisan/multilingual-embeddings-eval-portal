emerging market debt prices were narrowly mixed in an extremely thin market as players awaited key U.S. economic data due out Friday . 
&quot; I think contrary to the equity markets , our markets have been very quiet . 
I think everyone is waiting on tomorrow &apos;s figures , &quot; said Kurt Schmid , managing director of emerging markets trading at SBC Warburg in New York . 
market experts said the March U.S. employment report will provide a much clearer picture of whether the Federal Reserve will need to raise interest rates further . 
&quot; Very clearly , if the market anticipates that there is not just one tightening move by the Fed in May but a couple thereafter , it could lead to further corrections and I think tomorrow &apos;s figure and particularly hourly earnings will set the tone for the time being , &quot; said Schmid . 
according to a Reuters poll , U.S. economists forecast U.S. payrolls rose by 196,000 in March , down from 339,000 new jobs in February . 
though the upgrade of Argentina and Brazil by Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s on Wednesday continued to receive wide applause by the market , trading sources said the news was clearly overshadowed by nervousness about the upcoming jobs report . 
&quot; Clearly the market &apos;s reaction to the upgrades was muted because everyone is waiting to see what the picture is for the interest rate scenario , &quot; said one emerging markets trader at a major U.S. investment house . 
&quot; In spite of the fact that it was probably anticipated , it was very good news , &quot; said Schmid who noted , however , that the price gains were relatively insignificant . 
Schmid said that if the upgrades by S &amp; P had been done in a firm market , the news probably would have driven prices up about one to two percentage points on both Argentine and Brazilian debt instruments . 
among Eastern European debt , Bulgaria IAB &apos;s rose 1 / 8 to 57-3 / 4 bid , while Russian Vneshekonombank dollar loans fell 7 / 8 to 77-1 / 8 bid .
