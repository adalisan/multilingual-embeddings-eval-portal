the European Union loses up to 30 billion Ecus ( $ 34.5 billion ) in revenue from smuggled goods and forged documents , according to the findings of a European Parliament investigation . 
&quot; Fraud concerning goods brought into the market-place in Europe could ( be ) 30 billion Ecus , &quot; said Edward Kellet-Bowman , the author of the inquiry &apos;s report . 
the probe , begun in December 1995 , was the first under new investigative powers granted to the EU assembly under the 1992 Maastricht Treaty . 
criminals were making &quot; vast profits &quot; from the EU &apos;s archaic paper-based transit system , Kellet-Bowman told a news conference . 
the system allows goods lorries to transit EU member states tax free , only paying customs duties , value-added tax and excise duties at their final destination outside the Union . 
but the report says many operators forge their documents and offload cigarettes , alcohol and other high value goods on the EU market . 
the goods never arrive in the city where the taxes must be paid . 
abuse of the system -- designed in the 1960s for six EU members but now handling 18 million operations a year in the 15 EU states and eight neighbouring countries -- has blown huge holes in EU and national budgets , Kellet-Bowman said . 
the black market in cigarettes , which accounts for up to 25 percent of all sales in some member states , was destroying legal traders , the British Conservative added . 
his report calls for the swift introduction of a computerised transit document system and its extension from road to maritime transport . 
John Tomlinson , who chaired the committee of inquiry , criticised the EU states for their reluctance to replace their fragmented national customs services by a unified system and for failing to recognise computerisation was in their own interest . 
&quot; While they are arguing about who pays for it ... the citizens of the member states are losing out , &quot; he said , adding that the EU was prepared to foot half the 50-million-Ecu bill . 
Switzerland &apos;s lax transit rules were undermining the system still further , Tomlinson said . 
it was not for nothing that a quarter of all transit lorries passed through Switzerland , even cargoes of American cigarettes arriving in Antwerp and destined for Azerbaijan , he said . 
Kellet-Bowman said the member states must step up controls at the EU &apos;s external borders -- including coasts and airports -- and that involved training and paying customs officers properly . 
&quot; People who are paid ( low wages ) with these great containers of wealth passing them by are subject to temptation , &quot; he said .
