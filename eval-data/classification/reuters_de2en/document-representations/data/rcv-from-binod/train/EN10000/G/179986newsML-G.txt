the Colombian government this week may sidestep congressional stalling and use special powers to force through stiffer anti-drug laws , Justice Minister Carlos Medellin said . 
in comments to local media over the weekend , he also called for the draft laws -- which include confiscating drug barons &apos; ill-gotten gains -- to be retroactive , applying to traffickers already jailed . 
the retroactivity issue has sparked controversy in parallel moves to end Colombia &apos;s constitutional ban on extradition , currently under debate in the senate . 
former justice minister Enrique Parejo believes lawmakers may welcome the decree since it would remove them from the line of fire in any violent backlash by drug traffickers . 
&quot; If we don &apos;t do something soon then it could be too late . 
if congress does not make headway on the confiscation ( of drug traffickers &apos; property ) then I will be looking for the faculty to introduce the legal measures , &quot; Medellin told the conservative El Nuevo Siglo newspaper . 
President Ernesto Samper submitted the tougher anti-drug proposals to congress in July with a firm eye on winning back U.S. certification as an ally in the drugs war , which was withdrawn in March . 
he has sent repeated requests to legislators to speed up debate , but sessions continue to be dogged by lengthy political wrangling and poor attendance , which has left committees without a quorum . 
if the congress fails to pass the measures , the government is expected to announce a decision by Thursday to introduce the new anti-drug laws by decree . 
but political and legal analysts say the move could raise constitutional issues about whether the government has the right to override congress . 
&quot; The government wants to legislate by decree because it fears decertification by the United States again next year , which could spark a fresh crisis which it may not recover from , &quot; Parejo said in a telephone interview . 
&quot; It may be a relief to many congressmen who have links with drug traffickers because there are real signs that the cartels are once again preparing to unleash a new war . 
in the 1980s and early 1990s , the late Pablo Escobar , head of the once-mighty Medellin drug cartel , waged a war of bombings , assassinations and kidnaps against the state in a successful bid to get extradition banned . 
the specter of a similar terror campaign is again looming after a series of bombings in recents weeks , including one defused by police which had been planted by the so-called Movement for National Sovereignty in the centre of Cali .
