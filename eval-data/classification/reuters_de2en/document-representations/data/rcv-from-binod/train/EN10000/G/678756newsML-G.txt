up to 500 Northern Ireland police separated rival Protestant and Catholic demonstrators on Sunday to prevent any clashes during marches in the flashpoint town of Bellaghy . 
police said the march passed peacefully after they formed a buffer zone and blocked rival parades . 
&quot; We have no reports of any bother anywhere , &quot; a police spokesman said . 
Protestants of the powerful Orange Order , a civil organisation with its roots in pro-British Protestant loyalties , handed a letter of protest to a senior policeman accusing Britain of breaching their human rights . 
a Catholic leader told reporters that security measures were &quot; a curfew of the nationalist people &quot; and blamed the Protestants for parading through the overwhelmingly pro-Irish town . 
the Bellaghy parade was one of the first of the Protestant marching season , which police had feared could cause a re-run of last year &apos;s violence , the worst in the province for decades . 
millions of pounds ( dollars ) of damage was caused in a showdown between members of the 60 per cent Protestant majority and 40 per cent Catholic minority whose conflicting British and Irish loyalties are the heart of the Northern Ireland conflict . 
the season reaches a climax in the first two weeks of July , when Protestants celebrate centuries-old battlefield victories over Catholics which entrenched a Protestant pro-British majority in what became Northern Ireland . 
local Catholics in Bellaghy , which is south of the province &apos;s second city , Londonderry , had said they would hold a 12-hour counter demonstration at what they see as attempts to intimidate them by the majority pro-British community . 
Northern Ireland police chief Ronnie Flanagan on Sunday praised a decision by one Catholic priest to end a Saturday night service at Harryville , north of Belfast , which has been the centre of Protestant protest for more than 40 weeks . 
the priest , Canon Sean Connolly of Our Lady &apos;s Church , said that he would cancel the service until September , when the annual marching season ends , in the hope of defusing tension . 
Flanagan said : &quot; It is a really genuine and sincere effort to reduce tension and I would like to see that regard for others being repeated . 
Harryville was picketed by pro-British Protestant loyalists for weeks in protest at the refusal of Catholics in the nearby village of Dunloy to allow an Orange Order parade there . 
the British government , churchmen and other mediators have tried in vain to get Loyalists and Catholic nationalists to negotiate a compromise over this year &apos;s marches , but Orange Order leaders refuse to hold face-to-face talks with Catholics . 
they believe Catholic residents are being manipulated or infiltrated by activists of Sinn Fein , the political wing of Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) guerrillas fighting British rule . 
the main headache among security chiefs is the annual march from a small church at Drumcree through the Catholic Garvaghy Road area of Portadown , south of Belfast . 
Flanagan said there would be no repeat of last year &apos;s handling of the parade , which was banned until Protestant rioting forced a U-turn decision and unleashed a wave of Catholic fury in parts of the province . 
the Drumcree parade , which marks Northern Ireland soldiers who died for Britain in the World War One battle of the Somme , will be staged on July 6 , six days before the climax of the marching season , the &quot; Glorious Twelfth &quot; . 
this anniversary recalls the victories of King William of Orange over King James ll , a Catholic , in the religous wars of the late 17th century .
