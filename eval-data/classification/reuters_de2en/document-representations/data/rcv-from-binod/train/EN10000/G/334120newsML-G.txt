sacked CSKA Moscow coach Alexander Tarkhanov has taken over at city neighbours torpedo Moscow , resolving an internal dispute at the Russian army side but taking eight of their top players with him . 
officials at both clubs confirmed on Monday Tarkhanov had joined torpedo almost a month after CSKA sports chief Colonel Alexander Baranovsky dismissed him . 
Tarkhanov had initially refused to go , disputing Baranovsky &apos;s right to sack him , but finally accepted he was isolated at the club , in which the defence ministry has a large stake . 
&quot; Tarkhanov has left the team after realising he would not have any kind of support from the defence ministry , &quot; said CSKA spokesman Yuri Zemlyakov , who added Tarkhanov had taken eight players with him to torpedo . 
torpedo Moscow president Vladimir Pilgui confirmed Tarkhanov had replaced veteran coach Valentin Ivanov , who moves onto the club &apos;s board . 
Tarkhanov &apos;s place at CSKA was taken earlier this month by former Russian national team coach Pavel Sadyrin , prompting Tarkhanov &apos;s revolt . 
Russian soccer authorities gave CSKA until March 1 to settle the dispute and threatened them with relegation if they had not resolved it before the start of the 1997 season on March 15 .
