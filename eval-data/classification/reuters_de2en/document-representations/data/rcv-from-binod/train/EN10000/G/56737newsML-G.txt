shuttle Atlantis blasted off on Monday , headed for space station Mir to pick up U.S. astronaut Shannon lucid and drop off her replacement . 
the $ 2 billion spaceship , running nearly seven weeks late , roared into the Florida night sky at 4 : 54 a.m. EDT ( 0854 GMT ) , beginning a three-day chase through space to catch the Russian station . 
the shuttle &apos;s blast off sets the stage for a docking with Mir late on Wednesday . 
lucid , a 53-year-old biochemist , has been aboard the Russian space station since March and was supposed to have returned home aboard Atlantis in early August . 
the shuttle &apos;s launch , originally scheduled for July 31 , was postponed by six weeks because NASA ordered the replacement of its twin rocket boosters , fearing a dangerous flaw in the rocket &apos;s joints . 
menacing hurricanes lurking off the Florida coast forced NASA to twice haul the shuttle off its launch pad , delaying it a few more days . 
and a scheduling clash with an unmanned rocket caused a further delay .
