Psst , got any dollars you want to sell ? 
while it hasn &apos;t quite reached that stage on the back streets of Tokyo , the 50 percent fall in the yen &apos;s value in the past two years is causing some lifestyle adjustments for Japanese consumers used to snapping up luxury foreign goods and jetting around the world . 
couples on a date are a little more careful in ordering the wine , the trip to Paris is not as long as it was , or maybe not even possible , and brand-name luggage is no longer a necessity . 
sending children abroad to study is a harder decision and landlords are finding more foreigners competing for the capital &apos;s choicest appartments . 
no one suggests Japan is becoming a deprived nation . 
far from it . 
Tokyo &apos;s restaurants are still full , new luxury super-malls are opening and residents are still among the world &apos;s best dressed . 
but life in general has become a more frugal affair . 
overseas tourism , for foreigners once the most visible symbol of Japan &apos;s economic might , is gradually slowing down . 
&quot; Up to last April , the number of people travelling abroad had steadily shown a double digit increase each month . 
but since last May the rate of increase has dropped to one digit , mainly because of a weakening yen , &quot; said a spokesman for Japan Travel Bureau ( JTB ) , the country &apos;s biggest travel agent . 
&quot; The recent drop in the yen is not a bright factor for us . 
we may have to raise prices again , &quot; he said . 
last year JTB first raised prices of package tours by 3.4 percent and then increased them by a further 2.4 percent . 
&quot; We don &apos;t make any predictions but we certainly feel a weak yen is going to have a bigger and bigger negative effect on the outflow of Japanese tourists , &quot; a JNTO official said . 
Luggage-maker Louis Vuitton Japan KK , like many foreign sellers of luxury products , plans to raise prices by an average 4.5 percent from February to cope with the weak yen . 
&quot; I can &apos;t tell what effect the increases are going to have on sales , &quot; a spokeswoman said . 
not everyone is unhappy . 
a journalist for a U.S. newspaper who is paid in dollars said he counts himself among the winners from the yen &apos;s decline . 
&quot; When I came to Japan three years ago , my budget was based on 110 yen to the dollar . 
then it dropped to 80 yen , &quot; he said . 
&quot; With my rent going up and my salary dropping more than 20 percent , I started to look for another job . 
but now , at 120 yen to the dollar , the financial pressure has disappeared . 
Ken Corp , a Tokyo real estate firm specialising in apartments for foreigners , sees a similar trend . 
&quot; The number of foreigners renting apartments through us has been increasing since late last year , &quot; a company spokeswoman said . 
&quot; We believe that &apos;s because of the foreign exchange rates and a possible increase in the budgets of their companies . 
Kawachiya Shuhan Co , Japan &apos;s biggest discount liquor store chain , which sells almost all kinds of foreign brandy , whiskey , wine and beer , is not cheering . 
&quot; We have been hard-hit by the weakening yen . 
for example , we had to raise prices of French wine by 10 percent at the start of the New Year , &quot; company president Yukio Higuchi said . 
&quot; With the yen weakening to 120 or more to the dollar , we will have to raise prices again soon , &quot; he said . 
education Ministry officials , who advise Japanese on sending children abroad to study , sense the number may be dropping . 
&quot; We are still not in a position to assess the impact of the weak yen on people wanting to study abroad , &quot; one official said . 
&quot; But it is common sense that if the yen continues to weaken , the number of people who are willing and can afford to go abroad to study is likely to drop , &quot; he added .
