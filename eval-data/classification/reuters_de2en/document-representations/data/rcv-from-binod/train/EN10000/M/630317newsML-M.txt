the Bulgarian Lev closed at around 1,570-1,572 per dollar , little changed from the morning &apos;s 1,569-1,571 amid low demand for foreign currency , dealers said . 
&quot; Traders bid for levs to buy government securities at today &apos;s auctions . 
foreign currency demand from banks and clients was very low , &quot; a dealer said . 
the Finance Ministry today offered 55 billion Lev worth of five T-bill issues . 
a rise in the central bank main interest rate to 48.72 percent annually from 43.08 percent took effect on Monday . 
the central bank was seen as a main foreign currency buyer at 1,570 levs per dollar , curbing a possible Lev rise amid the higher dollar supply , traders said . 
Central bank officials were not available for comment . 
traders said they were reluctant to pare forex positions amid uncertainty whether the Lev would be pegged to the dollar or the mark , and at what exchange rate , under a currency board system . 
Bulgaria has pledged to introduce the IMF-prescribed system , a form of fixed exhange rate mechanism aimed at stabilising the economy , on July 1 . 
Bulgaria &apos;s Finance Minister Muravei Radev said on Monday Bulgaria may peg the Lev this week as part of preparations to introduce the currency board but declined to say which would be the anchor currency . 
Radev said last week that a Lev / dollar exchange rate of 1,600 or 1,000 levs per mark was assumed in this year &apos;s budget draft .
