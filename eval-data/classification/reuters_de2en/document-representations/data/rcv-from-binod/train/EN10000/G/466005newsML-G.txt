a powerful earthquake measuring five to six on the Mercali scale rocked Chilean capital Santiago on Monday , causing power cuts and panic among residents but no serious damage or injuries . 
the quake sent alarmed residents running out of their homes throughout the city when it struck at 9 : 14 p.m. local time ( 0015 GMT ) . 
the tremor had its epicenter around 48 miles ( 80 km ) beneath the center of Santiago , local officials said . 
initial measurements showed the quake measuring five to six on the Mercali scale throughout the city center , said Carmen Fernandez , head of services of the National Emergency Office . 
the Mercali scale measures the intensity of the earth &apos;s movement in a particular place , whereas the Richter scale measures the amount of energy released at the epicenter . 
the quake &apos;s intensity diminished in the areas surrounding the city , said Fernandez . 
&quot; We have not had any reports of any injuries to people , &quot; she added . 
the tremor was not felt in Chile &apos;s vital copper mines , most of which lie in the arid north . 
Santiago was last struck by a major earthquake in March 1985 which caused deaths and serious damage to buildings in the older districts of the city .
