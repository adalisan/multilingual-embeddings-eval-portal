gunmen killed a Sunni Moslem activist near a mosque in Jhang town of Pakistan &apos;s Punjab province on Tuesday , provoking a protest market strike , the official APP news agency said . 
Haji Mohammad Yousaf , a local leader of the militant Sunni Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan ( SSP ) group , was shot by two unidentified gunmen on a motorcycle when he was going to the mosque for morning prayers . 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility , but the shooting appeared to be the latest in a series of such attacks , for which the rival militant groups of the majority Sunni and the minority Shi &apos;ite sects blame each other . 
sectarian violence is rife in Punjab , where militant Sunni and Shi &apos;ite factions are engaged in a feud that officials say has killed more than 100 people this year , including religious scholars , lawyers and doctors . 
Sunni-Shi &apos;ite disputes over Islamic beliefs have often spilled into violence in Pakistan , which cost at least 170 lives last year . 
Shi &apos;ites form about 15 percent of Pakistan &apos;s mainly Sunni population of more than 135 million but are the majority in neighbouring Iran .
