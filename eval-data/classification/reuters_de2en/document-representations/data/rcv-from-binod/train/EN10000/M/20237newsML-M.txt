Ara fuel oil dropped about $ 2 a tonne as a couple of sellers sought to shift product , while light gasoline buying kept prices steady . 
Eurograde gasoline traded at $ 203 fob Ara as one major sought to cover a small requirement , traders said . 
however , weakening futures led swaps levels down over $ 1 a tonne to $ 200.50 / $ 201.50 fob Ara . 
weakening IPE gas oil futures had little effect on heating oil buying which remained weak . 
&quot; I think the last buyer has gone into his mousehole , &quot; one trader said . 
balance of August discussions faded , but first half September deliveries were only thinly discussed , material offered at Sept IPE + $ 1.00 / + $ 1.25 fob Ara . 
some players said the two sellers were eager to see lower numbers . 
first half September deliveries were bid at $ 97 , but no offers were seen , traders said .
