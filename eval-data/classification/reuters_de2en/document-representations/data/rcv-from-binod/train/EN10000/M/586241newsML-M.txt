sporadic election violence and fears of a meltdown in Thailand jolted Indonesian financial markets on Thursday , economists and dealers said . 
the rupiah fell but was stable to close locally at 2,442.50 against the dollar after opening at 2,433.50 . 
the stock market also suffered , with the composite index falling more than two percent to an intra-day low of 655.74 points at midsession before recovering slightly to close at 656.99 . 
overall the market lost 13.30 points . 
&quot; Part of the nervousness is related to what happens in the baht . 
you can see a similar impact on the ( Malaysian ) ringgit and the ( Philippine ) peso , &quot; an economist with a U.S. bank told Reuters . 
a property crisis in Thailand -- which is facing its slowest economic growth in 10 years -- has led to the scrutiny of potential weaknesses in financial markets in the region . 
the baht has also come under pressure , forcing the Thai central bank to defend the currency . 
Edwin PNG , chief treasurer at the Bank of America , said offshore investors were getting nervous because the campaign for the May 29 general elections was becoming increasingly violent . 
&quot; There is a spill-over from the Thai baht and they are getting nervous about the election campaign , &quot; PNG said . 
police said there was minor violence in Jakarta on Wednesday as the Moslem-oriented United Development Party ( PPP ) campaigned in the city and in other parts of the main Java island . 
clashes between PPP supporters and police also erupted in Central Java province but there were no casualties and no arrests , they said . 
the rupiah tumbled to a low 2,445 in London overnight on false rumours of riots and arson at a police station in Jakarta , but recovered later to 2,435 after police denied there was any major violence . 
on Thursday , witnesses said a group of ruling Golkar party supporters clashed with construction site workers in Jakarta after an argument . 
several people were injured when stones were thrown , but the fighting soon died down . 
another 75 seats in the house are allocated to the military , which does not vote . 
brokers said the stock market fall was more related to Thailand although the campaign had definitely added to worries . 
if you just see around Asia most markets are pretty much down , &quot; said Stephen Doe , research head of PT Asia Equity Jasereh . 
Doe said there were concerns among international investors of oversupply in the Jakarta property market . 
&quot; People have concerns about Jakarta . 
you only have to look out of the window and see a lot of office space being built and just say that there might be one or two problems here , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But we don &apos;t think there is a problem . 
but that is obviously what the international investors are worried about right now , &quot; he added . 
brokers said some investors were looking for bargains . 
&quot; Any time the market has bad days like this it &apos;s right to be picking up stocks you like , &quot; Doe said .
