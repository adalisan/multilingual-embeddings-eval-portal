African leaders repeated on Wednesday a call for an immediate ceasefire in Zaire to pave way for negotiations to end war in Africa &apos;s third largest country . 
the United States , which on Tuesday joined France in a joint ceasefire call , sent Assistant Secretary for African Affairs George moose , to join the leaders at the one-day Nairobi summit . 
but their statement contained very little different from two previous Nairobi summits in November and December . 
the rebels , who were not invited , said the meeting would solve nothing . 
but for the first time a Zairean government representative , Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo , joined the talks -- a day after a disputed vote in the Zairean transitional parliament to oust him . 
Presidents Daniel arap Moi of Kenya , Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe , Pascal Lissouba of Congo , South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and a representative from Cameroon also urged warring sides to allow in aid for the conflict &apos;s victims . 
&quot; The summit urged the parties to the conflict to immediately cease hostilities , and create the necessary environment to facilitate a negotiated settlement , &quot; said a statement at the close of the talks . 
the leaders were joined by Kengo , Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim and U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun . 
Kengo also signed the statement . 
Zairean rebels led by Laurent Kabila declared a ceasefire around the captured third largest city of Kisangani from Tuesday but Kabila has vowed to continue the war on all other fronts until he has negotiations with ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko . 
he says he will only negotiate over how Mobutu steps down . 
the Zairean government has already agreed to a five-point U.N. plan of which the first point is an immediate ceasefire . 
&quot; The summit urged all parties to do their utmost to facilitate access for humanitarian assistance and invited all United Nations agencies and other humanitarian organisations to provide this assistance , &quot; added the statement in Nairobi . 
opening the meeting , Moi warned that if the crisis in Zaire went out of control it would have widespread repercussions . 
Kengo declined to speak to reporters but officials said he he was still prime minister despite Tuesday &apos;s vote . 
the Zairean radical opposition in Kinshasa led by Etienne Tshisekedi sponsored Tuesday &apos;s parliamentary motion of censure against Kengo , which also called for a ceasefire and talks with Kabila . 
the opposition said on Wednesday Tshisekedi would begin contacts on forming a government to negotiate with the rebels . 
Zaire &apos;s armed forces chief of staff told the government on Wednesday to let the army take charge of weapons purchases and distribution , suggesting a deepening rift over the conduct of the war . 
at the same time , General Mahele Lieko Bokoungo played down rumours of an army coup saying that the state was not dead and there was no provision in the constitution for the army taking power in the event of an institutional void . 
Mahele went on to urge his notoriously ill-disciplined soldiers to refrain from looting . 
a Zairean presidential spokesman said Mobutu , undergoing treatment in Monaco for cancer of the prostate , would leave hosptial on Thursday and return home . 
airport officials in Nice in the south of France said Mobutu &apos;s plane was standing by to take him back to Zaire . 
France expressed worry on Wednesday over events in Zaire and said it was taking measures to protect its citizens . 
Germany told all its nationals to leave in the face of rebel advances . 
&quot; The current uncertainties have led us to take the necessary measures concerning the security of our citizens , &quot; French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt told a briefing . 
&quot; We are in close communication with our European and American partners , &quot; he added . 
he gave no further details .
