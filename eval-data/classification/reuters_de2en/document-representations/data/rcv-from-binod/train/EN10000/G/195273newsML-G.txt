the New aspiration Party ( NAP ) of Defence Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh edged past the Democrat Party which had earlier led in unofficial television and radio projections of the Thai elections on Sunday . 
official Radio Thailand and the Channel 7 television station put the NAP slightly ahead of the Democrat Party of former premier Chuan Leekpai based on vote counts about 4-1 / 2 hours after polls closed . 
three television stations had given the Democrat Party the edge over the NAP in initial projections about 90 minutes after the polls closed . 
radio Thailand projected the NAP would win 127 seats in the 393-seat parliament against 124 for the the Democrats . 
channel 7 television gave the NAP 125 and the Democrats 124 seats but Channel 9 television said the NAP was set to win 125 seats to the Democrats 126 . 
the NAP and the Democrats were seen running neck and neck even before polling closed for the Thai election , said by analysts to be the most violent and dirty in two decades . 
the election watchdog Pollwatch said seven people had been killed in election-related violence since the campaign began and up to 30 billion baht ( $ 1.2 billion ) had been spent by politicians on campaigns and vote-buying . 
the leaders of the two front-running parties , one of which is expected by analysts to be the core of a new coalition government , were unavailable for immediate comment . 
the NAP &apos;s stronghold is in Thailand &apos;s northeast , which is the country &apos;s poorest region , and the Democrats control most of the south . 
the Democrats were projected by most television and radio stations to have made a strong comeback in the capital of Bangkok winning 28 of the 37 seats at stake . 
after the July 2 , 1995 election , they had seven seats in the capital . 
regardless of the outcome , it is apparent neither the NAP nor the Democrats will win an outright majority of seats in parliament and must seek alliances to form a coalition . 
the Chart Pattana Party , which is running third in the polls and the incumbent Chart Thai Party of outgoing premier Banharn Silpa-archa , hold the key to the formation of a new administration , analysts said . 
the Palang Dharma Party ( PDP ) of telecommunications tycoon and former deputy prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was projected to have suffered a near total defeat in its Bangkok stronghold , losing 21 of the 23 seats it previously held . 
Thaksin promptly announced his resignation as head of the PDP on Sunday .
