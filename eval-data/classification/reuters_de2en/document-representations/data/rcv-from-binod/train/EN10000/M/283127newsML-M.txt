share prices at Bombay bourses recorded huge gains on Wednesday in a session that saw hectic volatility sparked by improved market sentiment , traders said . 
&quot; It &apos;s mainly a speculative bull run helped by a little bit of short-covering , &quot; said chief dealer Sanjeev Sanghvi at foreign brokerage James Capel B &amp; K. 
the Bombay Stock Exchange &apos;s ( BSE ) top index leapt 184.84 points to 3,270.04 , an intra-day high over its previous close . 
government officials on Tuesday said the government would announce a series of policy measures this month to boost industrial growth and sagging markets . 
&quot; The government is likely to announce the decisions early January , &quot; H.K. 
Dua , information advisor to the prime minister , told reporters at the end of a five-hour meeting between industrialists and the Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda . 
market participants said the good news came at a time of depressed sentiment and widespread concern about the slowdown in the economy . 
&quot; Basically , the government has said it will take a broader look at the economy . 
this has given optimism for operators to pick up stocks , &quot; said institutional dealer , Ashish Wakankar at broking firm Sundar Iyer . 
some dealers said second tier stocks also recorded sharp gains indicating strength in the rally . 
&quot; There is a flare-up in across-the board counters , &quot; Sundar Iyer &apos;s Wakankar said .
