President Mohammad Khatami on Tuesday submitted his cabinet choices to the Iranian parliament in his first key test in office . 
in a letter to the Majlis or parliament , the moderate Shi &apos;ite Moslem clergyman named ambassador to the United Nations Kamal Kharrazi to take over from Ali Akbar Velayati as foreign affairs minister . 
Hossein Namazi was chosen for the economy and finance portfolio , Bijan Namdar Zanganeh switched to the oil ministry from energy , Qorbanali Dorri Najafabadi was named to head intelligence , and navy chief Rear-Admiral Ali Shamkhani to defence . 
the list included no women , despite speculation after Khatami &apos;s landslide election victory in May that he would give at least one ministry to a woman -- a first for Iran . 
parliamentary Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said the 270-member assembly would start debating Khatami &apos;s nominations next Tuesday and give their verdict in a vote of confidence the following day . 
Khatami &apos;s ability to put in place a cabinet of his own choosing is seen as vital to the reforming scope and tone of his four-year administration . 
diplomats and analysts saw his list of 22 ministers as one of compromise on the politically sensitive positions of intelligence , foreign affairs and defence but a clear signal on domestic portfolios where the 54-year-old cleric promised change . 
&quot; It points to Khatami pressing for discreet but important changes on the domestic scene , particularly in regard to social policy , while leaving alone foreign security matters in the hands of his more conservative opponents , &quot; said one diplomat . 
deputies will debate the proposed ministers &apos; merits in three five-hour sessions . 
&quot; As of next Tuesday morning the Majlis ( parliament ) will start discussing the cabinet , &quot; Nateq-Nouri told deputies . 
afterwards he told reporters parliament would give its verdict by August 20 . 
their vote of confidence would be based only on their &quot; programme , management and executive records &quot; , the speaker said . 
it would not be influenced by affiliations and factionalism in judging the proposed ministers &apos; qualifications . 
one diplomat said nominations for the three central posts of foreign affairs , intelligence and defence would be quickly accepted by parliament hardliners . 
&quot; Each of them stands for the status-quo , promising little change in the short term , &quot; the diplomat said . 
Kharrazi is seen by some diplomats as a loyal technocrat who would be unlikely to herald major changes in foreign policy , particularly in Iran &apos;s hostile relations with the United States or the European Union . 
Kharrazi was in charge of war propaganda during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War . 
if confirmed , he would step into the shoes of Velayati , a soft-spoken paediatrician who has been the voice of the Islamic republic in world capitals since December 1981 . 
analysts said the nomination of conservative cleric and parliamentary deputy Najafabadi at intelligence was an important concession by the moderate president to his hardline opponents in parliament . 
changes were expected from Khatami &apos;s nominees at domestic ministeries particularly with the potentially controversial choice of Ataollah Mohajerani as minister of culture and Islamic guidance . 
Mohajerani has faced increasingly biting criticism from conservatives , being labelled as a &quot; liberal &quot; after he advocated direct talks with arch-foe the United States in 1990 and pressed for more cultural freedoms . 
&quot; Khatami has sent a signal that he will honour his election mandate of bringing social justice and civil law , &quot; said a Western diplomat who expected the parliament to challenge Mohajerani &apos;s position . 
Abdollah Nouri , nominated for the interior ministry , held the same post between 1990-1994 . 
he is noted as a member of a leftist-cleric association that has moved to a more moderate and centrist position in recent years . 
&quot; He is a reformist who will work like a bulldozer . 
he will bring changes to most of the provincial governors and mayors and will have a crucial role in the next parliamentary elections , &quot; the diplomat said . 
three of the 22 ministers proposed retained portfolios they held under former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani . 
they are Issa Kalantari at agriculture , Hossein Kamali at labour and Social Affairs and Justice Minister Esmail Shoushtari . 
two ministers proposed in the new cabinet were also carried over from Rafsanjani &apos;s team but were given new portfolios -- new oil minister Zanganeh and Gholamreza Shafei , who switched to the industry portfolio from cooperatives .
