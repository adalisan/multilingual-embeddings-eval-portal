Philippine banks were sidelined in the secondary Treasury bills market on Friday as they took a cautious stance on their liquidity positions , traders said . 
&quot; There &apos;s the possibility of tightness because of the additional reserve requirements , &quot; a trader said . 
the central bank said on Wednesday it was raising the liquidity reserve to four percent from three percent in order to siphon money that would have gone to peso speculation . 
&quot; We &apos;ll probably wait and see until the peso stabilises , &quot; a second dealer said . 
traders said the market had more sellers because banks wanted to remain liquid . 
a Reuters poll of eight financial institutions gave offers of 13.40 / 15.50 percent for the three-month bills ; 13.875 / 15.34 percent for the six months ; and 14.25 / 15 percent for the one-year bills . 
the average interbank call loan rate was steady at 20.0625 percent , with 25 lenders and 18 borrowers . 
volume was lower at 14.91 billion pesos from 16.84 billion pesos .
