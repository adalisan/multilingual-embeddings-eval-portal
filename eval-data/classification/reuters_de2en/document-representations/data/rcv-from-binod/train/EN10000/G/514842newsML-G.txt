Belgium said on Wednesday it had recently issued a new six-month visa to Zaire &apos;s former prime minister Kengo Wa Dondo , who is said by Zaire to have fled to Europe , but it did not know his current whereabouts . 
&quot; He received a visa last week when he was still in charge of current affairs in Zaire . 
his previous visa had expired , &quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Jan Luykx said . 
he added that one requirement for giving Belgian visas to Zairean nationals was that the recipient should be playing a constructive role in the democratisation process in the central African country . 
Zaire Information Minister Kin-Kiey Mulumba said on Tuesday his country was issuing an international warrant for the arrest of Kengo after Zaire &apos;s new government team had found the national treasury empty . 
Kengo was voted out of office three weeks ago . 
Zairean state television , which said the government was also pursuing judicial proceedings against Kengo &apos;s economic team , reported that the former prime minister had left the country . 
sources close to Kengo have said he quit Zaire on Sunday for Switzerland . 
Kengo , a part Tutsi , had been accused of weakness in the face of a rebellion launched from eastern Zaire last October , initially by ethnic Tutsis . 
rebels now hold about half the country and are advancing on the capital Kinshasa .
