Montenegro has dealt Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic &apos;s hopes of retaining power a potentially fatal blow by demanding his removal from &quot; any office in Yugoslavia &apos;s political life . 
a strong attack on Milosevic by Montenegrin Prime Minister Mile Djukanovic warned the Serbian leader he would not get the Montenegrin votes he needs to switch from the Serbian to the Yugoslav presidency this year . 
Djukanovic told the independent Belgrade weekly Vreme it would by &quot; totally wrong &quot; for Milosevic to stay and added : 
&quot; Milosevic &apos;s political thought is outdated ; he lacks the ability to view things strategically and he is surrounded by the wrong people who keep him rather uninformed about the real scale of Serbia &apos;s and Yugoslavia &apos;s problems . 
Montenegro , with a population of 550,000 compared with Serbia &apos;s 10.5 million , is the junior partner in the Yugoslav federation . 
but it is strongly placed to sabotage Milosevic &apos;s hopes of surviving more than three months of political turmoil in Serbia caused by his attempt to revoke opposition victories in local elections . 
unable to run legally this year for a third term as Serbian president , Milosevic planned to have himself elected Yugoslav president by the federal parliament . 
Montenegrin votes would be essential both for his election and for constitutional changes to give the ceremonial federal office the wide-ranging executive powers Milosevic has wielded as Serbian president . 
Djukanovic &apos;s government has chafed increasingly under Serbian policies which have kept Yugoslavia internationally isolated and refused entry to world diplomatic and financial bodies despite the lifting of U.N. sanctions . 
it has threatened to try to reach separate agreements with the international community and if necessary to abandon the Yugoslav dinar and mint its own currency . 
the election dispute has added democratic reforms to the list of requirements the West is demanding from Belgrade in return for a gradual lifting of Yugoslavia &apos;s quarantine . 
the Zajedno ( Together ) coalition of opposition parties which waged a campaign of street protests to enforce its victories in 14 of Serbia &apos;s 18 biggest towns took control of the Belgrade city assembly on Friday . 
Zajedno &apos;s breakthrough ended a 50 year monopoly of power by Milosevic &apos;s Socialists ( SPS ) and ignited a battle between party hardliners and pragmatists on ways to keep the opposition at bay ahead of Serbian presidential and parliamentary elections due by the end of 1997 . 
SPS pragmatists , with Montenegro &apos;s support , favoured an early compromise with Zajedno to appease the West and improve Yugoslavia &apos;s chances of obtaining aid to rebuild its destroyed economy . 
the debilitating struggle , ending in defeat for the SPS , showed the rival wings of the party to be evenly balanced with a weakened Milosevic unable to impose his will on either side . 
political sources said Djukanovic &apos;s remarks about Milosevic &apos;s outdated political thought and &quot; the wrong people &quot; around him referred to the Serbian leader &apos;s marxist wife Mirjana Markovic . 
pragmatists dislike the hardline influence on Milosevic and his goverment of Markovic &apos;s United Yugoslav Left ( JUL ) which is hostile to the political and market reforms enacted by other east bloc countries which threw off communism in 1989-90 .
