English league division one side Leicester had to rely on two late converted tries before they overcame Irish provincial side Leinster 27-10 ( half-time 13-10 ) in a European Cup pool B game at Lansdowne Road on Wednesday . 
Leicester , who are currently fifth in their league , had to wait until the 67th minute when scrum-half Aadel Kardooni touched down to the left of the posts and fly-half Rob Liley converted before they finally made sure of the win . 
Liley converted a try by flanker John Wells in the 73rd minute to put something of a gloss on the final scoreline . 
Leinster , who were beaten 34-17 by Welsh side Llanelli on Saturday , having led 17-16 at half-time , started well and soon had the full support of the 1,000 spectators in attendance . 
their fly-half Alan McGowan was wide with two penalty kicks inside the opening 10 minutes while right-winger Paddy Gavin was tackled into touch five metres out in the 12th minute after a break from the back of a scrum by number eight Victor Costello . 
Leinster finally made their pressure tell in the 14th minute when French referee Joel Dume awarded them a penalty try , awarded against the Leicester forwards for not allowing the ball to come out from a ruck under the posts . 
McGowan converted . 
McGowan made it 10-0 to the home side in the 17th minute after Leicester were caught offside at a ruck . 
Liley kicked two penalties before Leicester took the lead for the first time in the 38th minute when prop-forward Graham Rowntree touched down near the posts after right-winger Steve Hackney had made a vital break through the home defence . 
the conversion by Liley had Leicester 13-10 up at the break . 
an incredible passage of play inside 10 minutes of the resumption saw McGowan , who was wide with six penalties and one drop-goal attempt in the game , hit both posts and the crossbar with three successive penalties . 
twice Leinster centre Kurt McQuilkin came close to turning the game in Leinster &apos;s favour but on each occasion he was stopped in his tracks by crunching Leicester tackles . 
the home side were made to pay dearly for these misses when Kardooni dived over for Leicester &apos;s second try of the game , a score which , when converted , gave the visitors an unassailable 10 point lead .
