Egyptian and Palestinian Presidents Hosni Mubarak and Yasser Arafat , in revolt against U.S. diplomacy , asked U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday to postpone a Middle East summit set for Tuesday in Washington . 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and King Hussein of Jordan left for Washington regardless , driving a clear wedge between those in favour of Clinton &apos;s plan and those against . 
Arafat and Mubarak met for more than two hours in the northwest Egyptian town of Burg al-Arab and Arab diplomats said they were still seeking assurances that a summit would result in firm guarantees of Israeli gestures towards the Palestinians . 
&quot; I received an invitation from His Excellency President Clinton and I sent him my reply , &quot; Arafat told reporters after arriving in Cairo from Burg al-Arab . 
asked what his reply was , he said : &quot; I can &apos;t say before he receives the reply ... The important thing is how to implement accurately what has been agreed upon ( with Israel ) . 
Palestinian officials in Cairo said Arafat would leave for Luxembourg from Cairo in mid-afternoon for a meeting in the evening to discuss Clinton &apos;s summit with European Union ministers . 
it was not clear if he would go on to Washington . 
earlier in the day Arafat asked Clinton to delay the summit to allow more time for preparations . 
&quot; Mubarak has joined Arafat in calling for a delay , &quot; a PLO official added later . 
&quot; Mubarak wants to see a clearly defined programme of action ( by Israel ) . 
and he doesn &apos;t want to get involved in an unsuccessful summit , &quot; said an Arab diplomat close to the Arafat-Mubarak talks . 
&quot; So far the Israelis are still being intransigent . 
contacts are continuing but the position is not clear , &quot; he added . 
but in Washington , the State Department said it expects Arafat to attend the summit talks on Tuesday and Wednesday . 
Mubarak has been cool about the summit idea since Clitnon announced it on Sunday , on suspicion that Clinton and Netanyahu will not give the Arabs credible guarantees that Israel will carry out old agreements , diplomats said . 
the Arab stand amounts to a revolt against Washington unprecedented since the United States brought Israel and its Arab neighbours together at the Madrid conference in 1991 . 
it also shows the depth of Arab disillusionment with the U.S. administration , which has declined to take a stand in public against the policies of Netanyahu &apos;s rightwing government , which came to power after elections in May . 
Palestinian officials said an all-night meeting between Palestinians , Israelis , U.S. and U.N. officials failed to solve problems over what the summit would discuss . 
Arafat and Mubarak want Israel to close a tunnel near Moslem holy sites in Arab East Jerusalem , which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war . 
Netanyahu says the controversial tunnel will stay open forever and this is not on the agenda . 
&quot; The idea was to agree on most everything here before going to Washington , but no conclusions were reached , &quot; said Marwan Kanafani , an Arafat aide . 
&quot; The Israelis refused to agree on any political issues . 
they wanted to discuss security issues . 
they are not serious , and Arafat has no desire to meet Netanyahu just for the sake of meeting him , &quot; added a PLO official who declined to be named . 
Clinton called for the summit to help end five days of clashes in which 55 Palestinians and 14 Israelis have died . 
the clashes broke out after Israel opened the tunnel near the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem , Islam &apos;s third holiest site . 
in an interview published on Monday , Mubarak said that unless Netanyahu carries out agreements signed by Israel and the Palestinian Authority , the violence could break out again . 
&quot; The situation can explode again , as long the agreements and treaties are not implemented , &quot; he told the party newspaper Mayo . 
&quot; The latest events in the Palestinian territories are the natural result of procrastination in carrying out the articles of the agreements and the severe pressure on the economy of the Palestinian people , &quot; he added . 
&quot; I have warned before and I warn again of a new uprising by the Palestinians if they are in despair or lose hope that they will obtain their rights , as enshrined in charters .
