Hungary &apos;s papers hailed the Madrid summit &apos;s invitation to the country to join NATO as an important step on the road from Soviet domination to Western integration . 
&quot; Yesterday Hungary took another step on the road leading from the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Treaty to the chance of accession to Western democracies , &quot; wrote the daily Nepszabadsag . 
&quot; The Madrid summit of the heads of state and government of the 16 NATO member states opened the gate of the Atlantic alliance to the one-time enemies , the current partners for peace . 
the 16 NATO countries &apos; leaders on Tuesday invited Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic and to start talks intended to lead them to membership in 1999 . 
the daily Magyar Hirlap wrote that until now Hungary had been thwarted in its attempts to take its &quot; natural place &quot; in the mainstream of European development . 
&quot; Hungary badly needs today to be finally accepted by the continent in which it has been for a thousand years . 
the Madrid summit made not only an invitation but a challenge - which Hungary should meet . 
the Magyar Hirlap considered the choice before ordinary Hungarians when a national referendum on whether to accept the NATO &apos;s invitation to join the alliance is held later this year . 
&quot; At this historic moment , for Central Europe , NATO accession seems similar to democracy : nothing better has so far been invented . 
&quot; Of course , we could speak of sacred neutrality and argue that after the break-up of the Warsaw Pact Hungary should not become engaged to another alliance . 
&quot; We should not ignore , however , that the broadly opened gate to NATO also opened the road towards the European Union , which might otherwise be delayed . 
opposition parties , all of which support NATO membership , joined the government in Parliament in a spontaneous round of applause when the news from Madrid came through on Tuesday . 
former foreign minister in Hungary &apos;s first post-communist government Geza Jeszenszky , of the Democratic Peoples &apos; Party , said Hungarians owed it to NATO that no nuclear war had broken out in Europe while Hungary was for 40 years a member of NATO &apos;s post-World War Two adversary , the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact . 
&quot; Given our history , it is very important that foreign powers not be able ( again ) to occupy our country and force a bad political and economic system on us , &quot; he said .
