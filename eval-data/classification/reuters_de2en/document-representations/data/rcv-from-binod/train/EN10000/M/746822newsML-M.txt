Greek stocks continued to trade 
narrowly and finished virtually unchanged on Tuesday as blue 
chips which had pushed the market 0.81 percent higher in early 
dealings turned back towards the end of the session . 
brokers said trading volume on the Athens bourse wound down 
due to the summer holiday doldrums that kept the market from 
embarking on a clear trend . 
&quot; The market operates well below capacity as investors have 
lost their appetite for trading as we have entered the vacation 
season , &quot; said Alexis Panagiotopoulos , broker at InterSec . 
&quot; turnover has dropped considerably and the benchmark index 
hovers around current levels as there is no clear imbalance 
between buyers and sellers , &quot; he added . 
but the lack of trading interest was a seasonal phenomenon 
which was expected to disappear in August , with blue chips 
leading the market higher again . 
&quot; Investors will be out on the prawl again for equities in 
the second half of August and momentum will start to build up 
again , &quot; Panagiotopoulos said . 
&quot; But banks and industrials will be 
the top picks at that time and lead the next leg of the rally .
