the writing may be on the wall for the two parties which have ruled Poland since 1993 and now face a strong right-wing challenge in parliamentary elections late this year . 
opinion polls show a new alliance of rightist parties grouped around the Solidarity trade union could snatch a bigger chunk of the vote than the dominant partner in the ruling coalition , the ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance ( SLD ) . 
whichever side wins , the new cabinet will be formed just months before the likely start of Poland &apos;s talks with the European Union on entry -- when its success in scrapping vestiges of the pre-1989 communist economic system will be crucial to its case . 
analysts are split on which group is better suited for this task . 
both parties , which have their roots in the communist era , include reform-minded liberals as well as populists and advocates of state interventionism . 
the uncertainty is all the greater because neither alliance is likely to win a clear majority and may have to find allies among smaller parties which could have wield strong influence . 
&quot; The ex-communists may lose the elections , but only in the sense that they will not end up as the strongest caucus in parliament , &quot; said Halina Franczak , an analyst for the private Demoskop polling institute . 
other parties , including the SLD &apos;s current uneasy partner the Polish Peasant Party ( PSL ) , the centrist Union for Freedom and the rightist Movement for the Reconstruction of Poland ( ROP ) are trailing far behind . 
the Solidarity bloc , with its trade union nucleus , may lack the resolve for decisions which could cost jobs in inefficient industries and cuts in social programmes , analysts say . 
the SLD , although it won the 1993 elections with promises to ease pains linked with a shift to capitalism , has partly continued changes begun after 1989 and stressed financial discipline , disappointing some of its own leftist electorate . 
this time round , economic recovery is its campaign theme . 
but the opposition and some independent analysts accuse the three SLD-Peasant cabinets since 1993 of complacently benefiting from their predecessors &apos; reforms of the early 1990s , while neglecting politically risky moves such as an urgently needed overhaul of the collapsing social security system . 
the opposition alleges the ex-communists and peasants have instead harmed reform by planting supporters , competent or not , in hosts of official posts , banks and other state firms . 
some analysts say the status quo , with economic growth of about six percent last year , might seem more tempting to voters than uncertainty about the Solidarity bloc &apos;s economic policies . 
&quot; From the point of view of reforms , I would be a bit afraid of a Solidarity government . 
their views on the economy are far from clear , &quot; said Bohdan Wyznikiewicz of the Gdansk-based Market Economy Research Institute ( IBnGR ) . 
the Solidarity bloc , uniting more than 30 fractious little parties on a platform of Catholic , family and patriotic values , has said it will unveil its detailed programme , in the form of ready-drafted laws , just six weeks before the elections . 
meanwhile its leading politicians are sending conflicting signals on the pace of privatisation , rules on foreign investment and on trade liberalisation . 
they also differ on public sector spending levels and on how quickly Poland should enter the European Union , although none of them question the ultimate need to join . 
but a leader of one party in the Solidarity bloc caused uproar in January by saying Poland should oppose the membership of Germany , Warsaw &apos;s chief ally on its way to the EU , on the U.N. Security Council -- although this view was quickly disowned by fellow leaders of the grouping . 
Wyznikiewicz said that once in power , the Solidarity alliance might abandon its current , often populist rhetoric and pursue liberal policies just as its ex-communist foes had done four years ago . 
&quot; Working in the government has a sobering effect , you see facts and figures and you see that you do not have much room to manoeuvre , &quot; he said . 
the Solidarity alliance says it would speed up Poland &apos;s economic change by removing the left &apos;s political placemen and patronage from the economy and administration . 
&quot; Our victory would mean a more market economy , stripped of leftovers of the old system and informal ( political ) links , &quot; Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski told Reuters . 
solidarity also promises to go ahead with its own projects for long-delayed reforms of the pension and health care systems , which the ruling left has stalled . 
the ex-communists say Solidarity will neglect the economy because it is obsessed with undoing wrongs and settling scores from the communist past or with issues such as reimposing a strict anti-abortion law . 
&quot; Much less attention will be paid to quiet development of the economy if the political scene becomes dominated by groups for which historic divisions and decommunisation are the main issues , &quot; ex-communist leader Jozef Oleksy said .
