Rwanda &apos;s envoy to France said on Thursday his country saw little use for an international conference suggested by French President Jacques Chirac to deal with the deteriorating situation on the Zaire-Rwanda border . 
Modeste Rutabayiru , head of Rwanda &apos;s diplomatic mission to France , told a news conference his country was also cool towards any idea of an international peace force in the region . 
&quot; The Rwandan government does not see , for the moment , the use of a conference but remains open to the possibility if its agenda is set and its objectives defined , &quot; he said . 
on Wednesday Chirac urged heads of states in east and central Africa to call a conference quickly under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organisation for African Unity . 
Rutabayiru also dismissed suggestions for a peacekeeping force . 
&quot; We do not think that deploying an armed force in the region is the best way to resolve the crisis in Zaire , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The solution is to help Zaire obtain a ceasefire between its army and those fighting against it . 
the diplomat said there was no question of Rwanda signing a truce with Zaire since , he said , the conflict solely involved Zaire and Zairean people of Rwandan origin . 
he said Rwanda had no ambitions towards Zairean territory and an incursion by Rwandan troops into Zaire this week was aimed solely at silencing artillery firing into Rwanda . 
&quot; We reserve the right to reply ( if attacked ) but we are not a party to this conflict , &quot; Rutabayiru said .
