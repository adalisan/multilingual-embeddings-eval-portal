Arab reaction to the U.S. attacks on Iraq has been dominated by deep cynicism about Washington &apos;s motives , mixed with concern that the turmoil in Iraqi Kurdistan might upset the regional status quo . 
only Kuwait , the victim of an Iraqi invasion in 1990 , has come out in full support for the attacks , seen elsewhere in the Arab world as another sign of the arrogant abuse of military power abroad for U.S. electoral purposes . 
but diplomats in Cairo say Arab reservations about the U.S. military action do not imply sympathy for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein or presage a serious blow to U.S. relations with its Arab friends and allies . 
Arab governments , aware that domestic public opinion is sensitive to any Western intervention in fellow Arab states , would rather the affair died a quiet death and the United States turned its attention back to Middle East peace . 
&quot; They just want it go away . 
most Arab states have been happy to have Saddam Hussein out of the picture all these years and the last thing they want is a decisive victory by any of the protagonists , especially Iran , &quot; one diplomat said . 
in commentaries on the attacks , Arab pundits have revived most of the old Arab grievances against Washington , such as its unilateral interpretations of international law and apparent contempt for the views of friendly Arab governments . 
Arabs have traditionally been indifferent to Kurdish aspirations , anyway , even when the Kurds were united against Saddam . 
and Arab rulers have largely succeeded in persuading their subjects that every government , even the Iraqi , has the right and duty to defend its sovereignty at all costs . 
they see the United States tightening the noose around three Arab states -- Iraq , Libya and Sudan -- and wonder which state might be next in line for U.N. sanctions . 
&quot; Since it reached the apex of the pyramid in the new world order , the United States has been adopting the behaviour of the cowboy and the quarrelsome bully in every international crisis that turns up , not the behaviour of a responsible superpower striving for justice and peace , &quot; Egyptian commentator Nabil Omar wrote in the government newspaper al-Ahram . 
&quot; Iraq has not broken any international law , it hasn &apos;t invaded any country , as it did with Kuwait . 
it was practising its legitimate sovereignty over its territory , &quot; he added . 
&quot; Americans are obsessed with violence , with Superman and with Rambo . 
Syria , potentially one of the most fragile states in the region because of its religious and ethnic diversity , has put Iraqi territorial integrity at the centre of its Iraq policy . 
Syria also is on the U.S. list of countries alleged to support international &quot; terrorism &quot; and is the Arab state most vulnerable to being the next victim of U.S. wrath . 
hence the strong reaction to the U.S. attacks from the Syrian government , despite the long feud and personal enmity between Saddam Hussein and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad . 
&quot; The bombing of targets in Iraq ... constitutes a threat to the unity of Iraq and its regional safety , &quot; a Syrian foreign ministry spokesman said on Tuesday . 
&quot; It violates the U.N. charter and international laws which protect the unity and sovereignty of countries and reject interference in internal affairs . 
Arabs also see non-Arabs such as Iran and Turkey as the most likely beneficiaries from a breakdown in the delicate status quo which has prevailed in northern Iraq since the Kurds set up a de facto autonomous state with Western support in 1991 . 
&quot; It might end ... in Iran managing to annex part of northern Iraq and and fulfilling its old dream of creating a corridor linking it with Syria and opening a path to the Mediterranean , &quot; said Egyptian commentator Mursi Atallah . 
Washington may be taking the brunt of the criticism , with commentators asking why it did not block Turkish incursions into Iraq or Israeli attacks on Lebanon , but the U.S. assault has not made Saddam Hussein a hero . 
&quot; This Iraqi regime constitutes a major obstacle to building pan-Arab solidarity or regional stability . 
wittingly or unwittingly , it is dancing to the tune of those who have covetous ambitions against this nation , &quot; added Atallah . 
&quot; We urge Iraq to return to wisdom and undermine any excuses that would help the American aggression , &quot; said a spokesman for the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine .
