Wellington , Aug 27 - It &apos;s crunch time for politicians , not least for the enfant terrible of the current Parliament , Winston Peters . 
just three months ago New Zealand First &apos;s leader was riding high in political opinion polls , and looked set to play a key role in forming a coalition government after the October 12 election . 
now , with three polls confirming that NZ First is slipping in public esteem , Peters is off like a whirling dervish around the country , speaking to his favourite Grey Power audiences . 
he is trying to beat off the challenge of the Alliance which has stormed back in the polls , rising five points in as many months to 16 percent , while NZ First fell from 30 percent to 21 percent . 
some commentators see the Alliance and NZ First drawing support from the same pool of voters , disenchanted in both Labour and National . 
the Alliance appeared to steal a march on NZ First by its vigorous campaign against the sale of Forestcorp . 
it has taken such a strong line on issues , not just on the sale of Forestry Corporation , but on health and education , that both NZ First and Labour have appeared wishy-washy by comparison . 
NZ First has even appeared to retreat from the more extreme rhetoric it espoused earlier in the year , and on some issues -- market rentals for state houses -- it has sought to distinguish itself from parties of the Left by supporting the current policy , leading some critics to speculate that it is positioning itself to link up with National in a coalition of the Right . 
perhaps realising that this kind of pragmatism was getting him nowhere , Winston Peters has , in his latest blasts to Grey Power , come out with guns blazing against National &apos;s &quot; secret &quot; post-election agenda , which is to privatise any remaining public assets that attract private sector interest . 
those assets , he says , include Works Corp , Government Property Service , Electricity Corp , Transpower , NZ Post and ACC - though how anyone could regard ACC as an &quot; asset &quot; ( it is carrying unfunded liabilities put at around $ 5 billion ) remains a mystery . 
according to Peters , National has swallowed the great lie that the private sector knows how to run a business better than the public sector.Given that National was founded to foster private enterprise against state socialism , Peters seems to have moved a long way philosophically from the days he himself claimed a place on National &apos;s front-bench . 
he also defends the export and marketing monopolies of the Dairy Board and the Apple and pear Board . 
they stand as &quot; dramatic evidence &quot; , he says , that competition does not always work in the public interest , adding that the Business roundtable and Treasury hate these successful businesses for a simple reason ... they work ! 
Peters believes National &apos;s secret agenda also extends to privatising the health system . 
&quot; It is clear that the funder / provider split in health funding and the legislative priority for Crown Health Enterprises are clear indicators that National simply awaits another three years to complete this Far Right madness . 
and Labour , in Peters &apos; book , is a &quot; willing partner in this obscene political complicity ... it was Labour , not National , which started the privatisation agenda . 
and on the Forestry Corp sale , Labour resembled nothing so much as a possum caught in the headlights of an approaching truck &quot; . 
labour , he says , &quot; are the ultimate political quislings &quot; . 
its duplicity can be seen in its housing policy , with promises to introduce income-related rents in the public sector , which Peters says ignores the fact that the majority of low-income tenants are in the private sector . 
Peters claims that an independent valuation puts the cost of Labour &apos;s housing policy at double its stated $ 100 million . 
the reality is that Labour is up to its old tricks , again , promising policies that cannot be delivered . 
whether Peters &apos; return to his early-season rhetoric will revive NZ First &apos;s fortunes remains to be seen . 
maybe he will have to vamp up what he claims to be NZ First &apos;s &quot; unique &quot; quality as the only party that &quot; intends to share power with the NZ people &quot; .
