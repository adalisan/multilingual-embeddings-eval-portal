Australian bonds reclaimed some of the spread widening against U.S. and Canadian bonds that has occurred this week , and the curve flattened to its lowest level since the beginning of the month . 
despite the narrowing , which was mainly at the short end , spreads still remain above their levels of last week . 
the spread to U.S. 10-years closed last Friday at 100 points , while to Canadian 10-years , the margin was 66 points . 
the outperformance of short dated bonds on the day saw the cash and futures curves end at their steepest levels since October 1 . 
while bonds closed fairly flat to New Zealand on the day , they have still outperformed them over the week . 
after some overnight selling which weakened it at the open , the NZ market improved through the day although it still finished in negative territory . 
opinion polls ahead of NZ &apos;s election this weekend showing an increasing chance of the Labour party and its potential coalition partners winning power have dented the confidence seen in the market in recent weeks , traders said .
