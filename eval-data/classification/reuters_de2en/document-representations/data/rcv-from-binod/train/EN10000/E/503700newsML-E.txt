sales at retail stores barely edged up in March after two booming sales months at the start of the year , the Commerce Department said on Friday . 
total retail sales rose last month by 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 215.6 billion after revised increases of 1.5 percent in February and 1.7 percent in January . 
an unexpected drop in sales by auto dealers -- after their strongest sales gain in a year during February -- held down overall sales in March . 
the March retail sales gain was weaker than anticipated by Wall Street economists , who had forecast a more robust 0.6 percent pickup in business . 
it may raise questions about the durability of consumer demand in the second quarter , though it followed two exceptionally strong sales months . 
&quot; Retail sales saw a strong upward revision to February &apos;s number , from 0.8 to 1.5 percent . 
so overall , it is a bit stronger than expected , &quot; said David Sloan , an economist at I.D.E.A. 
Inc . 
&quot; I think it confirms that consumer spending was strong in the first quarter , &quot; he added . 
&quot; There is some possiblility that spending will slow , but this data confirms a strong first quarter . 
investors reacted to the strong January and February revisions by pushing the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond down 20 / 32 of a point , or $ 6.25 on a $ 1,000 bond . 
its yield , which moves in the opposite direction , rose to 7.16 percent from 7.11 percent Thursday . 
the Federal Reserve cited strong demand as the primary reason for its decision on March 25 to boost short-term interest rates . 
most analysts predicted further rate rises later in the year until the central bank feels that demand has waned enough to keep inflation in check . 
the central bank raised the federal funds target by a quarter percentage point to 5.5 percent , which tamps down demand by raising costs for everything from credit-card borrowing to new-car loans . 
during March , auto-dealer sales fell 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 53.6 billion . 
that followed a 3.3 percent jump in February sales that was the strongest monthly gain since a 3.6 percent surge in February 1996 . 
new cars account for about one-quarter of total retail sales , so swings in demand strongly affect the overall monthly figures . 
excluding cars , retail sales rose 0.5 percent last month after a 0.9 percent increase in February . 
previously , Commerce said total January retail sales had risen by 1.5 percent and February sales were up 0.8 percent . 
but the government revised its estimate of the February sales rise to 1.5 percent -- nearly double its original estimate -- and boosted the January increase to 1.7 percent . 
that made the January sales gain the strongest in nearly a year since a matching 1.7 percent increase in February 1996 . 
sales by general merchandise stores rose modestly by 0.3 percent to $ 27.5 billion in March after a 1.3 percent jump in February . 
at apparel stores , sales of clothing increased 0.6 percent after gaining 0.3 percent in February . 
sales of all types of durable goods , from new cars to building hardware , rose a scant 0.1 percent in March to $ 89.3 billion after a 3.1 percent increase in February . 
sales of non-durables like food and clothing gained 0.3 percent last month to $ 126.3 billion after a 0.4 percent March rise . 
sales of building materials increased 1.6 percent to $ 11.9 billion in March after a 2.2 percent jump in February . 
gasoline service station sales were down 0.8 percent in March to $ 13.4 billion following a 1.1 percent fall in February . 
cheaper prices for imported oil after a winter surge have been reflected in lower gasoline prices , which is reflected in the sales total .
