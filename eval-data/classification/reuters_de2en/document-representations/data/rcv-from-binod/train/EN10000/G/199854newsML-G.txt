King Hussein of Jordan on Tuesday welcomed an announcement by U.S. President Bill Clinton naming his country a major non-NATO ally of the United States . 
&quot; We are proud of this and we appreciate this initiative by the U.S. president and his administration , &quot; the king said in a letter to his army and security chiefs carried by the official Petra news agency . 
Clinton last week named Jordan a major non-NATO ally , adding the country to a small group of states granted priority to receive excess U.S. materiel and other military privileges . 
a U.S. state department official said at the time he did not believe the designation carried with it any expanded U.S. commitment to come to Jordan &apos;s defence in a time of crisis . 
but the king said Jordan &quot; realised that allies owe it to each other to work together on the basis of mutual respect and joint cooperation ... and in confronting any event or new emergency . 
the king said former Warsaw Pact countries were scrambling to join NATO &quot; to enjoy what has been afforded to us now &quot; , and condemned those he said were questioning Jordan &apos;s need to safeguard its military strength . 
&quot; pity on those who want Jordan small and weak eternally , &quot; he said . 
U.S. relations with Jordan plummeted during the 1991 Gulf War when the kingdom was seen as sympathetic to Iraq . 
but ties improved dramatically after Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in October 1994 . 
since then Washington has taken several steps to strengthen ties with Jordan , including the transfer of F-16 warplanes to Jordan &apos;s armed forces . 
other countries which have been granted the special status are Australia , Egypt , Israel , Japan and the Republic of Korea .
