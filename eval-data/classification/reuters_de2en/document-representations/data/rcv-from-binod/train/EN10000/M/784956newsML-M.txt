Tokyo naphtha prices slipped in afternoon trade on Thursday , weighed down by bearish regional fundamentals as well as weaker overnight crude oil markets , traders said . 
&quot; It &apos;s mostly sluggish demand in the region ( that has pulled down naphtha levels ) , but overseas crude didn &apos;t help , either , &quot; one naphtha trader said . 
Naphtha requirements from petrochemical manufacturers remained slow , depressed by sliding export prices for petrochemical products derived from naphtha , traders said . 
most polyethylene and polypropylene grades have lost by $ 50 to $ 100 per tonne over the past month on a C &amp; F ( cost and freight ) Hong Kong basis , traders said . 
the price slides were attributed to the currency crisis in Southeast Asia , which has reduced regional petrochemical traders &apos; buying power , as well as to ample spot supplies . 
Open-spec naphtha for second-half October was assessed at $ 210.00 / $ 211.00 per tonne , compared with late Wednesday &apos;s $ 212.00 / $ 212.50 .
