Peru could revise upward its five percent estimate for economic growth this year following a 13.7 percent year-on-year jump in April , compared to a 1.8 percent rise in the same month last year , analysts said Tuesday . 
the economy &quot; can easily grow between 5.5 percent or six percent this year , &quot; Santander Investment analyst , Andrew Marshall , told Reuters following Tuesday &apos;s announcement of the highest monthly economic growth for more than two years . 
the April jump brought the gross domestic product ( GDP ) rise for the first four months of 1997 to 7.3 percent year-on- year , compared with 0.7 percent growth year-on-year in the 1996 January to April period . 
the April figure was welcome news for a government forced last year to revise constantly downward its GDP estimates as a policy-driven economic slowdown lasted longer than planned . 
the government &apos;s daily El Peruano published the GDP figure two days earlier than expected and blazed the figure across its front page under the banner headline : &quot; Peruvian Economy upturn . 
local analysts agreed the economy now looked stronger than the five percent yearly rise the government had agreed with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) as its 1997 goal . 
&quot; We are already revising our projections . 
everything makes us suppose the Peruvian economy will grow this year above five percent , &quot; Elmer Cuba , analyst at local consulting firm Macroconsult , said . 
while the IMF-government program of economic targets for 1996 to 1998 had predicted sustained annual growth averaging six percent , the economy cooled off dramatically last year to record a 2.8 percent GDP rise . 
such an apparently insignificant figure was a surprise to most Peruvians , who had become used to having Latin America &apos;s fastest growing economy after GDP rose 7.0 percent in 1995 and 12.9 percent the year before . 
with President Alberto Fujimori looking forward to a possible third election bid , higher government spending on infrastructure was likely to keep the country on course for higher-than-expected growth , the analysts said . 
&quot; I think Peru has returned to sustained growth , &quot; Marshall said , adding he expected the economy &apos;s monthly year-on-year rises in May and June to be between six and seven percent . 
players on the Lima Stock Exchange received word of the high April figure Monday and bought equities so heavily the Bolsa recorded its highest overall rise of the year . 
investors may have taken profits Tuesday on that four percent gain , but the latest GDP figure would further boost an exchange that has seen share prices already gain fifty percent this year , brokers said . 
&quot; With expectations for the production figure now confirmed , the buy orders could fall off and the market could correct for a few days before it flattens out , &quot; Miguel Bondy of local brokerage Andina Capital Market said .
