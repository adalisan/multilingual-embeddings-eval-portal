the Clinton administration on Tuesday joined members of Congress in launching a bipartisan initiative to promote trade and economic development in sub-Saharan Africa . 
in an unusual alliance across party lines , Republican House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich agreed with President Bill Clinton that the United States needed a new economic policy for an area long neglected by the superpowers . 
Gingrich , in testimony at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing , said the initiative offered a chance for the United States to form a partnership with African nations . 
&quot; We have an opportunity to form a genuine partnership , &quot; he said , adding that the United States should tell Africans , &quot; We want to work with you on the right economic policies . 
he said those policies should include low taxes and high investment and he endorsed bipartisan legislation directing the president to develop plans for a U.S.-sub-Saharan Africa free trade area . 
the administration &apos;s &quot; Partnership for Promoting Economic Growth and Opportunity in Africa &quot; emphasised support for countries that make efforts to open their markets and become more involved in global trade . 
&quot; In an increasingly competitive global economy , the United States cannot afford to neglect a largely untapped market of some 600-million-plus people , and the world cannot afford to see a vast region marginalized , &quot; U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told the committee . 
&quot; The lowering of tariffs and other trade barriers will help African nations to grow , &quot; she said . 
&quot; They will also help Americans by opening these markets to our goods and services . 
she said Africa &apos;s share of trade in the last 40 years had fallen from 3.1 percent to a scant 1.2 percent . 
a recent World Bank study blamed restrictive trade barriers that incorporate a substantial anti-export bias , she said . 
the initiative calls for expanding the General System of Preferences programme , which allows products from poor countries into the United States duty free , to include more products from African countries undertaking bold reforms , Barshefsky said . 
she also called on Congress to act quickly to re-authorise the GSP programme , which expires at the end of May . 
she said the Overseas Private Investment Corporation ( OPIC ) was working with private investors on a proposed $ 150 million fund for equity investment in a number of sectors . 
she said OPIC was working to develop separate funds for infrastructure projects . 
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the United States would support efforts to reduce the debt burden of African countries that liberalise trade and investment . 
he said the United States would support an approach that leads to elimination of concessional bilateral debt for the poorest countries that undertake bold reforms . 
Washington would urge the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to provide maximum relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) debt initiative for eligible countries , Summer said . 
&quot; The budgets of many African countries are both heavily burdened by debt service and highly dependent on revenues from trade taxes , &quot; he said . 
&quot; typically 40 to 50 percent of total budget revenues come from trade taxes . 
we want to see to it that aggressively liberalising countries have enough breathing space to carry through with a comprehensive programme of trade liberalisation and tax reforms . 
other witnesses testifying in favour of the legislation included Jack Kemp , the 1996 Republican vice presidential nominee , and ambassadors from several African nations including South Africa , Kenya and Ethiopa .
