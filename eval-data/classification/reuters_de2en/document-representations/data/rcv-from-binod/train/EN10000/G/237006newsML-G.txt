the United States opposes moves by China to disband Hong Kong &apos;s elected legislature next year and is not satisfied at the progress of human rights talks with Beijing , the top U.S. diplomat on Asia said on Thursday . 
&quot; We believe that the disbanding of the elected legislature is both unnecessary and unwise , &quot; U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord told reporters at the end of a two-day visit to Hong Kong . 
&quot; The United States has a very strong interest in seeing a smooth and successful transition here and will be working to support that process up to and through and beyond July 1 , 1997 . 
China opposes democratic reforms brought in by British colonial Governor Chris Patten without its approval , and has vowed to replace the elected legislature with a provisional body when it takes over the territory in the middle of next year . 
a Beijing-controlled Selection Committee is in the final stages of picking the man who will succeed Patten as the head of post-colonial Hong Kong and will name the 60-member interim legislature by the end of the month . 
Lord met Patten and his deputy Anson Chan as well as members of the Legislative Council and the Trade Development Council . 
he also met Zhou Nan , head of Xinhua news agency &apos;s Hong Kong branch , China &apos;s de facto embassy in the British territory . 
but it was his meeting with shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa , frontrunner in the race for post-handover chief executive , that prompted criticism from the territory &apos;s pro-democracy camp , which said Washington appeared to be ordaining a winner ahead of the Selection Committee &apos;s decision , expected on December 11 . 
Lord said his meeting with Tung , who is an acquaintance of his wife , author Bette Bao Lord , was a personal visit with &quot; no political significance &quot; . 
&quot; I &apos;ve seen him on previous trips -- it would have been strange if I hadn &apos;t seen him on this trip , &quot; he said . 
China and the United States have many issues of concern beyond the handover of Hong Kong . 
Lord , who visited China in an unannounced trip in October , said Washington had raised the issue of human rights with Beijing frequently in talks but was looking for better progress . 
&quot; We are not satisfied with the progress on this issue and we will keep raising it . 
the full potential of our relationship with China cannot be realised until the human rights situation makes progress , &quot; Lord said . 
in addition to human rights , Beijing and Washington have had differences over the annual review of China &apos;s Most Favoured Nation trading status , copyright protection and textile quotas . 
also at issue is the US $ 35 billion trade surplus Beijing enjoys . 
Beijing is lobbying to join the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) as a developing nation but has met with opposition from Western nations , especially the United States , which insist China &apos;s economy is too large for preferential treatment . 
&quot; Our position on the WTO will be on these economic and commercial grounds : are they meeting our concerns of market access ? 
do they have a commercially meaningful offer ? 
&quot; Lord said . 
&quot; We &apos;re not linking this to non-economic issues . 
Lord stressed the U.S. had many common interests with China , including peace on the Korean peninsula , nuclear non-proliferation , the environment and regional security . 
Lord , who is leaving government in January , said he was not likely to make another trip to China in an official capacity .
