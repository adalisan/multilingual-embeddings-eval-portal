Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said on Thursday that Israel and the PLO failed in late-night talks to close a deal to launch self-rule in the Arab West Bank town of Hebron . 
&quot; I &apos;m sorry to say that till 2 o &apos;clock this night we did not achieve any progress , &quot; the PLO leader told reporters in self-ruled Gaza . 
he said he was &quot; not optimistic &quot; a deal would be signed on Thursday . 
&quot; They are still insisting on some points which we cannot accept , they still insist on changing of the agreement , &quot; Arafat said . 
&quot; What we are asking is the honest and accurate implementation of what had been agreed upon . 
Palestinian officials said Israeli and PLO negotiators would resume talks on Thursday . 
the two sides are still trying to hammer out an agreement for Israel to hand over 80 percent of Hebron to Palestinian self-rule . 
some 400 Jews live and study in the heart of the town of about 100,000 Arabs .
