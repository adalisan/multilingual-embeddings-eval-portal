Sri Lanka &apos;s survival depends on the adoption of a new constitution , to be put to parliament before the next budget debate , a senior cabinet minister was quoted on Wednesday as saying . 
&quot; The choice is between national devastation and national survival , &quot; the state-owned Daily News quoted Justice and Constitutional Affairs Minister Gamini Lakshman Peiris as telling a seminar . 
Sri Lanka &apos;s budget is usually presented to parliament in November . 
the Daily News quoted Peiris as saying a parliamentary select committee debating the new constitution would complete the remaining chapters on devolution of power by the end of May . 
the new constitution incorporates the government &apos;s devolution proposals designed to end the war by Tamil Tiger rebels for an independent homeland in the Indian Ocean island &apos;s north and east . 
the proposals offer extensive autonomy to minority Tamils and have been opposed by hardline members of the majority Sinhalese community , who fear they could lead to the separate state the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are fighting for . 
the plan envisages the creation of several regional councils and would turn Sri Lanka into a federal state in all but name . 
a Tamil political leader said the main Tamil party and a key Moslem party , an ally of the ruling People &apos;s Alliance coalition , were close to an agreement on the boundaries of the councils , a sticking point in talks to end the war . 
he declined to give details . 
other politicians said the plan envisages carving out the mainly Sinhalese Amparai electorate from the multi-ethnic eastern province and attaching it to a neigbouring province in the island &apos;s interior . 
the rest of the eastern province will be divided into a mainly Tamil northeastern province and a southeastern province where the majority will be Moslems , they said . 
the Daily News said Peiris stressed the need to build a robust body of public opinion in favour of the devolution proposals . 
the proposals have to be approved by a two-thirds majority in parliament and then at a national referendum . 
the government says more than 50,000 people have died in the war , now in its 14th year .
