South Korean President Kim Young-sam returned home on Monday at the end of a 12-day &quot; sales diplomacy &quot; mission to Latin America , during which Korean companies pledged $ 3 billion of investment . 
the domestic media gave blanket coverage to his trail-blazing visit to the world &apos;s fastest-growing region after East Asia , where Korea and arch-rival Japan are now vying for business influence . 
a string of mega-deals signed by 42 Korean business executives accompanying Kim distracted Koreans from bad news on the economy , led by data showing a ballooning trade deficit . 
Hyundai Group agreed to take a five percent stake worth $ 500 million in Brazil &apos;s state-owned mining giant Companhia do Vale do Rio Doce . 
it also signed an agreement with the National Mining Society of Chile to study building a giant copper smelter worth at least $ 300 million . 
Samsung Group held a ground-breaking ceremony for an electronics complex in Brazil &apos;s Amazonian capital of Manaus . 
the facility will be completed by 1998 and Samsung &apos;s total investment is forecast at $ 800 million . 
LG Group signed a long-term contract with Chile to buy $ 800 million worth of copper . 
and Daewoo Group said it planned to build a vehicle assembly plant in the region , possibly in Peru . 
a jubilant Kim told reporters in Peru that trade with Latin America would grow to $ 20 billion by 2000 , and that Korean investment would rise to $ 10 billion in few years . 
two-way trade last year was $ 11.4 billion . 
&quot; Latin America is a new frontier for us , &quot; Kim said . 
&quot; We will be able to overtake Japan in Latin America . 
Japan and South Korea compete for similar export markets , and their business executives chase each other around the world in search of cheap production bases . 
South Korea has so far invested $ 3.3 billion in the region , compared with Japan &apos;s $ 14 billion . 
it ran a trade surplus with Latin America of $ 3.4 billion last year and $ 2.2 billion in the first half of 1996 . 
&quot; Korea needs a gesture trying to balance trade ties with those countries . 
we must expand investment to produce more goods there , &quot; said Min Kyun , director of the Korea Investment and Trade Promotion ( KOTRA ) . 
he added : &quot; I believe many entrepreneurs witnessed great potential and possibilities in the region . 
Latin American countries welcomed Kim with open arms , but he was reminded that the region is seeking high-technology from the Asian economic powerhouse , not low-end industries . 
governments in Central America urged Kim to try to diversify South Korean investment away from textiles . 
labour unions in those countries complain about harsh South Korean management in textile sweat shops . 
in a gesture to the region &apos;s huge agricultural industry , Korea agreed to buy 40,000 tonnes of soymeal from Brazil and 52,000 tonnes of corn from Argentina . 
to try to keep up the momentum of the enthusiasm , Kim said he would set up a Latin American Bureau at the Foreign Ministry . 
he was the first Korean head of state to visit the region . 
&quot; We have just opened the door . 
we should not repeat the same pattern as before where grandiose projects have dwindled to nothing , &quot; the Seoul Economic Daily said in an editorial .
