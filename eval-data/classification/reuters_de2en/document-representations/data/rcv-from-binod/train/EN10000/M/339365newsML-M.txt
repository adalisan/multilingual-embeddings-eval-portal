stocks closed lower on Tuesday as government steps to boost the sagging stock market were swamped by worries over the fallout from the financial failure of Hanbo Steel Co , brokers said . 
the composite index closed 1.85 points lower at a provisional 662.85 after fluctuating in a range between 653.42 and 677.63 . 
a sharp rise in late morning led by blue chips was quickly followed by heavy profit-taking . 
&quot; The steps briefly sparked buying in blue chips , but people began realising that a long-term boost would not be very big , &quot; said Shin Choong-bo , research manager at Daishin Securities . 
the finance ministry said it planned to let local investment firms issue beneficiary certificates worth between $ 1 billion and $ 1.2 billion this year to foreigners investing in domestic stocks and bonds . 
the issue totalled $ 900 million in 1996 . 
other major economic news had little immediate impact on the market . 
the finance ministry said foreign companies investing more than $ 20 million in South Korea &apos;s high technology sector would be given rent-free land for up to 20 years . 
the central Bank of Korea said it was supplying 600 billion won to the banking system to ease tight liquidity caused by Hanbo &apos;s financial failure . 
declining stocks far outpaced gainers by 564 to 234 . 
Hanbo Steel , which defaulted on debt repayments last week , and its unlisted affiliate Hanbo Corp filed for court receivership on Tuesday . 
&quot; jittery investors go this way and that very frequently and , therefore , the market is fluctuating very widely , &quot; said Hyundai Securities analyst Yoo Nam-gil . 
Hanbo &apos;s failure is widely expected to deal a serious blow to the commercial banks already battered by sagging profits because many banks have huge loan exposures to Hanbo , brokers said . 
&quot; The biggest impact from the Hanbo case will be that people began to rethink and worry about the loan portfolios and asset quality , &quot; said Namuh Rhee , head of research at Dongbang peregrine Securities in Seoul . 
banking sub-index shed 1.47 percent to 385.70 , while the broader finance sector sub-index fell 1.34 percent to 570.24 .
