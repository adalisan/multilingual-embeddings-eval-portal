Federal law enforcement agencies throughout the country were on alert Friday after a pipe bomb mailed to the FBI was blown up outside the agency &apos;s headquarters here . 
Robert Walsh , FBI special agent in charge of the San Diego office , said the agency &apos;s laboratories in Washington confirmed fragments sent there for analysis after Thursday &apos;s explosion were from a bomb . 
&quot; It looks like there were two different devices in the package similar to a pipe bomb , &quot; said Walsh , adding that all FBI offices and other federal and California law enforcement agencies had been warned to be on guard for similar incidents . 
Walsh said a clerk discovered the device while X-raying packages in the mail room next to the building housing FBI offices . 
within minutes , officials evacuated some 200 employees . 
a special robot device removed the package to a nearby parking lot where it was detonated . 
Walsh said there were no suspects . 
&quot; We &apos;re at a very preliminary stage right now in our investigation , gathering all the evidence that we can and sending leads out . 
Walsh said the package was smaller than a shoe box and neatly wrapped . 
&quot; Looking at the X-ray , there were two pipes apparently tied together and wired together , and you could make out the battery pack and switch , &quot; he said .
