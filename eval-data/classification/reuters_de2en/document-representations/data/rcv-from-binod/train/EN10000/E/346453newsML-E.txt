Russia sold platinum , palladium and diamonds in 1995 and 1996 , apparently to save its economy from ruin , but the near-depletion of strategic gold stockpiles does not point to big bullion exports , officials said on Friday . 
the sales were well above planned levels , but the news has not shed much light on the exact size of secret stocks of precious metals and diamonds in Russia , which holds the key to world markets and is a major supplier . 
but a Central Bank official said gold had not been exported . 
&quot; Gold is not leaving the country , &quot; deputy press director Natalya Khomenko said . 
she said strategic reserves were nearly empty , not because they had been exported , but because the bank had bought them . 
the bank &apos;s gold reserves , used to defend the rouble and kept separately from strategic stocks , were 400 tonnes , she said . 
the size of Russia &apos;s precious metals stockpiles , especially platinum , is of major interest to world metals markets , and Moscow &apos;s gold sales have in the past moved prices furiously . 
but platinum , palladium and diamond reserves are a fiercely-guarded state secret , so clues are welcome . 
a senior source at Russia &apos;s Audit Chamber said Russia sold gems and precious metals in higher than planned quantities in 1995 and 1996 . 
the source told Reuters that 1995 exports of precious metals and diamonds were 50 percent above the 4.6 trillion roubles ( $ 1 billion at end-1995 exchange rates ) planned in the budget . 
he said 1996 sales were twice the planned level of 4.5-4.6 trillion roubles ( then worth about $ 800 million ) . 
&quot; They would seem to be pretty authoritative numbers , given that they &apos;re coming from the audit office , &quot; said one European metals analyst . 
&quot; confusion , uncertainty , grain of salt -- those are the key words . 
again , we don &apos;t know what the starting point was , truth be told . 
the Audit Chamber is a little-known , powerful independent body responsible for checking how revenue and expenditure targets in the budget and at state organisations are met . 
&quot; What it boils down to is that the sales are probably not great news for the government , because it shows that they need to find all the cash they can get , &quot; said mining specialist Raj Kohli at Paribas Capital Markets in London . 
Russia is one of the world &apos;s top producers of platinum and its sister-metal , palladium . 
its gold reserves in the ground are the world &apos;s third-largest biggest , while its rough diamonds accounted for about one quarter of De Beers annual sales of rough gems . 
a second Audit Chamber source said Russia &apos;s diamond stockpile could run out between March 1998 and September 1998 unless it were replenished . 
Russia &apos;s gem mines require vast investment . 
the extra gem and metals sales in 1995 and 1996 took place as Russia , struggling to revive its economy and breathe life into market reforms , sought to cover budget revenue shortfalls . 
&quot; Maybe it &apos;s because revenues from privatisation were less and they needed other sources of revenue , &quot; the first Audit Chamber source said . 
metals analysts in London and Johannesburg have long believed that Russia has been selling platinum and palladium stockpiles to earn much-needed foreign currency .
