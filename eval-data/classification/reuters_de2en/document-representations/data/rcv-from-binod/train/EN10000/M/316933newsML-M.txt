U.S. Treasury prices were little changed at midday on Friday , having reacted only mildly to several pieces of economic news . 
the Federal Reserve &apos;s data on November industrial production was also stronger than economists had anticipated . 
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond slipped about a quarter of a point on that news , but the retreat was short-lived . 
Joshua Feinman , vice president and global markets economist at Bankers Trust , said one reason the market staged only brief , mild reactions to the strong economic reports was that investors already know , and have discounted , a strong fourth quarter . 
&quot; The fourth quarter is going to be strong , &quot; said Feinman . 
&quot; Everybody knows that . 
the market has backed up 40 or 50 basis points on that . 
more evidence of fourth-quarter growth will not move the market . 
it &apos;s a &apos; been there , done that &apos; trade . 
Feinman said two issues that are key ingredients of near-term Fed monetary policy remain unresolved . 
&quot; What matters is how much of the fourth-quarter momentum will move into the first half of the year , &quot; said Feinman . 
&quot; And there &apos;s still no smoking gun on inflation . 
&quot; Therefore , &quot; said Feinman , &quot; the Fed is not likely to move in February . 
the market might see that scenario as altered if the fourth-quarter Employment Cost Index ( ECI ) , due January 28 , comes in strong , Feinman said . 
&quot; One percent or more on the ECI would be trouble for the market , &quot; said Feinman . 
&quot; An eight-tenths of a percent rise would be ok . something less than that would be good news . 
Chris Rupkey , vice president and economist at Bank of Tokyo / Mitsubishi , said technicals also influenced trading . 
&quot; The level we were at after the bounce on Michigan sentiment was exactly where we were at a quarter to one on Thursday when Fed Governor Laurence Meyer &apos;s comments caused some selling , &quot; said Rupkey . 
&quot; That level was 111-06 on the March T-bond contract which magically was the high in today &apos;s trading . 
Rupkey said participants &quot; are weighing what they want to do ahead of ( Fed Chairman Alan ) Greenspan &apos;s ( Congressional ) testimony on Tuesday . 
&quot; Flows are both ways here , &quot; said Rupkey . 
&quot; People are afraid of a warning from Greenspan on Tuesday , but at the same time , investors &apos; ability to guess at what they key words will be out of a long testimony is Mission Impossible . 
the market will be closed on Monday in honor of the birthday of the Rev. 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . , the American civil rights leader .
