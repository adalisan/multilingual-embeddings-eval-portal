shares extended Wednesday &apos;s losses on Thursday , hit by strength in the markka amid talk of a link to ERM and a profit warning from Kone , brokers said . 
the HEX fell 0.57 percent to 2,130.09 in solid 400 million markka volume , much of it due to a big deal in plastic pipe and furniture group asko as energy group Neste upped its stake to 26 percent from about 20 percent at the end of 1995 . 
brokers expected the slide to continue on Friday , with the markka appearing to hold gains and Wall Street weak at the open . 
some saw more downside in Kone -- even though the stock slumped more than 10 percent , or 55.00 markka , to end at 480.00 markka after it said 1996 profit would be close to zero . 
asko closed up 5.00 markka at 250 after hitting a two-year high 253.00 markka , but Neste lost 2.00 markka to 93.00 as some players had a negative view of its purchase , brokers said . 
forestries were particularly hit by the markka &apos;s strength , brokers said . 
&quot; Some investors are probably selling Finnish forestries and buying Swedish , &quot; a broker said , adding that there were fears Finland forest sector &apos;s competitiveness could suffer if the markka was linked to Europe &apos;s exchange rate mechanism . 
Nokia shed 0.50 markka at 193.00 in modest trade in line with overnight losses on Wall Street .
