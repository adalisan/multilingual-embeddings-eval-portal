House Speaker Newt Gingrich &apos;s already precarious political perch got a little wobblier Monday when a Republican lawmaker called for his removal , labeling him &quot; roadkill on the highway of American politics . 
writing in the conservative Weekly Standard , New York Republican Representative Peter King called Gingrich &quot; the most powerful liberal in American politics &quot; and said he should &quot; be replaced as speaker because he is killing us . 
&quot; As roadkill on the highway of American politics , Newt Gingrich cannot sell the Republican agenda , &quot; King said . 
echoing complaints of other disaffected Republicans , King complained Gingrich and other House leaders had lost their political nerve and had no political agenda . 
the New York lawmaker accused Gingrich of running toward the safe political centre , barring Republicans from addressing affirmative action and other conservative efforts . 
Gingrich was travelling in Asia and his staff could not immediately comment on the King article . 
House Majority Whip Tom delay , a Texas Republican , reacted angrily when shown a copy of the Weekly Standard on Fox television Sunday . 
&quot; I &apos;m going to save that Weekly Standard for this time next year . 
and I think pundits like The Weekly Standard will have egg all over their cover when they see that we have accomplished the things we set out to accomplish , &quot; delay said . 
the article is the latest note in what seems a growing chorus of opposition to Gingrich by his own party . 
last week , 11 House conservatives blocked a measure providing millions of dollars to investigate alleged White House fund-raising problems , protesting the lack of action on a balanced budget and other Republican priorities . 
Gingrich is trying to recover politically from a House vote earlier this year to reprimand him for ethics abuses . 
he tried to fight back Friday , giving a speech to underscore his commitment to tax cuts and defending his leadership .
