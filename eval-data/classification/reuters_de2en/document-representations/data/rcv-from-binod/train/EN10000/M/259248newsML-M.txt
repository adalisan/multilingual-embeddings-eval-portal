the Sri Lanka rupee closed firm due to continuous selling of dollars , dealers said . 
the rupee closed at 56.69 , after opening at its previous closing level of 56.70 , they said . 
&quot; The rupee gained on early selling of dollars by a foreign name , and stayed firm as banks generated the local currency when call rates rose slightly , &quot; said a Commercial Bank dealer . 
overnight call rates went to 14.5 percent after opening at 13.75 , dealers said . 
&quot; Even this marginal rise in call money saw banks generating rupees , because dollar rupee trade was dull , and banks had excess dollars , &quot; said a Sampath Bank dealer . 
a dull forex market saw banks opt for a high yielding currency , which served to keep the dollar down locally despite the U.S. unit &apos;s overseas strength , he said . 
the Central Bank pushed up the dollar by 1.5 local cents in line with its overseas movement , and set buying and selling prices at 56.0909 and 57.2241 .
