ousted Indonesian minority party leader Megawati Sukarnoputri sued the government on Tuesday in an attempt to force its acceptance of a list of her candidates to run in next year &apos;s general election . 
the official General Election Institute ( LPU ) last month refused to accept a list of candidates put forward by Megawati supporters after it had received a list from the government-backed faction of the Indonesian Democratic Party ( PDI ) . 
Tambunan , head of Megawati &apos;s legal team , told reporters at the Central Jakarta State Court that the new suit was against the LPU and its chairman , Interior Minster Yogie Memet . 
&quot; We are suing ( them ) so the court can order the LPU to receive a list of candidates forwarded by the Megawati &apos;s ( PDI ) executive board , &quot; Tambunan said , flanked by Megawati loyalist and ousted party secretary-general Alexander Litaay . 
&quot; Megawati &apos;s leadership is legal and she has the right to contest the election and put forward a candidates &apos; list , &quot; he told reporters when filing the suit at a Jakarta court . 
&quot; The LPU , which has been authorised by the president to conduct the elections , has the obligation to receive the candidates put forward by Megawati , &quot; he added . 
Megawati was ousted by party rival and deputy parliamentary speaker Surjadi at a government-funded PDI congress in June . 
the Central Jakarta State Court is expected to rule on Thursday whether it has the authority to continue to hear Megawati &apos;s case challenging the decision of the congress and the support of government and military figures for the congress . 
despite the call by a high-profile Moslem leader and Megawati supporter Abdurrachman Wahid to withdraw her suit against the government , Tambunan said they would continue to fight in court . 
&quot; It will not be withdrawn , &quot; Tambunan said on Tuesday . 
Megawati has filed another law suit against the East Jakarta mayor after he sealed a temporary headquarters set up by her supporters for violating zoning regulations . 
the suit in the State Adminstrative Court claims the closure was beyond his powers . 
the eviction by police of Megawati loyalists from PDI party headquarters in Central Jakarta on July 27 sparked the worst rioting in Jakarta in more than 20 years in which at least five people died , 149 were injured and 74 were reported missing .
