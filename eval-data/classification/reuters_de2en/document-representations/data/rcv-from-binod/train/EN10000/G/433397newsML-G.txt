reports of violence against gay men and lesbians rose last year despite a marked drop in violent crime around the country , according to a study released Tuesday by two watchdog groups . 
the report found a 6 percent increase in anti-gay violence , based on data collected by 14 community-based programmes . 
it was issued by the National Coalition of anti-violence and the New York City Gay and Lesbian anti-violence Project . 
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno , in response to the report by the National Coalition of anti-violence , issued a statement from Washington deploring so-called hate crimes . 
&quot; Recent reports , including data from the FBI , have shown a disturbing rise in the number of hate crimes based on race , colour , national origin , religion and secxual orientation , &quot; she said , calling on Congress to bolster the ability of the government to deal with such crimes . 
Reno said federal statutes do not permit prosecution of crimes motivated by a victim &apos;s sexual orientation but , under the 1994 Crime Act , anyone who otherwise violates federal law can be sentenced to a longer prison term if they commit the crime because of a victim &apos;s sexual orientation . 
the report documented a total of 2,529 anti-gay incidents last year . 
a vast majority -- 95 percent -- were aimed at individuals and the rest were crimes against property such as graffiti and vandalism , the report said . 
the number of victims injured rose to 867 from 775 the previous year , but the number of murders dropped to 21 from 29 the year before , it said . 
most incidents occurred near victims &apos; homes , on the street or in a public area , and just one in ten occured at or near a gay bar or event , it said . 
in what appeared to be a pattern that anti-gay violence increases when the community is most visible , the report said , the highest number of bias attacks occurred in June , which was Lesbian and Gay Pride Month . 
two-thirds of the offenders were under 30 years old , and 85 percent were male , it said . 
the most commonly used weapons were thrown objects such as bricks or bottles and hand-held objects such as bats or clubs . 
anti-gay violence rose in Chicago , Cleveland and Los Angeles but dropped in New York City , Phoenix and St. Louis , the report said . 
in several metropolitan areas , an increase in anti-gay violence contrasted with drops in overall violent crime of as much as 20 percent or more , it said . 
in the most significant drop in reports of anti-gay violence ever documented by the groups in a single year , the report found 575 anti-gay incidents in New York City , down 8 percent from 1995 . 
that was still less of a drop than the overall decrease in violent crime of more that 15 percent reported by the New York City Police Department , it said .
