Cyprus displayed its military hardware on Tuesday , including newly-acquired Russian tanks , and visiting Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said the Cypriot forces were ready for any Turkish aggression . 
&quot; There is a deterrent force in Cyprus which can deal blows to the opponent , &quot; Simitis told journalists at the end of a Cyprus Independence Day military parade in the capital Nicosia . 
&quot; It ( the opponent ) should think carefully before attempting anything , &quot; the Greek Prime Minister added . 
thousands of people turned out to watch the parade of hardware ranging from T-80 tanks and armoured personnel carriers to rockets and launchers . 
police helicopters hovered overhead in formation . 
the eastern Mediterranean island , divided since Turkey invaded the northern third in 1974 after a brief coup engineered by the colonels ruling Greece at the time , has a defence pact with Athens . 
&quot; The parade showed the forces preparedness for fighting and their prudence in the face of Turkish aggression , &quot; Simitis said . 
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides , who took the salute at the parade with Simitis , said the parade showed &quot; people could sleep at night &quot; . 
the display drew an unprecedented number of spectators . 
from early morning main roads to Nicosia were blocked by traffic as thousands of people from all over the island gathered in bright sunshine to watch the annual parade and to cheer Simitis . 
schoolchildren waving yellow-and-white Cypriot flags and blue and white Greek ones lined the route Simitis took to the capital . 
Cyprus gained independence from Britain in 1960 . 
the parade was temporarily disrupted when a man climbed onto a nearby water tower with a Turkish flag he intended burning , witnesses said . 
he was pulled off and arrested by police . 
Clerides on Monday said Cyprus would continue to strengthen defences until a way is found to reunify the country and remove Turkish troops . 
the protracted dispute has drawn a small army of mediators from the United Nations and other interested countries , but none has been able to find mutually acceptable terms for the island &apos;s reunification as a bicommunal bizonal federation . 
Turkey maintains some 30,000 troops in the north of Cyprus , declared a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in 1983 but recognised only by Ankara . 
Simitis is on his first visit outside Greece since winning national elections last week . 
it is the first visit by a Greek prime minister to the east Mediterranean island &apos;s independence day celebrations .
