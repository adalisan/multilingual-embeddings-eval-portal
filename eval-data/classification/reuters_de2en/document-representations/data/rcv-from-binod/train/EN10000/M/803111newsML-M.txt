the mark drifted on its crosses but activity was lacklustre with most of Europe on holiday and the focus on mark / yen which scaled to two-week peaks on Friday . 
&quot; It is very quiet . 
mark / yen is firmer and that is the main feature , &quot; said a trader at European bank . 
analysts said the mark got a boost in overnight dealings after Bundesbank vice president Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said the central bank was concerned about consumer price inflation . 
Gaddum , in an interview with German daily newspaper Handelsblatt , also said the Bundesbank wanted leeway to act on its top money-market rate , the repo . 
the mark , however , later drifted . 
at 1000 GMT mark / French franc was at 3.3704 / 09 against 3.3712 / 14 in late Europe Thursday . 
against the Nordic currencies , the German unit was well off four-week peaks hit on Thursday . 
mark / Norway stood at 4.1455 / 85 against 4.1410 / 40 in late Europe . 
mark / Swedish crown was softer , trading at 4.3500 / 30 against 4.3610 / 40 . 
traders said the mark was taking a breather in Europe on Friday as it awaited a raft of market-moving factors including the Bundesbank &apos;s regular repurchase tender on Tuesday , the IFO economic survey on Wednesday and the Bundesbank &apos;s first regular policy council meeting on Thursday after the summer break . 
m3 money supply , is due to be released between Tuesday and Thursday . 
&quot; I think that into the repo tender on Tuesday the mark is going to retain a stronger bias . 
elsewhere , the mark scaled to two-week peaks of 64.43 against the yen as the market banked on rates in Germany heading higher before rates in Japan . 
at 1000 GMT mark / yen was at 64.34 / 37 against 63.87 / 90 in late Europe on Thursday .
