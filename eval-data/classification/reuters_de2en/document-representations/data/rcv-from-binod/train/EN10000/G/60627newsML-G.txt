the Americans will rely on strength in depth against the bigger international stars of Europe when they defend the women &apos;s Solheim Cup at the St Pierre Club in Wales this weekend . 
the U.S. will also be trying to avoid the unprecedented humiliation of seeing all four of golf &apos;s international team titles resting in alien hands . 
the Ryder Cup , the men &apos;s equivalent of the Solheim , is held by Europe after their victory at oak Hill , Rochester , last year . 
the golfers from Britain and Ireland also hold the Walker and Curtis Cups , the men &apos;s and women &apos;s amateur team championships . 
the U.S. team face a further hurdle as the three previous Solheim Cups have all been won by the home side . 
if the Americans need more hurdles to clear , the European team also possess the top three players on the world rankings in number one Laura Davies of Britain , the beating heart of their squad , and Swedes Annika Sorenstam and Liselotte Neumann . 
the inspirational Davies , who loves speeding round the world &apos;s motorways in her Ferrari , has regained the world top spot this year with seven victories , five on the U.S. Tour and the most recent just last Sunday in the English Open . 
Sorenstam relieved Davies of the rankings lead last year after winning the U.S. Open and becoming the first player to top the U.S. and European money lists in the same year . 
she has dropped back to second in 1996 despite retaining her U.S. Open title . 
the resurgent Neumann has also been having a fine year with three victories on the U.S. Tour to her credit . 
against this imposing top three , the Americans count on their far greater depth with players who hold positions five to 10 on the rankings with six more in the top 22 . 
&quot; You don &apos;t have to be a rocket scientist to work out that , on paper , they are stronger in depth , &quot; Davies has said . 
&quot; They can play average and beat us . 
whereas all 12 of us have to be playing well . 
we &apos;ve got to raise our game . 
while Davies may be the inspiration of the European team , the Americans have on their squad the feisty Dottie PEPPER , who as Dottie Mochrie in 1994 took her intensity to the dubious extent of cheering missed putts by the Europeans . 
she is also the top-ranked American on the world list at number five after three wins this year . 
the format has been expanded again this year and is now identical to the Ryder Cup with four foursomes and four fourball matches on Friday and Saturday and 12 singles matches involving all the players from both teams on Sunday . 
the Americans won the inaugural event in 1990 at Lake Nona by a whopping 11-1 / 2 to 4-1 / 2 and regained the title two years ago at the Greenbrier , West Virginia , by 13-7 . 
Europe won the title at Dalmahoy , in Scotland , in 1992 by 11 -1 / 2 points to 6-1 / 2 . 
teams : 
United States - Pat Bradley , Brandie Burton , Beth Daniel , Jane Geddes , Rosie Jones , Betsy King , Meg Mallon , Michelle McGann , Dottie PEPPER , Kelly Robbins , Patty Sheehan , Val Skinner .
