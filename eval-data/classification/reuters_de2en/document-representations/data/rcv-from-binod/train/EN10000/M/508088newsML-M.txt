------------------------ ( April 14 ) ----------------------------- 
* Stocks ended weaker but off lows in muted reaction to the Dow &apos;s sharp fall on Friday . 
Australian shares ended mildly weaker on Monday in a muted reaction to a sharp sell-off on Wall Street on Friday which followed a surprising jump in U.S. wholesale prices . 
the Australian Stock Exchange &apos;s benchmark All Ordinaries index ended 14.4 points lower at 2,366.1 , well off its intra-day low of 2,349.1 . 
the June share price index closed five points down at 2,356 , a 10.1 point discount to the underlying index . 
dealers said investors marked down blue chip issues by about one percent early but recovered nearly half these losses over the course of the session as bargain hunters emerged . 
&quot; You can &apos;t draw too many conclusions - total market turnover was pretty low . 
overall , the market is behaving logically when you consider Australia &apos;s economy is in a different phase to America &apos;s , &quot; a Brisbane-based dealer said . 
the dealer said the low turnover also reflected a considerable amount of investor caution in respect of possible further volatility on Wall Street . 
&quot; I think if Wall Street market bounces even slightly tonight you should see quite a few buyers step into the market tomorow morning , &quot; the dealer said . 
major bank issues remained in the spotlight following last week &apos;s release of the much-awaited Wallis inquiry into Australia &apos;s financial system . 
Westpac Banking Corp and Commonwealth Bank of Australia were the best supported of the big four , both finishing slightly firmer after opening lower . 
there was also good buying interest in oil and gas hopeful Cultus Petroleum Ltd . Cultus shares continued to push higher on positive sentiment over its prospects in Victoria &apos;s Otway Basin and the possibility of the company obtaining new exploration permits in that area . 
in other markets , Australian bond yields ended a thinly traded session higher in the wake of Friday &apos;s sell-off in U.S. treasuries , although the short end gave up only a little ground . 
the yield on 10-year T-bonds closed at 8.02 percent , up 0.08 points from Friday &apos;s close . 
the Australian dollar sagged more than 1 / 3 of a cent through a slow Monday session as the weight of worry over eroding yield premiums undermined support .
