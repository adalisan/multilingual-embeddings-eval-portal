a Turkish opposition leader was to meet MPs from his left-wing party on Wednesday to discuss a new government formula that would exclude the ruling Islamists from power . 
Party officials said veteran Bulent Ecevit , a former prime minister , would report to his Democratic Left Party later in the day on his efforts to cement a secularist alliance . 
Ecevit failed to get the full backing of rival left-wing leader Deniz Baykal for a broad-based government to replace Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan &apos;s coalition with conservatives . 
&quot; We are talking about possible alternatives but we first have to get rid of this government , &quot; Baykal said after talks on Tuesday . 
Erbakan has come under fire from Turkey &apos;s secularists , led by the army , for plans to introduce Islam into public life . 
he challenged the opposition to go for early polls . 
cooperation between the secularist parties has often been hindered by bitter political and personal rivalries .
