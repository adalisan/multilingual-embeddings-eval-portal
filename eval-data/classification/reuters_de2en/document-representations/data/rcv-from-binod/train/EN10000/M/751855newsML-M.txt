U.S. debt futures ended mixed with the long end down slightly after quiet trade . 
traders said mild profit-taking and a weak jobless claims figure kept debt futures soft much of the day . 
&quot; The market sold off after the number and it doesn &apos;t have much conviction right now , &quot; a Eurodollar trader said . 
the latest weekly jobless claims dropped more than expected to 299,000 from a revised 341,000 in the prior week . 
Second-quarter employment cost index will be the next market stimulus , traders said . 
the previous report showed a 0.6 percent gain . 
&quot; Yesterday and today we certainly saw a little bit of profit-taking , and people are going to remain conservative going to next week , &quot; said Kurt Fraim , futures analyst with Aubrey G. Lanston . 
&quot; We could see more of this tomorrow and into Monday , &quot; he said . 
September Treasury bond futures were underpinned by a support band from 114-29 / 32 to 115-2 / 32 , but they failed to muster the strength to challenge Wednesday &apos;s high of 115-23 / 32 . 
further support rests at 114-23 / 32 . 
a Eurodollar trader said the market could remain edgy , wary that more profit-taking may kick in after this week &apos;s gains and before the weekend . 
he pegged December Euro support at 94.12 and 94.02 , with resistance at 94.15-16 and 94.19 . 
at the close , September T-bonds were down 2 / 32 at 115-10 / 32 , 10-year notes were flat at 110-05 / 32 , and December Eurodollars were flat at 94.135 .
