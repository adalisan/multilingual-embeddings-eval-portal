profit taking continued to weigh on CME live cattle futures but underlying support remained in nearbys from strong cash markets . 
feeder cattle slipped again at the close after rallying near midday . 
live cattle closed 0.250 cent higher to 0.375 lower with only June up and April off 0.150 cent . 
feeders ended 0.575 to 0.300 lower with March off 0.350 at 68.325 cents . 
late short covering pared losses but the profit taking following recent posting of contract highs kept a lid on live cattle futures . 
rolling long positions into June also weighed on the nearby , traders said . 
spreading of long June / short April was evident , likely to get ahead of expected fund rolling late next week . 
added pressure in deferred months came from the outlook for increased fed cattle supplies later , they said . 
underlying support in April reflected strong cash markets . 
heavy-weight choice boxed beef price has risen over $ 9 per cwt in the past week and moved up to its highest price level since December 31 . 
fed cattle prices jumped $ 3 this week to mostly $ 69 per cwt , instances as high as $ 70 per cwt . 
further strength is seen in cash markets going into next week , traders added . 
in live cattle options , April volatility was steady to strong with commission houses buying and selling 70 strikes and buying 68 puts . 
volatility in June was firm on 68 / 70 call spreading , pit sources said . 
feeder cattle futures rallied late following action in other meat pits but fell again at the close . 
weakness in deferred live cattle and higher corn futures , along with ideas of increased feeder cattle supplies ahead , continued to weigh on the market , traders said . 
however , not all ideas were for rising feeder supplies . 
even though there are expectations of a seasonal rise in feeder supplies , most analysts are saying many spring feeders have already moved to feedlots at lighter weights . 
this will cut offerings later , they said . 
the latest CME feeder cattle index was up $ 0.09 at $ 69.10 per cwt . 
locals sold again at the close with some closing stops adding to pressure to the closing bell , pit sources said .
