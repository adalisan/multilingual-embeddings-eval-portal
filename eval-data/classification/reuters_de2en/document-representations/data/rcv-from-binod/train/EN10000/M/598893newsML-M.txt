European cobalt prices failed to move on news that rebel forces had taken control in Zaire over the weekend after the seven-month civil war . 
despite pressure from consumers several London traders said they were not prepared to mark the price of cobalt lower as they saw the ending of Mobutu &apos;s rule as only a psychological influence . 
&quot; It has little to do with fundamentals which are unlikely to ease on the supply side , &quot; one London trader said . 
others voiced concern over production levels from cobalt / copper producer Gecamines . 
&quot; There is little if any ( cobalt ) being produced ... and even if there was , the whole infra-structure in the Shaba region is a complete mess , &quot; one trader said . 
it will take a long time to repair facilities neglected by the Mobutu regime , and planned new mines / smelters , like the giant Tenke Fungurume venture , won &apos;t be making a difference to production levels for two to three years , traders said . 
one source with contacts in the Shaba region said the security around the hub of the mining region , Lubumbashi , was still tight and having an effect on production . 
&quot; Everything is moving at a snails pace , &quot; he said . 
reports from Lubumbashi said that Zambia stopped cross-border railway traffic this month because of a dispute over debts . 
the main export route for Zaire &apos;s cobalt is to South Africa via Zambia . 
&quot; Zambia has blocked all the wagons and goods of Congolese ( Zaire &apos;s ) clients . 
we &apos;ve asked them to lift this embargo , &quot; a Zairean official told Reuters in an interview . 
according to another source cobalt Gecamines cobalt production for 1997 will only be around 2,000 tonnes , against 6,100 tonnes in 1996 . 
stocks of Gecamines cobalt in Antwerp have fallen dramatically , one trader said . 
&quot; People would be surprised how much material is actully there . 
the trader also said that much of the Gecamines material held on the ground in Zaire had been plundered before the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko . 
high grade cobalt was indicated around $ 26 a pound , up from $ 20 seen in early 1997 and lower-grade around $ 23.00 .
