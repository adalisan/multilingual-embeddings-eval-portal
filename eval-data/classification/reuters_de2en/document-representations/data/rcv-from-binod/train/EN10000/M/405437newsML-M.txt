Asian MTBE prices are set to remain steady to soft amid weaker oil prices in the near term , industry sources said on Wednesday . 
&quot; It is quite weak ... the whole energy complex is down , &quot; a trader said on the weaker crude and oil product prices . 
crude oil prices have dropped from its peak at the begining of the year to a six-month low , a trader said . 
&quot; MTBE is bearish , and finding offers at $ 270- $ 272 ( free-on-board ) is not a problem , but there is not a lot of buying , &quot; another trader said who expected prices to come down . 
traders assessed Singapore MTBE free-on-board ( fob ) prices between $ 270- $ 273 per tonne with a March parcel heard sold even as low as $ 268 . 
they said Thai refiner Bangchak Petroleum plc bought 1,500 tonnes for delivery in March in a tender which closed February 17 at $ 280-285 per tonne c-and-f . 
&quot; Supplies are relaxed because demand is not there , especially for the second half of March where there is a large inventory , &quot; he said . 
he said for some of the surplus to find an outlet in the U.S. West Coast , fob prices in Asia had to fall below $ 260 per tonne . 
producers were less bearish and quoted cost-and-freight ( c-and-f ) parcels at $ 285 , steady from last week . 
with feedstock still firm and even higher than MTBE prices , producers were unwilling to lower offers and would prefer to sell the feedstock instead . 
methanol , a major feedstock of MTBE , was priced at $ 280- $ 290 per tonne , a producer said . 
traders hoped for firmer price direction after Taiwan announced a new tender for up to two 3,500-tonne MTBE cargoes for April 6-20 delivery to Kaohsiung or Keelung which closes March 3 and valid for two days . 
in its last tender , Taiwan bought 7,000-tonnes for March 1-15 delivery from SABIC at $ 283 per tonne c-and-f Taiwan . 
Taiwan also announced a fresh tender for leaded and unleaded reformate for April 1-15 delivery . 
the tender closes March 4 and is valid until March 6 . 
Taiwan &apos;s reformate requirements might boost blending demand for MTBE which is lacklustre , traders said . 
&quot; blending demand is very thin around Singapore ... gasoline prices are not so good therefore demand will be low , &quot; a trader said . 
gasoline prices in Singapore firmed on Tuesday , but had been come off more than $ 1.00 per barrel under aggressive selling to trade at $ 26.60 on Monday .
