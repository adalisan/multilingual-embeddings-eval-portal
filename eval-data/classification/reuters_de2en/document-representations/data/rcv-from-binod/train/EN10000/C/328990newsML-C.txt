Finnish food and feed group Raision Tehtaat Oy said on Thursday it saw no real threat from a new powdered sterol that local media dubbed a &quot; challenger &quot; to Raisio &apos;s cholesterol-reducing Benecol margarine . 
&quot; We &apos;ve taken the view that no challenger exists , &quot; Raisio spokesman Sten von Hellens told Reuters by telephone . 
he referred to a report in daily Helsingin Sanomat on a powdered plant sterol substance said to have cholesterol-cutting properties and which the paper said had been patented by a Finnish inventor of a low-sodium salt . 
the substance could be added to foods such as sausage or bread , and medical tests of its effectiveness were expected to begin this spring , the newspaper said . 
&quot; This so-called challenger is using raw sterols which have rather low effect , &quot; von Hellens said . 
Raisio &apos;s Benecol margarine is based on plant sterols that are saturated into stanols and then esterified which makes them fat soluble , von Hellens said , adding that Raisio &apos;s process was patented . 
&quot; There is no clinical evidence of the effectiveness ( of the new substance reported by the newspaper ) , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There have been products like this on the market before , &quot; von Hellens said of the powdered plant sterol . 
&quot; They have been available in natural food stores . 
&quot; They are potential competitors , but it is a completely different product , &quot; he said . 
Raisio &apos;s share fell 31.00 markka , more than seven percent , to 393.00 markka on the Helsinki Stock Exchange on Thursday . 
the share has been hitting all-time highs recently , and brokers were mixed and noncommittal on whether the drop had anything to do with the report of a potential Benecol challenger .
