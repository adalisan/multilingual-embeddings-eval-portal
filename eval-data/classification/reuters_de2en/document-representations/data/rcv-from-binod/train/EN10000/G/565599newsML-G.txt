police detained a man for several hours on Wednesday after he would not let go of Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien &apos;s hand at a federal election campaign stop . 
police in Alberta &apos;s capital broke up a handshake between Chretien and a 49-year-old man after he began pulling the prime minister toward him and yelling in French . 
&quot; During that handshake he pulled the prime minister toward him , refused to release his hand and at the same time shouting his objections in French , &quot; said police spokesman Kelly Gordon . 
Gordon said the man was apparently upset that Chretien had called the election despite the worst flooding in the western Canadian province of Manitoba in 145 years . 
Gordon said the man was detained by police for three hours , but was not charged . 
the man &apos;s name was not released . 
Chretien told Canadian Press news agency that he was not unsettled by the event . 
&quot; He shook hands ( with ) me , I don &apos;t know what he was talking about . 
people push around a little bit when they are a bit enthusiastic , and it &apos;s part of democracy . 
Chretien was also confronted at the event by a protester dressed in flood-fighting gear who wanted to give him a sandbag . 
Chretien has been criticised for calling the election on April 27 , just one day after visiting Manitoba to inspect flood damage . 
last year , Chretien made headlines when he grabbed a protester by the throat in Hull , Quebec and threw him to the ground .
