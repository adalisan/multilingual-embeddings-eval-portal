U.S. Deputy Treasury Lawrence Summers said on Friday the U.S. economy was in a very healthy state and the current expansion had a long way to run . 
&quot; While there is much to be concerned about , I &apos;m able to take some satisfaction from the fact that our economy is in a very healthy situation , in many ways , a more healthy situation than it has been in at any time in my professional lifetime , &quot; Summers told a news conference in Singapore . 
he said the current combination of high investments , low inflation , a declining budget deficit and a healthy financial system suggested the U.S. economic expansion could have &quot; a very long way to run &quot; . 
as the economy approached full employment , he said , &quot; the prospects that the expansion will start to deliver rising real wages in a more clear cut way become much more aggressive .
