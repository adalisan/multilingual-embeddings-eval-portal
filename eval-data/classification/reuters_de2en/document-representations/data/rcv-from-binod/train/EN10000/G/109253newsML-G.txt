defence Secretary William Perry will visit Moscow next week to discuss closer U.S.-Russian military ties and urge Russia &apos;s legislature to approve the Start-2 strategic arms reduction treaty , the Pentagon said on Thursday . 
in a three-day visit beginning on Wednesday , Perry will meet Russian Defence Minister Igor Rodionov and speak to Russia &apos;s State Duma , the lower house of Parliament , to press for passage of additional deep nuclear weapons cuts under the treaty signed in 1993 . 
Perry will be accompanied by U.S. 
senators Sam Nunn of Georgia , Richard Lugar of Indiana and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut . 
Nunn and Lugar sponsored legislation that has provided millions of dollars to aid nuclear cuts in the former Soviet Union . 
Start-2 would require the United States and Russia to slash their nuclear arsenals to between 3,000 and 3,500 long-range warheads each by the year 2003 , a reduction of some two-thirds from Cold War levels . 
the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty by an 87-4 vote last January 26 but objections have been raised in Russia , where the economy and military forces are in turmoil . 
some legislators fear that major nuclear cuts could leave Moscow vulnerable to pressure from the West . 
Perry and Army General Rodionov met last month at a gathering of NATO defence ministers in Bergen , Norway , and Rodionov promised to continue improving Russian military ties with the alliance despite Moscow &apos;s objections to NATO enlargement into Eastern Europe .
