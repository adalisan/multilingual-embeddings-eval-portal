a live grenade was found in the doorway to a shop in Florence on Monday in what police said could be a symbolic reminder of a 1993 bombing that killed five people near the city &apos;s Uffizi art gallery . 
a bomb disposal team removed and detonated the grenade after shopkeeper Giorgio Tassini found it packaged in a gift box outside his food store in the centre of the Italian city . 
attached to the box was a ribbon with the message : &quot; Who pulls this will die &quot; . 
the grenade , of a type produced before World War Two , was found on the eve of the fourth anniversary of a car bomb attack which destroyed one wing of the Uffizi Gallery , home to a priceless collection of Renaissance art . 
five people who lived in the nearby Via dei Georgofili were killed in the night time blast , which investigators believe was the work of the Sicilian Mafia . 
public prosecutor Francesco Fleury said the writing on the packaging pointed towards a hoax but added that the timing and position of the bomb also meant a link with the Uffizi blast could not be ruled out . 
&quot; The position was near to Via dei Georgofili , the chosen day is symbolic : we will carry out investigations to see if there are any links with the anniversary , &quot; Fleury said . 
Monday &apos;s discovery followed the planting of a World War Two grenade near the Ponte Vecchio bridge in Florence last month which was detonated without incident . 
Italy &apos;s top Mafia bosses were charged last year with masterminding the Uffizi bombing and similar explosions in Rome and Milan which shook Italy in 1993 , killing a total of 10 people .
