the Monterrey National Chamber of Commerce ( Canaco ) on Tuesday came out against possible tax hikes during the next fiscal year . 
&quot; We will not accept any increases in taxes , or in wages , &quot; Canaco president Jose Mario Garza Benavides told reporters . 
&quot; Over the last ten years , it has been business and workers that have made the sacrifices , &quot; he said . 
Garza said that the Monterrey Canaco will make proposals for the national Confederation of Chambers of Commerce in order to defend its stance with the government . 
the proposals include tax breaks on fixed assets for businesses , Garza said . 
workers would meanwhile need to have tax breaks extended from four times to ten times the minimum wage in order to offset losses in purchasing power , which Garza estimated at 28 percent over the past 21 months .
