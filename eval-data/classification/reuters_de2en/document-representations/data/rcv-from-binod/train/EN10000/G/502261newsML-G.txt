Croatia &apos;s long- ruling HDZ party drew a smaller crowd than a leading opposition rival at what was meant to be its climactic pre-election rally staged in Zagreb &apos;s main square on Friday evening . 
up to 20,000 people turned out to hear President Franjo Tudjman , who heads all HDZ slates for municipal and county elections on Sunday although he is not a candidate , only hours before a 24-hour electoral silence took effect . 
only two years ago , a rally by the nationalist HDZ ( Croatian Democratic Union ) ahead of parliamentary elections had the same square packed in almost unanimous support . 
Friday &apos;s crowd filled only about two thirds of the square with space to spare and perhaps half the people could not hear or did not listen closely to Tudjman , 74 , an authoritarian former general and only broadly popular politician in Croatia . 
Tudjman &apos;s HDZ first won general elections in 1990 , shortly before Croatia proclaimed independence from federal Yugoslavia . 
it suffered its first major setback in 1995 when a loose Seven-Party coalition won a majority in Zagreb . 
Tudjman refused to cede power in the capital , exercising a &quot; national security &quot; veto to prevent an opposition takeover . 
he appointed his own provisional mayor and the affair watered down until the coalition eventually disintegrated . 
according to the latest polls , the HDZ looks poised to win most municipalities on Sunday but the outcome in some major cities , including the capital Zagreb , was uncertain . 
opposition parties are buoyed by discontent over the economy . 
a sign that the times may be changing came on Wednesday when the Social Democrats ( SDP ) , formerly communists , rallied in front of some 40,000 people , staging a show with prominent rock bands obviously aimed at a younger audience . 
the HDZ waged a strong campaign through the state-dominated media meant primarily to discredit other parties as political dilettantes while trumpeting its own role in leading Croatia to independence from Yugoslavia , won in 1991 after a war . 
the party relies heavily on the charisma of Tudjman , who is said to be suffering from stomach cancer but has regained vigour and weight of late after extensive treatment . 
but his voice on Friday was feeble and strangled . 
it kept breaking off and never once roared in the furious tone that once characterised him . 
&quot; The opposition united upon instructions from abroad to take power in Zagreb and bring about chaos like in Serbia and Albania , &quot; Tudjman told the throng . 
Western diplomats have dismissed such allegations . 
Tudjman &apos;s remarks drew mild applause . 
the crowd interrupted the speech chanting &quot; Franjo , Franjo &quot; a few times , but mainly to drown out a group of soccer fans chanting to protest at Tudjman &apos;s renaming of a top Zagreb team a few years ago . 
although the HDZ arranged to have the last in a series of election rallies in Zagreb &apos;s sprawling main square , it was one of the smaller crowds Tudjman ever addressed . 
a dozen buses were parked behind the square , indicating that a significant number of people were bused from rural HDZ strongholds outside Zagreb to augment the number of spectators . 
heavy security , including special police and anti-sniping units , were deployed on rooftops and among the crowd .
