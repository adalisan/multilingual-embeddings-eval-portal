sales of recordable compact disc players are booming and so are the sales of the software that makes these &apos; dumb &apos; drives execute the tasks of storing text , pictures and sound on a CD . 
some 1.5 million CD-R players will be sold in 1996 , 10 times more than in 1995 and at rapidly falling retail prices . 
prices are set to plunge to an estimated $ 500 at year-end from $ 1,000 in January . 
a dozen electronics manufacturers -- including all the big Japanese firms , Hewlett-Packard Co and Dutch Philips electronics NV -- have launched their first models or will do so soon , but the CD-R software industry is more concentrated . 
the CD-R software market is dominated by just three players , one of which is Dutch Elektroson which recently clinched a deal with Netscape Communications Corp and is set to sign another with the U.S. Pentagon . 
the 50-person company expects its 1996 sales to surge to $ 10 million from $ 3 million in 1995 and says the market &apos;s explosive growth is sometimes more than it and sector rivals can handle . 
the competitive pricing of the CD-R players has opened up the consumer market , as PC-users crave the storage capacity that can handle the huge multimedia files they find on the Internet . 
CD-R players are connected to a PC and usually have the shape and size of a CD-ROM drive . 
a CD-R disc can save 500 times more information than an ordinary diskette , while it costs a little more than $ 6 , a price which is seen dropping to $ 5 soon . 
Elektroson was set up in the mid-1980s by former optical disc employees of electronics giant Philips , a compact disc pioneer which controls over 50 percent of the CD-R player market and is the largest key component maker . 
several years ago Elektroson was taken over by a group of venture capitalists and radically reshaped from a technology-driven company into a marketing-driven firm by Henk Noorderhaven , executive manager and shareholder . 
the firm &apos;s main product , gear , was neatly packaged in platform-independent sets , while its U.S. support office was moved to Silicon Valley from Philadelphia and transformed into a sales organisation . 
&quot; If you want to do business in the U.S. you have to be there and you have to have an American profile , &quot; said Elektroson &apos;s general manager for Europe , Alfred Klaassen . 
the next move will have to come from marketing so-called &quot; slices of gear &quot; . 
one of these is Webgrabber , a software application that has been developed for integration in Netscape &apos;s Internet browser Navigator . 
&quot; gear is a complex product that can do it all . 
it &apos;s the most reliable and open system available , but it &apos;s not plug-and-play . 
that &apos;s one of the reasons we &apos;re developing these simpler separate systems , &quot; said product manager Paul Deckers . 
Webgrabber allows internet browsers to save files from the net directly to a CD-R . 
&quot; We &apos;re the first to bring such a programme , &quot; Klaassen said . 
Elektroson claims to be number one in Europe and U.S. runner-up behind its U.S. rival Adaptech . 
in Europe it ships 15,000 applications a month up from a total 10,000 in the full year of 1995 . 
before Christmas it plans to introduce other applications such as one that makes 1 : 1 copies of every possible CD format and one that can be used to compile audio CD-Rs from other sound recordings . 
the company is also working on a &quot; Docu-grabber &quot; for smaller offices that enables indexed mass-archiving and a &quot; tool-kit &quot; for companies to make their own custom-made gear application , for example to store presentations which combine pictures and sound . 
new digital video disc ( DVD ) technology will expand these possibilities to include big chunks of video footage . 
the company is also developing CD-Rewritable software to allow users to use one CD over and over again by erasing and reloading data . 
the application is due to come on the market in two years &apos; time . 
in the &quot; battle for the slot &quot; , DVD-Rewritable looks destined to replace CD-ROM drives in a few years time . 
Elektroson reckons that hardware companies will continue to buy its software to make these DVD-Rs function , even when sales run into many millions and become standard to a PC . 
&quot; They rather leave it to a specialised company . 
it &apos;s not just a programme you can develop yourself . 
it took us 10 years to develop a system without default , &quot; Deckers said .
