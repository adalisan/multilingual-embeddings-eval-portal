campaigners for a worldwide ban on landmines said on Monday tens of thousands of landmines had been planted in Zaire , mostly by mercenaries propping up former Zaire president Mobutu Sese Seko &apos;s regime . 
they said Zaire , renamed Democratic Republic of Congo at the weekend by self-proclaimed president Laurent Kabila , had been until 1995 one of the few countries in Africa free of landmines . 
Alex vines , head of the London-based Human Rights Watch , told Reuters : &quot; The minefields are killing people ... there are injuries as we talk . 
they were not marked . 
there were no warnings to local people . 
&quot; Basically the pattern of minefields around Kisangani is completely against all international norms and conventions , &quot; 
&quot; It is clear that many of these were laid by Serbian mercenaries who were brought in by the Mobutu government to help protect Kisangani . 
minefields were completely useless as they didn &apos;t stop Kabila &apos;s forces moving in very quickly . 
he said the first report of landmines in Zaire was on October 24 , 1995 at Goma , on the eastern border with Rwanda . 
&quot; There aren &apos;t set minefields around Goma . 
the only set fields are around Kisangani , &quot; he said . 
although it was too early to dicuss clearing of landmines in Zaire , vines said : &quot; International aid will have to be used to clear those mines . 
there will need to be rapid deployment patrols when there are reports of landmines to go clear . 
it costs on average $ 2.50 to make a landmine and around $ 1,000 to clear one . 
forty-one African countries are meeting in Kempton Park outside Johannesburg from Monday in the first government-sponsored conference on landmines . 
campaigners from 20 countries are attending the conference to urge their governments to ban and destroy all stockpiles of anti-personnel mines by the year 2000 . 
southern Africa is the world &apos;s most heavily mined region , with an estimated 20 million mines , of which just 400,000 have been removed since serious mine clearing began in 1991 . 
although many governments in southern Africa have called for a total ban , only South Africa and Mozambique have officially banned anti-personnel landmines .
