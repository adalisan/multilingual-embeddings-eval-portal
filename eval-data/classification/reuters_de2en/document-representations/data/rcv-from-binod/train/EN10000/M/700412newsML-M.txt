September Notionnel futures traded on MATIF have the potential to move higher eventually but may first move down on Tuesday towards key support around 128.90 , technical analysts said . 
&quot; The notionnel hasn &apos;t started positively . 
it has come off since the opening and will probably test critical support around the 128.90 area , &quot; said Adrian sells , director of crane Investment Analysis in London . 
but he said the underlying market looked good and a break out and close above the 129.50 area would continue the upside potential . 
sells said in the short term some preliminary support was offered at 129.02 . 
at 0805 GMT , September notionnel futures were at 129.08 , down 14 basis points on the day . 
&quot; For today notionnel might well be capped by the opening but if we get above 129.24 then we &apos;ll get a challenge set up towards 129.50 , &quot; sells said . 
technical analysts at a European bank in London also saw the overall picture for the contract as constructive . 
&quot; So far ( notionnel ) has kept above 129.00 . 
more important is 128.40 which it must hold to avoid a drop in momentum , &quot; they said in a research note . 
at the short end , September Pibor was at 96.54 , down 0.01 on the day . 
the European bank analysts said a break below 96.50 would negate the recent bullish break , but while the picture stayed constructive there were good prospects for putting 96.65 under pressure .
