Irish police arrested five men under counter-terrorism laws close to the border with British Northern Ireland , officers said on Thursday . 
the arrests on Wednesday evening were made close to the scene of the discovery of a suspected guerrilla training camp last weekend . 
security sources declined to say if the two events were connected . 
police said two of the men were in an inflatable boat off the north county Donegal near Malin Head , Ireland &apos;s most northernly point , when they were detained . 
the craft , a &quot; jeep &quot; vehicle , camouflage netting , food and ground sheets were also seized , superintendent Kevin Lennon told Reuters . 
last Sunday police found guns and a primed rocket in a suspected guerrilla training camp in the Malin Head area . 
five Northern Ireland men detained at that time were later charged in the Irish capital Dublin with possessing guns and ammunition . 
police said that no guns were found during Wednesday night &apos;s operation . 
&quot; We are not linking it ( the arrest operation ) to anything at the moment , &quot; Lennon said . 
the men detained on Wednesday are all from Northern Ireland where the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) guerrilla group is fighting to end British rule . 
they were arrested under the Offences Against the State Act and can be held without charge for 48 hours . 
after Sunday &apos;s raid , police said they were convinced they had thwarted an attack on British troops or police officers in Northern Ireland . 
security sources on both sides of the border say the IRA , which relaunched a war against British rule in February , has huge quantities of arms and explosives hidden in the Irish Republic .
