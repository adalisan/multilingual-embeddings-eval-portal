Germany &apos;s DAX-30 share index could reach 3,400-3,500 points over 1997 , Rolf Passow , managing director of Deutsche Investment Trust , the funds wing of Germany &apos;s Dresdner Bank , said on Wednesday . 
Passow also said that the prospect of the U.S. dollar hitting 1.70 marks was &quot; absolutely realistic &quot; , and did not rule out a short-term overshoot of this level . 
Passow said the group had upped its forecast for the DAX from 3,200 points , because pension and tax reform in Germany would lead to a change in investment patterns in the medium-term . 
&quot; We are talking about a &quot; golden scenario &quot; at the moment , in a context defined by careful growth , free of tensions , combined with low interest rates , &quot; said Passow . 
the earnings dynamic of the &quot; old continent &quot; is clearly higher than that of the United States and as far as buying and selling shares is concerned , Europe is very much at the centre , &quot; said Passow . 
Passow said that restructuring within German listed companies was continuing apace , and that increased corporate earnings were being simultaneously boosted by improved export outlooks , a weaker deutschemark and reform of corporate taxes . 
in particular , the MDAX index of German medium-sized companies could expect to benefit from an improved corporate tax environment , as many MDAX companies earnings &apos; centres were in Germany . 
looking further afield , dit forecast further growth in eastern and central European share markets , especially in Poland and in the Czech Republic .
