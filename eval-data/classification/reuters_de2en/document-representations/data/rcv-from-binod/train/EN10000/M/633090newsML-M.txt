Mediterranean oil products were weaker on Tuesday as futures markets tumbled and fuel was given an extra downwards push by a deal at unexpectedly low numbers , traders said . 
gasoline prices fell with futures . 
while supply in the prompt period remains tight , availabilities of leaded and unleaded gasoline were seen from the Italian islands in the second half of the month . 
Naphtha was weaker too , and buyers in NWE reported a fresh Greek availability , loading some time in early to mid June . 
gas oil continued to be a mixed bag with 0.02 percent material under pressure by large quantities of Russian gas oil . 
traders said premiums for 0.02 percent material were being quoted at quotes fob hi flat / + $ 1.0 , although many thought sellers would have to be extremely &quot; lucky &quot; to get + $ 1 . 
low sulphur diesel , meanwhile , remained tight with many refiners saying they would not be offering low sulphur product until late June while arbitrage opportunities to the north sucked up Algerian material . 
low sulphur was assessed at around quotes fob hi + $ 2.0 / + $ 3.0 a tonne . 
high sulphur fuel markets were jolted by reports of a trader to trader deal for Italian fob barrels at $ 75 a tonne , some way below current physical and swaps numbers . 
with June paper at $ 77 / $ 78 and prompt supply thin , dealers were perturbed by the effect on prices the deal would have . 
one of the parties was believed pricing large Italian cargoes this month 
Russians were scarce , with one vessel out of Odessa seen as an obvious candidate to fill the rather prompt Turkish high sulphur buy tender . 
delivery date is June 12-14 . 
a stored Russian straight-run was heard traded out of Tunisia into an Italian refiner .
