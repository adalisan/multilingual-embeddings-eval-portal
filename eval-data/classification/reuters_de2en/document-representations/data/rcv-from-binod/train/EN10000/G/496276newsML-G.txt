intense gunfire and mortar bomb explosions broke out on Wednesday in the suburbs of Zaire &apos;s second city Lubumbashi , witnesses said . 
Reuters correspondent Richard Meares said the fighting was in the southern suburbs of the city and much closer than explosions that had been heard on Monday and Tuesday on the city outskirts . 
he said wild shouts of joy could be heard from crowds less than one kilometre from his hotel , along with chants of &quot; Kabila , Kabila &quot; . 
hours earlier , residents of Lubumbashi reported that people had fled the city centre which was now deserted . 
government soldiers were commandeering vehicles in the city , they said .
