the South Korean won ended at new 84-month low against the U.S. currency on Monday on speculative dollar buying , dealers said . 
they attributed the plunge to the widening current account deficit and the dollar &apos;s strength on world markets . 
they added that rising inter-Korean tension was only minor factor in the day &apos;s won / dollar movement . 
the won ended at 880.00 after opening at 876.70 . 
this is the lowest level seen since the market average system was introduced in March 1990 . 
the won touched a high of 875.00 
South Korea posted a record current account deficit of $ 23.72 billion in 1996 , compared to a shortfall of $ 8.95 billion in 1995 , the central bank figures showed . 
&quot; Players are convinced the dollar will continue to rise , so they are speculatively buying the unit , &quot; said a western bank dealer . 
the central bank stepped into the market early in the day to sell dollars , but the half-hearted intervention failed to prevent the won from falling further . 
the central bank has refused to confirm or deny that it intervenes in the interbank market . 
&quot; I think the BOK is saving up its ammunition for one major intervention that will be more effective , &quot; a local dealer said . 
dealers said they expected the won to move in a 880-883 range on Tuesday . 
Tuesday &apos;s mid-rate is estimated to be pegged at 878.80 against 875.00 today . 
the shooting of prominent defector Li Il-nam on Saturday by suspected North Korean agents triggered fears of growing tension on the Korean peninsula . 
the shooting appeared to be a warning to Seoul and potential asylum seekers after a high-ranking Pyongyang official sought political asylum at the South Korean embassy in Beijing last week .
