the Indonesian rupiah rose sharply to 2,900 against the dollar at 0700 GMT from an early low of 3,045 on offshore buying , dealers said . 
&quot; offshore players suddenly came in and pushed the rupiah up with minimal opposition from local operators , &quot; one U.S. bank dealer said . 
but the rupiah is oversold . 
Fund managers have been looking for good entry levels to lock in the high yields , &quot; he said . 
dealers said it could also be a response to the central bank rate hike in bilateral certificates . 
Bank Indonesia said on Tuesday it has raised the rates for bilateral central bank certificates ( SBIs ) of maturities between one-week and three-months . 
the bank said one-week bilateral SBIs rose to 20 percent from 10.5 , two to 22 percent from 11 percent , one-month to 30 percent from 11.625 and three to 28 percent from 11.5 percent . 
it kept overnight SBIs at 15.0 percent , two-to-six day at 16.0 six-month and one-year at 12.125 and 12.75 percent . 
currency dealers said the move was aimed at containing local speculative dollar buying . 
they said much of the currency volatility stemmed from locals because many corporates were trying to hedge their open dollar positions . 
&quot; If they stay calm , we could see a faster turnaround , &quot; one said , adding that the swap market remained expensive .
