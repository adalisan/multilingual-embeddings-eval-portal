Mike Tyson , once boxing &apos;s most feared fighter , was banned from the sport Wednesday and fined $ 3 million for biting opponent Evander Holyfield &apos;s ears during a bout last month that shocked fans around the world . 
the former heavyweight champion , whose June 28 bid to reclaim his title ended in disgrace , was not present when the five-member Nevada State Athletic Commission voted unanimously to impose the maximum punishment and revoke his license to box , effectively banning him from boxing in the United States . 
Tyson , who once dominated the sport , can apply for reinstatement in one year but if his application for a new license is denied he must wait another year to try again . 
the revocation could constitute a lifetime ban . 
Tyson &apos;s lawyer , Oscar Goodman , tried to put a positive spin on the decision , which could end the controversial career of the 31-year-old fighter . 
&quot; Next year is another year . 
this gives him the opportunity to come back . 
he &apos;s still going to be young , he &apos;s still going to be strong , &quot; said Goodman . 
asked if he had advised his client not to attend the hearing , Goodman said : &quot; Absolutely . 
why should he be subjected to this ? 
in the title bout , Tyson twice bit champion Holyfield &apos;s ears , taking off a portion of his top right ear in the third round before he was disqualified . 
Tyson at first claimed he was retaliating for being cut by a head butt , but later apologized and admitted he had &quot; snapped &quot; and vowed to seek psychological counseling . 
Nevada Deputy Attorney General Gordon Fink was in no mood to accept an apology and told the commission before its ruling : &quot; The events of June 28 demand the maximum penalty ... suspension is a mere interruption . 
&quot; There is a fine line between sports and chaos and what happened on June 28 went beyond that . 
Holyfield &apos;s lawyer , Jim Thomas , told the hearing that while the champion accepted Tyson &apos;s personal apology , &quot; The eyes of the world are on this commission . 
no boxer is bigger than the sport of boxing . 
Tyson &apos;s lawyers appealed for leniency , asking the commission to &quot; do the right thing &quot; and not be swayed by a public outcry that was demanding the boxer &apos;s banishment . 
&quot; Mr. Tyson wanted to make this short and sweet and throw himself on your mercy without any legal remedies , &quot; said Tyson attorney Goodman , who described his client as having been &quot; a gentleman in the ring &quot; throughout his 13-year career . 
the commission heard the arguments and with hardly any discussion voted to revoke his license and fine him 10 percent of his $ 30 million purse . 
afterwards commission chairman Elias Ghanem said : &quot; I think what we did was the right thing . 
we wanted to send a message that we will not tolerate this kind of behavior in Nevada . 
under new federal laws , a suspension in Nevada effectively bars Tyson from fighting anywhere in the United States . 
the law does not force other states to honor a Nevada ban , but those states would have to justify in writing allowing him to fight . 
Tyson &apos;s career has already been shortened by the three years he spent in jail after being convicted of raping a 19-year-old beauty queen .
