American anti-abortion activists seized the spotlight before Hong Kong &apos;s handover on Monday to denounce Beijing &apos;s draconian family planning policy and got into a screaming match with China &apos;s local supporters . 
the anti-abortionists demonstrated on Monday outside the venue where Britain will give the colony back to Beijing . 
&quot; This is not a day of celebration , this is a day of grieving , &quot; shouted Randall Terry , founder of the controversial Operation Rescue group in the United States . 
he decried Hong Kong &apos;s handover to what he described as history &apos;s &quot; bloodiest regime &quot; . 
Terry also plans to demonstrate on Tuesday outside Hong Kong &apos;s Legislative Council where he says he will pray for the collapse of the Chinese communist government . 
holding up a two metre ( six foot ) photograph of the decapitated head of an aborted female foetus outside the Hong Kong Convention Centre , the midnight handover venue , Terry and his group of 11 U.S. Christian ministers blasted Beijing &apos;s one-child policy . 
the centre is where Britain &apos;s Prince Charles and China &apos;s President Jiang Zemin will preside over the British colony &apos;s transfer to Beijing rule at midnight ( 1600 GMT ) on Monday . 
&quot; This is the fruit of Deng Xiaoping , &quot; he said , criticising the late Chinese leader who is credited with China &apos;s economic revival and Hong Kong &apos;s handover . 
&quot; He is the one who initiated the one-child policy . 
he is a murderer who is rotting in hell . 
Terry &apos;s claims enraged Bernard Wijedoru , a Hong Kong District Affairs Adviser to Beijing and a 20-year-long resident of the territory who said he was walking by after picking up his invitation to one of the day &apos;s many festivities . 
&quot; Why do you come here ? 
what right do you have ? 
this is an important event for Hong Kong , the day colonialism is ending , &quot; Wijedoru shouted back at Terry . 
&quot; You are a bloody coolie who wants to break up China . 
Terry in turn accused Wijedoru of taking blood money and prophesied that God would bring down China &apos;s communist government . 
Wijedoru &apos;s words also enraged a passing Hong Kong Chinese man who accused the ethnic-Sri Lankan of having no right to talk about Chinese , but he agreed Hong Kong should go back to China . 
&quot; This is a day to be happy , but we want freedom , &quot; said the man , who gave his name as ling . 
&quot; We don &apos;t want Chinese people to be living in difficulties . 
the heated exchanges captured much of the ambivalence around Hong Kong &apos;s return to China after 156 years of British rule . 
Beijing has promised Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy after the handover and be allowed to keep its own social and economic system for 50 years . 
but doubts linger about how the policy of &quot; one country , two systems &quot; will really work . 
Wijedoru said Hong Kong &apos;s future was inextricably tied to China &apos;s future prosperity and stability . 
Terry and his ministers said godless communists would inevitably impose their system on Hong Kong . 
no local ministers joined their protest , and Terry said that was deliberate . 
&quot; We don &apos;t want to jeopardise anybody here , &quot; he said . 
&quot; sooner or later the Chinese are going to oppress .
