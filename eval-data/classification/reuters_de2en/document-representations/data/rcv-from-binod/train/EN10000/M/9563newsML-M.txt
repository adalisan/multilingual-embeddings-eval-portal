the dollar closed moderately weaker against the mark after an early rally fueled by a surprisingly generous German repo rate cut fizzled , dealers said . 
the Bundesbank , back from summer break , slashed the repo rate 30 basis points to 3.00 percent . 
the move jolted many market players who had expected a more modest reduction . 
&quot; The market had really reined in its expectations to something in the range of a five to 10 basis point adjustment by the Bundesbank , &quot; said Dennis Pettit , foreign exchange manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan . 
&quot; To get 30 basis points on the repo was I guess a pleasant surprise for people that were ( positioned ) the right way , &quot; Pettit added . 
after the Bundesbank announced the rate cut , the dollar jumped sharply and continued climbing to 1.4964 marks , its highest level in five weeks . 
however , the rally ran out of steam as some investors took advantage of the move higher by selling the U.S. currency and booking profits . 
&quot; It moved a good strong pfennig , &quot; said Diego Giurleo , vice president of the Treasury at Royal Bank of Canada . 
&quot; They bought the dollar , ( but it ) lost momentum above 1.4950 . 
traders noted that there was talk of good dollar offers just above 1.4950 marks , while they saw solid support amid rumors of buying interest just below 1.4900 . 
the dollar closed at 1.4919 / 26 marks , down from 1.4940 / 45 at the open . 
it fell to 108.24 / 34 yen from 108.70 / 73 . 
Buba President Hans Tietmeyer said a slowdown in German money supply growth and low inflation had allowed the central bank to cut its main money market rate . 
other European central banks also slashed rates on the heels of the German rate cut including banks in France , Austria , Belgium and the Netherlands . 
the Swiss National Bank left its discount rate unchanged but pumped liquidity into the Swiss money market to relieve upward pressure on money market rates . 
while currency traders applauded the repo rate cut on Thursday , concern about where German interest rates are headed from here may have limited early dollar gains against the mark . 
&quot; I &apos;m just surprised that it didn &apos;t move over 1.50 ( marks ) because that &apos;s a very strong move by the Bundesbank , &quot; said Tom Benfer , director , foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal . 
&quot; I think the market is now trying to grapple with the notion -- is this the last move of the Bundesbank or could there be further cuts in the future , &quot; Benfer asked . 
in other trade , the dollar finished at 1.2074 / 81 Swiss francs , down slightly from 1.2080 / 90 at the open . 
the Australian dollar closed at $ 0.7910 / 15 .
