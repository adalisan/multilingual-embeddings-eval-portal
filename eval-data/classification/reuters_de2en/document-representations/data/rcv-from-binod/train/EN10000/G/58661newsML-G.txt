President Bill Clinton on Tuesday ordered 3,500 U.S. troops to Kuwait as part of a plan to &quot; keep Saddam Hussein in a box , &quot; but failed to silence Republican criticism of his effort to deter Iraq . 
Clinton , trying to manage a tricky foreign policy challenge in the midst of the presidential election campaign , briefed congressional leaders on his Gulf strategy before starting a four-day political trip to the Midwest and West . 
Defense Secretary William Perry , just back from a trip to the Middle East to rally support for the president &apos;s plan , also took part in the 90-minute briefing , as did Secretary of State Warren Christopher and General John Shalikashvili , chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff . 
speaking with reporters afterwards , Clinton disputed a Washington Post report that he was having second thoughts about reinforcing U.S. ground forces in Kuwait because a showdown with Saddam , Iraq &apos;s president , was easing . 
&quot; I authorized the deployment last weekend and ... the deployment orders were signed last night , &quot; Clinton said in denying that plans to send the troops had been put on hold . 
&quot; I was surprised when I read the story today ( about possible suspension of the troop deployment ) and I asked for an explanation of it and none of our people had one because I asked for the deployment last weekend and , as I said , the orders were signed last night , &quot; Clinton said . 
he did not say when the troops might actually go . 
they would join 1,500 U.S. soldiers already in Kuwait , one of the world &apos;s largest oil exporters . 
it was overrun by Iraqi troops in 1990 , an invasion triggered the 1991 Gulf War . 
at the Pentagon , an official said the deployment would occur in a matter of days . 
&quot; The order has been received , and it will be 3,500 troops . 
I expect they will go in the coming days &quot; , said the official , who asked not to be identified . 
the Pentagon announced last Friday that 5,000 armored troops from the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood , Texas , would go to Kuwait , but the movement was held up until Kuwait gave permission for them to be sent . 
the defense official said that the deployment had been reduced from 5,000 to 3,500 because &quot; we decided that is the number we needed . 
Clinton defended his ordering of cruise missile strikes against air defense facilities in southern Iraq two weeks ago in retaliation for an Iraqi move against Kurds in the north . 
he said the attacks -- and the accompanying expansion of a no-fly zone in southern Iraq from which Iraqi warplanes are excluded -- were designed to improve the U.S. strategic position in the Gulf and &quot; keep Saddam Hussein in a box and limit his ability to threaten his neighbors . 
Clinton said that hitting Iraqi Republican Guard troops in northern Iraq , as some of his critics have urged , would have been inappropriate , since they were allied with one of the factions involved in Kurdish infighting . 
referring indirectly to the possibility that such a move might have resulted in American casualties , Clinton said the course his critics proposed would have &quot; a very high price . 
&quot; We did the appropriate thing in the appropriate way and we &apos;ve gotten the results that we sought , &quot; Clinton said . 
but Sen. John McCain , a former Navy flier who spent more than six years in a North Vietnamese prisoner of war camp during the Vietnam War , rejected Clinton &apos;s argument . 
&quot; Saddam Hussein is far better off than he was two weeks ago . 
he now controls parts of northern Iraq he didn &apos;t ( control ) since 1991 , and he has either split or revealed significant splits withiin the ( Gulf War ) coalition , which can do nothing but help him in the long run , &quot; said McCain , an Arizona Republican . 
Senate Republican leader Trent Lott was also critical . 
&quot; I think there has been some neglect and ambiguity here over the past few weeks and months and that &apos;s not the way you can deal with a dictator in Iraq , &quot; said Lott , from Mississippi . 
despite the beefing up of U.S. ground forces in Kuwait , a senior White House official said Iraq &apos;s response to a set of U.S. demands made through diplomatic channels last week was &quot; encouraging , &quot; and that chances of new U.S. military action were diminishing . 
but Senator Joseph Lieberman , among a group of lawmakers briefed by Clinton and his top aides on Tuesday , said Clinton was quite explicit that if Iraq defies the U.S. demands &quot; they can expect to be hit again and hit disproportionately .
