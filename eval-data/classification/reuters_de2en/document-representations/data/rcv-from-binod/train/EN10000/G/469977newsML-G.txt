exhibiting the work of young and upcoming artists &apos; in a large prefab hall is a formula which has had enormous success in Paris , where the Grand Marche d &apos;Art Contemporain ( GMAC ) market attracts 40,000 visitors a week . 
now the French organisers are to test the water in Brussels , with a first modern art market at Place du Marche aux Poissons behind the Saint Catherine Church . 
local Belgian artists are hesitant about the new formula -- only 10 of the 200 artists whose work is shown in the large hall that fills the former fish market square are Belgian . 
most are French , with some English , German and African artists . 
&quot; This is a good market , nice audience , not as snooty as in Paris . 
Belgians have art in their blood , &quot; said Jacques van der Vaeren , a Belgian artist living in Paris who has exhibited in the Paris art markets . 
each artist has a small stand , showing a variety of works -- mostly paintings , but also sculpture and ceramics -- ranging in price from 10,000 to 100,000 francs . 
none of those exhibiting has museum status , but many of the pieces are excellent . 
&quot; This is an extremely useful formula . 
it &apos;s a way of seeing a lot of artists in a short time , &quot; said Martin Vaughn-James , a Brussels-based British artist . 
most of the artists are on site for the full six days of the market . 
Fabienne Vaerewyck , one of the organisers , said that the artists &apos; presence was one of the market &apos;s main attractions . 
&quot; People can have direct contact with the artist , which is not often possible in a gallery . 
in Paris , there are three markets a year , on Place de la Bastille and Quai Henri IV . 
a second modern art market in Brussels is planned for December . 
practical : the Modern Art Market is open daily from 1100 to 2000 from March 26-31 . 
Vernissage and professional visits are on Wednesday , March 26 from 1800-2200 . 
on Friday , March 28 there is a nocturne until 2200 . 
entry ( at BEF 150 ) is right behind St Catherine Church , close to the St. Catherine subway stop .
