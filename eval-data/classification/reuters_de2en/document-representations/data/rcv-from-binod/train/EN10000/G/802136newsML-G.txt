Mexico &apos;s defense minister declined to meet with a U.N. envoy investigating allegations of torture for a special report likely to be critical of Mexico , the envoy said on Friday . 
Nigel Rodley , the U.N. envoy , told a news conference he probed numerous allegations of torture , many of which were directed at the army &apos;s strong-arm methods in combatting guerrillas . 
he was set to conclude his 10-day visit on Saturday . 
&quot; You can draw your own conclusions from the fact that I did meet the minister of the interior , I did meet the minister of foreign relations , I did meet the attorney general of the republic and I didn &apos;t meet the secretary of defense , &quot; Rodley said in resonse to a question on whether the army was cooperative . 
Rodley did not say why Gen. Enrique Cervantes Aguirre declined his interview request . 
a defense ministry spokesman said he had no comment on the matter . 
although Rodley refused to reveal his conclusions from the fact-finding mission , he dropped several strong hints that his report due early next year would be less than favorable . 
&quot; I have received a lot of testimony from a number of quarters of very sad things happening , &quot; said Rodley , a professor of international relations and human rights at Britain &apos;s Essex University . 
&quot; We &apos;ve all been subject to a lot of emotional pressure in listening to it . 
Mexico was chosen for closer examination because recent annual human rights reports showed more than just &quot; isolated &quot; complaints of torture , Rodley said . 
Rodley said he spent most of his time in Mexico City interviewing officials from the government and non-governmental organizations , but he also visited rural Guerrero state , the site of recent guerrilla violence as well as allegations of torture by the army combatting those rebels . 
&quot; I was aware that the problem in Guerrero was relatively new in the wake of the ( 1995 ) Aguas Blancas massacre ( in which police killed 17 peasants ) , &quot; Rodley said . 
&quot; If I chose to go to Guerrero , it was not because I &apos;d been receiving a lot of complaints about the Judicial Police in that state , &quot; he said in answer to a question on whether he was investigating the army there . 
Rodley said although he failed to meet Gen. Cervantes , he did interview the chief of the army judicial system . 
&quot; I did have a meeting with the military prosecutor general , and he gave me information about how the military justice system is supposed to work , &quot; Rodley said .
