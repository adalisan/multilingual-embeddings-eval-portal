cigarettes that don &apos;t produce smoke , solar cookers for refugees and buttons that need no sewing were among a thousand new devices that went on display this week at Geneva &apos;s inventions exhibition , the inventors &apos; equivalent of the Olympics . 
among the most catchy ones were , from Russia , spectacles with acoustic sensors for people with sight deficiency , from Switzerland a skateboard with a shopping bag and brakes for housewives and , from the Netherlands , a device to enable women to urinate like men . 
the highlight of this year &apos;s exhibition was the stand of a team of Russian rocket scientists , engineers and retired army officers from Moscow &apos;s crumbling defence industry , now hoping to join in the post-Soviet money-making frenzy . 
a new night-vision device , an open helicopter designed for invalids , a &quot; hydrobike &quot; with sails , a stain-removing &quot; dry cleaning stick &quot; made with rocket fuel technology and a new aircraft that could help Russia &apos;s chaotic Aeroflot airline to overload even more -- they could have only come from Russia . 
&quot; It was better in the old days , &quot; lamented Russian ex-army officer and military engineer Valery Solovyov , inventor of the aircraft which has increased cargo capacity thanks to larger wings . 
&quot; We had more inventors before . 
now everything costs money -- patents , registration . 
too much for a pensioner like me . 
he added : &quot; I tried to sell my idea to our Tupolov aircraft manucaturers . 
they said they have no money . 
they didn &apos;t even reply . 
nearby , Russian engineer Grigory Bushmarinov was busy taking questions from an elderly Swiss lady interested in a necklace with a crystal pendant that changes color when the sun &apos;s ultraviolet rays are dangerous -- made by a factory producing rocket parts for the Russian military industrial complex . 
&quot; We came here to talk business . 
but all these people are like tourists . 
this type of exhibition should be more specialised and technical , &quot; he later complained to Reuters . 
across his stand , the All-Russia Research Institute for Medical Technologies was offering a &quot; biocorrector &quot; with a scanner promising to restore health with resonating sound frequencies . 
Mikhail Tatischev , deputy chairman of the commercial company Binar which is marketing the device , said : &quot; This technology was top secret in Soviet times . 
now it &apos;s good business . 
in the crowd of more than 600 scientists , boffins , engineers and wacky inventors from 44 countries , one of the most scary ideas was from a German who invented a metal device to insert into a pregnant woman &apos;s body to help deliver her baby more easily . 
with a rubber tube and a jumble of bolts and safety valves , the &quot; Happy Birthday &quot; instrument for obstetricians looked straight out of an antiquated science-fiction movie . 
its creator , Michael Belinek from Bayern , said the device had not been tested on humans yet but offered the assurance : &quot; It &apos;s not dangerous . 
the tube moves inside a woman &apos;s body , right into the channel of birth , and contacts the baby and delivers it quickly . 
it is not exactly a vacuum method . 
it took me 10 years . 
other inventions at the exhibition , which organisers hope will generate new business worth 40 million Swiss francs , were more user-friendly . 
French ideas included an anti-snoring device and a button which is stuck , not sewed , to garments and could revolutionise the textile industry , while the Swiss had new designs for skiers and skaters and hygiene products such as an automatic toilet seat protector . 
a huge crowd of smokers gathered around Gabriel Van der Elst from Belgium to test his new &quot; smokeless &quot; cigarette -- a filterlike device attached to the cigarette which makes it last twice as long and stops the smoke from coming out . 
&quot; My mother always made me smoke outside the house and drove me mad , &quot; he said . 
&quot; With this , I can smoke my one and a half packs a day without disturbing anyone .
