a large explosion was heard in central Belfast early on Monday amid Catholic violence to protest against the holding of a Protestant Orange Order parade on Sunday . 
residents said the blast was heard , apparently from the northwest part of the Northern Ireland capital . 
police said they had no details of any explosion but were checking . 
the explosion echoed around the city centre shortly after midnight amid violent scenes in Catholic Irish nationalist parts of the city over the holding of the parade . 
cars were hijacked and set on fire and the Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility in a statement to a news organisation for the shooting on Sunday of a policewoman in a police vehicle . 
she was hospitalised with facial injuries . 
the IRA , which enjoys support among some section of the 40 per cent Catholic minority , is fighting a 28-year war to end British rule of Northern Ireland .
