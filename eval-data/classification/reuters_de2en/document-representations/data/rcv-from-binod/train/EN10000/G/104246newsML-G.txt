Belgium , hoping for a rush of goals against soccer lightweights San Marino , had to settle for a 3-0 World Cup qualifying victory against unexpectedly stubborn opponents on Wednesday . 
the win sent Belgium level on six points with Wales at the top of European group seven but behind on goal difference . 
Wales , who have played San Marino twice already , scored a total of 11 goals against the part-timers . 
Belgium , who battled to beat Turkey 2-1 at the opening of their World Cup campaign , had hoped to put a string of lacklustre performances behind them but San Marino goalkeeper Federico Gasperoni kept his side in the match . 
Gert Verheyen opened the scoring in the 10th minute , followed by Luc Nilis 10 minutes later . 
Nilis found the net again in the 46th minute before San Marino clamped down on a team that included fiorentina &apos;s powerful Brazilian born striker Luis Oliveira . 
San Marino &apos;s few supporters , whose side has yet to score a goal in the qualifying campaign for the 1988 World Cup in France , could at least comfort themselves with a respectable scoreline -- their lowest for many a day .
