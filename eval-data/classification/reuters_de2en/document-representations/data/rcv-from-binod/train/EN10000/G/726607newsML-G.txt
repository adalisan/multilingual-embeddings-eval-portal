security Council members said Monday they were pleased that talks between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders had been held in a &quot; positive and constructive atmosphere &quot; and called for further progress at the next round , expected in August . 
the comments were made in a statement issued by Council president Peter Osvald of Sweden after a closed-door briefing by Secretary-General Kofi Annan &apos;s special adviser on Cyprus , Diego Cordovez . 
the former Ecuadorean Foreign Minister led four days of talks between President Glafcos Clerides , who is also head of the Greek Cypriot community , and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash . 
the talks at a secluded rural retreat called Troutbeck , 90 miles ( 145 km ) north of New York , ended on Saturday . 
&quot; The Security Council welcomes the completion of the first round of direct talks between the leaders of the two Cypriot communities , under the aegis of the secretary-general . 
the council is very pleased to learn Tha these talks were held in a positive and constructive atmosphere , &quot; the statement said . 
&quot; Security Council members urge the leaders of the two communities to uphold a sustained process of direct negotiations until the instruments that will constitute a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue have been concluded . 
they also urged the two parties to &quot; respond constructively to the suggestions made by the secretary-general &apos;s special adviser on Cyprus so that further progress can be made at the next round of talks , &quot; the statement added , reiterating the council &apos;s full support for Annan &apos;s efforts . 
last week &apos;s meetings , held under a tight news blackout , were aimed at starting a process leading to the reuniting of the divided island as a bi-zonal , bi-communal federation . 
a new round is expected in Switzerland Aug . 11-16 , though this has not been confirmed . 
Cyprus has been partitioned since troops from Turkey took over more than a third of the island in 1974 in reaction to a brief coup in Nicosia engineered by the military junta then ruling Greece .
