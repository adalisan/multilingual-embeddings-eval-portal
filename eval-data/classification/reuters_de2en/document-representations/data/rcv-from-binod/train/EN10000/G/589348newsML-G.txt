frank Castillo got his first win in over three weeks and Chicago tripled three times in a four-run seventh inning as the Cubs posted an 8-2 victory over the San Diego Padres Thursday . 
Castillo ( 2-5 ) , whose only other win came on April 21 , scattered three hits over seven innings and gave up both runs and three walks with a season-high eight strikeouts . 
the right-hander had allowed 10 earned runs and 19 hits over his last three outings , spanning 11 1 / 3 innings . 
&quot; Today I was able to get my fastball over for a strike , &quot; said Castillo . 
&quot; That &apos;s a key for me . 
when I &apos;m able to locate my fastball , then my changeup is even more effective than usual . 
Bob Patterson and Kent Bottenfield each worked a perfect inning for the Cubs , who had lost three of their last four but have captured four of their last five at Wrigley Field . 
&quot; We got good starting pitching from Frank and the bats came alive and put the game away for us , &quot; said Cubs manager Jim Riggleman . 
&quot; This is what we expect out of the Chicago Cubs , we have to go out and be more consistent . 
the Cubs extended a 3-2 lead in the seventh when Tim Scott began the inning for starter Sterling Hitchcock ( 3-4 ) . 
Brian McRae and Doug Glanville hit back-to-back one-out triples , Mark Grace had a run-scoring single and Sammy Sosa tripled in Grace for a 7-2 lead . 
Chicago tripled three times in an inning for the first time since Steve Henderson , Leon Durham and Jerry Morales did it consecutively on April 25 , 1981 . 
Jose Hernandez also tripled in the fourth for Cubs . 
Wally Joyner homered for the Padres , who have dropped three straight , five of seven , and nine of their last 10 on the road . 
in Cincinnati , Ismael Valdes combined with three relievers on a five-hitter for his first win in six weeks and Todd Zeile and Billy Ashley had RBI singles as the Los Angeles dodgers handed the reds their fifth straight loss , 2-1 . 
Valdes ( 2-4 ) allowed one run and three hits over seven innings with two walks and five strikeouts . 
he snapped a personal four-game losing streak and won for the first time since his first start of the season on April 3 . 
Valdes &apos;s 2.12 ERA is 10th in the National League , but the dodgers have combined for only 17 runs in his eight starts . 
&quot; I was hitting the corners , making some good pitches against tough guys who can change the game with one swing . 
mark Guthrie and Darren Hall combined to pitch the eighth and Todd Worrell gave up a hit and a walk in the ninth for his 12th save . 
&quot; We got just enough , &quot; said dodgers manager Bill Russell , whose team has won 11 of its last 15 games . 
&quot; The guys aren &apos;t hitting yet . 
we &apos;re winning and that eases things . 
one day we &apos;ll break out . 
&quot; Valdes had good stuff , he had a good fastball , you could see that in the fourth inning . 
he made some good pitches . 
the five-game skid is the third of the season for the reds , who fell into last place in the National League Central , one game behind the Cubs . 
Cincinnati has dropped 21 of its last 27 games and seven in a row at home . 
John smiley ( 3-6 ) took the loss . 
in Montreal , Rondell White &apos;s two-run single in the bottom of the eighth snapped a tie and Anthony Telford earned his first win in seven seasons as the Expos won their fourth straight game , defeating the San Francisco giants 8-7 .
