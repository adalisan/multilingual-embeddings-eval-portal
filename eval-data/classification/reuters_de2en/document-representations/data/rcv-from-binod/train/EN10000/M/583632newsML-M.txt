U.S. treasuries edged up in London amid little activity on Wednesday awaiting what was expected to be weak U.S. April producer price data later in the session , analysts said . 
&quot; It has been fairly quiet so far , &quot; said a treasuries trader at a U.S. bank in London . 
&quot; There has been nothing much in the back end , it has really been in the belly of the curve with interest in fives and tens . 
the 30-year long bond was at 96-11 to yield 6.914 percent by 1015 GMT , compared with 96-08 in Tokyo and 96-07 in New York . 
at the shorter end of the curve two-year T-notes were at 100-06 , unchanged from Tokyo and up from 100-05 in New York , while five-year notes were at 100-11 , up from 100-08 in Tokyo and 100-07 at the New York close . 
the trader said the five-year sector had seen swap buying and also Japanese investor interest . 
the trader said the market was anticipating weak data . 
expectations were for the headline figure to be unchanged , compared with a 0.1 percent fall in March . 
excluding food and energy , prices were forecast to rise 0.1 percent , versus 0.4 percent previously . 
they were expected to rise 0.3 percent , unchanged from February . 
on Tuesday , treasuries pushed lower in New York amid comments from the Richmond Fed Chairman Alfred Broaddus that the risk to the U.S. economy was still to the upside . 
an unidentified Federal Reserve source also said in a Reuters interview said there was a good chance the Fed may raise rates a further 25 basis points at its May meeting . 
the Federal Open Market Committee is due to meet on May 20 . 
David Hewitt , bond strategist at Tokyo Mitsubishi International in London , said he was expecting the Fed to raise rates and that the market was due for a correction . 
&quot; It has had quite a strong rally and is still three points above the low in April , &quot; he said , adding that ahead of a rate increase the curve was still fairly flat in the five- and ten-year area . 
&quot; It has been steepening but is still below average so there is probably a bit further to go . 
all round the market is going to trade down with the long end falling a little bit further , &quot; Hewitt said . 
he said this week &apos;s data had been favourable to treasuries but the market was still trending down . 
&quot; It is looking a bit tired .
