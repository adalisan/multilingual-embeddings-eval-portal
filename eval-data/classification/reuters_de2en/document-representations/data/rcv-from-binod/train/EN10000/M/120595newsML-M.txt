U.S. refiners were sidelined in the foreign crude market finding imports scarce because of expensive Brent-related crudes and freight economics . 
a narrow West Texas Intermediate / Brent spread continued to shut out arbitrage opportunities for Brent-related North Sea and West African grades , lending support to domestic Gulf Coast Louisiana grades , traders said . 
information about Brent cargoes moved into the U.S. Gulf this week remained elusive , with alleged buyers denying rumors of pricey trades done at Dec WTI plus 50-55 cents . 
three buyers were rumored to have taken a VLCC , some two million barrels worth of Brent from one European trader . 
in the London market , one Brent for Oct 29-31 was reported done at Dec IPE plus 65 cents . 
it was sold by the European trader who had been expected to fix a ULCC for the U.S. 
a second Brent was reported later in the U.S. session for Oct 25-27 at Nov Brent plus six cents , slightly firmer than the first trade said equivalent to Nov plus 4 cents . 
regional light grades included Cusiana , reported sold to one Midwest refiner this week at Jan WTI plus 35 cents fob , in addition to another for late Nov at Dec WTI plus 10 cents fob . 
traders reported no active offers for West African barrels to the U.S. , currently highly sought for in Europe and Asia . 
in the U.S. after-market , Brent intermonth Nov / Dec paper traded once at 48 cents in extremely thin conditions , off about five cents from London &apos;s intraday range .
