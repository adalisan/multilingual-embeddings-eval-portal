Gauteng Lions were dealt a potentially fatal blow in their bid to reaching the Super 12 semifinals when they sank to a 40-27 defeat against Queensland on Saturday . 
the Lions surrendered five tries to a resurgent Queensland at Ballymore in a match the South Africans had to win to maintain any realistic hope of finishing in the top four in the standings . 
the defeat means compatriots Natal will join Auckland , Australian Capital Territory and Wellington in the semifinals later this month if they beat Northern Transvaal at home on Sunday . 
if they lose , Gauteng must still beat Natal at home next weekend and hope results elsewhere go their way to sneak into the semifinals . 
Queensland , who led 25-10 at halftime , lifted themselves into mid-table after a dreadful start to the season with their third win in a row . 
prop Scott Webster , centres Jason Little and Daniel Herbert , winger Damian Smith and full-back Tim Horan scored the tries in a low-key and mistake-ridden match . 
lock John Eales added 15 points by kicking three conversions and three penalties . 
an inexperienced Gauteng outfit , weakened by injuries to a host of top players , replied with four tries of their own to claim a competition bonus point . 
Hooker Chris Rossouw crossed the line twice with further scores from scrum-half Jopie Adlam and number eight Warren Brosnihan . 
with so much at stake , the Lions gave a determined , spirited performance but much of their effort was wasted because of handling mistakes and indiscipline . 
teams : 
Queensland - Tim Horan ( captain ) ; Damian Smith , Daniel Herbert , Jason Little , Ben tune ; Elton Flatley , Brett Johnstone ; Mark Connors , Mark Murray , Toutai Kefu , Matt Cockbain , John Eales , Glen Panaho , Christiaan Knapp , Scott Webster .
