Vietnam &apos;s Communist Party leaders have stepped up their war of words against the scourge of corruption and slammed the loss of revolutionary fervour within party ranks , official media reports said on Thursday . 
Party Secretary General Do Muoi , speaking at a conference on internal security , warned that moral degeneration among party cadres had opened a flank for enemies to sabotage the revolution . 
the party daily , Nhan Dan , quoted Muoi as saying that decadence in official circles had &quot; dented popular confidence in the party and become a loophole for the enemy to sabotage the revolution and distort the reputation of party and state &quot; . 
Muoi &apos;s rail against graft was echoed by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet , a fellow member of the country &apos;s septuagenarian leadership troika . 
Kiet told the Lao Dong newspaper in an interview that legal measures against corruption should be tightened and said powerful officials who were guilty of corruption should be ousted . 
he said the country needed many people like &quot; Justice Pao &quot; , the hero of a Chinese television series who metes out fair justice to common criminals and corrupt officials alike . 
&quot; Justice Pao &quot; is hugely popular in Vietnam . 
hundreds of thousands tune in to the programme twice a week and video stores do brisk business in renting out past episodes . 
last year a Hong Kong-based consultancy survey named China , Indonesia and Vietnam as Asia &apos;s most graft-ridden nations . 
a recent official newspaper report said 4,900 corruption cases , causing economic losses of over $ 145 million , were uncovered in the first nine months of 1996 alone . 
in a policy document approved at a landmark congress six months ago , the party betrayed unease about the &quot; cult of money &quot; that had been spawned by a decade of capitalist-style reforms and vowed to tackle &quot; declining morality &quot; within the party . 
political analysts say the drive to purge the party of graft is part of efforts to promote public confidence in a body whose control over the country , some leaders fear , is being quietly chipped away by foreign influences and pockets of new wealth . 
the daily Vietnam News said on Thursday that the country &apos;s first legal document aimed at curbing corruption was drafted last month and would be open for public discussion . 
the draft includes a suggestion that any state or military official found guilty of siphoning off 300 million Dong ( $ 27,000 ) or more should go in front of the firing squad or at least be imprisoned for life . 
the public blitz on graft has brought a flood of newspaper reports about several notorious cases . 
after months of raking through the murky details of an embezzlement scandal surrounding a party-affiliated import-export firm , the press is now focusing on the arrest of senior police officers for alleged involvement in a huge heroin-trafficking ring . 
Kiet said the state encouraged press coverage of corruption cases , but warned against subjective and erroneous reporting .
