Prime Minister John Major on Wednesday urged electors in Tatton , the seat of former trade minister Neil Hamilton who is at the centre of a &quot; cash for questions &quot; scandal , to vote for him in the May 1 election . 
Howver he indicated that no senior minister was likely to visit Tatton to back Hamilton &apos;s campaign . 
asked whether , if he was a Tatton elector , he would vote for Hamilton or independent anti-sleaze candidate Martin Bell , Major told a news conference : &quot; I would vote for Neil Hamilton and that is what I invite everybody in Tatton to do . 
asked whether cabinet ministers would go to the north-west England seat to back Hamilton , Major replied : &quot; Cabinet mnisters will be all round the country in this campaign but Tatton is a very safe Conservative seat against a Lib-Lab pact candidate . 
Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine was asked by a journalist whether he was misled by Hamilton when he questioned him some months ago about the allegations against him . 
he did not directly answer the question , saying : &quot; I have given my evidence to ( parliamentary standards commissioner ) Sir Gordon Downey . 
it is his job to evaluate it . 
major strongly defended his refusal to intervene in the Tatton Conservative Associations &apos;s selection of a candidate , saying it was Conservative Party tradition that this matter be left to local members .
