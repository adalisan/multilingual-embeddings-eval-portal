Nigeria and Zimbabwe have topped Britain &apos;s annual list of serious offences committed by diplomats with immunity from prosecution in the courts . 
the government said that out of 34 serious offences committed in Britain by people with diplomatic immunity in 1996 , Nigerian and Zimbabwean diplomats accounted for three each . 
the figures were contained in a written parliamentary answer by Foreign Office minister Baroness Symons , released on Monday . 
Russia , Italy , Saudi Arabia , Uganda and the Commonwealth Secretariat accounted for two each . 
the list -- published annually to shame offenders -- showed six diplomats were withdrawn from Britain after the Foreign Office complained to their embassies about alleged offences . 
two Zimbabwean diplomats left , one for alleged assault and another for drunk driving . 
a Nigerian and a Honduran diplomat departed after alleged fraud , a Jamaican diplomat went after drunk driving charges and a Ugandan went after accusations of breach of the peace - a public order offence . 
but not all was gloom . 
the government said despite the list , diplomats were far more law-abiding than ordinary citizens . 
there were only 18 drink driving cases in the 17,000-strong diplomatic community , compared to 31 for a similar sample of the overall population , and only 10 cases of diplomatic shoplifting compared to 44 in the population at large .
