rouble / dollar midday morning close 
today settlement 5,801-02 5,801-02 5,791-93 
tomorrow settlement 5,799-800 5,800-01 5,899-00 
overnight credits ( % ) 4-8 2-7 8-13 
according to the terms of the Svyazinvest auction , bidders had to deposit $ 400 million to participate . 
losers will receive their money back within three banking days . 
&quot; It is obvious that most people ( bidders ) deposited the funds in hard currency , and the money will not go to the forex market , &quot; said ING Bank dealer Alexander Lomakin . 
&quot; It is logical to suppose that it will be sold for roubles to be channelled into T-bills , while some of the hard currency will be used to buy MinFin bonds . 
Russian officials said on Friday Cyprus-registered group Mustcom , set up by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell , Russian investment bank Renaissance Capital and others , won the Svyazinvest stake for $ 1.875 billion . 
overnight credits fell sharply as fresh funds from the T-bill market returned to the market . 
the rouble slipped until it hit a resistance level of 5,802 per dollar . 
&quot; overnight roubles were practically free today , that is why roubles with today and tomorrow settlements opened at the same level , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; Later , people started buying the dollar , but at 5,802 , level sellers appeared .
