UK shares are expected to challenge the 4,700 level on Wednesday as Wall Street &apos;s record close encourages institutional players to invest some of their substantial cash holdings . 
nervous bond markets are likely to keep a cap on the FTSE &apos;s advance but another strong performance by the Dow later today could push the UK share market into record territory on Thursday , dealers said . 
&quot; The momentum is building for another push on 4,700 . 
if we close above that today and the U.S. does well , we should test the ( FTSE 100 &apos;s intraday ) highs tomorrow , &quot; one senior dealer said . 
a surge in high-technology shares drove both the Dow and Nasdaq to record levels on Tuesday . 
the Dow Industrials average rose 37.50 points to close at 7,383.41 while the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index ended 19.49 points firmer to 1,409.21 . 
the major near-term worry for share markets on both sides of the Atlantic continues to be rising bond yields , dealers said . 
U.S. treasuries were slightly easier in Tokyo on Wednesday with the yield on the benchmark 30-year long bond rising to 7.04 percent by 0645 GMT from 7.02 percent in New York . 
&quot; The bonds are still a bit of a worry for this market , &quot; the head of trading at a large brokerage said . 
&quot; The last time they crept above the seven percent mark we had a big sell-off on Wall Street . 
the bonds may be telling us that the Dow is near another peak and needs to cool down a bit . 
the Dow began a 700-point downward spiral in mid-March , when the yield on the long bond stayed above the seven percent level , briefly touching 7.20 percent . 
the revival in U.S. blue chips in mid-April coincided with falling bond yields . 
Anglian Water plc leads a flood of water companies reporting results this week , announcing full-year pre-tax , pre-exceptional profits of 257 million stg . 
the company also said it had agreed to acquire Hartlepool Water plc for 19.5 million stg in cash . 
meanwhile , Kingfisher plc said like-for-like retail sales rose by eight percent in the 13 weeks to May 3 , while Allders plc reported like-for-like sales jumped 7.2 percent in the seven weeks to May 17 . 
Allders , which also reported first-half pre-tax profits of 16.0 million stg from 8.0 million a year ago warned , however , that it was unlikely to maintain the high rate of sales growth . 
elsewhere , Thorn plc reported full-year pre-tax profits of 171 million stg . 
no major UK economic statistics are due for release on Wednesday . 
in the U.S. , durable goods orders are due for release at 1230 GMT .
