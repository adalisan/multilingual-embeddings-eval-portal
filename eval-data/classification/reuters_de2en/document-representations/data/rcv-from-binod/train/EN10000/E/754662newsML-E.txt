following is a translation by Reuters of the full text of the Bundesbank &apos;s statement on the money supply on Wednesday : 
&quot; The central council of the Deutsche Bundesbank examined the money supply orientation for 1997 / 1998 and its money supply target for 1997 at its meeting today which was attended by the state secretary to the Federal Economics Ministry , Mr Klaus Buenger . 
it reached the following decision : 
&quot; The Deutsche Bundesbank is maintaining the money supply orientation it decided on in December 1996 which envisages an expansion of the M3 money supply by about five percent from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1998 . 
the additionally set target corridor of 3.5 percent to 6.5 percent for 1997 will also be maintained . 
&quot; The target was exceeded up to and including May of this year . 
the main reason for this was a large statistical overhang at the end of 1996 which resulted from high borrowing ahead of modifications to special rules on tax writedowns , especially for rented accommodation in east Germany , and the rise in property purchase tax . 
&quot; The M3 money supply swung into the target corridor in June . 
from today &apos;s point of view the Bundesbank regards a further weakening of the money supply expansion as necessary in terms of stability policy . 
&quot; By deciding to maintain its money supply target the Bundesbank is underlining that it continues to regard the money supply M3 as the central guide for monetary policy . 
the development of the money supply has been subject to strong swings in recent years but the long term fundamental monetary relationships remain sufficiently stable . 
&quot; As in the past , the Deutsche Bundesbank will check signals emanating from the development of the money supply in the context of a broad analysis of all data relevant to prices . 
in doing this it will pay special attention to the external value of the deutschemark and events on the financial markets alongside data from the real sector .
