a bid by 20 members of the U.S. House of Representatives to end the U.S. quota on imported Canadian lumber will not make any headway , a senior Canadian trade official said on Thursday . 
&quot; Canada and the U.S. have a five-year agreement on softwood lumber which still has four years to run , &quot; Charles Larabie , spokesman for Canada &apos;s trade department , said in an interview at a quadrilateral trade conference . 
&quot; We fully expect them to live up to all their oblibations on the agreement , &quot; he said . 
backers of the U.S. bill said it would result in lower housing prices and make it easier for Americans to buy a house . 
the quota system penalizes Canadian lumber producers if they export more than 14.7 billion board feet of lumber a year . 
the first year of the quota saw a steep rise in prices . 
U.S. groups representing home builders , lumber dealers and retailers gave their support to the U.S. bill , saying the quota was &quot; a mistake &quot; that drove up lumber costs . 
but in Toronto , Larabie said higher lumber costs were expected all along as a result of the quota system . 
Canada reluctantly agreed to the quota system after years of bickering with the United States over softwood lumber . 
Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton has said he hoped to revert to a free trade system when the current quota agreement ended . 
for now , Canada and the United States were obliged to continue with the quota , despite complaints from U.S. home builders and some Canadian lumber producers , Larabie said . 
&quot; This is just more static on the radio channel , &quot; he said .
