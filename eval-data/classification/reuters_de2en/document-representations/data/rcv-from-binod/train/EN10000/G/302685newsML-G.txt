three bursts of gunfire shattered the calm on Monday around the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence in Lima where heavily armed Marxist rebels were holding 74 hostages for the 27th day . 
witnesses and policemen said they believed the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) rebels used assault rifles to fire into the air from within the residence after spotting what appeared to be a police helicopter hovering overhead . 
&quot; The helicopter came too close , so they opened fire , &quot; one policeman at the site told Reuters . 
there were no reports of injuries after the shooting , which took place at around 11 : 20 a.m. ( 1620 GMT ) . 
the shots sent birds scattering in panic across the front of the residence and journalists ducking for cover . 
some police crouched in alert positions , weapons at the ready , but most police remained calm and Red Cross official Michel Minnig entered the residence minutes later as calm returned . 
asked as he exited about the reason for the shots , Minnig said : &quot; We are looking into it . 
the rebels have fired gunshots into the air on several previous occasions during the crisis in an apparent effort to attract attention and make their presence felt . 
tentative contacts between the government and the rebels continued on Monday after hopes were dashed on Sunday for a second face-to-face meeting between government negotiator Domingo Palermo and MRTA leader Nestor Cerpa . 
but both sides remained intransigent in their bargaining positions . 
the MRTA announced early on Monday it had a reply to the government &apos;s proposal to set up a &quot; guarantor committee &quot; to oversee talks to end the crisis . 
using its now familiar mode of communication , the rebels placed a sign in an upper window of the residence asking Palermo to allow a local television network to enter the building to enable the MRTA to &quot; make a public reply to the proposal . 
there was no immediate response from the government . 
Palermo made the proposal on Sunday after Cerpa told him in a written note to cancel a planned meeting unless he was prepared to discuss liberating jailed MRTA members . 
the curt message , delivered by Red Cross officials , ended brief hopes of a swift end to the crisis and showed how little the sides had shifted their positions since the siege began on Dec . 17 . 
President Alberto Fujimori has repeatedly ruled out the demand to release MRTA prisoners , dismissing it as &quot; terrorist blackmail . 
&quot; But he has floated the possibility of transporting the rebels to another country if they lay down their arms and release all the remaining captives . 
&quot; My government &apos;s immovable position from the start is that we will not release prisoners . 
why would we free terrorists ? 
we &apos;re negotiating safe passage , and there are various ways to do that , &quot; Fujimori told the weekly U.S. newsmagazine Time in an interview published on Monday . 
Fujimori added that &quot; no one can tell how long this ( crisis ) could go on &quot; and said he could not rule out the use of force on either side . 
he said the presence of his brother , Pedro Fujimori , among the hostages was not affecting his judgment . 
&quot; ( It is ) neither harder nor easier . 
if he weren &apos;t a hostage , my stand would be the same . 
in these circumstances , one should act with a cool head and repress natural emotions . 
he &apos;s my brother , but I have to act as the president . 
Fujimori also reiterated that the crisis was an isolated incident . 
&quot; The crisis could affect tourism , but I think investors know perfectly well what the country &apos;s social and economic situation is . 
they know this doesn &apos;t mean a resurgence of terrorism . 
terrorism is disappearing in Peru ; there are only a few pockets left in the jungle . 
cancellation of the planned face-to-face meeting between Palermo and Cerpa was seen as a major blow by Japanese officials who are concerned about the safety of two dozen Japanese businessmen and diplomats still held captive . 
&quot; The situation remains extremely tough and difficult , allowing no pre-judgment , &quot; Japan &apos;s Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a news conference in Singapore . 
&quot; We hope direct negotiations will be resumed as soon as posssible . 
the rebels initially took about 500 hostages after storming the residence but have released most as &quot; goodwill gestures .
