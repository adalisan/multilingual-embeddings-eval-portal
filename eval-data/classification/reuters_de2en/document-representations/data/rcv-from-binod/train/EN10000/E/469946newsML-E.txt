trade superpowers and developing nations clinched a sweeping $ 500 billion deal on Wednesday to scrap tariffs in information technology products in a big boost to consumers and manufacturers in the booming industry . 
for the average consumer , the deal means cheaper infotech products and personal computers sold in countries from India to Europe , said World Trade Organisation chief Renato Ruggiero . 
hailing the pact as a win-win scenario for computer makers , emerging economies and customers , Ruggiero said it would give a boost to cross-border investment flows and economic growth . 
&quot; This pact is very important for emerging markets in terms of opening up their economies , lowering their barriers and the possibility of buying products at a lower price , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We &apos;re approaching a win-win situation in this sector . 
a total of 39 countries representing 92.5 percent of the world trade in infotech products committed themselves to the pact , which will cut tariffs on computers , telecom products , semiconductors , semiconductor manufacturing equipment , software and CD roms and scientific instruments by the year 2000 . 
analysts said the pact , &quot; as vital as drinking water to compete in the global economy &quot; according to one , opened the way for a vast expansion of the industry and ambitious future deals . 
the deal complements February &apos;s WTO pact to liberalise basic telecoms trade , and together they cover business worth more than $ 1 trillion annually , more than the global trade volumes each in agriculture , cars and textiles sectors , Ruggiero said . 
the two pacts on telecoms and information technology are also a big boost to the credibility of the fledgling WTO . 
&quot; We &apos;re really on a roll , &quot; a smiling Ruggiero told Reuters . 
&quot; For the WTO , this has been a very big step forward . 
first tariff cuts under the deal , shaped in December at a Singapore WTO ministerial meeting , must take place in July . 
Ruggiero said lower tariffs will cut prices for consumers around the world from Asia to Europe . 
Singapore , Hong Kong and Malaysia already have zero duties for most products , Korea has duties of eight percent while the European Union has more duties to scrap than the U.S. and Japan . 
but the biggest winners would be consumers in India where tariffs as high as 52 percent will come down to zero under the pact , Ruggiero said . 
India also stands to gain because it is a major supplier of applications development and maintenance software services to north America and Britain . 
its information technology skills much in demand in north America were also set to benefit . 
trade diplomats said computer giants in the United States , Germany , Japan and South Korea stood to gain from the deal , save tens of millions of dollars and boost overseas earnings . 
one last hurdle was cleared when Washington decided not to hold up a deal over its discontent with EU tariffs on local area network equipment and multimedia personal computers . 
Washington says a reclassification of such products by the EU customs authorities has caused higher duties on its imports in violation of world trade rules and has filed a case against the European Union under the WTO &apos;s Dispute Settlement Body . 
the 39 participants were the world &apos;s four trading powers , the United States , the 15-member European Union , Japan , Canada , as well as Australia , Hong Kong , Iceland , Indonesia , South Korea , Norway , Singapore , Switzerland , Turkey , Costa Rica , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Israel , India , Macau , Malaysia , New Zealand , Romania , the Slovak Republic , Thailand and the Chinese Taipei custom territory -- Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen and Matsu . 
two countries initially on board , Panama and Poland , did not sign up because of delays in finalising their timetables but Ruggiero said they may do so in the coming days . 
two more countries in the 130-member trade watchdog , the Philippines and El Salvador , could join in the near future .
