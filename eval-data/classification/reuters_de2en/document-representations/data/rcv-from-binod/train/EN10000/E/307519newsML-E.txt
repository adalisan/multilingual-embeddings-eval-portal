China gathered a record 85.07 billion yuan ( $ 10.25 billion ) in tariffs in 1996 , up 21.75 percent compared with 1995 , the China Daily said on Tuesday . 
to boost tariff collection , China last year cut duties on both imports and exports and had adjusted its policies on duty-free status and duty reductions , the newspaper quoted General Administration of Customs officials as saying . 
the ending of tax-free status for capital goods imports by foreign-invested companies and the cancellation of other tax incentives had saved almost 27 billion yuan last year , it said . 
but growth in customs duties had been limited by extensions of tax-free status on capital goods imports for foreign firms with total investment of more than $ 30 million , it said . 
tariff cuts enacted early in the year had failed to stimulate imports , but intensified campaigns against smuggling had paid off with total seizures worth almost 4.0 billion yuan . 
Beijing had introduced a guaranteed deposit system in April to curb smuggling by firms involved in the processing trade , the newspaper said . 
tariff arrears totalling 540 million yuan that were cleared in 1996 had also contributed to revenue growth , it said but gave no details .
