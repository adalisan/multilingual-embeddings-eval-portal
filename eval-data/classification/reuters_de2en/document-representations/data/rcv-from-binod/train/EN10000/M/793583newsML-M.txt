Russia &apos;s booming equity market is seeing a wide range of new money pouring in on the back of earning opportunities and an improved economic and political situation , analysts said . 
they noted a steady influx of Russian money , so far focused on Treasury bills , while Russia &apos;s forthcoming inclusion in the International Finance Corporation &apos;s composite investable index was attracting conservative foreign mutual funds . 
&quot; Everyone and their grandmother is coming here , &quot; said CentreInvest analyst James Fenkner . 
the index of the Russian Trading System , where the bulk of trading takes place , hit four consecutive highs in just the last week and that during a month known more for vacation lethargy than stock market record-setting . 
market volume soared to an all-time high of about $ 120 million last week , against an average daily $ 60- $ 70 million . 
market capitalisation of the 100 biggest companies rose to $ 120.7 billion on August 7 from $ 107.4 billion on July 24 , Creditanstalt Grant &apos;s research chief Tom Balestrery said . 
Russia &apos;s efforts to bring order to its finances through monopoly restructuring , state sell-offs , and a tight monetary policy , which has led to a plan to knock three zeroes off the Russian rouble next year , are paying off , analysts say . 
&quot; Let &apos;s be frank , for a large number of people who are there it &apos;s a quick in and out investment , but there is a broadening of the market , &quot; Deutsche Morgan Grenfell &apos;s ( DMG ) head of Russia research Kingsmill Bond said . 
&quot; We are seeing increasing interest from clients whom one could describe as being longer-term investors , who see Russia as a much more stable investment opportunity , &quot; he said , adding interest from Asian clients was making itself felt also . 
analysts said highly liquid stock in major Russian companies continued to draw the bulk of Western fund allocations , but said investors were increasingly looking to the long-term growth potential of less liquid shares on the Russian Trading System . 
&quot; The action on prices is on the RTS second-tier stock , &quot; said Fenkner . 
&quot; It tends to be manufacturing and oil companies , moving beyond telecoms and energos ( regional utilities ) . 
but DMG &apos;s Bond warned that the influx of new investors into the market , which has helped power the RTS index to a record high 569.23 last week , could backfire and puncture the balloon of market enthusiasm . 
&quot; One concern I have is that many new investors still don &apos;t have an idea of the risks that some of these companies still face , &quot; Bond said . 
&quot; It might have an effect on the market after a couple of months if they realise that what they &apos;ve got is not what they think they have bought . 
despite a market cool-off this week , Russian money , which some traders say has been trickling into top liquid stocks as yields fall on government securities , has for the first time sufficed to hold up prices largely unaided by Western investors . 
Russian banks transferred a record low 583.4 billion roubles for government securities trade on Monday , the central bank said , while annual yields are around 18 percent after 200 percent last year . 
for now , analysts say , Russian money takes a short-term attitude towards equities . 
&quot; Their traders have done T-bills , and have gone into equity trading the same way -- it &apos;s very much trend-following and momentum trading , &quot; said Fenkner . 
but Rossiisky Kredit Bank head of sales and trading Oleg Martynenko , estimating Russian investment had grown by about 50 percent in the last two months , said the trend was shifting to less liquid stock such as local telecoms and power companies . 
&quot; Russian investors are mostly looking at blue chips , but they have already started to invest in the second , third and fourth tier , &quot; Martynenko said , predicting a gradual restructuring of portfolios over the next six months to a year . 
&quot; I think there will be a change from a purely speculative to a long-term approach as Russian investors look for value .
