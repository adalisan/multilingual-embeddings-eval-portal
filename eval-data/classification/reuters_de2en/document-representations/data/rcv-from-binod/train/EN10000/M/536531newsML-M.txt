sterling will remain near current levels during the year ahead , but could fade somewhat against the dollar if the coming UK election leads to dramatic shifts in economic policy , North American analysts predicted . 
in the latest Reuters poll , analysts on average saw cable dipping from $ 1.6325 in the second quarter of 1997 to $ 1.6109 in early 1998 . 
that forecast is a bit weaker than three months ago , when the consensus view was for a cable rate of $ 1.6440 at the start of 1998 . 
with polls showing the UK Labor party comfortably ahead of Prime Minister John Major &apos;s Conservatives , pundits said the uncertainty of a power shift bodes poorly for the pound . 
&quot; The key is , is there going to be a significant policy shift , &quot; said Donald Ratajczak , director of forecasting at Georgia State University . 
Labor leader Tony Blair has sounded only slightly more interested than Major in injecting the pound into the proposed European Monetary Union , a key issue for sterling going forward . 
the relatively healthy UK economy should bolster the pound against its European neighbors and help it keep pace with the robust dollar , analysts said . 
you &apos;ve got modest growth and inflation and a slow decline in the unemployment rate , which is considerably lower than in Europe , &quot; Ratajczak said . 
&quot; All this is favorable for the currency , &quot; he added .
