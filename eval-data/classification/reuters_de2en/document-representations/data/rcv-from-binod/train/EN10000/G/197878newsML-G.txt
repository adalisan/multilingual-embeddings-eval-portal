NATO ambassadors agreed in principle on Monday that an international force should stay in Bosnia next year to cement the fragile peace . 
officials have said that a reduced force is likely to be 25,000 to 30,000 strong . 
the ambassadors decided to consult their governments on a U.S. plan for NATO in Bosnia and to meet again to discuss it on Wednesday . 
they had been discussing four options ranging from total withdrawal to retaining the current IFOR presence . 
the NATO official said all countries which had not previously committed themselves to providing troops for the new force did so at Monday &apos;s meeting . 
a final decision on the shape and size of the force and how long it will stay in Bosnia will be taken in December by NATO ministers . 
Washington declared on Friday it was willing to extend its presence in Bosnia for up to a year and a half and most countries accept that a full withdrawal would hurl the country back into war . 
NATO sources said the reduced force -- down from some 60,000 troops at IFOR &apos;s peak -- would have a &quot; less intensive &quot; presence in Bosnia , but would be strong enough to bolster efforts by civilian authorities to cement the Dayton peace accord . 
&quot; We will still have enough troops to deal with any trouble , &quot; one source said . 
Washington has said it is willing to keep some 8,500 troops in the region , reviewing their situation every six months until the middle of 1998 at the latest . 
other countries have suggested the new slimmed-down IFOR remains on the ground for about a year , with its numbers being reduced throughout the period . 
although some countries , notably Germany , would like the force to have a wider mandate to hunt down alleged war criminals , NATO &apos;s military leaders are opposed to a policing role for the security force .
