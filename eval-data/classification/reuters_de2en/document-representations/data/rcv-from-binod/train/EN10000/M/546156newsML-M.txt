IPE Brent staged a late recovery on Tuesday as a combination of strong U.S. products , supply-related news and technicals pushed the market higher , traders said . 
traders attributed the contract &apos;s initial thrust higher to rumours of a problem at a major northeast U.S. refinery . 
NYMEX players soon quashed the rumour , saying it had been bandied about by a player who was long in gasoline . 
renewed strengh in the NYMEX gasoline and heating oil was also seen as underpinning the market . 
may gasoline was 1.16 cents higher at 63.50 cents a gallon , while May heating oil was 1.97 cents up at 58.50 cents . 
some players said the NYMEX gains were linked to expectations of mildly bullish American Petroleum Institute ( API ) data which was also due to released late on Tuesday . 
according to a Reuter survey , analysts expect the data to show crude stocks fell by 1.0 million barrels , distillates by 1.0 million barrels and gasoline by 500,000 barrels . 
traders said news loadings of Norwegian Gullfaks A crude oil were delayed 2-3 days from Tuesday due to problems at the new Vigdis field had also helped the market . 
the fact that the June Brent contract had broken above $ 18.50 and held above there was also seen as supportive .
