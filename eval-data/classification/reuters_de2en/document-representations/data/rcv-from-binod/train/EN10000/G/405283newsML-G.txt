Australian gay activists on Wednesday won a major victory in their fight to overturn anti-homosexual laws which carry jail terms of up to 21 years , when the country &apos;s top court ruled it would hear their case . 
the High Court of Australia rejected an appeal to dismiss the activists &apos; case by the state government of Tasmania , the only state where the anti-homosexual laws exist . 
although the Tasmanian laws are seldom used , the court ruled that they &quot; overshadow &quot; the personal lives of homosexuals on the island state and that gays in Tasmania have a right to know whether state laws or national human rights laws take precedent . 
under the Tasmanian laws the act of homosexuality is regarded as &quot; unnatural sexual intercourse &quot; and is illegal in public or private , while Australia &apos;s 1994 human rights act guarantees the privacy of consenting adults . 
&quot; Today has been a very important victory for us , &quot; Rodney Croome , one of the co-appellants , told Reuters . 
&quot; The major hurdle has been overcome and now we have to run the race . 
&quot; This ruling is a morale booster for the gay and lesbian community in Tasmania -- a community that has often been beseiged by vocal minorities in Tasmania who support this law and who are homophobic in the extreme . 
the Tasmanian government had asked the High Court to dismiss the activists &apos; case , arguing that prosecutions under the anti-homosexual laws were rare and that the two gay activists were not threatened with prosecution . 
however , the court ruled that the activists &apos; declaration to the court that they have engaged in homosexual sex still left them vulnerable to prosecution . 
&quot; The fact that the director of public prosecutions does not propose to prosecute does not remove that liability , &quot; it said . 
the court said the prosecutor did not charge the activists in 1994 because it feared the case would have been perceived as a &quot; manufactured &quot; case and become a &quot; showcase trial &quot; . 
the court also said that the activists were &quot; entitled to know &quot; whether state or national laws govern their lives . 
&quot; The court has sent out a very strong message that where two laws conflict , a federal and state law , Australians citizens have a right to know which law governs their conduct , &quot; Croome said . 
&quot; That &apos;s an important decision for all Australians . 
Croome said the basis of his challenge to the Tasmanian laws was that they became invalid with the introduction of the 1994 national privacy laws . 
a U.N. human rights committee ruled in April 1994 that the Tasmanian laws breached privacy provisions under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
