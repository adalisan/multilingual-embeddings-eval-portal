Burundi &apos;s President Pierre Buyoya , his country under sanctions following a military coup last month , flew on Sunday to Tanzania to meet former president Julius Nyerere , presidential officials said in Bujumbura . 
Nyerere is playing a leading role in mediation between Buyoya and other African leaders . 
the meeting was taking place at Butiama , Nyerere &apos;s home in western Tanzania , Buyoya &apos;s aides said . 
they gave no further details , but said Buyoya was expected to return to Bujumbura later on Sunday . 
Buyoya &apos;s meeting with Nyerere was the latest in a series of high-level contacts with leaders in Tanzania and Uganda since the East African states imposed sanctions on trade and communications with Burundi after the July 25 coup there . 
East African ministers meeting in Kampala , the Ugandan capital , this month agreed to ban travel to and from Burundi by members of the Buyoya government . 
despite this declaration , there have been several high-level meetings between Buyoya ministers and representatives of other African governments , with Burundi apparently seeking a softening of the trade sanctions . 
the sanctions are hitting Burundi hard . 
strict rationing of petrol is already in force and there is a growing shortage of many other imported goods . 
Burundi has no local oil supplies , and normally imports petrol througth Tanzania &apos;s Indian Ocean port , Dar es Salaam . 
goods are normally carried by rail across Tanzania to the Lake Tanganyika port of Kigoma , and from there by ship to Bujumbura . 
but the movement of ships from Kigoma to Bujumbura has halted , and Tanzania and Zaire recently agreed to step up efforts to stop the smuggling of goods to Burundi in small boats on Lake Tanganyika .
