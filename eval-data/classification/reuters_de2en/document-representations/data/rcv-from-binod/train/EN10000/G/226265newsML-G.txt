in a rare statement from shadowy spymasters , Mongolia &apos;s Centre for espionage has denied spying on former-Communist opposition politicians since a general election swept them from power in June . 
but the centre , known in Mongolian as the TTG , said that before the June elections it had spied on journalists on behalf of the former-Communist Mongolian People &apos;s Revolutionary Party ( MPRP ) which had ruled this north Asian nation . 
&quot; We announce that the ( current ) government of Mongolia has not ordered the TTG to spy on any political individual or group , &quot; the centre said in a statement seen on Friday .. 
MPRP officials have in recent weeks accused Mongolia &apos;s new government of democratic reformers of using the TTG &apos;s agents to spy on them for political gain and have demanded the resignation of Prime Minister M. Enkhsaikhan . 
the Mongolian parliament has formed a group to investigate the accusations which the TTG has dismissed as false . 
&quot; Statements made by the MPRP are based on false information , &quot; it said , accusing the former communists of illegally contacting TTG staff . 
the new reformist government recently sacked the head of the espionage centre and other key figures in the organisation . 
while denying wrong-doing in the recent past , the centre said it had conducted questionable activities under the MPRP . 
&quot; There are documents that prove that ... the TTG spied on some people in the media without justification and that it carried out very active espionage during the 1996 general election , &quot; it said . 
it gave no details of the targets of surveillance during the elections in which the MPRP suffered a crushing blow , losing 45 of the 70 seats it had held in the Great Hural , or parliament . 
the MPRP newspaper Truth on Wednesday quoted party leader N. Enkhbayar as saying the party had recently been spied on by the Centre for espionage . 
&quot; We have information that at the least there has been monitoring of phone calls , tailing of people and the controlling of some journalists , &quot; Enkhbayar was quoted as saying .
