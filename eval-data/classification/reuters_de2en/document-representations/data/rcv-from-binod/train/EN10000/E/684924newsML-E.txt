Bank of France chief Jean-Claude Trichet said on Tuesday that it was essential to make cuts in the public deficits in 1997 . 
presenting the bank &apos;s annual report at a news conference , Trichet said : &quot; Reducing public deficits is indispensible in 1997 as it is in the medium term . 
Trichet said France &apos;s payroll deductions to fund the welfare system were too high and public spending must also fall . 
Trichet stressed the report was written before the new Socialist-led government announced its policy programme last week and did not constitute a response to it . 
he called for continuing wage restraint and said the ratio of public spending to gross domestic product of 54.5 percent was &quot; manifestly too high &quot; and should be reduced gradually and substantially to the European Union ( EU ) average of 49.9 percent . 
Trichet said monetary policy had brought French market interest rates to historic lows but was not sufficient to fight unemployment , which required structural reforms and sustained deficit reduction . 
he said market interest rates were low because the franc was stable and credible and vowed the Bank of France would continue its action in 1997-98 to ensure that the euro inspired as much confidence as the franc .
