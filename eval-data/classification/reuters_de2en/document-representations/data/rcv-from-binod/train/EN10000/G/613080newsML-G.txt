suspected neo-Nazi arsonists burnt down a Catholic church in the north German port of Luebeck early on Sunday , police said . 
firefighters found Nazi swastika symbols scrawled in the aisle of the St Vicelin Church -- two of them around the name of a local priest who is campaigning to stop Algerian asylum-seekers from being deported , police said . 
the fire started in a shed next to the church . 
several bottles of propane gas in the shed exploded spreading the blaze to the church , police said . 
firefighters struggled to control the blaze for several hours but the building , which was too dangerous to enter , was still burning several hours later . 
the local priest had given the asylum-seekers refuge inside his church so that they could not be deported home to Algeria . 
in January last year 10 foreigners , most of them asylum-seekers from Africa , died in a blaze at a hostel in Luebeck . 
the blaze raised fears of a new wave of neo-Nazi racist violence similar to one which swept across the country after unification in 1990 but later a Lebanese resident was charged with arson and is now on trial .
