a convicted murderer in the United States whose campaign for a reprieve from imminent execution has mobilised Italy was quoted on Tuesday as saying he was terrified of dying as &quot; an innocent man . 
the newspapers La Repubblica and Il Giornale said they had interviewed Joseph O &apos;Dell by telephone at the Mecklenburg correctional Center in Boydton , Virginia . 
he is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Wednesday . 
he said he had asked for his sperm to be frozen in the event of his execution so that his wife , Lori Urs , could have a child . 
la Reppublica quoted O &apos;Dell as saying he wanted Pope John Paul , who has pleaded for a reprieve , to pray for him . 
&quot; It &apos;s nice all the same to know that I won &apos;t be dying alone like the other people in this death house where they go to their execution in silence , &quot; he said . 
o &apos;Dell was found guilty in 1985 of the murder and rape of a 44-year-old secretary , Helen Schartner of Virigina Beach , Virginia , whom he is alleged to have abducted at gunpoint . 
he and his supporters say that post-trial DNA testing shows that blood stains on his clothing do not match the victim &apos;s and want the case re-opened . 
they have petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay of execution as well as seeking clemency from Virginia governor George Allen . 
the campaign , much of it conducted over the Internet , has made front page news in Italy , which is a strong supporter of the push for a worldwide abolition of capital punishment . 
virtually all reports have accepted O &apos;Dell &apos;s protestations of innocence almost uncritically and argued that as long as there is doubt in the case he should not be executed . 
the Pope and President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro have both called for a reprieve . 
Parliament , Italian lawyers and the national Red Cross have also taken up the case . 
several rights groups , including the anti-death penalty organisation Hands off Cain and Amnesty International , were planning a torchlit vigil for O &apos;Dell outside the U.S. embassy on Rome &apos;s Via Veneto on Tuesday evening . 
&quot; As the O &apos;Dell case regards solely the state of Virginia and not the federal government we are passing these on to the state authorities , &quot; the spokesman said . 
o &apos;Dell &apos;s case has not so far drawn much publicity in the United States , where 38 states have the death penalty . 
Texas leads the nation with 107 executions since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976 , followed by Florida with 38 and Virginia with 36 . 
the eighth person executed in Virginia this year , the most in any U.S. state in 1996 , died by lethal injection on Monday . 
Ronald Lee Hoke SR was convicted of raping , robbing and stabbing a woman to death in 1985 .
