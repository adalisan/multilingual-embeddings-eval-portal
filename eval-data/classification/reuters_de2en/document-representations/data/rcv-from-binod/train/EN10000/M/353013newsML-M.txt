the FTSE 100 opened weaker on Monday , easing from the record levels set on Friday , after the Dow &apos;s early rally faltered , dealers said . 
the Dow , up 43 points when London closed , ended 10.77 points lower at 6,813.09 , though most broader indices held on to gains . 
&quot; I think it will be a fairly quiet morning , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; Friday &apos;s ( U.S. ) figures showed there &apos;s still growth , but that inflation isn &apos;t a problem .
