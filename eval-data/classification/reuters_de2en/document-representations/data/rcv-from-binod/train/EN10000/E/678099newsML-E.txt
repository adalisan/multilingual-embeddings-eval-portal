a leading German economic research institute on Friday attacked the planned revaluation of German currency reserves as an &quot; accounting trick &quot; by the government to reduce public debt in 1998 . 
Heiner Flassbeck , chief economist at the Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research ( DIW ) , said in a newspaper interview that the Bonn government was conducting &quot; a currency and economic policy bordering on the limits of respectability &quot; . 
Flassbeck said it was unclear whether the European Union would acknowledge the special profit resulting from the revaluation as a way to cut the debt since it breached the principle of sustainability enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty on European Union . 
the interview was published in the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung . 
the German government and the Bundesbank agreed on Thursday to revalue the central bank &apos;s currency reserves this year . 
finance Minister Theo Waigel and Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer hammered out the final details of the plan , which could provide the government with well over 10 billion marks ( $ 5.8 billion ) in additional revenue that it will use to pay off old debt . 
the deal reflects a compromise allowing Bonn to benefit from the revaluation of foreign exchange reserves but appears to leave central bank gold reserves untouched until after the start of European monetary union . 
the Bundesbank on Thursday dismissed statements by sources in the Bonn coalition government who had said that Waigel and Tietmeyer agreed the Bundesbank would revalue its dollar reserves at a rate of at least 1.50 marks per dollar . 
the current market rate is around 1.7230 marks . 
the Bundesbank &apos;s currency reserves of $ 65.7 billion are thought to consist only of dollars and are currently booked at 1.3620 marks . 
Bonn coalition sources said this meant the central bank would transfer up to 13 billion marks to the government next year .
