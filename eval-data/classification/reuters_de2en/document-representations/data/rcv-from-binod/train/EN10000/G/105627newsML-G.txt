in Alexander Lebed , NATO feels it has found a Russian leader with whom it can do business over the delicate issue of the Atlantic alliance &apos;s expansion . 
but as the outspoken Russian security chief ended his first visit to the West on Wednesday and headed back to the intrigue at the Kremlin , top alliance officials questioned whether he would survive politically to do the job . 
over a private dinner with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and ambassadors from leading alliance members , Lebed made it clear he wanted to wrest control of Russia-alliance relations from his country &apos;s powerful foreign ministry . 
&quot; If that happens we may have a real interlocutor at long last , he has a refreshingly new style , but it is a very big &apos; if &apos; , &quot; said one alliance official . 
diplomats contrasted Lebed &apos;s style favourably with other Russian leaders , including President Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov , from whom they received little but furious tirades against NATO &apos;s plans for eastwards expansion . 
&quot; The feeling was that here we had a man with whom you could negotiate , he expressed the need for new thinking on both sides , &quot; the official added . 
during his two-day visit , Lebed studiously avoided any repetition of previous anti-NATO outbursts and won admirers for his a &quot; down-to-earth &quot; style combining firmness with a willingness to exchange views . 
Solana on Wednesday described the visit as &quot; very positive &quot; . 
&quot; Both from the point of view of Russia and NATO , &quot; he told reporters after a routine meeting with Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene . 
the tone was set in Lebed &apos;s first meeting with Solana . 
in as many minutes , Lebed described NATO three times as a &quot; strike fist &quot; . 
Solana intervened : &quot; No , An open hand &quot; . 
&quot; Then , I had better change my terminology , &quot; a thoughtful Lebed growled back in his distinctive low rumble of a voice . 
ironically , the success of the visit -- essentially crowning Lebed as &quot; president-in-waiting &quot; should Yeltsin fail to recover from heart illness -- could be his political undoing . 
barely had he stepped aboard the aircraft taking him home when Russian news agencies reported he had been summoned to appear before parliament , dominated by hardliners , to clarify his position on NATO following his talks in Brussels . 
during his absence , opponents of his peace deal in Chechnya relaunched a campaign against the 46-year-old ex-paratroop general . 
diplomats say he could now face an even more bitter fight if he tries to take influence from the foreign ministry . 
&quot; They will fight like tigers , I cannot see Lebed winning that one , &quot; said one senior NATO diplomat , an expert on Russia . 
clearly enjoying himself , Lebed spent two days touring the alliance &apos;s sprawling political headquarters in Brussels and its military nerve centre at Mons in southern Belgium . 
at meetings with the world &apos;s media , a smiling Lebed praised NATO &apos;s efficiency , pledged more Russian cooperation , and -- crucially -- said it had the right to expand although he would prefer it not to do so , and certainly not so soon . 
in a headline grabbing phrase , he said they should skip a generation to allow the bitterness of the Cold War to fade . 
&quot; We are all victims , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It was a persuasive argument and one which could create difficulties for NATO , &quot; one alliance source said . 
independent analysts said a sophisticated argument from Moscow could make life difficult for alliance leaders , set to to open membership talks with countries such as Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic next year . 
&quot; Why hurry ? 
the public can understand that , &quot; the alliance source added .
