the Croatian average lending rate slipped to 11 percent on Friday from 13.2 percent , weighed down by call money loans at 10 percent . 
the money market trade totalled 79.5 million kuna due to heavy end-of-week interbank demand , compared to no more than 14.6 million kuna on Thursday . 
fresh bank borrowings accounted for all but 16.3 million and seemed established at new lower price levels . 
interbank rates ranged between 9.4 percent for one-week and 18 percent for 30-day funds . 
insurers rolled over old 14- and 30-day loans to savings banks at 12 and 19 percent respectively . 
the central bank said it stayed out of the foreign exchange market after buying currency from the banking sector earlier this week . 
the next intervention -- used to help liquidity and prevent the kuna from appreciating -- is likely on Monday , an official told Reuters . 
the kuna midrates for Saturday and Monday eased to 6.1675 against the dollar and firmed to 3.5673 versus the German mark .
