defence Minister Charles Millon will inspect French troops based in Chad and Gabon on a three-day trip from Saturday as well as meet leaders of the two African nations , his spokesman said on Thursday . 
Millon will visit Chad on Saturday and Sunday and Gabon on Monday , Pierre Servent said . 
&quot; These visits follow similar visits he has made to Djibouti , Senegal and the Ivory Coast and confirm the importance which France attaches to Africa and to its traditional friends there , &quot; Servent told reporters . 
France has maintained several garrisons and thousands of troops in former African colonies for decades . 
the forces , which have intervened countless times on the continent , have often served to prop up governments friendly to Paris .
