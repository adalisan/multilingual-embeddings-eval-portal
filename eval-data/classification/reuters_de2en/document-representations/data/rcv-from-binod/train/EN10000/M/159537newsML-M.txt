clean tanker chartering activity saw increased interest from charterers for tonnage for longer haul voyages from the West to the East this week , particularly from the Mediterranean , brokers said . 
&quot; It is hoped that this is the start of an eagerly awaited trend which should use initiate better utilisation of available tonnage , &quot; brokers E.A. 
Gibson said in their weekly report . 
however , the picture for shipowners is still fairly bleak , according to some brokers with surplus tonnage building up in the Med and Mideast Gulf as charterers refrained from booking trips to early in the light of growing avails . 
Mideast Gulf markets were quieter this week but rates for 30kt cargoes held steady around W240 for trips to India . 
however , brokers said that unless there is a greater level of enquiry , prices could soon start to drift lower as more tonnage becomes available . 
MED markets showed a similar vein with charterers of early November cargoes holding for cheaper rates . 
good interest was seen to move product to the east during the week with gas oil booked to east coast India at $ 950,000 , basis one load , two discharge ports . 
a cracker shutdown at the Amuay Bay refinery in Venezuela , now expected to return around Nov 16 , dampened upcoast trade for products this week although some interest was seen to move Jet fuel from the Caribbean to the Far East . 
inter U.K. CONT markets saw limited business . 
gas oil ex-ventspils to NWE drew a steady W175 for 25kt and UK-Cont trips held around W200 .
