U.S. and North Korean diplomats met in New York on Friday for &quot; serious and useful &quot; talks about the North &apos;s submarine incursion into South Korean waters , the U.S. State Department said on Saturday . 
spokeswoman Phyllis Young said she could not confirm South Korean media reports that Pyongyang will soon comply with the South &apos;s demand that it apologise for the incursion . 
but Young said U.S. and North Korean diplomats met in New York on Friday . 
&quot; The talks were serious and useful , &quot; she said , without giving any details of the substance of the talks . 
additional meetings were probable , she said . 
the U.S. officials are pressing North Korea to make a statement about the Sept . 18 submarine incident &quot; that satisfies &quot; the South . 
previous working-level meetings took place on Saturday and on Monday . 
the submarine incident , in which 26 North Korean commandos went ashore , infuriated Seoul , which put relations with the North into a deep freeze pending an apology . 
a South Korean foreign ministry official said Saturday that his country has details of an apology from Pyongyang over the incident and the affair may be settled within a day . 
South Korea has demanded an apology as the price of resuming aid to the North and implementing a 1994 agreement between Washington and Pyongyang under which it will supply nuclear reactors to North Korea . 
twenty-four of the intruders were shot and killed , one was captured alive and one is still on the loose . 
the agents killed several South Korean soldiers in shootouts and murdered civilians while dodging a massive dragnet .
