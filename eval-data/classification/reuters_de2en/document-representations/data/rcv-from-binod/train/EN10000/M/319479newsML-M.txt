the market capitalisation of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange ( TASE ) was 249 billion shekels at the end of 1996 , compared with 230 billion shekels at the end of 1995 , the exchange said on Monday . 
market capitalisation showed an 8.3 nominal increase from the end of 1995 but a slight decline after inflation , which was 10.6 percent last year . 
the combined capitalisation of shares and convertibles rose just 1.8 percent before inflation . 
last year , the TASE &apos;s Mishtanim index of the top 100 stocks fell 8.5 percent . 
daily trading volume in equities declined for the third year in a row , reflecting the market slump that began at the start of 1994 . 
adjusted for inflation , total trading volume for 1996 was 26.7 billion shekels , down from 31.9 billion shekels in 1995 and 98.4 billion in 1994 , the TASE said . 
however , trading volume increased for bonds and Makams , zero-coupon unlinked certificates issued by the government with durations of three months to one year . 
as a result the exchange &apos;s total trading volume reached 126.5 billion shekels last year , up from 103.2 billion shekels in 1995 , the exchange said . 
total capital raised was 2.55 billion , almost unchanged from 1995 , the exchange said . 
however , most of the figure came from TASE-traded companies that are also listed overseas , principally in the United States , that raised money overseas . 
in the bond market , the Israeli government raised 25.26 billion shekels , up from 17 billion shekels in 1995 . 
however , redemptions rose to 23.43 billion shekels from 10.91 billion in 1995 . 
the number of listed companies with equities trading at the end of 1996 was 655 , up by one from a year earlier .
