improved profits in the U.S. cattle feeding business sparked an increase in the number of cattle placed on feed at large feedlots during February over last year &apos;s figure , livestock analysts said . 
the U.S. Agriculture Department is expected to confirm the larger numbers on Friday in its monthly cattle on Feed report , set for release at 1400 CST / 2000 GMT . 
a pre-report survey of analysts indicated placements , the most important aspect of this month &apos;s data , were expected to exceed the five-year average in the seven key states . 
placement estimates averaged 104.3 percent of a year ago in the survey and ranged from 99.0 to 110.0 percent . 
however , analysts noted placements were lighter in February , 1996 than in February 1995 , which accounted for some of the higher percentage estimates . 
improved profit margins during February also boosted placements . 
analysts also projected the data will show the number of cattle on feed in feedlots of 1,000 head or more capacity on March 1 at an average of 106.5 percent of a year ago . 
analyst estimates ranged from 105.0 to 107.5 percent . 
&quot; In February we turned some better profits then we did in January - February close-out came out $ 8 to $ 10 ahead profitable , &quot; said Jim Robb with Livestock Marketing Information Center , who estimated placements at 103.1 percent . 
cost of gain was below last year at the beginning of the month and the profitable picture pulled more feeder cattle into feedlots . 
placements were below two years ago but above the five year average , analysts predicted . 
&quot; My figure of 1.515 million ( 105 percent ) is one percent under the 1995 figure which is a record for this new series , &quot; said Dan Vaught , analyst with A.G.Edwards. 
analysts continued to estimate seven-state numbers while building historical data on the new 12-state part of the report . 
USDA made revisions to its seven-state report and introduced a 12-state report in January 1996 . 
even analysts at the low end of expectations for February placements considered the February placement rate high . 
&quot; Even with placements about even with a year ago , we &apos;re still up almost eight percent above the five-year average , &quot; said Karl Skold , director of research for Frontier Risk Management , who estimated placements at 99.6 percent . 
analysts expect February marketing data to show fairly active feedlot sales as feedlots kept current . 
however , there was one less marketing day prompted estimates of under 100 percent . 
February seven-state marketing estimates averaged 97.9 percent of a year ago , in a range of 94.0 to 99.0 . 
&quot; Very clearly the weight data on the fed cattle side coming out of feedlots is still running well below a year ago so feedlots are still very current . 
they ( feedlots ) were pulling cattle ahead in February - they are extremely current out there , &quot; Robb said . 
USDA last week reported the average weight of fed cattle slaughtered under federal inspection the week ended March 8 at 1,167 lbs , slightly up from 1,165 lbs the previous week but well below 1,183 lbs a year earlier . 
but not all analysts look for a bullish marketing number and noted that the USDA number will depend on whether cattle sold during February but not shipped are included in the total . 
Bob Price , economist for Cargill investor Services Inc , said he was not as bullish on marketings because feedlots still had a lot of cattle at the end of February that had not been shipped . 
&quot; What happened during February is we started the month with the packers really having nothing bought in the feedyards that wasn &apos;t shipped yet and we ended the month with the packer having quite a bit of inventory that he already bought at the feedyards that wasn &apos;t yet shipped , &quot; Price said .
