more than any other grand slam tournament , the French Open tends to crown unexpected winners . 
this year should be no exception . 
world number one Pete Sampras has been unable to win a match on clay this season and had to pull out of the World team Cup this week with a thigh strain . 
defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov has endured a season interrupted by injury and looks unlikely to repeat last year &apos;s feat when he became the first Russian to win a Grand Slam event . 
once unbeatable on the slow surface , Austrian Thomas muster has yet to win a tournament on clay this season . 
Andre Agassi has pulled out with a wrist injury and Boris Becker has withdrawn with an unspecified complaint . 
past winners Jim courier and Sergi Bruguera have been doing a little bit better this year than in a lacklustre 1996 but are still far from their peak . 
by contrast , the Spanish armada have been even more impressive than usual on clay this season with Alex Corretja their new leader , But since Bruguera beat Alberto Berasategui in the 1994 final , Spaniards have failed to confirm here their fine results in previous clay court tournaments . 
Croatian Goran Ivanisevic and Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek have recorded some good results on clay in the past but are far too inconsistent . 
as a result , Michael Chang and Marcelo Rios , the two shortest players in the top 20 , but also the best runners behind their baseline may be the safest bests for final victory . 
Chang , an unexpected winner here in 1989 , lost in the final in 1995 . 
given the circumstances , he could well go one step further this year . 
like Sampras , Chang has struggled on clay this season , losing in the first round in Rome as well as in the American red clay court championships . 
but after a perfect hardcourt season , the world number two looks like he just needs practice on the surface to shine again . 
&quot; I haven &apos;t made the transition yet &quot; , he said last week in Rome . 
Rios , on the other hand , has been with Corretja the most successful player on clay this year , beating the Spaniard in Monte Carlo before losing against him in the Rome final . 
it remains to be seen whether the talented Chilean can stand the pressure of two weeks of five setters . 
the same applies to Corretja , who had his best season ever with wins in Estoril and Rome . 
&quot; The next step will be to win a Grand Slam , &quot; he said after his victory in the Italian Open . 
the 23-year-old Catalan leads yet another impressive Spanish squad including Bruguera , Berasategui , Albert Costa , Carlos Moya , Felix Mantilla , Carlos Costa , Francisco Clavet and Emilio Alvarez . 
as usual , Sampras remains an enigma on clay . 
is his injury serious ? 
has he worked hard enough on clay to be able to snatch at last the only grand slam title still eluding him ? 
by winning the Italian Open in 1995 , the American proved he was capable of adapting his game to clay . 
and he usually had his best results in Paris with very little preparation on the surface such as last year when he reached the semifinals , losing only to Kafelnikov . 
the Russian is another player with more questions than answers ahead of the French Open . 
after losing to Berasategui in Rome , he said it &quot; would take a miracle &quot; for him to retain his crown . 
Parisian crowds will hope that such uncertainty may favour one of their compatriots . 
Cedric Pioline , winner in Prague earlier this month , and Fabrice Santoro , who has had his best results in years in Monte Carlo and Prague , will be the local favourites .
