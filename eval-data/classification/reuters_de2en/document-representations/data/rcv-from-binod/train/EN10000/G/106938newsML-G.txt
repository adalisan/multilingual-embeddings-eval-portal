the U.S. special envoy to Israeli-PLO peace talks said on Wednesday the two sides were trying hard to understand each other &apos;s concerns on the issue of Hebron . 
the envoy , Dennis Ross , said Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation asked him to issue the statement after three-and-a-half hours of talks on Tuesday , adding : &quot; They are making a serious effort to understand each other &apos;s concerns . 
earlier the PLO accused Israel of making demands that had deadlocked the talks on a long-promised troop pullback from the West Bank city . 
&quot; We are still in a deadlock . 
the Americans are expected to come up with bridging proposals , &quot; Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour told Reuters . 
he said Israel wanted to cut the size of the Palestinian police force due to take control of parts of Hebron and was insisting they be armed with pistols and not rifles . 
the Israel-PLO talks resumed on Sunday after violence sparked by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s opening of an archaeological tunnel near Islamic sites in Arab East Jerusalem last month cost the lives of 59 Palestinians and 15 Israelis . 
Israel agreed in a deal with the PLO last year to withdraw from most of Hebron , a city holy to Moslems and Jews , after pulling out of other large West Bank towns to make room for Palestinian self-rule . 
Netanyahu wants added measures to ensure the security of 400 Jewish settlers in the city of 100,000 Arabs before pulling his troops back .
