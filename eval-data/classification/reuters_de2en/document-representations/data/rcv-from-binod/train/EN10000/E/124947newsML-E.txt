Italy &apos;s 1996 public sector deficit might exceed the latest government target of 123 trillion lire , Treasury undersecretary Filippo Cavazzuti said . 
&quot; The risk of overshooting the 123 trillion lire deficit figure for 1996 is now unfortunately a given fact , &quot; Cavazzuti was quoted as saying in a parliamentary bulletin , taken from proceedings at Wednesday &apos;s budget committee hearing . 
the government upgraded its 1996 public sector borrowing requirement ( PSBR ) target to 123 trillion lire from a previous 113 trillion lire . 
Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio warned earlier this month that the 1996 PSBR might be over 130 trillion lire . 
&quot; The government is betting on a reduction in interest rate differentials . 
this will allow Italy to immediately re-enter the European Exchange Rate Mechanism ( ERM ) , &quot; Cavazzuti was quoted as saying .
