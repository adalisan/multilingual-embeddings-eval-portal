supporters of the Bahamas &apos; ruling party danced in the streets on Saturday to celebrate their overwhelming election victory , as the party &apos;s leader and his principle opponent traded jibes about campaign spending . 
Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham &apos;s Free National Movement ( FNM ) took 34 out of 40 seats in the archipelago nation &apos;s parliament , according to results released on Friday night by state election officials , trouncing the Progressive Liberal Party ( PLP ) , led by former prime minister and Bahamian independence leader Sir Lynden Pindling . 
but even as he stood in the midst of thousands of gleeful supporters during an overnight victory celebration , Ingraham expressed disappointment with charges by his rival that the FNM &apos;s huge victory was the result of massive campaign spending . 
&quot; I was disappointed that he could not be gracious in defeat . 
it hurts me and pains me that someone who has been in office for as long as he has cannot accept that the population of the Bahamas can say no to him , &quot; he told reporters . 
Ingraham , a 49-year-old lawyer , was a former protege of Pindling . 
Pindling , 67 , led the Bahamas to majority rule in 1967 and independence from Britain in 1973 , and his policies helped to create a large black middle class . 
but his reputation was badly tarnished by corruption allegations and he suffers from prostate cancer . 
he was one of the few FNM candidates who retained his seat in Friday &apos;s vote . 
Pindling had told the press after learning of the PLP defeat on Friday night that he would have to consult with other members of his party about what he termed &quot; a massive amount of ( FNM ) money in circulation &quot; on the islands of Abaco , Eleuthra , Cat Island and Exuma . 
Ingraham denied the charge and said that , on the contrary , his campaign had cut back its spending during the last days of the campaign because he feared the FNM would capture all 40 seats in parliament , a development he said would be risky for the nation &apos;s democracy . 
the Bahamas , home to about 254,000 people , is a chain of islands in the Atlantic Ocean east of Florida and the Caribbean . 
about 130,000 Bahamians are registered to vote , and it was estimated that turnout on Friday had been at about the 90 percent typical in the nation &apos;s elections . 
the PLP &apos;s overwhelming defeat raised immediate questions about Pindling &apos;s status as the party &apos;s leader . 
Pindling acknowledged that the party would have to rebuild . 
asked if he had a preference for a successor , he said , &quot; Let &apos;s take one step at a time . 
and it wouldn &apos;t be a question of preference , it would be a question of choice by others . 
the FNM had campaigned on its record since 1992 , saying its government had opened markets , improved the islands &apos; infrastructure , revitalized tourism and created 14,000 new jobs . 
Ingraham said fighting poverty , bad housing and crime should be priority items during the FNM &apos;s second term in office . 
he was expected to name his new cabinet on Wednesday .
