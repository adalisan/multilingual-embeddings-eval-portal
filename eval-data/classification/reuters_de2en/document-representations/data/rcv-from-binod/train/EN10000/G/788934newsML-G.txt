garden gnomes are again disappearing in France now that a spoof group idolising Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has resumed its campaign to &quot; liberate &quot; the statues from flower beds and well-kept lawns . 
the Garden gnomes Liberation Front , which operates seven-member night-time &quot; commandos &quot; to snatch the gnomes , has made off with a dozen ceramic dwarfs this week around Dunkirk , near the Belgian border , residents say . 
the masked raiders declared a &quot; truce &quot; in January after rounding up about 30 gnomes in Normandy and &quot; freeing &quot; them in local forests , presumably to return to the normal life of a story-book dwarf . 
in each of the latest abductions , the Front left a message saying : &quot; Dear Papa , Dear Mama -- I was happy with you but now I have to leave you . 
signed : your garden gnome . 
&quot; One message said the group wanted to &quot; reeducate &quot; the dwarfs .
