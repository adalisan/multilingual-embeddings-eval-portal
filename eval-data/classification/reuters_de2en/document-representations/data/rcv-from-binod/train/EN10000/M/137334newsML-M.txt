Italian bond futures lost their early strength after the lira continued to edge lower while German bunds and T-bonds also eased , dealers said . 
encouraging preliminary October CPI data on Monday and Tuesday pushed the market higher in early trade as investors looked towards an early interest rate cut , but with the dollar showing some vulnerability the lira also eased back . 
&quot; After the rally , the market ran out of steam and preferred to take a more cautious stance looking at the dollar and other bond markets , &quot; said one LIFFE dealer . 
Italy &apos;s 10 sample cities showed October CPI coming in at 3.0 percent year on year against 3.4 percent in September . 
the Bank of Italy has made it clear it wants to see inflation at 3.0 percent or below before cutting its 8.25 percent discount rate . 
if the preliminary inflation data is confirmed by official figures out on November 6 , the market is looking for a Bank of Italy discount rate cut next month . 
but dealers said that buying interest tailed off throughout the day with eyes on the dollar and an upcoming vote of confidence in Italy &apos;s government later today . 
Romano Prodi &apos;s government has called a confidence vote in the lower Chamber of Deputies later today to ensure that a crucial cabinet decree covering a rescue plan for indebted Bank of Naples passes swiftly into law . 
the government is expected to win the vote .
