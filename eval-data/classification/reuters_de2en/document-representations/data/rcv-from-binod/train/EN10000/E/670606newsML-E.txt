Los Angeles County came to market on Wednesday with $ 1.3 billion of tax and revenue anticipation notes in its first unenhanced short-term note deal in two seasons . 
for the last two years , the county has been forced to buy letters of credit because of concerns on Wall Street about its fiscal condition . 
but last week , Moody &apos;s Investors Service Inc rated the county &apos;s short-term notes MIG-1 , Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s Corp rated them SP-1-plus , and Fitch Investors Service Inc assigned them an F-1-plus grade . 
the ratings -- the highest offered -- enabled the county to issue its short-term notes Wednesday without a letter of credit , saving the county an estimated $ 2 million , county finance officials said . 
Maureen Sicotte , the county &apos;s director of public finance , said the deal &apos;s underwriters &quot; had to work the street &quot; to sell the notes . 
&quot; We got where we needed to be , but it took some work , &quot; she said . 
Sicotte said the unenhanced notes were priced at the same level as last year &apos;s note offering , which was enhanced . 
&quot; We are very pleased , &quot; she said . 
Underwriter Merrill Lynch &amp; Co said Wednesday it priced the county &apos;s notes with a 3.80 percent yield and a 4.50 percent coupon . 
the notes are dated 7 / 1 / 1997 and due 6 / 30 / 1998 .
