Irish bonds firmed at the short-end in active late trade on Friday as the market awaited a plethora of economic data early next week , dealers said . 
&quot; The day has been dominated by the strength of Irish bonds at the short-end of the curve . 
it was a high volume day , with good interest in the Irish market at home and abroad , especially at the short-end &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; At this stage we are looking towards early next week with a lot of international data out while , of course , we have the Irish budget next Wednesday ... We are also expecting supply in the two and five-year areas in the U.S. , &quot; the dealer added . 
economists are expecting tax cuts of up to 400 million punts to be announced in Wednesday &apos;s annual Irish budget and estimate a post budget EBR of between 585 to 755 million punts . 
Monday sees the release of German M3 money supply data while the closely watched IFO business climate report is expected on Tuesday . 
by 1645 GMT , the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 had gained 25 pence from Thursday &apos;s close at 102.65 to yield 5.75 percent while the key benchmark eight percent bond due 2006 was unchanged from the close at 109.90 to yield 6.57 percent . 
dealers said the spreads between Irish bonds had narrowed , Ireland was trading 153 basis points over bunds in the five-year area , versus 162 late on Thursday , and 85 basis points over bunds in the 10-year area , versus 87 late Thursday . 
a slew of U.S. economic indicators that some had hoped could send Bunds higher failed to have much lasting impact on debt markets and traders were content to end the week with what have been good gains .
