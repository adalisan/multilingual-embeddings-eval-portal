the Organisation of African Unity called on Wednesday for a return to democracy in Nigeria and Burundi , and the new OAU chairman said Africa would not tolerate military takeovers in future . 
&quot; We are getting tougher and tougher each time . 
I can assure that for future coups , it will be much tougher , &quot; Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe , the OAU &apos;s new chairman , told a news conference . 
Mugabe said there was no contradiction between the outright condemnation at the OAU &apos;s three-day summit in Harare of a May 25 coup in Sierra Leone and the presence at the conference of the military governments of Nigeria and Burundi . 
&quot; Whilst on the face of it there appears to be a contradiction , the thrust is consistent : we do not accept coups , &quot; he said . 
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said the organisation had made it clear to Burundi President Pierre Buyoya and Nigeria &apos;s Sani Abacha that their military governments had to be seen to be be making way for democracy . 
Salim , elected on Monday to an unprecedented third four-year term as secretary-general , said the OAU had sent envoys to Nigeria to tell Abacha that his regime was unacceptable . 
&quot; We are still very much committed to seeing that democracy comes to Nigeria .... A democratic Nigeria will set a very important example in Africa , &quot; he said . 
on Burundi , he said : &quot; We have made it clear to President Buyoya that his situation is not different from Sierra Leone , that it has to be attended to and that we want to see a return to democracy . 
OAU leaders came out more strongly than ever before at the Harare summit in favour of democracy throughout the continent , linking transition to popular government to economic growth and development . 
they denounced the coup in Sierra Leone and endorsed armed action by the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , led by Nigeria , to expel the military government . 
though Burundi and Nigeria were not named in open discussion and were not condemned in resolutions of the OAU &apos;s 33rd summit , Mugabe and Salim said they were under a spotlight . 
Mugabe said the OAU was putting structures in place to deal with emerging conflicts and crisis such as the Sierra Leone coup . 
&quot; Ten or so years ago we did not address , as the OAU , issues that had to do with coups d &apos;etat as such . 
we merely regretted that they had occurred . 
but now we want to address them and address them as vigourously as we can , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It may take us some time , but that is our position . 
Salim said the OAU was leaving it to the 16-nation ECOWAS group to resolve the crisis in Sierra Leone , but had offered strong moral support and had urged Africa and the world &quot; not to do anything that would give comfort to that regime . 
responding to a journalist who accused the OAU of hypocrisy in its dealings with Sierra Leone , Nigeria and Laurent Kabila &apos;s Democratic Republic of Congo , Salim said : 
the OAU increasingly is becoming involved in issues that were considered no-go areas .
