Tokyo stocks are likely to hunt for a floor this week after economic and banking sector worries spurred a loss of more than 2,000 points in the first week of the New Year . 
&quot; The Nikkei average has been crashing through barrier after barrier and now the only solid bottom is regarded at the 14,000 level , which was achieved in 1992 and 1995 , &quot; said Keiji Arai , strategist at Sanyo Securities . 
on Friday , the key Nikkei average of 225 leading shares tumbled 770.22 points or 4.26 percent to settle at 17,303.65 , the lowest close since August 1995 . 
March futures crashed 1,000 points , its maximum allowable single-day point loss , to finish at 17,150 . 
&quot; There don &apos;t seem to be any factors around to break the freefall , &quot; a trader at a second-tier brokerage said . 
&quot; The only thing which could stanch the losses would be moves by the government to rescue the stock market . 
the market , already enfeebled by the bleak outlook for economic recovery , was battered by a sell-off in the banking sector brought on by firms dissolving cross-shareholdings ahead of the fiscal year at the end of March . 
a steep slide in the stock market deals a heavy blow to banks by slashing the paper profits on the shareholdings they own , encouraging more investors to sell , brokers said . 
these unrealised profits are used to tackle the bad loans left over after the collapse of the 1980s asset bubble . 
market exasperation towards the government , which stood by and watched last week as the market shed more than 10 percent , has discouraged buyers from even bargain hunting , brokers said . 
on Friday , Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a news conference that the government was determined to carry out reforms and repeated the official view that the economy was gradually recovering , urging firms to have confidence . 
economic Planning Agency Minister Taro Aso told a separate news conference that stock prices can be determined only by the market . 
&quot; It &apos;s not for the government to interfere , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There is no immediate remedy ( to raise share prices ) , &quot; admitted top government spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama at a news conference on Friday . 
but one broker at a second-tier firm said &quot; the focus in the coming days will be if the government decides to do something about the market . 
&quot; The heavy losses sparked hopes that a rebound might ensue but many brokers said the environment was still riddled with too much uncertainty . 
they said any rebound was likely to be short-lived . 
&quot; Once it starts rebounding , recovery could be quick but the market needs a push to get it going and the inspiration is not going to come from within , &quot; one trader said . 
wall Street &apos;s recovery to yet another record high on Friday failed to inspire much enthusiasm and some analysts even found room for pessimism . 
&quot; The rise in U.S. stocks is a positive factor for the Japanese stocks but on the other hand there is a great deal of concern about how long the Dow will keep rising , &quot; said Yasuo Ueki , Nikko Securities general manager . 
&quot; Any signs of weakness in the U.S. market would cause Japanese stocks a great deal of harm , &quot; he said .
