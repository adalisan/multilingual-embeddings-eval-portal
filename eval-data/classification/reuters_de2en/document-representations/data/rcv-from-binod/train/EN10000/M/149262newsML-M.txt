German shares got the week off to a brighter start on Monday as the tension which sparked declines last week eased and a stream of positive corporate news boosted market sentiment . 
heavyweight blue chip companies including Daimler-Benz and Volkswagen led an advance which added one percent to the 30-share DAX index in early bourse dealings . 
the DAX was up 27.04 points at 2,701.26 after half an hour of floor dealings and was expected to hold around the psychologically-crucial 2,700 point level . 
&quot; This is not going to be a day for a furious advance but the phase of consolidation seems to have passed , &quot; said one Frankfurt dealer . 
Daimler-Benz was up 2.37 marks at 89.80 marks amid a positive reaction to a magazine article which said its chairman Juergen Schrempp had threatened to resign in order to force through a company restructure . 
Daimler denied the report . 
Volkswagen gained 18 marks to 601 on a report in a newspaper Monday that it planned to alter its share law , a move seen as likely to reduce regional state influence on its business . 
engineering group Deutsche Babcock rebounded strongly from weakness sparked by insolvency rumours last week , gaining six percent to 41.50 marks while chemical group Henkel rose 1.50 marks to 69 after saying it planned a full takeover of U.S. firm Loctite . 
the only decliner among blue chip shares was retailer Metro , which fell 90 pfennigs to 125.60 marks on an unconfirmed report that prosecutors were probing it for alleged irregularities in its share propspectus .
