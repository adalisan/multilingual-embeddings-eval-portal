Massachusetts , which has been waging a legal war on tobacco companies , fired another salvo on Tuesday when the state &apos;s treasurer sought legislation to divest tobacco stocks from the public pension fund . 
Massachusetts Treasurer Joe Malone , who heads the $ 17 billion public pension funds , asked the head of the state &apos;s Senate Ways and Means Committee for legislation that would allow him to sell the $ 180 million of tobacco stocks the fund holds . 
the largest holdings are in Philip Morris COS and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co , said Malone &apos;s spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom . 
Fehrnstom said the change is needed so Malone can order some of the fund &apos;s 59 portfolio managers to divest without abrogating his fiduciary responsibility . 
State Senate sources , noting the Legislature passed a 25 cents tax on each cigarette pack sold in the state last spring interrupted 
but in Florida , the staff of the State Board of Administration , which oversees the pension fund , recommended keeping the tobacco stocks in its $ 60 billion public fund portfolio because they are profitable . 
over 10 years , tobacco stocks yielded a 23 percent return , while non-tobacco stocks averaged 14.2 percent . 
the fund &apos;s new manager , Tom Herndon , agrees with the recommendation and believed the state &apos;s duty to retirees should outweigh non-fiduciary concerns .
