international Jewish leaders joined German Jewish community representatives on Monday to criticise Berlin &apos;s city parliament for deciding to suspend funding for a new museum about the Nazi terror . 
Ignatz Bubis , head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany and chairman of an international board advising the museum &apos;s developers , said Berlin had betrayed Jews by trying to delay construction work until 2000 . 
&quot; The Berlin city parliament has broken its word , &quot; Bubis told reporters in a tent on the museum &apos;s building site . 
&quot; delayed in this case is the same as cancelled . 
since the city &apos;s decision to postpone the project , Berlin mayor Eberhard Diepgen has received a flood of letters and calls from foreign Jewish organisations calling for funding to be reinstated . 
&quot; The suspension of this project sends the wrong message at the wrong time to the wrong people , &quot; leaders of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre , an international foundation against anti-Semitism , wrote in a letter to the Berlin mayor . 
&quot; We urge the immediate re-establishment of this project , fully funded , so that every young German and millions of visitors to Berlin will continue to learn the appropriate lessons from that brutal era , &quot; the letter continued . 
Sybil Milton , vice-chairwoman of the advisory board and chief historian of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington , also publicly criticised the delay when she met Berlin Jewish community leader Jerzy Kanal in the United States last week . 
Milton approved of the board &apos;s recommendations to reinstate funding for the Berlin museum , a board member told Reuters . 
she was unable to attend Monday &apos;s meeting in Berlin . 
Bubis said the federal and city governments had an obligation to ensure the museum was finished by the 60th anniversary of Kristallnacht -- November 9 , 1938 , when Nazi mobs destroyed Jewish homes and businesses . 
he also criticised delays in plans for a Holocaust victims &apos; memorial in Berlin , hit by budget cuts . 
Bubis accused the city of treating the memorial as a low priority and said : &quot; If they hadn &apos;t been killed , there would be no need for a memorial . 
he addressed statements made by Diepgen at the weekend in which he defended the city &apos;s cost-cutting measures and efforts for the Jewish community . 
&quot; German history itself is guilty here and not the Jewish community , &quot; an irate Bubis said . 
&quot; This museum is not a gift to Jews . 
the empty , grass-covered lot planned as the site of the museum was once Adolf Hitler &apos;s Gestapo and SS headquarters and served as a vast interrogation centre for the Nazi regime &apos;s enemies . 
Nazi leaders , including Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Eichmann , had offices there , from where they propagated the terror which culminated in the Holocaust .
