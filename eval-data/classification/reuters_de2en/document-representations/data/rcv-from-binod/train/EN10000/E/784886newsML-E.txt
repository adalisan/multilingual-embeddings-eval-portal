China expects the 1997 government deficit to shed 10 billion yuan ( $ 1.2 billion ) , helped by fiscal revenue growth and curbs on expenditure , the Xinhua news agency said on Thursday . 
State revenue was forecast to climb by a year-on-year 17 percent , Xinhua said . 
it attributed revenue growth to an increase in stamp revenue , tariff tax and income tax collected from profitable state enterprises and individuals . 
the State Information Centre said in a recent report revenue would account for a greater share of gross domestic product , rising by 0.4 percentage points , Xinhua said without elaborating . 
budgeted expenditure growth will also be held at 14.7 percent annually due to curbs on government spending and a freeze on construction of non-essential official buildings , Xinhua said . 
this year &apos;s low inflation has helped cut state subsidies and greatly reduce pressure on state spending , the agency said . 
it gave no further details .
