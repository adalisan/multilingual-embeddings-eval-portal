doctors for the first time have used low doses of a cancer-fighting drug to boost the immune system of people infected with the AIDS virus without any apparent side effects . 
the research , appearing on Tuesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , was based on a six-month study of 16 patients using interleukin 2 ( Il 2 ) . 
scientists in the past year have made remarkable strides in developing antiviral drugs that suppress the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS . 
those drugs target the virus . 
the interleukin research attempted to give them an ally by marshalling the body &apos;s own immune system defense . 
but the researchers at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center were very encouraged by the initial findings . 
&quot; In the entire history of medicine , we really have not been able to stimulate the immune system . 
we can suppress it -- for transplants , allergies and autoimmune diseases . 
but we didn &apos;t know how to turn it up , &quot; lead researcher Dr. Kendall Smith told Reuters in a telephone interview . 
&quot; But we achieved that ... this shows the proof of concept . 
Smith said the idea was to use Il 2 , with the other new &quot; cocktails &quot; of AIDS drugs , &quot; to treat people as early as possible , before they &apos;ve had much immune system damage . 
the anti-viral drugs may reduce HIV levels in their blood , but &quot; this may help the immune system in coming back , &quot; Smith said . 
Interleukin 2 is a hormone that is a natural part of the immune system . 
identified in the 1970s , it is used in chemotherapy against some cancers . 
but chemotherapy requires large doses and patients often have terrible side effects . 
other scientists are experimenting with chemotherapy-style Il 2 treatments for AIDS , giving large doses in the hospital for about five days at a time . 
the treatment is costly and the side effects can be severe . 
in contrast , Smith &apos;s subjects gave themselves daily shots of small doses of Il 2 , much like diabetics give themselves insulin . 
they did not have to go to the hospital and could continue normal daily school and work activities . 
the idea was to see how low a dose would be effective in raising the number of CD-4 cells in the bloodstream . 
the CD-4 count is an indicator of how healthy HIV-infected people are , how well they can stave off the virus &apos;s killer effects . 
on average , they had been HIV-infected for seven years . 
Smith &apos;s team found that doses measured at 125,000 IU was too low . 
there were no significant side effects but there were no benefits either . 
at 500,000 IU , the side effects started , including low-grade fever , muscle aches and a &quot; general bad feeling , &quot; he said . 
but at 250,000 the patients &apos; CD-4 counts rose steadily , a mean of 27 or 28 cells each month , and they had no side effects . 
&quot; The results from this study indicate that asymptomatic HIV-individuals can self-administer Il 2 safely and without any detectable toxity for six momths , &quot; the scientists wrote .
