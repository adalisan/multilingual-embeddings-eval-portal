U.S. debt futures finished a quiet session with futures on the long end up slightly and those on the short end steady to lower . 
U.S. economic data released this morning sent mixed signals to the market . 
November U.S. personal income and spending both rose 0.5 percent last month compared to forecasts for a rise of 0.6 percent in income and 0.3 percent in spending . 
the University of Michigan Consumer sentiment Index was at 96.9 compared to expectations for 99.0 . 
personal income was stronger than expected , &quot; but it didn &apos;t really do anything &quot; to the market , said Jim Collins , senior vice president at Smith Barney Harris Upham . 
Followthrough buying from oveseas also helped early , &quot; not that there was anything going on there , &quot; Collins noted . 
floor traders said buying by a large U.S. brokerage firm and local buying contributed to strength in T-bond futures , driving the March contract up near resistance between 113-21 / 32 and 113-24 / 32 . 
but activity was thin throughout the day before the holiday that starts tomorrow . 
debt futures close at noon central time Tuesday and are closed all day Wednesday for the Christmas holiday . 
at settlement , March T-bond futures were 4 / 32 point higher at 113-14 / 32 , 10-year T-notes were 1 / 32 higher at 109-22 / 32 and muni-bonds were 1 / 32 lower at 116-08 / 32 . 
March IMM T-bills were three basis points lower at 94.95 and Eurodollars were unchanged at 94.45 .
