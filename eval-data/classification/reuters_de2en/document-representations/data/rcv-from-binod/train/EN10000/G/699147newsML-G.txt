U.S. and North Korean officials will meet in New York on Wednesday , two days after Pyongyang agreed to take part in four-party talks on a Korean peninsula peace treaty , the State Department said on Tuesday . 
spokesman John Dinger said the meeting was not directly related to the four-party talks and would cover such issues as North Korea &apos;s missile policy , missing U.S. servicemen in Korea and an exchange of liaison offices . 
acting Assistant Secretary of State Charles Kartman will head the U.S. side and Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan will lead the North Korean delegation in the talks at the U.S. mission to the United Nations , Dinger told a news briefing . 
the same two officials and South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Song Yong Shik met in New York on Monday and agreed that their countries and China would hold preparatory talks Aug . 5 to fix details of the four-party negotiations . 
Dinger said he would not be surprised if North Korea , which is currently suffering from serious famine , brought up food aid issues on Wednesday . 
the United States had no plans to give any additional food aid to North Korea , but would consider any new appeal by the U.N. World Food Programme , he said . 
Dinger said the delegations to the Aug . 5 meeting were expected to be similar in composition to those that have taken part in previous meetings , with the addition of a Chinese delegation . 
&quot; The United States is prepared to be flexible and take into account the desires of the other three parties in this process , &quot; he said . 
the aim of the four-party talks , first proposed last year by the United States and South Korea , is to replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War with a permanent peace treaty .
