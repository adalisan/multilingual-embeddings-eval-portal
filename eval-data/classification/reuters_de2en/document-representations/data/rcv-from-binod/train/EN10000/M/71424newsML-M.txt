wall Street stocks should open slightly lower in thin trading on Monday , held in check until investors know more about the outcome of tomorrow &apos;s Fed meeting and by the Jewish Yom Kippur and Japanese holidays . 
&quot; It should be a dull session with a slightly downside bias , &quot; said prudential securities market analyst Hildegard Zagorski . 
&quot; The market should stay in a holding pattern ... I don &apos;t see anyone getting rambunctious before the Fed meeting . 
Tuesday , the Federal Reserve &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) will hold a meeting on interest rate policy .
