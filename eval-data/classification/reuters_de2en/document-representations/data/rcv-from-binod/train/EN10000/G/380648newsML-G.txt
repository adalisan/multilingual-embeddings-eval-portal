Islamic rebels holding 11 Russian and Western hostages have failed to release their captives as agreed under a deal with the Tajik government , a presidential spokesman said on Saturday . 
&quot; Bakhrom Sadirov has not released the hostages , &quot; the spokesman , Zafar Saidov , said . 
&quot; Their fate is unknown because from 4.30 p.m. ( 1130 GMT ) all communications with their base have been down and all attempts to restore them have failed . 
the hostages still held by the rebels include three U.N. observers -- two from Switzerland and one from Ukraine -- four workers with the U.N. refugee agency and the Tajik security minister , Saidamir Zukhurov , who was abducted last weekend when he flew in to negotiate . 
&quot; We are concerned that the fighters are preparing to withdraw ( from their base ) to the mountains and intend to take the hostages with them , &quot; Saidov said . 
under the deal mediated by Russian officials , the Tajik government flew to Tajikistan from Afghanistan 35 supporters of brothers Bakhrom and Rizvon Sadirov . 
all the fighters , apparently armed , have been freed and 
Saidov said that government troops had already been pulled closer to the base of the hostage-takers , in a mountainous area some 80 km ( 50 miles ) form the Tajik capital Dushanbe . 
a government helicopter flew over the base early this morning to reconnoitre the scene . 
by Saturday afternoon the government had released more than 30 fighters it had flown from neighbouring Afghanistan to exchange for the hostages , but the rebels failed to free their captives and broke off walkie-talkie negotiations . 
among the hostages held by the rebels are three U.N. observers -- two from Switzerland and one from Ukraine -- four workers with the U.N. refugee agency , two Russian journalists and the Tajik Security Minister Saidamir Zukhurov , who was abducted last weekend when he flew in to negotiate with the rebels . 
the hostage crisis started on February 4 , when Bakhrom Sadirov seized hostages and demanded that the government allow free passage for his brother Rizvon and some 40 of his men to his base in Tajikistan from neighbouring Afghanistan .
