Nigerian Finance Minister Anthony Ani said on Tuesday the government was ending its cap on interest rates with immediate effect . 
&quot; The de-capping takes effect this morning , &quot; he told reporters during the annual meeting of the IMF and World Bank . 
rates had previously been kept at a ceiling of 21 percent . 
Ani said the government was also ending the system of central allocation of credits . 
heavily-indebted Nigeria has been under pressure from the World Bank and IMF to end the interest rate cap , seen as protecting inefficient banks , as part of economic reforms . 
Central Bank Governor Paul Ogwuma said banks will now be allowed to set their own rates , with the government using a minimum rediscount rate and the Treasury-bill market to influence levels . 
Ogwuma said the economy was now sufficiently robust so that interest rates would not soar as they did last time the government tried to end the rate cap . 
&quot; It is unlikely that interest rates will get out of hand , &quot; he said , adding he hoped now that credit would now be more efficiently distributed to the economy . 
he noted the budget was in balance while inflation , which fell to 43.6 percent in June , was likely to drop to 25 to 30 percent by the year-end . 
he predicted that economic growth would be at least 6 to 7 percent next year from this year &apos;s likely 4 to 5 percent . 
the government was trying to create an increasingly favourable investment climate , pointing to plans to sell the government &apos;s controlling stake in oil joint-ventures over the next five years , Finance Minister Ani said . 
he also expects to eventually get rid of the dual exchange rate which sets the naira at around 20 to the dollar compared to a commercial rate of around 80 . 
the reason for making the announcement in Washington was to send the right signals to the international community that Nigeria was prepared to keep its word , he added .
