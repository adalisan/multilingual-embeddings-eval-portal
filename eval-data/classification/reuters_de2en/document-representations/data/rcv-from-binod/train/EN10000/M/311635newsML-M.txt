Mexican stocks closed mixed Thursday after late profit-taking on blue chips dragged the market down from an intraday record . 
&quot; The market is only regulating its upward velocity with this sort of profit-taking . 
the slide could continue to suit bargain hunters , &quot; said an equity analyst from the Finamex brokerage . 
the leading IPC share index closed down 26.19 points , or 0.70 percent , at 3,701.83 . 
volume was very heavy at 148.8 million shares traded , although not as spectacular as on Wednesday . 
the IPC earlier rose to a record intraday high at 3,753.18 points . 
&quot; There were clear sell signals at 3,750 points . 
that &apos;s where dealers stepped out , when their stocks had reached target prices , &quot; the analyst added . 
traders said high volume was a sign that foreign investors were still interested in Mexico . 
&quot; Foreigners are still interested in Mexico ; you can see confidence in the volume traded , &quot; said a trader from the Abaco brokerage . 
on the broad market , of 121 stocks that changed hands , gainers outnumbered sliders by 56 to 46 . 
market heavyweight Telmex was among the sliders , closing down 46 centavos ( 6 cents ) at 15.04 pesos ( $ 1.92 ) , and helped to outweigh gains by othe stocks included in the IPC . 
Pharamaceutical firm Bevides headed the gainers up 1.02 pesos ( 13 cents ) to 13.30 ( $ 1.70 ) , after lagging behind the market and due to a recent acquisition , traders said . 
debt-ridden autoparts maker Iasasa headed the sliders &apos; list , down three centavos ( 1 cent ) to 29 centavos ( 4 cents ) , followed by financial group Abaco , off 16 centavos ( 2 cents ) at 1.88 pesos ( 24 cents ) . 
&quot; Abaco is not a very liquid stock and its share price , like others , has been very volatile in the wake of the recent rally , &quot; one broker said .
