Afghanistan &apos;s Islamic Taleban militia launched a major air and ground offensive on Tuesday against opposition forces controlling key towns north of the capital Kabul , a Pakistan-based Afghan news service said . 
the Afghan Islamic Press ( AIP ) quoted a Taleban spokesman as saying Taleban fighters were advancing towards the strategic town of Jabal os-Siraj , 70 km ( 44 miles ) north of Kabul , held by opposition guerrilla chief Ahmad Shah Masood . 
at the same time , Taleban warplanes bombed opposition positions in the nearby town of Golbahar , at the gateway to Masood &apos;s Panjsher Valley stronghold , the spokesman said . 
he said fighting was also raging around the town of Khenjan , 60 km ( 37 miles ) north of Jabal os-Siraj , between a Taleban force stranded in the town of Pul-i-Khumri further north and an opposition Ismaili militia that controls Khenjan . 
the militia is led by an independent commander , Syed Jafar Naderi , who held Pul-i-Khumri until the Taleban captured it last Wednesday , only to find themselves hemmed in by hostile forces . 
opposition militias have been closing in on the Taleban force , which was cut off from its Kabul supply lines when Masood &apos;s fighters took Jabal os-Siraj on Friday , blocking the main Salang highway to the north across the Hindu Kush range . 
a Reuters correspondent in Pul-i-Khumri , Tim Johnston , said the town itself was quiet on Tuesday , a day after the Taleban retreated on front lines north and south of the town . 
a Taleban commander said the Islamic militia had ceded the town of Doshi , 46 km ( 29 miles ) south of Pul-i-Khumri , to Naderi &apos;s forces on Monday , and had pulled back about 15 km ( nine miles ) to a new front line 35 km ( 22 miles ) north of the town . 
the Taleban swept across the north after an ethnic Uzbek opposition leader , General Abdul Malik , defected on May 19 , allowing them to capture the northern capital of Mazar-i-Sharif . 
but four days after Mazar-i-Sharif fell , Malik turned on his new allies and drove them out of the city last Wednesday in fierce street battles in which at least 100 people were killed . 
the Taleban have responded by sending thousands of new recruits to Kabul , many of them young religious students from Koranic schools in Pakistan and southern Afghanistan .
