two New Hampshire high school students were under suspension Thursday after the Secret Service traced a computer mail death threat they allegedly sent to President Clinton over the Internet . 
the two 10th graders from profile High School in Bethlehem sent the threat Jan . 13 , Secret Service agent James Fitton said from his Concord , New Hampshire , office . 
Bethlehem School superintendent Robert Horan said the students claimed they never expected the message to reach the president . 
but the message not only arrived at a White House web site , its contents were intercepted by the Secret Service , which traced it back to a profile High School computer lab . 
the students were suspended shortly after the incident until the end of the month and have been banned from logging on to the school &apos;s Internet computer server for the rest of their high school years . 
Federal officials say they doubt criminal charges will be filed . 
&quot; We &apos;re satisfied the school took appropriate action against the students , &quot; Fitton said . 
the incident is the third time Clinton has been threatened via computer mail or e-mail from New Hampshire by students during the past three months , Fitton said . 
two juveniles from Keene and Salem also made cyber-threats , he said .
