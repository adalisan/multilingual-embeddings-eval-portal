former Tennessee governor and three-term congressman Ray Blanton , who served a prison sentence for extortion , died Friday , a spokesman said . 
Blanton , 66 , died at a hospital in Jackson after suffering a heart attack , according to brooks Parker , his former press secretary . 
doctors had been planning to move him to a medical facility in Memphis when he died . 
a Democrat , Blanton held a House seat for six years before serving as governor from 1975 to 1979 . 
he was defeated for reelection by Republican Lamar Alexander and forced from office by state officials who swore Alexander into office early , alleging Blanton was dispensing pardons to criminals indiscriminately in his final days in office . 
in 1980 he and two aides were indicted on charges they provided liquor licenses to friends in the Nashville area in exchange for profits from the resulting business . 
one store owner testified that he paid Blanton $ 23,000 to obtain a liquor license . 
Blanton had denied doing anything wrong , once telling a newspaper he &quot; never took a dishonest dollar in my life . 
that should tell you something . 
last summer the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cinncinnati turned down his request to get the conviction reversed . 
the panel upheld a lower court ruling which had rejected his argument that he had been ineffectively represented by the lawyer who handled his trial . 
Blanton served nearly two years of a three-year conviction on extortion and conspiracy charges . 
in later years he sold cars and worked in the construction business .
