the deputy head of the International Monetary Fund meets Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in Moscow on Friday to discuss how to stimulate growth and talk about economic policies for 1997 . 
Thomas Wolf , the IMF &apos;s chief representative in Russia , said Fischer &apos;s informal visit had several aims . 
&quot; The aim of the visit is to discuss with the authorities policies in respect of consolidating macroeconomic stabilisation and formulating policies conducive to stimulating economic growth , &quot; Wolf said . 
the Russian economy has yet to recover from a prolonged slump in industrial output which started before the Soviet Union fell apart . 
but officials expect growth to start this year . 
an IMF mission arrived in Moscow earlier this week to discuss Russia &apos;s latest economic data and help draw up policy plans for 1997 . 
Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vlyugin said on Thursday that he expected final agreement on the 1997 programme next month . 
Russia and the IMF reached agreement for a three-year $ 10 billion loan last year , but the IMF delayed handing over two tranches of the loan at the end of the year because it was worried about low Russian tax revenues . 
lending has now resumed and if the current mission is satisfied with the figures it could recommend paying one or more tranches of the loan .
