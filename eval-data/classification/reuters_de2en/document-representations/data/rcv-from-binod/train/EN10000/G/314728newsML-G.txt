the Peruvian government and Marxist rebels holding 74 hostages in Lima clashed angrily on Thursday over how to end the 30-day crisis , trading accusations of manipulation and bad faith . 
government negotiator Domingo Palermo rejected a rebel proposal that the Guatemalan government take part in talks to end the stand-off , and said Red Cross and family visits to jailed members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) had been cut off . 
rebel leader Nestor Cerpa Cartolini , replying in a megaphone tirade from the besieged residence of the Japanese ambassador in Lima , said the government was creating obstacles to solving the crisis . 
he ruled out more hostage releases any time soon . 
&quot; The Peruvian government does not accept the proposal that a representative of the Guatemalan government take part in the commission , &quot; Palermo told a news conference . 
the government considered that trying to bring the Central American country into the talks was an effort by the rebels to suggest a similarity between the situation in Peru and the recently-ended civil war in Guatemala . 
leftist guerrillas there laid down arms in December after more than 30 years of fighting . 
&quot; With this suggestion the aim is to establish an analogy with a completely different reality , &quot; Palermo said . 
the Peruvian government says the rebel hostage takers , who stormed the residence of the Japanese ambassador on Dec . 17 during a cocktail party , are &quot; terrorists &quot; who have no support among the population . 
it rejects any comparison between Central American guerrilla conflicts of the 1980s and early 1990s and the Peruvian government &apos;s fight against the MRTA and the Maoist Shining Path movement . 
the rebels had suggested on Wednesday that Guatemala and an unnamed European country join a &quot; guarantor commission &quot; proposed by the government to try to end the hostage crisis . 
both sides have agreed to the participation of representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Vatican . 
Cerpa attempted to reply to Palermo with a statement read to reporters by walkie-talkie but was barely intelligible due to heavy distortion . 
police had earlier broken on to the frequency used by the rebels and reporters at the scene suspected the transmission was being jammed by authorities . 
Cerpa then used a megaphone to shout a statement . 
&quot; For now , there are no releases , &quot; Cerpa said . 
Cerpa asked for the visits by the Red Cross and relatives of MRTA prisoners in government jails to be resumed , saying a sign of &quot; good will &quot; was needed from the government of President Alberto Fujimori . 
&quot; We think that only in this way can a suitable atmosphere be created for beginning dialogue , &quot; Cerpa said . 
&quot; We hope there is good will from the government so that by Feb . 17 ( Peruvian Foreign Minister ) Francisco Tudela will be out &quot; . 
Tudela , the prize hostage of the rebels , had been due to attend a crucial round of peace talks in Rio de Janeiro on Feb . 17 to try and resolve Peru and Ecuador &apos;s bitter border dispute , which led to a brief war in 1995 . 
the government has said it hopes Tudela will be out in time for that meeting , but the rebel statement did not appear to be a formal offer to let him go . 
Palermo said the visits to MRTA prisoners were being suspended &quot; in order to avoid disturbing the process of talks &quot; but did not explain how such visits had been doing so . 
Cerpa specifically asked for visits to be resumed to imprisoned MRTA leader Victor Polay Campos . 
Palermo said the government was evaluating the rest of the rebel proposal . 
he did not say whether the government would accept the participation of a European country in the talks . 
the rebels are demanding that the government free some 400 of their jailed MRTA colleagues . 
Fujimori has flatly refused that demand but says he is prepared to let the rebels leave Peru if they lay down their arms and free all their hostages . 
the rebels originally took more than 500 hostages at the residence but have freed most of them . 
the remaining 74 captives in the mined and booby-trapped residence include two Peruvian ministers , the Japanese and Bolivian ambassadors , about two dozen Japanese businessmen and Fujimori &apos;s brother Pedro .
