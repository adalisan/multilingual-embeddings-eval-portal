German Bernhard Langer claimed his second successive European Tour title when he won the rain-hit Benson and hedges International by two strokes from Ian Woosnam of Britain on Sunday . 
it was a supreme display of golf by Langer in the most testing of conditions which saw play twice suspended because of lightning and torrential rain . 
Langer , winner of the Italian Open last weekend , had a final round 69 to finish on 12-under-par 276 . 
Woosnam had a 70 for 278 with Briton Lee Westwood third a further two strokes back on 280 after a 72 . 
Woosnam &apos;s chances looked to have disappeared when he double-bogeyed the par four 10th . 
but he pulled a shot back at the next and finished in marvellous style with birdies on four of the last five holes . 
Westwood , after lying second for most of the round , saw his hopes perish on the 585-yard 17th when he went into the water and took a bogey six .
