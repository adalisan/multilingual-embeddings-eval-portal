Singapore shares drifted lower on Tuesday as investors stayed sidelined and trade remained stifled by better opportunities elsewhere , dealers said . 
&quot; Fund managers have downgraded this market and there &apos;s been a fair bit of forced-selling , fund-switching , &quot; a dealer with a Singapore brokerage said . 
institutions were quietly watching developments in Hong Kong on the first day of its return to Chinese rule , he said . 
at the lunch break , the Straits Times Industrials Index ( STII ) was down 8.20 points at 1,979.75 . 
volume was a weak 44 million shares with losers outpacing gainers 146 to 79 . 
the bulk of activity was seen confined to China-linked Tianjin Zhongxin Pharmaceutical , wing Tai and Van der Horst . 
Tianjin eased to US $ 1.10 , down five cents on profit taking after recent strong gains on handover speculation , and wing Tai saw four million lots crossed off the market at S $ 4.16 , up four cents . 
Malaysian multi-purpose drew some interest after a bout of selling on Monday .
