KCBT hard red winter wheat futures ended mixed and the December contract closed at a two-month high , extending gains late after hitting buy stops toward the close , traders said . 
&quot; It started off weaker because of the poor close we saw last night , but buying came in outright in the December while Cargill continued to be a seller of March , &quot; a KCBT trader said . 
&quot; Then on the close we saw ... buying after some small buy stops were hit . 
traders said the December / March inversion widened again as a result of short covering . 
the spread traded late at 43 cents , up from its close Thursday at 39 cents . 
KCBT wheat closed five cents per bushel lower to 7-1 / 2 cents higher , with Dec up 7-1 / 2 cents at $ 4.47-1 / 2 a bushel . 
the last time Dec closed higher was on Sept . 10 , when it closed at $ 4.52 per bushel . 
Cargill bought at least one million December bushels and one million March but also sold 2.6 million March . 
prudential bought 1.2 million Dec , sold one million March and bear-spread one million March / Dec at 38 to 40 cents . 
prudential also bull-spread two million March / July at 28 to 30 cents . 
&quot; Cargill is perceived short ( wheat ) at the Gulf , so it would make sense that they &apos;d be bidding for Dec wheat , &quot; a trader said .
