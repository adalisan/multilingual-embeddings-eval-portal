British trade figures due on Wednesday will probably show the trade deficit with the rest of the world widened in December , according to a Reuters poll of economists . 
their consensus estimate was for a December trade gap of 1.014 billion stg after a November shortfall of 959 million . 
the December global trade data will be released on Wednesday at 0930 GMT at the same time as January figures for trade with non-European Union countries . 
January trade with EU nations will be included in the January global figures due in March . 
economists said last month &apos;s figures showed a surprise fall in exports . 
they will watch keenly to see if that phenomenon has continued . 
&quot; While we do expect sterling &apos;s rise to depress export growth , this will take some time to work through , &quot; said Ciaran Barr , UK economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
&quot; accordingly , we expect a modest rebound in non-EU export levels in this month &apos;s data . 
the Reuter poll has an estimate of 793 million stg for Britain &apos;s non-EU trade deficit in January , down from 844 million in December . 
the pound has risen about 16 percent on a trade-weighted basis since last August . 
as a currency appreciates it cuts import prices and raises export prices . 
with trade volumes slow to react to price changes , the trade gap will narrow , in value terms , in the short-run -- the so-called J curve . 
but as price changes shift the dynamics of supply and demand , the strong pound will eventually force a deterioration of Britain &apos;s trade position as export markets shy away from the higher prices imposed by the pound . 
the reverse , of course , applies to imports which look ever cheaper to the now confident British consumer . 
&quot; Once the beneficial impact of sterling upon export and import prices has washed through the system we anticipate a marked widening in the deficit as the loss of competitiveness feeds through into volumes , &quot; said David Philpotts , UK economist at Schroders . 
Barr agreed that the underlying trend in 1997 will be for higher trade deficits . 
for Britain &apos;s global trade gap , Philpotts said the fall in import prices was already being more than offset by an acceleration in import volumes . 
he noted that the non-EU trade deficit widened by 145 million pounds to 844 million in December and forecast a global trade deficit of 1.2 billion stg this time . 
Philpotts said evidence from the Confederation of British Industry suggested export volumes improved slightly in the New Year . 
the CBI &apos;s monthly industrial trends survey showed the balance of manufacturers reporting falling exports in December was minus 15 percent -- i.e. 
15 percent more firms said exports fell than said they rose . 
that figure fell to minus eight percent in the January survey but widened back out to minus 12 in February . 
&quot; With import penetration rising strongly , we are sceptical whether there will be any improvement in the non-EU trade deficit in January , &quot; Philpotts said .
