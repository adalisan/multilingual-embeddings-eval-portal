Russia could face problems over payment of an International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) loan in November unless budget revenues show signs of improvement , Finance Minister Alexander Livshits was quoted as saying on Friday . 
a Fund mission monitoring Russia &apos;s economic performance left without reaching a conclusion on whether the latest tranche of the $ 10 billion three-year loan should be paid . 
&quot; Problems with the IMF tranches may arise in November if there is not a positive dynamic in budget revenues , &quot; he was quoted as saying by Prime-Tass news agency . 
&quot; The same thing worries the IMF as worries us -- federal budget revenues . 
they want from us the same as we want from ourselves -- a normal budget . 
the IMF delayed a payment of some $ 300 million earlier this year but eventually handed over the money . 
Prime-Tass quoted Livshits as saying government changes to the draft 1997 budget were aimed at strengthening the part of it dealing with investment . 
expenditure on production for export and on conversion of military industry was being increased .
