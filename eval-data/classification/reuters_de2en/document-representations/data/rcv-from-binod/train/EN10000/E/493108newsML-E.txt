Swedish bank Handelsbanken , which recently bought an Estonian brokerage company , on Tuesday said that Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia were on a steady growth path of around five percent or more in the medium-term . 
in a research note , Handelsbanken said that the three Baltic countries have followed tight fiscal policies with falling inflation but needed to press ahead with structural reforms . 
&quot; Over the medium term , all three countries should grow at a rate of five percent or above , &quot; Handelsbanken analyst Gunnar Termsan said in the report . 
the three countries are expected to have achieved growth of between three ane four percent last year . 
he said that although expansion in the Baltics was being driven by market forces , the institutional and legal framework was still imperfect and some scepticism may be necessary . 
&quot; Looking ahead , there is a need for a number of other strutural reforms with regard to the pensions systems , trade policy and the energy and agricultural sectors , &quot; he added . 
&quot; In the longer run , growth will only be sustained through letting markets work efficiently and all is not yet in place to make this happen , &quot; Tersman said . 
he also pinpointed the privatisation of land and improved corporate governance . 
he also forecast that inflation would be below 10 percent by the end of the year in all three countries . 
&quot; This must be characterised as big success and proof that the basic approach with stable exchange rates has worked , &quot; he said .
