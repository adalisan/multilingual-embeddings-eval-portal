December Brent gained more than a dollar as heating oil led a strong rally , quickly followed by NYMEX unleaded gasoline . 
&quot; There &apos;s no real news out there but with the weather still cold in the U.S. and with the API &apos;s out tonight everyone is nervous of being short , &quot; one broker said . 
another broker pointed to remarks made by Iraq &apos;s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva that Iraq hoped to &quot; clear the air &quot; with the United States now that President Clinton was re-elected . 
the ambassador also said that President Saddam Hussein would not sit idly by and see Iraqi people suffer if he lost hope that Gulf War sanctions would be lifted . 
&quot; It sounded aggressive and I think people are seeing Iraqi crude further away again , &quot; he said . 
&quot; That &apos;s fighting talk , &quot; one wet Brent trader said . 
as NYMEX heating oil broke up through stops brokers said good fund buying emerged bringing Brent December easily through resistance at $ 23.65 a barrel . 
in the last few minutes of trade the contract , which expires on Thursday , broke briefly up to resistance at $ 23.92 . 
December ended the day up $ 1.02 at $ 23.85 a barrel . 
December gas oil closed earlier up $ 5.50 at $ 216.50 a tonne . 
the contract was called to open on Thursday three dollars firmer - bringing it above a technical gap between $ 216.50-218 a tonne . 
&quot; This has been a good strong close and all eyes will be on the API &apos;s tonight , &apos; another broker said . 
&quot; If the API &apos;s are not bullish we have a long way to fall , &quot; he added . 
traders estimated that the weekly U.S. stock figures from the API will show a distillate build of 0.5-1 million barrels .
