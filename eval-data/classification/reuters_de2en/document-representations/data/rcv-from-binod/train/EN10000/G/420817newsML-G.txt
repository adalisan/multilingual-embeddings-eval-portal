Albanian insurgents seized an army tank in the southern port town of Sarande on Wednesday and were driving it gleefully through the streets , eyewitnesses said . 
a Reuters photographer said hundreds of heavily armed insurgents had set up a defence line in the hills at the entrance to the town , saying they were determined to fight to the finish with regular army units . 
anti-government riots swept southern Albania at the weekend and rioters seized an array of weapons from state arsenals . 
they also looted stores and burned down warehouses . 
about 300 to 400 insurgents on the Sarande hilltop carried assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades and had dug in with anti-aircraft guns and heavy machineguns . 
&quot; Neither ( President Sali ) Berisha nor the army will pass us without a fight to the finish , &quot; one of the rebels on the hilltop told a Reuters photographer . 
Sarande is on the coast near the Greek border .
