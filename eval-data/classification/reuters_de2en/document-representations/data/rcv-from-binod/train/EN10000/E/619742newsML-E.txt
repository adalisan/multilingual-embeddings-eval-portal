the Yugoslav trade deficit could reach $ 2.6 billion this year if the monthly gap stays at $ 117.7 million , the average for January-April , said Belgrade-based Market Research Institute ( IZIT ) on Wednesday . 
&quot; The trade deficit is still on the rise but there is a slow-down tendency , &quot; said IZIT &apos;s expert Snezana Popovcic-Avric . 
the accumulated January-April trade gap stood at $ 653 million with exports worth $ 677 million and imports $ 1.33 billion . 
April trade gap dropped to only $ 58 million from $ 113 million in March . 
exports in April rose 3.8 percent on the previous month and stood at $ 184 million , up 19.3 percent on April 1996 . 
imports dropped by 39.2 percent against March to $ 242 million , down 13 percent on April last year . 
IZIT &apos;s trade gap forecast of $ 2.6 billion is well above the government &apos;s plan to keep the deficit close to $ 2 billion by boosting exports by 48 percent and imports by 20 percent . 
the federal statistics office earlier this month said it did not expect the trade gap to exceed $ 1.5 billion . 
in 1996 , Yugoslavia recorded a trade deficit of $ 2.26 billion , with exports worth $ 1.84 billion and imports $ 4.1 billion .
