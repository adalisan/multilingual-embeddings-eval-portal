Israel and the PLO concluded a long-elusive agreement on Wednesday extending Palestinian rule to Hebron in the West Bank , Israeli and PLO officials said . 
the deal was reached by negotiators behind closed doors at the Erez crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip less than two hours after the start of a late-night summit between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat . 
&quot; The agreement has been signed a few minutes ago by ( negotiators ) Dan Shomron and Saeb Erekat , &quot; Netanyahu &apos;s spokesman Shai Bazak told reporters at the Erez crossing . 
PLO officials said under the agreement Israeli troops would withdraw from 80 percent of Hebron with 10 days . 
they said a formal ceremony would be held on Friday with European , Arab and American participation . 
Bazak said the deal would be brought before Israel &apos;s cabinet for approval later on Wednesday . 
the agreement was the culmination of months of difficult negotiations mediated by U.S. envoy Dennis Ross who earlier this week was on the verge of leaving the region over a deadlock in the talks . 
&quot; I am very pleased to announce on behalf of the two leaders that they have reached an agreement , &quot; Ross told reporters as Netanyahu and Arafat emerged from their negotiations . 
the two leaders shook hands but did not speak to reporters . 
Ross said the agreement included an American &quot; note for the record &quot; which dealt with future Israeli redeployments from the West Bank and other non-Hebron related issues . 
&quot; These two documents represent a very important building block in terms of developing the relations between the two sides and in terms of laying out a pathway of greater hope and the possibility for peace in the Middle East , &quot; Ross said . 
after the deal was concluded , Netanyahu and Arafat spoke by phone with U.S. President Bill Clinton , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan &apos;s King Hussein , Bazak said . 
President Clinton and President Mubarak and King Hussein phoned to congratulate them , &quot; he told reporters . 
Hebron , a West Bank flashpoint , is home to 400 militant Jewish settlers and 100,000 Arabs . 
it was due to be given self-rule 10 months ago but violence , security concerns and Israel &apos;s change of government in June delayed the pullback . 
by sealing the Hebron deal Netanyahu did what he and his right-wing Likud party said they would never do -- cede part of the biblical Land of Israel to Palestinians . 
in Jerusalem , nearly 200 settler leaders who oppose the Hebron deal called on members of Netanyahu &apos;s cabinet to vote against it . 
&quot; The agreement is a suicide pact , &quot; David wilder , a spokesman for Hebron &apos;s settlers , told Reuters . 
&quot; It &apos;s like having somebody hold a gun to your head and having somebody else helping to pull the trigger . 
at least seven of 18 cabinet members have said they will oppose the agreement when it comes up for government approval . 
&quot; Most ministers will vote for it .
