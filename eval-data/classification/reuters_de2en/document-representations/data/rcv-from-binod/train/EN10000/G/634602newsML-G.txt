Sri Lankan troops resumed their offensive against Tamil Tiger separatists early on Tuesday , pushing deeper into the rebels &apos; northern Wanni stronghold , military officials in the north said . 
troops , backed by tanks and artillery , broke out of their defences at Nedunkeni and began heading southwest towards the rebel-held town of Puliyankulam , they said . 
the army captured Nedunkeni , 40 km ( 25 miles ) northeast of the government-controlled frontline town of Vavuniya , and Omanthai , 14 km ( nine miles ) north of Vavuniya , after a massive offensive launched last month . 
Vavuniya is 220 km ( 135 miles ) north of the capital Colombo . 
troops , which earlier advanced on another flank to capture Omanthai , continued to fortify the area just north of that town , military officials said . 
a military spokesman in Colombo refused to say if troops had recommenced their advance . 
he said he was awaiting fresh details from the north . 
troops resumed their drive into the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam &apos;s ( LTTE ) northern heartland after a six-day pause to consolidate in freshly captured areas , the officials in the north said . 
the LTTE , fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in mainly Sinhalese Sri Lanka &apos;s north and east , have said troops had become bogged down by the fierce resistance put up by the rebels . 
a statement issued by the LTTE &apos;s international office in London said Sri Lankan troops continued to fire artillery towards Tamil villages from Omanthai , rendering thousands of people homeless . 
independent confirmation of the events is not possible as international media are not allowed into the battle zone . 
residents of Vavuniya told Reuters the town &apos;s calm was shattered on Tuesday morning by ambulances arriving with casualties from the north . 
aircraft were also seen heading past Vavuniya towards the battlefront , they said . 
two army divisions , consisting of about 20,000 troops , launched Operation Jaya Sikuru , or &quot; sure of Victory &quot; , from Vavuniya on May 13 in a bid to open a supply route to the Jaffna peninsula , 100 km ( 60 miles ) further north . 
the LTTE have accused Colombo of killing Tamil civilians and destroying their property under the pretext of opening a supply route . 
meanwhile , the LTTE &apos;s clandestine Voice of Tigers radio said on Tuesday the rebels had ambushed and killed nine policemen in eastern Batticaloa district on Monday . 
the radio said the rebels had ambushed a police patrol in Valachchenai , north of Batticaloa , some 300 km ( 187.5 miles ) east of Colombo . 
military officials in the east confirmed the attack . 
the government says more than 50,000 people have been killed since the war began in 1983 . 
the rebels say the toll is higher .
