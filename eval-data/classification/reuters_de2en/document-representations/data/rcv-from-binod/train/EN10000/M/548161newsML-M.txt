Israeli shares closed slightly lower on Tuesday in mixed and dull trading which traders said reflected a market mired in a mood of uncertainty . 
the benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares fell 0.23 percent , or 0.58 points , to 251.52 on all-share turnover of 90 million shekels against 91 million shekels on Thursday , the last day of trading before the Jewish holiday of Passover . 
the Maof 25 blue chip index closed 0.18 percent lower at 261.89 . 
&quot; The market was mixed and selective as investors wait to see where the economy is going , &quot; said Amir Eyal of Epsilon Securities . 
&quot; It is not clear what will happen with inflation and if the economy is slowing down . 
there are many contradicting indicators and we need more information , &quot; he said . 
Yigal Mizrahi , chief analyst at Nesuah Trading and Investments , said : &quot; Investors are sitting on the fence waiting for further developments on the political and economic front . 
Mizrahi said the government , hit recently by a corruption scandal that threatened the ruling coalition of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , is &quot; busy with its problems &quot; and has no time to deal with the economy . 
&quot; The fact that the market remained at the same level despite all the uncertainty shows that the trend is still positive , &quot; Mizrahi said . 
traders said investors remained indifferent to the Bank of Israel &apos;s decision on Thursday to leave its key lending rate unchanged at 13.9 percent in May . 
&quot; The market did not expect a rate cut and the central bank &apos;s decision had no impact on trading , &quot; Eyal said . 
Electra Consumer Products fell 0.25 percent to 1,935 agorot . 
Sahar Securities and Investments maintained its hold recommendation for Electra , saying the air conditioner maker will recover slowly from a weak 1996 fourth quarter . 
the most active shares were Teva Pharmaceutical Industries , which fell 2.25 percent to 16,786 agorot on volume of 9.6 million shekels ; Israel Discount Bank , which dropped 1.25 percent to 343 agorot on volume of 6.8 million shekels ; and Koor Industries which slid 2.75 percent to 28,992 agorot on volume of 5.4 million shekels .
