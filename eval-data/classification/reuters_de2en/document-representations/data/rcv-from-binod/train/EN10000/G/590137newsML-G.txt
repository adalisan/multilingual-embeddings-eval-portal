Turkish forces backed by tanks on Friday dug in south of the main Iraqi border town of Zakho and pushed south into the nearby mountains in the third day of their big cross-border operation . 
but there were increasing signs their quarry -- separatist rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) -- had largely fled for the safety of neighbouring Syria and Iran . 
others apparently made their way south from the Kurdish &quot; safe haven &quot; and crossed into Iraqi-government territory . 
foreign aid workers said they had seen at least 30 tanks and 60 troop carriers heading south of Zakho toward the provincial capital Dohuk . 
they reported no signs of fresh fighting . 
truck drivers and other travellers said the area was calm and the sounds of fighting at the start of the campaign on Wednesday had given way to calm , amid tight security . 
the Turkish operation -- the biggest in two years and involving at least 10,000 troops -- has linked up with peshmerga guerrillas of the local Kurdistan Democratic Party to oust the rival PKK from their bases . 
KDP forces were joined by Turkish army units at checkpoints in and around Zakho , and journalists were prevented from going anywhere near the operations . 
U.N. guards in Zakho , reached by satellite telephone , said the area was quiet . 
there were no reports of fresh clashes . 
the local population -- and even some senior KDP figures -- appeared uneasy at the big Turkish presence . 
&quot; We know the Turks certainly do not have our own interests at heart . 
truck drivers crossing into Turkey said local people were angry that Massoud Barzani , head of the KDP , was cooperating with the Turks , Reuters correspondent Osman Senkul reported from the Turkish-Iraqi border crossing . 
&quot; They have come again , with Barzani &apos;s support , but they will go home empty-handed , &quot; said one driver , summing up what he said was the mood of many Iraqis in the predominantly Kurdish north . 
the anti-Baghdad Iraqi National Congress told Reuters their contacts in the region indicated most PKK rebels had fled south , well out of range of Turkish patrols . 
&quot; We are now sure that PKK forces have crossed over into Iraqi government-controlled territory at Shekan , &quot; said an Inc spokesman in London , citing satellite telephone links to Iraq . 
at least 16 PKK members were killed in the fighting , they said . 
the incursion was carried out under a &quot; news blackout &quot; , with reporters barred and calls blocked from Turkey to satellite telephones inside Iraq . 
confirmation of casualty reports , as well as the full scope of operations , was impossible . 
however , the army reopened the border , closed since just before the attack , to deliveries of food and other supplies under United Nations auspices . 
traders with Iraqi passports were also permitted to pass . 
military officials in Diyarbakir , headquarters for the anti-PKK fight , had earlier reported heavy fighting in the Sinaht Valley , east of Zakho . 
they said one member of Turkey &apos;s Kurdish militia was killed and four were wounded in the clashes . 
state-paid village guards from the southeast often join the army on operations in Iraq . 
the general staff said late on Thursday 87 PKK rebels had been killed in Turkey &apos;s border provinces of Sirnak and Hakkari as they fled the Turkish advance from positions inside Iraq .
