leftist rebels were thought to have killed at least 11 members of a rival right-wing paramilitary gang in an ambush in northwest Colombia on Sunday , a town mayor said . 
the attack took place near the town of Anori in trouble-torn Antioquia province , one of the most violent areas of the country . 
Mayor Rafael Augusto Ospina told Reuters that five bodies had been brought into the main town but said that witnesses reported the bodies of another six paramilitary fighters were still in the tangled wreckage of the vehicle in which they had been travelling . 
&quot; People have reported 11 dead . 
what is sure is that here in the village we have five bodies of those that died in the attack against a paramilitary group . 
we &apos;re now waiting for others to arrrive , &quot; Ospina told Reuters by phone . 
&quot; The bodies were badly mutilated and almost destroyed ... we don &apos;t know which subversive group was responsible for the attack , &quot; he said , adding that the guerrillas had blown up the paramilitary gang &apos;s truck as it passed along a dirt road about 20 miles ( 30 km ) outside Anori . 
Anori , a town of about 3,200 people , lies in the northeastern part of Antioquia . 
the mainstays of the local economy are small-scale mining , sugar cane , cattle and subsistence farming . 
Ospina said members of the so-called Self-Defence Group of Cordoba and Uraba ( ACCU ) , Colombia &apos;s most-feared paramilitary gang , are known to operate in the region . 
but he said he did not know whether the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) , set up as a pro-Soviet force in 1964 , or the smaller Cuban-inspired National Liberation Army ( ELN ) , was the main guerrilla force in the area . 
the ACCU and associated paramilitary groups launched a campaign to &quot; win back &quot; much of northern Colombia from leftist guerrillas in the latter half of last year . 
that led to a number of attacks against civilians suspected of backing the rebels . 
direct clashes between the guerrillas and paramilitary members are still relatively rare , however . 
at a secret meeting in April , Colombia &apos;s main paramilitary groups formed an alliance known as the United Self-Defence groups of Colombia ( AUC ) and pledged to step up attacks against rebels and leftist sympathisers . 
a paramilitary gang massacred at least 30 people , including some local Communist Party members , in a remote village in eastern Colombia last weekend . 
army intellegence warned of a possible backlash of retaliation by rebel groups , lending weight to the theory that Sunday &apos;s attack could be the start of a counter-offensive by the guerrillas .
