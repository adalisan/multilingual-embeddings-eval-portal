third World nations meeting in Costa Rica on Monday called on their industrialised counterparts to help find a solution to the developing world &apos;s foreign debt woes . 
the call came during the first day of a summit of the Group of 77 ( G-77 ) , the developing world &apos;s counterpart to the G-7 alliance of wealthy nations . 
China , not a G-77 member , is also taking part in the summit aimed at boosting cooperation in trade and investment . 
another 55 countries sent delegates . 
Tariq Sayeed of Pakistan , president of the G-77 &apos;s Chamber of Trade and Industry , told poor nations during the summit &apos;s inaugural ceremony that their collective foreign debt totalled $ 1.7 trillion and was their single biggest problem . 
Sayeed urged the countries to lower their debt loads by complying with their U.N.-backed commitment to dedicate at least 0.7 percent of their Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) to debt service . 
G-77 President Daudi N. Mwakawago of Tanzania told the conference 40 percent to 60 percent of the export earnings from poor countries goes toward paying off foreign debts . 
&quot; Foreign debt persists as an obstacle to development , &quot; Mwakawago said , adding that it was a problem also shared by rich countries and international financiers who have an interest in finding a solution . 
&quot; The South ( countries in the southern hemisphere ) is confronting the consequences of economic globalization and the G-77 in particular should adopt new strategies for facing up to these challenges , &quot; Mwakawago said . 
cooperation among southern countries was key , he said . 
host President Jose Maria Figueres of Costa Rica said the G-77 should serve as a forum to help poor countries deal with their common problems of poverty , education , health care , environmental destruction and corruption . 
&quot; Nobody knows us better , &quot; Figueres told the nearly 500 delegates from 132 countries . 
&quot; We should be able to compete with the intellect of our own people .
