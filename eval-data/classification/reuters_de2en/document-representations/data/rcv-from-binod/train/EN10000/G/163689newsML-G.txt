several killings in East Timor have increased tension in the former Portuguese colony , back in the spotlight after Nobel Peace Prize awards last month , residents and diplomatic analysts said on Monday . 
despite Indonesia &apos;s efforts over 20 years to integrate the territory , soldiers , rebels and ordinary people were still dying in a sporadic guerrilla conflict which showed no sign of ending , they said . 
Indonesian military authorities said that the most senior East Timorese serving in its army in the territory had been killed in the past two weeks while four villagers had been shot dead in a separate incident . 
no one has claimed responsibility for the killings , which follow a number of other unconfirmed reports of disappearances and deaths in recent months , residents and international human rights groups said . 
residents said the reports and deaths had increased tension in the territory , which Indonesia invaded in December 1975 and integrated as its 27th province the following July . 
the United Nations has never recognised Indonesia &apos;s annexation and regards Portugal as East Timor &apos;s administering power . 
&quot; The killings have not really improved the situation and an atmosphere of fear and threat remains among the people , &quot; a resident of the East Timor capital , Dili , told Reuters . 
the territory &apos;s problems shot back into the spotlight last month when two East Timorese , Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo and self-exiled separatist Fretilin spokesman Jose Ramos-Horta , were awarded the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize . 
Timor watchers say the confirmed deaths are only a part of what &apos;s happening in the territory covering the eastern half of Timor island , some 2,000 km ( 1,200 miles ) east of Jakarta . 
&quot; compared to those deaths officially acknowledged , the killing of informers and soldiers in combat by Fretilin ( guerrillas ) is far more significant , &quot; one Timor watcher said . 
the Indonesian military rarely reports either the combat deaths of its soldiers or killings of its informers by rebels . 
diplomats familiar with the territory say residents are reluctant to report informers &apos; deaths to outside groups . 
the military estimates there are only around 180 Fretilin guerrillas operating in the rugged hills . 
but diplomats and human rights groups say there is a widespread desire to see a military withdrawal and for more autonomy from Jakarta . 
in the most recent confirmed deaths , Sergeant Major Julio Fraga , head of a feared local militia raised from among Fretilin defectors , was shot eight times late at night in Baucau , 100 km ( 60 miles ) east of Dili . 
the army chief in East Timor , Colonel Mahidin Simbolon , said a probe had been launched into what he called an &quot; inside job &quot; . 
the umbrella East Timor resistance group , the National Council of Maubere Resistance , last week said Fraga &apos;s death was an &quot; assassination &quot; by the Indonesian army for unclear reasons . 
local concern increased after four men in a village 70 km ( 40 miles ) east of Dili were found dead in the forest last Friday after going hunting earlier in the week . 
two of the dead were bound and had a number of knife and axe wounds . 
the local army commander blamed the deaths on Fretilin , but one Timor watcher said it was unusual for Fretilin to bind its victims before killing them .
