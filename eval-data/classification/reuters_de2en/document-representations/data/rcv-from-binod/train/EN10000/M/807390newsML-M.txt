India and Pakistan have benefitted from lower oil product prices this year as they successfully renewed existing term import contracts at reduced values , industry sources said on Monday . 
&quot; The lower prices that India managed to get from Kuwait were made possible because the market has been soft for most of the year , &quot; a MidEast trader said . 
&quot; We did have a time in March and April when regional prices rose but this was mainly because a Singapore trader was buying up all those cargoes but most of the time prices were soft . 
traders said diesel prices this year averaged $ 26 a barrel , on a free-on-board ( fob ) Singapore basis , from $ 30 last year . 
average MidEast prices are about $ 1.00- $ 1.50 below Singapore . 
diesel prices hit a high of $ 28.30 in late March when the Singapore trader and a group of traders started their three-month buying spree totalling about 20 million barrels , but have since fallen to the current $ 22.50 . 
state-owned Indian Oil Corp ( IOC ) is the latest beneficiary of the low prices in the Middle East when it renewed its &quot; evergreen &quot; term contract with Kuwait Petroleum Corp ( KPC ) , traders said . 
it bought the 1.0 percent sulphur diesel at 25 cents per barrel above MidEast spot quotes , on an fob basis , shaving off 45 cents from the previous contract . 
the volume was raised to 2.07 million tonnes from 1.5 million . 
IOC also paid less for its 1.08 million tonnes of 0.25 percent sulphur diesel at a 92-cent-premium to MidEast quotes , fob , from a $ 1.25-premium previously . 
India knocked off 30 cents from its purchase of 1.08 million tonnes of kerosene to 22 cents above MidEast quotes , fob basis . 
traders said the lower premiums will not only influence the prices that IOC would get in its term talks with Abu Dhabi National Oil Co ( ADNOC ) and Bahrain National Oil Co ( BANOCO ) starting next month , but also on premium levels next year . 
India &apos;s diesel demand is growing annually by a hefty 10-percent , and it is also seeking more oil products by term deals in order to guarantee a stable supply base at predetermined prices , instead of being subjected to spot price volatility , traders said . 
IOC once again initiated talks early this month with Saudi Aramco to buy about one million tonnes of diesel on an annual term basis . 
but as had happened over the last four years , the talks collapsed , traders said . 
they said the contentious point remained Aramco &apos;s insistence that prices be pegged to the Singapore spot quotes , while IOC wanted to base it on MidEast spot quotes . 
traders also said IOC had gone to the negotiating table with Aramco armed with the low prices it received from KPC , which proved unacceptable to the Saudis . 
they said that by raising its term volumes , India might buy less 1.0 percent sulphur diesel through monthly spot tenders . 
it might even cease buying spot 0.25 percent sulphur diesel as these would be covered by the three monthly cargoes that it is taking by term contracts . 
in addition to the term contracts with KPC , ADNOC and BANOCO , which amounted to 5.1 million tonnes , India also takes a total of 3.74 million tonnes of 1.0 and 0.25 percent sulphur diesel by annual term tenders . 
India &apos;s oil import budget for the financial year ended March 1997 was $ 7.0 billion , but it overshot the limit by $ 2.0 billion . 
its oil import budget for the current fiscal year is $ 9.8 billion . 
Pakistan also paid nearly 40-percent less for its term diesel , and 20-percent less for fuel oil in the second half of the year when it revised the term prices with KPC , said an official with the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources . 
&quot; There is a general glut of the product in the market and prices were negotiated lower , &quot; Director General of Oil , G.A. 
Fabri told Reuters . 
Pakistan takes 75-percent of its total import requirements of 1.0 percent sulphur diesel and 3.5 percent sulphur fuel oil through two-year term contracts which expires in December 1998 . 
the remaining 25-percent are furnished through quarterly spot tenders , Fabri said . 
in the latest six-monthly price review with KPC , which supplies all the term diesel imports , the premiums for cargoes that are below 46,000 tonnes were cut to 78 cents per barrel to MidEast spot quotes , on a cost-and-freight ( c-and-f ) basis . 
cargoes that are more than 46,000 tonnes are priced at an 87-cent premium . 
for the first six months , the premium was at $ 1.25 per barrel , c-and-f basis . 
the fuel oil premium was cut by $ 1.50 per tonne to $ 7.75 over MidEast spot quotes , c-and-f , Fabri said . 
Saudi-based Bakri Trading supplies 50-percent of Pakistan &apos;s term fuel oil imports , and KPC the remaining 25-percent . 
Fabri said Pakistan currently has a net deficit of oil products of around 11 million tonnes a year , or 5.5 million tonnes each of diesel and fuel oil .
