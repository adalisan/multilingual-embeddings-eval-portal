former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar flew to London to receive a 40,000 pound ( $ 66,400 ) pay-off from a Far Eastern betting syndicate for rigging a match in late November 1993 , a court heard on Monday . 
Chris Vincent , chief prosecution witness in a match-fixing trial against Grobbelaar and three others , said the goalkeeper chose to throw the game against Newcastle after talking to a betting syndicate middleman the keeper called the &quot; Short Man . 
&quot; In the weekend leading up to the Newcastle game , after one of the calls to the Short Man , Grobbelaar said to me : &apos; I &apos;m doing the business this weekend &apos; , &quot; said Vincent , who like Grobbelaar comes from Zimbabwe . 
Grobbelaar is accused of fixing matches with the help of former striker John Fashanu and Malaysian businessmen Heng Suan Lim , who both received large cash sums from the Far East . 
neither could explain where the money had come from . 
the prosecution says the &quot; Short Man &quot; is Lim and telephone records show the two men talked constantly , especially in the run-up to soccer matches . 
Vincent , who exchanged several long glances with Grobbelaar across the court room before giving evidence , saw the footballer in his car after the game , which Newcastle won 3-0 , and said &quot; Good result &quot; . 
Grobbelaar , who had a passenger with him , replied &quot; Ja &quot; ( yes ) but said nothing else . 
&quot; To me personally he said he was going to collect the money , &quot; said Vincent , who flew down to London the following Thursday with the keeper to pick up the money . 
Vincent was a former business associate of Grobbelaar who helped break the story in November 1994 when he covertly recorded the keeper admitting he had tried to throw games . 
he then handed over the tapes to the Sun tabloid newspaper . 
Vincent , in prison on another matter , said Grobbelaar decided to fix games because he was unhappy at being paid less than newcomers to the Liverpool team such as midfielder Paul Stewart and striker Dean Saunders . 
&quot; He said he knew he only had a couple of years left in top flight soccer and would make as much money from soccer as he could , &quot; Vincent told the court in the southern English city of Winchester . 
in the middle of 1993 Grobbelaar said Fashanu had introduced him to men from the Far East who were prepared to pay 1,500 to 2,000 pounds a week for predicting the outcome of soccer games , Vincent said , adding that the keeper had then decided to go further . 
&quot; You know the people I talked to from the Far East ? 
I will meet one of them and we &apos;re going to discuss getting paid for fixing soccer games , &quot; Vincent quoted Grobbelaar as saying . 
Vincent then asked how this could be done . 
&quot; He said he &apos;d been the Liverpool keeper for 14 years and if he was standing a foot off his line nobody would know . 
Grobbelaar , with Vincent in tow , met the Short Man in September 1993 at Manchester airport to pick up 1,000 pounds . 
&quot; He told me the guy he &apos;d just met was prepared to pay big bucks to throw soccer games , in the region of 40,000 to 60,000 pounds , &quot; Vincent said . 
Grobbelaar met the Short Man again about a week later in early October at London &apos;s Heathrow airport , where he picked up another 750 pounds . 
Vincent said there was no doubt the Short Man was Lim . 
Grobbelaar first met Vincent in July 1992 and soon started investing money in a company Vincent had set up to promote safari tours to Zimbabwe . 
in all , the keeper invested 65,000 pounds before the two men fell out in 1994 . 
&quot; We became incredibly good friends , &quot; Vincent told the court . 
the other man on trial is former Wimbledon goalkeeper Hans Segers , accused with Lim and Fashanu of taking part in a separate bid to fix matches . 
all four pleaded not guilty .
