Italian debt markets got back on Italy &apos;s political rollercoaster for a while on Tuesday before deciding the government was unlikely to fall this week and cutting the day &apos;s losses in half . 
Btps futures , unnerved by the hard-left &apos;s decision not to back the government in its motion on leading a multinational force in Albania , trickled 60 basis points down to start off . 
the drop extended to 100 basis points after the centre-right opposition said it would not back the government either . 
but the market then began to expect a compromise between government and opposition and recouped half the lost ground by the close . 
the June BTP future on LIFFE was 48 basis points lower at 127.02 while the February 2007 BTP ended 48 basis points down at 92.27 . 
the lira remained remarkably steady between 986 and 989 per mark for the entire roller coaster ride . 
&quot; It would be stupid to have a crisis over this . 
if we can &apos;t find agreement on foreign policy how can we solve our own domestic problems ? 
&quot; said one Italian broker in London . 
&quot; It &apos;s been a very confused situation , &quot; said Luca Jellinek at Paribas in London . 
&quot; But it would seem incredible if the government fell on this . 
it &apos;s yet another example of the fragility of the market . 
the upper house or Senate , where the ruling Olive Tree coalition has a majority , is due to vote this evening on the mission to Albania . 
the vote in the Lower House , where Prime Minister Romano Prodi needs the support of Communist Refoundation for a majority , is due on Wednesday . 
&quot; The market is going to consolidate before tomorrow &apos;s vote , &quot; a broker at an Italian bank in London .
