the Indonesian rupiah recovered against the dollar in late trading on Wednesday despite jitters on the eve of general elections , dealers said . 
one U.S. bank dealer said it was mainly tight liquidity which helped the rupiah to regain some ground . 
overnight rupiah rose to nine percent from 4.5 percent in the morning . 
spot / next swaps were at 1.5 points before settling at 0.5 . 
the dealer said the tightness helped the rebound , but underlying sentiment remained cautious . 
&quot; There is not much drive in the market in the afternoon . 
people tended to stay square or slightly long on dollars , &quot; he added . 
spot rupiah was at 2,442.5 / 43.5 at 0900 GMT , compared with a day low of 2,445.50 . 
it opened at 2,442.0 / 44.0 . 
today rupiah closed at 2,444.5 / 45.0 . 
dealers said the market was nervous because of rumours of possible trouble during the voting on Thursday . 
a bomb threat at the Japanese embassy on Wednesday morning also unsettled the market . 
but many economists believed the rupiah to be able to recover to the strong end of the central bank band after the election . 
one European bank dealer in Singapore said the market expected the ruling Golkar party to win but the margin of victory will be of interest because anything less than a 70 percent majority would be negative for the rupiah . 
Golkar , in power for 30 years , has set a target of 70.02 percent of the vote compared with the 68 percent it won in the 1992 elections . 
the dealer said Jakarta parties were seen buying the rupiah actively in early trade as short-dated swaps softened . 
overnight swaps ended at -0.4 / -0.1 points . 
dealers said longer-term swaps were higher following a turnaround in the short-term market . 
one Japanese bank dealer said operators had placed too much of their excess liquidity in central bank papers ( SBIs ) in the morning , causing some tightening in the afternoon . 
one-month swaps edged up to 13.0 / 14.5 from 12.85 / 13.75 , two to 28.0 / 30.0 from 26.5 / 28.0 , three to 38.0 / 40.0 from 36.5 / 38.5 and six to 77.0 / 79.0 from 76.5 / 77.5 points . 
the central bank kept its intervention band at 2,414 / 2,606 but raised its conversion band by five points to 2,420 / 2,468 on Wednesday .
