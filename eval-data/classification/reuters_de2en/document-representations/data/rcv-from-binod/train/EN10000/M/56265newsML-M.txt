Bullion prices floundered on Monday , seeking direction after the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) delayed a decision on selling its gold reserves and stock markets soared to fresh highs . 
&quot; At the moment , I think I &apos;ll just sit it out , &quot; said one bullion dealer , adding that the near-term direction hinged on what the big investment funds would do next . 
gold fixed a touch softer at $ 382.65 an ounce after $ 382.80 on Friday afternoon and a London close on Friday of $ 383.05 . 
activity was thin through the European morning after a sluggish overnight session with Tokyo closed for a holiday . 
the IMF last week put off a decision on a controversial proposal to sell five million ounces of its 104 million ounce gold reserve to help poor nations . 
it said after a meeting on Friday it would hold another board meeting on Wednesday . 
the market had been expecting a bounce on news of an IMF decision , since the price was seen as having exhausted its short-term potential to go lower and with funds having already taken heavy positions . 
but one dealer said it was unclear where the market would next move . 
&quot; The funds might want to push it lower before they cover ( their positions ) , but then again these ( prices ) might be the lows . 
the IMF &apos;s delay was seen as indicating problems reaching a consensus and that any sale might have to be cut back . 
the market was generally gloomy about the longer-term implications of any sale , some analysts said . 
&quot; The concern is that the policy decision potentially opens the floodgates for the sale of gold from other holdings , notably central banks , &quot; said Nick Moore of Flemings Global Mining Group . 
gold was seen restrained by buoyant stock markets as investors turn their attention elsewhere . 
Britain &apos;s FTSE 100-share index soared to a fresh record high of around 3,980 points on Monday after the Dow Jones Industrial average set a new record on Friday on friendly inflation data . 
German shares also hit new highs on Monday . 
silver was seen as a weak link in the precious complex , with a breach of $ 5.00 likely to trigger further losses in the other metals , dealers and analysts said . 
by midday , silver was quoted at $ 5.04 per ounce , three cents below Friday &apos;s London close . 
platinum was also weaker at $ 388.00 per ounce , off $ 1.20 , and palladium was barely changed at $ 122.75 , down 25 cents .
