following is a selection of economists &apos; reactions to the decision of Britain &apos;s monetary policy committee to raise base rates by a quarter-point to 6.75 percent . 
&quot; The danger here is that the market will think it &apos;s not enough . 
the short sterling market is baying for blood . 
there will be some disappointment that they haven &apos;t gone for 50 ( basis points ) . 
it opens the possiblity of more rises in the future . 
&quot; I think the Bank of England should have been rather more aggressive . 
the state of the economy calls for tougher action on interest rates . 
&quot; pretty much as we expected . 
because it was only 0.25 percent there might be some profit-taking . 
wait for the next one . 
&quot; Some people ( in the market ) were expecting a half-point ( rise ) . 
the market is out-performing at the short end . 
&quot; It &apos;s a missed opportunity . 
the Bank of England have been a little timid . 
as long as the forex market has something to look forward to , it &apos;s unlikey to offload its positions . 
by the year end we &apos;ll be looking at a rate of 7.25 percent . 
&quot; The danger is that they may be rebalancing the economy but at lower levels of growth and output . 
we may have to be dusting off the &apos; R &apos; word , the recession word , as manufacturing slows down next year . 
&quot; The manufacturing side is concerned . 
it will have a knock-on effect on jobs , profit and investment . 
&quot; completely as expected . 
the Bank of England noted the well-above trend growth and sterling has sharpened the policy dilemma . 
going on from here , there is more to come . 
it is difficult to know when the next one is going to come . 
they may hold on if they can and leave the next one until September . 
&quot; The 25-basis point hike by the Bank of England today was largely expected . 
but is unlikely to be deemed enough in the money markets to slow consumer spending to the pace needed to remove any inflation threat . 
to this end , many will look for another 25 basis points move at either the August and / or the September MPC meetings . 
&quot; We would certainly expect a 7 percent base rate by the end of this quarter .
