Indian Industry Minister Murasoli Maran said on Wednesday he expected the economy to grow around 6.6 percent in the 1996 / 97 ( April-March ) year . 
&quot; Overall , gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth is expected to be around 6.6 percent in 1996 / 97 . 
the industrial growth is expected to be maintained at double-digit levels , &quot; Maran told an economic editors conference . 
some economic analysts have expressed concern over a possible slowdown in industrial growth this year after growth of 12 percent in 1995 / 96 ( April-March ) . 
the industrial production index in April-July slowed to 9.3 percent , compared with 12.3 percent in the same 1995 / 96 period . 
on foreign investment generally , he said it was necessary but it was not sufficient to spur domestic industry growth . 
&quot; If we miss the bus , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) would go to China or other neighbouring countries , &quot; he said . 
he said the future of economic reforms hinged on the performance of domestic industry , not foreign investment alone . 
&quot; We can &apos;t simply open the doors for multinational corporations ( MNCs ) because MNCs and foreign direct investment ( FDI ) alone cannot create an economic miracle in India , &quot; Maran said . 
he said the industry ministry approved 648 proposals for foreign investment worth $ 6.32 billion in the period July-October . 
the ministry is planning to set up a unit to oversee speedy implementation of foreign investment plans , of over one billion rupees ( $ 28 million ) , Maran said . 
it would also appoint an ombudsman to look into complaints about delays in implementation of foreign investment plans .
