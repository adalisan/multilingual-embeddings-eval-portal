following is a survey of economists &apos; expectations for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand &apos;s economic projections due on Thursday , March 13 . 
we asked economists whether they expected the Reserve Bank on Thursday to signal : 
( a ) explicitly or 
( B ) implicitly an easing in monetary conditions ; 
or signal 
( C ) explicitly or 
( d ) implicitly a tightening in conditions ; 
or ( e ) to urge financial markets to hold conditions steady . 
following are their responses and comments : 
&quot; Further slight easing in coming months contingent upon further evidence of easing inflationary pressures . 
&quot; Conditions currently tighter than likely &apos; preferred conditions &apos; . 
&quot; There is room for a slight easing in conditions in the June quarter , however the risks to this are many , so the probability of it eventuating remains low . 
&quot; We think the RBNZ &apos;s assumed mix will be somewhat easier than where the market is today . 
however , it will be the same overall mix as assumed in the December ( monetary policy ) statement . 
&quot; expect RB to remain uncomfortable with inflationary expectations in private sector and underlying ( inflation ) close to top end of 0-3 PCT band . 
&quot; If they fall back to 2 : 1 line ( where the RBNZ said a 2 percent move in the currency index approximately offset a one percentage point move in 90-day bank bills ) beforehand , then ( e ) applies . 
current conditions are now 100 basis points tighther than the RB &apos;s December optimal . 
this is probably unnecessary . 
&quot; The market has done much of the tightening for them . 
&quot; But the inflation forecasts will suggest a bias to ( b ) . 
possibly the next explicit action will be to tighten by end-1997 . 
&quot; tightening September 1997 . 
we asked economists to state what they thought the RBNZ would forecast for growth in production-based GDP ( March quarter to March quarter ) in the following years . 
we asked economists to state what they thought the RBNZ &apos;s forecasts will be for March quarter to March quarter changes in underlying inflation ; the rate of appreciation the bank will assume in the New Zealand dollar Trade-Weighted Index , and the starting point it will take for the index ; and the bank &apos;s technical assumption for 90-day bank bill rates over its forecast period . 
96-97 97-98 Rate ( % ) From 
* BTNZ said there was a chance oil prices were removed for the March 1997 quarter . 
* * WestpacTrust said that in addition to these 90-day bank bill and TWI assumptions , the Reserve Bank would assume the same 2 : 1 trade-off between the two that it detailed in the December monetary policy statement .
