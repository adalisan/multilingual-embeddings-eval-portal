the Dow industrials recovered from early lows in late morning trade on Monday and technology stocks gathered steam , prompting the New York Stock Exchange to lift curbs on index-arbitrage trading . 
the Dow Jones Industrial average , which hit a session low of 8134 amid a weaker bond market and concerns about inflation and interest rates , pared losses . 
it was down 14 points at 8180 . 
the long bond also eased itself off early lows , trading down 12 / 32 to yield 6.48 percent . 
&quot; Stocks were down across the board , then rallied back , &quot; said Doug Meyers , vice president of equity trading at Interstate / Johnson Lane . 
&quot; This is a week without too much economic data , so that relieves some of the recent skittishness . 
the Nasdaq composite , which stood firm most of the session despite the Dow &apos;s declines , was up seven points at 1601 .
