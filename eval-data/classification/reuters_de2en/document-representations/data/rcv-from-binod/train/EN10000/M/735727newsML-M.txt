* Selling still expected into rallies but market seen short after recent selling and so some shortcovering support expected , with focus remaining on next week &apos;s inflation and wage data . 
the Australian dollar is holding above key resistance at US $ 0.7310 , the 18-month low set earlier this week , with a short market offering the dollar some support , traders said . 
however , there was still good selling interest into rallies , and with the market edgy ahead of the possible rate implications from next week &apos;s second quarter wage and inflation data , gains were expected to prove hard to sustain . 
a break of this level would be seen offering some respite to the downside pressures for the dollar , traders said . 
against the yen , the Australian dollar was slightly softer at 85.14 / 24 from Thursday &apos;s close of 85.56 / 66 . 
one factor that is expected to weigh on the Australian dollar is the weakness of the New Zealand dollar . 
by early Friday , the kiwi had fallen over a full cent from late Thursday to a 19-month low of US $ 0.6465 / 72 . 
also helping to keep a lid on the dollar are expectations that second quarter inflation and wage data next Wednesday and Thursday respectively would open the way for a Reserve Bank of Australia rate cut , possibly as soon as next Friday . 
with no local data out before Wednesday &apos;s inflation figures , the market had little else to distract it from thoughts of a rate cut , which traders said was expected to keep pressure on the dollar and attract sellers to rallies .
