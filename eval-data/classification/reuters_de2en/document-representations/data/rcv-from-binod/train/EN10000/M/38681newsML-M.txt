------------------------- Sept 6 ---------------------------- 
* Market seen remaining listless 
Manila shares closed weaker on Friday as the market continued to be hounded by uncertainty over the direction of U.S. interest rates and the tension between the U.S. and Iraq , traders said . 
the composite index dropped by 21.40 points , or 0.67 percent , to 3,170.16 points following Thursday &apos;s 6.04-point drop . 
losers swamped gainers 87 to 22 . 
while most blue chips succumbed to profit-taking , key index stock Philippine Long Distance telephone Co ( PLDT ) bucked the trend , rising 10 pesos to 1,595 . 
&quot; PLDT seems to be the only light in the darkness as investors are positioning themselves ahead of the change in PLDT &apos;s billing system to metering next year , &quot; said Juanis Barredo at Citisecurities . 
trading would continue to remain subdued next week as the market was still cautious about overseas developments , he said .
