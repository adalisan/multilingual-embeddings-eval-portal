former security chief Alexander Lebed will wake up on Friday knowing he faces a long hard fight if he is to make a comeback from his abrupt sacking by President Boris Yeltsin and become Russia &apos;s next leader . 
Yeltsin , preparing for bypass heart surgery next month , announced on national television that he was dismissing Lebed from his top Kremlin post for lack of team spirit and his naked ambition to become the next president . 
Lebed , a blunt-speaking former paratroop general , paid the price for antagonising his Kremlin colleagues during a power struggle which sharpened after Yeltsin said on September 5 that he was preparing to undergo heart surgery . 
in typical gruff fashion , the laconic Lebed , 46 , shrugged off his dismissal , saying he had been dumped because he refused to run with the pack . 
it was only a matter of time before they sacked me . 
I am not part of their herd , &quot; he told a news conference , appealing to his supporters for calm . 
the State Duma ( lower house of parliament ) was due on Friday to discuss the situation following Lebed &apos;s sacking . 
but he can count on little support since many deputies oppose the peace deal he brokered in breakaway Chechnya last August . 
Lebed said he was sorry to have lost the job as Yeltsin &apos;s envoy in Chechnya and showed little hope that the peace process would now stay on track . 
Lebed won the support of 11 million people during the first round of presidential elections in June and a recent opinion poll found him to be the country &apos;s most trusted politician . 
his strong third-place showing in the first round made him a kingmaker and Yeltsin quickly promoted him to the powerful post of Security Council chief . 
Yeltsin subsequently secured the support of Lebed &apos;s voters in the second round to beat communist candidate Gennady Zyuganov and win a second term in office . 
but since moving into the Kremlin , Lebed has faced strong resistance to further advancement from powerful rivals such as Yeltsin &apos;s chief of staff Anatoly Chubais . 
&quot; I was an obstacle to plans by Chubais to set up a regency . 
he wants to become president , &quot; said Lebed . 
underlining his isolation , several key political figures rushed to back Yeltsin . 
&quot; What happened was to be expected . 
the country &apos;s top officials have long been aware that something was going wrong , &quot; said Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin . 
&quot; The only thing which surprises me is how much patience he ( Yeltsin ) showed up to now , &quot; he told reporters . 
powerful Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov -- an avowed Lebed enemy and seen in some circles as a potential contender at the next presidential poll -- was among several top officials to voice support for Yeltsin &apos;s move . 
but what must have especially pained Lebed was the criticism from Defence Minister Igor Rodionov , who he considered to be one of his own team . 
&quot; There is the matter of ( Lebed &apos;s ) manner of taking decisions and his unwillingness to confer ... and discuss problems in good time before taking a decision , &quot; said Rodionov , adding that Yeltsin &apos;s criticisms of Lebed had been accurate . 
during the presidential elections there were widespread rumours that Yeltsin &apos;s team , worried about the threat posed by Communist Zyuganov , had offered Lebed substantial backing to split the opposition vote . 
Lebed is now out in the cold . 
but he can draw comfort from the example of Yeltsin himself who was in a similar predicament in 1987 when former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev engineered his removal from the policy-making Soviet Politburo . 
Yeltsin seemed then to heading for political oblivion . 
but four years later he was in effective charge of the country .
