U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun flew into the Congo Republic &apos;s battered capital Brazzaville on Tuesday for peace talks , a source close to President Pascal Lissouba said . 
witnesses said a fragile ceasefire , which took effect at midnight , held despite a brief dawn burst of shellfire . 
Sahnoun began his visit with talks with Lissouba , who has been locked in a bloody showdown with his predecessor Denis Sassou Nguesso for over a month . 
former military ruler Sassou and Lissouba both put their names to the truce , proposed by Gabon &apos;s veteran president , Omar Bongo , to end political and ethnic clashes that have killed hundreds of people . 
sources close to mediation efforts said Bongo invited the two sides plus Brazzaville mayor and national mediator Bernard Kolelas to peace talks in his capital Libreville on Tuesday . 
earlier truces have held a day or so but have disintegrated into fresh mortar and rocket exchanges which have put tens of thousands of civilians to flight and devastated the capital of the oil-producing former French colony . 
Sahnoun , who helped negotiate the truce , said on Sunday the talks would focus on national reconciliation and creating an environment for a presidential election in the next two months . 
plans are taking shape for a U.N.-sponsored , mainly African peacekeeping force . 
the bloody showdown began on June 5 when soldiers surrounded Sassou &apos;s home as part of a crackdown on private militias ahead of a now-postponed July 27 presidential election . 
Lissouba , Sassou and Kolelas , whose militia have kept out of the latest fighting , planned to contest the July 27 election . 
Lissouba &apos;s mandate expires at the end of August . 
he says the constitution allows a 90-day extension to organise elections . 
Sassou demands a national salvation government . 
Kolelas &apos;s militia was at the heart of similar political and ethnic clashes that killed at least 2,000 people in Brazzaville after a disputed 1993 parliamentary election .
