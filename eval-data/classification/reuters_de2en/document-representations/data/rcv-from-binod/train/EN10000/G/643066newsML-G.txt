Beijing Zoo officials on Friday showed off a bouncing baby Panda that represents a chance for the survival of the endangered species and said they hoped adults chewing bamboo in adjacent cages would mate and multiply . 
&quot; This is the only Panda born in a Chinese zoo last year to survive , &quot; Beijing zoo Panda consultant Hou Qiming said as he picked up a wriggling , eight-month-old Jingxin in her cage . 
Jingxin was born on October 4 last year , and is one of only three Panda cubs to survive among a total of eight born in captivity in China last year . 
her birth was kept secret for several months until her keepers were sure that the cub would survive and she lives under the 24-hour watch of dedicated keepers in the Panda compound of the Beijing Zoo . 
visitors craned for a glimpse of Jingxin , who is not yet formally on display and lives in a cage separated from the rest of the compound that is open to the public . 
Jingxin is a product of an enormous amount of careful monitoring by Panda experts , round-the-clock care and attention from her keepers and a brief one-hour mating between her famously frigid parents . 
only some 1,000 pandas survive in China and experts fear their numbers are slowly declining as those in the wild succumb to Man &apos;s invasion into their remote mountain lairs , and to their notoriously poor ability to mate and reproduce . 
Hou estimated that pandas living in the wild had a mere 20 percent chance of producing a healthy cub while those that bred in captivity had a 90 percent chance of survival . 
Jingxin was one of a pair of cubs born to the Beijing Zoo &apos;s Le Le , or Happiness , last October . 
her sibling did not survive . 
Le Le , 11 , became pregnant last year after twice being artificially inseminated and also after two one-hour mating sessions with males Liang Liang and Ying Ying . 
those pairings have left zoo keepers with the problem of trying to trace the father to prevent future inbreeding . 
however , Hou said he was fairly confident that Liang Liang , 11 , was the father of the zoo &apos;s precious cub , a potential mother and progenitor of her rare species when she matures in four years . 
&quot; This type of birth proves that male pandas born in captivity can in fact breed , &quot; Hou said . 
&quot; People were afraid that only pandas born in the wild would have the ability to mate but here at the Beijing Zoo you can see that Liang Liang knows how to do this . 
Jingxin showed off for visitors by sprawling across an old tyre hanging in her cage , sliding over a metal rocking chair and gambolling around her keeper in search of arrow bamboo stalks . 
&quot; She &apos;s in a very good condition . 
she was separated from her mother at five months ... because we thought that we should let the mother rest , &quot; Hou said . 
Hou and the Beijing Zoo &apos;s experts are hoping for another birth after Yong Yong mated with Liang Liang earlier this year . 
&quot; Yong Yong is really our only hope for a cub this year , &quot; said Hou . 
but it may be weeks yet before keepers know if she is pregnant . 
&quot; We only know days or a few weeks before a birth if a Panda is pregnant and the length of a pregnancy is very difficult to estimate , &quot; said chief Panda keeper Wang Wanmin . 
Le Le , mother of the zoo &apos;s youngest Panda , is unlikely to get a chance to mate this year , keepers said . 
she is resting , feasting on carrots and arrow bamboo to regain her strength after she stopped suckling Jingxin two months ago .
