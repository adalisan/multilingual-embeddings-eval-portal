a United Nations spokesman said on Monday it was &quot; worrying &quot; that Bosnian police had failed to find explosives planted on the motorcade route of Pope John Paul until they received a tip from a worker . 
&quot; It is extremely worrying that this bomb was discovered as a result of a tip by a local worker and not found earlier during a routine inspection by the local police , &quot; Alex Ivanko , spokesman for the U.N. mission , told a news conference . 
only hours before the Pope arrived for a historic visit to Sarajevo on Saturday , Moslem-Croat federation police removed 23 anti-tank mines connected to a remote control system under a bridge along the Papal motorcade route . 
the explosives were removed and the Pontiff went ahead with his two-day visit to the Bosnian capital . 
authorities have announced no arrests or suspects linked to the apparent assassination threat . 
police discovered a total of 150 kg ( 330 pounds ) of explosives which were planted less than 24 hours before the Pope &apos;s arrival , Ivanko , citing reports from U.N. police monitors at the scene , said . 
&quot; There was a very serious device under the bridge which could have blown away the bridge , &quot; he said . 
Ivanko said federation police dismantled the explosives within 20 minutes . 
police also found a walkie-talkie at the site which could have been used to detonate the explosives from a distance , he said . 
Moslem-Croat federation officials confirmed the discovery of the explosives over the weekend but have so far declined to comment on the case . 
the NATO-led Stabilisation Force ( SFOR ) said it was satisfied with security measures undertaken by police for the Papal trip . 
SFOR spokesman Major Tony White said explosives found on the route were &quot; dealt with effectively &quot; by federation police . 
&quot; It is hoped that the ongoing investigation is as effective in determining who was responsible , &quot; White told reporters .
