boxed beef traded lower for the week , with strong demand , but at the lower price levels , and offerings were heavy , USDA said . 
these conditions of heavy offerings were brought on by heavy retail resistance of the sharply higher material costs of the prior week . 
chuck and round cuts were under heavy downward pressure early in the week and never regained any of the earlier losses . 
rib and loin cuts were generally steady during the earlier part of the week , but as the week progressed , these cuts also were under heavy downward pressure and traded lower . 
most of the heavy buying was for retail featuring in the coming weeks . 
closely trimmed items also traded lower on good demand for the same period of featuring needs . 
beef trimmings were lower on rather light demand and light to moderate offerings . 
fed cattle and blended coarse ground items traded higher on light to moderate demand and light offerings . 
for the week - Select and Choice rib primal 2.00 to 5.00 lower ; Select and Choice chuck primal 2.50 to 5.50 lower ; Select and Choice round primal 5.00 lower ; Select and Choice loin primal 3.00 to 6.00 lower ; Closely trimmed items 3.00 to 4.00 lower ; Beef trimmings 7.00 lower ; Fed cattle and blended coarse ground items 2.00 to 4.00 higher . 
the estimated composite of boxed Beef Cutout values of Choice 1-3 550 / 700 carcasses Dn 3.41 at 103.11 ; 700 / 850 Dn 4.18 at 101.79 ; Select 1-3 550 / 700 carcasses Dn 4.87 at 97.47 ; 700 / 850 Dn 4.58 at 96.74 . 
this decline was mainly due to lackluster demand and moderate offering , caused by the increased marketing of slaughter cows compared to recent weeks . 
on the other hand buyers needs were limited as demand continues to be light for finished product . 
in addition , the cow carcasses market felt the pressure from the boneless beef market and moved at lower prices on light demand and light to moderate offerings . 
cow cuts market traded uneven , with the prices of 100 % lean items increasing with good demand and many of the other cutter cuts trading steady on light to moderate demand and offerings .
