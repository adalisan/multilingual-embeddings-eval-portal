a Chechen bomb attack that left two Russians dead and more than 20 wounded was an act of terrorism , but will not affect a ceasefire concluded last August , Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Tuesday . 
speaking at a news conference in the Slovak capital during an official visit , Chernomydin condemned the attack at a railway station in Pyatigorsk , 130 km ( 80 miles ) northwest of the Chechen border , but added Russia &apos;s attitude toward the peace accord was unchanged by the act . 
&quot; Terror is vandalism and innocent people die ... and this is vandalism , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But our relations toward the ( peace ) treaty will not be affected by this ... the Chechen leadership has denied any connection with these terrorist attacks . 
he added that Chechen leaders had assured authorities that they were not involved in Monday &apos;s blast . 
the ceasefire halted fighting between the two sides . 
but it did not result in a long-term peace treaty , which is currently under negotiation and intended to open the way for Moscow &apos;s help in restoring Chechnya , where the capital Grozny and other towns were largely destroyed by heavy attacks by the Russian military .
