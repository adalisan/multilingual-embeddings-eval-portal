Madrid stocks closed slightly lower on Wednesday after a volatile day &apos;s trade , with Telefonica gains partly offsetting broader losses , dealers said . 
the general index fell 1.51 points , 0.32 percent , to 466.21 and the ibex shed 17.60 points , 0.33 percent , to 5,319.08 . 
volatility is keeping final investors away , with short-termism at the fore . 
overall dealers were expecting caution to continue , with money mainly stemming from speculative trades , and bluechips trading erratically . 
Telefonica gained 45 pesetas to 3,335 amid heavy volume . 
continued strong sentiment towards the stock after the privatisation is backing the shares , dealers said . 
Cantabrico ended off 35 pesetas at 4,855 after it said it would sign the framework for competition in the electricity sector , which it refused to do in December . 
&quot; It was inconceivable that they wouldn &apos;t sign eventually , &quot; said one . 
although theoretically this should be a psychological factor underpinning the shares , the market is mainly ignoring the electricity sector until the final details of the protocol are agreed later this month , he added .
