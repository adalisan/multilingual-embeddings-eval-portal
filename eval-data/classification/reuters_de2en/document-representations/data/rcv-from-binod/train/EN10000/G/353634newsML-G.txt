a South African court on Tuesday postponed the extradition hearing of Australian paedophile suspect Phillip Bell for two weeks to allow his defence lawyer to study the extradition documents . 
bell , 62 , was arrested in the surfing town of Jeffrey &apos;s Bay last month after a worldwide police hunt . 
Australia sent a police officer from its child protection task force to South Africa to make a formal plea for extradition of the wealthy businessman who was apparently trying to settle down in the popular coastal resort . 
bell &apos;s lawyer , Jim Boyens , told the court on Tuesday that he had only received the 200-page extradition documents at the weekend and needed time to study the papers . 
the magistrate granted the postponement to February 18 and ordered that Bell remain in custody in the Eastern Cape province port city of Port Elizabeth . 
the court rejected his bail application on January 20 after hearing he had been charged at home with 215 sex offences relating to boys aged 10 to 18 . 
bell said he wanted bail in order to return to Australia and clear his name . 
the court heard Bell was rich enough and well enough connected round the world to stand a good chance of fleeing if granted bail .
