Argentine bonds finished mixed Thursday as Brady bonds slipped with U.S. treasuries and local bonds retained early gains . 
the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 rose $ 0.35 to 120.65 , while Argentina &apos;s FRB due 2005 slipped 1 / 8 to 84-6 / 8 . 
Lourenco said the market continues &quot; to enjoy good international market conditions , &quot; most notably in the form of the low yield on long U.S. Treasury bonds . 
but there was slim activity again this session , a situation one trader said could continue until the end of the year because many investors have already clocked up large gains in 1996 giving them little inspiration to re-enter the market before 1997 . 
in the money markets , call money rates were stable at 6.15 percent .
