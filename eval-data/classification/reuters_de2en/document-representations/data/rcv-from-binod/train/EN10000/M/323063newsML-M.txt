Singapore shares ended sharply lower on Tuesday as local dealers took heavy profits from Monday &apos;s price rises . 
&quot; It &apos;s been a roller-coaster , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; Up 27 points yesterday , down almost as much today . 
the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index ( STII ) ended 21.09 points lower at 2,250.79 with 306.1 million shares traded . 
losers led gainers by 279 to 140 . 
the fall disappointed some dealers , who had been predicting a strong uptrend after Monday &apos;s close , which was the STII &apos;s highest point since July 4 , 1995 . 
dealers said there had been overseas money coming into the market all day shown by the very high volume , but they said this buying was balanced by widespread local selling . 
the biggest losers of the day were all blue chips : two banks , UOB foreign and OCBC foreign , car retailer Cycle &amp; Carriage and maritime-based conglomerate Keppel Corp. 
most shed the bulk of Monday &apos;s gains . 
the most active stocks were multimedia company Aztech Systems and computer maker IPC Corp Ltd , which dealers said benefited from a positive revaluation of the electronics sector .
