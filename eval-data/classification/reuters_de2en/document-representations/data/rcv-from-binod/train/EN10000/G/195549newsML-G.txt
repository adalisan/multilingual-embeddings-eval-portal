Algeria &apos;s legal Islamist parties refrained from calling on supporters to defy the authorities and vote &quot; No &quot; in a November 28 referendum on a draft constitution banning political groups based on religion . 
both Hamas and Nahda parties gave their supporters the freedom to vote for or against the draft but expressed opposition to the proposed changes . 
&quot; It is a new occasion offered to you to give your opinions beyond any tutelage in the right way you deem adequate while you take responsibility before God , &quot; Hamas &apos;s leader Mahfoud Nahnah said in a statement made public on Sunday . 
the statement gave no orders for Hamas supporters whether they should vote against or endorse the draft constitution but made clear the Islamist movement opposed the move . 
&quot; The un-constitutional measure ( to alter the constitution ) does not contribute to finding a solution to the crisis , &quot; said Nahnah who gained more than a quarter of votes in last year &apos;s presidential poll which returned President Liamine Zeroual to power with more than 60 percent of the vote . 
under the proposed changes , parties based on religion will be banned , although Hamas and Nahda -- the only two legal parties whose founding principles are religious fundamentalism -- will have a year to change their basis . 
Nahda , led Abdallah Djaballah , said in a statement the &quot; movement sees no benefit in taking responsibility to endorse the constitution change &quot; . 
&quot; The people have complete freedom to choose the stand they see able to concretise their political power , &quot; it said . 
Nahda said it prefers the constitution change to be undertaken after the general elections planned for the first half of next year . 
the carefully worded statements by the two legal parties underlined their aim to avoid confrontation with the authorities who have been battling radical Islamists for nearly five years . 
around 60,000 people have been killed in Algeria &apos;s violence since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a huge lead . 
main secular parties have loudly voiced their opposition to the proposed constitution change urging their supporters to stay away or cast &quot; No &quot; ballots . 
the Socialist Forces Front has accused Zeroual of trying , through the proposed constitutional changes , to establish what they called an institutional dictatorship in Algeria . 
government ministers and several other political forces , including the former ruling National Liberation Front , have stepped up a campaign across Algeria saying the proposed constitution will bring stability and security .
