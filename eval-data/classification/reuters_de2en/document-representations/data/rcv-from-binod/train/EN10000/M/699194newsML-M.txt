implied volatilities for U.S. Treasury bond futures-options were constant to softer Tuesday versus Monday as the market bided its time before Thursday &apos;s U.S. jobs data and the long holiday weekend . 
&quot; Vols are holding steady and possibly starting to dribble off , &quot; said one T-bond futures-options floor broker at the Chicago Board of Trade . 
&quot; It &apos;s really not going anywhere . 
futures saw a spurt of activity during the morning when an unexpectedly weak June national purchasing managers &apos; index reinforced perceptions that the Federal Reserve has no economic reason to raise interest rates this week . 
&quot; They &apos;re not going to put any Vol in this &quot; before the long weekend , said another bond options floor broker . 
&quot; The only way they would ( is ) we would need to break below 110-12 / 32 , our three-week low . 
he said the September straddle stood at 7.95 percent versus 8.0 percent at Monday &apos;s settlement . 
the second broker instead expected continued steady erosion in volatility levels into Thursday &apos;s shortened futures trading session . 
&quot; Thursday , it &apos;s probably going to have a six-percent handle , &quot; he added . 
options turnover was calm , with no big size seen Tuesday . 
activity included a dealer that bought 1,000 August 112 calls at 23 / 64 . 
a Japanese-owned house bought 1,000 August 113 calls at 10 / 64 , and a commission house bought 1,000 107 10-year note puts at 12 / 64 . 
another dealer bought 2,000 lots of 112 / 113 call spreads in a one-by-two ratio , the brokers said .

softness in the manufacturing data drew dealer buying and persuaded locals to cover shorts , tugging September futures above a double-top at 111-23 / 32 and to 111-25 / 32 . 
futures subsequently ticked up to 111-29 / 32 after midday . 
but the floor broker said the move up in T-bond futures did little to stir up options , where vols actually had edged off slightly from Tuesday &apos;s opening by midday . 
he quoted the September 112 straddle at just below 8.0 percent versus about 8.15 percent at the opening . 
the August straddle hung a hair above 7.80 percent compared to about 7.80 percent open .
