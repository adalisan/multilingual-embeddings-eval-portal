plans by Singapore and Chicago to offer Taiwan stock index futures in January may make quick markets , but analysts say the island &apos;s own futures exchange would be ready to fight back when it opens in July . 
the Singapore International Monetary Exchange ( SIMEX ) , eyeing a gap opened by Taiwan &apos;s financial liberalisation but not yet filled by a long-awaited futures exchange , said on Wednesday it would launch futures and options linked to Taiwan &apos;s stock market performance . 
both will launch in early January with trading during Taiwan stock trading hours , but analysts predict Taiwan &apos;s own futures exchange , once it opens , will have strong advantages with which to woo business back . 
&quot; The physical cash market is here and a local market is free from foreign exchange risk , &quot; Steve Wang , president of Taipei &apos;s Grand Cathay futures , told Reuters on Wednesday . 
Wang said small Taiwan investors were likely to dominate the local market &apos;s index futures trading volume and , as a result , contracts linked to the Taiwan Stock Exchange &apos;s main Taiwan All Share Index ( TAIEX ) had the best chance of popular acceptance . 
Wang said the overseas futures , by contrast , would be linked to lesser-known indices that do not correlate identically to the TAIEX . 
the Taiwan Stock Exchange is not expected to authorise the CME or SIMEX to use the TAIEX , while the planned futures exchange , an affiliate of the stock exchange , will use it . 
several Taiwan futures brokers agreed , saying they expected the CME and SIMEX contracts to sell well initially due to strong demand from Taiwan and other Asian investors , but that they would face a serious challenge once the Taiwan futures exchange opens . 
eager to keep business at home , Taiwan is scrambling to open its exchange and launch products by July 1 . 
but it still faces a key obstacle -- the lack of a futures exchange law . 
a committee of the Legislative Yuan ( parliament ) has passed a draft law but the full parliament has yet to adopt final legislation . 
with the year-end recess just days away , analysts said the chances for the bill &apos;s imminent passage were fading . 
fearing that the futures exchange could be stalled , the Taiwan Stock Exchange is studying the software and hardware required to trade index options . 
options would not require a futures exchange law , but the securities exchange law would need to be redefined to include index options under the legal definition of securities . 
the local financial community has called for the government to allow stock index options in March , and sources said such options would be based on the TAIEX . 
legislator Lin Chung-chan , who has questioned options trade , said trading stock options on the stock exchange could create major risks if the clearing system was inadequate . 
&quot; Having no good clearance system in place is like a major financial scandal and crisis waiting to happen , &quot; Lin said .
