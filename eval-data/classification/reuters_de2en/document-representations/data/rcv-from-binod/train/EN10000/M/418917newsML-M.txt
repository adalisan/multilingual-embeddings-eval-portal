NYMEX access energy futures were narrowly mixed in overnight Monday trade , with little fundamental news to direct the market , traders said . 
&quot; It &apos;s pretty dead and featureless , &quot; one access broker said , noting volume was extremely light in petroleum products futures . 
at 1930 PST , heating oil futures for April traded down 0.03 cents a gallon from the daytime close of 53.18 cents . 
but at 1930 PST , the contract traded a razor-thin 37 lots for April , traders said . 
&quot; People are waiting for ( American Petroleum Institute ) data tomorrow , &quot; a broker said , explaining the light activity . 
despite crude &apos;s late recovery in daytime markets , access traders saw the contract continuiing to weaken Tuesday , with support around $ 20 a barrel . 
on access , crude drifted up two cents to $ 20.27 a barrel , with trade light at 188 lots in the front-month .
