new Zealand bond yields clawed back some of their losses in quiet Tuesday trade but finished short of last night &apos;s closing levels . 
short bond yields ended around two points above Monday &apos;s close , and longer bonds were off around four , after opening six or seven points weaker on the back of U.S. and Australian weakness . 
ninety day bills and September futures contracts failed to make the same progress , closing on their open at 9.97 percent and 90.13 respectively . 
&quot; With the treasuries falling away again , the market just got a bit of momentum on the negative side , but then domestic institutions started to nibble away and support it , &quot; a Wellington bond dealer said . 
&quot; Then one of the banks paid the 07 / 98s reasonably aggressively just before lunch , so that set off rumours about another euro or a samurai , but the currency fell away rather than got bid , so I just don &apos;t know how valid that rumour is at the moment , &quot; he said . 
any hint of a good rally was curbed by profit-taking in the afternoon and paying interest in the two to three year swap curve . 
dealers said they hoped for more activity in offshore markets overnight with the U.K. back on deck after a bank holiday today .
