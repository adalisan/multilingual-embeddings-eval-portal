Taiwan on Monday demanded that rival China immediately return a man detained earlier in the day for hijacking a Taiwan aircraft to the mainland , saying Taipei had the right to put him on trial . 
&quot; We have legal jurisdiction , &quot; Taiwan Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao said hours after the plane cross the Taiwan strait and touched down in Xiamen , Fujian province . 
&quot; The mainland authorities should return the hijacker immediately . 
Liao , speaking on Taiwan state-run television , said he had ordered prosecutors to prepare charges against the suspect , identified as jobless journalist Liu Shan-chung , 45 . 
Taiwan and China , bitter rivals since a civil war split them in 1949 , have often wrangled over jurisdiction following a spate of 12 hijackings in the early 1990s , all of which involved passenger planes commandeered to Taiwan from the mainland . 
the rivals , which refuse to recognise each other , agreed through semi-official talks in January 1995 to repatriate hijacked aircraft , their passengers and crew and the air pirates themselves but the agreement was never signed . 
Taiwan courts have convicted 16 mainland air pirates and all remain in prison on Taiwan . 
Taipei has declined to say whether they would be repatriated to face China &apos;s justice system -- and the possibility of execution -- after completing their terms .
