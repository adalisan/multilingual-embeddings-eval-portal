European stocks clawed back some losses by the close on Friday but remained badly rattled by sudden volatility on Wall Street after its recent record-breaking run . 
on currency markets , the dollar perked up slightly after drifting down against the mark . 
strong German economic data on Thursday dampened speculation of a cut in interest rates and boosted the German currency at the expenae of the dollar . 
London , Frankfurt and Paris , which have all hit peaks in recent weeks , showed big losses in early trade after New York posted a 1.32 percent decline at the close on Thursday . 
they regained some poise later but New York &apos;s unsteady start today did little to help . 
&quot; The feeling is that we are very much at the top of the range and the market is going to be volatile , &quot; said one dealer in London . 
Europe &apos;s major bourses , which have largely mirrored the bull run in New York , were unsettled by Wall Street &apos;s weakness which only two days ago touched a record of 7,067.46 on the Dow Jones average . 
wall Street see-sawed at the opening on Friday , edging finally into the plus column as European trade closed . 
&quot; We are not getting any indication at all of the market &apos;s underlying fundamentals . 
we are seeing a lot of high volatility being injected into the market , &quot; said a New York trader . 
London , Europe &apos;s biggest bourse , was badly hit by Wall Street , falling by 0.8 percent initially but recovering to close with losses of only 0.4 percent . 
&quot; Today &apos;s weakness has been all about Wall Street , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; It &apos;s been a hesistant day and we didn &apos;t see much business . 
&quot; People have been trying to push higher with the Dow this afternoon but there wasn &apos;t much enthusiasm , &quot; another commented . 
Frankfurt ended floor trading 11.94 points down at 3,184.09 on the DAX index after trading around one hundred points off recent record highs . 
the dollar &apos;s weakness , though stabilising during the session , also hurt exporters &apos; stocks . 
&quot; I really think this is just going to be just a little breather before we head on upwards again next week . 
I still think this market needs a correction , but there are still no real signs of it , &quot; he said . 
and after-hours transactions on the IBIS index picked up later in the session to show gains of 0.21 percent at the end . 
in Paris , almost every stock in the CAC-40 leading share index turned downwards in early trade but the market regained some poise and was down only a few points at the close . 
on the currency front , the dollar traded its way back to the levels of late Thursday in Europe after earlier sliding in lacklustre trading , keeping to narrow ranges of less than a pfenning and less than a yen . 
Stronger-than-expected German economic data on Thursday , a stronger yen and a recovery of the Swiss franc have added to the more subdued dollar tone in the last few sessions . 
&quot; The dollar had a fairly dull session , while the Swiss franc had quite a good day after its bad performance earlier in the week , &quot; said Lee Ferridge , currency strategist at Commerzbank in London . 
the Swiss franc regained some poise . 
after sinking to a three-year low of 1.4907 Swiss francs against the dollar on Wednesday , the Swiss currency has risen some 1.5 percent against the dollar and also gained on the mark . 
traders spent the morning awaiting the EU &apos;s ruling on Italy &apos;s controversial euro tax , designed to cut its budget deficit for monetary union . 
the tax was approved but it matched expectations and had scant impact on the lira . 
the dollar was quoted at 1.6880 marks and 123.20 yen compared to the 1.6895 and 123.07 in late European trade on Thursday . 
gold closed $ 353.75 an ounce , compared with $ 346.45 at the London close on Thursday . 
silver was at $ 5.26 in late trade , up six cents .
