Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien on Wednesday refused to comment on U.S. President Bill Clinton &apos;s re-election . 
Chretien snubbed reporters on his way to a regular Liberal Party parliamentary caucus . 
&quot; No scrum , &quot; he said , referring to the usual practice of reporters &apos; impromptu questioning of politicians outside the parliamentary chamber . 
later , his spokeswoman said that Chretien would not comment until the caucus was over . 
&quot; He doesn &apos;t have a comment right now . 
we don &apos;t have a comment until he &apos;ll scrum after ( the Liberal ) caucus , which is not going to be until noon ( est ) . 
&quot; Chretien &apos;s spokeswoman Leslie Swartman told Reuters by phone . 
Canada and the United States share the world &apos;s longest undefended border and are each other &apos;s largest trading partners . 
about $ 1 billion worth of goods crosses the border between the two countries each day . 
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said on his way to the Liberal caucus that Clinton &apos;s re-election was no surprise and that it was time to get down to business in the relationship between the two countries now that the campaign was over . 
&quot; We have good relations with Mr. Clinton and now we can address some of the important problems that have been pending until the election was over , &quot; Axworthy said . 
asked whether the election results would have any impact on the controversial Helms-Burton law , which punishes foreign investors for doing business with Cuba , Axworthy said it was too early to say . 
&quot; We have to be realistic about the Helms-Burton ( law ) . 
Mr. Helms remains and so does Mr. Burton . 
I think that maybe with the different composition of the U.S. Congress , there will be more dynamic for accommodation and compromise , &quot; Axworthy said . 
Canada has adopted its own legislation in retaliation to the Helms-Burton law .
