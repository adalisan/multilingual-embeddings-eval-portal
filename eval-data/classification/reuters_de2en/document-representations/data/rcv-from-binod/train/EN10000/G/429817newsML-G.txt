NATO and Russia have sketched the outlines of a deal on the alliance &apos;s planned eastwards enlargement , but major differences remain over Moscow &apos;s insistence of a freeze on new military installations , according to alliance diplomatic sources . 
&quot; This is now one of the main problems , the Russians simply don &apos;t understand how NATO works , &quot; said one alliance diplomat after the latest round of talks between the alliance and Russia on a new post-Cold War relationship . 
he said countries most likely to be invited to join the alliance at a special summit in Madrid in July -- Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic -- would modernise and upgrade their armed forces and military facilities anyway . 
&quot; This is something that would happen anyway , not because of NATO membership . 
these countries would want to upgrade their defence facilities . 
also , NATO is made up of national armies working together , &quot; added the diplomat . 
Russia has signalled it no longer has any objections to these countries joining the alliance as long as they get assurances no NATO infrastructure whatsoever would be moved eastwards , diplomats said . 
NATO cannot accept any demands that effectively would give the new members &quot; second class &quot; membership , but in reply has said it has no plans to station nuclear weapons or troops on the territory of the new members . 
in addition , the alliance &apos;s military says it must be free to adapt communications &apos; facilities and airfields to meet basic NATO standards . 
Russia said on Monday talks in Moscow on Sunday between NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and Russian Foreign Secretary Yevgeny Primakov had been &quot; positive &quot; , but acknowledged differences remained on &quot; a range of problems &quot; . 
Solana , speaking to reporters in the Kazakhstan capital Almaty after arriving from Moscow , said the talks were &quot; moving in the right direction &quot; , but he too added that there were still some problems . 
in Stockholm , an independent think-tank said a summit in Helsinki next week between presidents Bill Clinton of the United States and Boris Yeltsin could show Moscow giving grudging acceptance of NATO expansion into former Warsaw Pact countries . 
but the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute added in a new study that Russia would remain implaccably opposed to republics of the former Soviet Union , such as the Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania , joining the alliance . 
NATO diplomats said Russia had clearly decided it could not stop NATO &apos;s expansion later this year and was now trying to strike as good a deal as possible . 
they said Russia now appeared to have dropped its previous demand that any NATO-Russia document should be in the form of a legally binding treaty rather than a politically binding commitment from the alliance &apos;s 16 leaders . 
&quot; I think the Russians now accept the argument that such a treaty would be unwieldy , &quot; added the diplomat . 
Alliance sources said the plan , now broadly accepted by both sides , was to try and create a framework for consultation which could move towards &quot; mutual agreements &quot; over a broad range of areas . 
&quot; The trick for the alliance is to try and give the Russians co-decision without appearing to let them have a veto over alliance activities . 
that is a difficult circle to try and square , &quot; said one analyst . 
Solana left Moscow on Monday for Central Asia , but Assistant Secretary-General Gebhardt von Moltke stayed behind for a further day of negotiations with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasievsky . 
Alliance sources said the two men were trying to merge the different position papers presented by both sides into a single document . 
&quot; It will be full of brackets , but at least it will be one document and a basis for more negotiation , &quot; said another alliance diplomat . 
both sides are keen to make progress ahead of a summit in Helsinki on March 21 between Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin at which major steps towards a deal could be made .
