Danish share prices closed only slightly higher on Thursday but the top-20 KFX index hit a new end-of-day record nonetheless in defiance of Wall Street with dealers seeing moderate gains continuing up to the weekend . 
&quot; We expected to see a fall today in the wake of the U.S. decline , but individual banks and Novo kept the market up . 
some correction is on its way but not yet , if the Dow Jones rises tonight , we &apos;ll follow suit tomorrow , &quot; one dealer said . 
the KFX top-20 index finished 0.15 point up at 145.52 in overall bourse turnover of 2.045 billion crowns . 
the KFX March future rose 1.15 point to 146.40 with 30 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded . 
helping to bolster the market were some of the top banks , notably Unidanmark , which put on nine crowns to close at 367 , Jyske Bank which rose three crowns to 478 and Novo Nordisk , which ended three up at 556 .
