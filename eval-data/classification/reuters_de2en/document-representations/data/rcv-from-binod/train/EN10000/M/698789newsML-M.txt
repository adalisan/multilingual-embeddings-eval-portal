* AUD lost more of its rally offshore to lapse to $ 0.7505 as repeated upside attempts were frustrated by offers at $ 0.7540 * finely balanced as market waits to see if the RBA will ease this morning , first opportuntiy after Tuesday &apos;s board meeting 
* Some think RBA will hold until Thursday others see no cut at all . 
retail trade data today may help clarify the outlook 
traders said the currency had made a stab at the upside overnight but was smothered by fresh offers at US $ 0.7540 , which looked to be solidifying as good resistance now . 
the latter will surely be seen again if the RBA does decide to ease at its 9.30 am ( 2330 GMT ) money market operation , the usual window for a policy move . 
a half point cut would take official cash rates below their U.S. equivalent for the first time since financial makrets here were liberalised in 1983 . 
short term money rates began to enter this unfamiliar territory more than a month ago after the RBA surprised with its May 23 cut and dire employment and retail sales data suggested the economy was far more vulnerable than anyone had thought . 
the dollar had fallen all the way from 78 cents as a result and analysts saw a risk of reaching 73 cents , last year &apos;s trough , should it ease for a fifth time , although much depended on whether the market perceived this as the last of the cycle . 
if the market was confident the year-long easing cycle had truly ended the dollar could actually rally over the next few months . 
however , dealers had been burned by false dawns before , particularly in February and March when the dollar rallied 4-1 / 2 cents to an 80 cent peak only to turn tail when economic reality fell short of bullish expectations . 
equally , retail sales data for May should show if the market was right to have been so bearish in recent weeks . 
analysts look for a bounce of around 2.0 percent after April &apos;s shock 1.7 percent fall and anything less than 1.0 percent would be considered soft .
