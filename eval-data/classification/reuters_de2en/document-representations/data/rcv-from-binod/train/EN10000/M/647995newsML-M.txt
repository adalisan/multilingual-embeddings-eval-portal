Portuguese bonds were firm in early trade , buoyed by statements at the Ecofin meeting that the European single currency would start on time , dealers said . 
&quot; futures are rising a little with the rest of Europe after pledges at Ecofin that the euro will start in 1999 , &quot; said a fixed income analyst . 
a dealer said : &quot; Present spread levels of 70 to 80 bps ( against Bunds ) reflect caution pending more news about Ecofin . 
another fixed income analyst said : &quot; If the escudo remains under selling pressure against the mark , shorter bonds will not have much room to gain .
