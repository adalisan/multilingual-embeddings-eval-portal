an angry President Fidel Ramos on Wednesday ordered police to stop demolishing squatter huts near the Philippine presidential palace after a violent scuffle erupted between squatters and demolition workers . 
Ramos was meeting with a group of slum dwellers when government wrecking crews began demolishing shanties in a nearby squatter colony , sparking scuffles in which 15 people were injured , officials said . 
local mayors have ordered the destruction of many squatter huts as part of a campaign to beautify Manila ahead of next month &apos;s summit meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum . 
demolition workers swung iron bars at protesting housewives while an unidentified resident hurled a home-made bomb at the wreckers , witnesses said . 
mothers and their children wailed as their huts , mostly made of wood and iron sheets , went crashing down . 
children linked arms in a futile attempt to stop the destruction . 
Ramos , in a directive to Interior Secretary Robert barbers and housing agency officials , demanded to know why the demolition was timed to coincide with his meeting with the slum dwellers . 
&quot; My scheduled dialogue with the urban poor is being subverted by these actions , &quot; Ramos said . 
the shanties have been thorny subject ahead of the summit of 18 leaders of APEC member economies to be held in nearby Subic freeport on November 25 . 
the summit will be preceded by a week of ministerial conferences in Manila . 
local mayors have intensified demolition of squatter colonies around the capital after Ramos in June berated them for failing to remove &quot; eyesores , &quot; including street vendors , uncollected garbage and clogged river channels . 
Ramos has emphasised the need to upgrade the country &apos;s image , saying the APEC summit was the best time &quot; to show our neighbouring economies the progress we have made &quot; . 
he did not , however , specifically refer to squatter shanties . 
leaders of slum communities around Manila said about 16,000 families living along routes where delegates to the forthcoming APEC summit would pass would be affected by demolitions . 
government officials have said , however , that the demolitions were not part of APEC preparations . 
many squatters oppose being transferred to government relocation sites in the suburbs , saying they are overcrowded and unsanitary and there are no jobs near the relocation areas . 
Trining de la Cruz , one of the leaders of the squatters group which met Ramos , told the president in a letter they were told the demolition was being carried out on his orders . 
&quot; They said we are the garbage of society ... that this was your order for the sake of APEC , &quot; Herrera said in her letter . 
Ramos denied at the meeting that he had issued any such orders .
