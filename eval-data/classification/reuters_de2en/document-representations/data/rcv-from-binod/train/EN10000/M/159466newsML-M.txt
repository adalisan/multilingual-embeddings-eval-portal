strong demand from banks and institutions for liquid assets should keep the lid on South African Treasury bill rates at Friday &apos;s auction , despite a sharp rise in the money market shortage and higher money market rates . 
dealers predicted the average three-month T-bill rate would rise only slightly above 15 percent from 14.95 percent last week . 
although there had been a 30 basis point rise in the three-month bankers &apos; acceptance ( BA ) rate to between 15.85 and 15.70 percent in the last week , this would be countered by strong demand for liquid assets , they said . 
&quot; There is so much demand for T-bills from the institutions that the rate will be kept right down . 
I don &apos;t see it moving ( up ) much more than five basis points ( from last week ) , &quot; said one money market trader . 
the Reserve Bank indicated the daily shortage at 9.69 billion rand on Thursday from 8.667 billion rand on Wednesday -- a sharp rise which dealers attributed to month-end pressures and an outflow of funds following the rand &apos;s tumble this week .
