the Singapore high sulphur fuel oil market edged down on Tuesday over concerns that buying support from a local trader may not continue , traders said . 
a 20,000-tonne 380-cst cargo exchanged hands at $ 95.50 per tonne for early August lifting , compared with the last traded level at $ 97.00 last week . 
offers for the 180-cst grade were heard as low as $ 96.50 per tonne but there was no buying interest , traders said . 
&quot; Even the gas oil is very cheap now . 
the spread between the two grades should not be so small , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; The local trader may have finished its recent purchases . 
the local trader has bought over 12 cargoes since late June . 
&quot; He wants to sustain the market but not to push up prices , &quot; said another trader . 
traders noted sufficient supplies , despite fewer export cargoes from Kuwait in the summer season , and a lack of demand from China and India . 
&quot; majors want to sell and Taiwan and Sri Lanka want to sell as well , but there is no fresh demand . 
prices have started to be under pressure , &quot; said the first trader . 
Sri Lanka &apos;s state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corp ( CPC ) said it would award a tender on Wednesday to sell 18,000-20,000 tonnes of 180-cst fuel oil for lifting July 22-23 . 
Taiwan &apos;s state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp ( CPC ) may also award a tender , which closed today , on Wednesday to sell 30,000 tonnes of 3.0-percent sulphur 180-cst fuel oil for August 1-5 lifting . 
in the low sulphur waxy residue ( LSWR ) market , sentiment remained firm with tighter supplies in July but traders said they did not expect major gains and saw prices moving around the $ 16.50-per-barrel level in the near term .
