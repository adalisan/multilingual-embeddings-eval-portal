hog futures traded on both sides of previous levels during the day and rallied again late as follow-through selling was lacking despite calls for steady to weak cash hog markets again Tuesday . 
futures had rallied from early losses and set new highs as buy stops were touched before falling to new day &apos;s lows . 
values then rallied again as follow-through selling was lacking , traders said . 
the Taiwan pork ban and expectations of increased demand for U.S. pork to fill the gap again proved an underlying supportive factor , they said . 
&quot; The trade is going to continue to wait to see if Japan imports pick up based on Taiwan , &quot; said Don Roose , president of U.S. commodities Inc . 
Roose also looks for more erratic trade based on the premium of futures to cash hog prices and expected uneven cash action ahead based on seasonal factors . 
spring planting will influence hog marketings at times , he and others noted .
