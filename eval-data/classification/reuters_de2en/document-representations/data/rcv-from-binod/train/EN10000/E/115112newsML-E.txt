the German economy will show significantly higher growth in the third quarter than the 1.2 percent year-on-year growth seen in the second quarter , the economics ministry said on Monday . 
private sector economists also said they had been revising their forecasts upward , based on strong industrial output and export orders data , but warned with the ministry that higher growth would do little to help Germany &apos;s four million jobless . 
Third-quarter growth on a year-on-year basis could be as strong as two percent , boosting growth for the whole of 1996 well above the government &apos;s official forecast of 0.75 percent to 1.0 percent , they said . 
&quot; Market expectations of continued weak growth are simply overdone , &quot; said Holger Schmieding at Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt . 
&quot; Many people keep using the refrain of sluggish growth and no inflation , but sluggish growth is something we are clearly not having . 
Schmieding sees 1996 growth at 1.5 percent , rising to 2.6 percent in 1997 and 3.5 percent in 1998 . 
Michael Clauss at CS First Boston in London said he saw 1996 growth at 1.4 percent , accelerating to 2.6 in 1997 . 
unresolved structural problems continued to weigh on the economy , however , and an unexpectedly sharp rise in unemployment in September showed all was not well , Clauss said . 
after a 1.5 percent leap in gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the second quarter from the previous quarter , quarterly growth will slow to about 0.7 percent in the third quarter as domestic demand and investment remain weak , Clauss said . 
the economic improvement since the second quarter marks a turnaround from a pronounced slowdown late in 1995 and at the start of this year . 
economists generally blame high 1995 pay rises and the robust mark for the halt in growth . 
Schmieding &apos;s scenario for the next two years sees the mark falling sharply to about 1.70 to the dollar from the current 1.53 as momentum builds for European economic and monetary union ( EMU ) and the launch of a single currency in January 1999 . 
the weaker mark will spark demand for German exports , fuelling faster overall growth , he believes . 
&quot; This Bundesbank is so pro-EMU they don &apos;t care about the rest . 
as long as inflation remains below two percent , they will retain an easing bias no matter what happens on growth , &quot; Schmieding said . 
the labour market was likely to begin to benefit early next year , he added . 
the economics ministry &apos;s monthly report remained gloomy on the jobs front , saying the export-led recovery after the winter economic slowdown was still not rapid or broad enough to alleviate high unemployment . 
&quot; The pace and breadth of economic growth clearly are not yet enough to achieve lasting improvement in the jobs market , &quot; the report said . 
although the economy is recovering , many forecasters say Germany may enter another phase of &quot; jobless growth &quot; in which an economy with too many obstacles to investment fails to create new jobs in place of those lost in the last slowdown . 
&quot; We have a no-jobs-growth scenario , like the U.S. in the early 1990s , &quot; Clauss said . 
the ministry said domestic investment was slack , failing to show the drive of previous recoveries . 
but supply-side measures under the government &apos;s Programme for More Jobs and Growth austerity plan should lay better ground for growth , it said . 
monthly data showed that manufacturing output recovered further in the third quarter , with confidence brightening in both western Germany and the former communist east . 
but the building industry remains depressed and the jobless trend remains upward . 
unemployment in September , at 3.85 million , was over 300,000 up against a year earlier . 
the ministry expects to release data on third-quarter GDP growth in the first half of December .
