Israeli shares closed higher on Thursday on rising volume led by a rise in small capitalisation shares , traders said . 
the benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares gained 1.06 percent , or 2.58 points , to 245.78 on an all-share turnover of 136 million shekels against 110 million shekels on Wednesday . 
the Maof 25 blue chip index closed 1.11 percent higher at 253.89 . 
&quot; The session opened with nice gains and the indices rose by more than 1.5 percent led by a sharp rise in small capitalisation shares traded on the Karam index . 
but by midday the trend changed and the market weakened , &quot; said a trader at Bank Leumi . 
&quot; There was no evident reason for the change and the market continues to be very volatile , &quot; said Doron Tsur , head of research at Sahar Securities . 
&quot; I think the market rose today because it had fallen sharply and now it &apos;s time for a technical correction . 
&quot; The positive fact was that the volume rose today but it &apos;s too early to talk about a real change as investors are still waiting for release of the last earning reports , &quot; Tsur added . 
traders added that foreign investors were active today buying shares . 
Africa Israel Investments rose 3.75 percent to 23,193 agorot . 
traders termed the rise a technical rebound after the share suffered heavy losses during the last few weeks . 
the company reported on Thursday that net profit fell in fourth-quarter 1996 to 8.4 million shekels from 29.1 million a year earlier . 
the most active shares were Bank Leumi , which rose 2.0 percent to 548 agorot on turnover of 13.9 million shekels ; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries , which gained 1.0 percent to 18,627 agorot on volume of 12.4 million shekels ; and Bank Hapoalim , which gained 1.75 percent to 642 agorot on volume of 8.9 million shekels .
