Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila urged civilians on Thursday to stay in rebel-held areas and said President Mobutu Sese Seko was dreaming if he thought he could recapture them . 
in a speech on rebel Star Radio aimed at stemming an exodus of frightened civilians from the eastern city of Goma , Kabila said rebel forces could defeat any Zairean army counter-attack . 
&quot; We want to assure you that your security remains absolutely and irreversibly guaranteed , &quot; said Kabila , president of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo / Zaire ( ADFL ) . 
&quot; We are in this liberated territory from Fizi ( in the south ) to Beni ( in the north ) and we are here to stay .... Mr &apos; fantastic &apos; Mobutu might attempt to recapture his lost lands , but he is dreaming and he has no idea of our determination , &quot; Kabila said . 
hundreds of Goma residents have fled Goma this week , saying they feared they would be killed in any assault by Mobutu &apos;s army and they doubted rebels could successfully defend the city they seized in early November . 
in his first act since returning from four months in Europe for cancer treatment Mobutu named a new army chief of staff on Wednesday , bringing back a commander well tested on the field of battle . 
State television , announcing the appointment of General Mahele Bokoungo Lieko , said the move was intended to help Zaire &apos;s demoralised army meet the challenge of the Tutsi-led revolt in the east . 
a close friend of Mobutu , who asked to remain anonymous , said military hardware , including 15 helicopters and several fighter jets , had been brought into Zaire in the past three weeks , accompanied by 154 foreign military personnel . 
he declined to give details on their origin . 
the Rwandan-backed rebels have seized a swathe of territory about 500-km ( 300-miles ) long from north to south since October . 
Zairean troops , looting as they fled , put up very little resistance . 
&quot; I believe it is also important to tell you Walikale fell two days ago , &quot; Kabila said . 
aid workers however said the town , 130-km ( 80-miles ) west of Goma , remained in government hands . 
more than 600,000 Rwandan refugees returned to Rwanda from the east during the rebellion but many others fled deeper into eastern Zaire and aid agencies are struggling to reach them . 
the U.N. World Food Programme ( WFP ) said on Thursday for the first time it flew food into eastern Zaire beyond rebel lines when a Boeing 707 made two flights to the city of Kisangani on Wednesday . 
&quot; The plane made two flights to Kisangani and brought in a total of 20 tonnes of high protein biscuits and 58 tonnes of maize meal , &quot; said WFP spokeswoman Michelle Quintaglie . 
she said WFP planned to use trucks or small planes to take the food to the Lubutu area to the south and had sent in three foreign staff to assess the situation in Lubutu and Walikale . 
U.N. officials said on Tuesday they had received reports of fighting on the outskirts of Walikale and that access to Rwandan refugees in the Walikale area was virtually impossible . 
U.N. sources said between 50,000 and 100,000 mostly Rwandan refugees had been sighted at Tingi-Tingi , seven-km ( four-miles ) from Lubutu , which was still in government hands . 
the sources said the refugees were organising themselves in camps with an internal structure similar to their camps around Goma which the refugees were forced to leave in late October .
