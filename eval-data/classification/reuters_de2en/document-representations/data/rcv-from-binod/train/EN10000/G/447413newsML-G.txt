a high-level European team flew to Albania on Monday to assess how to help the new government end the anarchy in the Balkan state . 
the 11-strong team , led by Dutch roving ambassador Jan de Marchant et d &apos;Ansembourg , left for the capital Tirana by Italian military helicopter from the southern port of Brindisi after preparatory talks at the Foreign Ministry in Rome . 
diplomatic sources said the team was due during its two-day stay to meet new Prime Minister Bashkim Fino and his ministers as well as visit the troubled ports of Durres and rebel-held Vlore , both key bridgeheads in any inflow of humanitarian aid . 
the sources said no meeting had been planned with embattled President Sali Berisha , who earlier said he would ask the delegation to provide police , food and economic aid . 
&quot; We will request a major assistance to rebuild our institutions , also a very quick humanitarian assistance ... and economic aid , &quot; Berisha told French Europe 1 radio . 
diplomatic sources said the team would pave the way for a European Union advisory mission of up to 150 experts that would help Albania &apos;s broad-based government restore security and distribute emergency food relief and medical supplies . 
the mission , likely to be finalised by European Union foreign ministers at a meeting in Brussels next Monday , would have a limited police and military component for its own security and logistics , the sources said . 
EU foreign ministers , who met informally in the Netherlands at the weekend , declined an Albanian appeal for military intervention to end the impoverished country &apos;s armed chaos . 
but they said in a statement that they were &quot; strongly committed to helping Albania restore civilian structures and law and order . 
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini , who has been at the forefront of diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis , told the team in Rome that their task was to assess the security situation and relief needs in Albania . 
&quot; What is needed for Albania is a global approach to help restore an acceptable security environment , &quot; Dini said . 
&quot; This is an essential condition for the implementation of a rapid rehabilitation of the institutional functions and of the economy as well as for quick humanitarian and infrastructural relief , &quot; one diplomat quoted Dini as saying . 
the team , led by the Netherlands as holder of the EU presidency , includes representatives from Italy , Greece , the European Commission and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 
Albania , Europe &apos;s poorest country , has been rocked by unrest since the collapse in January of shady pyramid savings schemes . 
the protests mushroomed this month into armed rebellion in the south and chaos has since spread across the tiny state . 
insurgents are in control of several southern towns , including the port of Vlore . 
it would be used with the port of Durres and Tirana airport -- closed now for five days -- in any European humanitarian operation . 
the sources said the de Marchant team would seek security guarantees from the government and the Vlore rebels for the planned EU operation at the three sites but acknowledged that some foreign security presence could be needed . 
they said the team would also advise Fino that the European Union would ask international financial institutions to send a fact-finding mission to Albania to lay the ground for short-term financial aid and a plan to revitalise the country &apos;s economy .
