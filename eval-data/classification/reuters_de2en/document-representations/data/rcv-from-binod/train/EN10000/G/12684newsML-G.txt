reports of repeated persecution of opposition parties in Bosnia &apos;s Moslem Bihac region are tarnishing the democratic image of President Alija Izetbegovic &apos;s party , Western observers say . 
international peace coordinator Carl Bildt visited the area in northwest Bosnia on Friday to rebuke regional bosses of the ruling Party of Democratic Action ( SDA ) after 28 incidents of pre-election bombings and beatings this month . 
Western diplomats and monitors say that SDA authorities , embittered by Serb conquests of Moslem-inhabited north and east Bosnia and the Serbs &apos; retention of that land under the U.S.-imposed Dayton treaty , have swung the party towards authoritarian Moslem nationalism in peacetime . 
however officially the party &apos;s ethos is one of multi-cultural democracy . 
one of Bildt &apos;s aides , who asked not to be identified , said : &quot; Bihac was a symbol of bravery in the war . 
we &apos;ve asked the SDA if it now wants Bihac to become a symbol of human rights abuses in peace , and forego chances for redevelopment aid . 
the Bihac canton police minister said he had sacked the police chief of Cazin , the second largest municipality in the region of 250,000-odd Moslems where most attacks had occurred . 
Bildt said the steps were needed to foster a climate of free expression in the run up to Western-organised elections to be staged across Bosnia on September 14 . 
voters will be electing joint governing institutions meant to weld Moslem , Serb and Croat sectors of Bosnia back together again , undoing the results of 43 months of war . 
but the intolerance of ruling parties in all three camps have raised fears that the vote will only ratify , not reverse , the violent partition of Bosnia . 
Western mediators and monitors are especially disillusioned by events in Bihac because the SDA , unlike Serb and Croat counterparts , waged the war on the principle of ethnic pluralism dedicated to reunifying Bosnia . 
the Bihac &quot; pocket &quot; , as it was known during the war , became a byword for doughty resistance to besieging Serbs , barely surviving their blockade of U.N. humanitarian convoys . 
sources close to Bildt blamed much of the violence on agents of a shadowy internal security service run by the SDA or thugs linked to the SDA-run local police . 
&quot; We hope they and their superiors in Sarajevo will get the message now we &apos;ve shone a high-level , high-pressure spotlight on them , &quot; said the Bildt aide . 
Western monitors , Bihac opposition leaders and their faithful fear Bildt &apos;s intercession may have been too late to dispel an atmosphere of fear in the region . 
while being interviewed , pro-opposition citizens glance edgily at passers by , some of whom stop to stare and eavesdrop . 
&quot; People are afraid to speak frankly in the streets . 
&quot; In Our Own Religion , In Our Own Land &quot; stands out from SDA campaign posters which plaster building facades throughout the region to the almost total exclusion of opposition advertising . 
opposition leaders told Reuters their placards were being ripped down by SDA men as soon as they were put up . 
they said they were being refused access to public halls for meetings . 
that forced them to convene occasionally outdoors where they could be assaulted with impunity . 
&quot; All this reflects the fact that opposition sentiment may be stronger in the Bihac region than anywhere else in SDA-ruled Bosnia , &quot; a European Union monitor said .
