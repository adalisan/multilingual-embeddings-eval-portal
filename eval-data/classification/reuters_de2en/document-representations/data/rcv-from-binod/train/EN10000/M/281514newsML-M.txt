the UK &apos;S FTSE 100 index on Tuesday hit a record close of 4,118.5 on the truncated last session of 1996 , its fifth new closing peak of the past month and giving a gain of 11.6 percent from the end of 1995 . 
the increase compares with the FTSE 100 &apos;s 20.3 percent gain in 1995 and its 10.0 percent decline in 1994 , yet is well below the 35 percent rise in 1989 -- the index &apos;s best annual performance since it was created in January 1984 .
