a French humanitarian relief group plans to dump 40 tonnes of food supplies , the equivalent of the load aboard a single cargo aircraft , on a major Paris square on Saturday to protest against delays in helping refugees in Zaire . 
the group Secours Catholique ( Catholic Rescue ) said it would unload the cargo on the Square of Human Rights near the Eiffel Tower &quot; to denounce the situation in which we are prevented from bringing the aid to the refugees &quot; . 
Secours Catholique said &quot; only immediate intervention by the international community can save the lives of hundreds of thousands of victims in this drama . 
relief groups pulled out of eastern Zaire this week because of anarchy resulting from ethnic fighting and France has called on the international community to mount a military-assisted rescue operation . 
on Friday in Geneva , the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross , Cornelio Sommaruga , urged military intervention to help aid agencies gain safe access to the million refugees fleeing in east Zaire . 
in Rome , Catherine Bertini , executive director of the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , said more than 80,000 children under the age of three will die in eastern Zaire by the end of the month unless humanitarian aid corridors were opened to starving refugees .
