the United States warned Turkey against attacking Cyprus after reports from Ankara on Thursday that Turkey was seriously considering a military strike . 
&quot; This is no time for the Turkish government to be making wild and dramatic statements which will not be supported by any sensible member of the international community . 
it would be completely out of bounds for Turkey to take this action , &quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters . 
Turkey &apos;s state-run news agency said Thursday that Ankara was seriously considering a military strike if Cyprus went ahead with plans to deploy Russian anti-aircraft missiles . 
burns was commenting on reports of remarks Wednesday by Turkish Defence Minister Turhan Tayan that Turkey would use all possible means to halt the missile deployment . 
&quot; We hope very much that this report ... is incorrect . 
we hope it does not reflect in any way shape or form the views of the Turkish government , &quot; he told reporters . 
&quot; There can be no question that Turkey must respect the rules of the road here , which are no country , and specifically in this case Turkey , should threaten the use of military force against Cyprus ; no country , specifically here Turkey , should undertake military force against Cyprus , &quot; he said . 
Washington has condemned Cyprus for the Russian missile deal , but Burns said the system will not be deployed for at least 16 months .
