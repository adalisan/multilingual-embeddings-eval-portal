Norway international Gunnar Halle joined Leeds on Monday in a reported 400,000 pounds ( $ 658,000 ) transfer from first division Oldham . 
Halle was on the point of signing for Leeds when Howard Wilkinson lost his job as manager in September and the deal fell through . 
but new boss George Graham -- who missed out on the signing of John scales when the Liverpool defender opted instead for Tottenham -- revived the club &apos;s interest and signed the player on a 2-1 / 2 years deal . 
&quot; I &apos;m pleased to have captured my first signing , particularly one so experienced as Gunnar Halle , &quot; said Graham . 
Halle moved to Oldham from Lillestrom in 1990 and has won 52 caps for Norway . 
he can play in either full-back position or midfield .
