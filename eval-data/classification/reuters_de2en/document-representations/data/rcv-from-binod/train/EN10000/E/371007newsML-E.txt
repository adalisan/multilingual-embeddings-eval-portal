Thai central bank governor Rerngchai Marakanond said on Tuesday that a government decision to cut 99 billion baht from fiscal 1996 / 1997 spending would slow economic growth slightly but help narrow the current account deficit . 
he said that 1997 economic growth could be cut by about 0.3 percent from a projected 7.1 percent while the current account deficit for this year was set to narrow to 7.4 percent of gross domestic product from 7.9 percent projected earlier . 
&quot; The budget cuts once again confirm Thailand &apos;s policy of putting highest priority on economic stability , &quot; Rerngchai told a briefing after the announcement that the cabinet had decided to make the spending cuts . 
&quot; lately we have achieved stability especially in the CPI which has eased ... Now we have to sacrifice some aspects of growth as a tradeoff to achieve current account stability , &quot; he added . 
he said the projects affected by the spending cuts were those with high import content .
