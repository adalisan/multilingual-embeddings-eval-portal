bankers Trust New Zealand said on Tuesday its monetary conditions index fell slightly to average 127.5 in August from 131 in July . 
falls in both 90-day bank bills and the New Zealand dollar Trade-Weighted Index contributed to the lower index . 
the level of 127.5 was still well above the 118.5 for the September quarter implied by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand &apos;s assumptions in its latest Monetary Policy Statement in June . 
BTNZ said it expected the RBNZ to assume monetary conditions roughly in line with current levels when it releases its next economic forecasts on September 13 , reflecting the uncertainty of fiscal policy after next month &apos;s general eelction . 
the central bank &quot; has tolerated a significant tightening in monetary conditions in 1996 &quot; , BTNZ said . 
this reflected , in part , stronger than expected activity data and a worsening short-term inflation outlook .
