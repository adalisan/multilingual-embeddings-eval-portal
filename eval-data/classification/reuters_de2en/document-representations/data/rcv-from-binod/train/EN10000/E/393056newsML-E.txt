Romania will use its monetary levers to fight rising inflation , restore confidence in the leu and put the economy and market reforms on track , the head of the central bank ( BNR ) said on Thursday . 
Mugur Isarescu told a news conference tough monetary policy , an austerity budget and structural reforms , would help Romania achieve macro-economic stability and win the support of international lenders . 
&quot; This is the first time we are taking the bull by the horns , &quot; Isarescu said of a government package announced this week aimed at winning loans of about $ 1.0 billion from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank . 
Romania &apos;s new centrist coalition government , which ousted ex-communists in last November &apos;s elections , pledged to cut bulging budget and trade deficits , speed up privatisation and slim down Communist-era industries . 
Isarescu said the central bank was determined to mop up excess money supply to restore confidence in the leu , which has sunk to about 9,000 per dollar from 4,000 in the New Year . 
&quot; We will control money supply through tough control over reserve money , the core of broad money , &quot; Isarescu said . 
reserve money , also known as high-powered money , includes cash in circulation and in vaults and banks &apos; minimum reserves . 
President Emil Constantinescu &apos;s coalition pledged in the election to bridge the gap which has left reforms far behind those in ex-communist Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic . 
this week &apos;s programme emerged from a month of talks with senior IMF officials who complained that the ex-communists who ran Romania after the 1989 execution of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu had consistently failed to deliver on promises . 
the central bank has already started to drain liquidity from the market to create &quot; leu hunger &quot; . 
short-term money market rates have climbed to 160 percent from 52 in early January . 
&quot; The central bank is aiming for those who keep their leu to have substantial gains this year , &quot; he said . 
Isarescu said money supply growth in the months ahead would be below inflation rates . 
he said a &quot; blip &quot; of price rises would continue for some months following the freeing of prices for fuel , electicity and food , introduced from this week . 
&quot; Monthly inflation will slow in the last quarter of 1997 , when we can start a process under which money supply growth will exceed inflation , &quot; he said . 
monthly inflation soared to 13.7 percent in January from 10.3 percent last December and is forecast to slow to about 2.2 percent by end-1997 . 
Isarescu said he hoped the leu &apos;s depreciation this year would be lower than inflation , which he estimated at a year-on-year 89.5 percent , compared to 56.9 percent in 1996 . 
the leu &apos;s rate , he said , would be set strictly by market forces after the BNR removed market curbs this week . 
licences were issued to 24 banks to act as market makers alongside the only four banks empowered to do so for most of the past year . 
Isarescu said that despite some &quot; disorderly moves &quot; in the in the next few days the market would eventually eliminate large gaps between dealers and integrate prices . 
&quot; It is a war of attrition but it will clearly subside , &quot; he said .
