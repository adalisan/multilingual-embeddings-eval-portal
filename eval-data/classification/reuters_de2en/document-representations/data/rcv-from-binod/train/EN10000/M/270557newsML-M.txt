base metals prices seem to be gathering steam for another rally like the one seen from 1993 to 1995 , when prices gained 102 percent on average , broker Rudolf Wolff said . 
&quot; The same scenario now looks set to unfold again , &quot; analyst William Adams said in a report . 
&quot; With base metal stocks for most of the metals approaching critically low levels , or in the case of lead and copper below critical levels , a combination of supply deficits and stronger demand should underpin firmer metal prices , &quot; he said . 
world economic growth is expected to grow at 4.00 percent next year , which would be the highest since 1988 , with low inflation and interest rates providing a strong incentive for economies to expand , Adams said . 
&quot; Many of the metals are facing a supply / demand deficit in 1997 and 1998 , and considering the trade have been destocking in 1996 , an improvement in the order flow of semi-fabricated products should be quickly reflected in higher demand for metal , &quot; the report said . 
in addition , if fund managers believe the upside potential in stocks and bonds is limited , they may reallocate resources into commodities , Adams added . 
but some metals will do better than others . 
copper prices will lag , just as zinc did in 1993-1995 , since the relatively high copper price over the past several years stimulated investment in new projects , keeping the market well supplied . 
&quot; That said , there is some uncertainty over Chinese requirements and copper could still remain a bull market if China restocks heavily , &quot; the report said . 
copper stocks are expected to rise above critical levels in 1997 , but not by a large margin . 
tin , lead and zinc stocks are expected to fall below important levels in 1997 , while aluminium &apos;s and nickel &apos;s stocks are forecast to drop , but not below key levels .
