Irish Finance Minister Ruairi Quinn targetted a 1997 Exchequer borrowing Requirement ( EBR ) of 637 million punts , 1.6 percent of Gross National Product ( GNP ) , in his budget speech on Wednesday . 
economists &apos; forecasts for the post-budget EBR ranged from 585 million punts to 755 million . 
the 1996 current budget was in surplus to the tune of 292 million as against an expected deficit of 82 million punts . 
Quinn said he had made provisions for a current budget surplus of 193 million pounds in 1997 , equivalent to 0.5 percent of GNP . 
he also pencilled in a General Government Deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP , well below the three percent limit set by the Maastricht Treaty . 
&quot; This is the first time ever that a Minister of Finance has planned for a significant current budget surplus , &quot; Quinn said in his budget speech to parliament . 
&quot; And I am projecting a surplus not just for one year , 1997 , but for 1998 and 1999 as well . 
Quinn said taking account of departmental balances of 26 million pounds and increased capital receipts of 20 million pounds , the opening EBR for 1997 is 334 million Irish pounds .
