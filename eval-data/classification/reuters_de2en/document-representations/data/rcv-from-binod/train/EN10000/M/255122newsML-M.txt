oil prices rebounded Friday as forecasts for colder weather across much of the country boosted demand for heating fuel . 
the forecast also lifted orange juice prices on fears freezing weather would reach Florida &apos;s orange groves . 
coffee prices also rose . 
over two days , oil prices made up nearly half the ground lost early in the week when Iraq was cleared to resume exports and inventory statistics showed refiners increasing output . 
&quot; All indications point to an extended period of cold weather for much of the nation from the Rockies to the East Coast &quot; starting next week through the end of December , Jon Davis , weather forecaster at Smith Barney , said in a report . 
on the New York Mercantile Exchange , January crude oil jumped 75 cents to $ 24.47 a barrel , though the contract still lost $ 1.18 on the week . 
January heating oil jumped 3.04 cents to 71.71 cents a gallon , and January gasoline rose 2.32 cents to 67.04 cents a gallon . 
January natural gas rallied to a new contract high of $ 3.851 for 1,000 cubic feet , up 32.2 cents . 
&quot; People were getting pretty excited about this cold weather coming in , &quot; said Tom Bentz of ING Derivatives . 
he noted that there have been previous cold spells and a number weeks of above-normal temperatures in the past couple of months and the net result has been rising production and inventories of key products like heating oil . 
still , relatively tight stocks of heating oil and natural gas heading into the winter has provided a bullish backdrop for energy prices . 
several analysts said Iraq &apos;s re-emergence as an exporter would weigh on prices . 
&quot; The real key feature is that we will have additional Iraqi oil on the world market shortly and overwhelmingly that should be bearish , &quot; Corey Bell of Dean Witter said . 
Iraqi oil should reach the market over the weekend as agreed under the United Nations-approved oil-for-food deal that eased sanctions placed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait . 
meanwhile , orange juice prices rose on the chance the cold snap will hit Florida and endanger the groves . 
&quot; There is a one-in-six chance of a cold front next week and into the following week in the citrus area of Florida , &quot; Judy Ganes of Merrill Lynch said . 
&quot; It &apos;s causing some nervousness in the market . 
Davis of Smith Barney said the threat of cold weather in Florida would have to be watched late next week . 
March orange juice rose 1.50 cents to 96 cents a pound at the New York Cotton Exchange . 
coffee prices turned volatile , with most of the gains focused on the spot December contract that expires on Wednesday . 
&quot; If we didn &apos;t have December pulling this market up , I am not sure where we would be , &quot; one trader said . 
the number of December contracts outnumbered the amount of physical coffee certified for delivery , causing some of the volatility , traders and analysts said . 
December coffee jumped 6 cents to 129.40 cents a pound at the Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange . 
after the close of trading , the Agriculture Department raised its estimate of next year &apos;s coffee production . 
its prediction of world production was nearly 2 percent above its June projection at 101 million 132-pound bags . 
last season , global production was 90 million bags .
