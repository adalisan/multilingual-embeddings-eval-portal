Members of the European Union &apos;s grain committee on Thursday discussed plans to open a tender next week for the export of 100,000 tonnes of EU free-market durum wheat to countries outside the EU , EU grain officials said . 
industry sources said the European Union , after a bumper durum wheat crop , would like to step up its presence on export markets but has been prevented from doing so by firm domestic prices . 
in some EU countries durum wheat prices are currently 30-40 percent above intervention prices but the EU has no intervention stocks to bring prices under control . 
the EU is hoping for indications on the value of European durum wheat on world markets from the export offers that may be submitted at the tender .
