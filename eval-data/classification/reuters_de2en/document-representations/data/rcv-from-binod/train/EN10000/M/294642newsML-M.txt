coffee - Robusta futures in London rebounded from earlier lows towards the close on industry and trade short-covering triggered by New York &apos;s advance and reports that Brazil &apos;s 1997 / 98 crop will not be higher than between 18.5 and 19.5 million 60-kg bags . 
earlier projections put the crop at between 17.8 and 30 million bags . 
January added $ 17 to close at 1,249 per tonne while March added $ 18 to close at $ 1,227 per tonne . 
in New York arabica futures rallied sharply on fund buying . 
the rise was prompted by another report from Brazil detailing a low 1997 / 98 crop figure of under 20 million bags compared to 1996 / 97 output of 26 million bags . 
if production would actually turn out to be below 20 million bags , supplies must be expected to remain tight throughout the year . 
there was also some talk that rains in Minas Gerais have been excessive and some areas might be &apos; flooded &apos; . 
traders remain skeptical , that the Brazilian crop will actually be below 20 million bags and said that with favourable weather prospects could improve . 
Mexico - Mexico exported 320,483 bags of coffee in November 1996 , 8 percent more than was exported the same month the previous year . 
that brought total exports since the beginning of 1996 / 97 ( October / September ) up to 484,332 bags , 13 per cent more than the 428,422 bags shipped the same two months in 1995 . 
that brought total imports since the beginning of 1996 to 2.256 million bags , nearly 10 percent more than was imported the same period in 1995 . 
total imports in calendar year 1995 dropped by 18 per cent to 2.783 million bags . 
main suppliers of green coffee in January / September 1996 were Costa Rica ( 186,300 vs 249,400 bags ) , Colombia ( 198,500 vs 138,500 bags ) and Indonesia ( 252,100 vs 188,700 bags ) . 
the country exported 420,400 bags of coffee in January / September 1996 , nearly 3 percent more than was in the same period in 1995 . 
total exports in calendar year 1995 dropped by nearly 20 per cent to 538,400 bags . 
Costa Rica - According to the Costa Rica Coffee Institute ( ICAFE ) coffee production in 1996 / 97 ( October / September ) is likely to fall to 2.3 million bags , down from 2.6 million bags produced in 1995 / 96 and 2.5 million bags produced in 1994 / 95 . 
these figures are in line with the figures in our latest world balance estimate . 
the decline in production was ascribed to cyclical factors and damage from Hurricane Cesar that ravaged crop areas in the autumn . 
Brazil - Brazil &apos;s 1997 / 98 ( May / April ) coffee crop will likely weigh-in at around 18.5 to 19.5 million 60-kg bags , down from a 1996 / 97 crop of 26 million bags , an official at the Industry and Commerce Ministry said . 
however , he pointed out that this is not an official estimate . 
for the key growing region of Minas Gerais , the government is using an estimate issued late last month by the State Agricultural Federation ( FAEMG ) of 8.3 million bags . 
in Parana authorities are expecting a harvest of around 1.75 million bags , in Sao Paulo state production should be in the region of 2.2 million bags , while in Esperito Santo the harvest is expected at around 3.7 million bags . 
estimating Brazil &apos;s crop this season is much more difficult than in previous years , due to irregular flowerings .
