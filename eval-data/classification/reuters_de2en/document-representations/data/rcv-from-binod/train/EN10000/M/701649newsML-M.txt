Hungarian overnight rates edged up in tight liquidity on Wednesday to close at 20.50 percent compared with 20.25 percent on Tuesday , traders said . 
&quot; Large amounts are probably tied up in the central bank &apos;s one-week reverse repo faciltiy , &quot; said Sandor Szatmari of Creditanstalt ( corrects bank from Commerzbank ) . 
he added that the increase in the overnight rate remained modest due to the fact that at the beginning of the banks &apos; two-week reserve period market participants were in no hurry to top up their reserves . 
Szatmari also said significant amounts would probably flow back from the one-week reverse repo on Thursday or Friday preventing a further rise . 
&quot; I expect the rates to hover between 20.125 and 20.375 percent ( in the coming days ) , &quot; he said .
