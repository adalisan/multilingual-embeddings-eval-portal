the Polish and Czech agriculture ministers agreed on Monday to coordinate farming policies in their efforts to win membership of the European Union . 
&quot; There can be no question of competing in these efforts . 
we will cooperate , coordinate our actions and present common standpoints to Brussels , &quot; Poland &apos;s Jaroslaw Kalinowski said after meeting his Czech counterpart Josef Lux . 
&quot; We should focus our attention on preparations for EU membership negotiations and we should not do it separately , &quot; Lux added . 
the ministers signed two agreements on mutual recognition of agriculture products &apos; quality certificates , removing a major obstacle in bilateral farm trade . 
but there was no sign of agreement on a timetable for scrapping customs duties for agricultural goods among members of the Central European Free Trade Agreement , whose other members are Hungary , Slovakia and Slovenia . 
LUX also said Prague favoured scrapping all farm duties as of January 1 next year but Kalinowski made clear he preferred a later date . 
&quot; We should not move blindly to liberalisation , &quot; Kalinowski said . 
analysts say Czech agriculture , which employs less than 10 percent of the workforce and where the average farm has 140 hectares , is better prepared for EU accession than that of Poland , which employs 28 percent of the workforce and where farms are very small .
