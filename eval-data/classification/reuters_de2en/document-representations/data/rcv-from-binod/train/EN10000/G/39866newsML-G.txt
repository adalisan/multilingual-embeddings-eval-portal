tropical Storm Hortense threatened to unleash flash floods in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands but failed to whip up hurricane strength as it moved through the Caribbean on Sunday , the National Hurricane Centre said . 
a hurricane warning for the U.S. and British Virgin islands and Puerto Rico was dropped as Hortense failed to strengthen , although tropical storm warnings remained in effect for the islands as of 5 p.m. EDT ( 2100 GMT ) . 
the government of the Dominican Republic was considering issuing a tropical storm watch for parts of the country later on Sunday , the centre said . 
though its winds were below hurricane strength , Hortense posed a serious threat of landslides , mudslides and flash floods as it carried up to 10 inches ( 25 cm ) of rain . 
forecasters said tropical storm strength winds were expected to hit St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands at about midnight local time ( 0400 GMT ) on Sunday . 
Hortense &apos;s maximum sustained winds were 60 mph ( 95 kph ) , having fluctuated during the day , and little change in strength was expected in the next 24 hours . 
it was moving west toward the Dominican Republic and Haiti at 10 mph ( 16 kph ) . 
a hurricane or tropical storm warning indicates the arrival of the respective weather system within 24 hours . 
hurricane and tropical storm watches are posted 36 hours ahead of possible landfall . 
Hortense initially gathered strength in the wake of Hurricane Fran , which hit the U.S. coast on Thursday , wreaking havoc through the Carolinas and Virginia and killing at least 22 people .
