the Australian share market ended lower on Friday , driven down by Thursday &apos;s drop in the Dow Jones index after interest rate fears were reignited on Wall Street in the wake of strong economic data . 
the All Ordinaries index closed 10.6 points down at 2268.7 while September share index futures closed 19 points lower at 2260 and at an 8.7 point discount to the index . 
after the action on Wall Street trade had been fairly predictable , brokers said , adding that the turnover was boosted above the A $ 1 billion mark by the exercise of August series options that expired on Thursday . 
&quot; It &apos;s off its lows but that was mostly on the covering of positions in the afternoon , &quot; said Peter Struk , a dealer at brokerage Reynolds and Co . 
Struk noted the discount of the share price index futures to the underlying All Ordinaries index and said in the current climate that it did not augur well for a market already uncertain about where bonds were heading . 
&quot; futures closed at a discount and some are saying the U.S. will go down again tonight , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The market is very jittery about the outlook for bonds . 
individual features were elusive in a market that traded by numbers after the Wall Street slump but the profit season continued apace . 
transport , logistics and security group Brambles bucked the market trend to close higher after it more than doubled full year net profit to A $ 215.1 million ( US $ 169.9 ) 
mining and smelting group MIM also managed to close higher in a weaker market after turning a prior year loss of A $ 216.1 million into a full year profit of A $ 170.6 million . 
rises just shaded falls , while about 30 percent of stocks traded remained steady .
