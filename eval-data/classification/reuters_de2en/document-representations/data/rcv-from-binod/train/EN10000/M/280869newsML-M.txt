after surging about 37 percent to end 1996 at record levels , Swedish shares are set to post more modest price gains in 1997 , analysts said on Monday . 
five analysts polled by Reuters gave predicted that , on average , the three general indices would rise by some 13 percent next year . 
their estimates varied from 2.5 percent to 30 percent . 
at 1330 GMT , the Stockholm stock exchanges &apos;s general index was up 0.6 percent at a new trading high of 2,359.92 points . 
&quot; Economic trends have already turned in 1996 and there is no reason to worry about interest rates rising during the coming year , &quot; Peter Malmqvist , head analyst at Swedish based brokerage house , Aragon , told Reuters . 
Stockholm &apos;s bourse has enjoyed a record year in 1996 with turnover mounting to over 915 billion crowns ( $ 133 billion ) compared to 665 billion crowns in 1995 . 
&quot; continuing falling interest rates plus good company results have given a strong lift , not least in the trading sector which has jumped 107 percent this year , &quot; the Stockholm bourse said in a statement . 
star performers during the year included fashion retailer Hennes &amp; Mauritz , lock maker Assa Abloy , and oil explorer Forcenergy whose share prices all increased over 120 percent . 
but analysts did not expect this pace of growth to continue in 1997 . 
the more bearish analysts expected interest rates to level or even edge higher in 1997 after the central bank cut its key repo rate to 4.10 from 8.91 percent in 1996 . 
they also saw the upturn in European economies slowing . 
the more bullish analysts said shares would benefit from stronger domestic and European economic trends , low interest rates and low inflation . 
&quot; The bourse will rise 30 percent next year , fuelled by a large capital inflow , &quot; said an analyst at penser brokerage . 
although analysts were divided about the upturn and how sectors would move , some consensus could be found regarding banking shares which most analysts expected to lag . 
&quot; Banking shares are likely to underperform as they &apos;ve risen so much already and will have large costs ahead of EMU ( partly for adjusting computer systems ) , &quot; a Handelsbanken analyst said . 
on the other end of the scale , consumer cyclicals , such as automotive group AB Volvo and tobacco company Swedish Match , should be found , some analysts said . 
&quot; households will get larger disposable income in 1997 and 1998 , so domestic oriented companies &apos; shares should be lifted , &quot; an analyst at brokerage Aros said . 
in a somewhat more long-term view , packaging companies such as beverage can maker PLM and forestry group AssiDoman should benefit from the same trends , he added . 
while most saw Ericsson as a long-term buy , some expected the share to track general indices or only do a little better . 
many saw Astra outperforming indices , fuelled by continued gains for growth companies and a possible share buy-back plan . 
but analysts who calculated for a strong upturn in general economic trends put their bets on the forestry sector and other cyclicals . 
others expected forestry shares to remain sluggish and some analysts were neutral . 
&quot; We recommend a neutral position in bulk cyclicals , steel and forestry , as it is uncertain what direction they will take , &quot; the Aros analyst said . 
as analysts expected a new law allowing companies to buy back their own shares to be passed in 1997 , they saw share buy-back plans , which often boost prices , as a trend of 1997 .
