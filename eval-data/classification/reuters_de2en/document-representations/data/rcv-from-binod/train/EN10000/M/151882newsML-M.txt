changes in the Singapore commodity Exchange ( SICOM ) TSR20 rubber contract should lure new players into a market that has been languishing for weeks in the doldrums , rubber traders said on Tuesday . 
but the impact of the changes , which will be implemented from November 1 this year for the October / December 1997 contract , will not be immediately felt , the traders said . 
the October / December contract will be on fob terms only instead of the current award system . 
&quot; It should attract a lot more players into the market , &quot; the senior trader of a Western commodity house told Reuters . 
&quot; But its impact will be gradual rather than immediate . 
&quot; It &apos;s a good contract in that it will reduce the hassles of trading here . 
but it &apos;s so far forward that volume on the first three months of the new contract will probably be small , &quot; a trader in a Japanese rubber house said . 
but another dealer was skeptical the new terms would spur activity in the rubber market in Singapore , which has been hit by thin trade because of weak buying sentiment . 
&quot; The TSR20 contract is only a small slice of the market . 
we need to attract speculators for all the grades because you need them to inject liquidity into the exchange , &quot; the trader said . 
&quot; Another negative feature is that the contract is only for the October / December contract next year . 
you won &apos;t see much of an impact yet , &quot; another dealer said . 
SICOM has said earlier this month that the current award system will last until the July / September 1997 rubber contracts . 
some of the critical new terms in the TSR20 contract are that it will be denominated in U.S. dollars instead of the previous 
Singapore dollars . 
packaging will use shrink-wrap instead of the former wooden pallets . 
&quot; hedging will be easier as the physical trade is conducted in U.S. dollars , so there will be no need to compare the U.S. dollar and Singapore dollar prices and no foreign exchange risks , &quot; it added . 
it should help cut down on costs , &quot; one trader in a commodity house said . 
method of delivery will be at the warehouse or fob at buyer &apos;s option in Singapore port instead of the previous negotiable award certificates . 
buyers will no longer have to pay a premium for awarding / warehouse cost . 
alternative delivery procedures , barred under the award system , will now be allowed . 
one trader said the change in the packaging to shrink wrap will help since that is now the industry standard . 
fob contracts are more in line with trade flows , &quot; the trader said . 
the new contract should attract fresh players , especially from Indonesia and the United States who had been wary about the award contract in SICOM , a dealer said . 
&quot; They &apos;re frightened about how tough the award system is , &quot; the trader said . 
traders predicted that more players in the market will start unloading their award positions on the July / September 1997 contracts . 
&quot; There probably will be a scramble to get rid of their positions the closer we get to the date , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; People will be looking to liquidate their award positions , &quot; another trader said .
