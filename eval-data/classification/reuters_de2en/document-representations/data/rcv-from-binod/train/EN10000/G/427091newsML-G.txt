the green rates of the Dutch guilder , Spanish peseta , Swedish crown and Austrian schilling will be devalued with effect from Sunday , the European Commission confirmed on Friday . 
the green guilder will devalue to 2.19831 per Ecu , from 2.19514 per Ecu , the green peseta to 165.571 per Ecu from 165.442 , the green Swedish crown to 8.71269 per Ecu from 8.69363 per Ecu and the green Austrian schilling to 13.7529 per Ecu from 13.7526 . 
the UK &apos;s Home grown Cereals Authority ( HGCA ) earlier on Friday forecast the devaluations after the four currencies had negative average real monetary gaps -- between green and market rates -- during the February 27 to March 7 reference period . 
Green rates are used by the European Union ( EU ) to convert Ecu-based prices and aid payments into the currencies of member states in its Common Agricultural Policy .
