Russian security chief Alexander Lebed met Chechen rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev on Tuesday to try to iron out problems with a peace deal signed last month . 
Interfax news agency quoted Lebed , who is President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s personal envoy to Chechnya , as saying his main aim was to clarify plans for a provisional administration in the region that would bring together pro- and anti-Moscow factions . 
Lebed , who held talks with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin at the weekend , also said he planned to &quot; take a look at the turbulence &quot; over the past week between the rebels and Russian generals over a prisoner exchange and troop pullout . 
he began talks with Yandarbiyev at the village of Novye Atagi in the early afternoon . 
rebel Chief-of-Staff Aslan Maskhadov and Tim Guldimann , mediator for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe , were due to join them later . 
Interfax said Lebed would also discuss a criminal code based on Islamic law introduced by the rebel leaders on September 12 . 
on his way to Chechnya , Lebed said he would almost certainly not join Maskhadov at a meeting of the Council of Europe &apos;s parliamentary assembly in Strasbourg on September 23 because the code did not correspond to human rights norms . 
Lebed earlier met the commander of Russian forces in Chechnya , General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov , and other military leaders at the Khankala army base near Grozny , Itar-Tass news agency said . 
it gave no details of the meeting . 
under the peace deal signed by Lebed and Maskhadov on August 31 , Russian troops were supposed to be withdrawn from Chechnya and prisoners handed over by both sides . 
Tikhomirov halted the pullout almost as soon as it started last week , claiming the rebels were breaking the agreement . 
Maskhadov accused the general of brinkmanship . 
Lebed dismissed rumours of an imminent attack on Grozny by forces loyal to pro-Moscow Chechen leader Doku Zavgayev but told Interfax that such talk showed the urgency of bringing the factions together in a coalition to avoid the mainly Moslem region collapsing into Afghan-style chaos . 
Zavgayev himself , however , told Itar-Tass news agency in Moscow it was too early to talk about a coalition , repeating his complaint that Russia had yet to properly define the new administration &apos;s tasks . 
but an official of a largely pro-separatist assembly of Chechen political movements told TASS his body had already set up a 20-member coalition cabinet . 
Lebed said he would also discuss setting up a &quot; joint commission &quot; in the near future , whose job would be to administer federal funds to rebuild Chechnya after nearly two years of war . 
the Russian military said a soldier had died overnight in one of three attacks on Russian positions in the region , but the night was otherwise calm . 
an unnamed military official told Interfax the rebels were violating the peace deal by digging in in Grozny and training new recruits .
