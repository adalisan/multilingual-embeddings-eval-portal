Japan &apos;s merchandise trade surplus is expected to fall in March from a year earlier , but economists say it will be the last drop before it embarks on a series of sharp rises . 
economists at nine banks and research institutes surveyed by Reuters on Monday predicted a fall in the surplus ranging from two percent to 17 percent . 
in value terms , the forecasts ranged from a 929 billion yen ( $ 7.37 billion ) to 1.10 trillion yen ( $ 8.7 billion ) surplus , compared with a 1.12 trillion yen ( $ 8.8 billion ) surplus the previous year . 
the March surplus was expected to slip partly due to a healthy surplus in the same period the year before and partly because of higher imports feeding a manufacturing rush ahead of a rise in the sales tax to five percent from three percent on April 1 . 
but economists added it was likely be the last drop for several months . 
&quot; Everybody agrees that it is rising , it is just a question of how fast , &quot; said Richard Jerram at ING Barings . 
he said that the surplus in seasonally adjusted month-on-month terms had bottomed out in April last year . 
a Reuters quarterly poll of forecasts for Japan &apos;s trade balance showed the surplus is expected to expand to 10.5 trillion yen ( $ 83.3 billion ) this fiscal year , compared with an expected surplus of around 6.6 trillion yen ( $ 52.3 billion ) in fiscal 1996 / 97 . 
economists said that despite a recent barrage of comments from U.S. policymakers , an increase in trade tension in the short term was unlikely . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think the administration is going to do anything about it while the U.S. economy is going so well , &quot; said Matthew Poggi , an economist at Lehman Brothers . 
further pressure was unlikely given that economic growth was strong and a strong dollar worked to keep inflation low by keeping import prices down , economists said . 
while some U.S exporters had already complained about lost competitiveness as a result of the yen weakening against the dollar , Washington would not move until there was some slowing in the economy , they said .
