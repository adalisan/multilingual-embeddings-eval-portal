German Bunds and futures were slightly firmer in early dealings on Friday , underpinned by leaks on Thursday that today &apos;s German jobless data would show ongoing high unemployment . 
DTB September Bund futures were up three basis points at 100.53 points , while the 10-year benchmark Bund due July 2007 was at 101.27 percent for a yield of 5.82 percent . 
&quot; Friday should be called Employment Friday this week , &quot; Deutsche Morgan Grenfell futures &amp; Options said in a commentary , noting the release at 0855 GMT of German data . 
the market on Thursday factored in the German data after official sources said the unadjusted jobless total fell 91,000 to 4.256 million , less than economists had been expecting . 
&quot; The market is spending much more of its time worrying about the U.S. data since the German data has already been in the market , &quot; said one trader . 
on a technical basis , traders looked for September Bunds to find support at 100.44 , . 
100.18 before 100.00 , while resistance was evident at 100.70 and 100.93 .
