China on Monday denied a U.S. newspaper report linking it to the construction of a missile plant in Pakistan . 
asked to comment on a Washington Post report that China had supplied blueprints and equipment for the plant , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said : &quot; The U.S. newspaper report is entirely groundless . 
the spokeswoman had no further comment . 
the Washington Post reported on Sunday that U.S. intelligence officials had concluded that Pakistan was secretly building a medium-range missile factory in a suburb of the northern city of Rawalpindi , near Islamabad . 
the partially completed plant was expected to be capable of producing most of the major components of a missile modelled on the Chinese designed M-11 in a year or two , the newspaper said . 
the United States has twice imposed limited economic sanctions against China for selling M-11 missile launchers and finished missile components to Pakistan , but withdrew the curbs after Beijing promised to stop such deliveries .
