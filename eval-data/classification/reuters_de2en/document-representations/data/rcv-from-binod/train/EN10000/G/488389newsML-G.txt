most Germans do not believe Chancellor Helmut Kohl should stand for election again next year , according to a poll taken just after he announced he would seek another term and released on Friday . 
according to the survey , carried out on Thursday by the Infratest group for WDR regional television , 53 percent of respondents said Kohl should not stand again , 34 percent said he should and 13 percent were indifferent or did not respond . 
Kohl , 67 , made the announcement in a television interview , ending months of speculation that , after over 14 years in charge , he might not have the appetite to tackle Germany &apos;s mounting economic and social problems in a record fifth term . 
forty percent of respondents said they thought Kohl &apos;s candidacy would tend to harm the prospects of his Christian Democrats ( CDU ) in the general election , due in late 1998 , while 37 percent said it would boost the CDU &apos;s performance . 
asked who they thought was the best person to tackle Germany &apos;s current problems , just 25 percent of the 1,000 people polled named Kohl . 
thirty-one percent came out in favour of Lower Saxony state premier Gerhard Schroeder of the opposition Social Democrats ( SPD ) and 16 percent favoured SPD party chairman Oskar Lafontaine . 
the SPD has yet to name its candidate for the chancellery but is likely to face a choice between the left-leaning Lafontaine and the more business-friendly Schroeder . 
Schroeder regularly rates in polls as the man with the best chance of unseating Kohl but is treated with suspicion by SPD members for frequently ignoring the party line , for instance by suggesting European monetary union could be postponed . 
asked who the SPD should nominate , 59 percent of respondents named Schroeder and 23 percent Lafontaine . 
the Infratest survey confirmed a growing opinion poll lead in recent weeks for a combination of SPD and environmentalist Greens over Kohl &apos;s coalition of CDU and liberal Free Democrats . 
there was little sign that Kohl &apos;s candidacy had boosted the CDU &apos;s rating , which was up just one point from an Infratest poll taken on March 13 .
