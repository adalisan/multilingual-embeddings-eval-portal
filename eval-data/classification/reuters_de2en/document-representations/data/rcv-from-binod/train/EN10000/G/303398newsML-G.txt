Bangladesh &apos;s former president Hossain Mohammad Ershad said his Jatiya Party would support the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina until the next general elections in 2001 . 
&quot; Our support will remain intact for the government through its full term of five years . 
we believe that supporting a good government means doing good for the people , &quot; he said . 
Ershad was speaking to reporters on Sunday night after saying prayers at the tombs of two Moslem saints in Sylhet town in the country &apos;s tea-growing northeastern district . 
it was his first visit outside Dhaka after being released from jail on Thursday . 
Ershad said : &quot; We are not giving unconditional support to Hasina . 
we will certainly criticise her for doing anything bad for the people . 
Ershad &apos;s party supported Hasina &apos;s Awami League in forming a government following a general election last June . 
he fought the election from jail and was elected a member of parliament . 
Begum Khaleda Zia , chief of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) , alleged that Ershad &apos;s release after six years in prison was the result of a &quot; successful conspiracy &quot; between Ershad &apos;s party and the Awami League . 
Ershad rejected the allegation as an &quot; outburst of ( Khaleda &apos;s ) dismal political prospects . 
Ershad walked out of jail a day after he was granted bail by the Supreme Court on the last of a series of corruption charges against him . 
Ershad , a retired army general who seized power in a 1982 bloodless coup , had been in jail since he was toppled in a popular uprising in December 1990 . 
&quot; Every political party wants to run the country . 
we have long experience in running the country , &quot; Ershad said on Sunday . 
&quot; God and people willing , we hope to govern again , &quot; he said . 
I don &apos;t think the opposition now has any strong issue at hand to press for that , &quot; Ershad added .
