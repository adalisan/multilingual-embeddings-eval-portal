the Kenyan shilling maintained its bullish sentiment on the dollar as inflows from exporters sales continued streaming into the market , dealers said . 
they said many players were stuck with dollars from Monday &apos;s and Tuesday &apos;s tea and coffee auctions , because they could not get avenues to offload their long dollar positions . 
the Central Bank of Kenya posted a mean shilling average of 55.42 against the dollar from 55.45 on Tuesday , while on the pound , it was posted at 92.75 from 92.66 . 
&quot; marginal trading in the interbank market inadvertently helped push the dollar down , &quot; one commercial dealer said . 
&quot; Many dollars are also coming in from overseas investors looking to invest in Kenyan treasury bills , &quot; another said . 
he said the interest rate differentials between commercial bank dollar-deposits and the 91-day category of treasury bills -- about 6.5 percent , made investment in Kenya a worthwhile venture for a foreigner . 
some dealers expected demand from oil companies , but it was not forthcoming . 
&quot; Unless , the central bank comes in , we expect the shilling to appreciate further . 
in any case , even the demand from the &apos; oil boys &apos; cannot change the direction of the shilling at this point , &quot; one dealer said . 
they said the central bank appeared comfortable with the 55.40 level , and predicted that this would be the next resistance level for the shilling . 
the money market was very liquid due to treasury bill maturities on Monday . 
rates were quoted below 10 percent levels from 15-20 percent levels on Tuesday .
