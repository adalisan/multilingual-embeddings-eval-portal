SIMEX Euroyen futures ended sharply higher on Wednesday after the release of the Bank of Japan &apos;s Tankan report which showed that corporate sentiment worsened in August . 
dealers said trading was volatile with hectic buying seen across the board in December , March and June contracts . 
&quot; The market was very firm because of the gloomy report . 
there was some profit-taking but the market will remain bullish as the report just confirms that there will be no change in monetary policy , &quot; said a Japanese broker . 
he said market participants also bought the March contracts as they expect no rate hikes until the end of the current fiscal year . 
&quot; But I think the buying in June contracts was an over-reaction - it almost reached the 99.00 level . 
we are recommending our clients to buy the front months and sell the back months , &quot; he added . 
December Euroyen touched a high of 99.33 before profit taking brought it back to end to 99.30 against its CME close of 99.14 . 
volume was 13,730 contracts . 
March ended at 99.13 against its CME close of 98.90 on hectic trading of 44,365 
contracts . 
Japanese government bond futures also ended higher with September contracts settling at 121.82 against its open at 120.50 . 
Eurodollars firmed on the back of back of higher U.S. Treasury bond prices . 
dealers said trading was still rangebound with December contracts expected to stay between 94.05 and 94.15 until the release of the July unemployment report next week . 
volume was 10,045 contracts .
