Dutch shares closed slightly weaker on Monday after an early spurt on the back of Wall Street &apos;s record close evaporated as investors quickly showed themselves nervous in the new record territory , dealers said . 
&quot; There was just no follow-through buying . 
which ever way you look at it -- this market is getting very expensive , &quot; one said . 
the AEX of blue chip stocks rose strongly early on , hitting a new all-time high of 597.80 , before slipping back to trade around a 595 points for most of the afternoon . 
a weaker start on Wall Street on Monday further undermined sentiment and a late slip meant the index closed down 1.90 points at 592.43 . 
dealers said profit-taking increased as the market neared 600 points but some still expected the level to be reached within the next few trading sessions . 
but they were divided ovedr whether it could hang onto such a level . 
some said further gains would be a healthy sign . 
&quot; I &apos;d rather stay out of the market as it is now and then come back in if we got to 610 , &quot; one dealer said . 
but technical signals were still positive and chart analysts were setting initial targets at between 625 and 630 points , with initial resistance expected around 598 points . 
the index won support through the day from heavyweight Royal Dutch where the oil price surge and firmer dollar have boosted the stock recently . 
but some dealers were sceptical that such strong gains were justified ahead of the group &apos;s third quarter earnings figures due at the end of the month . 
&quot; Those figures are going to have to be very , very good , &quot; one dealer said . 
Royal Dutch put on 2.80 guilders to close at 291.10 , a new year high and building on the 3.10 guilder rise on Friday . 
but the other index heavyweight Philips slipped on continued investor jitters after the profit warning issued last week . 
analysts are braced for a huge restructuring charge at the electronics giant , when it reports its third quarter results on Thursday . 
some analysts believe the charge may be as high as one billion guilders . 
the shares closed down 1.50 guilders at 59.30 . 
another index underperformer was retailer Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer ( KBB ) , which announced earlier in the day it had bought 500,000 of its own shares from a placement by Vendex International . 
Vendex sold its 36 percent stake in KBB , raising a 130 million guilder book profit . 
KBB closed down 1.80 guilders at 118.70 and Vendex ended down 0.70 at 71.40 guilders .
