a light day of trading was expected in U.S. government securities on Friday , with no economic data releases to give players direction . 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will speak on regulatory matters and Fed Vice Chairwoman Alice Rivlin will moderate a panel at the Atlanta Fed &apos;s conference . 
some market participants expressed concern that U.S. dollar weakening would carry overnight from Thursday and depress treasuries prices in Tokyo . 
&quot; You could make a case that we &apos;re going to see a quiet session Friday as there &apos;s nothing scheduled and the market still has the upcoming challenge of Chairman Greenspan &apos;s Humphrey-Hawkings testimony to get through . 
Wednesday is the first day and the first days are usually the ones that generate the most static , &quot; said Kevin Flanagan , money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc . 
supply also becomes a concern next week with two- and five-year note auctions and regular weekly bills , Flanagan said , another reason trading activity was likely to be lightly traded in thin ranges on Friday . 
Flanagan noted that Greenspan was scheduled to speak on bank regulatory topics and few expected any comments on the economy . 
nevertheless , Greenspan &apos;s remarks would be closely monitored as &quot; he just might provide the catalyst the market needs to get going one way or the other , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The market may be a little bit defensive after a really good run . 
we &apos;ve rallied about 40 basis points since the end of January , &quot; said Stuart Hoffman , senior economist at PNC Financial Corp. 
bond market yields remained at the lower end of the recent trading range , so yields may be going higher , he said . 
but Elliott Platt , director of economic research at Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. , wasn &apos;t one of them . 
&quot; That &apos;s a misperception . 
any foreign selling wouldn &apos;t affect the market for more than a couple of hours , &quot; Platt said . 
instead , the market was keyed on Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s Humphrey-Hawkings testimony before Congress February 26 and 27 and the National Association of Purchasing Management and employment reports the week following , Platt said . 
&quot; The economic data for Janaury and February seem to have a little bit of a stronger feel to them , particularly on the buy side of the economy , &quot; Hoffman said . 
&quot; Gold has bounced back with some of the other basic industrial commodities . 
Hoffman said the dollar seemed to be settling instead of gaining more strength . 
&quot; When the market couldn &apos;t rally in the face of Wednesday &apos;s very good consumer price report , it had to tell you that the market is really just tired at this point , Hoffman said . 
CPI rose only 0.1 percent in both the overall and core rates and followed a fall in producer prices the prior week . 
&quot; We broke through some crucial levels Thursday and some people had set up shorts and may not want to hold them over the weekend , &quot; said Jerry Zukowski , economist at PaineWebber Inc . &quot; But it &apos;s hard to see whether the lower levels would be validated as futures were already closed Thursday . 
&quot; But there is no reason to push the market in one direction or the other , &quot; Zukowski said .
