COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures were called to open higher Friday in line with further gains in the bullion market overnight as the dollar slid to a six-week low against the yen and four-week low against the mark . 
part of the reason for the fall in gold in the past year to a four-year low had been the steady rise in the dollar , making gold more expensive in many currencies , but this may now be reversed , analysts said . 
COMEX June gold was called up $ 0.50 to $ 1.00 from the previous close of $ 344.80 an ounce . 
spot gold was quoted at $ 344.80 / $ 345.30 early compared to the London morning fix of $ 343.75 -- the highest in three weeks . 
in New York Thursday , spot gold ended quoted at $ 343.50 / $ 344.00 . 
NYMEX July platinum and June palladium were called up $ 0.50 to $ 1.00 from their prior closes of $ 379.50 and 157.90 , respectively . 
in London today , palladium was fixed at its highest in in nearly two years at $ 162.50 .
