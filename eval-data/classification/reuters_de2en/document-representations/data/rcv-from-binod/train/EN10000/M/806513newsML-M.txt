Britain &apos;s leading share index trimmed its losses in late trading on Monday as investors took heart from an early rise on Wall Street and buyers emerged after four days of declines . 
fears of an aftershock following Friday &apos;s 22 billion pound ( $ 35.4 billion ) share writeoff initially proved overblown , market sources said , although the next big move hinged on the trend on Wall Street . 
the Dow industrials traded 22.06 points higher at 7,716.72 . 
both markets recorded their biggest one-day drop since 1987 on Friday and the FTSE 100 posted its largest percentage loss since 1992 . 
&quot; My belief is that this is an aberration and if institutional investors take advantage of the correction to get back in , both U.S. and domestic investors , we may see a strong end to the week , &quot; said Savvas Savouri , a strategist at Credit Lyonnais Laing . 
many strategists and traders said the 2.5 percent FTSE selloff on Friday was more a correction to this year &apos;s record run rather than the start of a bear market . 
expectations for UK interest rates to stay on hold for the time being , after four hikes in four months , and high cash levels among institutions were prime reasons . 
yet another sharp drop in the Dow industrials or fears of monetary tightening in the U.S. or continental Europe , would rattle London investors , and some warned that as much as a 10 percent correction would ensue . 
London &apos;s blue-chip index had gained 24 percent this year to its all-time best of 5,095.3 hit on August 7 . 
since then , it has lost 6.2 percent and Friday &apos;s drop was the largest percentage fall in five years . 
the weekend may also have proved more soothing than worrying , sources said , as investors had a couple of extra days to ponder the sell-off and think about the market &apos;s fundamentals . 
&quot; We &apos;ve got a 4,800 year-end target and we don &apos;t expect it to move a lot from here , &quot; said Ian Scott , UK equity strategist at Lehman Brothers . 
a sharp recovery in the broader market in the last two weeks -- the second-line FTSE 250 actually ended higher on Friday-- also alleviated fears of a full-blown bear market , market sources said . 
the FTSE 250 was down 0.79 percent or 37.3 points at 4,660.9 after hitting a five-month high of 4,712.9 Friday . 
sterling &apos;s retreat against the German mark after the Bank of England signalled early this month that interest rates may stay on hold , has boosted the fortunes of the second-tier industrial companies with a large percentage of overseas earnings . 
those companies &apos; profits were hit by sterling &apos;s rise as their earnings dwindle when converted from the local currency . 
&quot; I think we have seen the worse for the day and I don &apos;t think we are in a bear phase , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; This is a good healthy correction after the British and global stock markets extended themselves . 
but Richard Jeffrey , head of research at Charterhouse Tilney , said the FTSE 100 could eventually fall another 400 to 500 points , or about 10 percent . 
&quot; As far as London is concerned , yes , it is New York , and the worry about ( UK ) interest rates having to rise sharply for the rest of the year , &quot; he said .
