Britain &apos;s Royal Mail has apologised to a sick , elderly couple who were shocked and upset when a postman delivered their mail in a hearse . 
Christine Thornton , 65 , and her 72-year-old husband Gordon , suffer from a variety of illnesses and could hardly believe their eyes when a letter from their cardiovascular surgeon arrived in the black funeral vehicle . 
&quot; I was awfully upset -- it was the last thing I wanted to see , &quot; said Thornton , from Newton Aycliffe in northern England . 
&quot; It made me really poorly , I couldn &apos;t get it out of my mind and didn &apos;t sleep all night . 
a spokesman for the Royal Mail apologised for any distress caused to the couple . 
he said it had been an exceptionally busy day and the local postman , who owns the hearse , was working overtime and delivered the post in his own vehicle .
