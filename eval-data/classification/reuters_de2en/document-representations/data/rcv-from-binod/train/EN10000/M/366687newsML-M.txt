the Belgrade Stock Exchange ( BSE ) posted a strong 61.2 percent rise in its turnover during the week ending February 7 , boosted by trade in shares renewed after almost one year , the bourse said on Monday . 
total BSE turnover rose to 54.323 million dinars ( $ 9.917 million ) with shares accounting for 25.5 million dinars . 
meeting a new set of rules set by the Yugoslav Securities Commission ( YSC ) last November , Kulska banka , AIK banka and Panonska banka listed and began selling their stock on the BSE late last week . 
in an attempt to speed up development of the local financial market , YSC said it would qualify a share issue as successful only if part of the issue is listed and sold on the bourse . 
AIK banka sold 20.5 million dinars and Kulska banka five million dinars in ordinary shares . 
Panonska listed four million dinars worth of its stock , but found no buyers , the BSE said . 
&quot; Those are small-to-medium size healthy banks , more aggressive and prepared to adjust to the market than the big ones , &quot; Stimac said . 
Kulska banka and AIK banka stock was sold to big investors , and Panonska will certainly find a buyer by the end of this week , he added . 
but analysts did not expect secondary trade in shares to develop any time soon . 
&quot; We operate in a highly illiquid market , with insignificant amounts of free funds available for such an activity , &quot; said an analyst who asked not to be named . 
the analyst insisted shares sold on the BSE last week were all part of prearranged deals and did not reflect real interest for such an investment . 
traders remained cautious about shares returning to the BSE insisting the ongoing political crisis over local election fraud could not be treated as a stable investment climate . 
they also cited difficulties in obtaining prospectuses as another obstacle to larger investor interest . 
&quot; But this is only the beginning and like any first-born child , it must be accompanied by some difficulties , &quot; a trader said . 
the BSE , basically trading in financial instruments and commodities , has not traded equities since early 1996 . 
the only two shares listed and traded in 1995 were those of Investbanka and Sintelon . 
both were de-listed in 1996 after several months of non-trading .
