a leading Malaysian politician was committed on Tuesday to stand trial in Australia on charges he tried to take A $ 1.26 million ( US $ 930,000 ) in cash out of the country without declaring it . 
a lawyer for former chief minister of the Malaysian state of Selangor , Muhammad Muhammad Taib , told the Brisbane magistrates court that he would plead not guilty . 
the Brisbane court had earlier heard how Muhammad Taib had been caught with the money in his hand luggage as he checked in for a flight from Brisbane to New Zealand in December , 1996 . 
Muhammad Taib &apos;s lawyer , Terry O &apos;Gorman , cross-examined police and immigration officials , making them acknowledge that the Malaysian had not been asked to declare what money he had as he left the country . 
but at the end of the first day of what was expected to be a two-day committal hearing , magistrate William McKay ruled that a trial should stand ahead . 
&quot; Having heard the evidence today I am satisfied the evidence aqainst you is sufficient for you to stand trial , &quot; McKay told Muhammad Taib . 
Muhammad Taib was released on bail until his trial on October 25 . 
the two charges Muhammad Taib faces carry maximum penalties of a A $ 10,000 fine and / or five years &apos; jail . 
Muhammad Taib , 51 , resigned his Selangor post in April because of the charges but remained a vice-president of Malaysia &apos;s ruling United Malays National Organisation ( UMNO ) . 
the court heard that the huge sum of cash came to light after Muhammad Taib was told at Brisbane Airport last December that his bag was too big to go with him as cabin baggage , O &apos;Gorman told the court . 
&quot; As the bag was going through the X-ray conveyor , one of the security officers said it was too big and too heavy and would have to go in the luggage compartment , and Mr Taib said &apos; well if this luggage has got to go into the luggage compartment I &apos;ve got a lot of valuables I want to get out &apos; , &quot; O &apos;Gorman said . 
o &apos;Gorman said the cash , in various currencies , was to buy Muhammad &apos;s Taib &apos;s three brothers three blocks of land adjoining a block he bought earlier at Sovereign Island on Queensland &apos;s Gold Coast . 
under questioning from O &apos;Gorman , Australian Federal Police agent Glyn Lewis agreed that Muhammad Taib had claimed most of the money belonged to his three brothers . 
Lewis also agreed that Muhammad Taib had declared on arrival in Australia on December 16 last year that he was carrying more than the allowable A $ 5,000 -- although he said he was carrying only the equivalent of less than A $ 10,000 in Malaysian ringgit . 
Lewis also agreed that when Muhammad Taib left Australia on December 22 , he was not asked to declare if he was carrying more than A $ 5,000 . 
in a police interview at Brisbane airport , read out at Tuesday &apos;s hearing , Muhammad Taib said he wanted to invest in Australia even though many of his friends had got cold feet because of comments by race row politician Pauline Hanson , a Queensland MP .
