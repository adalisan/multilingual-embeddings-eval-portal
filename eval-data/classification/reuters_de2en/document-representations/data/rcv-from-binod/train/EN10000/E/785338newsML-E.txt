Ireland &apos;s economy is still running full steam ahead with no sign of a slowdown , June domestic credit data confirmed on Thursday . 
Central bank monthly statistics showed Ireland &apos;s adjusted annual private sector credit growth at 20.6 percent at end-June versus 18.9 percent in May against analysts &apos; forecasts of around 19 to 20 percent . 
&quot; It confirms the economy is growing more strongly than people think and does not indicate any sign of slowing down , &quot; Riada economist Dan McLaughlin told Reuters . 
&quot; We are going for 7.0 percent GNP growth this year - perhaps that is too low . 
the data followed surprisingly low inflation figures for July released earlier and a much higher-than-expected Exchequer surplus for July , released on Tuesday . 
&quot; On the surface we have a golden scenario with very strong growth but with no inflation to speak of , &quot; McLaughlin said . 
figures released earlier on Thursday showed consumer prices fell 0.1 percent on the month , well below most market forecasts for a 0.2 to 0.3 percent rise . 
analysts attributed the drop to the impact of summer sales and other seasonal factors on clothing and footwear prices , which fell 6.5 percent on the month , and durable household good prices , which were down 0.5 percent . 
Ireland &apos;s Exchequer surprised financial markets on Tuesday by announcing a much stronger-than-expected Exchequer surplus at end-July of 929 million Irish pounds ( $ 1.3 billion ) against forecasts of between 570 to 600 million punts surplus . 
Tuesday &apos;s data showed the Exchequer benefiting from strong tax revenue with total tax receipts up at 8.42 billion Irish pounds at end-July compared with 7.29 billion pounds at end-July 1996 . 
&quot; The economy is clearly motoring at a very strong pace confirmed by the tax and credit data , &quot; McLaughlin said . 
economists agreed that while June &apos;s high credit growth number would not please the inflation-conscious central bank , Ireland &apos;s exchange rate was probably more relevant to inflation levels . 
the Irish pound has dropped 10 percent against sterling since the start of the year and economists warned that while its inflationary impact was slow to come through it should begin to appear in the second half of the year . 
AIB &apos;s economist Oliver Mangan said many companies bought the currency forward at the beginning of the year so it could be September or October before the impact of the drop became apparent .
