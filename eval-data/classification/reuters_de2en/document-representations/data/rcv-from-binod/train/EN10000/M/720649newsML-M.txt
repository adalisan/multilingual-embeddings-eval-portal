Dutch money rates held largely steady in low-volume trade on Thursday as the holiday season took hold . 
overnight guilders edged up a touch ahead of a new special advances pact due to be announced at 1400 GMT today , quoting at three percent bid from 2.98 percent on Wednesday . 
traders reported little activity in longer-dated money , where prices have trodden water for close on a week now . 
a one-basis point increase in the price of August and September Dutch Treasury certificates to 3.08 percent and 3.10 percent respectively failed to tempt the market . 
&quot; I &apos;ve seen no primary or secondary dealing in DTCs today , &quot; one trader said . 
the guilder was quoting at 112.60 per 100 marks around 1230 GMT versus 112.571 on Wednesday . 
dealers said they expected the new special advances pact to be set at an unchanged rate of 2.90 percent .
