an Indian court on Friday ruled that former prime minister P.V. 
Narasimha Rao did not have to appear at a court hearing next week in a criminal forgery case , United News of India ( Uni ) said . 
Rao &apos;s lawyers had argued that police could not protect against the threat of attack by extremists if Rao appeared at a crowded local court , and that the former prime minister could be represented by counsel at the October 14 hearing . 
the news agency did not say whether the ruling exempting Rao from having to appear in court would apply to any hearings in the case held after October 14 . 
the order by chief metropolitan magistrate Prem Kumar was the second small victory for Rao on Friday . 
earlier , the Supreme Court ordered the hearing into the seven-year-old forgery case , as well as a hearing into a separate criminal cheating case also involving Rao , shifted from a crowded court to a more secure location . 
Rao &apos;s lawyers have sought to prevent their client from appearing in court , in part because of the perceived security threat but also because of the potential damage it could do to the politician &apos;s career .
