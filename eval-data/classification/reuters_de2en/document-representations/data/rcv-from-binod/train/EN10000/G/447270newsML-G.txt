the Nation of Islam said Monday it aimed to attract 5,000 men to a march on April 14 in a Philadelphia neighbourhood beset by racial tension since a group of whites beat a black woman and her son in February . 
&quot; We intend this ( as ) a peaceful demonstration ... We want to end violence and injury to all of the residents of that community , both black and white , &quot; Rodney Muhammad , Philadelphia leader of the Nation of Islam , told a city hall news conference . 
an African-American woman , Annette Williams , 34 , and her son and nephew were beaten on Feb . 22 by a group of 20 to 50 white men leaving a party in the Grays ferry neighbourhood of Philadelphia . 
the street on which the beatings took place had been all white until recent years when several black families moved in . 
two men have been arrested in the beatings . 
tensions were heightened further last week when the white teenage son of a Philadelphia policeman was shot and killed by a black gunman during a robbery in the area and there were unconfirmed reports of attacks on two other blacks in the neighbourhood . 
at meeting in the neighbourhood Sunday , religious and civil-rights leaders called for calm and a dialogue to enhance &quot; racial healing .
