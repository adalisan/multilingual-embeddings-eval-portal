heavy gains to Slovak drug maker Slovakofarma on Monday pushed the Bratislava Stock Exchange &apos;s ( BSE ) SAX index slightly up , but volume remained very thin . 
Slovakofarma closed up 448 crowns at 4,720 , with the average price -- used for calculating the index -- jumping 10.5 percent . 
but brokers said only six Slovakofarma shares were traded during Monday &apos;s continuous session - too little to show any firm longer term trend . 
&quot; The volume was too small ... but it may have been that somebody is trying to pull the price up with small volumes to prepare a better price for selling some more shares , &quot; said one Bratislava-based broker . 
meanwhile , trading with most of the leading shares remained lacklustre on Monday as only 422 shares changed hands on the BSE main listed market , brokers said . 
steel maker VSZ , which has been considered the BSE &apos;s most liquid share over the past few months , closed up five crowns at 650 , trading 416 shares . 
the most-heavily weighted issue on the 16-share SAX , oil refiner Slovnaft , did not trade at all on Monday . 
brokers have said price movements , at present , often fail to reflect shares &apos; fundamentals due to sluggish trading activity and low volumes . 
overall volume fell to 52,647 shares from 2,053,249 stocks traded on Friday , while turnover decreased to 41.60 million crowns from 1.597 billion on Friday . 
both overall volume and turnover consisted mainly in direct trades .
