investigators at the Army &apos;s chemical weapons incinerator near Tooele , Utah , searched on Monday for the source of a small nerve gas leak that halted weapons destruction over the weekend , officials said . 
the facility , 50 miles ( 80 km ) southwest of Salt Lake City , will remain closed until the problem is found and corrected , Army spokesman Jeff Lindblad said . 
a special Army evaluation team from Aberdeen proving Ground in Maryland will arrive at Tooele on Monday and begin investigating on Tuesday , Lindblad said . 
workers detected the leak on Saturday afternoon during a routine check of charcoal air filters attached to an entryway . 
Lindblad did not have an exact measurement of the nerve gas leak , but said it was only trace amounts -- small enough for a worker to be safe in the area without a mask . 
&quot; You &apos;re talking about molecules , &quot; he said . 
the leak occurred during the process of draining the agent from the rockets and cutting them up for incineration . 
&quot; anytime you cut a rocket , you &apos;re going to have a little bit of vapor come out , &quot; Lindblad said , adding that Army planners had anticipated such a leak would occur during the three- to four-month testing period . 
he said the Army experienced similar problems at its pilot incinerator on Johnston atoll in the Pacific Ocean and consequently installed the detection filters at Tooele . 
lawyers for environmentalists who unsuccessfully opposed the Tooele incinerator in federal court had argued the Army &apos;s plans did not sufficiently correct the problems at Johnston atoll . 
the Army and its subcontractor , e.g. &amp; G. Inc . &apos; s ( EGG.N ) e.g. &amp; G. 
Defense Materials Inc . , began trial burns of nerve gas-filled M-55 rockets on Thursday and had incinerated 205 rockets before Saturday &apos;s shutdown . 
about 44 percent of the nation &apos;s chemical weapons stockpile is housed at Tooele . 
smaller caches of chemical weapons are stored at seven other locations around the country , and the Army plans similar incinerators at each . 
Congress has mandated all chemical weapons incineration be completed by the year 2004 .
