OLOs had room to rise further after Tuesday &apos;s welcome rash of weaker-than-expected U.S. data , dealers said , but there could be jitters ahead with more figures due when Belgium is closed for a holiday on Thursday . 
Tuesday &apos;s U.S. data showed a lower-than-expected rise in the first quarter Employment Cost Index and a 3.0 percent fall in March durable goods orders , dampening any inflation worries and making another U.S rate rise look less likely . 
&quot; The market was short and negative in the U.S. ( before the figures ) , &quot; said one dealer . 
in Belgium , activity was mostly concentrated in 10-year paper .
