Albania coach Astrit Hafizi on Friday called on his country &apos;s sports ministry and soccer federation to settle their dispute which has led to the country &apos;s suspension from international soccer and jeopardised their chances of qualifying for the World Cup . 
FIFA , the game &apos;s governing body , suspended Albania indefinitely after the sports ministry ordered the suspension of Albanian Football Association ( AFA ) general secretary Eduard Dervishi and dissolved the executive committee . 
Albania &apos;s state secretary for sports Marjeta Pronjari said Dervishi was banned for having continuously postponed new executive committee elections , breaking the country &apos;s civil law . 
Hafizi told the Albanian news agency ATA : &quot; Their duel should not turn out to be an obstacle for the Albanian sport . 
Albanian sport does not deserve such a privation . 
the ban could lead to the cancellation of Albania &apos;s World Cup group nine qualifying match against Northern Ireland on December 14 . 
Northern Ireland have asked FIFA to tell them by Tuesday if the match in Belfast will go ahead as planned . 
Pronjari said he deeply regretted the suspension and vowed to get Albania reinstated by FIFA . 
but FIFA fully backed AFA , saying it did not recognise the decisions and still considered Dervishi and the dissolved executive as their only official contacts in Albania .
