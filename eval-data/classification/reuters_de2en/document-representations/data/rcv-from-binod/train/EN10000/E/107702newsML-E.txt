finance minister Anthony Ani , just back from a World Bank conference in Washington , said Nigeria expected a big reduction in its foreign debt going by the decision of a committee of top multilateral lending agencies . 
&quot; The committee took a very serious decision whereby highly indebted poor countries of which Nigeria is one will be entitled to 67 percent debt reduction after a three-year period of reforms and we have done 18 months of reform , &quot; Ani said on state television on Wednesday night . 
he said the committee of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) took the decision during the annual general meeting of the Bretton Woods institutions in Washington last week . 
but bankers in Lagos said while the decision to forgive some debts of third world countries was remarkable , Nigeria was unlikely to be a beneficiary . 
&quot; For one our relations with the West are not good enough and secondly our stock of debt is too high , &quot; said one . 
Nigeria &apos;s foreign debt stands at $ 32.585 billion with 67 percent or $ 21.67 billion owed to the Paris Club of government creditors while the rest are to commercial banks . 
annulment of an election in 1993 which would have restored democracy soured relations with powewrful Western nations , a situation that degenerated because of alleged human rights abuses and Nigeria &apos;s slow pace of democratisation . 
the politically-troubled African nation has been in talks with the IMF and the World Bank on its so-called &quot; home grown &quot; medium term economic adjustment programme for which it needs their endorsement to win rescheduling of its debt repayment . 
Nigeria &apos;s last accords with the two expired in 1992 . 
several World Bank missions have visited Nigeria over the last 12 months to assess the programme and Ani said they were happy that stability had been achieved in key macro-economic areas such as exchange and interest rates . 
he said he had successful meetings in Washington with both the president of the World Bank and IMF &apos;s managing director . 
&quot; I am pleased to say that they are very happy with our efforts so far , &quot; he said . 
the finance minister said the fiscal 1997 budget due to be announced by military ruler General Sani Abacha in January would focus on stimulating economic growth . 
another key action would be to merge the exchange rate of Nigerian naira currency with the government &apos;s own rate . 
&quot; The merger must come , there is no doubt about that ... we want to study the situation to know whether to merge downward or upward or in the middle , &quot; he said . 
the free rate has hovered around 80 naira to $ 1 over the past 18 months compared with an official rate of 22 to the dollar used for few government transactions . 
( $ 1 = 80 naira )
