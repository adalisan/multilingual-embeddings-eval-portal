Italy &apos;s debt market closed around the day &apos;s highs with BTP futures storming up after a slow start , boosted by the dollar &apos;s strength sending the lira to a high against the mark under 970 not seen since January . 
&quot; The bond markets just don &apos;t want to come down . 
the dollar &apos;s strength this afternoon allowed the September BTP contract to recover from what looked like a downturn until the afternoon , &quot; one trader said , noting Bund futures were also at day highs . 
the September Liffe BTP contract ended 54 basis points up at 136.78 after a high at 136.79 and low at 136.33 . 
the dollar on Friday touched a near six-year high versus the mark at 1.7703 marks . 
the lira touched 969.60 per mark , its highest since January this year . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see any reason why the futures should ease , &quot; one trader said , adding that in the absence of any bad news on the single European currency front there was every reason to buy Btps . 
&quot; No one wants to risk being left short in this market because they could really get hurt , &quot; another said . 
traders saw very strong support for the BTP at 136.00 . 
on the cash market , the February 2007 BTP gained 40 bps to 102.75 , yielding 6.45 percent , with the 10-year BTP / Bund spread steady at a low 91 basis points . 
&quot; With the Bund so strong it will be difficult to see the spread narrowing below 90 bps . 
the future can rise some more but I think the spread is at its low for the moment , &quot; one trader said . 
but another trader was more optimistic : 
&quot; underlying sentiment is still very positive and in this scenario the spread could narrow to 80 bps by the end of next week with the September BTP at 139.00 , &quot; he said .
