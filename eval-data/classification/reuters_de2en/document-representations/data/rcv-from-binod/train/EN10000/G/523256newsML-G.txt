an officer in the pro-Israeli militia in south Lebanon was killed on Sunday by a car bomb blast , pro-Israeli militia sources said . 
they said the blast occurred when 30-year-old Captain Asaad Nammour of the South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) militia stepped into his car outside his home in Jizzine , a strip of territory officially outside Israel &apos;s south Lebanon occupation zone but under SLA control . 
no group claimed immediate responsibility for the attack . 
Moslem Lebanese and leftist Arab guerrillas regularly attack Israeli troops and their local militia allies in a bid to oust them from the 15-km ( nine miles ) -wide occupation zone .
