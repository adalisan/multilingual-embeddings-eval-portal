the escudo followed the peseta lower against the mark and dealers expected it to extend losses over the session . 
the escudo opened at 101.00 / 03 per mark after closing at 100.95 / 101.00 on Thursday but dealers saw support at 101.10 . 
&quot; Since the peseta is falling the Bank of Portugal will allow some depreciation in the escudo but it won &apos;t accept a rate below 101.10 , &quot; said one dealer .
