Michael Stoute was confident on Saturday that entrepreneur could join the ranks of racing immortals with a convincing win in the Epsom Derby . 
the trainer , fresh from his coronation Cup triumph with globetrotting champion Singspiel , said of entrepreneur : &quot; This is the horse they all have to beat on Guineas form . 
entrepreneur showed blistering speed to land the Newmarket 2,000 Guineas and victory over the unique Epsom switchback would put the stamp of greatness on entrepreneur . 
&quot; entrepreneur has never worked over the full Derby distance but he has galloped and cantered round a left-handed track so I am very hopeful that he will handle Epsom , &quot; Stoute said . 
victory would fulfil a lifetime ambition for former bookmaker Michael Tabor who has been a phenomenally successful owner around the world and already captured a Kentucky Derby with thunder Gulch . 
bookmakers are expecting a 30 million pounds ( $ 48.9 million ) betting bonanza on the world &apos;s most famous horse race -- even if entrepreneur is virtually unbackable for small-time punters at 4-5 . 
they will be looking for good each way value in the 13-horse field who might just surprise entrepreneur and his jockey , big race specialist Michael Kinane . 
the grey Silver Patriarch ( 11-2 ) scored a facile victory in the Lingfield Derby trial over a similar track and overnight rain at Epsom on Friday will have helped his chances . 
French champion trainer Andre Fabre , who has just won his first French Derby with Peintre Celebre , hopes to complete the Epsom double with Cloudings ( 10-1 ) . 
but all the form lines keep coming back to entrepreneur , the class act of the race whose victory will have a bittersweet taste for Stoute . 
for his long-time stable jockey Walter Swinburn has taken a sabbatical from racing to battle weight problems after an horrific fall in Hong Kong . 
&quot; I wanted so much to ride him at Epsom , &quot; Swinburn told the London Evening Standard . 
no one knows that better than me but my body was in trauma , &quot; he said . 
and Swinburn , who as a teenager partnered the mighty Shergar to a breathtaking 10-length win in the 1981 Derby , paid entrepreneur the ultimate compliment . 
&quot; He has far more speed than Shergar who was an outstanding galloper of great quality . 
and don &apos;t believe anyone who tells you a horse as fast as him won &apos;t stay .
