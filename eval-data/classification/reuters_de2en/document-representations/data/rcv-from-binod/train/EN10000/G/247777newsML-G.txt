Vietnam announced the start of a propaganda blitz against illegal drugs on Tuesday as investigators closed in on senior police suspects in a major trafficking case . 
the Communist Party mouthpiece , the Nhan Dan daily , carried a Politburo directive instructing party organisations across the country to step up the war against illegal narcotics . 
it said a new drug-control law would be drafted and ordered government bodies and party members to &quot; take part in propagandizing and encouraging everyone , every family , to understand the danger of drugs &quot; . 
the statement came a day after Hanoi announced the arrest of a senior police drug-squad officer for suspected involvement in a high-profile trafficking case . 
vu Huu Chinh , also referred to as vu Huu Chu , the deputy head of the Interior Ministry &apos;s anti-drug abuse bureau , was arrested on evidence obtained from the death-row confession of a convicted Laotian trafficker . 
police officials refused to comment or provide details , but the arrest was the second in connection with the case . 
a leading Ho Chi Minh City daily reported on Tuesday that orders had been issued on Sunday for the arrest of a more senior officer , but independent confirmation was not immediately available . 
drugs experts say Vietnam , one of the world &apos;s poorest countries , is awash with heroin and opium bound for rich Western nations from the Golden Triangle , where Laos , Thailand and Burma meet . 
Vietnamese authorities say the country has 180,000 addicts . 
but the problem is growing near the Chinese border , where children are being targetted by traffickers in an apparent bid to create a new market . 
the problem is also increasing in Vietnam &apos;s cities . 
liquid opium , known as &quot; black water &quot; is widely used by addicts in Ho Chi Minh City , where it sells for 30-40 U.S. cents a hit .
