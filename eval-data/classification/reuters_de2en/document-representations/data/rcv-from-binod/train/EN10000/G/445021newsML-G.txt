a battle raged for Zaire &apos;s strategic third largest city of Kisangani on Saturday after rebels overran the international airport where soldiers turned on mercenary allies , diplomats and government officials said . 
elsewhere in the city , soldiers of Zaire &apos;s notoriously undisciplined army looted and fled , diplomats and aid workers said . 
a rebel spokesman in the east said rebel forces were advancing into the city , Zaire &apos;s army headquarters in the war zone . 
embassies in Kinshasa advised Western nationals there to stay home for fear of a similar outbreak of looting in the capital , a traditional hotbed of opposition to absent and ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko . 
&quot; The international airport has already been taken and looting has spread across the city , &quot; a senior U.N. official in contact with Kisangani said early on Saturday . 
&quot; The international airport has been taken and fighting is continuing in town , &quot; Raphael Ngenda , a rebel spokesman in the eastern town of Goma , told reporters . 
&quot; I cannot tell if the airport has fallen or not but I have been told there is fierce fighting taking place there , &quot; a Zairean defence ministry spokesman said . 
the fall of Kisangani would be the biggest setback for the government since the rebels took up arms in October , vowing to topple Mobutu . 
they hold a swath of territory in the east . 
France sent in a plane with an escort of 30 paratroops from its base in neighbouring Central African Republic and successfully airlifted out 15 foreign nationals . 
aid sources said they used a smaller airport , almost in town . 
but Prime Minister Alain Juppe ruled out any unilateral military intervention by France , which has been lobbying unsuccessfully for a multi-national force to be sent to help aid get to refugees . 
critics say its aim is to prop up Mobutu . 
&quot; We do not intend to launch again a solely French operation , and , after all , we do not have all the means to carry it out either , &quot; Juppe told a French television network . 
diplomats said the much-heralded battle for Kisangani began with a clash between the soldiers who switched sides and Serb mercenaries guarding the airport . 
&quot; What happened looks distinctly like a betrayal , &quot; a senior government official told Reuters . 
the government deployed soldiers , mercenaries and hardline Rwandan Hutu allies at Kisangani , a major port on the Zaire River that flows west to Kinshasa -- 1,500 km ( 900 miles ) away . 
a regional military source said that two main rebel columns merged to attack the international airport . 
&quot; The mercenaries fled the airport but nobody knows where they have gone . 
some of the senior military seem to have gone across the river , &quot; a senior Western diplomat said on Saturday . 
the regional source said frightened civilians from Kisangani &apos;s 500,000-strong population were massing near the Zaire river , hoping to board barges . 
the Tutsi-led rebels took up arms in October accusing the Zairean authorities of denying them citizenship and preparing to expel them to Rwanda , their ancestral home . 
Zaire accuses neighbouring Rwanda , Uganda and Burundi of invading in support of the rebels . 
all three deny the charge . 
the government has accepted a U.N. ceasefire plan . 
the rebels have resisted diplomatic pressure for a ceasefire . 
Mobutu has been out of the country for most of the time since August when he had prostate cancer surgery in Europe .
