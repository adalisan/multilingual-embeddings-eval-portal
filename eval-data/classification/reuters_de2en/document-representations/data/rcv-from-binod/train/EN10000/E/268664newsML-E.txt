Thai Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan said on Thursday he would tighten government spending and make big budget public projects a lower priority as part of his plan to curb the country &apos;s current account deficit . 
Amnuay told businessmen and bankers he would put more emphasis on fiscal restraints , rather than on austere monetary measures that hurt private business , in tackling the current account deficit , projected at 8.2 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) this year . 
he said government projects that yield few employment opportunities or require big foreign exchange funding should be made a lower priority . 
&quot; Up till now , we may have been a bit complacent and easy on government spendings because of our eight consecutive years of fiscal surpluses , &quot; he told a business seminar . 
the minister said he was confident that Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh would honour a public pledge made during his election campaign in October that he would hold back major military spendings on arms and weapons . 
&quot; We should not worry ... that the prime minister would not keep his word to put a moratorium on big military spendings , &quot; he said . 
Amnuay said he would give a high priority to further liberalising the Thai financial sector and to helping private business find cheaper funding costs . 
he said the private sector was Thailand &apos;s main engine of growth , accounting for about 70 percent of its GDP .
