Oslo shares tip-toed slightly higher on Wednesday as sharply firmer Norwegian bonds and large gains in industrial giant Norsk hydro helped to drag the reluctant market higher , dealers said . 
the lack of an interest rate move by the U.S. Federal Reserve failed to inspire a response and investor cautiousness was likely to remain until after the presentation of Norway &apos;s national budget on October 4 , they said . 
Oslo &apos;s Total share index edged up 0.1 percent to close around mid range at 841.31 points . 
turnover was a moderate 676 million crowns . 
high oil prices and a slight improvement in aluminium helped reverse recent losses on Norsk hydro , which advanced six crowns in a late spurt to 310 crowns . 
but the steam ran out of this week &apos;s rally by shipbuilder , engineering and construction group Kvaerner , which retreated six crowns in the A stock to 248 crowns . 
dealers said the Central Bank &apos;s quarterly inflation report met market expectations and concerns over future rises in consumer prices due to wage growth remained high . 
but all eyes would be on the government &apos;s 1997 budget proposal , they said .
