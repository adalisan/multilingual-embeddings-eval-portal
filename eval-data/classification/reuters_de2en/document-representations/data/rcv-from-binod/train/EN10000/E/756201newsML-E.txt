Britain &apos;s economy grew an annual 3.4 percent in the second quarter of 1997 , official figures showed Friday , well above what most economists view as a sustainable rate . 
the Office for National Statistics reported economic growth of 0.9 percent in the second quarter over the first , a rate that underlines the strength of the economy and will increase pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates again soon . 
&quot; It is well above trend growth and keeps the alert on for higher interest rates , &quot; said Peter Luxton , economist at mms International . 
most economists say the &quot; trend rate &quot; of growth , which an economy can sustain without fuelling inflation , is no more than 2.5 percent . 
the British economy has been rattling along faster than that for some time . 
the Bank of England &apos;s monetary policy committee , now free to set interest rates in order to keep inflation under control , meets next on Aug . 6 and 7 . 
after three quarter-point increases in as many months , taking base rates to 6.75 percent , Britain &apos;s beleaguered manufacturers were praying they are not tightened again soon . 
but their pleas might fall on deaf ears . 
the GDP data showed Britain &apos;s economic recovery remains very much on a twin track . 
the booming service sector again led the way , chalking up growth of 4.5 percent year-on-year in the three months to the end of June . 
in stark contrast , the ons said manufacturing output was only &quot; broadly flat &quot; over the latest three months . 
the soaring pound is the main problem of Britain &apos;s manufacturers , and exporters in particular . 
the higher it climbs , the more expensive exports become abroad . 
the pound &apos;s strength also cuts the price of imported goods , making it harder for British producers to compete in the buoyant domestic market . 
&quot; The robust overall growth figure conceals a growing imbalance between the manufacturing and service sectors , &quot; said Jonathan Loynes , UK economist at HSBC Markets .
