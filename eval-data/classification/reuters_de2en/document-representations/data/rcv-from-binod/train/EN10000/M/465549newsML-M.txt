oil markets had dipped back into negative territory by the close of play on Tuesday after late selling came into the markets . 
prices had earlier moved upwards when European and Asian markets found support from late season buying on the New York Mercantile Exchange &apos;s heating oil . 
recent cold weather the the U.S. saw heating oil lead the markets upwards but by the end of the day this was the only product to hold its strength . 
news of Russian Labor disputes had also supported prices , dealers said . 
&quot; We &apos;re seeing a relatively sloppy physical market finding some encouragement from headline driven trading on the futures exchanges , &quot; said Morgan Stanley analyst Lloyd Byrne . 
London May futures for North Sea bellwether Brent ended the day four cents lower at $ 19.55 a barrel , after earlier climbing to as high as $ 19.77 . 
news of a planned strike on Thursday by up to 20 million people in Russia , a major oil producer and exporter , to protest wage arrears and government policy served as grist for traders looking to boost prices . 
&quot; I think some bulls began putting the Russian story about to talk it up , &quot; a trader said . 
markets remained vulnerable to fundamental weakness , as persistently robust supplies in the North Sea were still courting buying interest from United States refiners , dealers said . 
but rangebound trading was expected ahead of the release of U.S. inventory data later on Tuesday . 
prices received only notional support from the continued loss of 100,000 barrels per day of Nigerian crude oil production to a civil uprising there , as Anglo-Dutch operator Royal Dutch / Shell said its exports would be unaffected . 
Nigeria , with output of about 2.15 million bpd , is the fifth largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum exporting Countries ( OPEC ) .
