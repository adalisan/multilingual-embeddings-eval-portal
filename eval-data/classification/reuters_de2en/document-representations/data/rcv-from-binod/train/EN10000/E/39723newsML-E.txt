the Australian consumer price index ( CPI ) will show zero quarterly growth in the December quarter , forecasters Access Economics said on Monday . 
&quot; This figure is solely driven by the move in mortgage interest rates , which will mainly impact in the December quarter , &quot; said Access analyst Chris Richardson . 
&quot; underlying in the quarter will still be 0.6 , &quot; he told Reuters . 
the Reserve Bank of Australia eased monetary policy on July 31 , dropping its target rate for overnight cash to 7.0 percent from 7.5 percent . 
banks immediately announced lower home-loan interest rates -- which are counted in the Australian CPI -- but most of their customers will not get the cut until September , so it will make little difference to quarterly accommodation costs until the December quarter . 
Richardson thought the Reserve Bank might exploit the freak December quarter inflation number to drive home a message to the public that price restraint reduces interest rates . 
&quot; If the Reserve Bank is going to ram home this result and its significance , then it may well provide a monetary easing as a pay-off , especially if it was already looking for a trigger , &quot; he said . 
access forecast a 0.6 percent CPI rise in the September and March quarters and 0.9 percent for the June quarter 1997 .
