the Indonesian rupiah dropped to a new low on Friday , triggering sales of other Southeast Asian currencies a day after the rupiah was effectively floated . 
it quickly lost a early firm tone and fell to a record low of 2,890 to the dollar as overnight rates dropped back to 30 percent from an early high of 125 percent . 
overnight rates shot up due to the central bank &apos;s tight short-term monetary policy and the maturity on Friday of its intervention on Wednesday . 
the central bank sold about $ 500 million to defend the rupiah from a speculative onslaught on Wednesday . 
&quot; People are just toying around with the rupiah and it &apos;s affecting the other currencies as well . 
we &apos;re looking for 3,000 on dollar / rupiah at some point , &quot; a Singapore-based dealer said . 
on Thursday , Bank Indonesia gave up its system of managing the exchange rate through the use of an intervention band . 
analysts hailed the move as a welcome response to currency and economic turmoil in the region , which has highlighted the need for greater exchange rate flexibility . 
the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) welcomed the float , saying it would allow the Indonesian economy to continue its recent impressive performance . 
&quot; In present circumstances , a floating exchange rate will enhance the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies aimed at sustaining high rates of growth with financial stability , &quot; said acting IMF managing director Stanley Fischer . 
dealers said the rupiah &apos;s decline hit other Southeast Asian currencies , pushing the Singapore dollar to a 37-month low of 1.5220 to the U.S. dollar . 
&quot; Nowadays , the regional currencies are traded as a group so if any one of them is being attacked , the rest of them will be pushed down as well , &quot; the Singapore dealer said . 
speculation of intervention by Singapore monetary authorities helped the Singapore dollar recover from its lows , but dealers said it was still heading for 1.53 . 
the Malaysian ringgit also slipped as fallout from the rupiah pushed it down to 2.7900 / 30 to the dollar against 2.7650 / 700 late on Thursday . 
dealers said the worst was not over for the ringgit given weak sentiment and the volatility in regional currencies . 
they said the risk to the 2.80 level and beyond remained intact though the dollar was expected to face strong resistance at 2.7950 . 
the Thai baht eased on continued commercial demand for the dollar , but activity was relatively muted , dealers said . 
they said the market was awaiting an official announcement of a reported cabinet reshuffle , but this was expected to have limited impact on the baht . 
the baht was at 31.60 / 31.70 to the dollar in the domestic market against 31.50 / 31.60 late on Thursday . 
it was at 31.50 / 60 in offshore markets . 
the Philippine peso fell to 29.71 / 81 to the dollar at 0430 GMT against its previous close at 29.49 . 
Manila traders said the central bank continued to quote offer rates for the dollar at 10 centavos above the best market offer . 
the peso was expected to test a record low of 30 , but dealers said some support was likely at 29.85 . 
the Taiwan dollar &apos;s decline was cushioned by central bank sales of the U.S. dollar near T $ 28.727 in the face of persistent demand from importers .
