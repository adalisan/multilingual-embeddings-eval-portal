* Most regional foreign exchange markets closed for Labour Day holiday on Thursday . 
trading will resume on Friday . 
* Indonesian rupiah sees slow trade due to holiday in other centres . 
most Southeast Asian currencies were thinly traded in overseas markets on Thursday as Malaysia , Singapore and Thailand were closed for the Labour Day holiday . 
in Indonesia , the rupiah was steady in subdued dealings as the absence of offshore players limited activity in Jakarta spot and swap markets . 
a Japanese bank dealer said there was barely any trade , with most activity focused on the money market . 
spot rupiah was quoted at 2,432.50 / 33.00 at 0430 GMT against an opening of 2,430.0 / 31.0 . 
the rupiah has fallen steadily since last week on fears of possible violence during the campaign for Indonesia &apos;s general elections on May 29 . 
the currency recovered some ground as the campaign , which started on Sunday , has been relatively peaceful but underlying sentiment remains cautious . 
dealers said liquidity appeared to be sufficient at present , with some local banks seen looking for short-term money . 
Bank Indonesia raised its intervention band by one point to 2,407 / 2,599 and the conversion band to 2,409 / 2,457 on Wednesday .
