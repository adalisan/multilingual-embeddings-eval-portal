Serbian protesters on foot and in cars defied police cordons on Wednesday to jam central Belgrade in their 52nd consecutive day of protests against President Slobodan Milosevic . 
one opposition leader , Vuk Draskovic , urged anyone not already out on the streets to bring their car into central Belgrade to join the demonstration . 
&quot; If the police block us , we shall block them . 
everyone must go out into the streets , wherever you are -- take whistles , pots and pans and go out into the streets . 
there must be half a million people , &quot; Draskovic said . 
several cars pretended to break down at the entrance to the tunnel running under the main Terazije throughfare . 
drivers set up red emergency triangles on the highway and stood peering at their engines . 
hundreds of people feigning concern surrounded a car which pretended to stall on the tram tracks on Revolution Boulevard . 
police sent out tow trucks ready to remove vehicles . 
Zajedno came up with the idea of giant traffic jams to get round a ban on protest marches imposed after clashes between opposition and pro-government demonstrators on December 24 . 
the Yugoslav Left ( JUL ) party of Milosevic &apos;s wife Mirjana Markovic wrote to foreign embassies asking them to &quot; raise their voice against the public call to terrorism , violence , intolerance and intimidation being made by the Zajedno coalition under the guise of democracy &quot; . 
JUL said a bomb was thrown at its headquarters on Monday , causing damage but no injuries . 
Zajedno denied involvement and said the bombing was staged . 
Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic expressed support for the demonstrators , saying they had shown that not all Serbs wanted to be tarred with the brush of totalitarianism . 
&quot; I have offered my support to the students because they protest only when fundamental values of the people and the state such as freedom and democracy are under threat , &quot; she said . 
Bosnian Serbs resent Milosevic for helping force them into a 1995 peace accord with Moslems amd Croats preserving a single Bosnia after initially backing their war for a separate state . 
but the Serb nationalist member of Bosnia &apos;s collective presidency , Momcilo Krajisnik , said he could not support all elements of the opposition coalition . 
&quot; We have no right to support people who wholeheartedly worked against the Serb people and the RS ( Bosnian Serb entity ) , made public apologies to Moslems and called on the international community to bomb Serbs , &quot; he told Pale radio . 
students at their daily demonstration played a good-natured game of cat-and-mouse with police deployed to prevent them from marching and at one point managed to pass through the police cordon and come up on them from behind . 
on Thursday , the students plan to line up in front of the police cordon and refuse to leave until they are let through . 
groups of about 100 will rotate every hour . 
the opposition accuses the government of robbing it of victory by cancelling results of November local elections in 15 of Serbia &apos;s largest towns including Belgrade .
