floor sources said a player entered the market early to signal it would buy 300 lots at 73.25 cents per pound in the March contract . 
&quot; They were willing to buy but it never got down there , though it had some people scared and the market ran up on shortcovering , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; However , it then met fund selling above the market which brought it back down again . 
March settled 0.21 cent firmer at 73.77 cents per pound , traded 74.80 to 73.65 cents . 
volume was estimated at 10,000 lots , up from Thursday &apos;s official 8,471 lots . 
before the market opened , the U.S. Dept of Agriculture released its January world supply / demand , stocks and export data , but there were no major changes to estimates contained in the December report . 
there was little impact on dealings .
