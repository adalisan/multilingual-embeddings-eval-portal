Croatian stocks were mixed in livelier trade on Wednesday , but traders say investors are holding back pending government resolution of a share ownership row . 
&quot; People are staying out of the market until the situation stabilises and the ownership issue is resolved , &quot; said Michael Glazer from Auctor brokerage . 
&quot; Any sort of uncertainty makes foreign investors very nervous . 
last week Croatia &apos;s National Security Council called for the annulment of some 20,000 contracts for purchases of shares at reduced prices under the employee buy-out scheme . 
these contracts were judged illegal for having exceeded a 20,000-German-mark ceiling per person . 
traders said on Wednesday the government was unlikely to go through with voiding all illegal contracts as some shares bought in this way were being traded on the secondary capital market . 
&quot; It would create chaos , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; If somebody wanted to scare foreign investors away , this is just a kind of thing to do . 
an analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said the government was not expected to carry out the call initiated by the Council . 
&quot; We expect a resolution of the issue that would make investors feel comfortable again , &quot; he said . 
Wednesday &apos;s volume soared to 25,556 shares from Tuesday &apos;s 2,806 , and so did turnover at 24.1 million kuna ( $ 4.5 million ) , up from 0.7 million . 
this happened mostly thanks to heavy trade with one of the two fully listed issues , Zagrebacka Banka , which recovered 20 kuna to close at 1,000 on a record volume of 22,688 shares . 
&quot; This shows confidence in the bank , which was privatised in a different way from other companies and was not affected by the ownership issue , &quot; said one broker . 
another blue chip issue , drug firm Pliva , lost 600 kuna to close at 12,700 , following a downward trend at the London Stock Exchange where its global depository receipts , issued 50 for a share , were traded in the $ 47.37- $ 47.75 range on Wednesday . 
other popular issues that were intensely traded in the past few weeks were hit by the ownership question . 
only two hoteliers were traded . 
Suncani Hvar gained 10 kuna to close at 70 , with 1,088 shares traded , and Jadranturist traded flat at 275 kuna , with only 100 shares sold . 
Podravka food concern lost 10 kuna to close at 240 , on meagre volume of 50 shares . 
( $ 1 = 5.3945 kuna ) 
( $ = 5.358 Croatian Kuna )
