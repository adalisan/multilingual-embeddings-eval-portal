Europe &apos;s key bourses surged to new closing highs on Friday when Wall Street rose strongly again after two days of 80-point gains . 
&quot; We &apos;ve seen a great performance today , which should restore confidence to a worried market , &quot; one trader in London said . 
London , Europe &apos;s biggest bourse , rose 47.4 points , or 1.21 percent , to close at a record 4,275.8 points , up 57 points since the start of the week . 
when London closed , Wall Street was up 33 points after digesting stronger than expected fourth quarter U.S. gross domestic product data showing annualised growth of 4.7 percent . 
U.S. traders concentrated on other inflation measures in the GDP report which suggested the rate of price rises remained generally in check , a factor which pushed U.S. bonds higher . 
London traders said the fate of the market next week depended on monetary meetings in both Britain and the United States . 
an interest rate hike on either side of the Atlantic could bring the FTSE tumbling back down to earth , they said . 
&quot; It could still be a white-knuckle ride next week , &quot; the London trader said . 
the spectre of a sharp sell-off sparked by a U.S. rate rise will keep markets nervous ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee rate policy meeting on February 4 and 5 , dealers said . 
February 4 is the third anniversary of an unexpected U.S interest rate hike which sent world stock markets reeling . 
some analysts believe history could repeat itself . 
&quot; It &apos;s a fateful anniversary , &quot; he said . 
&quot; On balance we &apos;re not expecting a rate rise but its definitely quite a close call . 
nerves will be further frayed by Britain &apos;s monthly monetary meeting on Wednesday , which could result in a rate rise . 
higher interest rates would sorely test the world &apos;s share markets , many of which are at or near record levels , by making returns on alternative investments and cash more attractive . 
in Paris , the CAC 40 index was up 13.50 , or 0.54 percent , at 2,516.56 , a new record . 
it rose 3.5 percent during the week . 
Alcatel Alsthom ended up 4.78 percent at 548 francs , having forecast a spectacular rebound to a profit of 2.5 billion francs for 1996 from a loss of 25.6 billion in 1995 . 
in Frankfurt , the DAX index closed up 17.83 points , or 0.59 percent , at 3,035.15 , also a new record . 
SAP rose nearly 11 percent after the blue-chip software group shocked the market by beating its own results forecasts for 1996 . 
Porsche also rose 10.5 percent , after announcing strong profits . 
the dollar steadied in late Europe after a volatile session as the market absorbed the U.S. economic data . 
by 1700 GMT , it was worth 1.6360 marks and 121.10 yen , a touch down from Thursday &apos;s late European levels . 
&quot; It &apos;s the same old story -- strong growth , but subdued inflation , &quot; said John Calverley , chief economist and strategist at American Express Bank in London . 
while strong , the figures would not change the U.S. interest rate outlook , analysts said . 
&quot; The dollar is just sort of consolidating , &quot; said Peter von Maydell , senior currency economist at UBS . 
&quot; Today &apos;s data is just an excuse to maintain that , &quot; he said , adding that many dealers had taken profits and closed their books for the month . 
the pound was also vulnerable after heavy selling against the dollar and yen spilled over into mark trade . 
there were signs that British interest rates may not rise as soon as expected , traders said . 
in late trade , the pound was at $ 1.5995 and 2.6185 marks . 
gold remained weak in the afternoon , closing at $ 344.60 , its lowest for 3-1 / 4 years . 
it has plunged from about $ 370 at the start of the year , haaving been shunned by investors who prefer to pour money into the booming the U.S. stock market . 
the dollar was quoted at 1.6360 marks and 121.10 yen , compared with late Thursday &apos;s European levels of 1.6382 marks and 121.61 yen . 
gold closed at $ 344.60 , down sharply from Thursday &apos;s close in Europe of $ 347.35 .
