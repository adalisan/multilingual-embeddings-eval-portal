the dollar bowed out of European trading off highs but holding the bulk of session gains against the yen after an ebullient response to verbal intervention from Japanese and U.S. officials . 
Japan &apos;s finance ministry came out in support of the Bank of Japan &apos;s low interest-rate policy , while the BOJ said the yen &apos;s correction of its weakness was too rapid . 
U.S. Trade Secretary Robert Rubin reiterated the U.S. strong dollar policy . 
&quot; It &apos;s clear from the comments of Japanese officials that they want to stabilise the yen , &quot; said Nick Stamenkovic , economist at DKB International in London . 
&quot; If we did see further appreciation of dollar / yen I think you &apos;ll see Japanese officials start to talk the yen up again , but they &apos;ll be wary of being too aggressive because of what &apos;s happened in the last few weeks , &quot; said Stamenkovic . 
the dollar was quoted at 116.00 / 10 yen at 1527 GMT , narrowly off a session high of 116.33 but far above late Wednesday &apos;s European level of 113.60 / 70 . 
the fears of higher Japanese interest rates which have been spooking dollar / yen are now abating , analysts said . 
the dollar also got a lift today from the Swiss National Bank &apos;s decision to leave official interest rates unchanged . 
dollar / Swiss was quoted at 1.4111 / 16 francs at 1544 GMT versus late yesterday &apos;s 1.4058 / 63 . 
that helped support dollar / mark , which firmed a touch to 1.6938 / 43 from 1.6916 / 21 . 
the dollar wobbled against the German unit earlier , however , after new data generated optimism over Germany &apos;s economic outlook and the Bundesbank dampened speculation of monetary easing there . 
the IFO business climate index for April jumped to 94.7 from 92.6 -- which took the sting out of a lower than expected 6.7 percent expansion in April German M3 money supply . 
&quot; The IFO was very strong , and Germany seems to be moving ahead in its recovery , &quot; said Ernesto Ramirez , European economist at Bankers Trust . 
Bundesbank council member Olaf Sievert said there was no current leeway for further rate cuts , though he added that there was no reason to consider higher rates in the near future . 
the inflation prospects for the current year were favourable , Sievert said . 
elsewhere , sterling / mark slid more than three pfennigs by the European close to stand at 2.7572 / 77 marks by 1602 GMT versus late Wednesday &apos;s 2.7910 / 20 . 
dealers said that had helped cap dollar / mark . 
&quot; There is an interest to sell sterling and sterling / mark . 
that is affecting dollar / mark , &quot; said Peter Wood , foreign exchange dealer at Bank of Boston here . 
the Czech crown took another pounding , hitting a record low against its dollar / mark basket and prompting Czech National Bank ( CNB ) buying and a move to limit access to the money market for non-resident investors . 
the crown rose to about 3.5 percent below its mid point of the dollar / mark basket after the CNB action from its record low of minus 6.4 percent before .
