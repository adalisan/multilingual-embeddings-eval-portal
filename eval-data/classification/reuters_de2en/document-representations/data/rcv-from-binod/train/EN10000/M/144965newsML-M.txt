China &apos;s foreign currency B share markets , stuck in a deep depression for two years despite a bull run on the domestic markets , will remain in the doldrums for the rest of 1996 , stock analysts said on Friday . 
they cited the lack of government support , including repeated bans on local Chinese trading in B shares , and declining overseas investor confidence due to poor company results as the two most important factors . 
by Friday &apos;s close , Shanghai &apos;s B share index was little changed at 48.239 points against 47.69 points at the close of the last trading day in 1995 . 
Shanghai &apos;s A share index surged about 90 percent over the same period . 
during this period , Shenzhen &apos;s B share index rose about 50 percent to 90.00 points , compared to a rise of more than 200 percent on the exchange &apos;s A share market . 
combined average daily turnover of the A markets is about 20 billion yuan ( $ 2.41 billion ) against only tens of millions of dollars on the two B share markets . 
&quot; The ( B share ) markets have become extremely dull , &quot; said one broker with a major Chinese brokerage . 
&quot; There is no hope that they will recover before the end of this year . 
a stock analyst said repeated bans on local Chinese trading B shares showed that the central government would not allow the markets to expand quickly in the short term . 
&quot; The authorities seem to have no clear model for the B share markets in their minds , &quot; the analyst said . 
in contrast , policy support for the A share markets , including morale-boosting speeches by top securities officials , was a key factor for the markets &apos; rise this year , analysts said . 
analysts said B share companies as a whole had performed worse than A share firms in the past two years , mainly due to poor management and being hit harder by Beijing &apos;s austerity measures in force since 1993 . 
&quot; Foreign investor confidence has greatly been hurt by the past two years of poor results by B share firms , &quot; said a Shanghai-based investment analyst with a Western brokerage . 
&quot; Unless there is solid evidence that their performance will improve in the short term , the B markets will not recover . 
analysts said recent surges of stocks on the Hong Kong exchange , including shares of Chinese firms , were another major negative factor for the B share markets . 
&quot; Foreigners are shifting investments to H-share companies , &quot; said an analyst with a Shanghai branch of a Hong Kong brokerage . 
Beijing established the B share markets in 1992 to allow major companies to raise foreign funds . 
Chinese securities rules say that only foreigners may buy the B shares . 
in the first two years , B shares were almost solely in the hands of foreigners but a deep market depression since mid-1994 persuaded the two exchanges to quietly allow local investors to trade B shares . 
by June and July this year , local participation peaked , with brokers estimating that Chinese accounted for 60 percent of B share trading in Shenzhen and 40 percent in Shanghai . 
the China Securities Regulatory Commission , the watchdog , then issued a series of orders re-affirming the ban on local trading in B shares . 
brokers say this sharply reduced the scale of local participation and B share trading volume .
