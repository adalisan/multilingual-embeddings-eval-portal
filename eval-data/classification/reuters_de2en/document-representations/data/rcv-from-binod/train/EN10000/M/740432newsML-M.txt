Australian bond yields finished higher , largely reflecting extreme weakness in the neighbouring New Zealand market and further softness in U.S. treasuries during Tokyo trading . 
&quot; The kiwi market got absolutely caned and the U.S. came off a bit more , so we really played catch-up to that . 
( Bernie ) Fraser had no real impact , a basis point at most , &quot; said one bond trader . 
&quot; People think he &apos;s been out of the post too long now . 
former Reserve Bank governor Fraser told a conference in Melbourne that the monetary authorities had missed an opportunity to cut rates a fifth time in the past year . 
Fraser , who stepped down as governor last September , sent the Australian dollar into frenzy last December when he said policy should have been loosened faster and further . 
the comments actually held back the RBA from easing until the currency settled down . 
the market faces a key week next week , which may settle whether the the RBA can ease policy for a fifth time this cycle . 
second quarter inflation and wages data are due on Wednesday and Thursday . 
median forecasts centre on a 0.1 percent quarterly fall in the headline CPI , according to a Reuters survey of economists . 
this would give an annual rate of just 0.5 percent , while the policy sensitive underlying rate is seen rising 0.5 percent for annual growth of a mere 1.7 percent . 
average weekly ordinary time earnings are seen up 0.8 percent for an annual 4.1 percent . 
such inflation outcomes would be far superior to that of the U.S. and is expected to trigger a further sharp narrowing in the yield spread to the U.S. 
although a Reuters poll of economists taken on Friday found expectations for the Australian / U.S. 
10-year bond yield spread at year-end centring on a median 50 basis points , some see a test of parity before then . 
the local negative yield spreads to New Zealand grew sharply after the debt market adjusted to take account of plunge in the N.Z. 
meanwhile , Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is due to deliver his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony next week . 
the 10-year bond contract struck a fresh 3-1 / 2 year high of 93.510 during SYCOM trade .
