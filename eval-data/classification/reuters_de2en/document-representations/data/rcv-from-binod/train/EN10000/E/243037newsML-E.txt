a significant relaxation of South African monetary policy could not be expected before the second quarter of 1999 as the protection of the balance of payments remained a top government priority , a Sanlam economist said . 
in his latest economic overview , Johan Louw said that he expected next year &apos;s budget to show sustained and even increased efforts to control the rise in current expenditure . 
there would also be greater emphasis on indirect taxation with VAT rising by one percent to 15 percent while the deficit would be reduced to four percent of GDP . 
&quot; In this regard , privatisation of government assets could play a meaningful role , &quot; Louw said . 
he expected fiscal action to have a &quot; largely neutral &quot; effect on the economy . 
economic growth was expected to be 2.3 percent against this year &apos;s three percent while inflation would average 10 percent compared with 7.5 percent this year . 
he predicted a more stable rand / dollar exchange rate and a one percent cut in the bank rate during the second quarter of 1997 &quot; followed by a further downward adjustment of the same magnitude late in the year . 
&quot; A favourable trend is the continuing improvement in the current account of the balance of payments , &quot; Louw said . 
&quot; As opposed to the unfavourable balance of 12.6 billion rand in 1995 , Sanlam estimates that the deficit will decrease to approximately eight billion rand in 1996 . 
a further improvement was expected in 1997 , when the current account shortfall was forecast to be 2 billion rand . 
Louw attributed this improvement to a &quot; marked &quot; increase in the value of merchandise exports to 120.7 billion rand from an estimated 99.8 billion rand in 1996 because of the expected synchronised recovery of the world economy and the weaker rand . 
the value of gold exports was also expected to rise to about 27.4 billion rand from 23.7 billion rand because of a moderate rise in the dollar price of gold and the weaker rand . 
merchandise imports were expected to rise to 130.7 billion rand from 113.8 billion rand , mainly due to the weaker rand rather than a major increase in volumes . 
net payments for services and transfers were expected to grow more slowly next year to 19.4 billion rand compared to an estimated 17.7 billion rand this year . 
&quot; It appears that the balance of payments position and the state of the foreign reserves will continue to hamper the relaxation of exchange control regulations regarding investments abroad by local institutions , &quot; Louw said . 
&quot; However , further concessions cannot be ruled out . 
as a developing country with a high unemployment rate , South Africa should not be a net exporter of capital . 
&quot; It therefore stands to reason that exchange controls can be abolished only if there is a reasonable degree of certainty that the country will experience a greater inflow than outflow of money , &quot; Louw said . 
this would only happen if government made noticeable progress in implementing its new economic programme , privatisation got underway and unrest and crime was reduced to more acceptable levels .
