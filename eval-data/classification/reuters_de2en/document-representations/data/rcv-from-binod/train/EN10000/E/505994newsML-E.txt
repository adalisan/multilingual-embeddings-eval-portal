the Czech National Bank said on Monday it still had no definite release date for January &apos;s M2 money supply data , eagerly sought by financial analysts , although the figures may come soon . 
&quot; definitely not today . 
maybe tomorrow or after tomorrow , &quot; Pavel Palivec , a CNB spokesman , told Reuters . 
&quot; No legal norms &quot; require a release of M2 data , he said , adding that slow reporting of commercial banks was partly to blame for the tardier-than-usual release . 
the CNB has never set a release date for its key money supply figure , but for 1996 M2 data , the lag time was around one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half months after the period being measured . 
the last data release was on March 13 , when the CNB said M2 at the end of December last year was 7.8 percent higher than the same month in the previous year , a slowing from November which showed a rise of 9.7 percent year-on-year . 
November &apos;s results were released on January 23 . 
analysts are watching M2 closely since the growth in the money supply slowed from the double-digit rate last year ahead of central bank tightening in June . 
the Czech government has said a drop in the 12-month inflation rate to 6.8 percent in March from around nine percent for much of 1996 came at too high a cost because of a slowdown in economic growth . 
the cabinet &apos;s criticism has had many analysts watching for a possible lowering of interest rates , monetary conditions permitting .
