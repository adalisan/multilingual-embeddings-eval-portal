the won closed Friday &apos;s trading weaker due to dollar short covering and the U.S. unit &apos;s strength against the Japnese yen in the Tokyo market , traders said . 
they added there was active dollar buying by foreign stock market investors who felt the won had strengthened enough to convert their bourse earnings . 
the won closed at 857.10 , compared to Thursday &apos;s close of 854.90 . 
the unit opened trading at a high of 854.00 and touched a low of 857.30 . 
dollar selling intervention by the central bank at the 857.00 level had little impact on trading , dealers said . 
&quot; Next week , I see the dollar continue to strengthen slowly , starting at around 857 and rising , &quot; said a European bank dealer . 
Friday saw the first decline in the won since a central bank official earlier this week said the bank would actively try to stabilise the domestic currency &apos;s fall . 
the central bank has refused to confirm or deny talk of its intervention in the interbank market . 
Monday &apos;s base mid-rate was pegged at 856.70 , against Friday &apos;s 855.50 .
