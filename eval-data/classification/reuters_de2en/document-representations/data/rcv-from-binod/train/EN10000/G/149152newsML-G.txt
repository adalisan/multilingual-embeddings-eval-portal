a cassation court in Bahrain has ruled it had no jurisdiction over another court &apos;s death sentences against three Bahrainis for a deadly arson attack , paving the way for their execution , a lawyer said on Monday . 
&quot; The cassation court said it has no jurisdiction over the State Security Court &apos;s decision . 
this means the executions will take place any day now , &quot; said the defence lawyer , who refused to be named . 
Bahrain &apos;s State Security Court in July ordered the execution of the three Bahrainis for the arson attack in March in which seven Bangladeshi restaurant workers died . 
the court also jailed four Bahrainis for life for taking part in the attack . 
another defendant was jailed for 15 years . 
Bahrain in March executed a man for killing a policeman , in the first such move against an anti-government protester since political unrest erupted in this Gulf island in December 1994 . 
the lawyer criticised the cassation court &apos;s Sunday decision , saying &quot; it was not a legal judgment , but a political one . 
this is against article 40 of the law of cassation . 
any death sentence must be referred to the cassation court . 
&quot; The ( cassation ) court only met for two minutes . 
this closed the door on any kind of further discussion of the case , &quot; he said . 
the three who were sentenced to death were named as Ali Ahmed Abdullah al-Asfoor , Youssef Hassan Abdul-Baqi and Ahmed Khalil Ibrahim Hubail al-Katan . 
the State Security Court has sentenced more than 150 people since Bahrain &apos;s government , seeking to accelerate judgments , ordered it in March to try hundreds of detainees held for street protests , sabotage and arson attacks . 
Members of Bahrain &apos;s majority Shi &apos;ite community have been waging a violent campaign to demand political and economic reforms . 
about 27 people , including three policemen and the seven Bangladeshis , have been killed in waves of violence . 
diplomats say the government has over the past few months contained the unrest in the Gulf &apos;s financial and banking centre .
