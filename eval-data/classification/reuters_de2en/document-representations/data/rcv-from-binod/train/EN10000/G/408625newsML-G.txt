France &apos;s opposition Socialists accused the government on Thursday of quietly introducing a new database of French citizens under the pretext of monitoring visitors from developing countries . 
the centre-right government , which had previously denied any register would be set up , acknowledged at a rowdy parliamentary debate on an immigration bill that records would be kept of visitors staying in France . 
&quot; Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre has said there would be a register of visitors . 
there will necessarily be some form of control of hosts , &quot; Socialist former prime minister Laurent Fabius told RTL radio . 
&quot; There is no reason for this law unless it is to say : you are a foreigner and therefore you are a suspect , &quot; he added . 
Socialist leader Lionel Jospin pledged to abolish the law if his party was returned to power in general elections due early next year . 
the Socialists , France &apos;s biggest opposition force , have over the past few days sought to jump back into the spotlight after initial opposition to the bill was spearheaded by film-makers , artists and intellectuals . 
the party pressed the government by arguing in favour of a host of amendments which , given the government &apos;s overwhelming majority , had no chance of survival . 
as in Wednesday &apos;s session , Gaullist National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin had to intervene several times to appeal for calm . 
at the debate , black Socialist deputy Camille Darsieres had denounced &quot; a time of shameful and rampant racism &quot; and expressed her solidarity with &quot; all immigrants who reside in France &quot; . 
the lower house approved a key article of the bill which authorises police and the para-military gendarmerie to keep the passports or travel documents of illegal immigrants , and allows searches of commercial vehicles within 20 km ( 12 miles ) of the border . 
the article also authorises police to take and store fingerprints of foreigners from outside the European Union who apply for a residence permit . 
the Assembly is expected to approve the bill in a vote after finishing its final reading on Thursday evening . 
the Senate should start debating it on March 11 . 
boosted by its strong majority , the centre-right government on Wednesday pushed through an amendment which dropped a requirement that French citizens must report to local authorities the departure of their foreign guests . 
instead , guests will themselves have to report their departure to police . 
in another clash on the immigration bill , France sought help from the European Union to rein in the European Parliament after condemning it for urging Paris to withdraw the plan . 
foreign Minister Herve de Charette said he would ask foreign ministers from the other 14 nations &quot; to reflect on the European Parliament &apos;s exceeding its responsibilities &quot; . 
the bill , opposed by groups from artists to human rights campaigners , aims to close loopholes in tough existing laws dating from 1993 and would grant the police extended powers to track immigrants in France . 
the opposition has accused the conservative government of pandering to the growing numbers of voters for the extreme-right National Front with an eye on general elections in 1998 .
