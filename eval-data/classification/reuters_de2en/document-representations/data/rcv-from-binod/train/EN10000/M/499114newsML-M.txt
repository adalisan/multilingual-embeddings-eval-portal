NWE gasoline weakened on Thursday as healthy prompt barge supplies pressured prices and NYMEX unleaded took a tumble to keep the arbitrage door tightly shut , traders said . 
Eurograde barges traded at $ 187 , $ 188 and $ 189 fob Ara for prompt pre-April 20 delivery against deals for similar material done at $ 190 , $ 192 and $ 193 on Wednesday . 
First-half May material traded twice at $ 192 . 
swaps were also under pressure with April paper seen around $ 187 / $ 189 fob Ara , while May paper traded at $ 192.75 and was then talked around $ 191 / $ 192.50 . 
traders said prompt Eurograde barge material was coming under severe pressure as a former dominant buyer sought to off-load material it amassed last month . 
&quot; They appear to have been stuck with rather a lot of stuff , &quot; said one trader . 
added to this prompt NYMEX unleaded futures remained weak with the May contract trading 0.40 cent off at 60.30 cents per gallon at 1707 GMT , having fallen as low as 59.60 cents earlier in the session , keeping the arbitrage door firmly shut . 
traders said that until the arbitrage door opened the market would remain under pressure .
