South African captain Hansie Cronje &apos;s aggressive 85 off 96 balls failed to prevent Glamorgan easing to a six-wicket victory over Ireland in the Benson and hedges Cup on Tuesday . 
Cronje &apos;s innings , which included three sixes and six fours , helped Ireland to 202 for nine in their group D tie . 
but Glamorgan were rarely troubled as they reached their target with 19.2 overs remaining , courtesy of a third-wicket stand of 91 between Matthew Maynard and Adrian Dale . 
the Minor Counties &apos; hopes of an upset against Lancashire were derailed by seamers Ian Austin and Peter Martin who each finished with three wickets . 
chasing the holders &apos; 210 for seven , the Minor Counties seemed on course for victory at 60 for no wicket , but eventually fell 35 runs short . 
Yorkshire went top of group A after beating Warwickshire by five wickets , helped by 67 off 65 balls from Australian Darren Lehmann . 
they will qualify for the last eight if they beat the Minor Counties next week , with the second place apparently between Warwickshire and Derbyshire , who meet at Derby . 
Derbyshire stayed in the chase after beating Worcestershire by 20 runs , despite Australian Tom Moody &apos;s 77 in his side &apos;s unsuccessful pursuit of the home team &apos;s 231 . 
Leicestershire guaranteed their quarter-final place with a 19-run win over Durham in a high-scoring game at Chester-le-Street .
