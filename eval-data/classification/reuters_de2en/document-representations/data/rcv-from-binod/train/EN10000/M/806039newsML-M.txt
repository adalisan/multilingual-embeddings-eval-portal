IMM currency futures finished mixed , with yen closing unchanged , while marks and Swiss francs ended with slim losses , traders said . 
&quot; None of these currencies were able to support a rally , and I think that bodes well for the dollar , &quot; one currency futures analyst said . 
September marks forfeited the day &apos;s meager gains and ended on the downside , as late strength in the U.S. stock market lifted the dollar , traders and analysts said . 
an estimated 24,000 marks traded , with one firm buying 600 at $ 0.5490 . 
volume for yen was estimated at 12,000 contracts . 
traders said expectations for steady U.S. interest rates out of the U.S. Federal Reserve &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) could have weighed on the dollar . 
however , traders said interest rate differentials were on the back-burner , as the market is focusing on U.S. asset markets . 
they said steady rates would most likely lift the U.S. stock market off its recent lows , and thereby increase the demand for dollars . 
in addition , few traders and analysts are looking for the Bundesbank to signal higher German rates at Tuesday &apos;s weekly repo tender . 
concerns that Germany may switch to a variable rate repo , from a fixed rate , for the first time in a year abated . 
Bundesbank council member Hans-Juergen Krupp said on Monday that a German rate rise now would be severely damaging to the domestic economy . 
he said a larger increase would not be justifiable given continued weakness in their economy . 
however , one currency analyst said technicals point to losses in the dollar , and thereby gains in September marks . 
Ben Morden , a currency analyst with I.D.E.A. 
Inc , said dollar / mark could fall to 1.77 spot , which is the equivalent to $ 0.5659 , and the lower end of a channel since November 1996 . 
Morden said 1.8280 to 1.83 spot , or $ 0.5480 to $ 0.5474 in September marks , would act as a short-term cap , and 1.84 to 1.85 spot as a longer-term resistance area . 
the 1.84 to 1.85 spot area would translate into September mark support at $ 0.5444 to $ 0.5415 . 
he said the Bollinger band studies indicated a change in sentiment three days ago . 
call and put options on mark futures contracts were actively traded , with one small firm buying about 400 September 56 calls and a dealer buying 1,200 September 55 puts , traders said . 
September sterling touched buy-stop orders at $ 1.6120 , but dealers quickly placed offers and capped the day &apos;s high at $ 1.6130 , they said . 
September yen closed unchanged , and should continue to trade in a range in the near-term , traders and analysts said . 
at the end of pit trade , September yen was steady at $ 0.008519 , marks were down $ 0.0004 at $ 0.5484 , Swiss francs were down $ 0.0018 at $ 0.6636 , sterling was up $ 0.0038 at $ 1.6092 , Canadian dollars were up $ 0.0009 at $ 0.7215 , Australian dollars were down $ 0.0049 at $ 0.7386 and Mexican pesos were off $ 0.000075 at $ 0.127225 .
