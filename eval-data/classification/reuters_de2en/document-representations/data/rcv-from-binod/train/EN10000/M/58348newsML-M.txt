the ringgit closed slightly higher against the dollar after rates were trapped in a tight trading range throughout Tuesday &apos;s session due to lack of participation , dealers said . 
dealers attributed the ringgit rise to cross trade between the Singapore dollar and ringgit with players selling the Singapore dollar and buying the local currency . 
they said a softer dollar against major currencies also supported the ringgit . 
&quot; Trading was tight throughout as there were no new factors to attract participation , &quot; said one local bank dealer . 
dealers said players also preferred to wait for clearer indications of U.S. credit policy before taking positions . 
at the local 1000 GMT close , the ringgit was at 2.4960 / 67 per dollar against 2.4970 / 80 on Monday . 
on the money market , interbank rates were mostly steady , helped by borrowings by some finance houses . 
the overnight rate , however , fell slightly to 6.00 / 10 percent from 6.20 percent as market liquidity remained ample .
