the dollar is likely to stay in a boxed range against the yen and the mark in Asia on Wednesday ahead of the Christmas holiday overseas , although further falls in Tokyo stocks may lift the dollar / yen slightly up . 
constant dollar sales by Japanese exporters on rises while Japanese investors buy on dips are likely to confine trading to a 114.20-70 yen range , dealers said . 
&quot; The dollar may inch higher against the yen if we see Tokyo stocks weakening further , &quot; said a trust bank dealer . 
&quot; But there isn &apos;t a sense that the dollar will keep rising here amid the Christmas holiday overseas , &quot; he added . 
a city bank dealer said Japanese exporters sold dollars at around 114.40 yen on Tuesday and were expected to keep selling them on rises in Tokyo . 
the dollar briefly touched 114.50 yen overnight . 
even if the dollar clearly breaks through 114.50 yen , it is likely to face further resistance at 114.70 and 114.90 yen before reaching 115.00 yen . 
on the downside , the trust bank dealer said Japanese investment advisory firms sold yen against European currencies related to their foreign securities investments on Tuesday and those sales should continue to support the dollar / yen rate .
