Baltimore Ravens running back Bam Morris was suspended for the first four games of the season by the National Football League Wednesday for violating the league &apos;s substance abuse policy . 
the sanction was the second suspension for Morris , who has been in the league &apos;s substance abuse programme since pleading guilty to a marijuana possession charge last year . 
various reports claimed that Morris , 25 , failed a mandatory drug test several months ago , and learned last week that he had lost his appeal , but the league would not discuss details of the violation . 
Morris , the team &apos;s leading rusher last season , will be allowed to practice with the club until his suspension begins the first week of the regular season . 
he will be eligible to return to the roster September 22 and will be permitted to play September 28 at San Diego . 
&quot; There is concern for Bam from all of us , &quot; said Ravens head coach Ted Marchibroda . 
&quot; At the same time , he let his teammates and our fans down . 
Morris last year pleaded guilty to a felony marijuana possession charge after he was arrested in Rockwall , Texas with more than five pounds ( 2.2 kg ) of marijuana in his car . 
&quot; We believe in the NFL rules and regulations , and the league has found Bam in violation , &quot; Ravens owner Art Modell said . 
&quot; We stand ready to have Bam return to the team providing he continues to adhere to his rehabilitation process , and he maintains a strict conditioning programme . 
the Ravens signed Morris to a two-year contract last September , two months after he was released by the Pittsburgh Steelers . 
in 1996 , he led the Ravens with 737 yards rushing on 172 carries and four touchdowns . 
he also had 25 receptions for 242 yards and a touchdown . 
Morris , who played for the Steelers in their Super bowl xxx loss to Dallas in 1995 , had five carries for 17 yards in the Ravens &apos; exhibition opener , a 21-20 loss to the New York giants last Saturday .
