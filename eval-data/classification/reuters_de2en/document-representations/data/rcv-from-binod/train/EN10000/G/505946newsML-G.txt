Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday rejected a charge by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko on Monday that someone in the Russian government was working on orders from the West . 
in a sign of Russian impatience with the volatile Belarussian leader , Chernomyrdin called for common sense in relations between the two states , which are considering closer integration . 
&quot; I am somewhat bewildered by President Lukashenko &apos;s announcement that there is someone in the Russian leadership &apos; who is fulfilling orders from his overseas masters &apos; to destroy Russian-Belorussian relations , &quot; Interfax news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying . 
&quot; The existence of various opinions among government members in no way means that behind the back of one or another leader is necessarily a prompter from western or eastern special services , &quot; Chernomyrdin told Interfax . 
Liberals newly-appointed to the Russian government , worried by Lukashenko &apos;s authoritarian rule and distaste for capitalism and market reform , helped water down a Union Treaty signed by Lukashenko and Russian President Boris Yeltsin two weeks ago . 
Lukashenko did not hide his dissatisfaction with the hastily re-drafted document , which excluded all concrete measures towards integrating his struggling state with richer Russia . 
the Belarus leader accused Russian reformers of being more interested in the West than in Russia at a meeting with agricultural officials at a collective farm at the village of Khidry in western Belarus last week . 
a charter outlining further steps towards integration has since been published , but could be revised after a period of public discussion due to last another month . 
&quot; Until a decision is taken any issue is open to discussion , &quot; Interfax quoted Chernomyrdin as saying . 
&quot; I hope that in such an important issue as further integration between Russia and Belarus , emotions will not overcome common sense , &quot; it said , quoting Chernomyrdin . 
the Belarussian leadership has suffered a barrage of criticism from European institutions and Washington for its civil rights record but Lukashenko was unrepentant . 
&quot; We don &apos;t need to be taught democracy , &quot; he said .
