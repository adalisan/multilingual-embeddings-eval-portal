Cambodia &apos;s exiled Prince Norodom Sirivudh left Hong Kong for Europe on Thursday after an abortive attempt to fly home to contest charges that he plotted to kill Cambodian Co-Premier Hun Sen. 
an aide to Cambodian first prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh , Xavier d &apos;Abzac , told Reuters in Phnom Penh the prince was on a flight to Europe and was probably heading for Paris . 
Hong Kong officials refused to say where he had gone . 
a Paris-based group of Cambodians supports Sirivudh , who told a French magazine last December he could no longer afford to live in the city . 
Hong Kong &apos;s Dragonair refused to allow Sirivudh on its flight to Phnom Penh on Tuesday , and Royal Air Cambodge also barred the prince from flying after Phnom Penh said he would be arrested on arrival , raising fears about passenger safety . 
&quot; I can confirm the latest situation is that the prince has left Hong Kong , &quot; Mary Leung , a spokeswoman for the government &apos;s Security Branch , told Reuters . 
she declined to say how or when he left , or give his destination . 
a source close to the case earlier told Reuters Sirivudh was trying to head for Beijing and had been in contact with Chinese officials to work out travel arrangements . 
there were unconfirmed rumours that he would meet Cambodia &apos;s King Norodom Sihanouk in Beijing . 
while in Hong Kong , Sirivudh said he would persist in efforts to go home and seek a fair trial . 
he switched hotels on Wednesday partly because of concerns about his security , his aide Tanaka Khloth said earlier on Thursday before the prince &apos;s departure . 
Sirivudh said Co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh and the royalist FUNCINPEC party supported his return to Cambodia . 
a half-brother of King Sihanouk and a former foreign minister , Sirivudh went into exile in December 1995 after being held for a month on charges of involvement in an alleged plot to kill Hun Sen. 
Hun Sen , who rules in an uneasy coalition with the FUNCINPEC party of Sirivudh &apos;s nephew Ranariddh , has refused to back calls for an amnesty and warned last week of violence if the prince returned . 
last December Hun Sen said he would shoot down any plane carrying Sirivudh . 
Sirivudh said in Hong Kong he did not think he would be killed when he arrived in Cambodia . 
we have a monarchy , we have a king , we have a national assembly , we have a royal government , &quot; he said .
