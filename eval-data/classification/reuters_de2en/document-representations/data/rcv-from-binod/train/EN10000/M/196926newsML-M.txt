spot physical electricity prices in the northeastern U.S. finished Monday flat from Friday amid light trading and more temperate weather after last week &apos;s cold snap . 
&quot; People are already looking to schedule next week for the holiday , &quot; said a New York trader , referring to the U.S. thanksgiving holiday on Thursday Nov 28 . 
the spell of relatively mild weather in the Northeast was expected to be short-lived . 
for Tuesday , temperatures in most of the Northeast were expected to peak in 30s-40s Fahrenheit and to bottom in the single digits to 20s . 
parts of Vermont , New York and New Hampshire were forecast to experience sub-zero degree temperatures in late night and early morning hours . 
extended outlook showed temperatures four to eight degrees below seasonal norms would prevail through the end of the week . 
light snow fell today in the some outer areas of western New York state . 
in the western part of the New York Power pool ( NYPP ) district , peak , non-firm electricity for Tuesday was quoted at $ 22.00- $ 24.00 a megawatt hour ( MWh ) , compared with Friday &apos;s $ 24.00 for Monday delivery . 
Western NYPP power for non-firm delivery during light load hours on Tuesday held steady $ 14.00 . 
in the eastern part of NYPP , peak , non-firm electricity for Tuesday was valued near $ 28.00- $ 29.00 , a tighter range than Friday &apos;s $ 27.00- $ 29.00 . 
off-peak , non-firm Tuesday electricity in eastern NYPP was notationally pegged at $ 17.00- $ 18.00 , also a narrower range than Friday &apos;s $ 15.00- $ 18.00 . 
in the New England Power pool ( NEPOOL ) peak , non-firm electricity for Tuesday at the Northeast Utilities border was bid as low as $ 29.00 and offered mostly around the $ 35.00 area , compared with Friday &apos;s notational assessement of $ 35.00- $ 36.00 . 
&quot; The bids and asks are still wide . 
it &apos;s hard to make deals , &quot; said one Northeast trader . 
the 619 megawatt ( MW ) oil-fired Wyman 4 generating unit in Yarmouth , Maine , was expected to resume operation Tuesday after being shut October 5 for seasonal maintenance . 
market sources said wholesale power trading was light due to participants attending an industry conference in New Orlean for the next couple of days .
