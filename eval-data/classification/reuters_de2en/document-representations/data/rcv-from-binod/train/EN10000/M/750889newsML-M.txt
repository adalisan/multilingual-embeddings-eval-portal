Robusta coffee futures look set to move higher after New York &apos;s recent rally but the expected strength might not be enough to combat a weak technical picture , analysts said on Wednesday . 
a strong performance in New York saw September arabica surge to an intra-day peak of 170.50 cents per lb , its highest level in over a week . 
local dealers said speculators and the trade had bought heavily on fears of a shortage of exchange-certified coffee for delivery against September . 
in London , traders called the market to open as much as $ 100 higher than Tuesday &apos;s close based on a theoretical calculation but said an open of between $ 50 and $ 60 higher was more realistic . 
but the technical picture in London still looked weak and prices bounced only slightly on Tuesday from an earlier slide to six-month lows to end with pared losses . 
&quot; We are now on a downward trend again and starting to move back to support in the February range , &quot; said Susan Rigg , a technical analyst at Chart Analysis . 
after September saw a sharp sell-off early last week , dragging out of its month-long sideways movement , it ralled briefly to $ 1,645 before resuming the slide . 
this point would now act as nearby resistance , Rigg said . 
&quot; We &apos;re going to have to move back at least to the rally high ( $ 1,645 ) and close above it to say we have a chance of going up , &quot; she said . 
&quot; I think it &apos;s more likely to move down ... I would say we &apos;re probably going to have a look at the lower levels . 
traders say robusta &apos;s flagging technical outlook coincides with a less constructive fundamental picture . 
weather forecasters see no prospects of a freeze through the end of July , traditionally the end of the frost season in Brazil .
