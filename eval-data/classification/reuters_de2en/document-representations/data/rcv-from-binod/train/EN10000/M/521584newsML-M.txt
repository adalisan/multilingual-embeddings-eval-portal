U.S. West Coast refined product prices were unchanged Thursday , taking their cue from a steady futures market rather than news of brief outages at Tosco &apos;s Rodeo refinery east of San Francisco , traders said . 
NYMEX crude oil for May delivery traded up and down before creeping up seven cents to $ 19.42 . 
&quot; The Merc ( New York Mercantile Exchange ) was off again most of the day , &quot; one trader said , who noted the bearish market offset Tosco &apos;s cut back in production late Wednesday . 
the plant operated normally late Thursday , although a Tosco spokesman declined to say if equipment ran full out . 
traders said Tosco bought spot cargoes early , but the company declined to say if down time in production would disrupt supplies to customers . 
Tosco earlier said the coking and hydrocracker Rodeo , a 104,000 barrel per day facility , cut back to minimal levels after a gas leak hit a desulphurization unit . 
traders pegged CARB cleaner-burning gasoline between 71 and 72 cents a gallon in Los Angeles while CARB-grade low sulphur diesel stood at yesterday &apos;s levels of 72 and 73 cents .
