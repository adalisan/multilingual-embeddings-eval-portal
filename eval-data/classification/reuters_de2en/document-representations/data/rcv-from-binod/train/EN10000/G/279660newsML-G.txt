bitter cold killed a homeless man in Leipzig on Sunday and ice halted shipping on major waterways . 
police said an unidentified man in his 50s was found frozen to death in an abandoned Leipzig building . 
he was believed to be the first fatality of the year-end cold snap that has brought temperatures down to minus 20 degrees Celsius in some parts of Germany . 
the shipping authorities in Magdeburg said more than 200 km ( 120 miles ) of the River Elbe would be closed at midnight on Sunday from its confluence with the Saale down to Doemitz near Dannenberg . 
the federal agency for shipping in Hamburg said conditions are expected to worsen in the next few days . 
ice is already five to 10 cm ( two to four inches ) thick on much of the North Sea and the Baltic coasts . 
sections of the Danube and Main rivers in the southern state of Bavaria were also frozen over and shipping authorities in Munich ordered vessels to proceed to the nearest harbour . 
the Main-Danube canal was frozen solid , the authorities said . 
the Elbe-Havel canal in northern German was closed on Saturday and the Mittellandkanal was closed on Sunday . 
the spokesman for the shipping authority said that traffic on the Elbe had already been sharply curtail last week as ice began forming on the river . 
the river carried only about 10 percent of the normal traffic volume last week , he said . 
the Elbe was closed last winter for about a month because of ice .
