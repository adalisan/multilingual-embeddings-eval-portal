Italy , which this week airlifted 35 people from the southern Albanian port of Vlore , said on Thursday it was drawing up contingency plans to evacuate its citizens from Tirana and other parts of the Balkan state . 
defence Minister Beniamino Andreatta told a parliamentary commission that plans for a new rescue mission were being drawn up &quot; should this become necessary in the wake of a general state of disorder endangering the safety of our compatriots &quot; . 
&quot; In any situation where Italian citizens are in danger , our armed forces are obliged to intervene , &quot; Andreatta told the defence commission of the Chamber of Deputies ( lower house ) . 
U.S. military commanders in Germany said they were also drawing up plans to evacuate more than 1,600 Americans resident in Albania , where rebels have seized towns in the south and army forces have advanced to try to quell the insurrection . 
Albanian President Sali Berisha , backed by opposition parties , agreed on Thursday to suspend military activity against rebels in the south and to offer an amnesty to insurgents who surrendered their weapons within two days . 
soldiers fought insurgents east of the Adriatic port of Sarande on Wednesday in the first major clash since Albania declared a state of emergency to contain widespread rioting sparked by the collapse of dubious get-rich-quick schemes . 
Andreatta said there was no need to send troops to southern Italy , where authorities have stepped up patrols in case of a wave of immigrants trying to make the 40-mile Adriatic crossing . 
coastguards and finance police said they had intercepted a boat carrying 29 Albanians -- 10 men , 10 women and nine children -- on Wednesday night as it was beginning to sink . 
a Carabinieri spokesman in the town of Otranto said one of the group , 43-year-old Besnik Nuhaj , had been arrested on charges of bringing illegal immigrants to Italy for money . 
a finance police spokesman said some of the group , who were all believed to be related , had sought political asylum and officials were still deliberating whether to repatriate them . 
in a change from the usual poverty-stricken immigrants crossing illegally from Albania , the spokesman said the group told officials they had bought the boat with their own savings . 
the finance police spokesman said another group of immigrants , believed to be some 20 Albanians , landed in two dinghies near Lecce on Thursday , escaping capture but leaving behind a sack containing some 12 kg ( 26 lbs ) of marijuana . 
he had no further details and officials were unable to confirm another report that five other suspected Albanian immigrants had been arrested near the port of Bari . 
Italy , which briefly occupied Albania during World War Two , has proved a magnet in recent years for illegal immigrants seeking to flee Europe &apos;s poorest state . 
tens of thousands of Albanians made a mass exodus to Italy in 1991 after 45 years of Stalinist rule crumbled . 
Italian officials say there are nearly 64,000 Albanians legally resident but more than 200,000 could be in Italy illegally . 
Italy threw out almost 13,000 Albanians last year and some 900 have been stopped trying to enter this year . 
earlier this week , two Albanian pilots flew their MIG-15 into Italy and asked for political asylum .
