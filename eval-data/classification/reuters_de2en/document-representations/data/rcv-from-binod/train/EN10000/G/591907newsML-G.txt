South Korean state prosecutors probing President Kim Young-sam &apos;s son on suspicion of corruption said they indicted two of his business associates on fraud , bribery and other charges on Friday . 
park Tae-joong and Kim Hi-chan were arrested this month after prosecutors accused them of taking bribes in return for promises to lobby Kim Hyun-chul , the president &apos;s second son , for help in obtaining government broadcast licences . 
prosecutors grilled Kim Hyun-chul , dubbed the &quot; crown prince &quot; , for a second straight day on Friday and said they would seek his arrest within 24 hours . 
senior prosecutor Shim Je-ryoon told reporters that investigators had said that the president &apos;s son accepted 2.5 billion won ( $ 2.8 million ) from another business associate Lee Song-ho , who is also under investigation . 
Lee , the former president of Dae Ho Construction Co , handed over the cash to Kim Hyun-chul on five occasions in boxes , Shim said .
