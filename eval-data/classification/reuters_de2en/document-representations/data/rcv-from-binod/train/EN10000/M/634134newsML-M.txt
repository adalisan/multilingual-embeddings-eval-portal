CBOT soybeans ended mixed Tuesday , with July soybeans under pressure from ideas that current prices favor South American soybean imports to the U.S. , traders and analysts said . 
&quot; The explanation for the sell-off in July is the continued concern about imports coming from Brazil , &quot; said Anne Frick , oilseeds analyst with prudential Securities . 
recent soybean values in Brazil are at a sharp discount to those in the U.S. , so U.S. soybean processors are said to be eyeing South America as a less expensive source for soybeans , traders and analysts said . 
however , Frick said the &quot; window of opportunity for import ( of South American product ) would not stay open much longer . 
nearby contracts also came under pressure from weakness in soybean cash markets . 
several commercial firms began quoting bids basis CBOT August or November futures instead of July . 
the switch meant that cash soybean prices in some markets were as much as three to 14 cents per bushel lower Tuesday than if prices had been quoted basis July , cash sources said . 
CBOT soybeans settled 15-1 / 4 cents per bushel lower to one cent higher , with July down 15-1 / 4 at $ 8.60 . 
deferred soybean contracts were supported by forecasts for continued cool weather in much of the Midwest for the near term . 
the National weather Service latest six- to 10-day outlook showed below-normal temperatures for much of the Midwest . 
&quot; Wet , cool soils continue to hamper growth of soybeans and corn throughout the state , &quot; said a newsletter issued by state extension agents in Ohio on Monday . 
on the day , Refco sold two million bushels July , Rosenthal Collins sold one million July and ADM sold one million November , floor sources said . 
Merrill Lynch bought 2.5 million July , Cargill bought one million July and FIMAT bought 1.5 million November , traders said . 
in options trading , FIMAT bought 2,000 July $ 8.25 puts and Smith Barney bought 1,000 July $ 8.25 puts , pit sources said . 
that figure compared with Monday &apos;s actual volume of 65,865 .
