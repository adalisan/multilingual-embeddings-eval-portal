Switzerland &apos;s final 1996 trade surplus rose to 2.21 billion Swiss francs from 1.24 billion in 1995 , the Federal Customs Office said . 
balance ( million Sfr ) 2,206.6 1,236.5 
imports ( million Sfr ) 91,967.3 90,775.5 
exports ( million Sfr ) 94,173.9 92,012.0 
note - Figures exclude precious metals and stones , art objects and antiques . 
the final surplus was bigger than the preliminary total of 1.696.8 million francs reported on January 21 . 
including precious metals and stones , art objects and antiques , the final 1996 trade figures were : 
balance ( million Sfr ) 1,924.8 1,753.1 
imports ( million Sfr ) 96,664.0 94,483.3 
exports ( million Sfr ) 98,588.8 96,236.4 
this was revised from the preliminary 1,417.8 million franc surplus originally reported . 
it was Switzerland &apos;s fourth consecutive year with a trade surplus . 
&quot; In all , cross-border trade in both directions was clearly less dynamic than in the previous year , &quot; the customs office said . 
&quot; While imports suffered because of the weak domestic economy , the faltering economic upswing in western European industrial countries could not lend a decisive boost to Swiss exports , &quot; it added . 
the Swiss franc &apos;s strength also weighed on exports , it said . 
the import rise primarily reflected more energy supplies and consumer goods , while consumer and durable goods led the increase in exports . 
imports rose significantly from OPEC countries , the United States and China , but fell from Japan , eastern Europe and key countries in Latin America and southeast Asia , it said . 
non-European OECD countries , eastern Europe , Turkey and selected countries in South America and southeast Asia attracted more exports , while sales to the European Union stagnated . 
average import prices slipped slightly from those in 1995 , while export prices rose minimally . 
this led to a slight improvement in terms of trade .
