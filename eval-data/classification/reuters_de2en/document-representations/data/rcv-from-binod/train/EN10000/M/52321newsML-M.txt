Bunds will stay top of the class in the months ahead for investors comparing relative merits of the world &apos;s big three bond markets , analysts said on Friday . 
&quot; European outperformance is nowhere more evident than in the 10-year German-U.S. spread which we see widening to right through 100 basis points in the next two to three months , &quot; said David Brown at Bear Stearns International in London . 
Brown , chief European economist , recommended investors go overweight Bunds versus U.S. or Japanese government bonds because of the rosy outlook for German fundamentals . 
he said they should be neutral to slightly underweight treasuries , because of the &quot; strong possibility &quot; of a quarter point rise in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve on September 24 , and very underweight JGBs . 
&quot; There is a very good chance we will see six percent taken out on the 10-year Bund yields over the next couple of months and a 50-50 chance of them trading down to 5.75 percent before the year-end , &quot; Brown said . 
Steve Barrow , international economist at Chase in London , said he preferred markets outside the big three , but forced to choose would favour Germany , Japan and the U.S. in that order . 
he expected a 25 basis point U.S. rate rise on September 24 , and advised avoiding the short end for that reason . 
he foresaw further outperformance by Bunds against treasuries in spread terms and no real risk , probably even in the longer term , that the Bundesbank would need to follow the Fed in tightening monetary policy . 
Brown said the current gross yields of 6.25 percent on 10-year Bunds and 6.87 percent on treasuries left a big gulf with the comparable Japanese yield of only 2.91 percent . 
positive factors for Bunds listed by Brown were stagnant German economic growth compared with the U.S. , lower inflation and interest rates heading down instead of up . 
he said that as the Japanese economy picked up and the threat of a big budget deficit loomed , the only real attraction of investing in JGBs would be a rising yen . 
but he saw a risk the dollar / yen exchange rate would move to 115 from 110 in the next three to six months . 
Barrow said that the least unfavourable places to invest among the big three were 10 to 30 years for the U.S. , the four to five year area for Japan , and one-year for Germany . 
Kim Thomsen , head of fixed income at Danske Invest in Copenhagen , Denmark &apos;s largest investment fund , said he found the U.S. market more enticing than Japan or Germany over the next one to two months . 
he said he would not go overweight yet on U.S. treasuries but was on the lookout for good buying opportunities once there were expected signs of a second half slowdown . 
he said that unless there were strong figures from economic indicators in the meantime , he did not think the Fed would raise interest rates on September 24 but would prefer to stay on the sidelines till November . 
Thomsen said there was growing evidence that the Atlanta Olympics had a greater impact on the economy than previously thought , opening the way to a big contraction when that temporary stimulus ended . 
he said he believed the October U.S. non-farm payrolls data would provide the first clear evidence of this . 
Thomsen said the T-note / Bund spread could widen a little short-term , but narrow after the U.S. turnaround to between 35 to 50 basis points in October / November . 
he saw a big risks in JGBs , with a possibility that big institutions would stop investing in the market again in view of threat of tightened monetary policy to curb growth .
