economic data due to be released this morning , traders said . 
* They said trading of the Canada dollar would pick up with the release of U.S. non-farm payrolls for the month of July at 0830 EDT / 1230 GMT . 
&quot; Basically , everybody is waiting for the numbers to give us some direction , &quot; said one trader at a large Canadian bank . 
barring the release of inflationary U.S. data , analysts said they expected the Canadian dollar to continue trading in a healthier range . 
the Canadian dollar broke out of weakness above the C $ 1.3810 ( US $ 0.7241 ) level this week on the back of heavy buying of Canadian dollars out of the United States . 
&quot; sporadic heavy buyers of the Canada ( dollar ) are slowly beating back the Canada ( dollar ) sellers , but the interest to sell Canada feels steadier , &quot; the trader said . 
but some analysts said a market-friendly payrolls figure could pave the way for a move by the Canadian dollar to C $ 1.3750 ( US $ 0.7272 ) . 
&quot; A good number would extend the period the U.S. Federal Reserve could stay on hold , and that would reduce the need for an imminent rate hike by the Bank of Canada , &quot; Angastiniotis said . 
on the crosses , the Canada dollar rose to 86.31 Japanese yen from 86.05 yen on Friday and climbed to 1.3431 marks from Friday &apos;s 1.3336 marks .
