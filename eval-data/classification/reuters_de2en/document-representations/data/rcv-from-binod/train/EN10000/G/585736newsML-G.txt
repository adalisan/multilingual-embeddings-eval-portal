South African President Nelson Mandela redoubled his bid for peace in Zaire on Thursday and a rebel spokesman warned that Laurent Kabila &apos;s fighters would give President Mobutu Sese Seko until Saturday to quit the capital . 
presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said Mandela was making calls and having meetings in Cape Town as he waited for Kabila , who on Wednesday backed out of a meeting with Mobutu , to arrive in the city for follow-up talks . 
&quot; The humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Zaire is unprecedented . 
there is no amount of patience he ( Mandela ) cannot find . 
he is compelled to continue , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We think there is still a very large opening for them both to walk through to achieve peace in Zaire , &quot; he said . 
Mandela failed on Wednesday to broker a final face-to-face meeting between Mobutu and Kabila aboard a South African navy icebreaker in the Congolese port of Pointe noire . 
Kabila , citing security fears , kept Mandela and Mobutu waiting for several hours and then refused to fly to the ship . 
Mobutu , fighting cancer and the encircling grip of Kabila &apos;s rebel alliance , returned to Kinshasa on Thursday . 
witnesses said he spurned a red carpet farewell and honour guard laid on by the Congolese and boarded his plane by a rear entrance . 
in Kinshasa , the teeming capital of five million people where residents fear a rampage by Mobutu &apos;s ill-disciplined army as much as anything else , &quot; bloodbath &quot; was a word on many lips . 
&quot; We &apos;re heading directly for a bloodbath . 
it &apos;s a question of balance of forces . 
Kabila knows he has the upper hand , &quot; said Mobutu aide Kabuya Lumuna . 
&quot; confrontation is inevitable . 
we will have two or three bad days from now on , &quot; opposition politician Mukendi Wa Mulumba said . 
a member of the Organisation of African Unity delegation in Pointe noire told reporters the OAU was very pessimistic about prospects for a negotiated peace following the cancellation of the second meeting between Mobutu and Kabila . 
but South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki told reporters in Pointe noire : &quot; The talks are not on the verge of any collapse . 
there was a hiccup yesterday because the alliance raised questions about security . 
he said South Africa would discuss the rebel warning to Mobutu with Kabila in Cape Town on Thursday and would send a delegation to Kinshasa in coming days . 
South Africa would convene a meeting of regional leaders soon , Mbeki added . 
Mankahlana said Mandela was trying to get Mobutu , who has ruled Zaire for 32 years , and Kabila to ratify a two-page South African proposal to end Zaire &apos;s civil war and ensure a peaceful transition to democratic rule . 
the proposal was hammered out by Mandela and Mbeki , who left Pointe noire on Thursday after talks with Mobutu &apos;s delegation . 
he apparently did not meet Mobutu . 
in Lisbon , the LUSA news agency quoted rebel Justice &quot; Commissioner-General &quot; Mwenze Kongolo as saying that only Mobutu &apos;s surrender would ensure a peaceful end to the seven-month conflict which has carried rebel forces to within striking distance of Kinshasa . 
if no deal were done , rebel forces would enter Kinshasa and Mobutu would risk capture &quot; if he insists on remaining in power until Saturday &quot; , the agency quoted Kongolo as saying . 
&quot; The only way out of the crisis is for Mobutu to hand over power to the armed rebellion which will form a transitional government together with other forces fighting for the same cause , &quot; Kongolo told LUSA . 
he said the transition should last at least two years . 
South African government sources and Western diplomats said bickering over the balance of power in the proposed transitional authority was one of the issues delaying a settlement . 
the South African Broadcasting Corporation , quoting a leaked copy of Mandela &apos;s proposal , said the 10-point plan would require Mobutu to step down within 24 hours of signing a settlement . 
&quot; He will play no future role in government structures , but his safety and that of his family will be guaranteed . 
he will also be given the courtesy and dignity usually afforded to a former head of state , &quot; the radio said . 
the European Parliament on Thursday urged Mobutu and Kabila to form an interim government to organise democratic elections and avert a bloody conflict . 
France said its troops in Congo remained on alert , but had no immediate plans to evacuate foreigners from Kinshasa .
