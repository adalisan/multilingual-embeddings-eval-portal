stocks closed slightly higher on Thursday , but for the second straight session , a sharp run-up evaporated as the market again consolidated its steep , summer-long rally . 
the Dow Jones industrial average ended up 13.71 points at 7,942.03 . 
the blue-chip index has soared nearly 880 points so far this summer on the back of moderate economic growth and subdued inflation . 
in the broader market , advancing issues led declines 1,516 to 1,258 on heavy volume of 530 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
stocks got some support for the bond market , which rallied after the government reported the Consumer Price Index rose a mere 0.2 percent in July , in line with forecasts . 
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up nearly a full point , which lowered its yield to 6.55 percent from Wednesday &apos;s close of 6.63 percent . 
despite the retreat in bond interest rates from a recent peak of 6.70 percent , the stock market still felt that the long-bond yield was still high . 
the rate is one-quarter point higher than the 6.33 percent on July 30 , when the Dow stood at a then record 8,254.89 . 
analysts said investors clearly remained on edge , selling stocks into any market strength as rates remained well higher than a week ago . 
&quot; There were great expectations built into the ( stock ) market then , &quot; said Dick Stein , vice president at U.S. Clearing Corp. &quot; Just last week , people were talking about interest rates going to 6 percent . 
stocks mirrored Wednesday &apos;s pattern , as the market burst higher at the open in relief over tame inflation data , only to sharply reverse course later in the session . 
with their interest rate wish list evidently on hold , investors displayed an edgy willingness to sell into any market strength , analysts said , and stocks continued to work through a choppy consolidation . 
&quot; This is the kind of consolidation that has to go on after a significant run-up , &quot; said Scott Bleier , chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd . &quot; We went through a long period where there were just no down days . 
&quot; With rates at 6.50 percent or below , valuations had some room to grow , &quot; he said , &quot; but above 6.50 and they start to look a little stretched .
