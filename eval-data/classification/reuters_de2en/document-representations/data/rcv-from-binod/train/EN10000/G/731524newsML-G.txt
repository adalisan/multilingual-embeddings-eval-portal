French Open champion Iva Majoli said on Wednesday her goal was to be second in the world by the end of the season . 
the 19-year-old Croat is currently ranked fourth by the Women &apos;s Tennis Association ( WTA ) and is second in the year &apos;s earnings list , after Wimbledon champion Martina Hingis . 
&quot; I am fourth now and my goal is to climb to second place , as close as possible to Martina Hingis , &quot; Majoli said in an interview in the Globus weekly on Wednesday . 
&quot; Last year I used only half of my capacity during training . 
now I approach every training with 100 per cent force and concentration , &quot; she said . 
a right-handed and energetic player who prefers to stay at the baseline , Majoli won her first Grand Slam title at Roland Garros by beating 16-year-old Swiss Hingis in the final . 
their head-to-head tally now stands at 2-2 . 
the audience wants rivalry , like the one between Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert-Lloyd , or Steffi Graf and Monica Seles , &quot; Majoli told the weekly .
