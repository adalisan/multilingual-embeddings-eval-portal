Boris Nemtsov , Russia &apos;s new first deputy prime minister , on Saturday grilled red-faced officials on the way they award government contracts , as a salvo in the battle against corruption announced by the Kremlin this week . 
Nemtsov even questioned the way the government contracted for massive repairs on its own White House headquarters , badly damaged after the Kremlin used tanks on it to quash an armed uprising in 1993 . 
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the main building in the country was repaired without a competition . 
I don &apos;t understand , &quot; Nemtsov said in a rare session at which Russian government bureaucrats were challenged publicly and forcefully on their activities . 
government officials responded that an open tender for the contract had not been held because the government had been &quot; in a hurry &quot; . 
thousands of Turkish workers rapidly repaired the building in an estimated $ 85 million job . 
Nemtsov &apos;s meeting on Saturday followed a decree and a speech by President Boris Yeltsin this week in which he vowed to stamp out the corruption that has flourished across Russia since the fall of communism in 1991 . 
Yeltsin said his latest attempt to grapple with the age-old problem would open up the system of tendering for state contracts to reduce bureaucrats &apos; temptation to take bribes . 
it will become scary to steal and take bribes , &quot; the president said . 
chairing a special meeting at the White House called to examine how government ministries awarded state contracts , Nemtsov brushed aside bureaucrats &apos; excuses for their failure to conduct open tenders . 
a official from the Defence Ministry &apos;s Voyentorg chain of stores appeared stunned as Nemtsov , seated on a podium above him in front of an auditorium , demanded answers . 
&quot; Why are your prices 50 percent higher than in regular stores ? 
&quot; Nemtsov asked . 
&quot; We have a problem , &quot; the official meekly responded . 
&quot; We don &apos;t have this problem -- there is a problem with the organisation of your work , &quot; Nemtsov said , promising to target Voyentorg for reform . 
senior officials from the defence , transport and construction ministries said a lack of budget funding and monopoly suppliers contributed to the existing system of sweetheart deals . 
but Nemtsov , a young liberal recently appointed to the government to help jumpstart stalled political and economic reform , did not appear sympathetic . 
&quot; Procurements will no longer be carried out through this ordering system , &quot; he told officials who were unable to say how many of their supplies were obtained through open competition . 
&quot; Unfortunately , it &apos;s not uncommon that competitions are formally carried out but in fact they often already know who &apos;s going to win . 
that won &apos;t do , &quot; Nemtsov said . 
Nemtsov said open tender competitions for state contracts , as well as tender results and any violations , would have to be published in the national and regional press . 
in a Russian public television interview aired on Saturday evening , Nemtsov said bureaucrats wold be required to declare their incomes as well as their and close relatives &apos; property and global bank holdings .
