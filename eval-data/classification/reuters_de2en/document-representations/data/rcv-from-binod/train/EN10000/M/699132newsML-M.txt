fundamentals were seen driving up foreign crude prices in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday , keeping most buyers on the sidelines , traders said . 
&quot; Domestic grades are getting expensive , the North Sea is tight .... things seem to have bottomed out for the time being , &quot; said one crude seller . 
&quot; The market looks pretty constructive for the next couple of weeks . 
the supply-demand balance was tightening for both ends of the crude spectrum , traders said . 
the tight North Sea market and a narrow spread between West Texas Intermediate / Cushing and Brent were boosting regional and domestic sweet grades . 
the August WTI / Brent spread was around $ 1.25-30 a barrel on Tuesday afternoon . 
meanwhile , sour grades were moving up in response to the delay in the resumption of Iraqi crude exports under the U.N. oil-for-food deal . 
Iraqi Kirkuk and Basrah grades were not expected to re-enter the market until late July or early August at the earliest . 
from the North Sea , a Norwegian company was showing Brent for around 20-25 cents a barrel under WTI for first-half August delivery . 
the same seller was also offering Oseberg at around the same price for end-July arrival . 
West African availabilities were more plentiful . 
a U.S. company was close to selling 450,000 barrels of Nigerian qua Iboe for $ 1.93 a barrel over dated Brent for first-half August delivery . 
a U.S. company was still looking for a home for 950,000 barrels of qua Iboe for end-July , asking the CIF equivalent of around 40 cents a barrel over dated Brent fob . 
a trading house was showing Forcados for August 10-20 at dated Brent plus $ 1.75 a barrel , a price buyers deemed very aggressive . 
a European company was also heard offering a waterborne cargo of Odudu , although this could not be immediately confirmed . 
in Latin America , a top Argentine producer was showing one million barrels of Canadon Seco crude for loading in the second half of August . 
elsewhere in the Southern Cone , Chile and Uruguay were seeking to buy around one million barrels of crude apiece for August delivery in separate crude tenders , traders said . 
Chile &apos;s state oil company Empresa Nacional del Petroleo ( ENAP ) was seeking to buy 960,000 barrels of crude oil for August 14-18 delivery . 
bids will be received and the tender awarded on Wednesday . 
Uruguay &apos;s state oil refiner ANCAP was seeking to buy one million barrels of crude for August 18-28 delivery . 
the Uruguayan tender will be awarded late on July 3 .
