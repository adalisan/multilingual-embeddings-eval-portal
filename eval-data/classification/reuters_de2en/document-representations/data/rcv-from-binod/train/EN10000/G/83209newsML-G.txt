Chile &apos;s President Eduardo Frei swore in on Saturday new top political adviser Juan Villarzu and four other new cabinet ministers in a reshuffle to spruce up the government &apos;s image before municipal elections next month . 
in a ceremony at the presidential palace , Frei swore in Villarzu , who replaced outgoing Chief-of-Staff Genaro Arriagada , and new ministers of education , agriculture , planning and transport and communication . 
the new ministers , most of whom are economists , have been appointed to give fresh impetus to high-profile social and economic programmes before the elections on October 27 which will be a key political test for Frei &apos;s centre-left coalition . 
&quot; The advances which have been achieved so far are undeniable , &quot; said Frei . 
but the government , which came to power in 1994 , needs to concentrate on boosting its own efficiency and improving the quality of political and legislative programmes , said Frei . 
right-wing opposition politicians attacked the reshuffle , saying it highlighted the government &apos;s poor management of its education and modernisation projects . 
&quot; The change of cabinet confirms our view that the government had been working in an extremely deficient way , &quot; said Jovino Novoa , president of the opposition UDI party . 
the most surprising appointment was that of Villarzu , former head of state copper company Codelco , although Arriagada &apos;s replacement had been widely expected . 
Arriagada , a close confidant of Frei , had come under fire for political slip-ups including the defeat in Congress of constitutional reforms designed at curbing the power of the armed forces . 
Jose Pablo Arellano , former budget director , was sworn in as education minister to succeed Sergio Molina . 
Carlos Mlandinic , former chief trade negotiator , replaced Emiliano Ortega as agricultural minister and Transport and communications Minister Narciso Irureta was replaced by his own number two , Transport Secretary Claudio Hohmann . 
the cabinet reshuffle was the second in Frei &apos;s 30-month old government , after a shake-up of key political ministers in 1994 .
