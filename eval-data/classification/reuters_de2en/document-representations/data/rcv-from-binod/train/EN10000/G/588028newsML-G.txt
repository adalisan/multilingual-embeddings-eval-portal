Australian Defence Minister Ian McLachlan , pushing his tougher defence policy , on Thursday warned against an overly defensive strategy and said Australia must keep pace with the regional arms build-up . 
McLachlan said Canberra had to step up its defence efforts , including boosting its fighting ability and strengthening diplomatic measures to safeguard peace and stability . 
&quot; We do not accept that Australia &apos;s security begins only at our shoreline , &quot; he told a defence conference in Canberra . 
&quot; The government rejects the defeatist , indeed , isolationist , approach , which would have us adopt a &apos; fortress Australia &apos; mentality . 
&quot; The ability to operate beyond our shoreline , if necessary , is an essential objective for our national defence policy , &quot; he said . 
Australia &apos;s conservative Liberal-National government has taken a more hawkish stand on defence since ousting the 13-year-old Labor administration in March 1996 . 
it has shielded the A $ 10.4 billion ( US $ 8 billion ) defence budget from across-the-board spending cuts , refocused the money on combat ability and weapons and expressed a stronger readiness to fight overseas if necessary . 
Labor had concentrated largely on protecting the country &apos;s vast coastline and air and sea approaches . 
the new government stresses there is no immediate threat and denies it is shifting towards a policy of forward defence , but says Australian forces must be prepared for all future problems . 
McLachlan said the military , the most advanced in Southeast Asia , had to keep pace with the growing might of its Asian neighbours who are building up their forces on the back of runaway economic growth . 
&quot; For we need to keep pace or else we will consign ourselves to strategic irrelevance , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We are kidding ourselves if we complacently assume that we can keep up without making a greater effort now and in the future . 
&quot; Until recently , Australians have tended to take for granted that our defence forces would enjoy a &apos; technological edge &apos; over other defence forces in our region . 
that is no longer possible in all areas . 
McLachlan said Canberra also had to boost co-operation with neighbouring countries and foster healthy alliances as part of a broad defence strategy .
