Hong Kong stocks advanced modestly in early Friday morning trade , but investors appeared ready to consolidate recent gains in advance of the weekend and following a record-breaking week , brokers said . 
&quot; I believe we are going to test the 13,000 level but not today , &quot; said Kenneth Poon in Hong Kong equities trading at Lehman Brothers . 
the Hang Seng Index added 40 points in the first half hour to trend at the 12,775 level on robust turnover of HK $ 1.54 billion . 
early trade , which saw the index trending weaker , was broadly based in new issues , takeover targets and blue chips . 
China Resources Beijing Land and Hongkong Arts Optical were active on their trading debut . 
the Hang Seng Index set new record closing or intraday highs throughout the week , prompted in part by new records set by both the Dow industrials and the S &amp; P 500 . 
fundamentally , analysts see the market as nearly fully valued , but still see some short-term upside . 
&quot; As long as the U.S. long-bond yield stays below 7.0 percent , there is a strong likelihood that Hong Kong will break through to 13,500 by yearend , &quot; said Alex Ho , executive research director at UBS Securities ( East Asia ) . 
&quot; That puts the index on 14 times prospective 1997 earnings , &quot; Ho added . 
one broker at a U.S. investment house said hedge funds were a major factor in the market &apos;s heavy turnover . 
but he warned these funds could switch some funds to other Asian markets , such as Thailand , which have underperformed compared to Hong Kong . 
the November Hang Seng Index futures contract was trading up 40 points at 12,775 , a 35-point premium to the cash market . 
both the December and March contracts were trading at higher premiums but on very low volume . 
the utility sector led the market , followed by modest advances in other sectors . 
properties were the exception , trending in negative territory in early trade . 
the company reported earnings growth of 21.9 percent for the year 1995 / 96 , slightly below brokers &apos;s expectations .
