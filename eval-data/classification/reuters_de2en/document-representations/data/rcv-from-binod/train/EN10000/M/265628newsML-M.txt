the key September three-month Euroyen futures contract ended Wednesday &apos;s TIFFE day session lower in sympathy with Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures &apos; weakness . 
the September closed down 0.02 at 99.25 , after trading between 99.23 and 99.27 . 
Position-adjustment ahead of the BOJ governor &apos;s press conference also pushed prices lower , a city bank trader said . 
Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) Governor Yasuo Matsushita said Japan &apos;s economic recovery was starting to gain firmness and that monetary policy will emphasise securing the basis for recovery . 
his remarks came out shortly after the day session ended . 
&quot; Today &apos;s activities were limited to position adjustment . 
the volume was very thin , &quot; another city bank trader said . 
volume for the September contract was 28,889 , down from 42,464 on Tuesday . 
&quot; Foreign bank players are likely to be gone by next week . 
the volume is likely to become even thinner in coming days , &quot; the first trader said . 
in the Euro interbank market , Japanese banks &apos; fund-raising costs remained higher on Wednesday , money traders said . 
the one-month Eurodollar deposit rate at major Japanese city banks was near six percent , compared with the prevailing rate of 5.59375 percent . 
money traders said the higher cost was largely due to seasonal fund demand , with foreign banks &apos; reluctance to lend money ahead of the end-year book closing also adding to fund shortages . 
&quot; Once the year-end fund demand eases , the rate is likely to fall , &quot; a money trader at a city bank said . 
key unsecured overnight call money was traded at 0.49 percent , up from 0.48 percent on Tuesday . 
the BOJ injected a net 100 billion yen into the money market in the morning , maintaining a neutral stance . 
about 90 billion yen worth of three-month certificates of deposit ( CDs ) were issued at 0.51 percent , up from 0.50 percent on Tuesday . 
about 130 billion yen worth of one-month CDs and about 90 billion yen worth of two-month CDs were also issued at 0.51 percent , up from 0.50 percent on the previous day .
