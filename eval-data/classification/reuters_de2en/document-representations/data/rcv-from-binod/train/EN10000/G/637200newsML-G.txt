Richard Holbrooke , who negotiated a Bosnia peace agreement , was appointed as special U.S. emissary for Cyprus on Wednesday to help promote a political settlement for the divided Mediterranean island . 
&quot; President Clinton has named Ambassador Richard Holbrooke as the new U.S. special presidential emissary on Cyprus , &quot; State Department spokesman Nichola Burns told reporters . 
Holbrooke will replace Richard Beattie , who was named last month by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright as her adviser on incorporating three foreign affairs agencies into the State Department . 
&quot; This appointment of one of our most capable negotiators demonstrates our commitment to help promote a final political settlement on Cyprus , &quot; Burns said . 
he said the appointment represented &quot; a rebirth and a renewal &quot; of the U.S. mediation effort between the Greek and Turkish communities , physically divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion . 
but Burns added the United States did not have any illusions about achieving a quick breakthrough and said it was an extremely tough problem to crack . 
&quot; That is why we are bringing in our toughest negotiator , &quot; he said . 
burns noted that President Glafkos Clerides of Cyprus and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash were due to meet in July in New York and said Washington strongly urged all parties to work for a comprehensive , permanent settlement on the island .
