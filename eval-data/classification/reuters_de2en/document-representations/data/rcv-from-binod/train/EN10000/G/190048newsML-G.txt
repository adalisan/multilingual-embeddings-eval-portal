France said on Thursday it hoped the first troops of a multinational force to help refugees in Zaire would be in place by the weekend and said French soldiers would secure the airport around the eastern town of Bukavu . 
Paris also urged all U.N. member states to provide either soldiers or cash for the mission and said it wanted American , European and African deputy commanders alongside a Canadian general leading the planned force of several thousand troops . 
&quot; I hope that by the weekend we &apos;ll see the first soldiers on the ground , &quot; French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette told Europe 1 radio . 
Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said later that &quot; France will contribute to ensuring the safety of the platform at Bukavu . 
&quot; Bukavu , near the Rwandan border , has one of the main airports in eastern Zaire as a key staging post for the mission . 
the United States agreed in principle on Wednesday to take part . 
U.S. forces intend to secure the airfield in Goma , further north , as well as a three-mile ( 4.8 km ) corridor to the Rwandan border in a bid to encourage the refugees to go home . 
France , which has led calls for an international mission to help 1.2 million refugees from Rwanda and Burundi uprooted by fighting between Zaire and Tutsi rebels , has said it is ready to send about 1,500 soldiers , including 600 paratroopers within 24 hours of U.N. approval . 
de Charette met U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy , both in Paris for a peace meeting on Bosnia on Thursday , and noted a &quot; broad convergence of views &quot; on Zaire , Doutriaux said . 
he said France wanted any U.N. Security Council resolution authorising the force to stress the over-riding humanitarian goals of the mission to ensure food , water and medicines reach Hutu refugees fleeing the fighting in eastern Zaire . 
France also wanted the resolution to mention that voluntary contributions to the force should either be military or &quot; a contribution to a special fund &quot; to finance the sending of troops from developing countries , such as in Africa , he said . 
the force is to be under the overall command of a Canadian general . 
&quot; We want the Canadian commander to have three deputies , one European , one American and one African , &quot; Doutriaux said . 
he said the Security Council resolution also should urge the staging of a peace conference in Africa &apos;s Great Lakes region to address underlying political problems . 
de Charette also stressed that the force &apos;s sole task should be to ensure aid gets to the refugees . 
he rejected suggestions that it should , for instance , help repatriate refugees or seek to control Tutsi rebels . 
Rwanda accuses France of being partisan after it sent 2,500 troops to Rwanda in 1994 to help stop Hutu-led genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus . 
Rwanda &apos;s government says the French operation helped Hutus escape to Zaire . 
de Charette , who has repeatedly denied a pro-Hutu bias , said &quot; terrible crimes &quot; had been committed in Rwanda in 1994 and that &quot; those who committed them must be lawfully tried .
