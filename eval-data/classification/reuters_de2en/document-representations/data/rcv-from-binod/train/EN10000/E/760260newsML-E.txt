the annual summer sales in the German retail sector began promisingly on Monday in good weather , the German retail association ( HDE ) said . 
HDE spokesman Thomas Werz said hundreds of keen bargain-hunters had lined up on pavements in front of major department stores in Munich , Berlin and Hanover ahead of the starts of the sales this morning . 
reductions of up to 70 percent attracted customers to snap up summer fashions , children &apos;s clothes and shoes , he added . 
the association forecast that this year &apos;s turnover growth could outperform the growth in turnover seen during the summer sale period in 1996 , when turnover was up six percent from the previous year . 
sales in Germany are traditionally regulated into two two-week sessions during the year , one in summer and one in winter . 
although recent recessions and changing retail practices have led to an increased number of special-offer goods at other times , retailers still concentrate their reductions in these two periods . 
HDE managing director Holger Wenzel at the weekend warned stores against pre-empting the sale period with early reductions . 
he said in the Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper that such action could be be illegal and damaging to the retail sector as a whole .
