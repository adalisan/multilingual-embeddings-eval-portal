South Africa &apos;s Public Works Department has identified 130,000 state-owned properties and a maintenance backlog of 8.8 billion rand in its first audit of state assets . 
public Works Minister Jeff Radebe told a news conference that compilation of a state property register was about to enter a second phase with a search for missing assets and for properties illegally registered in private names . 
&quot; To date , some 130,000 state-owned properties , such as farms , vacant land , houses , offices , military bases , schools and hospitals have been identified , &quot; Radebe said . 
he said the maintenance backlog was estimated at 8.8 billion rand including provision for value added tax . 
&quot; Immediate and drastic action is necessary to ensure that the state &apos;s valuable property portfolio , which includes some of the finest buildings of their type in the world , does not fall into an irreparable state of decay , &quot; he said . 
an official said the department was working on a 10-year programme to make up the maintenance backlog . 
Radebe said the government had identified a number of properties abroad , including homes and missions owned by the four nominally independent black homelands created under apartheid and subsequently dismantled . 
the government had decided to sell around 3,500 houses and apartment blocks that had become obsolete since the homelands , each of which sent large diplomatic staffs to Pretoria , were dismantled . 
Radebe said the Bophuthatswana homeland near Johannesburg had owned property in Paris , Rome , London and Lithuania .
