following is the full text of the April Report on Business ( Purchasing Managers &apos; Survey ) of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply ( CIPS ) : 
the manufacturing economy expanded for the eleventh consecutive month in April . 
the seasonally adjusted Purchasing Managers &apos; Index ( PMI a composite indicator designed to provide an overall view of manufacturing activity ) rose further above the 50.0 no-change level as companies continued to raise output to meet further improvements in order books . 
although the rate of growth of export orders again declined as a result of the sustained strength of the pound in April , any losses were largely offset by the continued buoyancy of demand for manufactured goods from domestic customers . 
the overall rate of growth of new orders remained strong as a result , albeit lower than that recorded in the latter half of last year before the appreciation in the value of sterling began to subdue demand for exports . 
order levels have now risen for eleven consecutive months . 
despite a substantial increase in output during the month , high sales levels depleted stocks of finished goods for the second month running . 
however , significant capacity pressures and the potential inflationary impact of supply shortages have yet to appear . 
suppliers &apos; delivery times , which tend to lengthen when demand outstrips supply , registered no overall change in April as companies encountered few problems meeting current orders within established lead-times . 
with spare capacity existing in many sectors , more purchasing managers succeeded in negotiating lower prices than faced price rises from suppliers . 
in addition , the persisting strength of the pound , although dampening export demand to a certain extent , continued to reduce the cost of imported goods . 
consequently , the average price paid for inputs by manufacturers registered the fourth largest monthly decline recorded by this survey to date and the eighteenth successive monthly fall . 
finally , growth of sales has tempted few firms to significantly increase the size of their workforces in recent months . 
restructuring to improve competitiveness remains commonplace and manufacturing employment expanded only slightly as a result in April . 
* The Purchasing Managers &apos; Index ( PMI ) is a composite indicator designed to provide an overall view of activity in the manufacturing economy and acts as a leading indicator for the whole economy . 
the indicator is derived from individual diffusion indices which measure changes in output , new orders , employment , suppliers &apos; delivery times and stocks of goods purchased . 
the seasonally adjusted index may be subject to revision as improved estimation of seasonal adjustments occur with each month &apos;s new data . 
manufacturing output continued to exhibit significant growth in April as firms again increased production to meet further growth in order books . 
producers of capital goods reported the largest rise ( for the third month running ) , followed by producers of consumer goods . 
the weakest growth was that of intermediate goods ( components ) , where the impact of the stronger pound has had the greatest impact in recent months . 
the seasonally adjusted New Orders Index registered a further significant rise in April , the eleventh consecutive monthly improvement . 
as in recent months , rising orders largely reflect growing demand from UK customers . 
growth of export orders , on the other hand , continued to weaken due to the strength of sterling ( the New Export Orders Index fell to 51.8 in April ) . 
the seasonally adjusted quantity of Purchases Index registered strong growth in April . 
purchasing activity has been stepped up in recent months to satisfy growing production requirements , but the rate of increase continues to run slightly behind that of output , reflecting the continued trend towards more efficient stock management for cost considerations . 
lower prices were widely reported by purchasing managers in April as the strength of the pound again reduced the cost of imported materials . 
furthermore , despite the continued strengthening of demand for inputs , many firms again reported the ability to negotiate lower prices due to the existence of spare capacity at suppliers . 
the Prices Index signalled a sharp fall of equal magnitude to that seen in March . 
the seasonally adjusted Suppliers &apos; Delivery Times Index signalled no significant change in lead-times in April . 
although capacity constraints persisted in certain sectors , shortages remained relatively isolated on the whole with suppliers generally able to meet current order levels without incurring significant delays . 
stocks of goods purchased by manufacturers fell again in April , reflecting ongoing cost reduction policies intended to keep stocks as low as possible . 
however , the fall was the smallest recorded since March last year reflecting a slight rise in the number of firms , encouraged by low prices , reported to have been rebuilding stock holdings to meet anticipated growth of demand . 
stocks of finished goods fell in April but to a lesser extent than in any month since last May . 
for the second month running , the most commonly cited reason for the decline was sales growth exceeding current rates of production ( rather than depletion through deliberate stock reduction policies , as seen throughout last year ) . 
the rise in the index reflected an increased incidence of stock-building to meet demand . 
employment rose in April , but only modestly . 
with the exception of the production of investment ( capital ) goods , in which employment rose to meet stronger demand , firms remained wary of recruiting additional staff due to the need to reduce costs and improve competitiveness . 
this was most evident in the production of components , where employment fell . 
purchasing managers reported a further expansion of order books for consumer goods in April . 
rising demand from UK customers was buoyed by a modest acceleration in growth of orders from export markets . 
output rose strongly in response , the sharpest rise recorded since last November , with the amount of goods purchased for use in production exhibiting similar growth . 
despite this substantial increase in the quantity of inputs purchased by these producers , few suppliers were found to have experienced difficulty meeting demand and delivery times showed only a modest lengthening . 
meanwhile , prices paid by purchasing managers fell sharply as the cost of imports fell again as a result of the strong pound . 
the investment goods industries recorded the strongest growth of both output and new orders of all three market sectors for the third straight month in April . 
orders from both domestic and overseas markets strengthened , particularly from the United States and the Far East . 
to expand capacity to meet the growth of new business , employment was increased the only sector to record a significant rise in recruitment for the second month running and the largest increase in employment reported by this sector since March 1995 . 
prices paid for raw materials fell sharply again , largely due to lower import prices arising from the exchange rate but also due to the continued ability to negotiate lower prices with certain suppliers operating at below full capacity . 
production of intermediate goods mainly components used by manufacturers of capital and consumer goods rose in April but at the slowest rate of growth since last June . 
these producers were the hardest hit by the stronger pound , with export orders falling slightly as overseas customers switched suppliers and growth of new business from UK firms declining as increasing numbers of customers cancelled orders , choosing lower cost imported inputs instead . 
overall order books nevertheless continued to expand but , in line with output , the rate of growth has slowed over recent months . 
this slower growth was reflected in a modest drop in employment , intended to cut costs and thereby improve competitiveness .
