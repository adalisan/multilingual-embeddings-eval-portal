Slovakia can further sustain its impressive economic growth of the past three years , but the government must correct macroeconomic imbalances that emerged in 1996 , the World Bank said . 
in a report obtained by Reuters on Wednesday , the bank praised Slovakia for one of the best macroeconomic performances in central Europe , but laid down several targets which it considers crucial to maintain the favourable trend . 
Slovakia &apos;s GDP is forecast to grow by some 6.8 to 7.0 percent in 1996 , after a full 1995 increase of 7.4 percent . 
the government expects GDP to grow at least by 6.4 percent in 1997 . 
&quot; In the macroeconomic area , the main issue to be addressed is the recent deterioration of the external accounts , &quot; the report said . 
it pointed to the growing current account deficit which rose to around eight percent of GDP over 1996 , from a two percent surplus in 1995 . 
the bank said a relatively low level of indebtedness ( 35 and 20 percent of GDP in gross and net external debts in the past two years respectively ) and good credit rating allow the country to finance the current accoutn deficit without major difficulties . 
but it warned that the present volume of the current account deficit was not sustainable in the long-term horizon as it could result in excessive increase in indebtedness and possible future finacing problems . 
the bank proposed a medium to long-term macroeconomic framework for sustained growth , in which it calls for fixed investment to remain at some 30 percent of GDP . 
the current account deficit should be reduced to around three percent of the GDP , with financing of at least half of the shortfall through foreign direct investment , the bank said . 
if these targets are met , Slovakia should be able to sustain growth rates of around six percent , it concluded .
