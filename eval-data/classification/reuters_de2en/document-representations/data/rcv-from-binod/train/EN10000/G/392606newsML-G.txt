an Iraqi official denied on Thursday reports that a man arrested in Lebanon for suspected involvement in the killing of Iraqi opposition figures was connected to Iraqi intelligence . 
Saadoun Dawoud , press attache at the Iraqi embassy in Amman , said the reports aimed at discrediting Baghdad and perpetuating U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait . 
judicial sources in Beirut said on Wednesday Bassam Yaaqoub Youssef , 28 , had been arrested in a Convent in Lebanon . 
he was being questioned over allegedly carrying out political assassinations in Kuwait , London , Morocco and Albania on behalf of the Iraqi intelligence , they said . 
&quot; We completely deny any link between Bassam Yaaqoub Youssef and Iraqi intelligence , &quot; Dawoud said in a statement . 
&quot; This news ... is entirely fabricated , devoid of any truth , and paid for by Kuwaiti elements to harm Iraq &apos;s reputation and relations with its Arab brothers ... to continue the oppressive sanctions imposed for more than six years on the women , children and elderly , &quot; Saadoun said . 
no official charges have been filed against Youssef who had last entered Lebanon on October 15 , 1996 .
