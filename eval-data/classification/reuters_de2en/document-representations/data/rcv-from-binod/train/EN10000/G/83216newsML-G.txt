a judge froze the bank accounts of Guatemala &apos;s solicitor general Friday until he resolves a lawsuit over unpaid campaign bills , news reports said . 
solicitor General Acisclo Valladares , a wealthy former prosecutor , politician and outspoken right-wing moral watchdog , made an unsuccesful bid for the presidency last year . 
a Miami printer , Gustavo Adolfo Morales Leon , is suing Valladares and other members of the Liberal Progressive Party for $ 36,475 in unpaid bills from stickers , posters and other campaign literature , said afternoon daily newspaper La Hora . 
according to the newspaper , the Second Judge of First Civil Instance froze Valladares funds and handed down an order prohibiting him from leaving the country .
