a series of corporate failures and a renewed probe into a loans-for-kickbacks scandal surrounding Hanbo Steel Co are expected to weigh on the stock market on Monday , brokers said . 
they said although a technical rebound and selective bargain hunting of banking shares might emerge , jitters about economic uncertainties would overshadow the market . 
&quot; Investors are expected to stay away . 
but bargain hunting in some bank shares would limit the market &apos;s sharp drop , &quot; said Choi Sung-yeong of Coryo Securities . 
the composite index closed 4.50 points lower at 623.13 on Saturday . 
prosecutors reopened a probe into the Hanbo scandal at the weekend and said they would dig into rumours that President Kim Young-sam &apos;s second son took a 200 billion won kickback . 
Hanbo was declared insolvent in January after racking up $ 5.8 billion of debts . 
an earlier probe had led to indictments of 10 people , including bankers and politicians . 
&quot; Those with relatively sound financial structure would attract buying , &quot; said Shim Choong-bo , research manager at Daishin Securities .
