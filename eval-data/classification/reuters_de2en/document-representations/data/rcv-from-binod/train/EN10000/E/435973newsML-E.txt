Yugoslavia &apos;s February trade gap fell to $ 113 million from $ 191 million in January , bringing the overall post-sanctions trade deficit to $ 2.61 billion , economists said . 
according to official statistics , February exports grew 42.8 percent over the same month last year , with imports rising 18.9 percent . 
the accumulated January-February trade gap reached $ 351 million . 
Yugoslavia &apos;s 1996 trade deficit stood at $ 2.26 billion . 
according to the latest available figures , the country &apos;s gross domestic product stood at $ 15.9 billion in 1995 . 
the Statistical Office began issuing trade figures in January 1996 , when the country resumed its foreign trade after 3-1 / 2 years of sanctions which were suspended late in November 1995 and lifted in October 1996 . 
&quot; The monthly trade gap keeps falling and there are signals that unofficial hard currency reserves held by Yugoslav banks and companies abroad are melting down , &quot; Slobodan Milosavljevic of the Institute for Market Research told Reuters on Wednesday . 
after nearly four years of an international trade embargo , with industry falling to around 40 percent of its pre-1991 level , Yugoslavia turned to imports needed to kick-start its idling production capacities . 
despite huge 1996 imports exceeding $ 4 billion , many companies claim their raw material inventories are still insufficient , Milosavljevic added . 
even though raw materials and semi-finished goods accounted for over 65 percent of the total 1996 imports , the situation in the country &quot; s inefficient industry has not improved . 
buying raw materials and kick-starting local production did not always lead to higher exports , for which Yugoslav products remain uncompetitive in price and quality . 
&quot; Industry faces a shrunken domestic market with low purchasing power of local consumers but also numerous obstacles to selling abroad . 
things are even worse since Yugoslavia still does not enjoy trade preferences , &quot; Milosavljevic said . 
economists saw no improvement until Yugoslavia regulates its membership with World Trade Organisation . 
domestic industry also cited lack of working capital and insufficient support from banks in obtaining foreign credits as another obstacle to reviving production . 
&quot; Banks are usually asked to provide performance bonds , but Yugoslav banks were frequently required to provide 100 percent guarantees for such deals , &quot; another economist said . 
huge $ 4.1 billion imports in 1996 and enormous quantities of raw material coming to the country translated into a 7.5 percent industry growth last year . 
&quot; The state must not curb imports by any means . 
imports are needed to stimulate production and production for more exports , &quot; said Zivojin Jevtic of the Institute for Foreign Trade . 
economists said Yugoslav economy could sustain a trade gap growing by only as much as $ 100 million per month in 1997 . 
&quot; If the monthly trade gap grows by $ 200 million a month , Yugoslavia will see its 1997 trade gap doubling . 
but if the deficit rises by $ 100 million per month , the annual trade deficit will be reduced substantially , &quot; said Stojan Stamenkovic of the Institute for Economic Scineces . 
the lower 1997 trade gap , if considered isolated from the 1996 deficit , could partially be covered by the expected $ 500 million surplus in the services sector . 
bringing the current account into balance could jeopardize the economy unless the state embarks on radical reforms . 
&quot; The state must also urgently come to terms with world financial bodies and get fresh financial help without which Yugoslavia will sink into an even deeper recession , &quot; he said .
