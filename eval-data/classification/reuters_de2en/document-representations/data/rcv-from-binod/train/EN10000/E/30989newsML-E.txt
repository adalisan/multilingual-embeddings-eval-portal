the Finnish government on Tuesday submitted its budget proposal for 1997 to parliament , saying it was confident about solid growth based on increased consumer demand and investment . 
the 191 billion markka budget forecasts a 3.9 percent growth in gross domestic product ( GDP ) and a 4.1 percent increase in domestic demand . 
&quot; It is a budget of confidence , &quot; Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen said on national television on Tuesday morning . 
he said ordinary citizens as well as business could feel confident about the future . 
&quot; We have stabilised the economy , &quot; Lipponen said . 
under the proposal , net state borrowing would fall to some 29 billion markka in 1997 from about 45 billion this year . 
the finance ministry &apos;s budget chief Erkki Virtanen told a news conference Finland had finally left behind the stage where borrowing was the biggest single source of revenue . 
in 1997 , income tax would generate 26 percent and value-added tax 25 percent of revenue while borrowing would account for only 15 percent . 
in this year &apos;s budget , income tax was expected to stand for 20 percent of revenue , VAT for 23.5 percent and borrowing for 20 percent . 
as part of the new budget , the government will change legislation to reduce taxpayers &apos; income taxes by 5.5 billion markka . 
this is expected to entice households to spend more , thus helping to generate growth . 
private consumption is expected to rise by 3.8 percent . 
confidence in the corporate sector should be boosted by the assumption that interest rates will remain low as the budget offers assurances of continued slow inflation and expects a hefty current account surplus . 
the public sector deficit will fall to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1997 -- the year when countries &apos; performances are judged against EMU entry criteria -- from 2.9 percent this year . 
Finnish gross public debt will be in decline , from 61.8 percent this year to 61.0 percent in 1997 and so come within one percentage point of the EMU debt criterion . 
&quot; Finland has good prospects for fulfilling the convergence criteria in 1997 , &quot; the government said . 
&quot; Finland &apos;s objective is to fulfil the convergence criteria ... so that Finland could participate in EMU right at the beginning in 1997 , &quot; it said in an updated convergence programme released with the budget . 
due to technical changes , not too many figures in the actual budget are comparable with figures from earlier years , Virtanen said . 
but he said total 1997 state expenditure projected at 200.4 billion markka could be roughly compared with 212.9 billion in 1996 .
