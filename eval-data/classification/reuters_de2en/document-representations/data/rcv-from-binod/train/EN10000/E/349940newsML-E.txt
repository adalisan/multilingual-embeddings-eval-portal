if interest rates do not come down soon , the Israeli economy will face even slower growth than the government is projecting , a top Treasury official warned on Sunday . 
Treasury director-general David Brodet said economic indicators for the end of 1996 , such as industrial production and electricity consumption , were pointing to a further slowing of the economy . 
he blamed the phenomenon squarely on the Bank of Israel &apos;s restrictive monetary policy 
&quot; If this trend continues at the same pace in 1997 , we expect that 1997 will be slower than we expected and I must say I am worried , &quot; Brodet said . 
&quot; We find ourselves , it seems for the first time in the Israeli economy , in a slowdown that has been created entirely by monetary policy and one I am not sure the government decided intentionally to implement , &quot; Brodet said . 
the Treasury is expecting gross domestic product to expand four percent this year , although many private sector economists have issued more pessimistic forecasts . 
short-term interest rates have been declining since the middle of last year , with the Bank of Israel cutting them last week by 0.5 percentage point to 14.2 percent . 
but Brodet said inflation had fallen just as quickly , leaving real interest rates at high levels . 
Brodet also warned about the extent of the Bank of Israel &apos;s monetary injection into the economy in the last month . 
he estimated the central bank had injected as much as 3.5 billion shekels in a bid to to prevent the basket of foreign currencies , to which the Israeli shekel is officially pegged , from slipping below its trading band . 
&quot; The most obvious sign of the problems in 1997 is the massive liquidity the Bank of Israel injected into the economy in the first month of the year , &quot; Brodet said . 
&quot; The injection for January was more than half of what the government injected in all of 1996 . 
he denied persistent newspaper reports that the Treasury and central bank had discussed a Bank of Israel proposal to widen the band or to increase the quota for Makam short-term certificates . 
the central bank issues the certificates for terms up to one year as a means of absorbing liquidity in the economy . 
the shekel is allowed to fluctuate in a trading band of seven percent above or below a sloping mid-point designed to devalue the Israeli currency at a rate of six percent a year against the basket of key currencies . 
Brodet conceded that the Treasury could face further budgetary problems later this year but downplayed their importance . 
&quot; I don &apos;t want to say that there may not be problems connected with fiscal policy , &quot; he said . 
&quot; On fiscal policy we know what needs to be done . 
if it become clear that the deficit exceeds the target , we have to bring it back in . 
he termed the exchange problems now facing the economy the fruit of two years of a misguided restrictive monetary policy . 
high domestic interest rates had drawn in some $ 10 billion in capital imports , mainly from Israeli businesses taking advantage of cheaper foreign currency loans . 
he estimated the Bank of Israel had to absorb some 40 billion shekels over the last two years by reducing the size of monetary tenders , increasing the Makam quota , introducing currency swaps and raising reserve requirements , all at great cost to economic growth .
