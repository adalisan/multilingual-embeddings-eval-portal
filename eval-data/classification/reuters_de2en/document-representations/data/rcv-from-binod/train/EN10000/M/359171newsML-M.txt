the South African rand touched its strongest level in four months on Wednesday , pushing through 4.50 against the dollar . 
the rand last traded at the 4.50 level on October 3 , 1996 . 
at 0925 GMT , the currency was quoted at 4.4925 / 4955 against the dollar from 4.5265 / 5295 at the local close on Tuesday . 
some dealers said they believed the Reserve Bank had helped push the currency through the psychological 4.50 level , although the bulk of the business reflected large dollar sales from Europe and from U.S. investment banks . 
reserve Bank officials were not immediately available for comment on the market speculation . 
the rand has now firmed 20 cents or 4.3 percent from around 4.70 against the dollar since the beginning of the year and dealers said that chart levels pointed to a move to 4.4850 and then 4.4775 .
