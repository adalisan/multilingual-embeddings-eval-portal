a violent downturn after a full-point rally in U.S. Treasury bond futures this morning diminished prospects of a swift recovery from this month &apos;s pullback , technical analysts said . 
September T-bond futures dived to a low of 111-31 / 32 after spiking up to a high of 113-19 / 32 from Tuesday &apos;s 112-15 / 32 close after friendly July retail sales and producer price numbers . 
on the way down , the contract broke below the 112-8 / 32 area , the lows from last Friday and Monday which had been looking like a possible &quot; double bottom &quot; reversal pattern . 
the September futures had subsequently clawed back up to the mid-112 area by mid-morning . 
&quot; To me , it looks like it &apos;s trying to base or stabilize , &quot; said Jim Bohan , senior financial futures strategist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . 
&quot; But looking at the wideness of the bar ( on the daily chart ) today , it &apos;s important that we close strong . 
he said today &apos;s wide fluctuation made for an &quot; outside day &quot; -- with a lower low and a higher high than the previous day -- and that a strong finish was needed to provide a bullish reversal signal . 
short of that , he added , one or two points of further decline might be in store before another basing opportunity emerged . 
Bohan saw the low of late June and early July around 111 as the next major support . 
&quot; At some point , I would expect the market to head toward the highs again , &quot; said Stewart Taylor of Taylor Consulting , agreeing on the market &apos;s longer-term positive trend . 
&quot; But the question now is , does it do it from here or does it do it from lower levels , and it &apos;s looking more and more like it will be from lower levels . 
Bohan said selling by foreign investors was becoming an important factor in the bond market , and the dollar &apos;s slide since last Friday was worrying . 
the dollar , which had climbed to within a whisker of 1.90 marks and 120 yen only a week ago , was down at around 1.8350 marks and 115.50 yen in mid-morning U.S. business . 
analysts were skeptical whether Thursday &apos;s July consumer price index could be a positive catalyst for the market , given today &apos;s short-lived rally after retail sales and producer price numbers . 
July &apos;s producer price index fell 0.1 percent in both the overall and the core rates against average Wall Street estimates of a 0.1 point rise in each . 
July retail sales gained 0.6 percent overall versus forecasts for a 0.7 percent gain .
