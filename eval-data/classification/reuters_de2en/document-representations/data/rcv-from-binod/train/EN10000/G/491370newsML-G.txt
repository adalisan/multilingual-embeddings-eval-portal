the crew of space shuttle Columbia on Monday used flashlights to work in their darkened , power-starved spaceship as they crammed in some last-minute research and prepared to come home early . 
NASA ordered the shuttle back to Earth after one of three crucial electricity-generating fuel cells failed on Sunday , less than two days into what was to have been a 16-day science mission . 
the $ 2 billion reusable spaceship was scheduled to land in Florida on Tuesday . 
&quot; Everybody is disappointed that we are going to have to come home early , &quot; shuttle commander Jim Halsell told a news conference on Monday . 
other crew members felt &quot; shock and disbelief &quot; at the news , astronaut Donald Thomas said . 
Columbia &apos;s crew of seven has been living in near-darkness since the troublesome power generator was shut down on Sunday , working with flashlights . 
all non-essential equipment including most of the lighting was turned off to conserve power for scientific experiments in the shuttle &apos;s laboratory . 
&quot; It &apos;s a little dark in here , &quot; Thomas told ground controllers . 
the fuel cells provide all of the shuttle &apos;s electrical power and NASA &apos;s strict safety rules require the spaceship to return to Earth if one fails . 
&quot; This is one of the original electric &apos; fly by wire &apos; airplanes , &quot; said Halsell . 
&quot; We depend upon electricity for this airplane to fly . 
the shuttle can land safely with two functioning fuel cells and could probably limp home on one if necessary , according to NASA officials . 
Columbia was to have spent more than two weeks aloft performing an $ 86 million scientific programme including studies of the behaviour of fire in space , medical research and the development of near-perfect alloys . 
the space laboratory had barely been set up when the mission was cut short and the astronauts have scrambled to accomplish as much work as possible with the limited time and power available . 
&quot; We &apos;ve been working double time trying to make up for what we &apos;re missing by shortening the mission , &quot; Thomas said . 
only a fraction of the planned scientific experiments will be performed before the laboratory is shut late on Monday in readiness for the shuttle &apos;s homecoming . 
weather conditions at the Florida spaceport looked favourable for the touchdown . 
there were also opportunities to land at the shuttle &apos;s back-up runway in California , but high winds could be a problem there . 
it was only the third time in 83 missions a space shuttle had been called home early because of a mechanical breakdown .
