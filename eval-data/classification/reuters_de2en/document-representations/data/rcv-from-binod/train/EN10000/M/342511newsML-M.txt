Tokyo rubber futures ended firmer across the board on Wednesday , as the yen &apos;s steep fall against the dollar stimulated short-covering in a correction after prices had eased in recent days , traders said . 
prices ranged from 0.4 yen to 1.5 yen per kg higher . 
benchmark July was up 1.5 yen at 143.6 yen . 
prices gained ground , backed by a further slip in the yen , although easier Thai rubber offer prices to Japan undermined sentiment . 
&quot; Despite a slight price rebound today , sentiment remained bearish amid a lack of speculative interest , &quot; one trader said .
