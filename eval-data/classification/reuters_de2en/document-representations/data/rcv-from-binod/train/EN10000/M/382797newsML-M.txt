Irish bonds were marginally down in thin late trade on Monday in line with overseas markets primarily due to a lack of direction as the U.S. remained closed for a Bank Holiday , dealers said . 
dealers said the market awaited Tuesday &apos;s domestic auctions when Ireland &apos;s National Treasury Management Agency ( NTMA ) will auction 150 million Irish pounds of the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 in a competitive auction for primary dealers at 1000 GMT . 
up to 30 million will be offered in a non-competitive auction , dealers said . 
&quot; Today has been very quiet with the U.S. closed . 
that has been a good excuse to do nothing . 
the Irish market has been well under-pinned , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; It is hard to know how the auctions will go tomorrow . 
we have seen no selling pressure today . 
maybe we will see some tomorrow ahead of the auctions but for the moment we continue to tread water , &quot; the dealer added . 
by 1610 GMT , the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was down two pence from Friday &apos;s close at 103.53 to yield 5.61 percent while the key benchmark eight percent bond due 2006 was down 10 pence at 111.60 to yield 6.33 percent . 
dealers said Irish bonds were trading at 128 basis points over German bunds in the five year area and 82 basis points over Germany in the 10-year area .
