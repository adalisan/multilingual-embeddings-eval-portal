the Chinese yuan rose sharply on a technical rebound after falls in the past four days , closing at 8.3008 against the U.S. dollar from Monday &apos;s 8.3022 on the Shanghai-based interbank foreign exchange market , traders said . 
the yuan opened slightly up at 8.3017 and consolidated down early in the session , hitting an intra-day low of 8.3020 . 
it then turned to rise on some short-covering buying during the rest of the session , hitting a high of 8.3005 . 
trading was active , with most done at 8.3015 , dealers said . 
dealers said that the yuan &apos;s rise reflected the market &apos;s belief that macro-economic credit controls are not being relaxed . 
&quot; From the economic work meeting ( held in Beijing last weekend ) , we can see that the tight policy will continue through next year to keep pressure on inflation , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; That means the demand for the yuan will be still big and give it room to rise further . 
&quot; But the yuan is likely to have problems rising much further before the year-end due to the expectation that the central bank will intervene to keep it down , &quot; said a second dealer . 
dealers expected the yuan to move below 8.30 tomorrow . 
the yuan closed up at 7.3640 from 7.4285 against 100 Japanese yen and down slightly at 1.0737 from 1.0731 against the Hong Kong dollar .
