Russian President Boris Yeltsin jokingly called himself Boris the First on Friday after a multitude of media reports likening him to a tsar . 
Yeltsin , on holiday in Karelia , northwest Russia , said he had particularly enjoyed his stay because he was the first Russian ruler to visit since 18th century Tsar Peter the Great . 
&quot; No Russian leader had come here on holiday since Peter I. 
now Boris the First has been , &quot; said Yeltsin , shown on television before flying to continue his vacation at a sanatorium near Togliatti on the Volga River . 
&quot; nearly every day we swam in the lake and visited the Russian steam bath , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The nature was beautiful , the air was beautiful . 
the Russian media say Yeltsin , who was elected for a second term a year ago , has taken on airs and have often likened his fatherly and regal manner to that of a tsar . 
Itar-Tass news agency quoted local residents as saying that Yeltsin &apos;s stay in Korelia , accompanied by the usual tight security measures , had not troubled them . 
&quot; We were fishing and swimming in the same lake where you were fishing , &quot; TASS quoted one man as telling Yeltsin when he made a stopover in a village on his way to the airport . 
&quot; The security measures did not bother me . 
Yeltsin faced serious health problems after he won his second term in the Kremlin last summer . 
the 66-year-old president underwent heart bypass surgery in November and suffered pneumonia in January . 
his health has improved since . 
such was the balance , &quot; he said , swiping away mosquitoes with his hand .
