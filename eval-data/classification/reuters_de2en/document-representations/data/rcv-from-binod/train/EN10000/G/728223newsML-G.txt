the South African selectors have made four changes to their team to play New Zealand in the Tri-Nations match at Ellis Park on Saturday . 
out from the side which won the last test against the British Lions two weeks ago are Johan Erasmus , Dawie Theron , James Dalton and Hannes Strydom . 
in come Mark Andrews , Ruben Kruger , Marius Hurter and Naka Drotske . 
lock forward Andrews missed the last two Lions tests with an injury and is a straight swap for Strydom . 
the same is true of Kruger who replaces Erasmus on the flank . 
a calf injury has ruled out Dalton and Drotske regains the hookers berth he lost for the last test against the Lions . 
Hurter is back in favour for the first time this season and he takes over the tight head prop role from Theron who moves to the bench . 
Chris Rossouw , the hooker who played in the World Cup final , has been called up as a replacement . 
in addition , veteran wing James Small has overcome a hamstring strain and stands by too . 
coach Carel du Plessis resisted the temptation to recall Small , saying that the back line which did duty in the last game deserved a vote of confidence . 
that means a second test cap for flyhalf Jannie de Beer , with Henry Honiball still among the reserves . 
Honiball will understudy the flyhalf and centre roles , while Small is cover for wing and fullback with Andre Joubert &apos;s groin strain ruling him out .. 
new Zealand named the team which beat Australia 30-13 in Christchurch on July 5 .
