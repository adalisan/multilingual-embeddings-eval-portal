shares across Indian bourses finished lower on Thursday with market action limited to select blue-chip stocks , traders said . 
&quot; There is no major factor playing in the market -- some expectations about fresh buying didn &apos;t materialise , &quot; said dealer Dheeraj Agarwal at SSKI Securities in Bombay . 
the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange ( BSE ) 30-share index fell 31.03 points or 0.96 percent to 3,195.77 , a touch above its intra-day low of 3,190.36 . 
selling by some foreign funds dragged the SBI stock 10.75 rupees lower to 239.0 , after hitting the day &apos;s high of 252.75 in volumes of 8.5 million shares . 
the 50-stock National Stock Exchange index lost 11.35 points or 1.21 percent to 936.27 . 
Fund buying in MTNL pushed it up 7.50 rupees to 213.0 and heavy speculative buying by Calcutta-based operators helped ITC gain 10.50 to 312.75 , traders said . 
the Calcutta index fell 1.84 points to 421.54 . 
at the Delhi Stock Exchange , share prices closed lower on lack of strong buying support as institutional investors stayed on the sideline in a day of thin trade , dealers said . 
the Delhi index was 3.75 points lower at 715.99 . 
the Madras index dropped 28.51 points or 0.85 percent to 3,344.76 .
