two U.N. human rights investigators were arriving in Nigeria on Sunday for a two-week mission under terms that tightly limit who they will be able to question . 
Bacre Waly Ndiaye , a Senegalese who is U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and Param Cumaraswamy , a Malaysian who is U.N. special rapporteur on independence of judges and lawyers , were due to land in the evening and stay until March 5 . 
&quot; Essentially they are coming on terms which we have thrashed out and consider agreeable , &quot; a senior state official involved in the negotiations told editors in the capital Abuja . 
while state officials made clear they would limit access , diplomats and human rights activists said the outcome would hinge on whether investigators could see political prisoners . 
it is the second U.N. team to visit Nigeria in 12 months . 
a mission last year found human rights &quot; terrible &quot; but called for support for the government &apos;s democracy programme . 
Africa &apos;s most populous nation , with 100 million people , has been a pariah since June 1993 when a former army ruler annulled a poll to restore democracy . 
in the ensuing chaos , General Sani Abacha seized power five months later . 
Nigeria &apos;s standing was further hit in 1995 when it hanged nine minority rights activists , including author Ken Saro-Wiwa . 
they had been convicted of murder in a trial judged unfair by international experts . 
another 19 Ogoni youths facing similar charges are still in detention . 
in response , the U.N. human rights commission watchdog appointed the two rapporteurs to investigate . 
but Abacha &apos;s special adviser on legal affairs Anwalu Yadudu told reporters last week : &quot; Their mandate restricts them to independence of judges , extra-judicial killings and summary execution of accused persons . 
Western diplomats said the success of the visit would be measured by whether investigators met high-profile detainees like Moshood Abiola , who is thought to have won the 1993 election but has been held on treason charges since 1994 when he proclaimed himself president . 
others behind bars include former military ruler Olusegun Obasanjo and his then deputy Shehu Musa Yar &apos;Adua , who in 1995 were convicted along with four journalists and many others for allegedly plotting to overthow Abacha . 
&quot; The rapporteurs will not meet convicted prisoners . 
if they request to see other detainees this will be considered strictly in accordance with the terms of their visit , &quot; said an official . 
the U.N. team is due to visit several big cities including Abuja , Lagos , Kaduna , Kano and Port Harcourt . 
Abacha &apos;s government has continually rejected what it terms foreign interference and said it will follow its timetable for restoring democracy . 
it has set October 1 , 1998 as the date to hand over to a democratically-elected president , although there is speculation Abacha will seek election himself . 
&quot; No nation can claim a clean slate on human rights and we won &apos;t allow countries with an anti-Nigeria agenda to use the human rights smokescreen against Nigeria , &quot; said a senior official at the briefing of editors . 
another said : &quot; Once there is military rule you can &apos;t expect human rights to be perfect . 
the investigators will report to the 53-member U.N. Human Rights Commission . 
the main U.N. human rights forum opens its annual six-week meeting in Geneva on March 10 .
