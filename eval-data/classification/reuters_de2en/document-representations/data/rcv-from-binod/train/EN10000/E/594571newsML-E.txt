bankers Trust Research said on Monday it had cut its 1997 GDP growth forecast for Mexico to 4.5 percent from 4.8 percent , adding the biggest threat to growth was sluggish consumer demand . 
&quot; We have reduced our forecast for GDP growth from 4.8 percent to 4.5 percent year on year and the risk may be to the downside , &quot; Denis Parisien , vice president for Latin American Research said in a report to investors . 
&quot; The biggest threat to growth is the lack of comsumer demand , &quot; he added . 
&quot; The main impediment to the recovery in consumption is that real wage growth remains in negative territory and employment growth , while strong in the manufacturing sector , remains fairly weak overall . 
earlier on Monday Mexico released first quarter GDP growth of 5.1 percent , which was in line with revised forecasts after the government deflated higher expectations late last week . 
&quot; Mexican Q1 industry and trade data have thus far shown that the large year on year percent gains reminiscent of the economic recovery in 1996 are receding , as the base period for 1997 comparision rises and the lack of dynamism in private consumption remains a serious drag on growth , &quot; Parisien added . 
he also pointed to a slowdown in industrial production and in trade . 
&quot; As a result we are lowering our forecast moderately for Mexican GDP growth from 4.8 percent to 4.5 percent , &quot; he said .
