President Bill Clinton on Friday named William Ruckelshaus , a former Cabinet official , to lead U.S. efforts to resolve the dispute with Canada over salmon fishing . 
Ruckelshaus , former head of the Environmental Protection Agency , will lead U.S. attempts to resolve the dispute over the interpretation and implementation of the Pacific Salmon Treaty , signed in 1985 . 
the two countries agreed on Wednesday to appoint special envoys to try to restart talks on the issue . 
they will report directly to Clinton and Prime Minister Jean Chretien . 
the decision followed a confrontation during which Canadian fishing boats blockaded an Alaskan ferry for three days in Prince Rupert , British Columbia , to back their protest against alleged U.S. overfishing .
