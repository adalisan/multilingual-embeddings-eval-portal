President Bill Clinton led Republican Bob Dole by 14.8 percentage points on Monday in the Reuters daily tracking poll and appeared to hold a commanding position two days before the final presidential debate . 
the poll , conducted by John Zogby Group International , tracks about 900 likely voters over a three-day period . 
the latest result , with a 3.3 percentage point margin of error , reflects polling on Friday through Sunday . 
Clinton had 47.7 percent , ahead of Dole &apos;s 32.9 percent . 
reform Party candidate Ross Perot trailed with 4.6 percent and 12.1 percent of respondents were still undecided . 
until recently , Clinton &apos;s strength was not being passed on to Democratic congressional candidates , but that has changed in the past three days , raising the possibility that the Democrats could recapture at least one house of Congress . 
asked whom they would support in their local congressional district , 39.4 percent said Democrats and 33.9 percent said Republicans . 
some analysts now give the Democrats a 50-50 chance of regaining the majority in the House of Representatives only two years after losing it to Republicans . 
Clinton and Dole meet in their second and last debate on Wednesday in San Diego . 
with Election Day only three weeks away , the poll suggested the president had little to fear . 
dole has not exceeded 39 percent in any Reuters poll since August , while Clinton has not fallen below 43 percent . 
he now leads Dole in every region of the country , although the race has tightened in the Republican stronghold of the South . 
he also leads among every age group , every ethnic group and every income group . 
&quot; This is the sixth straight day that Clinton &apos;s lead has increased . 
in one week it has gone from 5.3 percent to today &apos;s 14.8 percent , &quot; pollster John Zogby said . 
&quot; Time is running out for Dole and it is not surprising that he and his advisers have decided on the risky option of attacking Clinton &apos;s character . 
nothing else has worked to date . 
significantly , Clinton was gaining 23 percent of the vote among those describing themselves as &quot; very conservative &quot; and 29 percent of those who say they are &quot; conservative . 
dole has the support of only 71 percent of Republicans while Clinton has 87 percent of Democratic votes . 
Clinton leads among independents by 19 percentage points . 
he leads by five points among men and 23 points among women .
