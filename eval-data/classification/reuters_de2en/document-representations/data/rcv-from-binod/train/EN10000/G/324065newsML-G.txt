it &apos;s cold -- on average minus 16 degrees celcius ( 3F ) -- it &apos;s dark , and worst of all , there &apos;s nothing to eat . 
so how do emperor penguins keep warm while they sit on their single eggs ? 
simple , say French researchers in a letter to the science journal Nature . 
they huddle together , the old-fashioned way . 
but this is not as much fun as it sounds , Yvon le Maho and colleagues at the French national research centre CNRS in Strasbourg said . 
all the penguins involved are male . 
each spends up to 115 days sitting on the lone egg while its mates head out to sea to fatten up . 
Le Maho set out to find how the penguins can keep warm for so long without food and without moving , and found that huddling allows them both to save energy and keep from freezing . 
those who huddle keep a metabolic rate 25 percent below that of birds on their own , they said &quot; males that are isolated , and therefore unable to huddle , cannot cope with the long fast necessary for successful incubation , &quot; the letter said .
