---------------------- ( July 1 ) ------------------------------ 
* Australian bonds firm in early trade as market waits for possible rate cut announcement by Reserve Bank at 9.30 a.m. ( 2330 GMT ) following Tuesday &apos;s board meeting . 
* May retail trade , building approvals also due on Wednesday 
Australian bonds were firm in early trade as the market waited to see if the Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) would announce an easing in official interest rates at 9.30 a.m. ( 2330 GMT ) on Wednesday . 
the RBA board met on Tuesday , and this morning is its first opportunity to ease . 
sentiment favoured no policy change announcement today , but the market was not taking any chances . 
&quot; I &apos;d think general sentiment is there won &apos;t be one , if there is going to be one it will be later in the month , but people aren &apos;t going to be short at 9.30 , &quot; one trader said . 
traders and analysts said a cut was more likely either on Thursday , after the outcome of the U.S. FOMC meeting is known , or later in the month after wages and inflation data are out . 
alternatively , the RBA may decide not to cut rates until after the August 5 board meeting . 
Australia &apos;s official cash rate is currently at 5.50 percent , having been lowered on four occasions since last July , when the rate stood at 7.50 percent . 
if there is no rate cut this morning , market attention will focus on May retail trade and building approvals data later in the morning , with any unexpected strength seen casting some doubts on the possibility of further rate cuts . 
both series are forecast to show rises of 2.0 percent , with retail trade expected to reverse April &apos;s 1.7 percent fall and building approvals expected to be in line with other evidence of a modest housing upswing . 
spreads unchanged to slightly wider after the outperformance of Tuesday , and treasuries &apos; overnight reversal of Monday &apos;s losses . 
spreads may widen if market pulls back from opening levels if no rate cut is delivered .
