two people were killed and four others injured in a shootout between police and Chol Indians in the troubled southern Mexican state of Chiapas , officials said on Saturday . 
police agent Gabriel Galdamez Sanchez , 23 , died after he and other officers were ambushed by Chol Indians early on Friday near the village of Sabanilla , some 60 miles ( 100 km ) northeast of state capital Tuxtla-Gutierrez , the state government said in a statement . 
police repelled the attack , killing an unidentified Indian and wounding two others , according to the statement . 
two policemen were injured in the incident and another Chol Indian arrested . 
Mexico City daily La Jornada on Saturday reported that local villagers disputed the official version of events , saying police and paramilitary groups were harassing the group of Indians and provoked the incident . 
la Jornada said the group was headed to join a cross-state march by some 500 Indian activists , who were forced out of their homes by paramilitary groups in the northern part of the state . 
violence in Chiapas has been on the rise in the three months since Zapatista Indian rebels and the government suspended peace talks .
