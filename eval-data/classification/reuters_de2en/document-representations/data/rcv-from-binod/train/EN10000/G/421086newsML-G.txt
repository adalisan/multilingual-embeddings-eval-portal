Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday it would send home any pilgrim caught carrying political material at the annual Moslem pilgrimage due next month , Saudi state-run television reported . 
it quoted a Saudi Interior Ministry statement as telling pilgrims they were not allowed to carry any books , pictures and pamphlets that have &quot; a political or propaganda aim &quot; . 
&quot; anybody found in possession of anything forbidden , no matter what kind it is , will face severe punishment in line with local laws and regulations , &quot; it said . 
&quot; Any violator will expose himself to punishment and will be sent to where he came from &quot; . 
the ministry , which issued a similar warning last month , said it put out the statement as part of preparations for the Haj . 
up to two million Moslems -- one million of them from abroad -- perform Haj at Mecca and Medina , two of Islam &apos;s holiest shrines , every year . 
Shi &apos;ite clerics ruling Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution say Moslems have the right to air their political grievances during the pilgrimage , mainly through rallies against Israel amd the United States . 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s conservative Sunni rulers say the Haj , which draws Moslems from around the world , is purely religious . 
Saudi security forces clashed in 1987 with demonstrators in an Iranian-led rally in the streets of Mecca , killing about 400 people , mainly Iranians . 
Iran boycotted the Haj for the next three years . 
there has been no repeat of the bloodshed since the return of Iranian pilgrims in 1991 and their Haj rallies have been low-key affairs confined to the Iranian compounds .
