shares in talisman Energy Inc surged on Thursday after the company announced two prolific Alberta natural gas finds . 
talisman said its Apetowun well in Alberta &apos;s Edson region flowed raw gas on initial test at 52.8 million cubic feet a day . 
another find , in the Lovett River area in the central Alberta Rocky Mountain foothills , tested at 22.6 million cubic feet a day , the company said . 
talisman shares jumped 2.00 to 45.75 in early Toronto Stock Exchange trade . 
&quot; The Apetowun well will supply gas to our Edson plant , while the Lovett River well establishes the central Alberta foothills as a large and important play for the company , &quot; talisman Chief Executive Jim Buckee said in a statement . 
&quot; Lovett River also demonstrates talisman &apos;s ability to quickly build a core position in a new area and overcome the considerable technical challenges in locating and drilling these wells , &quot; Buckee said . 
talisman has a 70 percent stake in the Apetowun play and partner Renata Resources Inc holds the remainder . 
Lovett River is 100-percent talisman owned . 
the company also said its Sukunka d-81-B / 93-P-5 well in northeastern British Columbia flowed at an initial 35 million cubic feet a day and was expected to be tied in later this year .
