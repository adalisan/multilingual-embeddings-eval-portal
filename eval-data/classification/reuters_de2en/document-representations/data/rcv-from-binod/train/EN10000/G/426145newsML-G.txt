angry mobs burned or beat to death two alleged sorcerers in Ivory Coast &apos;s commercial capital Abidjan after a shrinking or disappearing penis scare spread from neighbouring Ghana . 
police confirmed details of Thursday &apos;s killings and related incidents and police commanders on Friday ordered that all impromptu gatherings in the city be dispersed in an effort to prevent the attacks spreading . 
such reports are not uncommon in West Africa . 
purported victims often blame handshakes with sorcerers . 
at least 12 men were killed in Ghana in January by mobs accusing them of making penises shrink or vanish . 
police in Ghana and Ivory Coast dismiss the phenomenon as a ploy by thieves to cause a crowd to form and then rob people . 
Ivorian police said one alleged sorcerer was covered in petrol and set alight in Abidjan &apos;s populous Koumassi suburb and a second beaten to death in Port Bouet on the outskirts of the city . 
in a fourth incident , secondary school students demonstrated outside a local police station in the teeming Yopougon suburb demanding action against a stranger they accused of making a fellow student &apos;s penis disappear . 
the students had chased the man to the police station , where he took refuge , police said . 
victims say sorcerers simply touch them and make their penises to shrink or vanish by witchcraft to extort cash in return for a cure . 
similar cases have been reported in Ivory Coast in recent weeks but until Thursday no deaths . 
State television carried details of one case on its main evening news on Wednesday , quoting a victim in a light-hearted report . 
the independent newspaper Le Jour carried a front-page photograph of the charred Koumassi body and quoted witnesses as saying that the man had been burned as a sorcerer . 
residents in Accra recall a similar scare in the early 1980s . 
they attributed the scale of the crisis there to the fact that genitals are used in certain voodoo rituals . 
Ghana state television interviewed experts on the subject who explained in minute medical detail how and why penises shrink or expand . 
the scare spread from the capital Accra to upcountry towns and then subsided .
