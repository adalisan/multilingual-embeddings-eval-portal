Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto pledged on Tuesday to speed up the government &apos;s plans on fiscal reform , a key ruling party member told reporters . 
Hashimoto was quoted as saying he would aim to reduce state deficit ( corrects fron &quot; debt &quot; ) to three percent or less of annual gross domestic product ( GDP ) by 2003 ( corrects year from 2002 ) , shortening the period by three years from the government &apos;s original target of 2005 . 
Hashimoto made his remarks at a meeting of ministers and ruling party officials set up to discuss reform of Japan &apos;s fiscal structure . 
the prime minister chaired the meeting . 
former prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone quoted Hashimoto as saying he would seek to stop issues of deficit-financing bonds by 2002 , instead of 2005 , in order to cut the government &apos;s dependency on bonds to finance the state budget . 
Deficit-financing bonds , unlike construction bonds used mainly for infrastructure projects , are issued to fund shortfalls of current administrative costs . 
the government will also cut spending and keep general spending in the fiscal year starting April 1998 under that of the previous year , Hashimoto was quoted as saying . 
general spending in the national budget for the 1997 / 98 fiscal year starting on April 1 is set to rise 1.5 percent from the amount earmarked in the original 1996 / 97 budget , the lowest growth since 1989 / 90 . 
Japan &apos;s outstanding debt , including both central and regional governments , accounted for about 90 percent of GDP at the end of 1996 . 
Japan &apos;s fiscal deficit for calendar 1997 is seen at around 6.3 percent of gross domestic product , one of the worst levels among major industrialised countries . 
Hashimoto was also quoted as saying that he would try to keep the burden of social security costs and taxes to a minimum .
