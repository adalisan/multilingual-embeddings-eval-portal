Bank stocks bore the brunt of heavy selling which sent the Thai bourse to a fresh eight year low of 530.62 on Friday . 
Thai banks tumbled 4.55 percent as foreign investors deserted the sector to raise baht funds amid a widening differential between offshore and onshore baht / dollar rates , traders and analysts said . 
&quot; I think the sales today are really a liquidity driven thing . 
banks being big liquid stocks and will tend to bear the brunt of it , &quot; said Alistair Macdonald , banking sector analyst at Asia Equity . 
the dominant banking sector , a normal favourite among foreign investors , was hard hit as foreigners sold to raise baht to close currency positions or for arbitrage on onshore and offshore baht rates , they said . 
since the Bank of Thailand moved last month to restrict access to offshore baht to thwart speculative attack on the currency , there has been a growing spread between onshore and offshore rates . 
the baht was quoted at 23.950 per dolar offshore on Friday against an onshore rate of around 25.81 . 
with one month swap positions taken during last month &apos;s major attack on the baht maturing , foreigners have scrambled for offshore baht , currency traders said . 
while the central bank measure has caused large losses among speculators , the restriction also threatened to block capital infllows and hurt the stock market , traders said . 
&quot; These currency controls have put them between a rock and a hard place . 
it seems pretty obvious that when there is a near eight percent difference between the baht onshore and offshore , someone is going to try at take advantage of it , &quot; said a trader at a major local brokerage . 
major banks retreated to three to four year lows . 
Siam Commercial Bank plc ended down nine baht at 102 , Thai Farmers Bank plc fell 4.50 to 93 , and Bangkok Bank plc dipped six to 142 . 
concerns over lower profitability and the extent to which banks have to assist ailing finance subsidiaries are legitimate , analysts said . 
but these negative factors have long been known to the market and there was little fundamental news to markedly change sentiment on the sector on Friday , analysts said .
