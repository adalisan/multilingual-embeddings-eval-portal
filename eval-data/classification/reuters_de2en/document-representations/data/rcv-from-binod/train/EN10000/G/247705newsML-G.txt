a report into Australia &apos;s quarantine system released on Tuesday recommended that Australia share the responsibility for quarantine control between industry , the government and general public . 
pressures from world trade , tourism and international obligations demanded distribution of the responsibility , the report by academic Malcolm Nairn said . 
the report , commissioned by the previous Labor government , said Australia had a relatively pest and disease-free record and that shared responsibility was essential for Australia to achieve international credibility . 
&quot; This can most effectively be accomplished by a structural change of the Australian quarantine Inspection Service ( AQIS ) to locate the quarantine service and policy functions in a separate statutory authority to be known as quarantine Australia , &quot; the report said . 
quarantine Australia would assume all the functions and responsibiities of AQIS , except for meat inspection , it said . 
it also recommended Australia increase its monitoring of the plant instead of animal sector . 
&quot; examination of incursions into Australia over the past 25 years reveals that the rate of plant pests and diseases was about 10 times more than for animals . 
the formation of an Australian Plant Health Council would help plant industries achieve a higher status . 
it was also important to keep diseases and pests offshore , as well as focussing on monitoring and surveillance within Australia . 
&quot; In the past , quarantine has tended to focus on a border or barrier approach . 
primary Industries Minister John Anderson said the new approach to quarantine involving offshore , border and post border measures would support and reinforce the others . 
&quot; The government was committed to maintaining a conservative quarantine policy to safeguard human , animal and plant health in Australia , &quot; Anderson told reporters . 
he said the report , which detailed 109 recommendations , countered beliefs that Australia could adopt a no-risk policy . 
&quot; The report says such a quarantine policy would in practice be untenable and totally impractical , &quot; Anderson said . 
&quot; Australia &apos;s quarantine policy is not , and cannot be , one of zero risk , &quot; he said .
