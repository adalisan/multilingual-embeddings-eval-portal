Polish markets are expected to sail calmer waters next week after the central bank shook-up markets this week by signalling a tightening of monetary policy for the future , analysts said on Friday . 
the market will also keep a keen eye on potentially flammable political developments in Russia , whose fall-out could increase the risk of investing in neighbouring Central European countries such as Poland . 
&quot; Russian events influence Polish markets , despite the fact that our economies and political systems are independent , because investors often have a regional perspective , &quot; said Bartlomiej Kumela , senior dealer at Societe Generale in Warsaw . 
analysts said banks may bid for better yields at Monday &apos;s 900 million zloty primary T-bill auction after the central bank signalled on Friday that official interest rates would not be changed for the next six months . 
they said many banks rejuvenated their T-bill portfollios when foreign investors sold paper following the central bank &apos;s statement that it intended to keep the zloty devaluation factor frozen at one percent per month until late 1997 . 
&quot; It remains to be seen whether the treasury accepts much lower prices ... but many may make a bet on it because they have renewed porfolios this week thanks to exiting foreign investors , &quot; said one foreign bank dealer here . 
foreigners sold an estimated $ 40 to $ 60 million worth of T-bills on Thursday , but some analysts said that their pullout was also fuelled by uncertainty over Russian President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s sacking of security chief Alexander Lebed . 
at Monday &apos;s tender , the average yield of the 13-week T-bill was seen rising to 18.65 percent from this week &apos;s 18.55 , while the 26-week yield was seen at 19.15 percent from 19.11 . 
Hovever , large demand for the benchmark 52-week paper would likely keep the yield flat at 19.43 percent , analysts said . 
the zloty is likely to edge upward against the basket of five Western currencies next week unless foreign investors again sell Polish treasuries and knock it down , analyst said . 
&quot; The zloty may head back up in the region of two percent from the parity rate next week , &quot; said Tomasz Nowakowski of Bank Handlowy SA . 
analysts said the zloty , which closed the week at about 1.76 percent from the trading band centre , tends to strengthen against the basket when turnover is light . 
&quot; If nothing is happening on the market , then the zloty has a tendency to gain as interest on zloty deposits is more attractive , &quot; said Jaroslaw Dryjski of Bank Slaski SA . 
analysts said one-day deposit rates on money market should remain around the central bank &apos;s main 14-day drainage rate , last at 19.14 percent , for most of next week . 
they said banks had balanced reserve positions going into the weekend , but some said monthly tax payments could push rates higher early next week .
