German shares on Thursday pared losses to end bourse trade largely flat as the dollar recovered earlier weakness to trade above the crucial 1.50 mark level . 
the DAX index of 30 shares ended 2.16 points , a bare 0.08 percent down at 2,772.34 , as dealers said a recovery in the newly-floated shares of telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom had also been positive for the market . 
shares were largely unmoved after a widely expected decision by the German Bundesbank to keep interest rates unchanged . 
the DAX had earlier touched a low of 2,760.33 in response to the dollar falling underneath 1.50 marks in late Wednesday trade after floor shares trade had closed . 
but dealers said any impetus to sell had been counter-balanced by a strong overnight performance on Wall Street . 
&quot; The Street was good , the weaker dollar is bad , so that comes out as pretty neutral , &quot; said one trader . 
the dollar later recovered slightly to trade at 1.5022 / 27 marks . 
volumes were generally thin , with interest even limited in newly-floated Deutsche Telekom shares , with just under three million shares changing hands in bourse dealings , significantly less than in previous days . 
Telekom was slightly firmer than the rest of the market , adding 35 pfennigs to close at 32.15 pfennigs , with dealers saying profit-taking on the stock was petering out . 
shares in industrial group Daimler-Benz AG were also firmer , gaining 27 pfennigs to 97.07 marks , after interest in the company following an interview with the company &apos;s chairman in a German business magazine . 
chairman Juergen Schrempp said he expected 1996 group sales growth of 10 to 11 percent . 
shares in electronics firm Siemens AG rose 38 pfennigs at 72.25 marks , after the company announced a rise in 1995 / 96 after-tax profit of 29 million marks , but later fell back to close nine pfennigs off at 71.78 . 
steel manufacturer Thyssen was weaker than the rest of the market , slipping 5.50 marks to 278 marks , with dealers saying some players were worried ahead of the firm &apos;s publication of 1995 / 96 results on Friday . 
the stock had recently been climbing on speculation that the firm would soon restructure .
