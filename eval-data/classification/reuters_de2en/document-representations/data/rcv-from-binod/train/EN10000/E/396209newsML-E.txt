Shanghai people are among the richest in China , earning more than twice the average of their compatriots elsewhere , and many say they have the economic reform policies of Deng Xiaoping to thank . 
&quot; We Shanghai people care about money , we leave the politics to Beijing , &quot; an old man tossing coins to the gods at Shanghai &apos;s Jing An Buddhist Temple said on Saturday . 
it &apos;s a refrain heard daily in China &apos;s biggest city and its economic heartland . 
with the death on Wednesday of paramount leader Deng at age 92 , Shanghai people are now reflecting on the source of their good fortune . 
&quot; If he hadn &apos;t opened up the country , we wouldn &apos;t have such nice restaurants to eat in , &quot; said a university economics student , gesturing through the window of a swanky Shanghai eatery . 
&quot; And we wouldn &apos;t have such nice clothes to buy and wear , &quot; she continued , smoothing down her grey wool Tweed jacket . 
&quot; We could all still be wearing those blue cotton Mao suits . 
indeed , until recently Shanghai was not allowed to hold onto much of the wealth generated by its 14 million people . 
between 1949 and 1983 , 87 percent of city revenues were remitted to central government coffers in Beijing . 
throughout that period Shanghai attracted little foreign interest or investment . 
but things changed in April 1990 with the launch of the Pudong New Area as China &apos;s premier economic development zone . 
Pudong , formerly swampland across the Huangpu River from Shanghai &apos;s famous waterfront Bund , set a new course for the city &apos;s fortunes . 
the past seven years have seen Pudong transformed into a forest of gleaming , towering office blocks and apartment houses . 
city officials now hope that Shanghai , already China &apos;s national financial centre , will become an Asian financial hub in the early years of the next millennium and eventually a global financial centre . 
foreign banks , told that if they wanted to do local currency business in Shanghai they had to move to Pudong , have begun the exodus -- Citibank last week became the first of eight foreign banks approved for Chinese yuan business to open a full branch office in Pudong . 
Pudong has been congratulated for Shanghai &apos;s success in attracting foreign investment . 
city officials have said foreign investment in Pudong should hit $ 25 billion a year by 2000 , accounting for 50 percent of the zone &apos;s gross domestic product ( GDP ) . 
annual foreign investment pledged to projects in Shanghai as a whole has topped $ 10 billion for each of the past three years , and rose a year-on-year five percent in 1996 to $ 11 billion . 
funds actually invested in projects in Shanghai last year totalled $ 4.7 billion , up 44.6 percent on 1995 . 
the roll-on effects of this capital inflow can be seen every day on Shanghai &apos;s streets as official figures show Shanghainese to be among the richest of China &apos;s 1.2 billion people . 
the average annual income of Shanghai &apos;s urban residents in 1996 was 10,572 yuan ( $ 1,273 ) , a rise of four percent on the year before and a good deal more than the national average of 4,380 yuan , official figures show . 
rural residents of Shanghai are also doing much better than those in the rest of the country . 
figures released recently by the Shanghai municipal authorities show the average annual income of local rural households was 4,846 yuan in 1996 , a rise of 4.5 percent on the 1995 figure . 
compare this to official figures showing the average rural income throughout China last year was just 1,900 yuan ( $ 228 ) .
