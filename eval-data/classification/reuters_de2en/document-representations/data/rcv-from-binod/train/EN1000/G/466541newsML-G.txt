a forecast calling for warmer spring weather sent chills Tuesday through parts of South Dakota where a massive , melting snowpack was expected to unleash floods still impossible to gauge . 
&quot; We know we &apos;re going to get a flood , &quot; Jim Sawyer , an aide to Gov. 
William Janklow said . 
&quot; We just don &apos;t know how big . 
residents along three winding rivers in the southeastern corner of the state may be caught in the guessing game for another two weeks or more . 
temperatures will go as high as the 60s later this week but cooler weather the past few days appears to have slowed the melting process to the north , where snow was still almost knee-deep , and eased the threat of a sudden flood . 
at Dell Rapids one victim-in-waiting was Marty Miller , an automobile upholstery specialist whose shop and home are just steps from the Big Sioux River . 
&quot; I &apos;m getting ready to wrap up the shop in plastic and sandbags and get out , &quot; Miller said . 
two vintage cars in his shop were in various stages of restoration . 
the Big Sioux at Dell Rapids may rise another seven feet in the next two weeks , the highest level since a record and disastrous 1969 flood that left water lapping at the eaves of the nearby white frame cottage that Miller moved into 12 years ago . 
there isn &apos;t a prettier spot than this in the summer . 
but not this spring , &quot; he said . 
some of Miller &apos;s neighbours have already piled sandbags against basement windows in a low-lying section of this town of 2,400 near the red sandstone dells of the Big Sioux , about 20 miles north of Sioux Falls . 
the rolling , brown farm fields nearby are dabbed with patches of slowly melting snow . 
&quot; There isn &apos;t much anyone can do , &quot; Mitch Adams , head of an emergency coordinating committee in Dell Rapids , said . 
he estimated that about 40 houses will suffer the worst damage , with a railroad embankment protecting most of the town . 
State officials have no firm estimate on how many homes and businesses might be at risk along the Big Sioux , Vermillion and James Rivers , all of which drain into the Missouri River . 
forecasters have said cool weather would bring a longer , lower flood while a quick warm-up would trigger a faster , higher one . 
a sudden heavy rainfall , not foreseen in any short-range forecasts , would make either scenario worse . 
at Sioux Falls , the most heavily populated city in the threatened region , the Big Sioux was roaring over the rocky cut that gave the city its name . 
local radio stations were appealing for volunteers to help fill sandbags and the city &apos;s Argus Leader newspaper published a special section Tuesday advising residents how to stay safe in high water areas . 
but city public works director Lyle Johnson said Monday recent cooler weather had led forecasters to scale back earlier predictions and experts now believe the flooding will not be as bad as it was in 1969 . 
officials have reinforced a levee system and believe only some outlying areas are at risk . 
the record snowfall along the North and South Dakota border and in nearby Minnesota -- collected in drifts as high as eight feet in some places -- was causing problems in two other drainage areas besides the upper Missouri basin . 
they include the headwaters region of the Minnesota River , which flows southeasterly , eventually into the Mississippi , and the Red River Valley , which runs northward out of North Dakota to Winnipeg and Hudson Bay .
