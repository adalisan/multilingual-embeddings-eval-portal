clinical finishing by midfielder Thorsten Fink , who scored twice , and South African striker Sean Dundee steered Karlsruhe to an impressive 3-0 home victory over Italy &apos;s Roma in the UEFA Cup second round on Tuesday . 
Fink gave the Germans the lead in injury time at the end of the first half with a brilliant glancing header past the right-hand post . 
in the 58th minute Dundee pounced at the left-hand post to fire in an excellent cross from the left from Michael Tarnat . 
the two scorers then combined for the third goal in the 75th minute . 
Dundee flicked the ball acrobatically to Fink in the penalty area and the midfielder struck the ball sweetly into the left-hand corner . 
the result left the Germans well in control for the second leg in Italy in two weeks . 
&quot; We put them under pressure right from the start and didn &apos;t let them come at us , &quot; Fink said . 
&quot; We wanted to show from the start that we were the favourites .
