the world Red Cross body said on Friday it was extremely concerned about worsening security in Rwanda where more than 80 people have been killed in recent days including three Spanish aid workers . 
&quot; Increasing violence comes at a time when the country &apos;s humanitarian needs were starting to be met , &quot; said Piero Calvi-Parisetti , a senior official of the Swiss-run IFRC , the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies . 
he said in a statement humanitarian aid was urgently needed to help Hutu refugees who returned home late in 1996 -- 650,000 fled home from east Zaire after Tutsi rebels overran their camps -- and another half a million who were expelled from Tanzania . 
&quot; The Federation is continuing to work in Rwanda , although it is extremely concerned about the deteriorating security situation , &quot; the IFRC statement said . 
residents and aid sources in Rwanda said the Tutsi-dominated army killed more than 50 civilians in a crackdown this week triggered by the slaying of three Spanish aid workers on Saturday night in the northwestern Ruhengeri region . 
Rwandan Vice-President Major-General Paul Kagame in Kigali told the BBC 80 people were killed in army search operations in Ruhengeri and civilians had been caught in crossfire . 
U.N. human rights monitors and local residents reported other violent incidents in the communes of Butaro , Kidaho , Kinigi , Nyamugali , Cyabingo , Nyakinama and Gatonde in Ruhengeri . 
at Runigi church , 12 km ( seven miles ) southwest of Ruhengeri , Father Samuel Nayigiziki said eight to 10 people were killed by unidentified gunmen in hills behind Nkuli village . 
he said parishioners reported possibly up to 50 civilians also killed at Nymutera , 10 km ( six miles ) south of Ruhengeri . 
on Thursday , the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was considering armed protection for its staff in Rwanda as part of new plans to boost security for its workers in conflict zones around the world .
