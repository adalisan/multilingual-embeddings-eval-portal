Natan Sharansky &apos;s image as a hero has lost some of its lustre in the year since he assumed a role in Israel &apos;s corridors of power . 
political life has proved a challenge for Sharansky , a Jewish dissident who battled the Soviet Union during nine years behind bars before realising his dream of settling in Israel . 
&quot; I have to tell you frankly that to be part of the establishment is much less fun than to fight the establishment , &quot; said Sharansky , the 49-year-old industry and trade minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s cabinet . 
buoyed by hundreds of thousands of immigrants from the former Soviet Union , Sharansky &apos;s party came out of nowhere in elections a year ago with the clout to make or break Netanyahu &apos;s government . 
in his biggest test so far , Sharansky came under pressure from politicians on all sides both to topple Netanyahu and to prop him up over a corruption scandal . 
at first Sharansky threatened to quit if even 10 percent of the influence-peddling allegations proved true . 
but when prosecutors found insufficient evidence to put Netanyahu on trial , Sharansky stayed put . 
&quot; The police report on the appointment was very serious , &quot; he said in an interview at his Jerusalem office . 
&quot; At the same time there is all the difference in the world between being suspected and between being accused . 
Sharansky has won high marks for making ministry appointments on a professional rather than a political basis . 
he co-chairs a committee on government appointments he forced Netanyahu to set up because of the corruption scandal . 
his Yisrael ba-Aliya ( Israel of Immigration ) party has given an official voice to the one of every six Israelis who hail from the former Soviet Union , most of them arriving in a wave of immigration since Moscow flung open the doors in 1989 . 
but a Gallup poll of Israelis for the newspaper Maariv ranked Sharansky 13th among the 18 cabinet ministers a year into office . 
he scored a grade of 5.37 on a 10-point scale but still came in two places ahead of Netanyahu . 
a former employer , Jerusalem Report editor Hirsh Goodman , wrote a column in May calling Sharansky &quot; just another cheap politician &quot; intent only on personal political survival . 
it was a far cry from the hero &apos;s welcome that greeted Sharansky on his arrival in 1986 at the end of his Gulag ordeal . 
the contrast has not been lost on Sharansky , who said : &quot; Sometimes it &apos;s by far more difficult to say what is right and what is wrong than it was 20 years ago in prison . 
even as Sharansky grapples with the everyday problems of Israeli politics , he surrounds himself with trappings that remind him of his earlier struggle . 
he has shunned the coat and tie of most politicians , explaining : &quot; Since I went out of prison , I am in constant struggle not to be imprisoned by the rules of the free world . 
for years he has donned an Israeli army cap , once a symbol of his dissident struggle and now a way of avoiding being typecast in a country that defines a man &apos;s Jewish religious convictions by the colour and fabric of the skullcap he wears . 
that said , he regards himself as religious and carries with him a Book of Psalms at all times -- a memento of his time in prisons and work camps . 
mounted on the wall of Sharansky &apos;s office is a prized photo of his late friend Andrei Sakharov , the father of the Soviet hydrogen bomb who was internally exiled for criticising the Kremlin &apos;s human rights abuses . 
Sharansky said it was no coincidence that pictures of Netanyahu and Israeli President Ezer Weizman hung on the wall directly opposite Sakharov &apos;s photo . 
he explained : 
&quot; For Sakharov there was never any distance between what he sought and what he said and I think that every person -- especially a politician -- should learn a lot from Sakharov . 
Sharansky &apos;s wife Avital campaigned for years the world over until his release in an East-West prisoner swap . 
she knocked on the doors of the powerful and called journalists day and night on behalf of her &quot; Anatoly &quot; , as he was known before moving to Israel and taking a Hebrew name . 
now she avoids the political spotlight . 
&quot; Avital is not a public person and that &apos;s why all these years that she forced herself to be in public , to give press conferences , to lead demonstrations , to meet the leaders of the world , she really suffered , &quot; Sharansky said . 
&quot; The moment that I was released , she started doing what she really always wanted and enjoyed -- bringing up kids , making important decisions about their school , and volunteering to help the new immigrants and other people . 
Sharansky said he sensed that Avital , a devout Jew who waited 12 years to be reunited with him , would like him to study all day in a religious seminary . 
but for now he has other ideas . 
&quot; The problem was always my desire to change things , to influence , to move ahead , to change the world , &quot; he said . 
on the peacemaking front Sharansky , having fought for his freedom , said he could relate to Palestinian demands for rights . 
but he said there was a difference between being a rights activist and turning to violence . 
&quot; I definitely think that they should have all the rights in the world except the right and the opportunity to destroy us , &quot; he said . 
Sharansky said he would stay in the government so long as he believed he could positively influence its work , ensure an end to scandals and help to pursue peace , economic development and a better social life . 
&quot; The moment I will feel that it becomes only an illusion , the moment I feel that I don &apos;t have real influence and that the same type of scandals which were in the past have a chance to happen again , I will not stay in the government even one day .
