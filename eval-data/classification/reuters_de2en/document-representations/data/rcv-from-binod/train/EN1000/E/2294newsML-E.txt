shoppers are loading up this year on perennial back-to-school favourites such as jeans , shirts and sneakers , with parents spending an average of 12 percent more for clothing and other supplies . 
&quot; It &apos;s sort of funny because it really hasn &apos;t changed a lot from years ago , with jeans , shirts and pants and things like that being the basics of what people are looking for , &quot; said Andrea Kent , director of the Retail Marketing Group for American Express Travel Related Services Inc . 
overall , back-to-school spending will rise a projected 12 percent to an average of $ 363 per child , American Express said in its second annual survey of 1,000 shoppers . 
the spending increase was caused by an emphasis on brand-name goods that typically cost more , lower retailer inventories which reduce the amount of discounted , sale merchandise , and higher consumer confidence , American Express said . 
it added that 18 percent of parents say they planned to spend $ 500 or more per child on back-to-school items such as clothing , supplies , textbooks and electronics . 
across the board , clothing accounts for the highest portion of the back-to-school budget . 
the percentage is highest for elementary students , at 66 percent of the budget , and high school students , at 63 percent . 
for college students , clothing accounts for 33 percent of the budget , followed closely behind by textbooks at 25 percent . 
&quot; College students have a much greater demand for other items ... textbooks is a very high expense for college students , accounting for 25 percent of their back-to-school budget , &quot; Kent said . 
curiously , the American Express survey found that college boys are dramatically more style-conscious than college girls , a finding that was contrary to last year &apos;s results . 
among the retailers , department stores are battling speciality shops for back-to-school sales , with discount department stores getting a large portion of the sales . 
Back-to-school -- the second largest selling season for retailers -- has taken on even more importance since the all-important holiday season between thanksgiving and Christmas is five days shorter this year . 
&quot; The department stores are back with a bang ... 
they are fighting for the purse , hearts and minds of the mall-brats , and they are flexing their fashion muscles , &quot; said Alan Millstein , president of Fashion Network Inc . , a New York-based retail consultant . 
the American Express survey showed discount department stores are capturing 35 percent of sales , followed by malls at 29 percent and department stores at 26 percent . 
other retail locations , such as factory outlets and office supply stores , accounted for 10 percent . 
the decision of where to shop is mostly left up to parents , the survey revealed , while the children had the most influence over what to buy . 
&quot; If you let your kids pick out what ... to buy , they are more likely to want to wear it , &quot; Kent said . 
&quot; Back when I was a kid , my mom took me shopping and she picked out what she liked for me . 
what kids are picking out are jeans , with the Levi Strauss &amp; Co . &apos; s Levi brand being the most popular , Kent added . 
jeans are also an important draw for department stores trying to lure high school and college students , with offerings that include designer jeans from Tommy Hilfiger , Ralph Lauren Polo and Calvin Klein . 
Millstein added that low-slung , hip-hugging jeans with bell bottoms are big sellers . 
&quot; Anything that has a ... retro look of the peace march is back in fashion and selling , &quot; Millstein said . 
among the hot-selling items at Target , the discount department store chain owned by Dayton Hudson Corp. , are T-shirts and accessories , such as clay rings and necklaces , that are reminiscent of the 1970s , according to Dayton Hudson spokeswoman Susan Eich . 
other popular items include jumper &apos;s for girls , backpacks , clogs and &quot; anything with zippers , &quot; Eich added .
