Mexico will take advantage of a light schedule of maturing debt in 1997 to try to make placements to cover debt coming due in 1998 and 1999 , Martin Werner , director of public credit for the Mexican Finance Ministry , said on Friday . 
&quot; If the liquidity in markets allows us , we could place a little more -- but in no way the amounts that we placed this year -- but a little more to pre-finance some maturing debt for 1998 and 1999 , &quot; Werner told a conference of the Mexican Institute of Financial executives . 
&quot; The small amount of debt placements in the markets that we have to make to finance maturing debt in 1997 will allow us to make additional placements . 
this will allow us to pre-pay or to anticipate debt maturing in 1998 and 1999 , &quot; he said . 
Mexico had debt worth $ 16.0 billion coming due in 1996 , but that number falls to $ 9.0 billion in 1997 , of which only $ 1.4 billion is market debt of the federal government . 
Mexico has a heavier debt repayment schedule in 1998 and 1999 , particularly with debt owed to multilateral organizations . 
Werner said that the aim of the government in 1995 had been to eliminate the large amounts of short-term debt outstanding , and to allow Mexico to return to international capital markets . 
this year the government has aimed , among other things , to refinance the emergency funding that came from the U.S. government and multilateral organizations during the peso crisis . 
the government is now also aiming to ensure that the public sector continues to have good access to credit markets , and to build benchmarks across the yield curve , Werner said . 
&quot; The federal government , as the leader in placing debt , must construct a yield curve and help facilitate placements by the rest of the public sector and the private sector , &quot; Werner said . 
he noted that in 1996 markets welcomed Mexican debt as the economy was stabilizing , and investors were seeking higher yields . 
&quot; For reasons both internal and external , the year 1996 was a favorable year to place debt in the markets , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There was a lot of interest in investing in Mexico , and at the same time the liquidity in international markets was very good , both in the United States as in Asia and Europe , &quot; he said .
