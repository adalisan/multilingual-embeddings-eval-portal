the International Monetary Fund has had its first contact with the new Democratic Republic of the Congo but no date has yet been set for future talks , international monetary sources said on Wednesday . 
the sources said an IMF mission had left the country , which used to be called Zaire and is now run by President Laurent Kabila , at the weekend . 
&quot; The aim of the visit was to establish contact with the new government and review the situation , &quot; said one . 
&quot; It was also to pave the way for the resumption of a comprehensive dialogue with the authorities at a mutually convenient date . 
IMF officials have said future assistance could start with technical aid because both sides must work out what to do about arrears built up under the administration of Mobuto Sese Seko before loans could be offered .
