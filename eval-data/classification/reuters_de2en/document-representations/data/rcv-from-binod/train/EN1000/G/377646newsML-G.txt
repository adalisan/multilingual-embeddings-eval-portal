the women &apos;s combined downhill at the Alpine skiing world championships was delayed by one hour to 1000 GMT on Friday because of the weather . 
the latest delay was due to wind and to snow , which began falling overnight and dumped several centimetres on the piste . 
the race was called off on Thursday due to wind . 
the race jury were inspecting the piste at 0900 but the conditions made it likely that they would either order a further delay or abandon any attempt at racing on Friday . 
the slalom leg of the combined was held on Thursday night . 
Italy &apos;s Morena Gallizio was the fastest in that .
