Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has not yet appointed a U.N. official to a committee on missing persons in Cyprus because the leaders of the island &apos;s two communities have yet to complete steps he asked them to take last April , a U.N. source said on Friday . 
the three-member committee , established in 1981 , comprises one representative each named by the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots and a third nominated by the United Nations . 
the last U.N. representative , Paul Wurth , a Swiss national , resigned earlier this year and a deputy has since been acting in his place . 
the committee has been probing the fate of some 1,500 Greek Cypriots missing since 1974 , when Turkish troops intervened on the island after a brief coup in Nicosia engineered by the military junta then ruling Greece . 
it has also been studying the cases of some 500 missing Turkish Cypriots dating from 1974 as well as from inter-communal violence in the 1960s . 
the U.N. source said Boutros-Ghali wrote to President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in April asking them to reach agreement on certain issues before he would appoint a successor to Wurth . 
the issues relate to the definition of categories of cases of missing persons submitted by the two sides ; the sequence in which the investigation of those categories would be carried out ; the priority to be accorded to those categories of cases which could be concluded most expeditiously ; and the expeditious collection of information about cases where there were no known witnesses . 
the secretary-general had told the two Cypriot leaders they should be able to reach agreement on these matters by the end of June . 
but since they had still not done so , the appointment of a successor to Wurth has been delayed , the source added . 
Cypriot sources said Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides discussed the matter with the secretary-general while in New York last month for the U.N. General Assembly .
