Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh met cabinet and military officials on Tuesday to discuss a Saudi proposal for settlement of a 61-year border dispute , an official said . 
Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef was in Yemen at the weekend on his second visit this month to resolve the row , which has led to several minor armed clashes between the Arab world &apos;s richest oil power and one of its most impoverished countries . 
&quot; During the meeting , the president reviewed the outcome of his talks with Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef , &quot; the official told Reuters . 
he said the president discussed with officials a letter from Saudi King Fahd delivered by Prince Nayef which outlined the monarch &apos;s proposal for a resolution of the border issue . 
the official said a response to the letter would be formulated in the coming weeks and would then be delivered to Saudi Arabia by a special envoy . 
at the end of Prince Nayef &apos;s latest visit to Sanaa on Sunday , Saleh said : &quot; The gap between Yemen and Saudi Arabia has been narrowed to a great extent .
