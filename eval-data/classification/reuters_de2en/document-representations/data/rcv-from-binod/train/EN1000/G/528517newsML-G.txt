France will hold an early two-stage parliamentary election on May 25 and June 1 , ahead of the scheduled March 1998 date . 
the following is a summary of the main issues so far . 
French President Jacques Chirac said he wanted an early vote to allow French people a say on the speed and scale of economic reform and put France in a strong position in negotiations on Europe ahead on the launch of a single currency 
financial market analysts give following additional reasons 
-- it will make it easier to push through new austerity measures , likely in the 1998 budget due in the autumn . 
these are likely to be needed to ensure France meets the Maastricht criteria for EMU entry . 
-- assuming the centre-right coalition returns to power , Chirac will have a &quot; friendly &quot; parliament until end of his term in 2002 , allowing him to push through economic reforms 
-- it limits potential damage from judicial inquiries into party financing by allowing Chirac to drop some ministers 
-- general feeling among analysts is ruling centre-right coalition , which has strict whip majority of 464 of National Assembly &apos;s 577 seats , will probably win with slimmer majority . 
-- but some say the result will be very close , pointing to narrow 51 percent victory in Maastricht referendum in 1992 , chances of protest vote against unpopular Prime Minister Alain Juppe , worries about record 12.8 percent unemployment . 
-- Sofres opinion poll published on Monday suggested centre-right would keep majority but could lose about 150 seats 
-- beyond saying uncertainty and a sell-off in the short term , the picture is somewhat unclear . 
market generally expects centre-right coalition to win , paving the way for more market-friendly reforms and spending curbs , but is on defensive against any opinion polls suggesting Socialist victory . 
-- PIBOR interest rate futures , where foreign investors have been most active , likely to see the most volatility . 
-- Franc will continue to suffer , although dramatic slide is not being countenanced for now . 
remains vulnerable but can be supported by central bank with healthy German mark reserves . 
Bank of France seen supporting franc through intervention , unlikely to raise official interest rates . 
-- Long-term government debt should hold up relatively well given most bonds held by domestic investors . 
-- views diverge on stock market risks , some saying it will suffer as long as uncertainty lasts ; others saying dip could be stemmed by prospect of more &quot; liberal &quot; centre-right return . 
-- Both left and right main political groupings committed to launching single euro currency , though Socialist party leader Lionel Jospin has said he is not prepared to impose new bout of austerity to meet strict interpretation of Maastricht criteria . 
-- Socialist party says Italy , Spain and Portugal must be in EMU from the start . 
centre-right coalition has no clear position on these countries , saying must await EU decision in 1998 
-- Prime Minister Alain Juppe pledged on Tuesday to roll back the state and press ahead with tax and spending cuts . 
he stressed continuation of policies rather than radical change and sought to unite all wings of the centre-right coalition behind him . 
but there would be no 1980s style &quot; hyperliberalism . 
he reaffirmed France &apos;s commitment to launching a single European currency on time in 1999 , saying the new euro must be an equal footing with the dollar and the yen . 
-- New austerity measures expected in 1998 budget , under a Juppe government , while Socialist party has said it is against another round of belt-tightening . 
-- Room for manoeuvre for any government limited by need to prevent new rise in state deficit , a need recognised by both parties not just to meet monetary union entry requirements but also to head off risk of big debt repayments in future . 
both main political groupings therefore seeking policies that will boost growth and bring down record unemployment , without big increases in public spending . 
-- Socialist party wants to fuel demand via regulated , non-inflationary wage rises , cutting working week without reducing pay and through job creation schemes . 
government says its public spending cuts and tax reductions will boost business confidence , leave way clear for low interest rates , and pave the way for more investment , growth and jobs . 
-- Some economists say more &quot; free-market &quot; politicians , like former finance minister Alain Madelin , may be brought into a new right-wing government . 
-- partial privatisation of France Telecom , due in May , delayed by four weeks , government says timetable for sale of defence electronics group Thomson-CSF , for which final bids due May 7 , unaffected . 
-- Socialist party may try to halt new privatisations , including sale of France Telecom .
