Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has fallen to the lowest approval rating in his more than four years as one of the post-Communist world &apos;s most praised reformers , an opinion poll showed on Thursday . 
on the day his Civic Democratic Party ( ODS ) unveiled a kinder , gentler approach to November Senate elections , Klaus saw his approval drop to 44 percent from 49 percent in the same survey conducted in June by the state research group IVVM . 
the sample of 1,461 citizens from September 2-9 , was taken before last week &apos;s political battle over one bank &apos;s failure and severe liquidity problems at the largest fully-private bank forced Klaus to accept a parliamentary probe into the sector . 
at the height of his popularity after becoming prime minister in 1992 , the unabashed monetarist Klaus had 65 percent approval according to IVVM , but he recently struggled with his party to win a second-term . 
the new survey comes as ODS tries to recover from June elections where Klaus and his three-party conservative coalition lost its parliamentary majority after a strong second-placing by the centre-left Social Democrats ( CSSD ) . 
the good news for Klaus is that CSSD chairman Milos Zeman -- Klaus &apos;s political arch enemy who became chairman of the lower house in a deal allowing the coalition to form a minority government -- lost even more of the public &apos;s trust . 
the survey showed Zeman &apos;s approval rating falling to 43 percent from 49 percent immediately after the June elections . 
Zeman has led a barrage of criticism against Klaus &apos;s government and its supervision over banks and capital markets , alledging widespread corruption , and tax evasion . 
&quot; Both of these men are highly visible , especially now Zeman , which wasn &apos;t the case for him before the elections , &quot; Patria Finance vice-chairman Jan Vlachy told Reuters . 
recent polls on party preference show ODS and CSSD neck and neck although the Senate elections will be contested in individual constiutencies and not on a straight party ticket . 
the Czech economy is growing by more than four percent per year with three percent unemployment . 
but a balooning trade deficit , inflation stuck at over nine percent , a stagnant housing market , and a troubled health care system has taken its toll on public opinion . 
almost all top politicians lost ground in the latest IVVM survey with the notable exception of President Vaclav Havel , once the dissident playwright who now remains above the fray of partisan politics . 
Havel tied his four-year high of 76 percent approval , while Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy , from a junior coalition party , and Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec of ODS were the only other politicians rating more 50 percent . 
finance minister and ODS vice-chairman Ivan Kocarnik , who has survived calls for his dismissal by the opposition because of the banking row , suffered the largest drop in approval in the survey , falling to 32 percent from 44 percent . 
Klaus &apos;s ODS on Thursday appeared to respond to research showing that the party , which still topped the June election with just over 29 percent , was losing touch with older , less educated and poorer voters . 
ODS unveiled an advertisement for mid-November Senate elections showing a grinning Klaus with the slogan : &quot; The worries of proper citizens are our worries &quot; . 
&quot; ODS is willing to show it understands the problems of ordinary life , &quot; party vice-chairman Zieleniec told reporters .
