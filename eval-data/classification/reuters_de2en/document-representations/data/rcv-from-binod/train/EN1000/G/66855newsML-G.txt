new decrees will determine to the minute when Boris Yeltsin hands power over to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin during the Russian president &apos;s heart bypass operation , Interfax news agency said on Friday . 
the agency , quoting Kremlin sources , said decrees on the temporary handover of power to Chernomyrdin and on Yeltsin &apos;s full resumption of his duties had already been drafted . 
&quot; The decree not only gives the exact day of the month , but even the hour and the minute at which the premier gets his temporary responsibilities , &quot; Interfax said . 
a decree published on Thursday confirmed that Yeltsin , 65 , would hand over power to Chernomyrdin during the surgery and that the prime minister would have temporary control over the button which could launch a nuclear strike . 
but further decrees will be needed -- one to hand over power and another to take it back when Yeltsin recovers from the anaesthetic . 
Interfax said it was possible that Yeltsin would hand over power for only a few hours . 
&quot; The structure of the three decrees gives the head of the Russian state the possibility to decide for himself on all these questions and links decisions of this kind to him alone , &quot; Interfax said . 
Yeltsin has been in hospital for the last week and aides say he is having tests before the operation . 
the doctors are due to meet on September 25 to fix the date of the surgery .
