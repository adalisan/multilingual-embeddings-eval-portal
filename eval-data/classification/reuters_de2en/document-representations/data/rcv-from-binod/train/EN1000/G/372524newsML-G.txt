layers of sediment collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Florida suggest that a massive meteorite struck the earth 65 million years ago and led to the extinction of dinosaurs , scientists said on Wednesday . 
sediment cores collected by an international team of scientists aboard the JOIDES Resolution drilling ship indicate that 70 to 80 percent of the Earth &apos;s species were killed in the collision , they said . 
the cores contain &quot; a really beautifully preserved record of what the oceans were like in the distant past , &quot; Dr. Richard Norris , a paleontologist from the Woods Hold oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts told Reuters from the vessel . 
&quot; We can go back and look in the distant past and look at the oceans and the climate and the kinds of organisms that were alive at that time , what they were really like , &quot; he said . 
JOIDES , the Joint oceanographic Institutions for Deep Earth sampling , is funded by 20 countries and is managed by Joint oceanographic Institutions Inc , a non-profit group of 10 major U.S. oceanographic institutes . 
scientists theorise that the impact of the six-mile ( 10-km ) -wide Meteor caused dust and gases and other materials to be spewed into the atmosphere , blocking out the sun and killing off micro-organisms , setting off a chain reaction . 
the blast is dated at about the same time the dinosaurs died out . 
drilling 10,000 feet ( 3,000 metres ) under water , about 240 miles ( 386 kilometres ) east of Florida , the scientists found green clay pellets which they said were fragments of glass thrown into the atmosphere when the meteorite hit . 
sharply differentiated layers of mud and clay , which could mark the periods before and after the collision , contained different kinds of microscopic plants and animals -- including some which are the predecessors of today &apos;s micro-organisms , Norris said . 
shallower sediment from 35 to 45 million years ago , when the world was much warmer , may provide clues of what would happen if the Greenhouse Effect takes place , he said . 
&quot; We would like to know what the world would be like if we keep on pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and create our own little greenhouse , &quot; he said .
