total direct foreign investment in Romania since the 1989 end of communist rule amounted to $ 2.16 billion at the end of November , the Romanian Development Agency ( ARD ) said on Tuesday . 
the ARD , the main investment promoter , said the largest single investor was Daewoo Heavy Industries Ltd . 
the South Korean company put over $ 200 million into a car maker -- which it plans to expand further on $ 1.0 billion investment by the year 2000 -- and a Black Sea shipyard . 
foreign investment , now low in comparison with levels in other Eastern and Central European countries , is expected to pick up in the future as the new reformist government has pledged to boost facilities for foreign investors . 
centrist Democratic Convention won parliamentary polls in November and a new government which it formed with Social Democrats and representatives of ethnic Hungarians in Romania is to be approved by parliament on Wednesday . 
analysts say the new government will have to step up restructuring of industry and privatisation , cut taxes , secure a smooth run of the foreign exchange market and work out a law for portfolio investors with a view to stimulating foreign investment .
