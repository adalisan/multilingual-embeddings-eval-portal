September gilt futures may be approaching their top and will likely drift back on Thursday to target 113-16,17 congestion , technical analysts said . 
&quot; I think gilts are getting towards the top of the range , &quot; said Marc Ostwald , technical analyst at London Bond Broking . 
&quot; We do have an opportunity if the market starts better to look at 114-04,05 congestion but I &apos;ve got serious doubts about whether we can push up through there . 
the market stalled at 114-04 on Wednesday and at 114-05 on June 18 . 
September gilts opened down 3 / 32 at 113-27 . 
Ostwald said a lack of significant buying in the underlying cash market was not helping the futures . 
&quot; But if it were to push through the 114-04,05 area , next resistance is at 114-16,18 , &quot; said Ostwald . 
daily charts show the market hit a high of 114-16 on June 16 and 114-18 on June 17 . 
Ostwald put good support at 113-25,26 , but added the market might drift back as far as congestion at 113-16,17 . 
&quot; That &apos;s the more likely scenario short term , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I can &apos;t see it trading outside its 112-25 to 114-05 range ahead of the budget next week . 
Juliette Clark , senior treasury manager at the Royal Bank of Scotland , said while the longer term technical picture for gilts was still bullish , they might struggle initially on Thursday and establish a trading range between 113-22 and 113-31 . 
&quot; A break of this range will eventually occur ... and this should be on the upside , &quot; she said in a note . 
she said things would improve once September hurdled 113-31 , giving it the potential to pierce 114-05 . 
&quot; There should be scope for gains today as attention turns towards the 114-24 high ( on continuation charts ) , but the market must first negotiate the volatility barrier at 114-12 , &quot; she said .
