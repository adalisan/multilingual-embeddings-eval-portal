former England midfielder John Barnes ended his 10-year association with Liverpool on Wednesday when he joined Newcastle United on a free transfer . 
the club &apos;s board announced through the London Stock Exchange he had signed a two-year contract . 
Barnes enjoyed a decade of succes when Kenny Dalglish , then the Liverpool manager , bought him from Watford in 1987 . 
he became an integral member of the side which won the league championship in 1988 and 1990 as well as the F.A. 
Cup in 1989 and then , after Dalglish had left , the League Cup in 1995 . 
he was also a regular in the England set-up , winning 79 caps and scoring 11 goals . 
his first appearance was in 1983 when he came on as a substitute against Northern Ireland and his last was against Colombia last year . 
however , the close season signings of Paul INCE , Danny Murphy and Oyvind Leonhardsen have squeezed him out of the Liverpool first team and the speed with which his request for a free transfer was granted suggested that manager Roy Evans no longer saw him as an important member of his squad . 
the early favourites to land his signature were West Ham United with whom he verbally agreed terms . 
but when Dalglish , now in charge at Newcastle , came into the frame Barnes swiftly changed his mind . 
the deal gives him the chance not only of challenging for a third championship medal but also the opportunity of playing in the European Cup if Newcastle beat their preliminary round opponents Croatia Zagreb .
