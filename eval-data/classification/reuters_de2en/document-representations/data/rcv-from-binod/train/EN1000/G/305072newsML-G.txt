Swiss teenager Martina Hingis showed her frustration as she battled to defeat experienced German Barbara Rittner in the first round of the Australian Open on Tuesday . 
fourth seed Hingis , 16 , regarded as the main threat to world number one Steffi Graf over the next two weeks at Melbourne Park , was handed a warning for racquet abuse before winning 6-1 7-5 on centre court . 
Slovakian-born Hingis strolled through the first set before Rittner lifted her game in a see-sawing second set in which most of the games went against serve . 
Hingis at one point trailed 1-4 but won 11 straight points to level the scores . 
down three break points in the 12th game , Hingis forced a string of errors from Rittner and slammed two forehand winners for match point . 
Rittner netted a backhand to give Hingis the match . 
Hingis has beaten both Graf and the injured world number two and 1996 Australian Open champion Monica Seles over the past year , and defeated Rittner in two sets in Hamburg last year .
