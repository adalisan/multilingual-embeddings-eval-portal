Prime Minister John Major urged Britain on Sunday not to be &quot; lulled into a false sense of security &quot; by a spate of suspected IRA bomb scares that have wreaked havoc but cost no lives . 
he said the Irish Republican Army , which is fighting to end British rule in northern Ireland , were clearly to blame for a bomb scare that wrecked Saturday &apos;s Grand National and that such actions would only hinder efforts to clinch a real peace . 
&quot; We &apos;ve now had two or three of these incidents in the last week , &quot; Major said of recent bomb scares across Britain . 
they have murdered before . 
they will murder again , and people ought not to take these threats lightly , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There &apos;s a great danger that people will be lulled into a false sense of security and then there will be a bomb , &quot; Major said on BBC television &apos;s breakfast with Frost show . 
security sources believe two bomb alerts on British motorways this week and the forced abandoning of the Grand National at Aintree fell into the pattern of past IRA strategy . 
major said he had &quot; no doubt &quot; the IRA was to blame for the Aintree scare , which left race-goers stranded and forced the abandonment of the best-known race in the sporting calendar . 
officials scoured the Liverpool race track on Sunday while in the capital , police were on their guard for similar threats at soccer &apos;s League Cup final at Wembley in north London . 
Middlesbrough play Leicester City in the high-profile game , with the stadium expected to be filled to its 80,000 capacity . 
&quot; We would appeal to everyone to keep a close eye out for anything dubious , &quot; said a Wembley spokesman . 
the spate of bomb warnings and disruptive hoaxes comes as Britain &apos;s politicians campaign for a May 1 election that the ruling Conservatives are widely tipped to lose . 
but Major said the stepped-up campaign -- which has closed busy highways and caused chaos at key train stations -- would not help the IRA &apos;s political allies , Sinn Fein , win a seat at peace talks . 
&quot; If the lunatic who dreamed this up believed it was going to get Sinn Fein into the talks earlier they were utterly wrong , &quot; said Major of the Aintree scare . 
&quot; It puts it back . 
it certainly doesn &apos;t put it forward . 
British politicians say Northern Ireland will remain part of Britain so long as a majority , which is currently pro-British and Protestant , want it to remain so . 
the IRA says the province is a colonial relic which should be ruled by Dublin .
