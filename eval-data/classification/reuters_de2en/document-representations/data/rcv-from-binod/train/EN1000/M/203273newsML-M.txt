CBOT soybean futures closed sharply higher on the back of a rally in wheat , with fund buying and bull spreading pushing the soy complex into a technical breakout , traders said . 
&quot; Everyone wanted to be easier this morning after yesterday &apos;s close but wheat took over plus the oats bullish consensus was down to 22 which was very oversold , &quot; said Mark Cermak of O &apos;Connor and Co . &quot; oats and wheat caught everyone in the corn and bean pits on the short side . 
soybeans rallied Monday , dropped Tuesday but sprang back convincingly Wednesday as the market prepared for export news . 
USDA at 0730 CST Thursday will release its updated weekly export sales report and sales of U.S. soybeans and soy products have been occurring at a rapid clip featuring China as a buyer . 
trader expectations were for the net export sales tally for soybeans in Thursday &apos;s USDA report to range from 500,000 to 700,000 tonnes . 
soybeans closed seven to 11-1 / 2 cents higher , with January up 11-1 / 2 at $ 7.07 per bushel . 
soybeans sagged early but came roaring back when wheat continued to march higher . 
traders said the rally Monday was pounced on by shorts Tuesday as cash soybean markets reached $ 7.00 per bushel in some locations . 
&quot; The basis in some areas got farmers $ 7.00 beans and there was some selling , &quot; a trader said . 
the weakness in the November during Tuesday &apos;s expiration also captured attention . 
&quot; There were 1.25 million bushels still open in the November ( early Wednesday ) so someone is going to deliver , &quot; the trader said . 
technicians awoke to what some said was a key breakout amid an outside day up . 
&quot; It was an outside day up and good . 
it was higher than yesterday &apos;s high and lower than yesterday &apos;s low and it closed higher which could mean a key move to the upside , &quot; a floor technician said . 
&quot; But it has to be followed by two more days up . 
on a technicial basis this was a big indicator , &quot; he said . 
soybean futures volume was estimated at 48,000 contracts , above the 41,153 traded Tuesday , according to the CBOT . 
soybean options volume was estimated at 12,000 contracts , above the 11,146 traded Tuesday .
