a Turkish court is to try 65 soldiers and policemen for the deaths of 10 Kurdish rebel prisoners during a jail riot last year , the state-run Anatolian news agency said on Wednesday . 
the agency said appeals judges had ordered a felony court in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir to try the 65 defendants for manslaughter and neglecting their duties . 
the local court had said the case was out of its jurisdiction . 
the accused could face more than 15 years in jail for the accidental killing charge and up to a year for neglect , the agency said . 
it did not say when the trial would begin . 
Turkey has often been reluctant to punish members of the security forces for heavy-handed tactics in the fight against Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) guerrillas despite criticism from Western human rights groups . 
the Turkish parliament &apos;s human rights commission said the PKK prisoners died when security forces , armed with shields and batons , used force to break up a protest about food supplies in Diyarbakir high security jail last September . 
an autopsy report gave the cause of the death of most of the prisoners as &quot; brain damage &quot; but did not explain how the injuries could have occured . 
the bodies had bruising and wounds , the report said . 
more than 21,000 people have been killed in the 12-year-old conflict between Turkish troops and the PKK , fighting for autonomy or independence in the southeast of Turkey . 
Rifaettin Kaplan , 25 , a prison officer at Diyarbakir jail , was found shot dead in his home in the city on Tuesday night , police said . 
they said they were investigating any rebel link to the incident .
