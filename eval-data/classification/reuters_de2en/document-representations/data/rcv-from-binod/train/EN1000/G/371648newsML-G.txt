Olympic gold medallist Brooke Bennett , competing in her first major meet since the 1996 Olympic Games , won her seventh national title Wednesday at the U.S. National swimming Championships . 
the 16-year-old schoolgirl won the 800-metre freestyle in 8 minutes , 38.41 seconds . 
it was the same event she won in Atlanta . 
&quot; I felt a little slow , a little sluggish in the water , &quot; said Bennett , who has been training five months . 
my expectations weren &apos;t high at all . 
in the same 800 freestyle event , Jessica Foschi , 16 , was fourth in 8 : 46.76 . 
Foschi is banned internationally for two years after testing positive for steroids in August 1995 at the national championships in Pasadena , California . 
she is allowed to compete in U.S. meets because the American Arbitration Association cleared her of wrongdoing . 
Foschi was fourth in the 1996 Olympic trials in 8 : 41.61 . 
in the men &apos;s 800-metre freestyle , Timothy Siciliano , 17 , won his first national title in 8 : 09.96 . 
it was the first of five days of competition at the national swimming championship meet , the first major meet since the Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta .
