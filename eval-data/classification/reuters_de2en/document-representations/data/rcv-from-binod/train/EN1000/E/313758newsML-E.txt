South Korea &apos;s central Bank of Korea said on Thursday it had set the M2 growth target for 1997 at between 14-19 percent , against a 17.8 percent rise in 1996 . 
&quot; This year &apos;s money supply will be managed in a way to ensure price stability and reduce the current account deficit , &quot; said Park Chang-in , deputy director at the bank &apos;s monetary policy division . 
he said the target was set on the assumption that the economy would grow about six percent and that consumer inflation would rise 4.5 percent . 
in 1996 , the central bank targeted the M2 to rise between 11.5-15.5 percent . 
but a shift in money from trust accounts in banks to savings accounts following maturity extension of trust accounts helped M2 growth to outstep the target , the bank said . 
&quot; Funds equivalent to four percent of the M2 flowed to savings from trust accounts since May . 
before taking this factor into account , the M2 was estimated to grow 13.5-14 percent in 1996 , &quot; Park said . 
m2 consists of money in circulation , checking account and savings account deposits with banks .
