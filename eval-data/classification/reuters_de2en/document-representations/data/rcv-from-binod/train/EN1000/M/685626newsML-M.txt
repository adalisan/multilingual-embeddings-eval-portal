most Bucharest shares ended stronger on Wednesday , but amid lower turnover from Tuesday . 
&quot; buying interest was moderately high , but there was a shortage of sell notes , &quot; a trader said . 
the Bucharest bourse &apos;s report of Wednesday &apos;s session showed the average prices of 16 stocks rose , 10 dropped and five were basically flat . 
twelve companies had no volume and two were suspended . 
three independent market indices , the VAB , the big and the CAS-SE , based on average prices and market capitalisation , slipped 0.1 , 0.27 and 0.15 percent , respectively . 
the drops were attributed to losses in high-capitalisation stocks . 
traders said they expected prices to continue falling through the end of the week . 
&quot; Investors view stocks , especially high-caps , as already too expensive , &quot; said one . 
share volume thinned to 2.9 million shares from 4.1 million on Tuesday and turnover in money terms slipped 3.6 billion lei to 12.8 billion . 
the first tier took 75 percent of the turnover , but weak supply depressed the closing quotes of four of the seven high-caps .
