European Union finance ministers began the first ECOFIN Council of the year on Monday , focusing on calls to bring Europe &apos;s diverse tax systems into line and aiming to avoid any controversy concerning the single currency . 
during a publicly broadcast roundtable discussion kicking off Monday &apos;s meeting , most finance minsters focused on the need to harmonise EU tax laws in order to prevent unfair competition among countries in the single market . 
&quot; This is a subject which has been neglected far too long , &quot; Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Ciampi said . 
with few substantial issues on the agenda , the ministers were expected to hold informal discussions on next month &apos;s Group of Seven meeting in Berlin . 
they were also to meet their counterparts from central and eastern Europe countries later in the day . 
EU sources said there was likely to be an informal discussion on France &apos;s proposal for a G7-like council to discuss economic policy under a common currency . 
although the proposal has come under fire from the Bundesbank , which fears it might be used to undermine the independence of the future European Central Bank ( ECB ) , few countries expect a major row at this stage . 
&quot; I do not understand the reaction from several people ( to the proposal ) , &quot; Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said as he arrived for the meeting . 
&quot; There is no reason at all for becoming nervous . 
Juncker is also Luxembourg &apos;s finance minsister and will chair EU finance ministers &apos; meetings during the Grand Duchy &apos;s EU presidency in the second six months of this year ,
