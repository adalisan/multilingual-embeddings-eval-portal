floor volume remained extremely weak at 13.2 million pesos compared to 14.1 million Friday , while over-the-counter deals dwindled to 49.2 million pesos from 74.9 million Friday . 
traders said activity on the Bolsa shrank ahead of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee talks Tuesday and Wednesday , although no change in interest rates was expected .
