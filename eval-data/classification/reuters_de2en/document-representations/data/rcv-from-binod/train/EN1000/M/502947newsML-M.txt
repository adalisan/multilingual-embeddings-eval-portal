Latin American oil producers are upping the ante in their quest to maintain and expand marketshare in the crowded U.S. Gulf Coast , traders said on Friday . 
Mexico &apos;s state-owned oil company Pemex and Venezuela &apos;s state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela , both major suppliers of short-haul sour crude , are offering Gulf Coast buyers &quot; pre-lifting &quot; terms , traders said . 
under this strategy , buyers are encouraged to lift crude in advance of their contracts , but pricing and payment terms are still based on the original lifting dates . 
&quot; ( Pre-lifting ) gives buyers the benefit of higher inventories without paying for them . 
you &apos;re holding inventories at no cost , &quot; a Gulf Coast trader said . 
even in a contango market , in which forward prices exceed prompt ones , the strategy can attract buyers who are interested in building up stocks . 
on the seller side , pre-lifting helps alleviate storage costs , traders said . 
Mexican Maya crude , which has an API gravity of 22.3 degrees and 3.4 percent sulfur , was priced around $ 5.35-40 a barrel under West Texas Intermediate / Cushing . 
Venezuelan Mesa , which has an API gravity of around 28.5 degrees and roughly one percent sulfur , was pegged at a discount of nearly $ 4.00 to WTI . 
both countries are increasing their sour crude production even as the market comes under pressure from other sour crude sources such as Iraq , Canada and California . 
at least one Gulf Coast refiner has agreed to the terms from one or both countries , while other refiners have discussed the possibility . 
elsewhere in Latin America , officials from Chile &apos;s state-owned oil company ENAP plan to visit Ecuador next week to negotiate a bilateral government agreement to buy crude , a Chilean diplomat told Reuters . 
Chile frequently buys Ecuadoran Oriente crude in its regular purchase tenders through brokers such as Ecuadoran Tripetrol and Swiss-based Glencore . 
separately , a new fluid catalytic cracker at Uruguay &apos;s 36,500 barrel per day ( bpd ) La Teja refinery is due on line at the end of April . 
the refinery &apos;s topping unit came back up at the end of last month , traders said .
