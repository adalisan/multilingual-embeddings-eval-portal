the San Diego Padres Tuesday rewarded manager Bruce Bochy for guiding the team to its first division title since 1984 last season with a two-year contract extension . 
terms were not disclosed , but the deal includes a club option for the 2000 season . 
the 41-year-old Bochy earned National League Manager of the Year honours after leading the Padres to a 91-71 record and the Western Division title . 
he was the first San Diego manager to win the award . 
&quot; I &apos;m honoured that the Padres have shown this kind of confidence in me and I &apos;m excited to be here for the next three years , &quot; said Bochy , whose team was swept by the St Louis Cardinals in the divisional playoffs . 
Bochy ranks sixth among San Diego managers with 161 wins and second with a .526 winning percentage . 
&quot; This is certainly a well-deserved extension and we are all excited to have Bruce as the manager of the club for years to come , &quot; said team president Larry Lucchino . 
&quot; A step such as this continues to add valuable stability to the organisation .
