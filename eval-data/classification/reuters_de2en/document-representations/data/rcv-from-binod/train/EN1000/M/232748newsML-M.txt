Singapore shares ended lower on Tuesday with most dealers expecting more falls before a rally . 
&quot; It has gone down a bit across the board , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; Institutional and fund demand was quite limited ... I think they are waiting for a little more of a correction before buying . 
market volume was 121.29 million shares , of which about a third was in new issued small capitalisation stocks . 
top of the volume was Wee Poh Holdings , which dropped 6.5 cents to Singapore $ 0.765 , trimming its spectacular gains on Monday when it was first listed . 
newcomers Nobel Design and Labroy Marine were also active . 
among the larger stocks , sound card maker Creative lost 45 cents to end at S $ 9.95 , retracing heavy gains made on Monday on the back of a recent successful court case over copyright . 
Chartists said the STII should track down to 2,125-2,150 points before recovering . 
but some local brokers are more positive , suggesting the index , which is based on 30 mainly blue chip stocks , is undervalued and may rebound soon towards 2,220 .
