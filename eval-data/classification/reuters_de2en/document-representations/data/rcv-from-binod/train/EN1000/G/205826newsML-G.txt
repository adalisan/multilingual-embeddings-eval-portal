all Black coach John Hart believes South Africa will be too strong for France when the two-test series gets underway in Bordeaux on November 30 . 
currently in England with the New Zealand Barbarians , Hart took over as All Black coach last December after New Zealand , under the guidance of Laurie mains , had tied a two-test series 1-1 in France . 
he took the side to victory in the TriNations series with Australia and South Africa and then became the first All Black coach to score a series win against the Springboks in South Africa . 
and having played five tests against the World Cup holders this year , Hart knows where he is putting his money . 
&quot; It &apos;s very hard to pick especially as I haven &apos;t seen any French rugby recently but I think South Africa are going to be very hard to beat , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I still think that France are potentially a really exciting side , perhaps the most exciting in world rugby , and they could really take these new rules apart because I think they suit them . 
but they may just be caught a bit short this time . 
&quot; South Africa have had a long year and I think they are improving . 
that is especially the case in the test side where they found some consistency in selection against Argentina . 
against us they were always changing , trying to find the right team . 
hart also said he had not been surprised by springbok coach Andre Markgraaff &apos;s controversial decision to ditch World Cup winning captain Francois Pienaar . 
&quot; There may have been more in it than rugby but after what I had heard and seen in South Africa it was certainly no surprise . 
&quot; And , besides , I think Gary Teichmann is a very fine captain for South Africa . 
he adds a new dimension and opens it up more whereas Pienaar is fairly one-dimensional as a player and as a captain . 
the South Africans begin their five-match tour of France in Brive on Saturday when they take on the French Barbarians .
