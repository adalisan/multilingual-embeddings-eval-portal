a former member of the Ku Klux Klan was scheduled Friday to become the first white man in Alabama to be executed for murdering a black since 1913 . 
Henry Francis Hays , 42 , was to die in the state electric chair shortly after midnight for the 1981 lynching of teenager Michael Donald , a murder which prosecutors say was intended to demonstrate Klan strength in the state . 
the case also brought about the first civil judgment in which a Klan organisation was held liable for its members &apos; actions and ordered to pay damages to a victim &apos;s family . 
Hays claimed he was innocent of the crime and blamed his 1983 conviction on his membership in the United Klans of America . 
but one of his fellow Klan members , James &quot; Tiger &quot; Knowles , testified at the murder trial that he and Hays cruised the poorer neighbourhoods of Mobile , Ala . , on March 20 , 1981 , looking for someone black to kill . 
the victim they set upon was Donald , 19 . 
the two men forced the teenager into their car at gunpoint . 
they beat him with tree branches and , after he tried to escape , put a noose around his neck and choked him . 
Knowles said Hays then slashed Donald &apos;s throat three times to make sure he was dead and strung his body up in a tree . 
the jury of 11 whites and one black that convicted Hays also recommended a sentence of life without parole . 
but the trial judge overrode that recommendation and changed the penalty to death . 
Knowles received a life sentence after pleading guilty to a federal charge of violating Donald &apos;s civil rights . 
Hays &apos; brother and sister this week made an unsuccessful appeal for clemency to Alabama Gov. 
fob James , blaming the crime on their late father . 
the father , Bennie Jack Hays , was leader of the United Klans in southern Alabama . 
he had been charged with inciting Donald &apos;s murder . 
but a mistrial was declared in his case after he collapsed during the murder proceedings . 
he died before he could be tried again . 
another family member , Hays &apos; brother-in-law Frank Cox , is serving a 99-year prison sentence for supplying the rope used in the slaying . 
&quot; I think the tragedy here was Bennie Hays , a man who orchestrated the whole thing . 
a very , very evil man ended up destroying his whole family , &quot; said Morris Dees , founder of the Southern Poverty Law Centre ( SPLC ) in Montgomery , which sued the United Klans over the Donald murder . 
in the civil case , an all-white jury found the United Klans responsible for the Donald murder . 
as a result , the teen &apos;s mother , Beulah Mae Donald , was awarded $ 7 million . 
the damages effectively broke one of the largest Klan organisations in the country and left the white supremacist group &apos;s Tuscaloosa , Ala . , headquarters building in the hands of the Donald family .
