the judge in the O.J. 
Simpson civil case completed the first phase of jury selection on Wednesday , having assembled a racially mixed pool of 102 people to undergo one last round of questioning . 
that final process is expected to begin early next week and produce the 12-person jury , plus eight alternates , who will sit on the case . 
Simpson , a former football star , Hollywood actor and television celebrity , was acquitted in October 1995 of the stabbing murders of his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend Ronald Goldman . 
the families of the victims have filed a wrongful-death civil suit alleging Simpson was liable for the deaths . 
if they prevail in the civil trial , Simpson could face paying millions of dollars in damages . 
Simpson , who attended only two days out of the jury selection process that began on Sept . 18 , was absent from court again on Wednesday . 
judge Hiroshi Fujisaki is expected to spend Thursday hearing motions , including one from the Los Angeles Police Department seeking to quash a request from Simpson &apos;s lawyers for the personnel records of former detectives Tom Lange and Philip Vannatter , who were at the scene of the June 12 , 1994 murders . 
the defence team also wants to see records of phone calls made by Nicole Brown &apos;s friend Faye Resnick while she was in a drug rehabilitation clinic . 
they believe Resnick spoke to Brown the day of the murders and Resnick &apos;s lawyers will try to persuade Fujisaki to quash the motion . 
on Friday , defence lawyers will ask the judge to allow them to present evidence they believe will show Simpson was the victim of a police conspiracy . 
during Wednesday &apos;s session , Fujisaki and the lawyers in the case added a final nine people to the pool of prospective jurors , including five blacks , three whites and one man who appeared to be of Middle Eastern descent . 
one man who was retained said his reaction to last year &apos;s not-guilty verdict in the criminal trial was to exclaim : &quot; Who says money can &apos;t buy happiness . 
the judge excused two people , including a postal worker who on several occasions delivered mail to both Simpson &apos;s home in Brentwood and to Nicole Brown Simpson &apos;s condominium , the scene of the murders . 
also excused was a Hispanic man who said he thought Simpson was probably guilty . 
Fujisaki told the attorneys to return on Thursday to argue several last-minute legal motions , a process which is expected to also consume at least part of Friday &apos;s court session . 
the final round of jury selection is scheduled to begin on Tuesday , after a long weekend to observe the Columbus Day holiday .
