Dutch shares finished a see-saw session lower as nerves about U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s testimony to Congress tomorrow gained the upper hand in late trade . 
the blue chip AEX index closed 10.45 points or about one percent lower at 931.34 , its third consecutive lower close . 
trading was described as reasonably busy for July . 
&quot; A lot depends on what Greenspan has to say about U.S. inflation . 
if it &apos;s negative , we &apos;ll probably come off quite sharply , &quot; said one dealer . 
technical analysts , taking part in a weekly Reuters poll , said the AEX remained in a long-term uptrend , even though its ascent might be interrupted in the short term . 
the shares had rallied strongly since mid-June but posted a steep loss on Thursday and fell further on Friday . 
in the same sector Akzo Nobel , whose shares have followed a similar path in recent sessions , was up 2.80 guilders at 282.50 . 
but losers outnumbered winners by over two to one . 
brewer Heineken , in decline since late June , shed 5.40 guilders at 315.20 .
