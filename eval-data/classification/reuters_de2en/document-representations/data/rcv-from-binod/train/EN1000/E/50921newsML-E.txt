reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) Governor Bernie Fraser said on Thursday that the Australian economy could probably grow faster given the spare capacity in the industrial sector and in the labour market . 
&quot; Can we go faster ? 
we probably can given the spare capacity in plants and in the labour market , &quot; Fraser told a parliamentary committee . 
&quot; It &apos;s a matter of being able to grow at a rate that will hopefully use up that spare capacity without running into constraints ( like ) inflation and the current account deficit , &quot; Fraser said . 
&quot; They &apos;re the two traditional constraints that have caused growth to slow down in the past , they &apos;re not constraints at the moment , &quot; he said .
