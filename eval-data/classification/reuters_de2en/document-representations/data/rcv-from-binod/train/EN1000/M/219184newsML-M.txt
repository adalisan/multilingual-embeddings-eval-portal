Australian shares ventured into record territory at the opening on Tuesday following another record breaking day on Wall Street . 
the All Ordinaries index was up 10.8 points at 2,405.5 in early trading after reaching a record high of 2406.3 . 
stronger base metals prices further sparked investor enthusiasm , with turnover levels setting sail for the A $ 300 million level in the first 30 minutes of trade . 
&quot; Everyone &apos;s in a buying mood so far , &quot; said a Sydney broker . 
&quot; The Dow keeps going up and turnover looks good . 
metals ( prices ) are also helping the miners , &quot; he said . 
Macquarie Bank topped turnover early as the Brunei Investment and Commercial Bank bought the 13.4 percent stake held by Hill Samuel , the investment bank unit of Lloyds tsb plc . 
expectations were for the early gains to hold and perhaps to even be extended in the afternoon . 
&quot; I think we will hold most of them , we may even go ahead again later , &quot; the broker said . 
rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about seven to six , while about 40 percent of stocks traded were steady .
