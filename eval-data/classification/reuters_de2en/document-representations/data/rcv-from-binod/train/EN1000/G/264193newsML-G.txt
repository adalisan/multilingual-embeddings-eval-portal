a fierce blizzard that stranded motorists and closed schools howled across the northern Midwest on Wednesday , while a storm spawned in the Gulf of Mexico dumped a rare snowfall on the deep South . 
temperatures below freezing accompanied by 60 mph ( 100 kph ) wind gusts made travel hazardous and drifting snow kept highways shut across much of the eastern half of the Dakotas and Minnesota . 
police in Marshall in southwest Minnesota set up roadblocks and urged residents to stay home after white-out conditions left roads littered with abandoned cars and jacknifed trucks . 
Sharon Fletcher in the Fargo mayor &apos;s office said the local shopping centre had closed , adding : &quot; It had to be pretty bad for the mall to shut down during the Christmas season . 
there were dozens of road accidents in North Dakota but no fatalities . 
motorists had to be rescued from snowdrifts beneath highway overpasses and at rest stops , Sgt. 
mark Bethke of the state Highway Patrol said . 
an icy storm in Oklahoma on Tuesday caused six traffic deaths in that state . 
&quot; The Dakotas , Minnesota , and Iowa will experience high winds for another day since this storm is slow to move east , &quot; the National weather Service &apos;s Todd Heitkamp in Sioux Falls , South Dakota , said . 
meanwhile , forecasters said a storm spinning northward out of the Gulf of Mexico will collide with the gradually moving cold air mass covering the nation &apos;s midsection and dump moderate to heavy snow from northern Alabama to New York state . 
the precipitation will likely fall as rain on Thursday on much of the East Coast , while sub-freezing temperatures extend South as far as the U.S.-Mexico border . 
North Dakota had already received half its normal winter allotment of 26 inches ( 66 cm ) of snow and winter has not yet officially begun , Heitkamp said . 
it was the snowiest autumn since 1982 and Heitkamp said the &quot; ground blizzard &quot; , which dropped only 7 inches ( 17 cm ) of snow , was caused in part by blowing and drifting of snow already on the ground . 
White-out conditions stranded motorists in cars and some people spent consecutive nights in crowded motels , trucks stops and in school gymnasiums . 
snow ploughs were starting to clear roads in the western Dakotas . 
on the heels of the blizzard , temperatures were expected to fall to minus 20 ( minus 29 Celsius ) in North Dakota . 
&quot; It &apos;s still blustery but we &apos;re kind of used to this bad weather , &quot; Fletcher in Fargo said .
