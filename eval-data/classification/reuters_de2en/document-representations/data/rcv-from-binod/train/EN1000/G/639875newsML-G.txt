Hong Kong has sent a powerful message to Beijing that acceptance of its imminent handover to China would be tempered with vivid memories of the bloody 1989 crackdown on the mainland pro-democracy movement . 
Governor Chris Patten praised the 55,000 people who poured into Victoria Park on Wednesday night for an annual vigil to commemorate the hundreds and possibly thousands who died when China &apos;s People &apos;s Liberation Army ( PLA ) crushed a student movement centred in Beijing &apos;s Tiananmen Square . 
&quot; I think it gave everyone an insight into the hearts of Hong Kong and I can &apos;t believe that these dignified occasions won &apos;t happen again in the future , &quot; Patten told reporters on Thursday . 
&quot; You can &apos;t stop people thinking as they do in Hong Kong -- you can &apos;t stop people having the same passions and feelings as they do in Hong Kong . 
intellectuals and politicians , Chinese dissidents , grandmothers and grandfathers , lawyers and businessmen , parents and children held thousands of flickering candles in memory of victims of the military crackdown on June 4 , 1989 . 
despite fears of future curbs on demonstrations and a call by post-handover leader Tung Chee-hwa to put down &quot; the June 4 baggage &quot; , organisers have pledged to continue the vigil . 
&quot; This meeting has been a very peaceful one and I don &apos;t see why we can &apos;t hold this gathering next year , &quot; said Yeung sum , a leader of Hong Kong &apos;s Democratic Party . 
political analyst Michael DeGolyer at Hong Kong &apos;s Baptist University said Wednesday &apos;s rally was a clear message to Tung and China that the protest movement would continue . 
&quot; Looking at last night &apos;s turnout and the quiet determination of the people there , it &apos;s rather clear that there is a very large segment of the Hong Kong community which has developed a sort of unity and an interest in politics and participation and in determining to protect their freedom and their rights , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The slogan of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong does have some substance now , &quot; DeGolyer said . 
Hong Kong newspapers gave mixed reviews to the rally , the last big pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong before China takes back the thriving territory of 6.4 million people at midnight on June 30 after 156 years of British colonial rule . 
apple Daily said the 1989 crackdown was not a historical burden . 
instead &quot; the lesson of blood &quot; was a driving force for Hong Kong and Chinese people . 
the South China Morning Post said the vigil did not mar the imminent handover and that the demonstrators &apos; peaceful behaviour should be &quot; a powerful incentive for a relaxed attitude &quot; on the part of China and the future Hong Kong government . 
the sing Tao Daily took Tung &apos;s view and urged Hong Kong people to put aside Tiananmen and look ahead to building a better future . 
a Taiwan official lent his support to the vigil on Thursday , inviting Hong Kong people to come to the island to mark the 1989 crackdown if large-scale commemorations were not allowed in the territory after the handover . 
China &apos;s moves to establish its presence in Hong Kong took another step on Thursday as Beijing announced that veteran diplomat Ma Yuzhen would oversee foreign affairs matters in the territory after the handover . 
Hong Kong will run continue to run its own domestic affairs after July 1 but will leave foreign affairs and defence to the central government in Beijing . 
&quot; The community will be glad that the appointment of Mr Ma Yuzhen has been announced , &quot; the Hong Kong government said in a short statement . 
China has also begun setting up its military presence in the territory with an advance party of about 200 PLA troops . 
but the commander of the British forces in Hong Kong , which are preparing to pull out just after midnight on June 30 , said the PLA &apos;s role did not pose a threat . 
&quot; Their military task is a limited one . 
there is no external threat to Hong Kong , &quot; Major-General Bryan Dutton told reporters at Hong Kong &apos;s Foreign correspondents &apos; Club . 
China &apos;s main reason for sending troops to Hong Kong was to demonstrate its control over the territory after what some in Beijing view as a humiliating colonial interlude , he said . 
the Hong Kong garrison was picked from among the PLA &apos;s best troops in the hopes of burnishing a reputation tarnished by the crackdown at Tiananmen Square , Dutton said . 
the PLA may make their first impression seconds after their arrival , the South China Morning Post said on Thursday . 
the paper said 50 primary and secondary schools had written to parents asking if their children could line roads and welcome the Chinese troops when they march across over the border from China at dawn on July 1 .
