Mexico &apos;s conservative opposition National Action Party ( PAN ) claimed victory on Monday in two state governors races , dealing another blow to the ruling party , officials and newspapers said . 
pan officials said they had taken governorships from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( pri ) in the northern industrial state of Nuevo Leon and the central state of Queretaro . 
Mexicans voted on Sunday for six governors of the country &apos;s 31 states , an entirely new lower house of Congress and a quarter of the Senate . 
also , for the first time in modern history , Mexico city residents elected a mayor . 
previously , the post was a presidential nomination . 
Fernando Canales Clariond , the PAN &apos;s candidate in Nuevo Leon , declared himself the winner of that state &apos;s race . 
pri officials said it was too early to call the result , though they acknowledged Canales was ahead . 
with 38.2 percent of the vote counted , the state electoral council said Canales had 50.4 percent of the vote against the pri candidate &apos;s 39.1 percent . 
in Queretaro , PAN candidiate Ignacio Loyola seemed headed for the governorship although the low preliminary vote count stopped the pri from conceding defeat , Reforma said . 
it said Loyola had 52 percent after 21 percent of polling stations had reported . 
President Ernesto Zedillo &apos;s pri was seen holding onto the governorships of the states of Colima , Sonora , San Luis Potosi and Campeche -- the last after easily fending off a challenge from the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution . 
if the two PAN victories are confirmed they would give the pro-business party a total of six state governorships throughout the country . 
the party already holds Jalisco , Baja California , Chihuahua and Guanajuato . 
the pri has held almost total power in Mexico for 68 years including the presidency , majority control of congress and most governorships . 
the pri looked likely to lose its majority control of congress , partial results showed Monday .
