Canadian Lt-General Maurice Baril said on Thursday he intended to establish his headquarters for the new humanitarian intervention force in Central Africa in Goma , Zaire . 
speaking at a news conference , the commander for the new international force said , &quot; The proposed location of my main headquarters will be in Goma . 
of course Goma is partly if not all destroyed and I will have rear elements of my headquarters that will be both in Kigali and Kinshasa . 
Baril said he intended to establish staging bases for the force , which eventually would number more than 10,000 troops , in Kigali , the capital of Rwanda , Entebbe in Uganda and Nairobi , the Kenyan capital with two &quot; secure forward operations bases &quot; in Goma and Bukavu in eastern Zaire . 
&quot; self-contained units will radiate outward from those forward operating bases to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid , &quot; he said , adding that the force would open a land corridor from Rwanda , Uganda or Kenya to get the humanitarian supplies and the soldiers to eastern Zaire . 
Gordon Smith , Canada &apos;s deputy foreign minister , stressed that the multinational troops would not use force to separate militias or &quot; intimidators &quot; from others in the refugee camps or to disarm any of the fighters lodged there because the level of violence would be high and refugees would be among the victims . 
but he said if anyone got in the way of the force &quot; they would be dealt with accordingly &quot; under &quot; robust rules of engagement . 
he also said that the force was expected to be in the region for a maximum of six months after which &quot; a follow on force &quot; would be needed . 
diplomats said this would probably be a U.N.-led force with some of the same troops going to the region now .
