European stock markets closed mixed on Thursday under the influence of a weak Dow and the dollar firmed further before the European close , consolidating its position well above the 1.83 mark and 118 yen levels . 
share trading was relatively thin and lacklustre with activity muted ahead of key U.S. employment figures due on Friday . 
London shares had been in positive territory for most of the day , though held back to some extent by a bounce in the already strong British pound , provoking further worries among exporters . 
however , by late afternoon the main FTSE 100 index slipped back under the influence of weak early trade on Wall Street and by the close London was about 0.4 percent or 20 points down . 
by the time London closed for business the Dow was 0.25 percent off . 
Frankfurt ended floor trading at a new record high before Wall Street slipped but in later electronic business the IBIS DAX index lost well over one percent to close 53 points down . 
the Paris bourse edged to a new closing high , though it was well off its peaks of earlier in the day . 
on the foreign exchange front the dollar ended firmer in Europe , shrugging off earlier weakness and finding some solace in U.S. data showing robust economic growth and signs of a tight labour market . 
the market &apos;s listless end-of-month mood limited gains though as dealers awaited Friday &apos;s U.S. jobs data for July for a clearer picture of labour market strength . 
economists expect the non-farm payrolls report to show 193,000 jobs were added to the U.S. economy in July . 
the dollar &apos;s rally above 118 yen came after fears of renewed trade tension with Japan had pushed it lower overnight . 
&quot; The dollar is still looking punchy , &quot; said David Bloom , currency strategist at HSBC James Capel in London . 
&quot; It is quite simply in a win-win situation , and downmoves are merely a correction rather than a change in trend . 
the U.S. currency has surged as much as 60 percent against the Japanese currency from a post-World War Two low in April 1995 but has fallen back nearly seven percent from the 57-month high of 127.46 yen it hit on May 1 . 
meanwhile sterling was looking robust in Europe , having rebounded above the three mark level and firming further late in the day . 
comments from chancellor ( finance minister ) Gordon Brown were taken as a signal he planned no intervention to depress the pound , ending five days of declines for the British currency and sparking talk of a quarter point rate rise next week . 
Britain &apos;s leading FTSE 100 share index ended lower for the first time this weak , unsettled not only by the decline on Wall Street but by the renewed talk of an imminent UK interest rate rise . 
with British Steel and other major overseas earners losing recent gains as sterling rallied , and Glaxo dragging drug stocks lower after in-line profits , the FTSE 100 ended 19.8 points lower at 4,907.5 . 
British Steel &apos;s chairman and chief executive , Sir Brian Moffat , warned that Britain could move &quot; rapidly from apparent boom to recession &quot; unless action was taken to reverse the pound &apos;s rising value . 
&quot; The government and the Bank of England should be encouraged to say they think the pound is ludicrously overvalued , &quot; he wrote in Thursday &apos;s Financial Times . 
in Frankfurt the main DAX index of floor trade hit another record closing high , though trade was described as quieter than in recent days . 
dealers said support came from Wall Street &apos;s overnight advance and the firmer dollar -- good for German exports . 
however , the IBIS DAX index of electronic trade closed down 1.19 percent , hit by the Dow &apos;s tumble in early New York trading Thursday . 
one focus was Daimler-Benz AG , whose shares slid sharply on profit-taking after the German industrial group reported a doubling of first half operating profits , generally in line with market expectations . 
the Paris bourse was among the best performers , closing about 0.2 percent up , but well off the day &apos;s highs . 
dealers said prices were supported by the settlement of July futures and options contracts . 
one big mover was car maker PSA Peugeot Citroen , which was ahead more than four percent to 716 francs after brokers upgraded the stock following a positive sales announcement on Wednesday . 
the dollar was at 1.8380 marks and 118.40 yen compared with 1.8383 and 118.40 in late trading on Wednesday . 
gold closed in London at $ 324.90 compared with Wednesday &apos;s London close of 326.65 .
