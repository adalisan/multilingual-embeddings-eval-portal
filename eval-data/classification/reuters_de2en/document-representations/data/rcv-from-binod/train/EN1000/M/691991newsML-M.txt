the Polish bourse &apos;s light downtrend should extend into next week during the public offering of copper giant KGHM Polska Miedz SA , this year &apos;s second long-awaited big privatisation , analysts said . 
on Monday , when the KGHM offering begins , Poland &apos;s largest commercial bank in terms of capital , Bank Handlowy , starts trade on the bourse &apos;s main floor . 
analysts said Handlowy could open above 40 zlotys after having sold at its IPO at 35 and rise to 45 before profit- taking set in , though it was more likely profits would go to the KGHM issue than the bourse , keeping the main index down . 
&quot; It seems there &apos;ll be a slight rebound on Monday but there doesn &apos;t have to be ... it seems that overall there could still be slight falls over the next two months , &quot; said Remigiusz Tarka , an analyst at IB Austria Securities . 
the main market &apos;s WIG index fell 5.6 percent this week to 15,147.7 points . 
on Friday the Polish treasury set the minimum institutional price of the issue of 55 million to 72 million KGHM shares at 19.5 zlotys , the retail price at a fixed 19 zlotys . 
KGHM on Friday said its May net profit rose to 51.5 million zlotys from 35.9 million last year , putting this year &apos;s net profit at 191.9 million zlotys versus 214.7 million over the first five months last year . 
analysts said Handlowy and KGHM almost made investors overlook a central banker &apos;s Tuesday statement that Poland faced a gaping current account deficit and a Czech-style financial crisis in 1998 if it failed to balance next year &apos;s budget . 
on Wednesday the finance minister said current fiscal and monetary policy should keep the deficit at safe levels . 
&quot; Foreign investors won &apos;t want to enter until the situation clears and it won &apos;t clear before the elections because no one will want to announce belt-tightening then , &quot; said Ryszard Wojnowski of Polish Investment Bank ( PBI ) brokerage . 
analysts said investors looking for more macroeconomic clues would be watching food prices for the second 10 days in June due on Monday . 
they said it was not clear if the 1.4-percent Friday rise by the National Investment Fund NFI index was a technical rebound or reflected optimism after Thursday &apos;s news the lower house cleared a bill offering the funds an income tax exemption for capital gains made on sales of firms in their portfolios .
