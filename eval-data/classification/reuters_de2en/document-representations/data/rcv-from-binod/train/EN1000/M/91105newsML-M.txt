Japanese users were modest buyers of aluminium when London Metal Exchange prices hit 27-month lows this week , but they mostly held to the sidelines to see how much further prices may fall , Japanese traders said on Wednesday . 
&quot; Everyone is bearish , &quot; said a source at a large trade house . 
&quot; They &apos;re getting nervous at these levels , &quot; added another trader . 
&quot; If it looks like ( the market ) is bottoming , they &apos;ll buy , but until that point comes , they &apos;re frozen . 
on Tuesday LME benchmark three-month aluminium fell to $ 1,357 a tonne , its lowest level in two years and three months and nearly $ 150 below month-ago levels . 
traders said users appeared to be looking at a target price of $ 1,350 a tonne or perhaps as low as the low $ 1,300s . 
the weakening of the yen to its lowest level against the dollar since January 1994 was also diluting the benefits of the price drop for Japanese consumers . 
&quot; If they were paying dollars , they would &apos;ve bought it up quickly , &quot; said one trader . 
consumers were mostly buying for near-term delivery , although some were also buying for the second half of 1997 in sizable chunks of 10,000 tonnes or more each , traders said . 
Japanese premiums to LME cash prices were steady to slightly firmer at about $ 60 a tonne . 
traders doubted there would be any sudden impact on premiums from the pending resumption of shipments to Japan by Venezuelan aluminium producer Venalum . 
the shipments will include approximately 50,000 tonnes withheld since the beginning of the year due to a dispute between the two sides over the veto powers of Japanese minority shareholders in the facility , a Japanese industry source said . 
although Japan &apos;s aluminium stocks were already considered abundant , traders expected Venalum to primarily just displace sources that had been filling in the gap while the shipments were being suspended . 
stocks in Yokohama warehouses have edged up to nearly 240,000 tonnes , traders said , while one added that the arrival of ingot from South Africa &apos;s Alusaf this year had also helped assure that the Asian market was well-supplied . 
in the copper market , traders noted a firming of premiums in line with rises elsewhere in Asia , and they expected supplies to remain relatively tight for the next few months as scrap continued to be withheld from the market . 
this was reflected in trade data for August , which showed a drop of more than 50 percent year-on-year in refined copper exports as the domestic market soaked up more of Japanese refiners &apos; output . 
copper traders had mixed reactions to Chilean state-owned copper giant Codelco &apos;s decision to leave next year &apos;s premiums for copper delivered to Japanese ports at $ 50 per tonne over LME cash settlement prices , unchanged from this year . 
while some said the move was not surprising , others said lower premiums had been expected and that some Japanese users may now look to other sources of copper .
