tennis star Steffi Graf &apos;s father will have to wait several days to see if a court will free him on bail during his current trial for tax-evasion , a court spokesman said on Monday . 
the court trying Peter Graf in the city of Mannheim ruled on Friday that he should be released on three million marks ( $ 1.98 million ) bail but prosecutors appealed to a higher court in Karlsruhe . 
&quot; There will certainly be no decision in the next two or three days , &quot; the spokesman said , adding that the court needed time to look over the case documents . 
Graf and family tax adviser Joachim Eckardt could face a jail sentence of up to 10 years if convicted of evading taxes of around 19 million marks on the multimillionaire player &apos;s earnings between 1989 and 1993 . 
the men who have been in investigative custody about a year went on trial 10 days ago . 
the court can free them if it decides there is no danger of their fleeing or trying to falsify evidence . 
Graf says politicians and fiscal authorities gave him the impression they approved of his financial methods in cutting taxes . 
his daughter , who is still under investigation , has paid the tax debt in full . 
Eckardt , for whom the Mannheim court set bail of 300,000 marks , must wait like Graf to see if the higher court will agree to release him from custody . 
Steffi Graf , the world number one tennis player , won the latest of her 21 Grand Slam titles at the U.S. Open in New York earlier this month as the trial was beginning .
