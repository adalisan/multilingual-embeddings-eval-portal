Israeli soldiers shot and lightly wounded a Palestinian youth during clashes on Saturday with Arab stone-throwers in the volatile West Bank town of Hebron , witnesses said . 
they said masked youths attacked troops stationed inside an Arab school where copies of the Moslem Koran were found torn up earlier this week . 
witnesses said protesters hurled stones and fire bombs . 
soldiers responded by firing rubber-coated metal bullets , lightly wounding one youth who was taken to hospital . 
in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Saturday about 1,000 Palestinians led by the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council Ahmed Korei demonstrated over the expansion of Jewish settlements . 
witnesses said protesters holding signs calling on the United States to &quot; stop supporting the Israeli occupation &quot; burned two Israeli flags . 
&quot; This is a message to the Israelis to let them know there can be no peace with settlements and that the Palestinian people have other choices , &quot; Korei told Reuters . 
Hebron has been a scene of almost daily unrest since right-wing Jews plastered storefronts with anti-Moslem posters depicting the Moslem Prophet Mohammad as a pig two weeks ago . 
religious feelings were further inflamed when Palestinians found that Yaacoubia school was ransacked and four copies of the Koran torn up . 
Palestinians charged Israeli soldiers desecrated the holy books but the Israeli army denied the charge . 
Israel handed over most of Hebron , home to more than 100,000 Palestinians , to the PLO in January under a self-rule deal but kept troops behind to guard some 400 Jewish settlers living in the heart of the old city .
