Spanish champions Real Madrid have offered Brazilian club Sao Paulo 2.9 billion pesetas ( $ 20 million ) for Brazilian international striker Denilson , the Spanish sports daily Marca said on Monday . 
a Real Madrid spokeswoman was unable to confirm the offer but said the club would be talking to Denilson &apos;s representative Luiz Viana later this week . 
Denilson , 19 , attracted the attention of European clubs with his outstanding performance in Brazil &apos;s recent COPA America triumph . 
he was reported on Saturday as saying he was keen to join Real but that Sao Paulo were reluctant to let him go before next year &apos;s World Cup where a good performance could significantly increase his transfer value . 
several Italian clubs are also reported to be interested in signing him .
