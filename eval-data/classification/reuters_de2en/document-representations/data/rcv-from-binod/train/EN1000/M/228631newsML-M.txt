U.S. spot natgas prices for December dove below monthly index levels Monday due to mild weather across most of the U.S. and a sharp downward trend in the futures market , industry sources said . 
December prices in the Gulf dropped more than 10 cents to the high- $ 3.60s to low- $ 3.70s per mmBtu as mild temperatures in the Northeast dampened heating demand . 
however , these prices still carried about $ 1 premium to November &apos;s indices . 
temperatures in the Northeast are forecast to turn cooler by Thursday of this week , which may entice more buyers to the market as the week progresses . 
in the Midcontinent , prices slumped into the mid- $ 3.50s , down about 20 cents from last week &apos;s levels . 
meanwhile , at the Chicago city-gate , traders reported closing deals at a discount to index levels around $ 4 . 
temperatures throughout most of the region are expected to remain near-normal this week , with milder temperatures forecast for the weekend . 
in west Texas , where temperatures hovered near-normal , Permian gas prices also softened into the mid- $ 3.50s , down more than five cents from last week . 
prices have eased in the Canadian markets , a trend which is allowing more export gas to move into the California market where storage supplies are depleted . 
as a result of the low storage supplies in the West , prices at the southern California border held steady around $ 3.80 . 
in the American Gas Association &apos;s latest storage report , stocks in the West region as of Nov 22 fell six billion cubic feet ( bcf ) to 326 bcf , or 68 percent of capacity , as compared to year-ago totals of 420 bcf .
