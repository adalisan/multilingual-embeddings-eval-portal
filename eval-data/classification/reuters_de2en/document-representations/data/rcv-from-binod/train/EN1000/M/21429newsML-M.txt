Caracas stocks closed off Thursday , dented by Wednesday &apos;s suspension of Banco de Venezuela &apos;s sale , but greater slippage was stemmed by investors who saw a buying opportunity , traders said . 
&quot; The Bolsa fell on the news of the sale &apos;s suspension , &quot; said Multinvest broker Jose Gregorio Tineo . 
but &quot; the fall was less than expected as buyers stepped in , especially for Electricidad &quot; he added . 
the market &apos;s 19-share index lost 1.56 percent to end at 4,664.42 as 16.6 million shares traded worth 4.7 billion bolivars ( $ 8.9 million ) . 
benchmark stock Electricidad de Caracas lost 7.00 bolivars to close at 400.00 , a lesser fall than many brokers expected . 
&quot; Despite what &apos;s happened with Banco de Venezuela its a positive sign that the government is still working to keep to the privatization schedule for other companies , &quot; said one broker who bought Electricidad . 
strong trade in the stock accounted for 75 percent of the session &apos;s total , some nine million shares . 
&quot; There &apos;s still strong interest in Electricidad , &quot; he said .
