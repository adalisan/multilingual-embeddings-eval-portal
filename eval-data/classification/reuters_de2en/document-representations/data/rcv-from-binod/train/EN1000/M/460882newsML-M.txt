Indonesian tyre-grade SIR20 offer prices were still stable in late trading on Friday with no fresh demand coming to the market , traders said . 
&quot; We don &apos;t see any fresh demand coming to the market after an overnight buying in Palembang . 
we expect the market to continue to be dull next week because we don &apos;t see any factors which can boost sentiment , &quot; said one trader . 
the benchmark SIR20 for April / May shipment was done at 50.00 U.S. cents / lb fob Palembang . 
traders said offer prices firmed at 51.00 fob Medan from 50.75 in the morning , but softened in Surabaya to 51.00 from 51.50 . 
in Palembang , offer prices firmed to 50.75 U.S. cents / lb against 50.25 in the morning and at 50.50 fob Pontianak and Jambi against the morning &apos;s levels of 50.25 . 
traders said the current wintering in areas such as Medan did not improve market sentiment there because buyers were scant . 
many traders in Medan have said they were not willing to sell at 50.50 because they thought it would not be profitable . 
traders have reported sporadic overnight buying this week but it has failed to improve market sentiment dampened by sustained poor consumer demand .
