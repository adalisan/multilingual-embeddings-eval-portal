AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi , in a pep talk before Sunday &apos;s Serie A clash against second-placed Sampdoria , told his players to believe in themselves and they would return to the top . 
&quot; I don &apos;t believe the crisis at Milan is very deep , &quot; Berlusconi was quoted as saying in Gazzetta dello Sport . 
&quot; Like everbody , I see our results and our game and it makes me worry . 
but this situation can be fixed in a short time -- we have the whole second half of the season to look forward to , &quot; added the former prime minister . 
&quot; Milan does not have to be rebuilt . 
these players can do anything they want -- it depends on their will . 
Milan , league champions last season , are languishing in 10th place in Serie A after a disastrous first half of the season in which they were eliminated from the Champions &apos; League and Italian Cup . 
Francesco Coco , a 19-year-old defender who is set to start against Sampdoria at San Siro stadium , said Berlusconi &apos;s talk had encouraged all the players . 
&quot; He is very charismatic and after the talk with him we all came out very enthusiastic . 
he let us know that we are still the best team out there , &quot; Coco told Gazzetta .
