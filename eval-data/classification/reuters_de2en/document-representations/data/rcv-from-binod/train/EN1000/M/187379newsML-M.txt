the jet fuel market firmed late afternoon on Wednesday on continued talks of renewed winter buying from North Asia , traders said . 
the December jet fuel / gas oil swaps spread ( regrade ) rose to trade this afternoon at 80 cents and 85 cents up from midday &apos;s quotes of 60 / 85 cents . 
December regrade was last quoted at $ 0.85 / $ 1.00 a barrel with Janaury at $ 1.00 / $ 1.20 , brokers said . 
&quot; The market firmed following a slight increase in activity in North Asia and the weather is getting cold , &quot; a trader at a Japanese trading house said . 
the balance November gas oil swaps were sold down late afternoon with deals done at $ 30,26 and $ 30.26 . 
earlier in the day it traded at $ 30.40 and $ 30.30 . 
traders said the market fell after the November gas oil futures contract on London &apos;s International Petroleum Exchange ( IPE ) expired on Tuesday and one trader was seen taking delivery of 865,00 tonnes . 
&quot; There are rumors that one 250,000-tonne cargo is headed this way from the IPE deliveries , &quot; one trader said . 
Japanese and South Korean jet fuel consumers have in recent weeks raised their spot purchases for December and January arrival cargoes but the premiums paid were largely unchanged at around the $ 1.50 a barrel to Singapore spot quotes , on a cost-and-freight basis . 
the gas oil market remained slightly bearish and was under some sell pressure following rumours of a large arbitrage cargo headed to Asia from Europe , traders said . 
balance November gas oil was last quoted at $ 30.20 / $ 30.35 and December was at $ 29.70 / $ 29.80 , largely unchanged from earlier today .
