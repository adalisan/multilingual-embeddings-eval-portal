the dollar finished a volatile session weaker against the mark , buffeted by jitters before runoff French parliamentary elections and a Bundesbank statement rejecting the German government &apos;s plans to revalue the bank &apos;s assets , currency experts said . 
earlier in the day , rumors circulated that a private poll showed the French Socialist party could win a clear majority in the final round of parliamentary elections on Sunday . 
the Socialists favor a less stringent interpretation of the criteria that countries must meet in order to qualify for European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU . 
by contrast , German officials have emphasized the need for strict adherence to the standards for inclusion in the single European currency . 
&quot; There &apos;s going to be a lot of infighting . 
chances are greater for an EMU delay and so the mark strengthens , &quot; said Chris Turner , a research director at I.D.E.A. 
Inc . 
the dollar ended at 1.6950 / 60 marks , down from 1.7005 / 10 marks at the open . 
the German unit had racked up gains against a variety of European currencies early in the session , surging briefly to its highest level in four-months versus the French franc . 
there was also talk that Spain and Sweden intervened to support their respective currencies against the mark . 
but despite the German unit &apos;s impressive showing earlier , the dollar managed to briefly surge as high as 1.7047 marks in the U.S. after the Buba statement hit the market during the afternoon . 
Buba crticized the plan by Bonn to revalue the bank &apos;s gold and currency reserves to help cover a shortfall in budget revenues that would aid Germany &apos;s efforts to qualify for the single European currency . 
the German central bank warned the plan ran the risk of undermining the stability of the single European currency . 
the Bonn government , however , said it would go ahead with its plans . 
the response to the central bank announcement was &quot; perverse &quot; , said Kevin Harris , an international economist at MCM CurrencyWatch . 
this should be positive for the mark because it implies a delay in the start of European Economic and Monetary Union , he said . 
&quot; However , that was so fully priced in that people took profits on the announcement , &quot; he added . 
for his part , I.D.E.A. 
&apos; s Turner said the whole credibility of the project is &quot; shot to pieces &quot; with the Bundesbank openly coming into conflict with the government on the news wires . 
&quot; So that &apos;s why , basically , the first thing to do ... this afternoon ( was ) to tend to sell marks ... , &quot; he added . 
dollar / mark also pulled dollar / yen higher as it initially rallied after the German central bank statement . 
yet dollar / mark gave back its gains to end lower on Wednesday . 
against the yen , the dollar closed at 115.83 / 88 , up slightly from 115.65 / 77 at the open . 
in other trading , the dollar finished at 1.4100 / 10 Swiss francs , down from 1.4180 / 90 francs at the open . 
sterling rose to $ 1.6402 / 12 from $ 1.6345 / 55 . 
the dollar ended little changed at Canadian $ 1.3823 / 28 versus C $ 1.3824 / 29 at the open . 
the Australian dollar closed at $ 0.7657 / 62 , up from $ 0.7634 / 39 .
