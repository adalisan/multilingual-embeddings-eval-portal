South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki on Tuesday ended a visit to Angola to help cement a peace accord by urging the government and its UNITA opponents to keep to a timetable for a unity government . 
&quot; It is important that we keep to the timetable . 
the president of Angola has invited other heads of state to come to the inauguration of a new government , &quot; Mbeki told a news conference . 
&quot; President ( Nelson ) Mandela has committed himself to coming here ... no matter what date . 
the unity government is due to be sworn in on Saturday but negotiators for both President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi said on Monday they doubted it would happen on time . 
Mbeki said his two-day visit was aimed at showing the ruling MPLA that South Africa was not meddling in U.N.-led mediation to solidify the shaky two-year peace since Angola &apos;s 20-year civil war . 
&quot; There was a misunderstanding that arose which was that South Africa was interfering in the role as a moderator . 
there was no such intention , &quot; he said . 
the inauguration of independent Angola &apos;s first peace-time government could be delayed because there is as yet no agreed role for Savimbi . 
he turned down an offer to become vice-president , and U.N. mediators are now proposing a position as a first presidential adviser with its own executive powers . 
Angola &apos;s Prime Minister Fernando franca van Dunem told reporters : &quot; There will be a government of national unity and UNITA deputies will take their seats in parliament , but I cannot give you a date when it will take place . 
Western diplomats said the possibility of the inauguration taking place on January 25 was highly unlikely . 
&quot; The inauguration won &apos;t happen this weekend and that is not all bad . 
neither side would be disappointed if it does not go through because this gives them more time to work out Savimbi &apos;s status , &quot; a diplomat said .
