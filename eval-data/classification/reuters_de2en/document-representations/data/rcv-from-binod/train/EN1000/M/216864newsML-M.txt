lower quality of coffee on sale forced coffee prices to ease by $ 5-8 on Tuesday at the weekly Kenya coffee auction , coffee auction officials said . 
traders said the number of good coffees were few , with main coffee buyers still short . 
news that the coffee auction would start operating as an exchange caught many traders by suprise -- they expected the exchange to begin operations sometime in January 1997 . 
the Coffee Board of Kenya said it sold all 24,651 60-kg bags of coffee it had on offer compared to 19,282 bags last week .
