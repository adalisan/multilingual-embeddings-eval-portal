countdown clocks began ticking ( on ) Friday for the shuttle Atlantis &apos; mission to collect Shannon lucid from the Russian space station Mir . 
Atlantis &apos; 10-day flight , delayed more than six weeks by rocket problems , a scheduling clash and a hurricane , is due to get under way Monday with a pre-dawn blast-off from the Kennedy Space Centre . 
&quot; It looks like the third time &apos;s the charm , &quot; said shuttle commander Bill Readdy as his crew of six arrived at the Florida launch site . 
&quot; Shannon is obviously looking forward to us getting up there . 
U.S. Air Force meteorologists predicted a 70 percent chance of good weather for Atlantis &apos; launch during a short seven-minute window that opens at 4 : 54 a.m. EDT ( 0854 GMT ) on Monday . 
lucid , the second U.S. astronaut to live on Mir , arrived at the 10-year-old Russian space outpost in March and was supposed to return home in early August . 
the 53-year-old mother of three told CNN on Thursday that her five-month stay in space had made her look younger and feel better . 
she explained that the weightless conditions had given her a natural face lift and she no longer has calluses on her feet . 
that even though we &apos;ve found the fountain of youth , I &apos;m still headed home whenever the shuttle gets here , &quot; she said . 
Atlantis will also drop off lucid &apos;s replacement , John Blaha , who is due to stay aboard Mir until January .
