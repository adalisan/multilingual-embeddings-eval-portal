Italy has reached an agreement with Albania to conduct naval patrols in the Adriatic to stem an exodus from the chaos-hit Balkan country , Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Monday . 
Prodi , speaking after talks with Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino , said Italy had also responded positively to an Albanian appeal for emergency food and medical aid to be sent to the country . 
Prodi said the accord with Fino would be signed &quot; within hours &quot; . 
&quot; There will be an agreement between Italy and Albania to patrol the Adriatic in order to halt the flow of refugees completely , &quot; Prodi told a news conference . 
he did not make clear whether Italian ships would patrol in Albanian waters . 
most of Albania &apos;s decrepit military fleet has been used in an uncontrolled exodus that has brought nearly 12,000 Albanians to southeast Italian ports since March 13 . 
Fino , who heads a national unity government installed in response to armed anarchy in impoverished Albania , said he wanted Albanians to remain in the country and work to rebuild its shattered institutions and infrastructure .
