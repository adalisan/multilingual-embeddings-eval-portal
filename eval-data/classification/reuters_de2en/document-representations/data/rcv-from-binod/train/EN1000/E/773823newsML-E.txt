China said Friday it had made major concessions in its decade-long bid to admission to the World Trade Organisation but the United States and other big powers said Beijing still needed to do more . 
trade diplomats said the latest round of discussions had yielded only minor progress , raising doubts that China would join the world trade body by next May , which Beijing had sought . 
a senior U.S. official said much more progress was needed for early Chinese entry , and Japanese and European Union envoys said attempts by China to open its markets had fallen short of what other countries expected . 
&quot; In the spirit of flexibility and pragmatism , the Chinese delegation has made some new efforts , &quot; Beijing &apos;s chief WTO negotiator Long Yongtu told negotiators from many of the trade body &apos;s 131 members . 
at a news conference , he said a pledge of faster openings to key foreign imports like automobiles and electronic products and a commitment to end export subsidies for farm products had been &quot; major contributions &quot; to the negotiations . 
given the sensitivity of the Chinese auto sector , the decision to remove import quotas for foreign cars and minivans over eight to 12 years rather than the 15 originally proposed showed Beijing &apos;s &quot; determination to eliminate market access barriers . 
the offer to drop support for agricultural exports , a key demand of farming countries in the WTO , had also been difficult but represented a &quot; major contribution &quot; to the world &apos;s trading system , Long said . 
but U.S. Assistant Deputy Trade Representative Robert Cassidy said that , although some progress had been made in bilateral discussions with the Chinese and the working group meetings , &quot; a lot more needs to be done . 
Washington , whose stance Chinese officials consider the main obstacle to entering the global trade body , was looking for a &quot; more comprehensive offer &quot; from Beijing . 
this would include a final version of China &apos;s market access proposals for reducing tariffs on outside goods and on phasing out non-tariff barriers like quotas , as well as a full offer on access for foreign service providers . 
long , who is also assistant minister for foreign trade , reported that Beijing was working hard on the services package -- originally due by now -- which would be submitted to the WTO by the end of August or early September . 
&quot; Until we see that offer , it &apos;s impossible to evaluate really where we are , &quot; said Cassidy . 
his assessment was shared by a Japanese official . 
&quot; A lot depends on the services offer , but we have been told not to expect too much , &quot; said the official . 
&quot; I have the impression we are just entering the real negotiations , &quot; he added . 
WTO officials said the next meeting of the working party would be held in October but no date has yet been set . 
diplomats say they expect Beijing to come up with some major advance at that session to prepare for Chinese President Jiang Zemin &apos;s visit to Washington for talks with President Clinton at the end of the month .
