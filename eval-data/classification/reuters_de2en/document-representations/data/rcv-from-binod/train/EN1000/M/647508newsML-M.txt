stocks extended their record-breaking rally for a second session in a row on Monday before ending with moderate gains as the outlook for low interest rates kept the bulls charging ahead . 
the Dow Jones industrial average ended 42.72 points higher at 7,478.50 , the second straight record finish for the blue chip index . 
including the day &apos;s gains , the Dow has surged more than 1,000 points since the start of 1997 . 
in the broader market , advancers outpaced decliners 1,414 to 1,087 on volume of 465.6 million on the New York Stock Exchange . 
though the session lacked the sheer firepower displayed Friday -- when the Dow jumped 130.49 points -- it brought the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s index of 500 stocks and the New York Stock Exchange , American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq composites to all-time highs . 
leading the rally among blue chips were technology and drug stocks , as investors focused on the potential export benefits of a weaker U.S. dollar . 
over the last five weeks , the dollar has fallen sharply against the Japanese yen and has recently begun struggling against the German mark , which has firmed on mounting uncertainty over issues related to European Monetary Union . 
&quot; For the most part , the groups going up today you could cover with the umbrella of exports , &quot; said Greg NIE , technical analyst at Everen Securities . 
&quot; Techs and drug companies are both beneficiaries of a declining dollar . 
among Dow stocks , International Business machines Corp. rose 1-1 / 4 to 86-7 / 8 and Hewlett-Packard Co. gained 1-1 / 8 to 53-3 / 8 . 
Johnson &amp; Johnson added 1-1 / 2 to 61-5 / 8 and Merck &amp; Co . Inc. rose 1-1 / 2 to 93-3 / 4 . 
shares in cable television companies rallied sharply , amid a flurry of high-profile industry deals . 
Comcast Corp. jumped 2-13 / 16 to 21-1 / 16 after Microsoft Corp. agreed to make a $ 1 billion investment in the company , a move that significantly broadens the software giant &apos;s reach in the broadcast business . 
Cablevision Systems Corp. soared 9-1 / 2 to 44-1 / 8 after it said it would buy 10 cable systems in the New York area from Tele-Communications Inc. for stock worth more than $ 500 million , after factoring in the day &apos;s gains . 
the developments sparked life into the cable sector , which had languished for an extended period , but the Microsoft deal in particular served as a wake-up call , analysts said . 
&quot; I think the deal forced everyone to step back and remember that cable is going to be a big player in the future of telecommunications , &quot; said Robert Froehlich , chief investment strategist at Kemper Funds . 
financial stocks ended lower . 
the group was an indirect casualty of the declining dollar , which contributed to a weak performance in the bond market . 
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 18 / 32 , or $ 5.63 on a $ 1,000 bond , pushing the yield up to 6.82 percent from 6.80 percent at Friday &apos;s close . 
bond prices and yields move in opposite directions . 
one bank that bucked the trend was BankAmerica Corp. financial , which rose 3 / 4 to 124 . 
the company announced two major deals , acquiring privately held San Francisco-based investment bank Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. for about $ 540 million and selling its Security Pacific Financial Services unit to Travelers Group Inc. for $ 1.6 billion . 
Travelers shares rose 3 / 8 to 58-1 / 4 . 
the BankAmerica-Robertson Stephens pact fuelled interest in brokerage shares , where consolidation expectations have been a continuing theme . 
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette jumped 4-5 / 8 to 56-3 / 8 and Legg Mason Inc. added 2-7 / 8 to 49-1 / 8 . 
the Nasdaq composite index rose 7.20 points to an all-time high of 1,412.04 . 
the American Stock Exchange index added 4.92 to 619.57 . 
the NYSE composite index of all listed common stocks rose 2.04 to 450.17 , a record . 
the average price per share rose 19 cents . 
the Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE , American and Nasdaq issues also known as the Wilshire 5000 -- was a record 8,180.238 , up 40.081 or 0.49 percent .
