Argentine bonds were mixed late Monday after a session of slow activity as players continued to see no clear trend for the short term . 
&quot; We are just in a traders market - it was quiet with little activity . 
I do not see big changes , &quot; said the head trader at a local bank . 
Argentina &apos;s FRB Brady bond due 2005 was down 1 / 8 at 89-5 / 8 , while the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 rose $ 0.23 to 125.55 . 
&quot; There were not many operations today . 
investors just covered some shorts and adjusted their positions , &quot; said an analyst . 
traders said the announcement of a planned $ 2.0 billion , five-year Bonte Treasury bond to be issued in the local market did not have a large impact . 
the first tranche , of $ 500 million , is due to be auctioned May 6 . 
&quot; I do not think it will have much of an impact , &quot; added the trader . 
in the money markets , call money rates rose to 5.90 percent from 5.85 percent .
