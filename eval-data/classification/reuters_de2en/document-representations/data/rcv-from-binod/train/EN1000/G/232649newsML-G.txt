Australian Foreign Minister Alexander downer said on Tuesday he was concerned about a possible security threat at Australia &apos;s embassy in Cambodia and would take up the matter with Cambodia &apos;s deputy prime minister . 
&quot; The American ambassador to Cambodia passed on to our ambassador in Phnom Penh on the night of the first of December a warning from the Second Prime Minister Hun Sen of possible action by unspecified hardliners against several embassies in Phnom Penh , including the Australian embassy , &quot; downer said . 
&quot; Our embassy hasn &apos;t directly received a threat but it &apos;s taking all appropriate security precautions , &quot; downer said . 
downer , speaking in parliament , said Australian residents of Cambodia had been alerted and that he would take up the matter in a meeting in Canberra later on Tuesday with visiting Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister SAR Kheng . 
Hun Sen told Reuters in a telephone interview he had summoned the U.S. ambassador to warn him of attempts at espionage in his and other embassies in the Cambodian capital and to say that security had been stepped up . 
he declined to elaborate on who might be behind the possible threat , which followed weeks of political tensions within Cambodia &apos;s coalition government .
