NATO leaders and Russian President Boris Yeltsin sign an historic pact in Paris this week intended to lay finally to rest the suspicions of the Cold War and allow the alliance to expand eastwards without creating new tensions . 
the &quot; Founding Act on Mutual Relations , Cooperation and Security between NATO and the Russian Federation &quot; sets up a NATO-Russia Council to bring Russia to the centre of a new emerging European security order . 
based at NATO &apos;s headquarters in Brussels , the Council gives Russia a voice , but &quot; not a veto &quot; in the rapidly changing European security landscape which will soon see former Warsaw Pact countries enrolled as members of the West &apos;s military alliance . 
Poland , Hungary , and the Czech Republic , three post-communist nations that formerly belonged to the Soviet-led Warsaw pact , are expected to be offered NATO membership at an alliance summit in Madrid in July . 
Romania and Slovenia also hope to be in the first wave of new entrants . 
Alliance enlargement has been strongly opposed by Moscow and critics in Russia say the Act , painstakingly negotiated by alliance Secretary-General Javier Solana and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov , fails to meet their concerns . 
diplomats say Yeltsin , aware he could not prevent at least a limited enlargement , has cut the best deal he could get and received strong assurances no foreign troops or nuclear weapons would be placed on the territory of the new members . 
Russia , which will be represented by a permanent ambassador at the Council , can raise virtually any issue it wants although -- crucially -- the deliberations of the Council , which will meet twice-yearly at foreign and defence minister level , will not be binding on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( NATO ) . 
President Bill Clinton , who arrives in Paris on Monday , has hailed the deal as &quot; an historic step closer to a peaceful , undivided , democratic Europe &quot; . 
Yeltsin says it means expansion will not threaten Russia &apos;s security . 
Russia is also set to gain a raft of other benefits , from inclusion in meetings of a new Group of Eight leading industrialised countries to cooperation on ballistic missile defence systems . 
Clinton , a strong advocate of enlargement , sees the process as righting the wrongs of the Yalta conference at the end of World War Two when most of eastern Europe was left to come under the &quot; zone of influence &quot; of Josef Stalin &apos;s Soviet Union . 
diplomats say the Paris signing ceremony , a U.S. gesture to French President Jacques Chirac who is under fire for bringing his own country closer to NATO &apos;s military wing , will be largely ceremonial . 
&quot; There will be a lot of back-slapping and smiles and very little else . 
it is a chance to show how well the new NATO works on a mixture of U.S. diplomacy and French food , &quot; said one NATO insider . 
but diplomats stress a large number of bilateral meetings have also been slated . 
&quot; All the work will be done in the bilaterals , &quot; said one diplomat . 
Chirac and Clinton are expected to seek a solution to the contentious issue of NATO &apos;s strategic southern command . 
Paris wants a European commander as part of its demands for a greater European identity within the alliance in return for rejoining the military structures it left in 1966 . 
the deal with Russia and enlargement are to be followed by the creation of an Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council for some 27 other partnership countries , many of which also want NATO membership but are unlikely to be admitted . 
those include the three Baltic states . 
last week , Russia warned it would have to review everything if NATO tried to grant membership to former outposts of the now-defunct Soviet Union .
