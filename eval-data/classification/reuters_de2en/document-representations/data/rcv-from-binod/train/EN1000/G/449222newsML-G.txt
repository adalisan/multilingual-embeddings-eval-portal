English giants Arsenal signed Austria under-21 goalkeeper Alexander Manninger from casino Graz on Tuesday for an undisclosed fee . 
Manninger will become the first Austrian to join an English premier league side when he leaves Graz at the end of this season . 
&quot; We signed him this afternoon and he &apos;ll be joining us in the summer , &quot; an Arsenal spokeswoman said . 
she declined to give details of the fee involved or the length of contract . 
Austrian news agency APA said the 19-year-old had agreed to a six-year deal and Graz manager Peter Svetits said : &quot; All I can say is that it is the largest sum ever paid for an Austrian player . 
&quot; We just have to agree on a few minor details of the contract , &quot; he said . 
Graz are reported to have wanted around $ 1.0 million for Manninger , who was under contract with them until 2001 . 
he signed for Arsenal after impressing manager Arsene Wenger in a two-day trial at Highbury this week . 
arsenal &apos;s first-choice goalkeeper David seaman is recovering from a knee operation and his deputy John Lukic is sidelined with a poisoned toe . 
both men could be nearing the end of their careers . 
seaman is 33 and Lukic is 35 . 
Manninger became Graz &apos;s number one goalkeeper last October after a brilliant performance in the San Siro stadium in his first European match -- a UEFA Cup tie against Italy &apos;s Internazionale .
