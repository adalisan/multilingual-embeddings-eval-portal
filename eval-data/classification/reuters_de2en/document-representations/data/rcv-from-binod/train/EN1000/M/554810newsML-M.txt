Australia &apos;s New South Wales Grains Board ( NSWGB ) boosted its share of China &apos;s imported barley market to about 40 percent in 1996 / 97 from about 10 percent in previous years , NSWGB managing director Graham Lawrence said . 
Lawrence was speaking after NSWGB chairman Athol Roberts told the NSW Farmers Association general council meeting on Thursday that Australia had captured a greatly increased share of China &apos;s barley export market this year . 
NSWGB had shipped slightly more than 500,000 tonnes of barley to China this year , compared with average-year sales of about 150,000 tonnes , Lawrence told Reuters . 
overall , to April 25 , NSWGB had shipped more than 600,000 tonnes of barley , with 500,000 tonnes of this malting barley . 
further sales had been made for shipment in coming months , Roberts told the NSW Farmers meeting . 
China , Japan and Saudi Arabia had been the major destinations for NSWGB barley with China the key malting barley buyer , he said . 
in feed barley , NSWGB expected to ship a total of 100,000 tonnes to Japan in addition to just under 100,000 tonnes shipped to Saudi Arabia , he said . 
Lawrence said exports had taken place at an average price of about A $ 225 a tonne , the level of the malt barley 1 pool price . 
the world barley market had softened since harvest with prices for malting barley falling by about US $ 15- $ 20 a tonne . 
feed barley was firmer than in December 1996 , although it came off a little in April , he said . 
the outlook for 1997 / 98 was still very positive with traders recently wanting to buy feed and malting barley forward , Roberts said . 
this would compare with more than A $ 250 a tonne returned to growers before storage , handling and freight on malt 1 barley in 1995 / 96 , an Australioan record , with final payments made in April this year . 
the EEC &apos;s waiving this month of all restitution ( subsidies ) on wheat , barley , malt and other rural commodities had produced the immediate effect of multi-national companies bidding as high as US $ 135 a tonne fob for new crop feed barley , Roberts said . 
on canola , the sales programme this year had been much slower than recent years , even though there had been more Australian exports , he said . 
following resistance by crushers in Canada , the U.S. and Australia to last year &apos;s high canola prices , a dramatic reduction had occurred in prices for seed , he said . 
NSWGB expected to make record shipments of canola for 1996 / 97 of 130,000-1540,000 tonnes , he said . 
with lack of early rain , Australia &apos;s canola plantings would be down on earlier expectations , he said . 
Canada traditionally plants its canola in May and weather problems may mean that the reported swing to canola away from barley and wheat may not eventuate , he said . 
&quot; There is therefore good grounds for forecasting smaller production and better prices later in the year , &quot; he said . 
sorghum prices had firmed over the last two months , led by lack of weather damaged wheat and barley and by increasing drought in southern Australia . 
this was up about A $ 20 a tonne on prices in January . 
prices had been influenced substantially by the NSWGB cash prices and indicative high pool returns , he said .
