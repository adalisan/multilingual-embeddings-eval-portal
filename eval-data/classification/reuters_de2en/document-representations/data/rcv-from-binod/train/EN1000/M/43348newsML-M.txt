Japanese shares in London traded marginally higher on Tuesday failing to significantly extend a sharp upward move in Tokyo , with little fresh news to give the market a boost , traders said . 
the Nikkei 50 index of leading Japanese shares trading in London ended 0.56 points up at 1,392.97 , after the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo gained 357.32 points or 1.77 percent to close at 20,559.59 . 
&quot; There &apos;s been a lot of talk but not a lot of action , &quot; said one trader in London . 
shares in Tokyo ended sharply higher as Wall Street &apos;s recent surge encouraged investors to buy Japanese shares . 
but trading in London failed to carry the rally forward . 
&quot; There &apos;s been some selling in construction and chemicals but that was just re-active to the Tokyo move , &quot; said one trader . 
dealers said blue chip shares attracted some attention , with buying partly on the back of currency movements . 
&quot; The currency seems to be approaching 110 yen , futures have held onto gains in Chicago and most people seem to think the market looks ok , &quot; said one trader . 
the banking sector also saw some buying interest . 
dealers said trading was now likely to be cautious ahead of Friday when September options and futures will expire .
