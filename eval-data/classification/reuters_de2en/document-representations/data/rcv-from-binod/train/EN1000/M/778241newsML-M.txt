the dollar jumped against the mark on Tuesday despite comments from German central bank chief economist Otmar Issing that the mark &apos;s exchange rate was one of the most important indicators in setting monetary policy . 
though his remarks initially sounded mark supportive , they were tempered by his other comment that there was not an automatic link between the dollar / mark rate and German interest rate policies . 
in equities , most European stock markets shrugged off a weaker Wall Street open to advance amid solid corporate earnings and expectations the strong dollar will help make European goods cheaper abroad and boost exports . 
by late afternoon in Europe , the Dow Jones Industrial average had cut its losses to trade down 4.88 points at 8193.58 , helped by strong technology stocks . 
but higher long-term interest rates , dictated by the U.S. bond market , were keeping a lid on gains . 
benchmark 30-year U.S. bond prices were down 7 / 32 to yield 6.50 percent before the first leg of the Treasury &apos;s three-part quarterly refunding . 
the Treasury will sell $ 16.0 billion in three-year notes on Tuesday , $ 12.0 billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday and $ 10.0 billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday . 
&quot; The stock market is still waiting for the bond market to find its footing , &quot; said Jim Benning , a BT brokerage trader in New Y ork . 
Issing said in an interview with &quot; Boerse-Online &quot; magazine : &quot; after money supply , the exchange rate is one of the most important indicators for the Bundesbank . 
the fact that the mark has weakened so fast and so significantly certainly gives us something to think about . 
he said it was not necessarily the mark &apos;s level but the speed of its depreciation that worried the Bundesbank . 
the mark has fallen 7.7 percent against the dollar since the beginning of July . 
&quot; These comments that are coming out are trying to make some effort to stop it ( the dollar &apos;s gains against the mark ) but short of intervening , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to work , &quot; said James Powers , vice-president at Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale in New York . 
the dollar &apos;s gains were broad-based . 
it hit a four-year high against the Swiss franc and hit the highest level since November 1989 against the French franc . 
the dollar buying spree started in the morning on relief that Germany &apos;s central bank had stuck to its planned , fixed 3.0-percent weekly money market operation . 
some traders had speculated the Bundesbank would surprise the market and also announce a variable-rate operation to allow rates to drift up and lift the mark from near eight-year lows versus the dollar . 
analysts said the market was now aiming to push the dollar up to 1.90 marks , especially if German jobs data on Wednesday shows little improvement in joblessness . 
the dollar &apos;s last visit above 1.90 marks was in October 1989 when it peaked at 1.9221 marks . 
a clearer path for the dollar to rise against the mark calmed Germany &apos;s stock market , which shed about two percent on Monday because of German interest rate jitters . 
Germany &apos;s DAX index closed bourse trading up 5.74 points at 4,302.68 , with banking shares among those with the highest turnover as merger speculation lingered . 
but Paris traders were not yet convinced German rate threats were gone . 
the blue-chip CAC-40 index ended down 8.31 points at 2,984.10 after Germany &apos;s IFO economic research institute said the Bundesbank might send a signal to currency markets if the dollar rose above 1.90 marks . 
&quot; I could imagine that a dollar above 1.90 marks would set alarm bells ringing in Frankfurt , &quot; said IFO economist Willi Leibfritz . 
London shares shook off interest rate worries before the Bank of England &apos; s two-day monetary policy-setting meeting , starting on Wednesday , to advance with strong corporate earnings . 
the FTSE jumped more than a percent to its second highest close ever at 4,960.60 , less than 38 points off its record high , led by oil and drug sectors . 
British Petroleum Co plc surged after it reported beeter-than-expected earnings and said it planned to buy back shares from &quot; time to time . 
&quot; The stock closed up 40-1 / 2 pence at 862-1 / 2 , just off its year high of 863 , set earlier in the day . 
BAA plc jumped after the airport management group said pre-tax profits for the three months ending June 30 rose in line with analysts &apos; forecasts . 
BAA shares ended up 17-1 / 2 pence at 578 , off its session high of 582 . 
but National Westminster Bank shares tumbled after earnings failed to meet analysts &apos; expectations . 
Natwest finished down 33 pence at 833 . 
in metals , palladium finished at $ 236 after being fixed in London at a 17-year high in the morning . 
the dollar was at 1.8790 marks and 119.03 yen , compared to 1.8635 and 118.40 in late trading on Monday . 
gold ended in London at $ 319.55 , down from London &apos;s close at $ 323.65 on Monday . 
( $ = 0.613 British Pounds )
