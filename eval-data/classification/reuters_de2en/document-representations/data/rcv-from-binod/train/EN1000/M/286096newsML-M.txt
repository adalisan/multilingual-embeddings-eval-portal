far Eastern granting of upside copper call options for March , April and May this year featured in an otherwise slow market throughout the festive Christmas and New Year period , option dealers said . 
the source of the granting was believed to be South Korea , traders said , adding that they saw it as a premium-raising excercise rather than a major directional play . 
&quot; We saw selling of copper calls at $ 2,300 and $ 2,350 ( a tonne ) which started last week . 
I hear it is probably a premium raising excercise by Korean sources , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; Apart from the call granting there has been no real options business done over the holiday period , &quot; another added . 
the January LME options declaration on Thursday was smooth , although lead provided a mild surprise . 
nearby copper volatilities eased on the recent granting . 
February 1997 was quoted at 24 / 25 percent volatility early on Friday from 27 percent a fortnight ago . 
this helped pull average 1997 volatilities down slightly . 
they were quoted at 23.5 percent on Friday from 24 percent two weeks ago . 
the latest run-up in copper values has failed to spark fresh options interest , but further gains could spur activity . 
&quot; Stocks are low , there are a few tight dates out there and the backwardation will get worse , so I am bullish for copper , &quot; one dealer said . 
nearby aluminium volatilities proved more stable during the Christmas period , with average 1997 volatility quoted at 17.25 percent on Friday , unchanged from two weeks ago . 
traders said business over the period was virtually dead , although light producer min-max interest for 1996 was seen . 
&quot; There has been a little bit of interest in 1998 min-maxing , which is helping to put a cap on forward 1998 prices at $ 1,600 to $ 1,610 , &quot; said one trader . 
Second-half 1997 upside nickel enquiries also emerged , with some players looking to take advantage of the steady fall in prices to lock in some protection . 
&quot; This certainly makes sense with prices and volatilities low as well as the contango not being that steep , &quot; a trader said . 
Febaruary 1997 volatilities were quoted at 24 / 24.50 percent from 25 percent two weeks ago . 
in late September last year nearby month volatilities were trading at around 30 percent . 
Thursday &apos;s January options declaration passed quietly except for excercising of $ 700 lead calls , which took a few players by surprise . 
the price impact was mildly bullish in the short term . 
for some dealers the outlook for the options market in 1997 was positive if the expected rally in base metals materialised . 
&quot; I can see call buying emerging for most metals later in the year , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; The outlook for most metals is bullish , particularly if the Dow ( Dow Jones industrial average ) fades over interest rate factors . 
&quot; We are already talking to a few people along those lines already , &quot; he added .
