NWE oil products were mostly softer on Tuesday as Brent futures slipped . 
gas oil was weaker losing up to $ 1 a tonne on the back of easier futures which modest gains in premiums could not offset . 
gasoline was slightly weaker in a quiet market with Eurograde barges done at $ 199 fob Ara in late trade , against $ 200 earlier . 
Naphtha was steady with perceptions of tight supply later this week following the continuing flow of material to the East . 
low sulphur barges were offered around $ 98 with buyers at $ 96 . 
high and low sulphur cargoes were quiet .
