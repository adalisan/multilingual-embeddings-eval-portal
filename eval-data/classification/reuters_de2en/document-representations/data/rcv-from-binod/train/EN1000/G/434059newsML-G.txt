two Indian soldiers were injured in Kashmir on Tuesday when separatist guerrillas fired grenades at a high-security army camp , an army spokesman said . 
the guerrillas launched four grenades at the army camp at Tatoo Ground in Srinagar , summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir state , the spokesman said . 
the grenades exploded inside the camp , injuring the soldiers and damaging three army vehicles , he said . 
the attack came during a general strike called by the All Parties Hurriyat Conference that is comprised of about 30 separatist groups . 
the Hurriyat called the strike to protest against the deaths of four separatist leaders in a shootout with Indian forces last week . 
the dead guerrillas belonged to the Hizb-ul Mujahideen , a hardline militant group among dozens fighting for independence or merger of Kashmir with neighbouring Pakistan , which disputes the region . 
India and Pakistan have fought two wars with each other since independence from Britain in 1947 . 
Pakistan denies India &apos;s charges that it arms guerrillas who launched a major offensive against New Delhi in 1990 . 
police used tear gas and batons on Tuesday to disperse demonstrators , protesting against the Hizb-ul Mujahideen militants &apos; deaths , in scattered areas of Srinagar . 
in another incident , suspected militants lobbed a grenade on a paramilitary petrol and opened fire near Srinagar &apos;s sprawling Dal Lake . 
two paramilitary soldiers were injured in the explosion , police said . 
police and hospital officials say more than 20,000 people have been killed in the seven-year-old rebellion in Jammu and Kashmir , mainly Hindu India &apos;s only Moslem majority state .
