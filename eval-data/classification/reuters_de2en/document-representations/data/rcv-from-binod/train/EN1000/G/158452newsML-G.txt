Cambodia &apos;s King Norodom Sihanouk turned 74 on Thursday after a year of personal setbacks , facing an uncertain future for himself , the monarchy and his war-weary country . 
&quot; It &apos;s been a difficult year . 
it &apos;s a year that &apos;s given him a lot of worries , &quot; said one Western analyst , noting political and health problems have plagued the king since his last birthday . 
Sihanouk &apos;s woes raised concerns about the future of the monarchy and the country since the king has been the only figure with the stature to bring together warring factions , leading to a peace that ended two decades of strife in Cambodia . 
for his birthday , officials in traditional emerald-green garb gathered to wish him well , and the king bustled about greeting his guests and laughing when monks ceremoniously doused him with cold water . 
despite his still larger-than-life presence , though , analysts said the king &apos;s role is on the wane . 
&quot; The king &apos;s role has become less important compared to a year and a half ago , &quot; said one Asian analyst . 
&quot; Because of his declining health and long stay away , the centre of power has been shifting away from the monarchist system ... The king has lost much of his influence , &quot; he added . 
Sihanouk has always stressed that the 1993 constitution which restored the monarchy provided for the king to reign rather than rule , but most analysts believe he has always harboured ambitions of playing more than a figurehead role . 
&quot; The king would like to exercise more authority , &quot; said a senior European diplomat , while adding : &quot; He may well have doubts whether the monarchy will survive after him . 
things got off to a bad start late last year when Sihanouk &apos;s half-brother Prince Norodom Sirivudh was arrested for an alleged plot to assassinate Second Prime Minister Hun Sen. 
the prince left for French exile in December after Sihanouk &apos;s intervention . 
the king next found himself embroiled in a power-sharing row between the main coalition parties , his son Prince Norodom Ranariddh &apos;s FUNCINPEC and Hun Sen &apos;s Cambodian People &apos;s Party . 
but the eclipse of royal influence was most clearly shown in the run-up to his birthday , which Sihanouk said he planned to mark by releasing all but the most dangerous criminals . 
in the face of criticism from quarters loyal to Hun Sen , he retracted the amnesty , which was ironically prompted by his most important gesture of the year -- pardoning dissident guerrilla leader Ieng Sary from a death sentence handed down for his role in the genocide of the 1975-79 Khmer Rouge rule . 
the amnesty of the former Khmer Rouge foreign minister allowed peace talks to continue . 
&quot; The ( prisoner ) amnesty had nothing to do with human rights or the conditions of the prisons . 
it was about Sirivudh , and it was cloaked in the mass amnesty , &quot; asserted an Asian analyst . 
he said the king &apos;s failure to successfully exercise his sole power under the constitution showed just how weak he was . 
there was good and bad news on the health front . 
Sihanouk &apos;s doctors said he had beaten cancer , but arterial and coronary problems dogged the king and in May he suffered a mini-stroke that left him temporarily paralysed on one side of his body . 
the health problems of the king leave many wondering who could succeed Sihanouk . 
&quot; The king has served as a binding force . 
because of the personality and character of Sihanouk , succession is a hard issue , &quot; said the Asian analyst .
