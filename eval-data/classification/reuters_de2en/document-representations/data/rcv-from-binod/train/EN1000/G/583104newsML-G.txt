Romanian princess Alexandra Caradja-Kretzulesco , who claimed direct descent from the mediaeval hero whose exploits gave rise to the fictional vampire Count Dracula , has died in Paris aged 77 , friends said on Wednesday . 
Caradja-Kretzulesco fled to France in 1947 when the Communists took power in Bucharest and was active in charities which helped Romania when they were overthrown in 1989 . 
specialists said she was especially proud her family tree indicated she descended from the 15th century Prince Vlad of Transylvania , also known as Vlad the Impaler or the Dragon ( Dracula in Romanian ) who drove Turkish armies from the country . 
Irish author Bram Stoker based his 19th century vampire novel &quot; Dracula &quot; around the Romanian national hero .
