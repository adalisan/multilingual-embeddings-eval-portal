more technical selling appeared when Oct futures broke 1,150 rgt . 
next immediate support is 1,135 and resistance is 1,160 . 
poor fundamentals also undermined the market . 
the recent gains were due to the ringgit &apos;s weakness against the U.S. dollar , which prompted shortcovering and speculative buying , pushing the October to a high 1,187 ringgit . 
however there were some profit-taking as the ringgit rebounded today . 
October futures closed 15 ringgit lower at 1,146 ringgit ( $ 437.07 ) after trading between 1,142 and 1,160 . 
&quot; Again the market is talking about the poor fundamentals which are hitting sentiment , &quot; a trader said , adding that talk was mainly on stock which could rise to one million tonnes .
