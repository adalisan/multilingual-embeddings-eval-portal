South Africa is fighting to attract foreign investment to drive growth into the next century but has to lift productivity from among the world &apos;s lowest levels . 
the country ranked 44th out of 46 countries according to the latest survey by the International Institute for Management Development . 
in a separate report , the World Economic Forum puts South Africa 43rd out of 49 countries in terms of competitiveness . 
this is not good for a country which is now part of the world economy and is relying on foreign cash to achieve the goals set out in its recently unveiled macro-economic strategy , &quot; Growth , Employment and redistribution . 
the package is designed to double annual growth to 6.1 percent and create 409,000 new jobs a year by 2000 . 
&quot; The problem , &quot; says Jan Visser of the International productivity Institute ( NPI ) , which will hold an international meeting here next week , &quot; is the climate in individual organisations and the adversarial relationship that has existed between labour and management . 
the South African investment environment has so far proved unattractive to foreigners . 
the government plans tax incentives to stimulate new investment in competitive and labour-absorbing projects . 
noting the danger of a wage-price spiral , it has also stressed the need for wage moderation and said pay rises should not exceed average productivity growth . 
productivity improvements are firmly on the agenda in the country &apos;s economic development . 
&quot; An important constraint preventing firms from being more productive is the lack of co-operation between management and workers , &quot; says Visser . 
South African Chamber of Business ( Sacob ) industrial affairs committee chairman Hugo Snickers agrees : &quot; The adversarial relationship that exists at the moment is obviously not conducive to productivity . 
linked to improving workplace interaction is the focus on the quality of management and leadership . 
&quot; The country has excellent top managers but we lack good middle and junior management , people who can be the drivers of productivity , &quot; according to Visser . 
Sacob &apos;s Snickers says training must also be improved . 
South African business spends around 1.5 percent of payroll on training and development whereas Europe and Japan spend between six and 10 percent . 
Visser says Japan is an example where management and workers negotiated a social contract which guaranteed workers their jobs if productivity was raised . 
&quot; When the Japanese increased productivity , they could not reduce labour . 
they had to sell more products and go to international markets , forcing them to become more export-orientated . 
this , he says , is what South Africa needs to break the balance of payments constraint . 
the picture is not all bleak . 
reserve Bank figures show labour productivity has improved this decade , rising in non-farm sectors from 0.3 percent in 1990 to 1.2 percent in 1992 and 3.2 percent in 1995 . 
according to the NPI , multifactor productivity -- a weighted combination of labour and capital productivity -- rose 2.5 percent last year . 
there have been some notable advances , but South Africa has a long way to go . 
Anglo American Industrial Corp Ltd associate Samcor , for example , has raised production per employee from 10 to 15 cars a year since 1994 . 
but at an improvement rate of five vehicles a year , it will take 10 years to reach the 1994 productivity level of 65 cars per employee achieved at Ford &apos;s plant in Valencia , Spain .
