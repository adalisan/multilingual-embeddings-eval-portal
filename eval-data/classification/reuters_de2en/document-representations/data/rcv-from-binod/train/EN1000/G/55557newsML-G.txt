a presumed member of the rebel Popular Revolutionary Army ( EPR ) was killed early on Monday in an apparent skirmish with the army in the southern state of Guerrero , a justice official and media reports said . 
if confirmed , the fighting would be the first involving fatalities among the EPR since it launched a series of coordinated strikes on army and police posts in Guerrero and other states in late August . 
&quot; By his appearence , he was from the EPR , &quot; Ramon Almonte , a prosecutor in the tourist resort of Acapulco who was heading an investigation into the killing , told Reuters . 
Almonte said the dead man , whom he identified as Benjamin Avila Blanco , 21 , was found wearing the olive green and coffee-coloured uniform of the EPR . 
his face was masked and he wore a cap similar to those seen in EPR videos , he added . 
he was found by the side of the road near Aguas Blancas , some 20 miles ( 32 kms ) northwest of Acapulco , at the site where the EPR first announced its existence at a left-wing political rally on June 28 . 
national television network TV Azteca reported that five masked gunmen clashed with a 150-strong army unit early on Saturday near Aguas Blancas , and that one rebel died and one was injured . 
it said the dead man was abandoned with an AK-47 assault rifle and three rucksacks containing explosives . 
national broadcaster Radio Red quoted a local mayor as saying about 60 EPR members held a vigil overnight at the site in Aguas Blancas where 17 peasants were gunned down by police in June 1995 . 
Almonte said he was unable to confirm there was a clash and spokesmen for the Mexican army were not immediately available for comment . 
other government offices were closed for the Independence Day holiday . 
the EPR &apos;s main assaults to date have been against police and soldiers . 
some 15 people were killed and 22 wounded in a coordinated series of strikes on Aug . 28-29 in several Mexican states , according to official figures . 
Mexico has been on a state of alert for rebel attacks during Independence Day celebrations on Sunday and Monday , but most of the country was calm , officials said .
