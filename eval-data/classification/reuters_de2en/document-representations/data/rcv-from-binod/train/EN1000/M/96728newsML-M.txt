a new settlement system for Ecu-denominated Italian Treasury notes ( CTE ) will start on Monday on the over-the-counter secondary market , the Bank of Italy said in a statement . 
the central bank said the system would operate according to the delivery versus payment ( DVP ) procedure . 
the new system , called Sirte , due to the introduction of technical innovations , was designed to remove some of the obstacles which still limit trade in CTEs , the Bank said . 
also , the new system would allow banks to gain experience in the management of a gross settlement system with DVP , in line with the international trend towards adopting more secure settlement procedures . 
the Bank of Italy , as operator of the Sirte system , and in agreement with the Italian Banking Association , said it had in the initial phase limited access to the system to a fixed number of banks , among which are the six Italian Ecu clearer banks and some Italian branches of the major foreign banks . 
but participation in the system could gradually be expanded to other interested banks which satisfy the criteria for access , the Bank added .
