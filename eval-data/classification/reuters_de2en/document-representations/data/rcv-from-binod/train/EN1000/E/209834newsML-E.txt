APEC ministers on Friday approved a collective action plan on trade and investment and agreed to refine the criteria for admitting new members to the Pacific Rim group , a senior Philippine official said . 
foreign Ministry Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino told a news briefing the foreign and trade ministers , on the first day of their annual APEC gathering , had also discussed the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) meeting in Singapore next month . 
they had &quot; still to come to grips &quot; with the more contentious Information Technology Agreement ( ITA ) which the United States wants to eradicate tariffs on global trade in computer and telecommunications equipment by the turn of the century . 
Severino expected a consensus statement on the issue . 
the Manila Action Plan for APEC 1996 ( MAPA ) approved by the ministers provides a road map towards the target of free trade and investment in Pacific Rim economies by the year 2020 -- 2010 for the industrialised states , and 10 years later for the developing nations . 
Severino said that during the Friday session , Australia , the Philippines and South Korea announced the adoption of an &quot; APEC business travel card &quot; , with the hope that others among the 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum would join in . 
he said the card &quot; would permit business people who are really business people to travel more freely and more conveniently among the three countries &quot; . 
on enlarging APEC after a three-year moratorium on new members expires next Monday , Severino said the ministers would continue to work on the criteria for membership , with a view to adopting the criteria at the APEC meeting and summit in Vancouver , Canada , next year . 
&quot; In accordance with these criteria , new members will be announced in Kuala Lumpur in 1998 and will be admitted and participate in New Zealand in 1999 , &quot; he said . 
Severino said some members , including the United States , were against a rapid expansion of the group . 
he said 11 nations -- which include Vietnam , India , Pakistan , Russia , Colombia , Peru , Ecuador and Mongolia -- had expressed interest in joining APEC , but no specific countries had been mentioned during the ministerial discussion . 
APEC currently comprises Australia , Brunei , Canada , Chile , China , Hong Kong , Indonesia , Japan , Malaysia , Mexico , New Zealand , Papua New Guinea , the Philippines , Singapore , South Korea , Taiwan , Thailand and the United States . 
the ministerial talks will be followed on Monday by the annual APEC summit in Subic Bay , north of Manila .
