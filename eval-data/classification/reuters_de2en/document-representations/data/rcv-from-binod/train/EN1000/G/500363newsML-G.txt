India &apos;s political crisis deepened on Thursday as the rebellious Congress party ordered lawmakers to vote to topple their former ally , Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda , and the ruling coalition predicted snap polls . 
Congress issued a notice to deputies to vote against a confidence motion which DEVE Gowda was set to put before the lower house of parliament on Friday . 
the order raised pressure on DEVE Gowda &apos;s centre-left ruling coalition to bow to its rival &apos;s demand that the prime minister relinquish power before the vote . 
but the United Front alliance stood firm . 
&quot; Our stand is final . 
there is no question of a change of leadership , &quot; United Front leader Harkishen Singh Surjeet told a news conference . 
while both sides held open the possibility of last-minute talks before the confidence motion on Friday , the United Front indicated it was prepared to face the electorate for the second time in a year if DEVE Gowda lost the vote . 
&quot; It is reasonable to expect elections in May or June , &quot; a senior United Front official , who asked not to be identified , told reporters . 
&quot; We are not only confident , but it is eminently reasonable that the caretaker government will be headed by DEVE Gowda . 
earlier on Friday , talks between the two groups ended in deadlock , with the United Front alliance refusing to abandon its support for DEVE Gowda , who took power as the head of the minority government last June after inconclusive elections . 
the United Front said it was still willing to talk to Congress . 
but Congress leader Ved Prakash told Reuters : &quot; Our doors are open only if DEVE Gowda resigns . 
Congress stood firm by its demand that DEVE Gowda step down , and said it was prepared for talks even after the confidence vote on Friday . 
DEVE Gowda has been accused by Congress party president Sitaram Kesri of trying to sideline India &apos;s oldest party . 
&quot; Even after the government falls , we can still talk , &quot; Congress spokesman Vithal Gadgil said . 
politicians said Congress appeared to want DEVE Gowda to step down before the confidence vote while the United Front and Congress sought to find a new leader from either of the camps , averting snap polls that analysts said would strengthen the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) . 
the BJP has said it opposes both the United Front and Congress , but has not yet indicated how it would vote on the confidence motion . 
the Hindu nationalist party held power for 12 days last May but stepped down when it failed to muster a majority , and it believes fresh polls could strengthen its hand . 
if the BJP , the largest party in parliament , were to abstain from the confidence vote the coalition could still survive . 
it controls 193 votes in the 545-seat lower house of parliament , the Lok Sabha , while Congress has 140 and the United Front coalition 180 . 
if both Congress and the BJP voted against DEVE Gowda on Friday , his government would be sure to fall as it lacks an outright majority in the hung parliament . 
that would force President Shankar Dayal Sharma to turn to another politician -- probably from either Congress or the BJP -- to try to form a fresh government , or the president could call general elections . 
the lower house was set to convene at 11 a.m. ( 0530 GMT ) on Friday to take up the confidence motion . 
the Press Trust of India said 20 to 30 Congress deputies had asked their party to withdraw the notice to vote against DEVE Gowda , apparently marking a split in the party .
