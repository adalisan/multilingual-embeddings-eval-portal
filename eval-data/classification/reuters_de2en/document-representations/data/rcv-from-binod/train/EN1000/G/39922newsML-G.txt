an unusually frank discussion by Pope John Paul &apos;s chief spokesman about his health may signal a cautious start to an era of openness at the Vatican about what ails the leader of the world &apos;s 960 million Roman Catholics . 
the Pontiff , currently in the 18th year of a history-making papacy , clearly is not a man who is at death &apos;s door . 
on Sunday he spoke for 20 minutes while standing at his summer residence and plans a Vatican audience on Wednesday . 
but more often than not , the 76-year-old Pope appears fatigued and sometimes clearly in discomfort during appearances . 
his left hand shakes , at times uncontrollably , and he frequently seems to have lost much of the vigour that made him famous . 
on Sunday , even a cheering crowd failed to draw a smile from him . 
what exactly is wrong with the Pope ? 
the Vatican has always been tight on details of his health . 
the Pope &apos;s personal doctor , Renato Buzzonetti , has never held a news conference , even after the Pontiff underwent surgery in 1981 , 1992 and 1994 . 
but on Saturday in Hungary , after a fatigued Pope sparked fresh concern among journalists , chief spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls became uncharacteristically forthcoming . 
&quot; I have no interest in demonstrating that the Pope is a superman , &quot; said Navarro-Valls , adding that the Pope &quot; basically ... remains a healthy man &quot; . 
but the conversation by the man sometimes called the &quot; Papal spin doctor &quot; indicated that the Vatican may have decided on a new tack now that it has become painfully obvious that the Pope is no longer the vigorous man who once left aides breathless . 
Navarro-Valls , himself a trained doctor , said the Pope had suffered from an intestinal infection that caused a fever twice this year and which tests had so far failed failed to pinpoint . 
he said the while the problem might recur , it was not degenerative and that there were no signs of a return of a tumour removed in 1992 . 
&quot; We still don &apos;t know the origin of this infection . 
is it the same or a different one ? 
probably it is the same one because it has already surfaced several times , &quot; Navarro-Valls said in a briefing on Saturday before the Pope returned to Rome . 
he added that antibiotics the Pope has taken for the infection &quot; tend to make him feel dejected &quot; . 
aides say old age and loss of some mobility following leg surgery in 1994 have taken their psychological toll on a man accustomed to being so active . 
Navarro-Valls said one explanation for the infection was that it may be caused by adhesions in the intestine . 
adhesion , or the joining of normally separate tissues , occurs between loops of intestine in people who have undergone abdominal surgery . 
the Pope had major abdominal surgery in 1981 after an assassination attempt and in 1992 to remove a colon tumour . 
in both cases surgeons removed tracts of his intestine . 
intestinal adhesions can cause obstructions of the alimentary canal and sometimes sharp pain during digestion , which could shed light on some of his unexplained grimaces . 
Navarro-Valls said there was a possibility that the Pope could eventually undergo a laparoscopy , an examination of the abdominal structure in which an illuminated viewing tube is inserted through a small incision . 
the Vatican has never fully explained the sometimes violent trembling in the Pope &apos;s left hand and a sometimes drooping right eyelid . 
in the past , the Vatican has said this was probably caused by nerve damage suffered in the 1981 shooting . 
now , some Vatican officials say privately this may be caused by some other neurological disorder . 
doctors who have observed the Pope from a distance say the symtoms are similar to those at the initial stages of Parkinson &apos;s disease . 
Navarro-Valls said the Pope had no plans to stop the foreign travel that has been the hallmark of his papacy . 
a visit to France later this month is still on and four trips are planned for next year .
