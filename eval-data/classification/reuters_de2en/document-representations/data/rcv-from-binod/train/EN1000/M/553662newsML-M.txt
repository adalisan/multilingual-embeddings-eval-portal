North American bunker prices were steady to a tad higher in quiet trade late this week due largely to the May Day holiday in Europe , players said Thursday . 
the holiday closed most of the European hubs and players said they did not expect enquiries to pick up until Friday . 
&quot; We saw a little pop in Houston on Wednesday as people tried to buy bunkers before the holiday but the price will probably drift back down on Friday , &quot; said an East Coast player .
