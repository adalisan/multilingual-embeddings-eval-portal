life at Aung San Suu Kyi &apos;s lakeside residence has changed drastically in the past 18 months . 
in appearances alone , 54 University Avenue scarcely looks like the place which served as the Nobel Peace laureate &apos;s prison for six years . 
when Suu Kyi was released from house arrest in July 1995 , journalists saw a run-down house in dire need of a new paint job surrounded by waist-high vegetation that had been allowed to grow wild during the years Suu Kyi was forced to remain at home . 
after her release , Suu Kyi joked she was worried the media would be attacked by snakes living in the overgrown weeds . 
now the once-sleepy home on the shores of Inya Lake has a sharply different atmosphere . 
the grass is trimmed and a small garden is planted at the back of the main house , which still has peeling paint and mould spots . 
a huge , thatched-roof meeting hall that can house up to 1,000 people has been erected right in the middle of the compound , where Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party held an Independence Day celebration on Saturday . 
in addition , several makeshift buildings have been constructed near the front gates to house the military intelligence officers who guard the entrance and carefully scrutinise all visitors . 
several other brick structures are being built , to house the several dozen people who have been living at Suu Kyi &apos;s residence over the past year . 
when the government renewed crackdowns on the democracy movement in May last year , just as a party congress was due to be held , several NLD members sought refuge in Suu Kyi &apos;s house to avoid being arrested . 
many of them have not left , and consider Suu Kyi &apos;s house their own . 
&quot; I live here , &quot; said one man proudly wearing a T-shirt with Suu Kyi &apos;s face on the front and a slogan calling for democracy on the back . 
&quot; This is my house now . 
in the past , bodyguards and some of Suu Kyi &apos;s advisers have been arrested after leaving the compound in what is seen as part of a continuing effort to intimidate people from getting involved in the democracy movement .
