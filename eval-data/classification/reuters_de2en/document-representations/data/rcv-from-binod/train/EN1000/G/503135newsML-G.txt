Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could be resolved swiftly but a Palestinian refusal to honour its peace commitments was holding up the process . 
&quot; The fact is that Israel is keeping its agreements and the Palestinians are not . 
the most central obligation of Oslo is to fight terrorism , &quot; Netanyahu told an Italian business forum . 
&quot; I believe that ... the abandonment of violence , the mutual fulfilment of four mutual objectives and the acceleration of the final settlement ... can bring us to a resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict within a short time . 
the so-called final-status talks are scheduled under the Oslo peace accords to be completed by May 4 , 1999 but Israel wants to finish this year in the hope of winning a better deal . 
Netanyahu said it would be &quot; a mistake to go through a protracted process where we will have friction every step of the way &quot; and said he would prefer to try to telescope negotiations into a six-month span . 
Palestinians view Netanyahu &apos;s offer of go-for-broke talks as a ploy to circumvent interim accords which already require him to hand over occupied land . 
eight towns have been handed over to Palestinian self-rule since a landmark 1993 peace accord . 
renewed violence has erupted almost daily since Israel began work on March 18 on a Jewish settlement on an East Jerusalem hill called Har Homa in Hebrew and Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic . 
Palestinians see the settlement as an attempt to pre-empt future talks on East Jerusalem &apos;s status . 
Israel says it can build where it likes in the city , captured in 1967 , which it calls its &quot; eternal capital &quot; . 
Netanyahu , who last week said he was considering forming a unity government to achieve a broad consensus for a final peace deal , said his rightist government was the only one capable of ensuring an overall peace deal was reached . 
&quot; This government will conclude , I believe , a final settlement with the Palestinians and it is only this government that will be able to do that because we are able to summon the confidence of the majority of the people and to bring the necessary elements of security that will make the peace work .
