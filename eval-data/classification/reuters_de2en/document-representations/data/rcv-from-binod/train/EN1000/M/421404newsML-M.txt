major Indian bourses closed slightly lower on Wednesday as buying by foreign funds failed to materialise in a day of volatile trade , dealers said . 
&quot; There is going to be some profit-taking at these levels , around 4,000 . 
this is really healthy for the market , &quot; said Basant Agarwal , head of equities at JM Share &amp; Stock brokers . 
&quot; The reaction gives a chance for general investors to enter the market , &quot; Agarwal said . 
stocks at the National Stock Exchange however , ended higher on fresh position building by operators at the start of the weekly account . 
at the Bombay bourse , many pivotals including ACC , BHEL , Sterlite and Hindalco hit their 25 percent ceiling on price increases in a week , dealers said . 
&quot; The market is consolidating gains , &quot; said Dinesh Khemlani , dealer at Bombay brokerage Khandwala Finance Ltd . &quot; Most shares are at their peak and there &apos;s no scope for further rise . 
the sharp price fluctuations in blue chip stocks kept foreign funds on the sidelines , thus offsetting market hopes of fund demand fuelling a rally , dealers said . 
&quot; They ( foreign funds ) are very selective buyers and have not jumped in the market , &quot; JM &apos;s Agarwal said . 
in the 1997 / 98 ( April-March ) budget presented to Parliament last week , Finance Minister P. Chidambaram slashed corporate and personal taxes , raised foreign portfolio limit in Indian firms and lowered import duties on a wide range of goods . 
the new reforms asserted India &apos;s commitment to continued economic liberalisation begun in 1991 and helped improve confidence among foreign investors , analysts said . 
in morning trade , the benchmark BSE 30-share index on Wednesday crossed an eight month high of 4,007.91 reached last week at 4,029.56 , but lost way and ended at 3,939.0 .
