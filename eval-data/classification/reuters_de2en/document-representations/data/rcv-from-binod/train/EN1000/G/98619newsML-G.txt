Hong Kong &apos;s former chief judge is gaining more public support as the person to run territory when the British leave next year , the South China Morning Post said on Sunday . 
a survey commissioned by the newspaper said Sir Ti Liang Yang had jumped into the lead among his rivals compared with the previous popularity poll . 
the opinion poll by Asian Commercial Research Ltd was conducted between October 3 and 4 , interviewing 406 respondents . 
it found Yang had more than 45 percent support among the respondents , a dramatic jump of more than 35 percentage point from a similar poll conducted in August . 
shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa , long tipped as a frontrunner to succeed Governor Chris Patten after Britain cedes Hong Kong to China on July 1 next year , received less than 25 percent , a rise of almost three percentage points from the August poll , it said . 
another business tycoon , Peter woo , who declared his bid for the post-1997 chief last Monday , received 9.5 percent backing from the public , it said . 
but the respondents &apos; favourite is not a contender : Patten &apos;s deputy Anson Chan , head of Hong Kong &apos;s powerful civil service , topped the popularity stake . 
poll data including non-contenders gave her almost 40 percent support while Yang would have only 21.5 percent and Tung with less than 15 percent . 
Hong Kong &apos;s first post-handover leader will be selected by December by a 400-strong body to be appointed by China &apos;s hand-picked Preparatory Committee , which is charged with transforming the British colony into a Special Administrative Region of China .
