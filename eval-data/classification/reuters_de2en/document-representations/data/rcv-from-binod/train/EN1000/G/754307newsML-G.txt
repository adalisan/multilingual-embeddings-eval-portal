Andrew Cunanan , the alleged killer of fashion designer Gianni Versace and four other men , is dead , police confirmed early on Thursday . 
&quot; All across the nation our citizens can stand down and breathe a sigh of relief , &quot; Miami Beach Police Chief Richard Barreto told reporters early in the morning . 
&quot; The reign of terror brought upon us by Andrew Cunanan is over , &quot; Barreto added . 
he said the thumbprint of a man found dead on Wednesday inside a Miami Beach houseboat after a four-hour siege by police matched that of Cunanan . 
Barreto said he could not immediately confirm that Cunanan had shot himself but said the police had not used their weapons upon storming the houseboat . 
Versace , who dressed the world &apos;s beautiful people in flamboyant and sexy couture , was shot and killed on July 15 at the gate of his oceanfront mansion in the trendy Art DECO South Beach area of Miami Beach , about two miles south of the houseboat &apos;s mooring . 
&quot; He made it 40 blocks from the original scene . 
a gun &quot; very similar &quot; to the .40-calibre pistol linked by the FBI to three of Cunanan &apos;s alleged five murders was found at the scene , he added . 
further details would be revealed later on Thursday , he said . 
Cunanan was on the FBI &apos;s 10 Most Wanted list of fugitives even before the Versace slaying . 
dozens of police including heavily armed SWAT assault teams surrounded the houseboat after its caretaker reported a man resembling Cunanan had fired a shot when he approached the site around 4 p.m. EDT ( 2000 GMT ) . 
four hours later , police fired tear gas into the houseboat and then entered the two-level dwelling . 
they met no response and could later be seen leaving in a relaxed manner . 
police had earlier said the houseboat was found empty after an initial search . 
the body appeared to have been discovered during a later more thorough search . 
local television said the owner of the boat was identified as a German citizen who also owns a gay health club in Las Vegas . 
police described Cunanan as a homosexual prostitute . 
Versace was also a homosexual but there was no confirmation the two men had a relationship . 
variously described as a gay prostitute down on his luck and a charming , intelligent chameleon who could change his appearance at will , Cunanan blurred the lines between the usual categories applied to multiple murderers , experts in the field said . 
they said Cunanan began as a &quot; spree killer &quot; set off by a desire for vengeance against a known victim , then developed a taste for cruelty shared by serial killers , and finally sought the infamy perceived by mass murderers . 
police said they believed he could have disguised himself as a woman to try to elude police during the nine-day manhunt he sparked . 
he was also wanted for the murders of his former lover Jeffrey Trail , 28 , in late April ; their mutual friend David Madson , 33 , in May ; Lee Miglin , 72 , also in May ; and William Reese , 45 , also in May . 
in an ironic twist , his death coincided with a passionate plea to Cunanan to give himself up from a close friend issued Wednesday by the FBI . 
&quot; The time has come for this to end peacefully , &quot; Elizabeth Cote , who said Cunanan was godfather to her children , wrote in the letter .
