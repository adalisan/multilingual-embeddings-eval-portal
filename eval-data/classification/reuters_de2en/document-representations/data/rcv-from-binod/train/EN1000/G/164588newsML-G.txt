Cyprus police on Monday charged a man with sexually abusing a six-year-old girl but only after her sobbing mother appeared on television to criticise the authorities for not acting sooner . 
Cypriot authorities sprang into action on Monday by charging the 47-year-old real estate agent from the southern coastal town of Limassol for the sexual abuse of a minor . 
the first hearing into the case is on Wednesday , a police spokesman said . 
&quot; There were unjustified delays in investigating this case and we want to know who is responsible , &quot; police spokesman Glafcos Xenos told Reuters , referring to the divisional police command in Limassol . 
the case was reported to police in April by the child &apos;s parents . 
after an initial remand of six days the suspect was released without explanation and the child &apos;s family were being kept in the dark over the course of inquiries , her mother told the private antenna TV station on Friday night . 
reports of child abuse are extremely rare in Cyprus .
