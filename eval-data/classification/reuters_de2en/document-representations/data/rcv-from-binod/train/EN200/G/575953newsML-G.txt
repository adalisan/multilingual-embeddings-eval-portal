Thai Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan on Monday denied rumours of his impending resignation stemming from his conflict with a major partner in Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh &apos;s coalition . 
Amnuay dismissed , in a TV interview , market speculation that the Chart Pattana Party , a major coalition party in the government , was unhappy with his six-month performance . 
the minister , speaking by phone from Japan where he was attending a meeting of the Asian Development Bank , said : &quot; I have never asked ( the prime minister ) to protect me . 
as you may be well aware of my working style , I never seek to cling to any position . 
some members in Chavalit &apos;s government suggested late last week that Amnuay could help halt the Thai economic slowdown and a prolonged stock market decline by stepping down . 
private analysts said the Thai economy is expanding about five percent this year , its slowest pace in a decade . 
Amnuay said he proposed to Chavalit before leaving for Japan that the prime minister consults senior government officials during his absence in monitoring the state of the economy . 
he said members of Chavalit &apos;s New aspiration Party and Chart Pattana , headed by former Premier Chatichai Choonhavan , have enjoyed good relations and they have worked closely in implementing economic policies . 
Amnuay is due back in Thailand on Sunday .
