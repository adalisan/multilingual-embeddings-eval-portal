all contracts maturing on January 2 , an unforeseen bank holiday in Singapore , will have to be extended to the next working day , the Singapore Foreign Exchange Market Committee said in statement . 
&quot; In the absence of prior arrangements or other agreements , banks should negotiate mutually acceptable interest rate adjustments , &quot; the statement said . 
failing an agreement on an acceptable interest rate , the contracted rate should be used . 
January 2 was only declared a public holiday in Singapore when the general election was called for that day on December 23 .
