convicted exam cheaters could spend up to 10 years in jail under a new law in a southern Indian state , officials said on Wednesday . 
the law was introduced on Monday in Andhra Pradesh state , where cheating and other unfair practices in academic examinations can now lead to jail terms of three to 10 years , and fines from 5,000 to 10,000 rupees ( $ 140 to $ 280 ) . 
the law followed the leaking of questions for the state &apos;s university entrance exams this month . 
examinations for as many as 750,000 students had to be rescheduled for May . 
on Wednesday , the state government announced an award of 100,000 rupees ( $ 2,800 ) for information on those responsible for the leak . 
State officials said the new law , which must be approved the state assembly , aimed to check organised cheating in public examinations , often aided by government officials .
