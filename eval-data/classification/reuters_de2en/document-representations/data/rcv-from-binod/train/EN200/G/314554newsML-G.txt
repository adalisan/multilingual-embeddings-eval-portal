Serbia &apos;s ruling Socialists lost a court appeal on Friday against a decision that verified an opposition election victory in the major city of Nis two months ago , an opposition leader said . 
the authoritarian Socialist Party ( SPS ) of President Slobodan Milosevic had contested the election commission ruling the day before in defiance of mass pro-democracy demonstrations in Serbia and pressure from abroad . 
Socialist diehards also vowed to challenge a pro-opposition ruling in Belgrade , snubbing a plea from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) to stop stalling and concede electoral defeat in all 14 towns at issue . 
up to half a million people have been rallying for almost nine weeks since the SPS nullified the unprecedented municipal election victories by the opposition Zajedno ( Together ) coalition , alleging unspecified &quot; irregularities &quot; . 
&quot; The municipal court in Nis ruled the SPS &apos;s appeal was unfounded , &quot; Zoran Zivkovic , local leader of the opposition Zajedno ( Together ) coalition , told Reuters by telephone . 
Zivkovic , who explained that he had received official notification of the ruling , said the SPS submitted its appeal on Thursday and the court rejected it a day later . 
the SPS could still take its case up to the Supreme Court . 
&quot; ... But this could not delay transfer of authority in the city as scheduled on January 27 , &quot; Zivkovic said . 
&quot; We will continue protests over Belgrade and other towns ( where voting was annulled ) but ( in Nis ) we must turn to the formation of power ( in Nis ) and work now . 
Miroslav Rajkovic , an opposition member of the multi-party election commission in Nis , said Zajedno had won a majority of 41 seats in the municipal assembly . 
persistent mass demonstrations by Zajedno and allied university students have rattled the foundations of the left &apos;s effective one-party rule stretching back to 1945 . 
about 20,000 Zajedno demonstrators rallied in Belgrade on Friday and opposition co-leader Vesna Pesic told them : 
&quot; We never expected our struggle to be easy . 
we must survive a lengthy state of siege . 
it will take us a lot of time to cross the moat and capture the castle . 
during a quick visit to Rome on Friday for talks with Italian officials , Zajedno leaders urged the West to intensify pressure for democratic change in Serbia after Milosevic issued a statement that ignored the crux of the prolonged crisis . 
Vuk Draskovic , one of three Zajedno leaders , told Reuters in an interview that international pressure had been inadequate . 
&quot; I am not quite satisfied with international pressure because that pressure is not very effective , &quot; he said . 
Western governments have threatened to ostracise Serbia in ways reminiscent of war-related U.N. sanctions lifted in 1996 unless Milosevic admits election defeat and embraces democratic reform . 
but they have taken no concrete steps . 
Milosevic , in a statement issued on Thursday night to the state-run news agency Tanjug , alluded to the protests over the annulment of opposition wins in municipal elections in November without saying whether these victories should be reinstated . 
ignoring the clamour for democratic change , he said &quot; political confrontations &quot; were damaging the interests of Serbian-led federal Yugoslavia and that disputes should be solved in a &quot; constructive and democratic &quot; manner . 
the fact that authoritarian hardliners in the SPS vowed to appeal against the adverse electoral commission decisions suggested Milosevic had not sanctioned the concessions himself . 
Milosevic also set his sights on a cabinet shuffle , apparently to purge unpopular ministers linked to corruption and mismanagement of Yugoslavia &apos;s shambolic state-run economy . 
but he skirted the issue at the heart of Serbia &apos;s political imbroglio despite a strong appeal from the 54-nation OSCE hours earlier for the opposition election wins to be respected . 
the European Parliament in Strasbourg urging the European Union and its individual member countries on Thursday to freeze relations with Serbia until democracy took root there .
