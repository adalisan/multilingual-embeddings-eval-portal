Egypt announced on Monday high-level trips to recruit European support for its attempt to revive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians . 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will have talks with French President Jacques Chirac in Paris on Thursday , Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters . 
the agenda will include the Middle East peace process , the European role in peace talks and diplomatic efforts to move the process forward , he said . 
Moussa himself will start a parallel European tour on Wednesday , visiting first Italy , then France for Mubarak &apos;s visit , and then London , the minister added . 
Egypt has been mediating between Israel and the Palestinians for the past month in an attempt to break the impasse which started when Israel decided in March to build a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem . 
in its latest contact with the parties , Moussa met chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat in Cairo on Monday . 
Osama el-Baz , Mubarak &apos;s senior political adviser and one of the main mediators , also attended the meeting , officials said . 
Members of the Palestinian delegation did not speak to reporters but Moussa said later : &quot; The gap still stands between the Israeli and Palestinian positions and Egyptian efforts to change the situation continue . 
the main obstacle to new substantive talks is the disagreement over Israeli settlement activity , especially in East Jerusalem , which is claimed by both sides . 
the Palestinians , backed by Egypt and with European sympathy , are demanding that Israel give a commitment to suspend settlement . 
Israeli leaders have refused to do so . 
&quot; If there is no movement on the settlement question , it will be a bad sign for the peace process , &quot; Moussa said . 
&quot; But that must not bring about despair or deprive us of hope , &quot; he added . 
asked to comment on last Tuesday &apos;s vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Jerusalem as Israel &apos;s undivided capital , Moussa repeated the Egyptian position that the status of Jerusalem was subject to negotiation by the parties . 
he noted that the U.S. administration held the same view , in spite of the House vote . 
European diplomats have also been mediating between the Israelis and the Palestinians , joining Egypt in trying to fill the vacuum left by an apparent loss of interest in Washington . 
a French draft prepared for the European Union summit in Amsterdam expresses deep concern at the impasse in the Arab-Israeli peace process and at the potential threat to peace . 
the declaration would urge all sides to resume negotiations on the basis of exchanging land for peace , the right of peoples to self-determination and the right of all to security . 
it would declare the willingness of the European Union , alongside the United States and other states of the region , notably Egypt , to help promote a resumption of talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
