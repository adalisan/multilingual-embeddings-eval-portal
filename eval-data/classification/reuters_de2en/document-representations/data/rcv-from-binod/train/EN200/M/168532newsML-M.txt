note : USDA Market News is working with the pork industry to revise U.S. pork price reporting to accommodate the new products that have affected price discovery . 
a revised report is being developed with a format that more closely reflects the range of pork products being produced by and sold to processors , retailers and end users . 
during the next few months a revised report will be developed one primal cut at a time , starting with hams . 
the revised report will run simultaneously with the unchanged current report for a minimum of one year to provide the pork industry and USDA time to analyze the reports . 
comments on the following primal ham section should be 
concurrently with the existing pork report for comparison .
