Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov restated on Wednesday Moscow &apos;s demands for guarantees that NATO will not move its military infrastructure into former Soviet bloc countries when the alliance expands eastwards . 
a Foreign Ministry statement issued after Primakov had held talks in Moscow with U.S. 
Undersecretary of State Strobe Talbott said Russia still hoped to sign an agreement on a new partnership with NATO in Paris on May 27 . 
but it also made clear that Moscow was still opposed to the Western defence alliance &apos;s plans to expand eastwards and that one of the prices for an agreement on the terms of a new partnership was changes to a treaty limiting conventional arms . 
&quot; The Russian side is pursuing the task set by the Russian president of preparing a full-scale binding document , hopefully by May 27 , &quot; the statement said . 
&quot; The minister explained that , for this , it is necessary to make more concrete the decisions made at the Russian-U.S. summit in Helsinki on not moving the NATO military infrastructure and on adapting the Conventional Forces in Europe ( CFE ) treaty . 
Talbott came to Moscow to prepare for a meeting between Primakov and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Thursday . 
the talks with Albright are to pave the way for talks between Primakov and NATO Secretary General Javier Solana in Luxembourg on May 6 . 
Russia bitterly opposes NATO &apos;s plans to take in countries from eastern and central Europe . 
but Yeltsin signalled at the Helsinki summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton in March that he realised Moscow could not block enlargement .
