fifty years ago I interviewed Mahatma Gandhi in the sanitised slum where he had his quarters among Delhi &apos;s &quot; untouchables &quot; , the lowest castes in the Hindu caste system . 
it was the most extraordinary interview of my journalistic life . 
the day after my questions went in , on Reuters paper , a telephone call said the Mahatma would be pleased to see me . 
it was a pleasant May morning , not too hot , and Gandhi came out of the bare room where he worked and slept to a patio . 
Mahatma ( Great Soul ) ? 
Gandhiji , a term of respect and affection ? 
we shook hands and he motioned me to a chair . 
Gandhi , renowned for his non-violent opposition to colonial rule , gave me a note pad and pencil and squatted right in front of me , saying : &quot; Right , now your questions . 
he read the first question aloud and gave his answer at once , starting : &quot; My reply : it would be a good thing if the British were to go today ; 13 months means mischief to India . 
I do not question the nobility of the British declaration ; I do not question the sincerity of the Viceroy , but facts are facts . 
and the facts are that India has been trained to look to the British power for everything . 
&quot; Now it is not possible for India to take her mind off that state all of a sudden ... The British will have to take the risk of leaving India to chaos or anarchy . 
this is so because there has been no home rule ; it has been imposed on the people ... It might have come about if we had gained a victory by force of arms . 
if the British were not here , we would still go through fire , no doubt , but that fire would purify us . 
clearly uncertain whether my hieroglyphics accurately conveyed what he had said , Gandhi asked me to read it back . 
&quot; Good , &quot; he said . 
and so through all the questions . 
he was most professional ; hardly a pause , very articulate , never needing to revise anything . 
then came the bombshell . 
&quot; Now , remind me Mr Campbell , which newspaper do you write for ? 
&quot; he asked . 
&quot; Reuters news agency . 
&quot; Reuters ... Reuters ... the imperialist agency ! 
&quot; exclaimed Gandhi looking surprised if not shocked . 
&quot; Oh , there has been some awful mistake . 
so you are not Mr Campbell of Moral rearmament -- the Oxford Group ? 
but there was no attempt at deception on my part -- my request for this interview and the questions were on office notepaper . 
it was an anxious moment . 
Gandhi might have asked me to hand over or destroy the pages of notes I had taken of his views on the British withdrawal -- &quot; Let the British walk off right away &quot; -- and other topics . 
Gandhi reminded me that dozens of foreign correspondents , special writers and authors were now in New Delhi and many of them had sought interviews with him and were prepared to pay large sums for the exclusive type of interview he had given me . 
we came to this understanding : I should treat the interview as an &quot; exchange between two humanitarians &quot; , write it up and let Gandhi see it before release for publication . 
then I must offer it to the Indian newspapers and state-run All-India Radio , through the Indian domestic news agency , the Associated Press of India , at the same time as I sent it to Reuters in London . 
I was convinced then -- and have had no cause to change my view -- that there was no misunderstanding and that Gandhi knew perfectly well that he was talking to Reuters . 
I typed the story and got a young reporter to take the copy in to Gandhi &apos;s quarters next day while I waited in the car . 
after half an hour the reporter reappeared , grinning . 
he handed me the copy , on which one or two very minor markings , nothing of substance , had been made together with this note in Gandhi &apos;s own hand : 
&quot; You have certainly carried out the spirit of my remarks . 
will you distribute copies to the Indian Press simultaneously or shall I ? 
almost every newspaper in India published the interview , many front-paging it , and some leading with a quote . 
Gandhi could be enigmatic and complex but there was no real contradiction between his choice of abodes in the imperial capital : a room in the mansion of multi-millionaire industrialist Birla where he was assassinated at a prayer meeting in 1948 , and the blighted slum of the sweepers quarter . 
by alternating he helped to bridge a chasm of Himalayan proportions in the caste and class system of Indian society . 
he showed he could have rapport with the magnates as well as with the untouchables . 
materially it mattered little to him where he was -- the slum was swept clean and at Birla Lodge he often slept on a straw pallet next to his spinning wheel . 
his worldly possessions amounted to little more than his sandals , steel rimmed glasses and an old Ingersoll watch .
