for the fourth time in the last five sessions , gains in the mining sector led the Lima stock exchange to a higher close Tuesday due to elevated international metal prices , brokers said . 
while the sector could see some technical corrections Wednesday , players expect a mixed session as electricity stocks were seen attracting buyers , they added . 
Tuesday , the General Index rose 0.89 percent to 1,740.88 points , while the blue-chip Selective Index climbed 1.06 percent to 2,514.02 points . 
in a total of 1,603 trades , volume was 27.7 million soles ( $ 10.5 million ) , according to preliminary figures . 
&quot; Mining stocks are rising because of higher metal prices and the fact that the ( international ) supply of zinc has fallen , &quot; Javier Alvares of local brokerage Finanval said . 
Peruvian mining companies have a special advantage of generally being polymetal producers , which means they can take advantage of price rises in various metals , Aldo Quintana of Interfip said . 
Polymetal miner Buenaventura was the most heavily traded stock Tuesday with 24.6 percent of the day &apos;s total trade . 
Peru &apos;s leading miner rose 1.26 perecnt to 24.10 soles . 
benchmark Telefonica del Peru remained stable at 6.31 soles in continued modest volume that represented only eight percent of the day &apos;s trade . 
electricity distributor , Moyopampa -- formerly known as Edegel -- rose 4.27 percent to 1.25 soles , in nine percent of the day &apos;s total volume .
