Malaysia &apos;s consumer price index ( CPI ) is expected to rise by 3.5 percent in 1997 after an estimated 3.6 percent gain in 1996 , the Ministry of Finance said on Friday in its 1996 / 97 Economic Report . 
the government said a combination of policy measures directed at managing demand , expanding supply as well as improving distribution and trading practices helped keep prices stable despite increasing pressures . 
tighter monetary policy , fiscal restraint and the abolition or reduction of import duties helped curb inflationary pressures , the ministry said in its annual report . 
the government last year also imposed restrictions on property sales . 
among the components of the CPI , the index for food showed the highest rise of 5.7 percent during the first nine months of 1996 , contributing to 57.1 percent of the overall CPI increase in the period .
