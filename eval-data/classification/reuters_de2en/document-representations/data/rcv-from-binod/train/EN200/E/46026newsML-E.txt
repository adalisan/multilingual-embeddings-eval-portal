Yugoslavia may tighten its import controls because of a growing trade deficit , a senior government official said on Wednesday . 
&quot; A rising trade deficit will force us to abandon liberalisation of foreign trade as a political commitment , &quot; Borislav Vukovic , assistant to the federal trade minister , told Reuters in an interview . 
&quot; This will lead to an inevitable step backwards , &quot; he added . 
the trade deficit was $ 1.16 billion in the first eight months of the year , with exports at $ 1.1 billion and imports at $ 2.26 billion . 
&quot; A wider gap is unsustainable for our economy considering the difficulties in financing it in the present conditions , &quot; Vukovic said . 
he admitted there were some business circles that would favour halting the liberalisation of foreign trade and returning to wider administrative control of imports , adding : 
&quot; But probably no one in the government wants to do that as it will contract the economy even more and damage our image in the world . 
the U.N. trade embargo imposed on Belgrade in May 1992 for its involvement in the Bosnian war sealed off the country from outside markets . 
the sanctions were suspended last November but a so-called &quot; outer wall &quot; of sanctions barring access to financial institutions remains in place . 
Yugoslavia , comprising Serbia and Montenegro , is seeking its return to the world &apos;s financial institutions to get access to desperately needed funds for its cash-starved economy . 
local economists estimate about $ 1 billion is required to kick-start production . 
but diplomats say any significant inflow of foreign capital is unlikely soon as Belgrade &apos;s full readmittance to the international community and access to funds is closely linked to a package of both political and economic conditions . 
Belgrade must cooperate with an international war crimes tribunal for Bosnia in the Hague and improve human rights for the Albanian majority in the Serbian province of Kosovo . 
the socialist government must also prove it supports privatisation and an open market economy . 
&quot; No access to the financial markets , no exports credits , no deals with ( international ) creditors makes it more difficult to finance the deficit , &quot; Vukovic said . 
&quot; Such situation cannot be tolerated for ever . 
analysts believe the current trade deficit is being financed from &quot; unidentified &quot; funds held abroad , but warned they were limited . 
any reliable figures are hard to come by . 
Vukovic said the government was aware Yugoslavia would have a foreign trade deficit for another four to five years . 
&quot; But the question is at what level ? 
Serbia and Montenegro , he said , did not have any problem financing a deficit of almost $ 2 billion in pre-war 1990 , when imports stood at $ 7.5 billion and exports at $ 5.7 billion . 
&quot; But our ( Yugoslavia &apos;s ) gross domestic product then stood at $ 28.6 billion and not at $ 15.9 billion as in 1995 . 
Vukovic said that 88.1 percent of January-July imports was unrestricted , 11.8 percent was according to quotas and only 0.1 percent of imports was subject to import permits . 
imports stood at $ 1.9 billion in the first seven months . 
&quot; Our intention to gradually liberalise our entire imports is jeopardised by an unsustainable deficit , &quot; Vukovic said .
