BAK , one of Switzerland &apos;s leading economic research institutes , said it had lowered its 1996 growth forecast for Switzerland due to continued weak consumption , the half-hearted depreciation of the Swiss franc and the lack of stimulus from key trading partners . 
BAK said in a statement that it had revised downward its forecast for Switzerland &apos;s 1996 Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) to a growth of 0.4 percent from a previous forecast of 0.9 percent . 
&quot; All in all we assume that Switzerland must face another year of recession , &quot; BAK said . 
BAK said it had revised down its forecast for private consumption this year by 0.3 percentage points to 0.4 percent from its previous forecast from March . 
but BAK said it expects the 1997 GDP to grow 1.5 percent as inflation , low interest rates and a weakening Swiss franc point to economic recovery . 
foreign trade should also help growth .
