Teetotallers take heart -- now you , too can share the benefits of a drop or two of wine , New Scientist magazine reported on Thursday . 
British researchers say tests show a powdered version of the non-alcoholic , healthy components of red wine can lower blood fats -- thus supposedly helping to prevent heart disease . 
research has shown that alcohol -- and some reports say red wine in particular -- can lower cholesterol levels . 
long-term studies show light to moderate drinkers suffer less heart disease than non-drinkers or heavy drinkers . 
some researchers in particular think substances found in red wine , known as polyphenols , confer strong benefits in addition to alcohol . 
but that is no good to people who cannot or do not wish to drink . 
so Norman Williams and colleagues at Papworth Hospital near Cambridge in England powdered up the polyphenols , the ingredients found in red wine that are believed to lower blood fat levels . 
they had 20 healthy male volunteers drink either red wine , white wine or take the non-alcoholic capsules every day for two weeks , and then measured their cholesterol levels . 
&quot; The results show that the benefits of the powder were very similar to those for red wine , &quot; Williams was quoted by New Scientist as saying . 
&quot; A lot of people don &apos;t like red wine so the ( extract ) could provide them with a way of getting the benefits .
