Midwest direct cash hog prices Friday were $ 0.50 to $ 1.00 per cwt lower in light trading , continuing pressure from this week &apos;s large hog marketings and lower pork prices , which eroded packer operating margins , livestock dealers said .

sales were light , with most packers reportedly having enough hogs for Friday &apos;s production . 
Saturday &apos;s slaughter was expected to be light because of tight operating margins , sources said .
