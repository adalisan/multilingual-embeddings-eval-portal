Rick Reed dueled Pedro Astacio through a string of zeroes before the New York Mets scored three runs in the ninth and beat the dodgers 3-1 on Thursday in the rubber game of their three-game set . 
Carlos Baerga and pinch-hitter Luis Lopez had RBI singles to make a winner of Reed ( 8-4 ) as the feisty Mets won for the seventh time in eight games . 
Reed limited the dodgers to three singles and three walks in eight shutout innings . 
&quot; It was a battle , &quot; Reed said . 
John Franco surrendered a leadoff Homer to Wilton Guerrero in the ninth , but set down the next three batters for his 27th save . 
Mets manager Bobby Valentine praised Reed . 
&quot; He matched Pedro Astacio pitch for pitch . 
he had great control of his slider tonight . 
the dodgers played without their big guy ( injured All-Star catcher Mike Piazza ) tonight , so we got them at the right time . 
the Mets recorded their league-leading 16th win in their final at-bat and moved into a tie with idle Florida for the National League wild-card spot . 
the dodgers have dropped six of their last nine but stayed four games behind first-place San Francisco in the NL West . 
Astacio was also brilliant in blanking the Mets for eight innings . 
he yielded six hits with no walks and eight strikeouts before giving way to lefthander Mark Guthrie ( 1-3 ) . 
&quot; You never want to take a pitcher out , but the pitch count was getting up there , &quot; dodgers manager Bill Russell said . 
&quot; You &apos;re not going to win many games scoring as many runs as we did . 
in Houston , Chuck Carr homered , doubled and drove in the go-ahead run with a single in the seventh inning to lead the hot Houston Astros to their season-high sixth straight win , 10-5 over the Montreal Expos . 
Carr , who hit his first Homer of the season in the fifth inning , snapped a 5-5 tie with a single in the seventh and later came home on a passed ball as Houston took an 8-5 lead . 
Luis Gonzalez went 3-for-4 with a Homer for Houston , who won for the ninth time in their last 10 games and improved to 11-3 since the All-Star break . 
Tom Martin ( 3-2 ) , the third Astros pitcher , got the win . 
Montreal ace Pedro Martinez yielded a season-high five earned runs and five hits , including two homers , in six innings and had his ERA rise from 1.67 to 1.91 . 
in San Diego , Craig Shipley had three hits and three RBI as the San Diego Padres defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 8-6 for their fifth straight win . 
Ken Caminiti and Shipley hit back-to-back homers in a four-run first inning . 
Shipley , making his first start since June 6 , also had a base hit in the third and a two-run single in the sixth for the Padres , who are 12-3 since the break . 
&quot; Ship hasn &apos;t started in a while , but he showed how valuable he is , &quot; Padres manager Bruce Bochy said . 
&quot; It &apos;s nice to put guys in there and not feel you &apos;re losing anything . 
in San Francisco , Midre Cummings and Mickey Morandini , the top two hitters in the batting order , combined for six hits and four RBI to lead the Philadelphia Phillies to a 7-4 win over the San Francisco giants . 
Cummings went 3-for-4 and Morandini went 3-for-5 , each with a pair of RBI as the Phils snapped a three-game skid . 
Wayne Gomes ( 2-0 ) allowed one run and one hit over 2 1 / 3 innings in relief of Tyler Green for the victory . 
Ricky Bottalico pitched the ninth for his 18th save in 21 tries . 
Joe Roa ( 2-5 ) took the loss for the first-place giants . 
at Colorado , Jamey Wright pitched his first career complete game and Dante Bichette homered and drove in five runs , powering the Colorado Rockies to a 7-1 rout of the Chicago Cubs . 
Wright ( 5-6 ) picked up his first victory since beating Philadelphia on May 3 . 
he allowed one run and six hits after a personal five-game losing streak . 
Sammy Sosa provided the only run for the Cubs with a towering Homer to centre measured at 472 feet , third longest ever at Coors Field . 
Colorado &apos;s Larry Walker went 2-for-3 with an RBI and three runs scored , raising his average to .394 .
