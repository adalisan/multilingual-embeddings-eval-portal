a Swiss team currently in Sri Lanka to investigate the local connections of a suspected Swiss paedophile arrested in Berne has taken statements of the man &apos;s alleged victims , police said on Monday . 
a Swiss judge and two police officers , who arrived in Sri Lanka last week , were collecting evidence to be used in the suspect &apos;s prosecution back home , Mohammed Nizam , deputy inspector-general of the police crimes branch , told Reuters . 
&quot; The Swiss team has recorded statements from suspected victims of the man . 
they are also searching for the parents of a young Sri Lankan boy who was with the suspect when he was arrested , &quot; Nizam said . 
the suspect , a resident of Sri Lanka whose name has not been released , was arrested in Switzerland last November and charged with sexually abusing several Sri Lankan children and with trafficking in children for sexual purposes , police said . 
Sri Lanka has been cooperating with Swiss authorities in a bid to clamp down on child abusers operating in the country , widely believed to be a popular destination for the world &apos;s paedophiles . 
a Swiss embassy official told Reuters another team of investigators from Switzerland was expected in Sri Lanka soon , this time on the trail of victims of a suspected child abuser deported from the island last month . 
Swiss authorities remanded 54-year-old Viktor Baumann after he was deported . 
a Zurich court is scheduled to try him for alleged child abuse in Sri Lanka . 
last week , a Sri Lankan court sentenced in absentia another Swiss suspect , Thomas Kaspar-wirz , to two years in prison on charges of child sex abuse . 
in February , a Sri Lankan court sentenced 58-year-old Swiss national Armin Heinrich Pfaffhauser to two years in jail for child sexual abuse . 
Pfaffhauser was the first foreigner to be convicted of the offence . 
he had pleaded not guilty .
