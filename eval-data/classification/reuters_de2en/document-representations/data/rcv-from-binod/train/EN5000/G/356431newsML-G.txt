penguins superstar centre Mario Lemieux put himself in some rather elite company Tuesday when he became the seventh player in National Hockey League history to record 600 career goals . 
Lemieux , who has said he will likely retire after this season , scored into an empty net with 56 seconds left in the third period as Pittsburgh beat the Vancouver Canucks 6-4 . 
with the penguins leading 5-4 and Vancouver goaltender Kirk McLean pulled for an extra attacker , Lemieux took a pass from Ron Francis , skated along the boards , and sent the puck into the empty net for his historic goal . 
Lemieux skated with his arms in the air to the sound of a huge ovation from the home crowd and broke into a smile as he reached his teammates on the Pittsburgh bench . 
&quot; It &apos;s a pretty special list , &quot; Lemieux said of the elite 600-goal club . 
&quot; You look at the names : ( Phil ) Esposito , Marcel Dionne , ( Wayne ) Gretzky ; to be included on that list is something I &apos;ll be able to cherish all my life . 
Pittsburgh &apos;s Jaromir Jagr picked up his league-leading 43rd goal in the second period and Francis broke a 4-4 deadlock with 8 : 32 left in the third for the penguins . 
the Canucks appeared to have tied the contest with 2 : 06 left , but Jyrki Lumme &apos;s goal was disallowed after the replay judge ruled Trevor Linden &apos;s right skate was in the crease . 
in Detroit , Jim Campbell scored at 5 : 15 of the third period to lift the St Louis blues into a 1-1 tie with the Red wings , denying Detroit coach Scotty Bowman his 1,000 career regular season victory . 
he will get his next chance to reach the lofty milestone Thursday . 
Nicklas Lidstrom scored a powerplay goal for Detroit just 3 : 33 into the game . 
Detroit goaltender Mike Vernon kept St Louis off the scoreboard until the third period , when Campbell &apos;s slap shot hit the crossbar and fell into the net . 
Vernon made 26 saves , while the blues &apos; Grant Fuhr stopped 25 shots in the goaltenders &apos; duel . 
in Phoenix , Rick Tabaracci stopped 21 shots for his third shutout of the season and Chris Gratton and Jason Wiemer scored first-period goals as the Tampa Bay lightning blanked the Phoenix Coyotes 2-0 . 
Tabaracci turned aside nine shots in the first period , seven in the second and five in the third for his 11th career shutout as the lightning halted a four-game losing streak . 
Gratton scored his 18th goal just 17 seconds into the game and Wiemer beat Nikolai Khabibulin with 1 : 38 left in the opening period . 
in Philadelphia , Joel Otto converted a cross-ice pass from Shjon Podein with 1 : 55 left in regulation to lift the flyers into a 1-1 deadlock with the buffalo sabres . 
Otto was streaking to the net as Podein threw the puck in front and he managed to get enough stick on the puck to push it past sliding buffalo goaltender Dominik Hasek . 
buffalo got its lone goal just over seven minutes into the second period when Alexei Zhitnik slid a cross-ice pass to Donald Audette , who rifled a wrist shot past Philadelphia netminder Garth Snow . 
Hasek made 28 saves , while Snow turned aside 22 shots . 
in Boston , Andreas Dackell &apos;s powerplay goal with 7 : 44 left in the third period lifted the Ottawa Senators to a 4-3 victory over the Bruins . 
Tom Chorske scored twice and Sergei Zholtok had a goal and an assist for the Senators , who converted all three of their powerplay opportunities en route to their season-high third consecutive victory . 
much-improved Ottawa is 6-2-3 in its last 11 games . 
Ted Donato had a pair of goals and Ray Bourque had a goal and an assist for the Bruins . 
on Long Island , Derek Armstrong &apos;s fluke goal with 6 : 48 left in the third period gave the New York Islanders a 4-3 victory over the mighty ducks of Anaheim . 
with the game tied 3-3 , Anaheim goaltender Mikhail Shtalenkov made a glove save on Doug Houda &apos;s shot from the right point , but the puck bounced high into the air . 
ducks defenceman Dmitri Mironov tried to swat the puck out of harm &apos;s way , but accidentally knocked it off Armstrong &apos;s shoulder and into the Anaheim goal . 
Niklas Andersson , Zigmund Palffy and Derek King also scored for the Islanders , who got 24 saves from Eric Fichaud .
