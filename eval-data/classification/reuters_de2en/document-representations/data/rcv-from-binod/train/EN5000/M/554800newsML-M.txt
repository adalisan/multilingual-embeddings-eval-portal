new Zealand shares ended modestly firmer after a quiet Thursday session on reasonable turnover . 
the NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 4.18 points higher at 2,266.11 on turnover worth NZ $ 59.1 million . 
Phil Hardie Boys at BZW said the market had struggled a little from weakness in the morning but there was still local and international interest . 
Hardie Boys said there appeared to be one overseas party in the market selling holdings in Bil and others , but the market was absorbing that pressure . 
he said the market faced a reasonable outlook over the next few days , particularly if bonds continued to rally , but he doubted it would all be one way . 
radio Pacific earlier said it had bought the operating assets of Radio Otago &apos;s seven North Island stations in a transaction worth NZ $ 3.53 million . 
Ceramco , which is soon to report its annual result for the year to March , gained eight cents to NZ $ 1.15 , but on light volume . 
last year , the ceramics and lingerie manufacturer made a trading profit , before abnormals , of NZ $ 4.82 million . 
it is expected to report a sharp decline this time around .
