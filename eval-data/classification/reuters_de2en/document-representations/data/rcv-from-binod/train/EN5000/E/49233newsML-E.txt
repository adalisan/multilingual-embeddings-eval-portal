Peru &apos;s Economy Minister Jorge Camet told Congress late on Wednesday the government was negotiating a $ 2.491 billion buyback under its soon to be finalised Brady Plan to restructure the bulk of its commercial debt . 
&quot; We are negotiating a buyback option that the Brady Plan contemplates for $ 1.275 billion of principal and $ 1.216 billion of interest , &quot; Camet said . 
Peru reached a preliminary Brady agreement with its bank creditors last October which , according to the government , will lead to an approximately $ 5 billion reduction on the total $ 10.657 billion owed . 
the government is still negotiating with the banks to finalise bond selections under the Brady Plan . 
Peru had announced a July 31 deadline for banks to choose their bond options and an August 9 date for the government to accept these formally . 
Camet told Congress the negotiations would be concluded &quot; in the next few weeks &quot; without giving reasons for the delay . 
the economy minister also told reporters after the congressional hearing the government expects the exchange rate to be 2.60 soles to the dollar at the end of the year . 
the current exchange rate is 2.485 soles to the dollar , up from around 2.30 soles at the beginning of the year . 
the government &apos;s 1997 budget estimates the exchange rate will average 2.70 soles to the dollar next year .
