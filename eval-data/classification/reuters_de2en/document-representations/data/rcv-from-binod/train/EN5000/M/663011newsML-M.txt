gilts ended with moderate gains on Monday , clearing key resistance along the way , but dealers said they doubted the market had much further to rally . 
the September gilt future settled 9 / 32 higher at 114-13 , having broken resistance at 114-08,10 -- an area which had thwarted the contract for the previous 10 days , technical analysts said . 
but dealers were sceptical . 
&quot; I hear what the chartists are saying but I doubt the market will rally too far from here , &quot; a senior gilts salesman said . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think we are much more than a half-point away from the top of this move .
