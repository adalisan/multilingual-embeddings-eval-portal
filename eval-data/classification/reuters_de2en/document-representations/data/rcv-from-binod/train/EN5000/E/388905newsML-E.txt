consumer prices edged up slightly in January , the Labour Department said on Wednesday , offering further evidence that inflation remains surprisingly in check as the U.S. economic expansion marches toward its sixth anniversary . 
the department said its Consumer Price Index rose only 0.1 percent , the smallest monthly increase since last summer , after rising 0.3 percent in December . 
it reflected in part the largest drop in food prices in 3-1 / 2 years , although this was offset by a moderate increase in energy prices , including gasoline . 
economists , who generally had not expected January inflation to be quite so tame , were delighted and surprised . 
&quot; This is not only good news , it &apos;s spectacularly good news , &quot; said Nicholas Perna , chief economist at Fleet Financial Services in Hartford , Conn . 
&quot; This is virtually no inflation at all , &quot; Philip Braverman , chief economist at DKB Securities Inc . , told Reuters Financial Television . 
but even with the often-volatile food and energy sector left out , the so-called core rate , which analysts believe more closely tracks inflation over the longer term , also rose only 0.1 percent , after rising 0.2 in December . 
the January results were better than Wall Street forecasts that prices would rise 0.3 percent in January and the core rate would move up 0.2 percent . 
&quot; It &apos;s almost as if you had a slight pullback in the pace of inflation at the consumer level , &quot; said economist Kevin Flanagan , a vice president at Dean Witter Reyonolds Inc . 
the overall January increases , while extremely modest , followed an actual retreat of 0.3 percent in wholesale prices in January , which was reported last week . 
it was the first decline in more than two years . 
analysts have been generally surprised that inflation has remained largely contained even though the U.S. economic expansion is one of the longest since World War II and shows no signs of a serious weakening . 
energy prices rose 0.8 percent after being up 1.5 percent in December , while gasoline rose 0.7 percent . 
the 0.3 percent decline in food prices was led by decreases in beef , fresh fruits and vegetables . 
the department said transportation costs declined 0.2 percent after being up 0.6 percent , while entertainment was unchanged after rising 0.3 percent in December . 
medical costs , a key factor in keeping labour costs under control , also remained largely quiet in January , rising 0.2 percent , the same as a month earlier . 
the department said the January 0.1 percent rise in the CPI matched the increase last June , while the decline in food prices was the largest since an 0.4 percent drop in June , 1993 . 
the U.S. economy will have expanded for six years at the end of March .
