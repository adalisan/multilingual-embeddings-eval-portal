Turkish police on Friday caught seven rebel Kurds responsible for a suicide bomb attack on a crack police force headquarters that killed four people in the southern town of Adana . 
a 17-year-old woman PKK guerrilla , dressed to look pregnant , blew up herself and four others in the attack a week ago -- the second of three such attacks by the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) . 
Interior Minister Mehmet Agar said one of the detained men -- a 38-year-old codenamed &quot; ISA &quot; , whom he identified as Bayram Yoruk -- had directly planned the attack and the other six had helped him . 
&quot; This man brought the terrorist girl to the scene of the incident at around 3 p.m. 
but the girl took fright and changed her mind about carrying out the attack , &quot; the Anatolian news agency quoted Agar as saying . 
&quot; He took the girl out of town and threatened her at gunpoint before taking her back some two hours later . 
and then the sad event took place , &quot; Agar said . 
more than 21,000 people have died in the PKK &apos;s 12-year-old battle for self-rule in the mainly Kurdish southeast , but the suicide bombings only started this year . 
the first attack came in July , after PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan warned of a wave of suicide bombings on the model of strikes by Palestinian group Hamas . 
the latest was on Tuesday , the national holiday celebrating the founding of the Turkish republic in 1923 . 
all three attacks were staged by female militants dressed up as pregnant women with explosives strapped to their waist . 
the spokesman said police had found letters showing that the Adana bomber , Leyla Kaplan , had tried to leave the PKK and had been questioned and dissuaded by Yoruk . 
&quot; They caught them through letters and documents found at the woman bomber &apos;s house , &quot; a police spokesman in Adana told Reuters . 
Agar said the PKK was using the suicide attacks as a way of punishing guerrillas it had decided to &quot; eliminate &quot; anywway .
