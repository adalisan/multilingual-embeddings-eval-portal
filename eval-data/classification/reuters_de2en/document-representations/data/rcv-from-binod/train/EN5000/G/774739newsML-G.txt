at least five people were shot dead in ethnic and sectarian violence in Pakistan &apos;s southern port city of Karachi and the central province of Punjab on Sunday , police said . 
four people , including a three-year-old girl , were killed in sporadic shooting incidents in Karachi , and a Shi &apos;ite Moslem activist was killed by gunmen in the Punjab town of Chichawatni . 
the girl and her father were killed by stray bullets when supporters of the Haqiqi faction of the ethnic MQM movement took to the streets in eastern Karachi to protest against the arrests of party members , the police said . 
as well as blocking roads and torching vehicles and shops , activists had fired in the air to create panic , police said . 
in a separate incident , the police said they picked up two bullet-riddled bodies stuffed into sacks from a vehicle . 
one of the victims was a member of the MQM , which represents Urdu speakers who migrated from India at partition in 1947 and their descendants . 
the Shi &apos;ite activist , Malik Ghulam Sarwar , was shot by three men on motorcycles as he opened his electronics shop at Chichawatni , 200 km ( 125 miles ) southwest of the Punjab provincial capital Lahore . 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack , but police said it seemed to be the latest in a series of tit-for-tat killings between militant groups of the majority Sunni and the minority Shi &apos;ite branches of Islam . 
more than 100 people have been killed this year in a surge of religious violence in the populous Punjab . 
Sunni groups accuse neighbouring Shi &apos;ite Iran of financing Pakistani Shi &apos;ite militants , while Shi &apos;ites accuse Sunni Saudi Arabia of aiding Sunni groups . 
more than 225 people have been killed in political violence in Karachi since March 1 , compared with about 500 in 1996 and more than 2,000 in 1995 .
