the jury in a soccer bribes trial ended its first day of deliberations on Monday without reaching a verdict and asked to see key video evidence again . 
the jury asked to review a film clip , which allegedly showed former Liverpoor goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar accepting money to throw a top game . 
because of a video breakdown on Monday , they will have to wait until Tuesday to see the film , which the prosecution says shows a packet of 2,000 pounds ( $ 3,250 ) being offered to Grobbelaar as an inducement to rig top-level games . 
&quot; Please retire and try to reach a verdict you all agree on . 
it &apos;s obviously preferable if you can do that , &quot; Judge Simon Tuckey told the jury of eight male and three women jurors . 
one juror was discharged early in the case . 
the jurors have spent seven weeks listening to the case against Grobbelaar and ex-Wimbledon keeper Hans Segers , both charged with accepting money to throw matches on behalf of an Asian betting syndicate . 
former Wimbledon and Aston Villa striker John Fashanu and Malaysian businessman Heng Suan Lim are accused of handing over the money to the players . 
Grobbelaar also faces a charge of accepting 2,000 pounds ( $ 3,250 ) as an inducement to throw a match . 
all four men deny the charges although Lim admits to paying the two goalkeepers for predicting the results of English and Dutch soccer matches . 
Tuckey ended three days of summing up by briefly running through the final statements by the defence and prosecution . 
at the start of his summing up last Thursday he told the jury not to be overwhelmed by the fame of the stars they had heard giving evidence and the publicity surrounding the case . 
much of the prosecution evidence came from Chris Vincent , a former business partner of Grobbelaar &apos;s who secretly taped the keeper as he appeared to admit to having thrown games . 
Grobbelaar said he had faked the admission to trick Vincent , who also told the court he had accompanied the player to London to receive 40,000 pounds in late November 1993 for throwing an away game against Newcastle . 
all four defence lawyers portrayed Vincent as a treacherous liar who had invented the story to make money from the case . 
on Thursday Tuckey said the jury should consider Vincent &apos;s evidence with caution because he had a motive for lying . 
Vincent told the court he wanted to destroy Grobbelaar , whom he blamed for the July 1994 collapse of a safari park venture the two men were trying to set up in Zimbabwe . 
the prosecution said Lim could not explain why he had received over 500,000 pounds from the Far East between 1991 and 1994 . 
the businessman said it was payment from a rich benefactor for the forecasts he had made . 
Fashanu received more than 200,000 pounds from the same sources between 1991 and 1995 but declined to testify in court . 
his lawyer said the money was for investment in business ventures . 
Segers admitted he had lied to police about 104,000 pounds he paid into a Swiss bank account from 1993 to 1994 . 
the keeper , fearful of being banned from the game for forecasting , said the money came from the proceeds of car thefts he had carried out when a teenager . 
he told the court the story had been &quot; absolute rubbish &quot; .
