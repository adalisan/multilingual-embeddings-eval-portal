Russian shares prices drifted lower in thin trade on Tuesday and traders said U.S. fears of another short-term interest rate hike and a general feeling of gloom on Wall Street had spilled into the market . 
they said the U.S. market would probably set the tone for Russian shares on Wednesday . 
the Russian Trading System 23-share index lost 0.92 percent from Monday to close at 298.52 on $ 21.4 million market turnover . 
the 10 most heavily traded shares in dollar terms all ended lower . 
Mosenergo regional power utility shares fell to $ 1.275 from $ 1.310 and national power utility dropped to $ 0.18717 from $ 0.19170 . 
regional utility Lenenergo dropped to $ 0.860 from $ 0.865 . 
&quot; Now we have to wait for the Dow Jones -- that kind of a fall is very serious , &quot; said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell &apos;s head of equities trading , Pavel Gronbjerg . 
the Dow lost almost 300 points in the previous two trading sessions and opened mixed on Tuesday . 
Gronbjerg said Russia itself was in relatively good shape , though he said the market was intently following possible union with neighbour Belarus , which is expected to sign accords on closer ties with Russia on Wednesday . 
but traders said selling was slight , and there was some buying . 
Russian share prices are often marked down as trading slows but large sellers are often scarce and the appearance of a large buyer can quickly spur the market .
