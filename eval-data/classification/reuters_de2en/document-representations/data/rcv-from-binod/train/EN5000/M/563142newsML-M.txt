U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Wednesday were seen steady to $ 1.00 per cwt higher , lifted by tight hog supplies , livestock dealers said . 
the light supply was expected to offset reductions in slaughter for the third consecutive week as packers attempt to mend unprofitable operating margins , they said . 
the weekly figure was down 3.4 percent from a week ago and down 10.3 percent from a year ago . 
Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota hog receipts on Monday were 88,000 head , 7,000 below the estimate , USDA said . 
estimates for Tuesday at 90,000 head also could run lighter than the USDA estimate , several livestock dealers said . 
Marketings were curtailed by a seasonal drop in hog supplies and active fieldwork by farmers . 
farmers were trying to get as much planting done as they can before rain moves into the central Midwest overnight on Tuesday , sources said . 
however , higher cash prices on Wednesday and rain could entice a few more farmers to bring hogs to market , some sources said .
