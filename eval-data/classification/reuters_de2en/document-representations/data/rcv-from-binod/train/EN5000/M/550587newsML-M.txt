* DLR ends above key 1.73 mark , 127 yen levels but off highs . 
* Rally in Dow above 7,000 , gains in treasuries support dollar . 
* Stg slips as UK election jitters grow ahead of May 1 polls . 
* DLR bolstered by growing prospects for the Fed to raise rates to slow economic growth after Q1 GDP up hefty 5.6 percent . 
the dollar was propelled higher against most major currencies on Wednesday by evidence of surprisingly robust U.S. economic growth in the first quarter and growing UK election jitters , dealers said . 
the dollar rallied to session highs after the Commerce Department reported the economy grew 5.6 percent during the first three months of this year -- its fastest clip in more than nine years . 
the news sent investors rushing to buy dollars after weak inflation data on Tuesday sent the U.S. unit tumbling for the first time in nearly a week . 
it also prompted celebration in U.S. stock and bond markets with the Dow Jones industrials index rising above the 7,000 level for the first time since March 13 . 
&quot; The upward bias in the dollar comes from low rates of inflation as measured by yesterday &apos;s number and high rates of growth as measured by today &apos;s Gross Domestic Product figure , &quot; said John Nelson , foreign exchange trading manager at ABN-AMRO Bank in New York . 
prospects for higher rates and a vibrant economy have been the main force pushing the dollar roughly 12 percent higher versus the mark and 10 percent higher against the yen in 1997 . 
on Wednesday , the dollar fell shy of besting its 56-month high of 127.16 yen hit April 10 , reaching a session high of 127.14 before closing at 127.09 / 14 . 
the dollar began Wednesday &apos;s session at 126.77 / 82 yen . 
meanwhile , the dollar rose to a high of 1.7348 marks before closing at 1.7308 / 13 , up from 1.7270 / 80 . 
the British pound fell to $ 1.6235 / 45 from $ 1.6280 / 90 as nervousness swept through the markets regarding the outcome of the May 1 UK general election , which according to polls will bring 18 years of unbroken Conservative Party rule to an end in favor of Tony Blair &apos;s Labor Party . 
&quot; The sterling sales are fairly aggressive and ... mainly in response to concerns about the election , &quot; said Mike Malpede , senior foreign exchange analyst at Refco Group Ltd . 
&quot; The polls indicate that the Labor party will win , but if the polls are wrong and the majority is slim , that argues for a paralysis in Labor government , &quot; he added . 
however , the pound was in part supported by a plummet in the Irish pound , which fell to its lowest level against sterling since July 1992 . 
the punt succumbed to strong selling pressure on rumors that the Irish central bank stopped supporting the punt late on Tuesday after heavy intervention earlier this week . 
traders said selling pressures had been mounting in anticipation of Ireland &apos;s perceived desire to enter Europe &apos;s drive for a single currency at rate significantly lower than it present trading level . 
in other trading , the dollar rose to 1.4730 / 40 Swiss francs from 1.4685 / 95 francs and Canadian $ 1.3975 / 80 from C $ 1.3969 / 74 .
