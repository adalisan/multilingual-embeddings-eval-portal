the focus will remain on South Africa &apos;s fragile rand this week in the absence of any significant domestic economic data . 
markets start the week edgy , digesting remarks by Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals on Friday that scrapping exchange controls could take four to five years -- ruling out the possibility of a &quot; big bang &quot; abolition . 
President Nelson Mandlea also injected fresh political uncertainty into proceedings with weekend comments that he has not endorsed his deputy Thabo Mbeki as his successor , saying it was a decision for the party to take . 
meanwhile , currency dealers are nervous following news that Finance Minister Trevor Manuel has appointed a committee to investigate the provision of forward cover in the foreign exchange market , in view of heavy losses this year . 
internationally , a meeting of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) and Japanese September trade and current account data will be the main highlights for financial markets in the coming week . 
while Wednesday &apos;s FOMC meeting is expected to bring no change in interest rate policy , it will still be a focus . 
&quot; The economic slowdown and continued good behaviour of inflation mean people are going to be fairly relaxed ( about interest rates ) , &quot; said Ian Harwood , head of strategy and economics at Kleinwort Benson in London . 
he said there would still be some residual anxiety that the Fed may raise rates , but it was most unlikely to happen . 
U.S. October producer price and consumer price data , on Wednesday and Thursday respectively , will affect bond market sentiment quite materially if they come in higher than expected , but forecasts were muted , analysts said . 
Harwood said Thursday &apos;s October retail sales and Friday &apos;s industrial production were also likely to show continued easing of economic growth . 
in Japan , markets will be looking for comments and indications about dollar / yen after comments from Japanese Ministry of Finance official Eisuke Sakakibara on Thursday that the dollar &apos;s recovery was about to end . 
&quot; The Japanese current account figures will be influential there , &quot; said Paul Donovan , senior economist at UBS in London . 
the September trade balance and current account data , to be published Monday , are expected to justify the shift in policy and indicate a stronger yen policy in the future . 
&quot; The weak yen policy has been very useful in stimulating the Japanese economy but has outlived its usefulness , &quot; said Paul Meggyesi , senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London . 
he said the pace of decline in the trade surplus was slowing and players would scrutinise the data for signs of confidence that trade trends were changing . 
Harwood said trade account data would be watched for a strong revival in exports and a deceleration of import growth . 
&quot; The trade figures might not be as conducive to good relations between the U.S. and Japan as people have been assuming .
