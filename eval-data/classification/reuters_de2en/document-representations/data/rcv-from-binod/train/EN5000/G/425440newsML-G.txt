Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu summoned Israel &apos;s cabinet on Thursday to ask support for handing over more West Bank land to Palestinians , following world accusations that he is hurting Middle East peace efforts . 
Israeli radio stations and newspapers predicted the cabinet would overwhelmingly approve the withdrawal of Israeli troops , perhaps by a vote of 11-5 with one abstention , during what could be a stormy and lengthy discussion starting at 1500 GMT . 
&quot; If we complete it tonight , I imagine that tomorrow we will already be able to talk with the Palestinians about our implementation process , &quot; Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh told Israel &apos;s army radio . 
Netanyahu , a right-winger elected prime minister nine months ago on a promise to get tough in talks with the Palestinians , is bound by an agreement reached in January to hand over more West Bank land by Friday . 
it was unclear how much land Israel would agree to hand over . 
a decision to pull back from only tiny areas could spark more friction with Palestinians already fuming over Israeli actions in Arab East Jerusalem . 
the United States , Europe and Arab states have joined the Palestinians in criticising Israeli decisions over the last 10 days to close four Palestine Liberation Organisation institutions and build a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem . 
Israeli officials suggest the next withdrawal -- expected in up to three areas of the West Bank including Halhoul near Hebron -- might be delayed until Palestinian President Yasser Arafat closes the PLO offices . 
Israeli police gave the institutions until Sunday to close or be shut down . 
Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it , a move not recognised internationally , to claim all of the city as its capital . 
Palestinians regard East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state . 
the sides are supposed to negotiate the city &apos;s fate in talks due to run until May 1999 . 
Washington , Israel &apos;s closest ally , has joined Egypt , Britain , Germany , Russia and European Union in criticising the actions . 
&quot; This is a time when it is very important that the parties take steps that will build confidence between them , &quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said on Wednesday after Israel decided to close the four Palestinian offices . 
&quot; It is therefore very difficult to understand why the Israeli government made such a decision at this time when there is a very difficult environment in the relationship with the Palestinians , &quot; Burns told reporters in Washington . 
Israel has handed over seven West Bank towns and most of an eighth to Palestinian self-rule since its landmark 1993 peace deal with the PLO . 
it has also given its former arch-foe civil responsibilities in some 450 villages . 
pressured by Washington , Netanyahu agreed to withdraw Israeli forces from rural areas in three stages over objections from cabinet right-wingers who view the West Bank as essential to Israeli security and the biblical birthright of the Jews .
