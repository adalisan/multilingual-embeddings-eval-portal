new Zealand &apos;s economic year climaxes this week with Treasurer Winston Peters &apos; Thursday budget an entree for central bank governor Don brash &apos;s main course on Friday -- the June Monetary Policy Statement ( MPS ) . 
Peters has said he will confirm a NZ $ 5 billion fiscal stimulus spread over three years , while brash is seen endorsing an easing of monetary conditions markets have already delivered . 
economists said on Monday the two events should , if served according to plan , provide a pick-me-up for an economy that has been spluttering instead of cruising , as previously predicted . 
brash said in the Reserve Bank &apos;s March Economic projections the economy had troughed , but subsequent events have shown it weaker than forecast and it may only now be touching the bottom . 
Friday &apos;s likely easing will be followed by another easing in September , Bankers Trust NZ chief economist David plank said . 
and the easing window will be opened wider , stay open longer and be closer later than previously been expected , he added . 
the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research &apos;s forecast is economic growth will recover from a 2.1 percent rate in 1996 / 97 to 2.5 percent in 1997 / 98 and peak at 4.3 percent in 1998 / 99 . 
there is much variation in the view of how aggressively the RBNZ will tighten next year as it anticipates the growth surge . 
ANZ economists predict a 150 basis point tightening from the latter half of 1998 while others predict only about 20 basis points in each of the last three quarters of 1998 . 
SBC Warburg economist Robin Clements said markets may test the bank &apos;s tolerance limits by pre-empting the September easing when they get an easing green light on Friday . 
&quot; My forecast is that the economy will be picking up early in 1998 and some time through the first half of 1998 the bank will start to have a bias towards tightening rather than easing , and by the end of 1998 we will be where we are now or even tighter . 
&quot; The June MPS , one of the bank &apos;s quarterly set pieces used to help it steer the economy towards its 0-3 percent government-set inflation target , is expected to sanction a 50 to 80 basis point easing of interest rates from 7.5 percent set for June quarter . 
the RB also uses the New Zealand dollar Trade-Weighted Index as a second indicator of monetary conditions , recognising that the TWI can influence both interest rate levels and inflation . 
monetary conditions , measured as a combination of indicator 90-day bill rates and the TWI , are currently 110 basis points equivalent below the level set by the RBNZ in March for the June quarter , and markets may ease even further on Friday . 
&quot; We are pushing through 100 points now and there is some indication that the market considers conditions still on the tight side , &quot; said Deusche Morgan Grenfell chief economist Ulf Schoefisch . 
&quot; I would expect after the statement that conditions would fall further from current levels . 
he expects the bank to formally ease conditions 75 basis points and to allow a range of 75 points either side of that . 
the RB in March forecast a steep downward track for inflation in 1998 -- to an annual rate of 0.8 percent -- and economists say pressures have diminished even further since . 
the labour market has softened , productivity is stronger , exchange rate strength has fed into import prices , house prices have eased and the March quarter CPI surprised on the downside . 
&quot; The whole package looks much more encouraging for inflation , &quot; Warburg &apos;s Clements said .
