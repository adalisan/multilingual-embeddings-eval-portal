the future of world champion Damon Hill and the future technical shape of motor racing were the subjects which attracted most attention on Friday as the Formula One circus relaxed in the sunshine on the traditional &apos; rest &apos; day at the Monaco Grand Prix . 
hill , whose arrows team are struggling to supply him with a car that matches up to his status and his talents , admitted he was frustrated at having failed to finish a Formula One race this year . 
at the glamorous street circuit , where his father Graham Hill was crowned &apos; unofficial king of Monaco &apos; after winning the race five times , he confessed that just finishing Sunday &apos;s 78-lap contest would be an achievement . 
and he made it clear that he was expecting a major improvement from the team he joined last year , after being dropped by champions Williams , if he was to consider extending his contract for 1998 . 
referring to his criticism of the team after the recent San Marino Grand Prix , where he crashed out of contention and was given a suspended one-race ban for dangerous driving , he admitted : &quot; It wasn &apos;t a threat at all -- it was a statement of fact . 
&quot; It was a statement about the situation . 
on the grid at Imola it was obviously not very pleasing for me to have another oil leak . 
it is not the first time it has happened and at most races this year we have had some kind of oil or water leak . 
&quot; My remarks were to inform people of the situations and the problems which we face as a team .... Everyone knows it has got to be fixed . 
we want to make progress -- not continually pull the car back into the garage . 
we want to do well . 
&quot; The arrivial of John Barnard should make a considerable change . 
I don &apos;t know how to quantify any changes because it is difficult to assess his performance over the last few seasons . 
I don &apos;t know how his relationship worked at Ferrari or how much control he had over the design of the car . 
hill avoided making any comment on suggestions that he was already in contact with several teams about a seat for 1998 . 
&quot; It is just a silly-season thing and I am not making any silly contributions to the silly-season stories , &quot; he said . 
the Williams , McLaren , Benetton and Prost teams have all been linked with Hill . 
hill , however , ignited the simmering debate over proposed rule changes for 1998 which require the teams to run narrower cars and narrower grooved tyres in an effort reduce speeds and increase the spectacle . 
current championship leader Jacques Villeneuve of Canada slammed the grooved tyres after testing them before the San Marino race . 
he said they were a joke , dangerous and the wrong thing for Formula One . 
hill , however , hit back . 
&quot; sure , there is less grip , the cars go slower and the braking zones are longer -- but that is the idea . 
at the end of the day , what is most important ? 
&quot; The racing or the speed of the cars ? 
on balance , I think the racing is the most important thing of all . 
with the grooved tyres , it is much easier to go off line so the track is wider too and that encourages more overtaking . 
&quot; I think it puts the onus back on the drivers to show what they can do with an unwieldy beast out on a track with more horsepower than grip . 
the man behind the new rule changes , International Automobile Federation president Max Mosley is expected to give his views on the controversy at a news conference in Monte Carlo on Saturday .
