local government officials broke off talks aimed at ending a bloody three-day prison riot in northern Colombia on Saturday after inmates refused to release hostages and lay down their weapons . 
Mauricio Pimiento , governor of Cesar province , accused a small handful of hardened and heavily armed convicts of intimidating more than 550 other prisoners in the jail in Valledupar and subverting the original purpose of the disturbance -- a protest at overcrowding . 
I want to reiterate the government &apos;s resolute position that until hostages have been freed we will not renew dialogue , &quot; Pimiento told reporters outside the jail . 
&quot; I would say almost the entire prison population is being held hostage and intimidated by a small group of between 10 and 20 with weapons , &quot; he added . 
four guards were killed in the jail revolt after inmates overpowered them , stripped them of their weapons and seized control of the compound on Thursday night . 
the majority of the prisoners were demanding an end to overcrowding but about 10 men , some convicted leftist guerrillas , demanded safe passage out of the prison by helicopter and political asylum in Cuba . 
Pimiento announced talks would be broken off after spending part of Friday night in the jail with regional human rights &apos; representatives and international Red Cross officials negotiating with riot ringleaders . 
the inmates originally seized 15 hostages but on Friday released two , a prison administrator and a 14-year-old girl . 
they indicated they would release other hostages as a goodwill gesture but later reneged on the deal . 
local police chiefs and Pimiento have described demands to free some of the prisoners as &quot; absurd &quot; and say there is little chance of them being fulfilled . 
police and army have surrounded the jail and Valledupar police chief Col. Alvaro Becerra said on Friday that a lightning attack on the compound by crack anti-kidnap police had not been ruled out . 
later on Friday President Ernesto Samper said there would be no negotiations until the prisoners had surrendered .
