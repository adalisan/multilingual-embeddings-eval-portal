in the broader market , however , advancing issues led declines 1,455 to 1,016 on moderate volume of 459 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
the market &apos;s performance encouraged analysts , who have watched warily as the broad market failed to follow the lead set by the blue-chip Dow stocks during their furious recovery from a month-long correction . 
&quot; The recovery , even in the S &amp; P 500 , has really been led by 10 or 15 companies , &quot; said Jack Shaughnessy , director of research at Advest . 
&quot; You really want many more stocks participating to have a sustainable advance . 
analysts said the Dow &apos;s pause was almost inevitable on the day before the wage and payrolls data , one of the few reports that draw almost universal attention on Wall Street . 
a robust report was sufficient to trigger the first sell-off in last summer &apos;s correction , and analysts said a surprising number , either way on Friday could easily produce another tempestuous session . 
&quot; Could we get another 100-point plus day either way tomorrow ? 
absolutely , &quot; said Charlie crane , chief market strategist at Key Asset Management . 
the balance of data this week has been reassuring to investors , showing a strong economy without inflation , the so-called &quot; Goldilocks economy &quot; because its pace is believed to be not too hot and not too cold . 
such an economy is particularly favourable for stocks , which benefit because earnings growth flourishes in a vibrant economy and interest rates can stay low when inflation is subdued . 
&quot; It felt like Goldilocks has been resurrected in the last few sessions , &quot; crane said . 
&quot; But if we get a really strong report tomorrow , she probably fades for a while .
