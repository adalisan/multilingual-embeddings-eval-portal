Ara bunkers were slightly weaker on Friday with lack of demand and good product supplies nudging prices lower , brokers said 
&quot; There &apos;s still a lot of product around , &quot; said one broker . 
&quot; Added to this is the fact shipowners appear to be holding back in the hope prices might go lower . 
&quot; Perhaps they &apos;ve been picking up material in Singapore or the States , &quot; said another broker . 
Mediterranean prices were relatively stable although trade was relatively thin , said local brokers . 
in Italy , Augusta 380 CST was quoted at $ 115 / $ 117 a tonne and in Spain , Algeciras 380 CST was put at $ 116 / $ 118 , both unchanged from Thursday .
