Thai rice prices firmed over the week on strong sentiment and rising local prices , trade sources said on Friday . 
the 100 percent fragrant rice also edged up to $ 680-695 per tonne from $ 660-695 on the same basis last week . 
news that Thailand had signed a memorandum of understading to sell 1.03 million tonnes of rice to China boosted sentiment . 
even though the deal remained tentative and more details needed to be ironed out , the market still considered it a strong supporting factor , trade sources said . 
the government estimated that exporters had secured additional orders under which they would have to ship around one million tonnes of rice between May-August . 
traders said export prices firmed due to rising local prices as well . 
&quot; There was no actual buying over the week , but the price rose partly because the quality of second crop rice improved and commanded better prices now , &quot; said a local trader . 
&quot; When the second crop rice started coming to the market , the moisture level was about 22 percent or more . 
now it is reduced to around 14-15 percent , &apos; he said . 
the industry said they expected rice exports to gather steam on improved demand after economic data showed sluggish exports during the first two months . 
according to the Bank of Thailand &apos;s figures , the value of rice exports during January-February dropped by 25 percent while the quantity dropped by 33 percent . 
&quot; Demand for quality rice from from China , Iran , and Iraq should help boost rice exports later this year , &quot; said an executive at one major exporting company .
