Jet-kerosene fuel premiums to North Asia for cargoes arriving in November have slipped below $ 1.50 on increased supplies , industry sources said on Wednesday . 
in the past week , a South Korean refiner had sold a dual purpose kerosene ( DPK ) cargo to Japan at premium of $ 1.45 per barrel to Singapore spot quotes and a jet fuel cargo to China at a $ 1.25-premium , both on a cost-and-freight ( c-and-f ) basis , said a trader at a Japanese trading house . 
both deals were for 30,000-tonne cargoes with the DPK sold to a Japanese refiner for arrival in mid-November and jet fuel to a Chinese enduser for arrival in the first half of November , he said . 
the deals are about 30-50 cents below the last cargoes sold into North Asia for late October arrival cargo , sources said . 
trading sources said the lower premiums were a reflection of the current market situation where supply is in excess of demand . 
apart from spot export availabilties from South Korea , traders are also looking to sell Middle East cargoes currently stored in tanks in Singapore , Guam and eastern China . 
refiners in Singapore also have high jet fuel stocks and have offered cargoes at parity to Singapore spot quotes . 
over the past few days the refiners have actively offered cargoes on a fixed prices basis down to a low of $ 30.20 per barrel free-on-board Singapore with a bid seen at $ 30.00 .
