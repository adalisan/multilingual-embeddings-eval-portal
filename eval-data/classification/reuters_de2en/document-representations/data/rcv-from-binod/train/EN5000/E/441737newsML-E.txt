the following is a selection of economists and analysts initial reaction to Spain &apos;s February Consumer Price Index , which fell 0.1 percent from January for a 2.5 percent rise year on year , versus 2.9 percent in January . 
it &apos;s good in terms of practically all the components , except in services . 
there &apos;s a high probability that the Bank of Spain will cut rates by 25 basis points at tomorrow &apos;s repo or at the next one . 
in any case , we think that , there &apos;ll be a cut in March . 
inflation data for the last two months gives sufficient room for it &quot; 
&quot; Both headline and core inflation fell very impressively , but service inflation is still stubborn ( up 0.4 percent versus January ) and this is what is worrying the Bank of Spain . 
CPI declined so much mainly due to the fall in processed food , which is due , I suppose , to the olive oil fall . 
but I do not think the Bank of Spain --which has in mind its 1998 inflation target-- would cut rates on the basis of that fall . 
in terms of the rate outlook , I guess they &apos;re still worried about service inflation . 
the labour reform isn &apos;t ready yet . 
they will wait to see the peseta more stable and they would like to have more deficit numbers . 
&quot; These are very good data , with CPI falling more than expected . 
above all I &apos;d highlight the fall in underlying inflation year on year to 2.3 percent . 
at first glance , the main reason seems to be processed foods . 
we wouldn &apos;t be surprised to see inflation fall even further in the next few months . 
the data shows the Bank of Spain has room to cut rates at Friday &apos;s repo . 
after this February data it &apos;s very likely inflation this year can stay below 2.5 percent on average . 
so it &apos;s now very likely that the Bank of Spain could cut its ( six percent ) key money market rate by at least 25 basis points , if not more . 
&quot; The data is great in almost all the components . 
tomorrow the Bank of Spain will cut its key money rate 25 basis points &quot; 
&quot; It &apos;s a relatively good figure , below forecasts , but the only problem is that February was the last month of a favourable cycle , as from next month the comparative data ( from last year ) will be very low . 
the market &apos;s response has been lukewarm . 
the bank of Spain could give a signal and cut rates by a quarter of a point , but I see a 60-40 chance that it won &apos;t .
