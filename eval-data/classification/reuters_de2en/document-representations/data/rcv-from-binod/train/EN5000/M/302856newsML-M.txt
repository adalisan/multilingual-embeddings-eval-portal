Japanese stocks recovered strongly on Monday in a rollercoaster session , clawing back some of the huge losses sustained last week and lifting other Asian markets . 
after initially hitting an early low of 17,019.56 , Japan &apos;s key Nikkei 225 index ended a hectic session up 815.14 points , or 4.71 percent , at 18,118.79 -- its first rally in a week . 
Monday &apos;s sharp gain was more than enough to offset what the benchmark lost on Friday , when it suffered the biggest single-day drop in two years . 
it lost more than 2,000 points last week because of spreading gloom over the government &apos;s ability to keep the nation &apos;s economic recovery on track . 
analysts called the rebound &quot; technical &quot; , however , and said the market was still gripped by worries about the economy and the health of some financial institutions . 
the rally was also bolstered by a report that a senior official of Japan &apos;s ruling party had called for measures to deal with weak stock prices . 
but a top government official quickly denied that any bailout measures would be taken by the government . 
Hong Kong stocks rose on solid gains in the banking sector , and pared losses in property counters , brokers said . 
the Hang Seng Index closed 97.71 points higher at 13,289.21 . 
Edwin Cheung , dealing director at Taiwan Securities , said buying was mainly focused on banking stocks as investors took action ahead of earnings announcements expected soon . 
the surge in Tokyo also provided an afternoon lift . 
&quot; Nobody needs a crisis in the region so the rebound in Japan is certainly helpful , &quot; said Kent Rossiter , institutional sales manager at Nikko Securities . 
stocks in Seoul ended Monday &apos;s trading at exactly Saturday &apos;s closing of 659.54 points as fears over strikes matched improving sentiment in financial stocks , brokers said . 
South Korea faces its biggest strikes ever on Wednesday when the nation &apos;s two main union umbrella groups plan to call out an all-out strike in protest at a new labour law . 
brokers said many investors were optimistic that a last-minute solution , or at least some indication of an early settlement , to the stoppages could be reached . 
Taiwan &apos;s main stock index closed higher for the third straight day , rising to a six-year high to end up 71.40 points , or one percent , at 7,189.47 . 
brokers cited healthy rotational rises in construction shares , textiles , electrics , electronics and plastics . 
the index has rebounded for six of the past seven sessions since taking a 1.64 percent plunge on January 4 after Taiwan provincial governor James Soong &apos;s shock resignation to protest moves to dismantle his largely redundant administration . 
the political uncertainties have waned since President Lee Teng-hui met Soong last week , brokers said . 
Thai stocks closed sharply lower in moderate trade as investors sold on concerns that the government faced difficulty implementing plans to assist the Thai property sector , analysts said .
