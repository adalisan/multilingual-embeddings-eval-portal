Bangladesh , facing severe air pollution in major cities including the capital Dhaka , will set up an &quot; Environment Court &quot; to punish polluters , government officials said on Monday . 
they said the decision was taken at a high-level meeting on Sunday chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , who ordered the phasing-in of natural gas to replace petrol and diesel fuel to minimise pollution . 
the proposed court , whose exact functions were not spelled out , will deal with violations of environmental guidelines such as the operation of aging and unfit vehicles emitting pollution , officials said . 
they also said it would be empowered to impose tougher penalties , including jail terms , although those penalties were still being worked out . 
similar offences are now punishable only by fines . 
&quot; Air pollution in Dhaka , a city of nine million people , has reached an alarming level . 
it &apos;s one of the world &apos;s worst , and has crossed all safety limits , &quot; Saiyid Mosharraf Husain , director-general of the department of environment ( DOE ) , told Reuters recently . 
the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) has set the maximum acceptable limit of suspended particulate matter ( SPM ) at 200 micrograms per cubic metre of air . 
in Dhaka , the SPM reading was recently found as high as 1,800 micrograms . 
&quot; Motor vehicles are 80 percent responsible for this hazard . 
most are not fit , use leaded fuel and emit black smoke containing toxic carbon monoxide , &quot; said Husain . 
vehicles in Bangladesh use leaded fuel because the country &apos;s lone refinery is not equipped to produce lead-free fuel . 
energy Minister Nooruddin Khan said at Sunday &apos;s meeting that the government was now importing lead-free petrol and diesel . 
consumers are being encouraged to use compressed natural gas in vehicles , which will not only help protect the environment but also prove cheaper , he said .
