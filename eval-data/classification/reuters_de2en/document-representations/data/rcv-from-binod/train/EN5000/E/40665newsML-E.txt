former Federal Reserve bank presidents appear to favor a tightening of credit policy this month , while former governors of the Fed Board expect policymakers to keep short-term interest rates steady . 
the sentiment , analysts said , reflects an old market perception that regional Fed heads usually want to respond to incipient signs of inflation more quickly than Fed governors , who are seen as the patient leg of the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) . 
&quot; I &apos;ve been told by people who &apos;ve watched the Fed closely over the last decade that the presidents tend to be more hawkish ( than the governors ) , &quot; said Josh stiles , senior bond strategist at consulting firm I.D.E.A. 
Inc . 
in a series of recent interviews with Reuters , former Fed officials expressed mixed opinions about the future of the country &apos;s monetary policy . 
Ex-Fed Governor John Laware said he expected no increase in short-term interest rates at the next meeting of the FOMC on September 24 . 
Laware also said the Fed may decide to hold off on a rate hike until after the November 5 presidential election . 
former Fed Governor Lyle Gramley said he sees less than an even chance the central bank will act on interest rates at the September 24 gathering . 
meanwhile , the former Atlanta Fed bank President Robert Forrestal said he expected the central bank to increase the fed funds rate by 25 basis points at the next FOMC meeting . 
behind his reasoning , Forrestal said , is the need to stem a possible inflation rise before pressures actually take hold . 
the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Richard Syron agreed with Forrestal , saying that he expected the Fed to hike the fed funds rate by a quarter point by late September . 
the Fed last changed monetary policy in January , when the central bank cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to its current target rate of 5.25 percent . 
the difference in opinion among ex-Fed officials might give financial markets a hint as to what is going on inside the FOMC . 
&quot; It is pretty interesting and I do think you have this divide , &quot; said Matthew Alexy , chief markets strategist at CS First Boston Corp. &quot; A lot of people are arguing it &apos;s not necessarily between governors and bank presidents but between governors and staff members , &quot; Alexy added . 
analysts said that at least three current voting members of the FOMC are perceived to be in favor of a tightening of the monetary policy in September . 
coincidentally or not , experts added , they are all regional Fed presidents . 
stiles of I.D.E.A. 
said he believes Minneapolis Fed head Gary Stern is in favor of a tightening . 
that sentiment became evident after the release of the July FOMC minutes , where Stern was the only member of the Committee to vote in favor of an interest rate hike in July . 
stiles said Robert McTeer , the president of the Dallas Fed , is also perceived to be in favor of higher rates , while Jerry Jordan , president of the Cleveland Fed , &quot; probably would be &quot; in the tightening camp as well . 
the other two regional presidents of the Federal Reserve , who are voting members , are New York Fed chief William McDonough and Edward Boehne , head of the Philadelphia Fed . 
analysts said Boehne tends to be a centrist , while McDonough is perceived to be more in line with Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan . 
on the other hand , analysts said Vice Chairman Alice Rivlin and Fed Governor Laurence Meyer are perceived as less inclined to seek a rate hike .
