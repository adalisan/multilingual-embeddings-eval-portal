U.S. spot propane prices eased down again in quiet late trade on Tuesday , weakened by lower values for NYMEX crude oil futures , players said . 
over the past two days spot propane prices have fallen about 2.00 cents in each of the two major hubs , the Gulf Coast and Midwest . 
part of the decline is due to the downturn in NYMEX December crude oil futures . 
&quot; People are worried that crude may crater , and if it does all of our products will look extremely overvalued , &quot; said a Conway trader . 
part of that worry stems from demand continuing to be strong for propane in the Midwest for drying corn crops . 
traders said they expect the demand to remain heavy for the next two weeks . 
in the U.S. Gulf Coast , the bid price for spot propane in Mont Belvieu , Texas , edged down a quarter cent from midday to 51.50 cents a gallon . 
sellers remained at 52.00 cents , 2.00 cents below Friday levels . 
Conway , Kansas hub material dipped a quarter cent to 53.50 / 53.75 cents .
