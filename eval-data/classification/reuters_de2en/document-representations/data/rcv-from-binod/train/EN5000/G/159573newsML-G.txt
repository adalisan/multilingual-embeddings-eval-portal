narrow odds are not the only sign Irish stayer Oscar Schindler is firm favourite to win next Tuesday &apos;s Melbourne Cup -- science likes the look of him too . 
an animal behaviouralist who helped develop a method of helping punters pick winners said on Friday his money was also on the giant chestnut to win the classic . 
they showed him on the news the other night and paraded him before the media and he just looked stunning , &quot; said Geoff Hutson , of the University of Melbourne . 
&quot; His hind quarters were rippling with muscles .... I was pretty impressed and I think a lot of other people will be too . 
Hutson and colleague Marie Haskell published their formula in New Scientist magazine this week after studying the behaviour of over 800 horses shortly before races and then comparing their demeanour against performance . 
their six-point plan aims to separate the also-rans from the champions by looking for behaviour that bears the hallmarks of a loser , like resisting the reins or tossing of the head . 
&quot; It will just depend how he handles the pressure on the day , &quot; Hutson said of Oscar Schindler , at 5-2 the clear favourite to win the 3,200 metre ( two-mile ) handicap . 
&quot; It &apos;s like a wall of noise ( before the start ) . 
there &apos;s nothing like it .... If I see him break out in a sweat and starts tossing his head around , I &apos;ll start to get nervous myself . 
named after a Hollywood movie about a German industrialist who saved more than 1,000 Polish Jews from Nazi death camps , the horse &apos;s recent form includes a win in the Irish St Leger and a fast third in the Prix de L &apos;Arc de Triomphe last month . 
leading Australian trainer gai Waterhouse , who trained last year &apos;s runner-up Nothin &apos; Leica Dane , did not need any help from science to judge Oscar Schindler the clear favourite . 
&quot; I think the Irish horse has just got 50 lengths on the Australian and New Zealand horses -- I think Oscar Schindler is the horse to beat , &quot; she said this week . 
Australia virtually stops for the running of the A $ 2.2 million Cup and the host state of Victoria declares the day a public holiday . 
Australians wagered A $ 81 million through off-course bookmakers on the race here last year -- or A $ 4.50 for every man , woman and child -- and millions of dollars more in office sweepstakes .
