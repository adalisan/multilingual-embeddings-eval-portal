the leader of the biggest party in Italy &apos;s centre-left government said in remarks published on Tuesday that new elections should be called if Prime Minister Romano Prodi , who could face judicial proceedings , should fall . 
&quot; If this government should fall , we would hold elections again , &quot; Massimo D &apos;Alema , leader of the ex-communist Democratic Party of the Left , told weekly magazine Oggi in an interview . 
a summary of his remarks was released in advance of publication . 
bond traders in Milan said the comments were behind a sharp late fall in bond prices . 
at one stage , the LIFFE December BTP futures contract slid some 50 basis points but recovered to post just an eight BP fall to 128.00 by the official close . 
d &apos;Alema ruled out the possibility of a deal between the center-left and Silvio Berlusconi &apos;s centre-right opposition bloc in the event of a government crisis . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think that would be understood by the electorate , &quot; he said , adding that the greatest accord between both sides would be &quot; to let those who won the elections govern and to tackle institutional reforms together &quot; . 
Prodi , who has said he has done no wrong , has found widespread support among politicians and there have been few calls for him to step down . 
Italian news agencies on Monday broke news that a deputy public prosecutor in Rome had asked for Prodi to be tried for alleged abuse of office and conflict of interest relating to the time of his chairmanship of state holding company IRI . 
prosecutors allege irregularities concerning the sale by IRI in October 1993 of food company Cirio .
