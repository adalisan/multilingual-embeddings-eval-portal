the remarkable Tiger Woods sets out to continue a couple of special streaks when the U.S. Open golf championship gets underway Thursday at Congressional Country Club . 
the 21-year-old Woods won the Masters with a record score and by a record 12-stroke margin , and now looks to add the second leg of the Grand Slam and make it seven years in a row that he claims a national title . 
Woods , the youngest Masters winner ever and the first black player to win a major title with his Augusta triumph , won three successive U.S. 
junior titles and followed that with an unprecedented three straight U.S. 
amateur championships before turning pro last year . 
I figure there &apos;s no point in going to a tournament if you don &apos;t think you can win . 
all has not gone smoothly off the course for Woods , who has been criticised about his scheduling and about some off-colour joke-telling attributed to him in a magazine article . 
&quot; People fail to realise that when you &apos;re 21 or when you &apos;re young , period , you &apos;re going to make mistakes , &quot; he told a news conference after a practice round at Congressional . 
unfortunately , it &apos;s going to happen . 
some observers feel Woods will also have to grow in golfing terms and learn his way around particularly stiff tests like a U.S. Open course rigged with wretched rough . 
British Open champion Tom Lehman , who along with defending U.S. Open champion Steve Jones will play the first two rounds with Woods , does not agree . 
&quot; A guy who is a great player , it doesn &apos;t matter where you put him . 
you can put him on the moon , he can still play good golf . 
tiger is no different , &quot; said Lehman , who nearly won the U.S. title last year , bogeying the final hole to finish one stroke back . 
&quot; He &apos;s a great player and he &apos;s going to play this course just fine , even rough and all . 
I don &apos;t think that he &apos;s going to win by 12 shots , but it &apos;s not like he can &apos;t handle this course , because he can . 
to say he &apos;s not one of the favourites is ridiculous . 
Lehman said he was looking forward to the grouping and knew what to expect . 
&quot; I know a lot of people like Steve Jones , and a lot of people like me , but Tiger is the main event of that threesome . 
&quot; I think he has earned whatever he has received to this point . 
I think he &apos;s done something that no one else has done . 
he has done a lot of things that no one else has done , &quot; Lehman said . 
&quot; Everything that &apos;s come his way , every accolade he &apos;s received , I believe he &apos;s earned . 
Lehman , as well as other leading players , have had nothing but praise for Woods in the days leading up to the Open . 
the soft-spoken Lehman elaborated on comments he had made about other players being overlooked in the wake of the frenzy over Woods , who receives as many as 4,000 fan letters a week . 
&quot; You know , you look at the NBA , and you &apos;ve got Michael Jordan , who is head and shoulders above anybody else . 
he &apos;s the biggest star of the league , but it &apos;s a league full of stars . 
&quot; And golf is the same way . 
if Tiger Woods is the biggest star out here , there are other stars too , other great players . 
so let &apos;s make sure everybody gets their due .
