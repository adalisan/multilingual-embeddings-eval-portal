the aluminum being taken out of LME warehouses was destined for consumers and not merely being transferred to a &apos; stealth stockpile &apos; , industry analyst Stewart Spector said in his latest monthly review . 
the slim forward month premium over cash aluminum price or contango on LME does not make it economic to handle and transport metal from one location to another , Spector said . 
&quot; Therefore we discount the constant talk about the transfer of LME warranted ingot to some &quot; stealth stockpile &quot; as an irrational rumor , &quot; Spector said . 
Aluminum consumers have destocked and are seeing rising orders which needed more metal to fulfill . 
&quot; Thus , in our opinion , the metal moving out of the LME warehouses is for real , &quot; Spector said . 
nevertheless , the aluminum price has yet to reflect declining stocks because of three factors which have impeded it - unwarranted consignment inventory of ingot financed by the banks , the supposed large LME &apos; strangle &apos; aluminum options position held by L G metals Corp , and the fall in copper prices which dampened the base metals complex , Spector said . 
it could take another month or so for the banks to unwind their mismatched forward positions , and the L G metals aluminum positions have been turned over to a major investment banker to be worked out , Spector said . 
&quot; However , the sharp drop in copper and aluminum prices on heavy volume in the last week should have allowed the banker to have closed out those positions , &quot; Spector said .
