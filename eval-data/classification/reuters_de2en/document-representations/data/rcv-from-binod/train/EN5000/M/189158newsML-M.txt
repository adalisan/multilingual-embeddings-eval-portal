MGE spring wheat futures ended mostly lower in what traders said was an adjustment to the December / March spread . 
traders said softer cash values in Minneapolis tugged at the December contract , and pressure also came from CBOT wheat , which ended lower on late speculative selling tied to signals the market was overbought . 
the Dec / March spread had closed sharply out of line on Wednesday as closing market activity widened it to 22 cents per bushel , traders said . 
on Thursday , the spread narrowed to close at 16-1 / 4 cents . 
MGE spring wheat closed one cent a bushel higher to seven cents lower , with December down seven cents at $ 4.09 . 
country hedging bought one million Dec and FIMAT bought 1.1 million March . 
Benson-Quinn bear-spread at least one million March / Dec at 17 to 18 cents . 
MGE barley closed 10 to 16 cents per cwt higher , with December up 16 cents at $ 6.71 .
