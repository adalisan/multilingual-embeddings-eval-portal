the UK spot natural gas market was quiet and thin on Thursday , traders and brokers said , although prices , especially in the 1997 gas year , continued to weaken . 
most of the trade was in the prompt period , with deals seen for the day ahead and several other short-term periods in the balance of June . 
further out , July was traded at the low end of existing ranges , with Q3 , Q4 and Q1 all ticking down slightly . 
the gas year followed them down . 
although it was not confirmed by the close , there were widespread rumours that the year traded at 12.70 pence a therm for 25,000 th / d at the NBP . 
by the close , according to one broker it was offered at 12.70 pence , with bids coming from 12.60 pence . 
describing a quiet day , one trader said : &quot; It &apos;s slightly weaker , though not much , but I doubt if that much traded . 
&quot; He added that there was still a bearish mood on the market , even though bids were slightly stronger in the afternoon than they had been in the morning . 
one dealer said he did not think the market had bottomed out yet , adding that he and others were watching closely for the moment when it looked as if prices may start to bounce in order to purchase more gas at the bottom of the market . 
the quiet and weak tone of the market was reflected in futures , where nothing traded at all for the first time this week . 
dealers said there had been a system sell on the flexibility mechanism at around 9.33 pence a therm , but this had little impact on prices on the day ahead market , where 11.00 pence was traded at the NBP . 
short term gas was also relatively strong at St Fergus , where trade was done at 10.75 pence a therm for the weekend and at 10.90 pence for the first two days of next week . 
on Wednesday Transco reported no activity on the flexibility mechanism , with an SAP of 0.4019 p / kWh ( around 11.78 pence a therm ) , the same level as the 7-day rolling average . 
the 30 day average was 0.4000 p / kWh , or around 11.72 pence a therm .
