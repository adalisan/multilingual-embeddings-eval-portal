riot police and para-military forces on Sunday patrolled streets and guarded key installations as an opposition-led strike virtually halted life across Bangladesh , witnesses said . 
the strike , called by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) of former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia , shut businesses and kept transport off the roads . 
strike enforcers , many carrying sticks and wearing headbands , marched on the streets of Dhaka , and set off dozens of home-made bombs and firecrackers , witnesses said . 
former home ( interior ) minister Abdul Matin Chowdhury , leading a group of pickets , was hit by a stone while passing by offices of the ruling Awami League and was taken to hospital bleeding from the head , witnesses said . 
officials in Chittagong reported sporadic bomb blasts and noisy demonstrations during what they called a crippling strike in the port city . 
other main cities including Khulna and Rajshahi were also in the grip of the strike , local reporters said . 
rail and air traffic operated but with fewer passengers , transport officials said . 
in Dhaka , hundred of government employees either walked to their offices or took pedal rickshaws , which operated in defiance of the strike . 
many senior officials stayed in their offices overnight . 
the BNP called the eight-hour strike for Sunday , a working day in mainly Moslem Bangladesh , in its first major attempt to destabilise the eight-month-old government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina . 
Hasina took office last June after defeating the BNP in a general election in which both the BNP and Hasina &apos;s Awami League accused each other of vote-rigging , but which was billed as free and fair by local and international monitors . 
the BNP says the strike is intended as a protest against what it views as the government &apos;s failure to provide for the basic needs of citizens in this poor nation and against Hasina &apos;s warmer ties with rival India , which the BNP sees as a plot to surrender Bangladeshi sovereignty .
