Ukraine plans to issue foreign currency denominated bonds on foreign markets next year , central bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko said on Tuesday . 
&quot; At this time we have two projects ready outlining the release of bonds on the foreign market , &quot; Yushchenko told Reuters . 
the Ukrainian government and central bank estimate they will need to raise $ 250 million on the foreign market towards Ukraine &apos;s budget deficit , he said . 
&quot; At the beginning we will issue a small volume of three-month bonds in order to determine a rate for them . 
once we establish that rate , we &apos;ll hold a second issue of one-year bonds at a higher price , &quot; said Yushchenko . 
details about times and volumes would be released once the government passes its 1997 budget , he said . 
Yushchenko did not say which currency the bonds would be issue in . 
under its constitution Ukraine is required to present a final budget to parliament by September 15 , but President Leonid Kuchma has said it would probably be delayed this year because of problems with the deficit . 
Ukraine has in previous years passed its budgets several months late .
