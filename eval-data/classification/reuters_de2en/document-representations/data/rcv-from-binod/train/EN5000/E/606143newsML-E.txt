below are percent changes for April for the experimental using geometric and Laspeyres CPIs , and the official current CPI issued last week . 
all Items 0.1 0.2 0.1 
-Less Food / Energy 0.3 0.2 0.3 
the geometric formula differs from the official current method because it takes into account consumers &apos; tendency to substitute among similar items . 
the Laspeyres formula uses the same mathematical base as the current CPI but adds a technical adjustment to make it comparable to the geometric mean index .
