the Bank of Spain is expected to cut its 5.75 percent key money market rate by at least 25 basis points at its regular repurchase auction on Tuesday , analysts predicted . 
in a Reuter poll of 11 analysts and dealers conducted on Monday --after the March Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) at the lower end of the forecasts on Friday-- only one ruled out a Tuesday rate movement . 
all others agreed the central bank would make good use of the recent downtrend in inflation and the peseta &apos;s relative strength . 
one economist expected a 50 basis points cut . 
March CPI rose a monthly 0.1 percent , up 2.2 percent on the year , down from 2.5 percent in February and 2.9 percent in January . 
analysts said different factors were in favour of this year &apos;s third rate cut -- inflation , the deal to reform the labour market , and the peseta . 
in the meantime the only argument against seemed to be the possibility that the central bank might decide to wait for more data . 
the Bank of Spain last cut rates by 25 basis points on March 14 .
