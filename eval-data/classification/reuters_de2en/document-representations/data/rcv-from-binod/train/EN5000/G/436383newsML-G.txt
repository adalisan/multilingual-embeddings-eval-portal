Indonesia &apos;s parliament ratified on Wednesday a treaty banning nuclear weapons from Southeast Asia , making it the seventh country in the region to do so . 
the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapons Free Zone was ratified during a plenary session attended by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas . 
&quot; Nuclear weapons are cruel mass annihilators , &quot; Alatas said during the session . 
Southeast Asia officially became a nuclear weapons-free zone in 1995 when leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) signed the treaty banning the possession , manufacture and purchase of nuclear arms . 
the treaty , which was subject to ratification by the parliaments of regional nations , bans the testing or use of nuclear weapons and the dumping of nuclear waste in waters around ASEAN countries . 
it also sets out guidelines for monitoring nuclear power safety . 
ASEAN groups Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam . 
Cambodia , Laos and Burma are expected to join , possibly as early as this year . 
Indonesia follows Brunei , Cambodia , Laos , Malaysia , Burma and Vietnam in ratifying the treaty .
