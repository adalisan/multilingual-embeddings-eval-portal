gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) surprised no one and merely focused the picture of a strong first-quarter U.S. economy , economists said . 
the government said U.S. GDP grew 5.8 percent in the first quarter , slightly more than the 5.6 percent first reported . 
&quot; Based on the GDP revision , nobody should change any impressions of the economy that they formulated when the data were originally reported , &quot; said Elliott Platt , managing director in charge of economic research . 
&quot; inventories were revised upward by a little less than had been expected . 
there was a marginal , marginal downward revision to final sales . 
consumption was a little weaker than first reported but that was fairly apparent from the retail sales revisions we had gotten earlier . 
two inflation measures saw small adjustments . 
the price index was revised up slightly to a 2.8 percent increase from the 2.7 percent rise first reported . 
and the implicit price deflator was revised down a bit to up 2.2 percent instead of the 2.3 percent rise first reported .
