Nigeria said on Monday it was no longer interested in rescheduling its debt to the Paris Club of government creditors and would pursue its economic programme to earn debt relief from the group . 
finance minister Anthony Ani , explaining the country &apos;s 1997 fiscal budget to journalists , said the cost of debt rescheduling was too high . 
&quot; Our original Paris Club debt was $ 17.66 billion without interest . 
we have paid $ 6.749 billion , and we are still owing $ 19 billion . 
and so , we will not go for debt rescheduling again because it is only postponement of the debt , &quot; he said . 
according to the budget announced on Saturday by military ruler General Sani Abacha , Nigeria &apos;s stock of foreign debt has fallen to $ 28 billion from more than $ 32 billion a year ago . 
Ani said this included arrears due from lack of Nigeria &apos;s servicing of its Paris Club debt . 
&quot; What we did was to visit every country that we owe and reconcile the accounts , and now we know our debt up to the last dollar , &quot; he said , adding &quot; We have never done this kind of work before . 
Nigeria would continue to vigorously implement its own economic programme for the next two to three years , believing that this would qualify the country for debt relief .
