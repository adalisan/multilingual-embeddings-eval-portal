the Swiss franc failed to rally as a safe haven currency outside EMU after France &apos;s Left swept to victory in Sunday &apos;s elections , in constrast to forecasts of some Euro-pundits who had expected it to firm . 
the trick now will be to see if the Swiss franc can continue to avoid rising sharply during what could be a turbulent run-up to a single European currency . 
the Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) has vowed it will fight any Swiss franc gain which it believes would damage the country &apos;s tentative economic recovery . 
&quot; The way things are looking right at this minute , it seems the urgency has been reduced . 
it is not clear that it means the game is over , &quot; said Adam Beaudin , market strategist at CSFB . 
the Swiss franc &apos;s status outside the planned single currency to be launched in January 1999 has given it counterweight status to currencies expected to join the euro . 
but although the Swiss franc was sharply weaker against the dollar on Monday , it was steady or even a shade weaker against the mark , the linchpin of the planned single European currency . 
the mark rose above 83 Swiss centimes at midday , well above the seven-month low of 82.35 set on May 21 just before the SNB announced it would aggressively add liquidity to the domestic market to prevent any unjustified franc gains . 
traders who forecast a swift mark drop to 81.00 centimes in the event of a French leftist victory were still waiting . 
&quot; The Swiss franc actually has been fairly stable . 
I think already on Friday markets were pricing in a Socialist victory , &quot; said Paul Lambert , senior currency analyst at UBS in London . 
&quot; Basically this hasn &apos;t been the earthquake people were expecting , &quot; he added . 
the key may be the Swiss National Bank , once again , with markets wondering if it can continue to keep investors on its side in its battle against a stronger Swiss franc . 
Lambert said one factor working against a Swiss franc rise may be the belief that although the French election outcome could lead to a softer Euro , it might actually force interest rates higher in some countries , especially those with currencies perceived as softish such as the lira . 
meanwhile , he said , &quot; the next focus of the market is on the money market operations of the Swiss National Bank , and what is expected to be its continued accommodation , &quot; he said . 
&quot; They are expected to be generous in the market , &quot; he added . 
the SNB on Monday continued to offer money to banks via its routine operations at a low 1.00 percent . 
this compared with 1-5 / 8 percent on comparable operations early in May . 
but at the same time , Swiss banks were not keen to take the liquidity the SNB was offering because tomorrow / next money which Swiss banks trade among themselves was much cheaper . 
tomorrow / next rates have drifted down to 0.5 percent to 5 / 8 percent since the SNB began aggressively lowering the rates on its own operations . 
the SNB &apos;s latest 10-day bank statement showed in fact that the amount of liquidity which Swiss banks held at the SNB in the form of sight deposits actually contracted during the period in which the SNB was being expansive . 
an SNB spokesman said the decline in sight deposits in the latest week was not a sign of a more restrictive SNB policy but rather reflected low demand for liquidity . 
&quot; In the market there is a lot of money , it was enough for the banks . 
the bank demand was not very high . 
but we are still very committed to keeping the market liquid , &quot; he said .
