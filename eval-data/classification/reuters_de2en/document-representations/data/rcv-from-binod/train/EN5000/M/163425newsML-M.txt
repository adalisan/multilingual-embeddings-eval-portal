rising dollar demand amid falling supply pushed the Bulgarian Lev down to 248.50-249.50 per dollar at the close from 246-247 in the morning with the central bank slowing down the fall , dealers said . 
&quot; ( Dollar ) supply was too low to meet rising demand and the Lev lost some five levs against the dollar from Friday despite support from the central bank , &quot; a commercial bank dealer said . 
the Lev closed around 244-245 per dollar on the interbank market on Friday . 
rumours spread in the morning that the government might fail to convince the International Monetary Fund to release a delayed second tranche of funding , dealers said . 
&quot; This made traders very nervous and they rushed to buy every dollar offered because of expectations of a further Lev fall , &quot; another dealer said . 
the central bank was seen selling dollars between 244-249 levs throughout the day , partly relieving pressure on the national currency , dealers said . 
Central bank officials were not immediately available for comment . 
an IMF mission is in Sofia to review the government &apos;s reform performance under a funding agreement sealed in July . 
the IMF has twice postponed a $ 115 million tranche of funding since September due to the slow pace of market reform .
