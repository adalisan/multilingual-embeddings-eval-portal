the German government urged Israelis and Palestinians on Friday to avoid any course of action that might jeopardise the peace process in the Middle East . 
Israel announced this week the expansion of Jewish West Bank settlements surrounding Jerusalem and the demolition of an Arab community centre in East Jerusalem . 
city officials there said the centre was being erected illegally . 
but Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said the moves by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s government were tantamount to war . 
tension has been rising in the region since . 
&quot; We believe that the Israeli settlement policy in the occupied areas is an obstacle to the establishment of peace , &quot; Martin Erdmann , a spokesman for Bonn &apos;s Foreign Ministry told journalists . 
&quot; All concerned must avoid taking any course of action that could pose an obstacle to the peace process and which could make a peaceful solution difficult , &quot; he said , as news came of a renewed breakdown in Arab-Israeli peace talks in Jerusalem . 
Erdmann said that Bonn supported European Union efforts to persuade Israel to stop further Jewish settlement on the West Bank . 
Germany &apos;s Defence Minister Volker Ruehe will pay a state visit to Israel from September 2 to 4 aimed at deepening friendly relations with Germany , the defence ministry said in a statement . 
Ruehe had visited once before in 1993 . 
Ruehe plans to meet his Israeli counterpart Yitzhak Mordechai and Israeli President Ezer Weizman . 
he was also expected to meet Prime Minister Netanyahu and opposition leader Shimon Peres for talks . 
the main issues on the agenda were the peace process and security in the Mediterranean region . 
Ruehe also planned to visit Israeli airforce troops in the Negev desert , as well as an Israeli naval base in the Eilat bay .
