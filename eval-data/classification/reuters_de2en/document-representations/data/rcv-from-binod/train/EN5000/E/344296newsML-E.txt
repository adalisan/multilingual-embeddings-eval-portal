money paid into an escrow account holding proceeds from the sale of Iraqi oil would total $ 239 million by the end of the day , when a deposit of $ 23.4 million was expected , a U.N. spokesman said on Thursday . 
the account , at the New York branch of the Banque Nationale de Paris , was opened under an oil-for-food deal that became effective on Dec . 10 . 
it enables Iraq to sell $ 2 billion of oil over six months to buy food , medicine and other humanitarian supplies to help offset the effects of sanctions imposed since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait . 
the U.N. spokesman , Juan Carlos Brandt , said $ 24 million was paid into the escrow account on Jan . 27 and $ 21 million on Jan . 28 . 
thirty percent of the proceeds from the oil sales are earmarked for a U.N. compensation commission , which deals with reparations for victims of the Iraqi invasion . 
he said $ 81 million from the oil sales had been disbursed from the account so far , including $ 52 million for the compensation commission . 
the rest went for other costs relating to the Gulf war . 
on Wednesday five more contracts worth a total of some $ 22 million were submitted to the Security Council &apos;s Iraqi sanctions committee for the purchase by Iraq of various items funded by the &quot; oil-for-food &quot; deal , Brandt said . 
these contracts were for the sale by Jordan of toilet cleaner , detergent powder and tea . 
the tea sale will be approved automatically under a so-called &quot; no objection &quot; procedure if no member of the 15-nation committee raises any objections by a 5 p.m. est ( 2200 GMT ) Friday deadline . 
the non-food contracts are subject to a seven-day &quot; no objection &quot; deadline . 
Brandt said a contract submitted last week for the sale by Vietnam of detergent powder believed to be worth $ 5 million had been put on hold . 
he gave no reason .
