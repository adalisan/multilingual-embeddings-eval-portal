Yemen reported a high voter turnout in the country &apos;s first parliamentary elections since a 1994 civil war , but two fatal shootings in which nine people died overshadowed Sunday &apos;s polling . 
witnesses said Sanaa appeared calm on Monday as military police armed with AK-47 assault rifles manned polling stations while votes were counted . 
the Minister of Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Abdullah Ahmad Ghanem said first results were expected on Monday afternoon , but election observers said vote counting was extremely slow . 
a spokesman for the Supreme Election Committee announced an 80 percent voter turnout , but international monitors believed it was closer to 60 percent . 
before voting began , a soldier started shooting at people randomly at a polling station in the town of Mukayras , killing five soldiers and three civilians , Interior Minister Hussein Mohammad Arab said . 
Arab said security officials were investigating the incident but no political motive had been established . 
&quot; We were expecting more incidents because some are discontented with holding general elections in Yemen , &quot; he said . 
he did not elaborate . 
he said one of the victims of the first attack was a member of Yemen &apos;s ruling party , the General Peoples Congress ( GPC ) . 
also on Sunday , a man who was refused access to a polling station in Dhamar , 100 km ( 60 miles ) south of Sanaa , fired on a security officer who died after the attack , an election observer said . 
the incidents raised to four the number of election-related fatal attacks . 
a man was killed when clashes broke out between supporters of the GPC and its junior coalition partner , the Islamist Islah Party , in Ibb on April 20 and a child was killed in Taiz on Thursday when gunmen opened fire on a GPC rally . 
election observers said the violence was not surprising as many Yemenis routinely carry AK-47s and other weapons . 
&quot; There is a lot of ongoing tribal violence that has nothing to do with the elections , &quot; an election monitor said . 
&quot; A lot of people carry arms , whether they are wearing grenade belts or they have Kalashnikovs . 
another observer said family clashes in the Dhamar and Marib area left two people dead on Sunday . 
violence erupted after members of feuding families had voted , but it was apparently unrelated to the election , the observer said . 
one election observer said the voting and counting process seemed free of violations in several polling stations visited . 
Western diplomats expect President Ali Abdullah Saleh &apos;s GPC and its Islamist junior coalition partner , the Islah Party , to retain power . 
the main opposition Yemen Socialist Party , some of whose former leaders launched the separatist campaign that sparked civil war , and three others boycotted the polls due to alleged irregularities . 
the government denied the charges . 
diplomats say they were encouraged by Yemen &apos;s democratic experiment , but add that power ultimately rests with the president , his appointed ministers , and military and security forces loyal to the GPC . 
a total of 2,306 candidates , including 17 women , stood for the 301 parliamentary seats , either under the banner of 12 parties or as independents . 
diplomats said the government hoped to boost its democratic image and provide the political stability needed to attract foreign investment and aid to the impoverished Arab state , a small oil producer .
