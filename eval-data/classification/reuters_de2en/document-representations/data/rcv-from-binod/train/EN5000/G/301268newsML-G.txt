a rockslide killed three people and another 20 were injured when part of southern Italy &apos;s Sorrento coast collapsed into the sea after heavy rain , rescue workers said on Saturday . 
two houses in the village of Pozzano on the panoramic peninsula were hit and about 10 cars were wrecked , two of them swept into the sea , when 10,000 cubic metres of rock and mud roared down onto the coastal road , the fire service said . 
&quot; We are continuing to search but we have no reports at the moment that anyone is missing , &quot; a fire service spokesman said . 
initial reports of Friday night &apos;s slide , which followed two days of incessant rain , had put the death toll at five . 
part of the coastal road to Sorrento , a magnet for foreign holidaymakers , remained cut off on Saturday as 200 firemen and scores of other rescue workers continued the clear-up . 
divers scoured the waters off the peninsula , at the southern end of the Bay of Naples , but found no bodies , the spokesman said . 
southern Italy has been lashed by torrential rain in the past week , causing landslides in the several areas . 
witnesses said part of the mountain along the Sorrento road just fell away . 
&quot; I heard an enormous roar and the next thing I saw was a huge chunk of the coast collapse , &quot; police officer Guglielmo Pignataro said .
