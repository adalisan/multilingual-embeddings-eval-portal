Japan goes to the polls in general elections on October 20 , the first test of a new single-seat electoral system , lacking clear issues needed to cure widespread voter apathy . 
ahead of official campaigning starting Tuesday , Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto &apos;s Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) is in a commanding position to continue its rule , whether along or with smaller partners in a coalition , recent surveys said . 
the only new force to appear is the Democratic Party , a liberal group led by Yukio Hatoyama , scion of a family which bred three generations of politicians , and Naoto Kan , a former peace activist and popular Health Minister who spearheaded a probe of a 10-year-old AIDS scandal . 
Japan will also test a new electoral system for the Lower House , the decisive chamber in parliament , by combining 300 members chosen in single-seat districts and 200 members elected by proportional representation in 11 regional blocs . 
the new house will have 500 seats , down from 512 at present . 
the new system replaces 130 multi-member constituencies , blamed as a root cause of corruption because candidates were forced to spend lavishly in their campaigns . 
in the outgoing Lower House , the LDP held 207 seats and ruled through a coalition with the Socialists and the small Sakigake party . 
the main opposition Shinshinto ( New Frontier Party ) had 162 seats and the Communists 15 . 
Hatoyama formed his Democratic Party last month from members of the two smaller parties in the coalition , and had 50 seats in the outgoing house . 
the Social Democrats led by Takako Doi , the outgoing Lower House speaker , holds 30 seats and Sakigake nine . 
the blur in Japan &apos;s general elections is intentional . 
Hashimoto chose the lack of a central issue to call elections early , which he need not have done until July 1997 . 
he has also not stated what kind of government he would lead after the results , saying his only goal was a simple majority in the house . 
that appears unlikely . 
recent surveys give the LDP some 30 percent support against eight percent for Shinshinto and about the same for Hatoyama &apos;s Democrats . 
Hashimoto &apos;s lieutenants are already trying to lure Hatoyama &apos;s Democrats into a renewed coalition . 
&quot; Even if we were able to win a simple majority , we would need a comfortable majority of some 280 seats to push through our policies , &quot; said Taku Yamazaki , the LDP &apos;s policy chief in a television talk show on Sunday . 
&quot; We can agree with many of the policies of the Democratic Party . 
the biggest bloc of voters , some 35 percent , are yet uncommitted , and most media polls say three years of revolving-door governments , rampant defections and confusing mergers have left voters more apathetic than ever to politics . 
Hashimoto has the good fortune to be at the helm of the LDP now , in contrast to the last July 1993 polls when LDP funding scandals had become the main election issue . 
the LDP was toppled from power then , the first time it was relegated to an opposition role since it was founded in 1955 . 
a year later , however , the LDP made a surprise comeback by successfully forming an unwieldy left-right coalition with its long-time Cold War rival , the Socialists , and the small Sakigake . 
in the end , many members from the two smaller parties left for the new Democratic Party . 
this time , there are no huge scandals haunting the LDP and the main opposition Shinshinto is losing steam .
