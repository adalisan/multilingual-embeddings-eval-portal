the European Parliament condemned European Commission President Jacques Santer and Britain on Wednesday for serious errors in the way they handled the mad cow crisis but stopped short of immediate sanctions . 
it adopted a scathing report by a special committee of inquiry that accused the Commission and Britain of giving the beef market priority over public health , failing to enforce eradication measures and minimising the risks of the disease , bovine spongiform encepohalopathy ( BSE ) . 
the parliament voted by 422 to 49 , with 48 abstentions , in favour of a joint resolution on the report , tabled by the parliament &apos;s three main political groups - the Socialists , Christian Democrats and Liberals . 
the resolution condemned &quot; the behaviour of the UK government and its management of the BSE crisis and deplores the refusal of its Minister of Agriculture to attend and give evidence to the committee . 
it also called on the Commission to take &quot; urgent and effective &quot; action to implement the report &apos;s recommendations but did not set a deadline . 
the parliament rejected all but one of 12 amendments to the resolution , including a demand that the Commission take legal action against the British government .
