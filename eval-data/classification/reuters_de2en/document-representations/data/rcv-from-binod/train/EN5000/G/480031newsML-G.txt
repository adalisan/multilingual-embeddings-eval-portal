leading Republican senators said Monday that proposed legislation would reduce the threat of chemical weapons regardless of whether the Senate approves an international treaty outlawing such weapons . 
the legislation , seen as an alternative to the Chemical Weapons Convention , sets penalties within the United States for possession of chemical and biological weapons and requires U.S. sanctions against against other countries using such weapons . 
a statement by six senators , including Foreign Relations Chairman Jesse Helms , said &quot; the legislation takes practical steps toward achieving the goal of ending the chemical weapons threat , irrespective of whether or not a resolution of ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention might be crafted to make that treaty more effective . 
Helms opposes the treaty , but indicated last week that he would be willing to allow a Senate vote on the pact . 
&quot; There &apos;d be no problem with it ( the treaty ) if we can continue to negotiate as we have been for the last few days , &quot; Helms said during an appearance with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Wingate , North Carolina , Helms &apos;s home state . 
the administration made a concession related to the chemical treaty last week when it agreed to seek the Senate &apos;s two-thirds majority approval of amendments to other arms control treaties . 
Helms had linked such action to progress on the chemical weapons treaty . 
in their statement on the Republican legislation , Helms and five other senators said : &quot; This bill is the best thing we can do to protect our country and the world from the horrors of chemical and biological weapons .
