China &apos;s epic movie of the 19th century opium War when Britain seized Hong Kong was branded an &quot; opium bore &quot; on Thursday by a leading film critic here . 
&quot; The result seems more like a loud cannon blast that disappears into a cloud of smoke , &quot; Dennis Eng wrote in the Hong Kong Standard , a Chinese-owned English-language daily . 
Eng also said &quot; The opium War &quot; , a US $ 12 million blockbuster with a cast of 50,000 including 3,000 non-Chinese , was a &quot; one-sided drama &quot; and &quot; bogged down by too many subplots &quot; . 
this was the first review to appear in Hong Kong media and a spokeswoman for distributors Panasia Films said : &quot; This is only one critic and the movie has not opened to the public yet so this is not a general verdict . 
the film , which depicts Britain seizing Hong Kong from the Qing Dynasty &apos;s empire after winning a war over opium trade , will be released on Friday ahead of Hong Kong &apos;s return to China at midnight on June 30 . 
Panasia launched the local premiere with twin screenings at the Hong Kong Convention Centre on Wednesday . 
it was first shown in Beijing . 
Governor Chris Patten was not invited to the VIP events where his successor , future leader Tung Chee-hwa , the president of the incoming legislature Rita Fan and the deputy director of China &apos;s Hong Kong mission , Zhang Junsheng , mingled with some 1,000 guests .
