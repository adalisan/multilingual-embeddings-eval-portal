German Graciano Rocchigiani tested positive for a banned drug when he lost to compatriot Dariusz Michalczewski in a controversial World Boxing Organisation ( WBO ) light-heavyweight championship bout last August , German anti-doping sources said on Tuesday . 
traces of the banned stimulant ephedrine were found in Rocchigiani &apos;s urine after the fight in Hamburg , they said . 
the anti-doping sources said Cologne drug-testing laboratory chief Wilhelm Schaenzer would confirm the result at a news conference starting at 1000 GMT . 
Rocchigiani was angry with the verdict of the controversial fight on August 10 and lodged an appeal after the bout ended in chaos . 
Rocchiagiani , clearly ahead on points , landed a hard left hook which floored his opponent in the seventh round , but the blow came after the referee had ordered the pair to break . 
Rocchigiani said he did not hear the instruction . 
after 15 minutes of consultations , WBO officials declared Michalczewski the winner , to jeers and whistles from the crowd .
