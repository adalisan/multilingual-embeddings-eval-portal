the Serbian opposition &apos;s witty and inventive street protests have sounded a wakeup call to Yugoslavia &apos;s aloof and immovable socialist establishment . 
and where else might riot police still be seen smiling after 53 consecutive days on duty ? 
the opposition antics , ranging from car cavalcades to pot-banging concerts , yielded their first fruit this week when the Socialist Party of Serbia ( SPS ) conceded partial defeat on Wednesday in disputed local elections . 
the authoritarian party led by President Slobodan Milosevic admitted they had been beaten by the opposition Zajedno ( Together ) coalition in Serbia &apos;s second largest city , Nis . 
that was where the protest movement erupted in outrage at the SPS &apos;s annulment of Zajedno &apos;s upset election victories on November 17 in 15 of the 18 biggest cities , including the capital Belgrade . 
since then , a motley alliance of democrats , monarchists , nationalists , irreverent students , disgruntled jobless and neighbourhood mavericks have rattled the establishment with their ingenuity , strict non-violence and , not least , endurance . 
they have also charmed Western governments pressing for democratisation in Yugoslavia . 
some protest leader have been invited to attend the inauguration ceremony of U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on January 20 . 
the mood at demonstrations has usually swung between restrained tension -- insults hurled at unyielding police cordons -- and comic street theatre with protesters kissing policemen and playing cat-and-mouse to outwit a ban on marches . 
police have only intermittently enforced the edict and some officers have been unable to suppress grins at the protesters &apos; play-acting , even while chasing them through the street . 
demonstrators &apos; main weapons are whistles , pots , pans and drums , using them to create an echoing din . 
alarm clocks were added on New Year &apos;s Eve , ringing at the stroke of midnight . 
some police whistled back at attractive women in the crowds . 
a few thousand protesters in the provincial town of Sabac set a record with 32 minutes of uninterrupted whistling after Milosevic was mentioned in a speech , local media reported . 
last Sunday , Zajedno drove thousands of balloon-draped , honking cars into central Belgrade at a snail &apos;s pace and stopped . 
cars were hoisted on Jacks and bonnets were raised . 
one grizzled old man examined his car with a stethoscope . 
&quot; For 20 years I had this feeling that I &apos;d break down today right in this spot , &quot; one driver said with a wink . 
car alarms wailed . 
protesters quipped that breakdowns were inevitable because the state was selling diluted petrol and the people were so impoverished by Socialist misrule that they could not afford to replace their ageing cars . 
on Wednesday , protesters &quot; stalled &quot; their cars across tram tracks . 
a game of tag ensued with cars springing back to life and speeding off as soon as police tow trucks appeared , only to return when the coast was clear . 
every evening at 7 : 30 , Belgraders pour into the streets or rush on to their apartment balconies to bang pots , pans and drums to drown out the news on RTS state television , which has ignored or vilified the democracy movement . 
protest placards have been funny too . 
&quot; Even the blondes have caught on , &quot; said one carried by two young blondes . 
others include : &quot; Alice in the Land of RTS &quot; , and &quot; archaeologists will dig you ( Socialists ) up . 
a Zajedno poster shows Milosevic emptying a box of ballots into his mouth in one frame , only to throw up in the next . 
on Thursday , students with red , white or blue cards tacked to their chests started a system of 24-hour rotating &quot; shifts &quot; to exhaust police cordons . 
the first attempt worked within an hour . 
police withdrew with weary smiles and waves . 
students reacted to previous police blockades by linking hands and dancing to Serbian folk music or walking in circles with hands on their heads , as if in prison . 
last month , some students sprayed the Serbian parliament building with pesticide after it postponed a session in the midst of the protest crisis to undergo fumigation .
