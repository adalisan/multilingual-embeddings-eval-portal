an East Timorese man has been jailed for one year for spreading hatred against Indonesian President Suharto after displaying a banner in the territory last year , the Antara news agency reported on Monday . 
the agency said the state court in the East Timor capital Dili on Monday sentenced Joao Do Rosario Pires Al Joao , 24 , under a lighter section of the criminal code because he told the court he did not know the poster was spreading hatred . 
the report said the more serious charge of intentionally spreading hatred against the president , which carries a maximum sentence of six years jail , was not proved . 
Antara said the banner showed a picture of Suharto beside jailed East Timorese resistance leader Xanana Gusmao . 
the report did not mention that the image of Suharto showed the president with a bloody bone in his mouth and holding two human skulls . 
the banner , captioned &quot; Suharto eats the bones of East Timorese &quot; , was placed outside the offices of Noble peace laureate Bishop Carlos Belo in a demonstration in support of the head of the Dili diocese while he was giving a news conference . 
Antara quoted Joao as saying he did not know the meaning of the banner , which was partly written in English . 
&quot; I did not know that if a picture of the President was put beside Xanana it was categorised as spreading hatred against the president , &quot; Joao was quoted by Antara as saying . 
a small band of armed rebels , which the Indonesian army says number less than 100 , and an urban-based clandestine movement still oppose Jakarta &apos;s rule in the territory which remains heavily garrisoned by Indonesian troops . 
Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony of East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year in an act not recognised by the United Nations .
