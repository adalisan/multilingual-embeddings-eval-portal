Hong Kong &apos;s future leader Tung Chee-hwa launched plans on Wednesday to curb political freedoms after China takes over the territory this year , incurring criticism from British colonial Governor Chris Patten . 
the planned changes , which would curtail demonstrations and foreign funding for political parties , had been expected after China &apos;s parliament resolved in late February that several Hong Kong laws protecting civil liberties and rights be amended . 
China &apos;s decision , based on the argument that existing laws breach Hong Kong &apos;s post-handover constitution , the Basic Law , takes effect on July 1 , when the British colony of 156 years reverts to China . 
the plans , outlined in a consultation paper , will also remove at a stroke democratic freedoms introduced by Patten , whom China considers an arch-foe . 
Patten said the proposals were not justified . 
&quot; If anybody , if any legal opinion could be produced to show that our existing laws contravene the Basic Law , then there might be an argument for change . 
but that has not been demonstrated and cannot be demonstrated , &quot; he told reporters . 
&quot; Now the question is this -- is this a genuine consultation process or is it not ? 
the document doesn &apos;t set out options . 
it puts forward one set of proposals and nowhere does it justify changing the present law , &quot; he said . 
he also rejected the argument made by top civil servant Michael Suen , who has been seconded to the office of future leader Tung to help craft the post-handover government , that the changes were needed because of the decision by China &apos;s parliament , the National People &apos;s Congress ( NPC ) . 
&quot; The NPC is an important body , but the NPC is not Moses , bringing the tablets down from the top of the mountain , &quot; he said . 
Hong Kong democrats also launched a scathing attack on the plans . 
&quot; It is tantamount to taking away the rights ... recognised by the constitution , that are recognised by international covenants , &quot; said Albert Ho , a Democratic Party member and legislator . 
under the plans , societies and political parties would have to be registered and might be refused registration if they are known to have ties to or receive donations from foreign political organisations or individuals , including those from Taiwan , which China regards as a renegade province . 
people wishing to hold demonstrations would need permission from police seven days in advance . 
demonstrations should only be staged after the police issue a notice of &quot; no objection &quot; . 
under the current system , the police need only be notified beforehand . 
the proposals aroused concern from political groups , including those with Taiwan links operating in the territory . 
the public was invited to give comments on the plans in a pulse-taking exercise over the next three weeks , Suen said . 
legislation drafted on the basis of the proposals will be enacted by a China-anointed provisional legislature which replaces the elected Legislative Council on July 1 . 
the provisional legislature intended to set up a sub-group to examine the proposals , local radio reported . 
Britain and some of its allies have attacked all the moves as a reversal of democratic freedoms in this territory of 6.4 million people . 
under the Sino-British agreements on the handover , Hong Kong has been guaranteed a high degree of autonomy for 50 years .
