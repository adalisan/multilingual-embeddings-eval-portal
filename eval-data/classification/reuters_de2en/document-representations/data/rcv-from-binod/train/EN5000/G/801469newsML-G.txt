backup point guard Howard Eisley , who improved his stock with his performance in the playoffs , was re-signed Thursday by the Utah Jazz . 
terms were not disclosed . 
Eisley averaged 4.5 points and 2.4 assists in 82 regular-season games while backing up All-Star John Stockton . 
he boosted his scoring average to 5.6 per game in the postseason and presented matchup problems with his quickness and ability to create his own shot as Utah went to the finals against the Chicago bulls . 
&quot; Everything here is suited to my game . 
the free-agent signing was the fourth of the off-season by the Jazz , who have kept intact the nucleus of a team that won 64 games last season . 
they already have re-signed forwards Bryon Russell , Shandon Anderson and Antoine Carr . 
starting guard Jeff Hornacek remains unsigned but is not expected to sign elsewhere . 
Eisley was thought to be expendable when the Jazz drafted guard Jacque Vaughn in the first round . 
he received offers from other teams where he might have been able to start but chose to stay with the Jazz . 
&quot; My agent mentioned other deals to me about other teams offering money and situations like that but , in my mind , I always wanted to come back here , &quot; Eisley said . 
&quot; John Stockton has been around here and he understands the game and there &apos;s no better person to learn from than John . 
a high school teammate of current NBA players Voshon Lenard and Jalen Rose , Eisley went on to play at Boston College . 
he was a 1994 second-round pick of the Minnesota Timberwolves and also played for the San Antonio spurs before the Jazz signed him in October 1995 .
