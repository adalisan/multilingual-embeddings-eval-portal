Romania will have negative growth in 1997 , Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea said on Thursday . 
&quot; Economic growth will be negative , &quot; Ciorbea told a news conference broadcast live , alongside representatives of the World Bank and European Union . 
&quot; The exact figure will be disclosed at subsequent news conferences . 
experts from the IMF and World Bank are holding talks with Romania &apos;s new centrist government on a package of reforms that will enable them to resume credits suspended last year to the Balkan country . 
Romania experienced 6.9 percent growth in 1995 , one of the highest rates among ex-communist states in eastern Europe . 
but most economists described the growth as unsound . 
final figures for last year are still unavailable , but a forecast by the leftist government thrown out of office in last November &apos;s elections put it at 4.8 percent .
