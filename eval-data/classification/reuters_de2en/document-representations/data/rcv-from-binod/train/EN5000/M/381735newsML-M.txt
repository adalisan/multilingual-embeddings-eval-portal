the dollar climbed above 1.70 marks for the first time since April 1994 at the European close on Monday , continuing its relentless rise on the back of solid economic fundamentals , dealers said . 
the dollar was bid up to a fresh 34-month high against the mark but failed to make much headway above 1.70 marks due to lack of follow-through buying as U.S. markets were closed for a holiday . 
but 1.70 marks is not the limit yet , analysts said . 
&quot; The outlook for the dollar is still positive , in view of continued economic problems in Germany and Japan , &quot; said Gerard Lyons , chief economist at DKB International . 
at 1615 GMT the dollar traded at 1.7004 marks , up from 1.6880 at the European close on Friday . 
against the yen , it was at 124.40 , up from 124.23 . 
the Dollar was also buoyant against the Swiss franc , trading at a fresh three-year high at 1.4820 francs , up from 1.4640 late on Friday . 
against the yen , the dollar was also invigorated but concern that central banks might intervene to stem its rise put a lid on further increases . 
Japan is generally believed to be the least happy of the G3 with persistent dollar strength , meaning the market has focused on the Bank of Japan for possible central bank action . 
but the Bundesbank last week joined the protest against further dollar gains , and its vice-president Johann-Wilhelm Gaddum told Reuters today he saw no reason for a weaker mark . 
but with players convinced that fundamentals favour a strong dollar , unilateral -- or even concerted -- intervention is unlikely to cool their ardour , traders and analysts said . 
the rally has been fired by relatively higher U.S. rates , the prospect of solid growth and dollar-positive capital flows . 
&quot; If the market feels it &apos;s only odd people within G7 who want this to stop , or they feel they &apos;re only going to have a tickle with it , I think the market will take the dollar higher , &quot; said Graham cocks , vice-president , treasury at Bank of Boston here . 
it requires a fundamental reassessment of econonomic prospects for the dollar &apos;s bullish trend to finish , analysts said .
