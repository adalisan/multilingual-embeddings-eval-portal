CSCE cocoa futures ended higher in thin dealings on Tuesday , bolstered by light speculative interest and industry-linked buying , market sources said . 
after pulling back for two sessions in a row , traders said the market was due for a technical correction . 
prices headed higher at the opening and stayed in positive territory for the remainder of the session . 
traders said a downturn in the U.S. dollar against the British pound also buoyed CSCE cocoa , as arbitrage favored cheaper prices on the dollar-denominated New York market . 
&quot; Industry was taking adavantage of the break in prices , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; And the weaker dollar helped New York a little . 
may futures rose $ 17 a tonne on the day , to $ 1,445 , having traded from $ 1,451 to $ 1,430 . 
may gained $ 11 , to $ 1,471 , while the remaining months were up $ 9 to $ 12 . 
traders said upward momentum picked up after the key May contract broke through near-term chart resistance at $ 1,440 a tonne and triggered buy-stops . 
but scattered scale-up selling by the trade trimmed gains and kept May below its next level of resistance at $ 1,453 , they added . 
technically , traders said a breach of $ 1,453 basis May contract could lead to a test of $ 1,460- $ 1,463 . 
on the downside , near-term support was seen around today &apos;s low of $ 1,430 . 
fundamentally , traders said views were mixed . 
while some dealers said an anticipated global cocoa deficit in 1996 / 97 and strong consumption should provide support for prices , other dealers said arrival figures out of the Ivory Coast could point to a larger-than-expected harvest from the world &apos;s number one producer . 
&quot; Consumption has been excellent , &quot; said Rich Wistisen , an analysts with commodity Information in Orem , Utah . 
&quot; But Ivorian arrivals are already up near one million tonnes and the mid-crop is developing well . 
Wistisen said the 1996 / 97 Ivorian harvest is likely to be close to last season &apos;s record yield of 1.2 million tonnes . 
many analysts have forecast a 1996 / 97 Ivory Coast crop of over one million tonnes , but the Ivorian commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze said earlier this month the total harvest was likely to be less than one million tonnes . 
the day &apos;s volume reached an estimated 5,108 lots , down from Monday &apos;s official tally of 7,600 lots .
