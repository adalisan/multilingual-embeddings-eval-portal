Canadian spot natural gas prices continued to erode Thursday , ladened by rising temperatures and plentiful gas storage supplies , sources said . 
at the AECO storage hub , swing prices fell another 15 cents to the C $ 1.60-1.62 per gigajoule ( GJ ) range , as temperatures in Calgary were expected to climb to about four degrees Celsius by the weekend . 
at Sumas , wash . , prices dropped into the $ 1.65-1.70 per million British thermal units ( mmBtu ) range , down more than 20 cents from Wednesday . 
Northwest Pipeline reported earlier that land movement was the main factor contributing to this weekend &apos;s ruptures on the two sections of its 26-inch gas pipeline in western Washington . 
as a precautionary measure , Northwest said it has stopped the flow of natural gas in the 26-inch mainline from Sumas to Washougal , wash . , thus taking the pipeline out of service for approximately 260 miles . 
the parallel 30-inch pipeline will remain in service , the company said . 
at Niagara , where temperatures are also forecast to turn milder , prices fell another 15 cents to the high- $ 2.40s to low- $ 2.50s per mmBtu . 
ample storage supply is another factor contributing to the softening eastern Canadian market , sources said .
