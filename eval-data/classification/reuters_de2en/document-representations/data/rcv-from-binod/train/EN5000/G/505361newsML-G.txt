Iran says it will recall its ambassadors from European Union states that have summoned their Tehran envoys home after a German court &apos;s verdict that the Islamic republic ordered political killings in Berlin . 
the Iranian parliament held a closed session to review the court verdict , and a second protest march on the German embassy in Tehran was planned for Sunday , two days after hundreds of protesters pelted the building with tomatoes . 
the official Iranian news agency IRNA late on Saturday quoted a Foreign Ministry source as saying Iran &quot; would reciprocate the decision of the ( EU ) governments to recall their ambassadors from Tehran &quot; . 
EU members , with the exception of Greece , summoned their envoys for consultations following Thursday &apos;s Berlin court ruling that Iranian leaders ordered the 1992 killings of four Kurdish dissidents in Germany . 
Iran , which has repeatedly denied all involvement in the killings , has urged EU states not to jeopardise their interests in Iran over the verdict . 
the court decision forced the EU to abandon its &quot; critical dialogue &quot; with Iran in a move which delighted the United States and other opponents of Tehran &apos;s Islamic government . 
the Iranian plan to recall its EU envoys comes amid growing tensions between Iran and Germany , until recently Tehran &apos;s biggest trade partner and closest Western friend . 
Bonn has been a staunch advocate of critical dialogue with Iran , a policy which means maintaining good relations and trade ties while also engaging in dialogue over human rights . 
a large number of Iranians plan to march from Tehran university &apos;s mosque to the German embassy in Tehran on Sunday to demonstrate against the ruling , according to Tehran radio . 
IRNA said parliament held a closed session early on Sunday to review the verdict . 
further meetings are planned . 
Iran &apos;s English-language daily Iran News said on Sunday &quot; the diplomatic crisis between the European Union and Iran has begun , &quot; but urged EU states not to join an American economic and political campaign to isolate Iran . 
&quot; The EU countries will not let the U.S. fuel the fire of the present crisis . 
say again a big NO to the same U.S. that called on the EU to join its policy in isolating Iran by limiting trade with Tehran , &quot; it said . 
Washington accuses Tehran of sponsoring international terrorism , a charge which Iran has repeatedly denied . 
the court ruling said the assassinations were ordered by a secret special operations committee whose members included Iran &apos;s president , its religious leader , intelligence minister and the head of foreign policy . 
but it stopped short of explicitly naming Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , whom prosecutors had accused of ultimate responsibility for the attack in Berlin &apos;s Mykonos restaurant . 
Germany has ordered four Iranian diplomats to leave the country and recalled its ambassador in Tehran immediately after the court verdict . 
Iran also recalled its ambassador and expelled four German diplomats . 
Rafsanjani on Friday criticised the verdict but said the diplomatic row was a &quot; passing storm &quot; provoked by the United States and Israel . 
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Saturday that Iran must show respect for international law before Bonn could discuss a fresh start in relations .
