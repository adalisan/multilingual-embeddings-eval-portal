a Gaston Taument hat-trick helped Feyenoord to a 5-0 victory over lowly RKC Waalwijk on Saturday in the Dutch league , their biggest home win of the season . 
but the Rotterdammers stayed second behind PSV Eindhoven who beat Fortuna Sittard 1-0 through a Wim Jonk penalty in a match which made Dutch soccer history . 
it was the first in which a player was shown the red card before he had set foot on the pitch . 
Fortuna midfielder Mark van Bommel was dismissed while he was warming up on the touchline for insulting a linesman in response to the penalty decision . 
PSV &apos;s victory means they lead the Dutch first division with 58 points from 25 matches with Feyenoord trailing by three points . 
the Eindhoven side , missing several key players due to injury and suspension , worked hard but failed to create clear chances until Jonk put them ahead from the spot in the 55th minute . 
in contrast , Feyenoord were unstoppable . 
Taument opened the scoring after eight minutes , scored his side &apos;s third in the 63rd and completed his hat-trick with the last goal in the 77th . 
defender Henk Fraser and Argentine Tati Montoya , who came to Feyenoord during the winter break , scored the other two goals . 
the defeat meant RKC dropped back to the bottom of the table with 19 points , one point less than NEC Nijmegen , who drew 0-0 against Groningen .
