SIMEX Euroyen futures reached new contract highs on Thursday as Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures were buoyed by overnight gains in U.S. treasuries . 
dealers said the Japanese interest rate market rose after the release of tame U.S. July retail sales data on Wednesday dampened speculation of an imminent U.S. rate hike . 
&quot; There &apos;s not enough evidence to show domestic inflation in the U.S. is heating up . 
the wage pressure is there but it &apos;s not that strong , &quot; said a bank dealer . 
U.S. treasuries were boosted by short-covering on data showing retail sales rose 0.6 percent in July , below economists &apos; forecast of a 0.7 percent increase . 
the U.S. July producer price index fell 0.1 percent , the seventh consecutive monthly decline . 
the bank dealer said Euroyen and JGB futures were also helped by an overnight International Monetary Fund report , which said Japan should keep a lid on interest rates to support its recovery for the time being . 
the report also said it would probably be desirable for Japan to begin tightening credit later in the year . 
volume was a low 6,420 lots . 
dealers said the contract would now face resistance around 99.29 / 30 . 
September JGBs ended at 126.97 after rising to 127.00 against a previous close at 126.51 . 
Eurodollar futures edged up on spillover buying from the overnight rise in U.S. treasuries .
