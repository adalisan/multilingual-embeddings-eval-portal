veteran goalkeeper Jim Leighton held back a relentless Swedish tide on Sunday to earn Scotland a splendid 1-0 victory in their World Cup campaign . 
time and again Leighton thwarted the Swedish attack with breathtaking saves to make sure that John McGinlay &apos;s early strike was just good enough to secure maximum points . 
the eighth-minute goal took Scotland a big step closer to the finals as they went top of group four ahead of Austria . 
but it needed luck , resolution and sheer brilliance from Leighton , making his 75th international appearance , to gain the triumph . 
Sweden now look in a precarious position to qualify as group winners . 
they occupy third place , a point behind the leading pair with one more game played . 
McGinlay &apos;s goal was was well-worked , with Darren Jackson cleverly dummying a long ball from Tom Boyd . 
McGinlay held off the presence of Joachim Bjorklund and drove a right-foot shot past Tomas Ravelli . 
Sweden were forced into an early switch when Kennet Andersson replaced the injured Martin Dahlin after only 17 minutes . 
Scotland captain Colin Hendry made a vital final tackle in the 34th minute when Andersson was played onside . 
Andersson &apos;s height gave Scotland problems and after one header slid narrowly past Leighton &apos;s left-hand post he missed an even better opportunity three minutes from the interval . 
Swedish skipper Jonas Thern wasted another chance seven minutes after the break with Scotland hardly able to break out of their defensive shell . 
Leighton made a vital stop after 64 minutes as Jesper Blomqvist seemed certain to finally turn Sweden &apos;s dominance into a goal . 
he made another brave save at the feet of Kennet Andersson and then grabbed a dangerous last minute free-kick to round off a magnificent match . 
Scotland boss Craig Brown said : &quot; It was great goalkeeping from Jim once again . 
he was awarded with a gold medal from the Scottish Football Association for winning 75 caps and we hope he can go on performing like that for years to come .
