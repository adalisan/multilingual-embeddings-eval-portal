Australian bonds outperformance against the U.S. appears to have stalled for now in the absence of any major data . 
however , many analysts expect the narrowing trend to resume once the local market sees what is expected to be favourable news , particularly quarterly inflation and wages data at the end of October . 
the Australian / U.S. 
10-year bond yield spread continued to creep wider having set a low of 104 basis points on Wednesday , its lowest level in over two years . 
new Zealand &apos;s 10-year premium over Australia held steady , but could come under widening pressure as the N.Z. 
election nears and possibly to the benefit of Australian debt . 
&quot; We are coming up to an election in two weeks time . 
for a few weeks there will be quiet a lot of uncertainty , &quot; said Rory Robertson , fixed interest analyst at BT Australia . 
&quot; We are actually looking for a bit of a pull-back , but we like the New Zealand fundamentals , so we see that pullback as an opportunity to buy , &quot; he added .
