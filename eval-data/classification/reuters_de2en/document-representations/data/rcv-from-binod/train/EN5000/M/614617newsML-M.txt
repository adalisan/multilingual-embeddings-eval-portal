Asian crude prices weakened marginally on Monday , in line with fall in futures prices on Friday . 
June Tapis swaps were offered at $ 21.35 per barrel , down 10 cents from Friday , but no trades were reported . 
on the physical market , activity was dominated by July Dubai trades done at the end of last week . 
a July Dubai was traded between European majors on Thursday , at full-month quotes + 42 cents per barrel . 
the seller was heard to be a shosha , but could not be confirmed . 
some traders considered the Dubai premiums a little on the high side , but thought that buyers were prompted to cover their July Dubai requirements early , due to fears that a repeat of the June Dubai market would occur . 
in June , a few traders were caught by a shortage in spot Dubai supplies as Indian demand was larger than expected . 
a July Oman cargo sold by a South Korean refiner to a trader at MPM -8 / 9 on Thursday , was heard an exchange for a July Dubai cargo at full-month + 40 . 
but an outright July Oman deal was also heard done between two European majors at Dubai + 67 . 
despite the start of July trading for Middle East crudes , June cargoes are still weighing down the market . 
a Japanese refiner bought one million barrels of end June Oman from a European major , at Dubai + 45 . 
the seller was heard to still be holding June cargoes of Abu Dhabi crudes , although almost all Asian refiners have completed their June programme .
