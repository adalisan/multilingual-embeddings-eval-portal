new Zealand expects a new round of world trade talks in 1999 and sees itself playing a key role as chair of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum at the time , foreign ministry officials said on Friday . 
Richard Nottage , secretary of the Foreign Affairs and Trade Department , told reporters he expected a new round of World Trade Organization ( WTO ) talks aimed at further liberalising global trade in the 21st century . 
&quot; New Zealand will be placed to play a pivotal role . 
the chair of APEC ... puts us in a very unique place , &quot; Nottage said . 
new Zealand in 1999 becomes the chair of APEC , a trade grouping that includes 18 members from Asia and the Americas . 
Peter Kennedy , director of the department &apos;s Economic Division , said there was growing acceptance in the wake of the first ministerial WTO conference in Singapore in December that a new round of full talks was necessary . 
the previous talks , known as the Uruguay Round , stretched over seven years to 1993 and had far-reaching implications in liberalising trade , particularly in agriculture . 
a new cycle of sector-specific talks over farm products and services is due to begin in 1999 and New Zealand expects them to develop into comprehensive , wide-ranging discussions . 
&quot; The timing is such that that could evolve into a new multilateral round . 
there is almost an inevitability given that there are going to be major negotiations in agriculture , services , intellectual property and so on , &quot; Kennedy said . 
&quot; That is not a view shared by everybody . 
the United States quite likes doing sectorial negotiations and they can point to some recent successes in telecommunications and information technology , &quot; he said . 
Kennedy said New Zealand &apos;s experience was that it was more difficult to achieve success in narrow sectoral talks rather than holding broad , multilateral negotiations . 
agricultural exporters such as New Zealand see advantages in extending freer trade in agricultural products , an area in which issues such as export subsidies have not been fully settled . 
a new trade round would seek to get new commitments on free trade from the 130 WTO member states and bind those countries to them , Kennedy said . 
he said agriculture would feature in a new round , as would a move to free up the international aviation market , while some countries want to tighten rules on intellectual property .
