Australian retail trade data issued on Friday implies about a 0.13 percent contribution to quarterly growth in the expenditure measure of gross domestic product ( GDP-E ) , according to a Reuters calculation . 
economists had typically expected a contribution of around 0.3 percent . 
in the June quarter retail sales detracted about 0.14 percent from GDP-E . 
figures released earlier showed Australian retail sales fell 3.7 percent to A $ 10.05 billion in September , seasonally adjusted , after rising 1.1 percent to A $ 10.43 billion in August . 
in the September quarter , real retail sales at constant average 1989 / 90 prices rose 0.6 percent to A $ 25.89 billion seasonally adjusted , from the June quarter . 
BT Australia chief economist Chris Caton said the September falls was overstated . 
&quot; You don &apos;t usually see falls as big as this . 
it is clearly overstated but nevertheless it does mean we are not going to get as much contribution from retail trade in the September quarter as we thought and so we are looking at a weaker growth story , &quot; Caton said .
