Amnesty International has condemned a decision by the Philippine government to deny visas to two Tibetans due to attend an international conference on human rights in China , beginning in Manila on Friday . 
Gedun Rinchen and Tempa Tsering were told by the Philippine Embassy in New Delhi that their presence in the Philippines would be too sensitive , an Amnesty statement said . 
both are based in Dharamsala , India , the base of the Dalai Lama , Tibet &apos;s exiled spiritual leader . 
&quot; This decision is yet another graphic illustration of the way other governments are willing to comply with China &apos;s insistence that its human rights record should not be held up to international scrutiny , &quot; Amnesty said in a joint statement with Forum-Asia , an Asian human rights group . 
&quot; By denying access to Tibetans , the Filipino government is simply echoing China in blocking the fundamental right of freedom of speech , &quot; the statement said .
