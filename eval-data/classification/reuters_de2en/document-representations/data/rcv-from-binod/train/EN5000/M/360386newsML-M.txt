the dollar hit 124 yen for the first time in four years and also gained against the mark Thursday amid hope that finance officials will aim for stable currency rates and a belief that German interest rates may soon head lower . 
volume in the currency markets , however , was subdued as traders awaited the weekend meeting of the G7 as well as a key report on U.S. employment due Friday . 
finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven major industrial powers -- Japan , Germany , Britain , Italy , France , Canada and the United States -- will convene in Berlin Saturday to discuss currency rates , among other things . 
the group was instrumental in boosting the dollar after it plunged to post-World War II lows of 1.3438 marks on March 8 , 1995 and 79.75 yen on April 19 of that year . 
since then , the U.S. currency has risen more than 55 percent against the yen and nearly 24 percent versus the mark . 
on Thursday , the German Finance Ministry characterised recent moves in the currency markets as a &quot; normalization &quot; from conditions prevailing in early 1995 . 
the Ministry said it expects the weekend talks to conclude that current conditions were favourable for continued economic growth due to low interest rates and stable exchange rates . 
French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis also said endless fluctuations in the market must be avoided . 
the U.S. January employment report was preceded by German jobs data released Thursday that helped boost the dollar against the mark . 
the German Federal Labour Department said unemployment surged by more than 500,000 to a new postwar record of 4.66 million in January , a level last seen in the depths of the Great Depression of the 1930s . 
the jobless rate jumped to 12.2 percent in January from 10.8 percent in December . 
the surprisingly weak numbers fuelled speculation that Germany may need to lower interest rates to help stimulate its struggling economy . 
lower rates , however , can hurt the mark by making deposits denominated in the German currency less attractive to investors . 
the weak German economic data &quot; suggest that a rate hike is a long way off and an ease is possible , &quot; said Kevin Harris , an international economist at MCM CurrencyWatch . 
Harris also noted that market interest rates could remain lower amid sluggish economic conditions . 
&quot; Demand for marks on an investment basis is going to soften if it looks like domestic investment in Germany won &apos;t carry as high a return , &quot; he added . 
the dollar surged briefly to 124 yen and to 1.6548 marks in Europe and then retreated . 
in late New York trading Thursday , the dollar was at 123.75 yen , up from 123.30 yen on Wednesday . 
the dollar fetched 1.6525 marks , up from 1.6430 German marks . 
in other trading , the British pound fell to $ 1.6340 from $ 1.6410 . 
the dollar rose to 1.4260 Swiss francs from 1.4245 francs and to Canadian $ 1.3499 from C $ 1.3453 .
