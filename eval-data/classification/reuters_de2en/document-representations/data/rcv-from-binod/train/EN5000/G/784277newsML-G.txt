Sally Gunnell and Tessa Sanderson , Britain &apos;s only two women Olympic champions in the past 25 years , brought their careers to a close in contrasting styles on Thursday . 
Gunnell , 31 , the 1992 Olympic 400 metres hurdles champion , said that injury had forced her to hasten her decision to retire , while Sanderson , 41 , finally called it a day after failing to qualify for the javelin final with a throw of 57.84 metres . 
Sanderson won the Olympic title as long ago as 1984 and first competed for Britain in the Olympic games in 1976 . 
in all she competed in six Olympics , more than any other woman athlete in Olympic history . 
&quot; That &apos;s the end , I will not be making any more comebacks . 
Gunnell announced her retirement after a torn calf muscle injury forced her out of the world championships . 
&quot; Basically the luck has run out , If I &apos;m fit my last major race will be at Gateshead next month . 
&quot; I &apos;ve had some brilliant years , even the last couple of years when I &apos;ve been injured and haven &apos;t won any medals have been good , but the time has come to call it a day . 
Gunnell &apos;s announcement came as no real surprise as she almost quit six weeks ago after losing her form . 
she also spoke then about having a baby , and repeated that on Thursday . 
&quot; It &apos;s time to think about starting a family , go away and eat some chips and put on a couple of stone &quot; she joked . 
Gunnell won the Olympic title in Barcelona in 1992 and the following year collected the world title in Stuttgart , setting a world record time of 52.74 seconds . 
that time has only been bettered twice by Americans Kim Batten ( 52.61 ) and Tonja Buford-Bailey ( 52.62 ) in the 1995 world championship final in Gothenburg . 
Gunnell was unable to defend her title there because of a foot injury , and because of continuing injuries , has never really regained her dominance in the event . 
injury also forced her out of the Olympic semifinal last year after which her retirement was inevitable sooner rather than later . 
only five British women have ever won Olympic golds . 
besides Sanderson and Gunnell , the other winners were Mary Rand ( long jump , 1964 ) , Anne Packer ( 800 , 1964 ) and Mary Peters ( pentathlon , 1972 ) .
