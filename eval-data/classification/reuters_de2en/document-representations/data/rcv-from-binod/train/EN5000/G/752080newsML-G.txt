Alain Prost won a first battle in his bid to move the headquarters of his Formula One team closer to Paris when a French government commission gave the go-ahead to the transfer on Thursday . 
the French decentralisation committee said it had accepted the move from the track of Magny-Cours , a small village in central France , to the Parisian suburb of Versailles . 
but a spokeswoman for Prost said the final decision belonged to Territorial Development minister Dominique Voynet . 
Prost last week threatened to give up the team if the transfer failed to go through .
