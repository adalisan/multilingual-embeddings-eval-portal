Southeast Asian currency dealers sat on their hands on Tuesday , awaiting details of Thailand &apos;s economic rescue package , expected later in the day . 
the package was expected to include measures recommended by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) to resuscitate an economy growing at its slowest pace in a decade . 
the Thai baht was lifted by growing optimism that Thailand would accept IMF support and abide by its tough monetary and fiscal conditions . 
&quot; There were quite positive feelings that the government would accept the IMF &apos;s package . 
this helped strengthen baht sentiment , &quot; a senior dealer at a local bank in Bangkok said . 
the package was expected to include a standby credit and possibly loans to boost the economy . 
analysts say Thailand needs $ 10 billion to $ 20 billion to get its economy back on track . 
Thai Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya said he would hold a news conference after the cabinet discussed the economic package . 
he did not specify a time but said Tuesday &apos;s meeting was expected to be longer than ordinary cabinet meetings , which typically end shortly after midday ( 0500 GMT ) . 
the baht was quoted at 31.44 / 69 to the dollar onshore at 0420 GMT after rising to a high of 31.30 compared with 31.550 late on Monday . 
it was at 31.25 / 50 offshore . 
a U.S. bank dealer in Singapore said dollar buying interest from speculative funds in Hong Kong would limit the baht &apos;s upside to around 31.00 for the time being . 
in Malaysia , the ringgit remained weak but relatively subdued after sliding overnight in thin London markets after the release of an unexpectedly large trade deficit for June . 
&quot; ringgit selling started in London last night after the release of the trade figures and continued in Sydney this morning , &quot; a dealer with a Malaysian bank said . 
but the ringgit &apos;s weakness was limited by dollar offers around the 2.6370 level from Kuala Lumpur banks , dealers said . 
Malaysia reported a trade deficit of 2.8 billion ringgit for June late on Monday following a surplus of 156.2 million in May . 
dealers said the ringgit &apos;s fall was cushioned by the fact that imports of bulky items like ships and planes contributed heavily to the deficit . 
the ringgit was quoted at 2.6325 / 55 to the dollar at 0420 GMT , close to the levels it was trading at before Malaysia &apos;s central bank imposed curbs on currency swaps by Malaysian banks on Sunday . 
the ringgit surged to 2.5800 to the dollar in early Monday trade after Bank Negara said local banks would have to limit their non-trade related currency swaps to $ 2.0 million with each overseas customer . 
but dealers said the gains would be limited as the market was already long the ringgit and onshore banks accounted for only a small portion of liquidity in the forward market . 
&quot; A lot of companies in Malaysia want to be long dollars . 
they &apos;re still afraid of further depreciation of the unit , &quot; the U.S. bank dealer in Singapore said . 
the Indonesian rupiah firmed as tight money market liquidity forced many domestic operators to unload dollars . 
&quot; sentiment on the rupiah seems to improve , in line with a more settled market in Thailand , &quot; a U.S. bank dealer in Jakarta said . 
&quot; Thailand is the locomotive for now . 
if the package agreed with the IMF could regain market confidence , I think we are going to see a broad recovery throughout the region , &quot; he said . 
a local bank dealer said increased rupiah demand in the morning was partly due to higher spot dollar purchases on Friday , which were maturing on Tuesday . 
the Philippine peso recovered from a weak opening , rising to 26.90 / 7.90 to the dollar around 0420 GMT . 
Manila traders said the dollar showed a soft bias as a large inflow of dollars was expected from a corporate client . 
the Philippine central bank said the peso &apos;s depreciation had a minimal impact on inflation , as year-on-year inflation in July was 4.8 percent , unchanged from the previous month &apos;s rate . 
the Taiwan dollar shed some of its early gains but remained relatively firm after foreign fund inflows in late Monday trade helped reverse an earlier downtrend .
