U.S. fob Gulf soybean basis bids were around two to three cents a bushel firmer on old crop supplies Wednesday while the corn basis remained steady . 
dealers said domestic soybean processors had been bidding more aggressively for supplies , forcing exporters to increase their bids in order to compete . 
nearby hard red winter wheat bids were also up sharply as the recent slow pace of producer selling prompted a lack of supplies . 
however , although old crop supplies appear scarce , new crop wheat should start becoming available in three or four weeks . 
corn basis bids were steady .
