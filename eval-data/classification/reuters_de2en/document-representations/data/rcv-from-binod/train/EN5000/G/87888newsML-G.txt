Russian Defence Minister Igor Rodionov appealed to President Boris Yeltsin and the government on Tuesday for urgent funds to ease a crisis in the army before matters get out of control . 
his cry for help provoked an immediate response . 
Yeltsin told Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to convene a special cabinet meeting on army financing and announced that a new defence council would meet on Friday to discuss army reforms . 
&quot; I ask you to convene a government council and for that government council to review the issue of financing for the armed forces , &quot; Yeltsin told Chernomyrdin in brief remarks broadcast on television . 
the president , in hospital preparing for heart surgery in a month or two , looked relaxed and spoke slowly . 
Rodionov played down the threat of a rebellion in the army , saying the situation was manageable for now , but said a backlog of unpaid wages was becoming unbearable . 
we must find a way out of this extremely difficult and critical situation which the army is in today because of the lack of funding , &quot; he told a news confernece . 
he called for unpaid wages to be settled by the end of this year , saying : &quot; The army has denied itself a lot of things that it needs but , if things go on like this , the situation will become intolerable . 
Rodionov said Yeltsin had agreed during talks on Saturday that the situation was unbearable and that action was needed . 
in a sign of deepening concern , Interfax news agency said Yeltsin had discussed army financing with Chernomyrdin on Tuesday and demanded a special cabinet meeting on the issue . 
Yeltsin , who is in hospital preparing for heart surgery , also announced the first meeting on Friday of the newly formed defence council , which is headed by the president and includes top government ministers and security officials . 
Rodionov , who was 60 on Tuesday , said army reform would be on the agenda . 
the meeting will be chaired in Yeltsin &apos;s absence by Chernomyrdin , the council &apos;s deputy chairman . 
Interfax quoted unnamed sources saying the meeting would be largely devoted to the reorganisation of the forces , including troops controlled by ministries other than defence . 
the army , the pride of Soviet society , has suffered from underfunding and low morale since the superpower collapsed in 1991 and many soldiers have not been paid for months . 
many servicemen are unhappy over being dragged into the war in breakaway Chechnya , saying it was not their duty to fight inside the country . 
Lebed , who discussed army reform with Kremlin Chief-of-Staff Anatoly Chubais on Tuesday , said last week that the army was close to mutiny because of mounting frustration . 
Rodionov said there was a danger of discontent growing and leading to &quot; extremely undesirable , uncontrollable processes &quot; , but that the situation was under control for now . 
&quot; In short , the Defence Ministry regards the situation as controllable and manageable but the armed forces are going through a period of sharp crisis , &quot; he said . 
Rodionov said many soldiers &apos; families were in dire straits and there was a tendency towards a decline in combat readiness . 
he said the army faced a tough 1997 because the draft budget falls far short of his ministry &apos;s needs . 
Chernomyrdin has already said he will review defence spending . 
Rodionov supported plans announced by Yeltsin to create a fully professional army but said it would take longer than planned and could be completed only by the year 2005 .
