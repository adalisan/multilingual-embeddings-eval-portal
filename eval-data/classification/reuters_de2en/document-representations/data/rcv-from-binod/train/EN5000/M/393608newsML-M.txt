Lithuanian shares made a slight gain on Friday but volumes remained low , dealers said . 
the group A index inched up by 9.72 points to 2,408.02 in lacklustre central market trade of 751,000 litas . 
gains are seen on the horizon but dealers say the bourse is not set for a bull-run like last month &apos;s , when shares soared steeply to new highs . 
&quot; There is some profit taking right now among some blue-chip holers , &quot; one dealer said . 
but dealers say that most blue chip stocks are now good value and won &apos;t fall much further , if at all . 
&quot; Prices in general have reached their lowest level , &quot; said one broker . 
but investors are still waiting for more news on shares like Lithuania Gas and the Lithuanian Sea Shipping Company . 
&quot; Those shares are quite cheap now , but investors want to see if the government is serious about selling off its majority stake in both companies , &quot; he added . 
Ukio Bank was Friday &apos;s biggest blue chip jump , rising 9.99 percent to 20.91 litas in trade of 48,500 litas . 
Nomura said earlier this year that Ukio was a good equity investment . 
Akmenas cementas also advanced , rising 7.14 percent to 1.50 litas . 
only 1,500 litas worth of its shares were swapped . 
Kalnapilis lost ground , falling 9.97 percent to 6.14 litas in trade of 33,000 litas . 
Birzai Milk also lost ground , declining five percent to 7.60 litas . 
block trades reached 286,000 litas on Friday . 
investors continued to show little appetite for Lithuanian debt , with the secondary T-bill market turning over just 95,630 litas .
