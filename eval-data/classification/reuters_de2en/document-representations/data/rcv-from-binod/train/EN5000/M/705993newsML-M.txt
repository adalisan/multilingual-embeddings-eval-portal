wall Street stocks were expected to open higher on Thursday after the release of a report on June U.S. payrolls , wages and employment , market analysts said . 
the following are their comments : 
-- &quot; This confirms the decision by the Fed yesterday as a good decision . 
-- &quot; The numbers are just about in line , although the rise in the unemployment number is a bit of a surprise . 
the four cent hourly wage rise is in line with forecasts and no big deal , so all in all these are favorable numbers and show no real wage pressures . 
the Labor Department reported June nonfarm payrolls up 217,000 , compared with a revised 166,000 in May . 
the June jobless rate rose to 5.0 percent from 4.8 percent . 
economists polled by Reuters had estimated on average that payrolls would grow by 222,000 jobs in June . 
unemployment rate was expected at 4.8 percent . 
-- &quot; The data couldn &apos;t be better . 
it was in line with expectations and the details were good . 
the unemployment rate was unchanged , which was good . 
the gain in hourly earnings was quite moderate . 
-- &quot; On the whole , it looks like the apparent momentum for wages has slowed , which is exactly what the market was looking for . 
stocks could open considerably higher . 
all of the sellers are out of the market . 
-- &quot; I think the payroll number was right on target , so that should be a positive for the stock market and the bond market . 
the pickup in the unemployment rate has to be seen as a positive for both the bond and the stock markets , and it underlines that Fed policy established yesterday with their holding the line was definitely the right way to go because we &apos;re definitely seeing a slowdown here . 
I think those numbers are certainly going to make for a good Fourth of July holiday . 
the 30-year Treasury bond jumped 28 / 32 , its yield dropping to 6.64 percent from Wednesday &apos;s close at 6.71 percent .
