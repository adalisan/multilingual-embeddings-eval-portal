England &apos;s top rugby players took a calculated gamble on Wednesday as they defied the Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) and allied themselves with the breakaway clubs who intend to declare independence from Twickenham next month . 
by refusing to turn up for an RFU training session and attending a meeting organised by the English Professional Rugby Clubs ( EPRUC ) , the 43-man squad finally made their move after months of wrangling over who controls their destiny in the new professional era . 
a brief statement , released without further comment by EPRUC chairman Donald Kerr , said the players had decided &quot; the best way forward for the game is to agree in principle with EPRUC &apos;s vision of the future . 
none of the squad would talk afterwards , many of them leaving the hotel where the meeting took place by an underground entrance but EPRUC , who represent the first and second division clubs , claimed the message to the RFU was unanimous . 
&quot; If you want to read into this that England players agree to the breakaway , then fine , &quot; conceded Kerr . 
he refused to confirm when EPRUC and the players would meet again , and the ball now appears to be firmly at the feet of the RFU . 
the union expressed &quot; disappointment the clubs have seen fit to use the players as a negotiating tool &quot; in the continuing struggle over power and money in English domestic rugby , but now face the sobering possibility of losing their top players as well as their Five Nations status by early next week . 
the other four nations are set to meet in Dublin on Monday with England expected to be thrown out of the tournament in a row over television revenue . 
even if they are granted a late reprieve , however , the players &apos; latest move could mean the official England team bears no resemblance to the one supporters have cheered in recent seasons . 
RFU secretary Tony Hallett is likely to restate the union &apos;s case on Thursday , but the situation is fast slipping away from him . 
the players &apos; international contracts ran out last weekend and they have been swiftly reminded it is the clubs not Twickenham who are currently their sole paymasters . 
many have signed contracts worth at least 50,000 pounds for their clubs , although they have the potential to earn at least double that through their England involvement . 
it was always unlikely the traditionally conservative RFU would find it easy to make the transition to a professional sport , but the players now find themselves caught in the middle of a bitter dispute . 
&quot; We are being used as pawns , &quot; admitted forward Tim Rodber . 
&quot; We would rather be playing or training , but the meeting was necessary to find out our position . 
with Welsh clubs and Scottish players also involved in disputes with their unions , British rugby is descending rapidly into farce . 
England coach Jack Rowell and other RFU staff turned up as scheduled for the lunchtime training session , only to find they had no players to work with . 
a scrummaging machine was driven through the gates of Bisham Abbey , normally home to the England soccer team , only to be towed back out again within half an hour as the managament opted to retire for lunch instead . 
there were even claims on Wednesday that former England captain Will Carling could be playing rugby league for Bradford bulls next year , as part of the deal which has brought New Zealander Robbie Paul to London club Harlequins . 
Carling , omitted from the 43-man training squad but still in England contention , is unlikely to be thrilled by the Bradford offer but he , like everyone else in rugby , is fast discovering the new commercial realities . 
these were summed up when millionaire Sir John Hall , owner of Newcastle United &apos;s soccer team and a member of the EPRUC board , revealed he had interrupted his holiday in Spain to attend the negotiations with the players . 
&quot; It is very satisfying to realise that the players have stayed away from training , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We are sticking together for the good of the game . 
the RFU might dispute that , but sports minister Iain Sproat is among the thousands of supporters whose frustration is growing . 
speaking from Westminster on Wednesday , he called for someone to &quot; knock some heads together &quot; to end what he called a &quot; fiasco &quot; .
