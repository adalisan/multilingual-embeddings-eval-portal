former US Masters champion Ian Woosnam said on Tuesday that he would &quot; live with the pain &quot; of his bad back rather than undergo surgery . 
the world number 28 , runner-up to Colin Montgomerie in this year &apos;s European Tour order of merit , said he had seen a specialist who advised against an operation . 
&quot; The specialist told me I will just have to live with the pain , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I have a vertebra that wants coming out , but it can wait for two or three years . 
I am going to keep on playing and put up with the spasms and back pain . 
&quot; My main problem is muscular and the doctor reckons I have got to live with it and take whatever he gives me for the pain , &quot; Woosnam said . 
the 38-year-old Welshman is competing in the Johnnie Walker Super Tour with European number one Colin Montgomerie , Ernie Els , world ranked three , Fiji &apos;s Vijay Singh and four leading Asian players . 
the 72-hole event teed off at the Ta Shee Golf Club in Taipei on Tuesday morning . 
other rounds are to be played in Seoul , Manila and Bangkok over the next six days .
