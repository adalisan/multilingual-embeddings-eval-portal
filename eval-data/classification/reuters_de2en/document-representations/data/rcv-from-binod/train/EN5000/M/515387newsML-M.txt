the Philipines &apos; central bank has postponed the launch of its inaugural Yankee bond issue because of poor market conditions , the bank said in a statement released by lead manager Salomon Brothers on Wednesday . 
&quot; Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas led by Governor Gabriel C. Singson has decided to reset the timing of the launch of its Yankee bond offering due to the highly unfavorable bond market conditions in the last few days , &quot; the statement said . 
the central bank had planned to launch up to US $ 1.0 billion in Yankee bonds in tranches of 30- and 100-years on April 15 . 
the central bank said the decision was shared by lead manager Salomon Brothers and the deal &apos;s co-managers because of &quot; the sharp increase in long-term U.S. Treasury bond yields and the concurrent widening of secondary market trading levels for a range of comparable issuers . 
the central bank said that other sovereign issuers also have elected to reset their offerings in anticipation of improved market conditions , but did not specifiy which other borrowers have postponed issues . 
&quot; While present volatile market conditions do not currently allow the BSP to achieve its strategic objectives for the bond offering , the very positive investor response to the creditworthiness of both the BSP and the Republic of the Philippines generated through the U.S. roadshow programme is nevertheless very encouraging , &quot; Singson said in the statement . 
according to the central bank statement , Salomon Brothers confirmed that while the response to the roadshow presentations was very strong , the current uncertainty about the interest rate environment has caused spreads overall to widen .
