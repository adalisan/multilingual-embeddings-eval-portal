two mines exploded on Tuesday in the Burundian capital Bujumbura on the road to the airport , killing four civilians and wounding a dozen on a bus , officials said . 
army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Isaie Nibizi said the army deplored the deaths of three innocent civilians and an investigation was underway &quot; with serious leads &quot; . 
he gave no more details . 
the independent radio production house Studio Ijambo quoted an official as saying one of the 13 wounded died later of his wounds in hospital , bringing the total death toll to four . 
it said body parts of the dead at the scene were scattered around the road near where the bus was hit by the blasts at about six a.m. ( 0400 GMT ) on the road to the airport . 
it said bursts of gunfire were heard in the hills surrounding Bujumbura moments after the two explosions and some of the 13 wounded head already left hospital in the capital . 
the mine blasts were the second such attack around Bujumbura this month . 
five people are held by authorities in connection with mine blasts in Bujumbura that killed four people on March 12 and an alleged plot to assassinate military ruler Pierre Buyoya , who seized power with the Tutsi-dominated army last July . 
Buyoya left by plane from Bujumbura airpport on Tuesday for an Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) summit in Lome , Togo , on the war in Zaire , Burundi &apos;s western neighbour , officials said . 
they declined to comment when asked whether the mine blasts were a second attempt to assassinate Buyoya , who had delayed his trip to Bujumbura airport from the morning to the afternoon . 
senior officials were unavailable to comment because they had also gone to Lome . 
regional states imposed sanctions on Burundi and a travel ban on Burundian officials shortly after the July coup and demanded talks between the government and Hutu rebels led by Leonard Nyangoma . 
but Buyoya , a retired army major , was invited to the OAU summit because the continental organisation has not approved the sanctions although OAU officials have said they support them . 
Congo said on Thursday it had opened an air corridor to Burundi despite the regional sanctions as the United Nations had not decreed the embargo so Lome could do what it wanted . 
authorities said two weeks ago they had arrested eight people including five members of the Parena party , led by former military ruler Jean-Baptiste Bagaza , who were suspected of involvement in the plot to kill Buyoya and the mine blasts . 
Buyoya ousted Bagaza from power in 1987 . 
both are Tutsis but Bagaza , a hardliner , has been under house arrest since January . 
more than 150,000 people have been killed in massacres and civil war between Hutu rebels and the army since the killing of Burundi &apos;s first freely elected Hutu president in October 1993 . 
the army said last week Hutu rebels killed 135 civilians in &quot; regroupment camps &quot; guarded by the military in northwest Burundi by shooting them and slashing them to death with machetes . 
U.N. officials have expressed deep concern at the camps , where more than 200,000 Hutu peasants and Tutsis have been assembled since last October . 
a Hutu politician has said they were the Tutsi army &apos;s equivalent of concentration camps .
