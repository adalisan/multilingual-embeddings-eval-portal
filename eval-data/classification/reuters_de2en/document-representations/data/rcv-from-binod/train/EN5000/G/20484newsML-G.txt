Philippine government and Moslem rebel negotiators took their final steps down the road to peace on Wednesday , with both sides expecting a smooth run in two days of talks in Jakarta . 
&quot; We are now at the end of the road and this is the road to peace , &quot; said Nur Misuari , leader of the Moslem separatist Moro National Liberation Front ( MNLF ) . 
Misuari and government delegation leader Manuel Yan had separate courtesy meetings with Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas before the formal talks got under way . 
Indonesia has chaired a six-nation ministerial committee from the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) which has facilitated the peace talks to end a 24-year Moslem revolt in the southern Philippines which has claimed some 125,000 lives . 
the five million Moslems on Mindanao regard the area as their ancestral homeland , although they now are outnumbered by Christian migrants . 
Christian politicians and their followers have vowed to fight the peace deal , which involves a three-year interim Council for Peace and Development , to be followed in 1999 by a plebiscite leading to an autonomous regional government . 
Yan conceded on Tuesday there were opponents of the peace accord . 
&quot; But those are in some areas only , and I believe the majority of the people there are for this council to be set up as a transitional structure leading towards regional autonomy , &quot; he told Reuters . 
the peace agreement is due to be initialled by both parties in front of Indonesian President Suharto on Friday , and will then be formally signed in Manila on Monday . 
foreign Minister Alatas said various points of contention had already been settled , including the numbers of MNLF guerrillas to be integrated into the Philippine armed forces and composition of a police force for the Mindanao region . 
he said the most important breakthrough had been agreement on how to implement the peace accord through creation of the Southern Philippine Council for Peace and Development . 
&quot; We have finally come to the end of the road of negotiations that will provide an end to conflict and tension in the southern Philippines , &quot; he added . 
Alatas said the peace agreement was also a success for the seven-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , which comprises Indonesia , the Philippines , Malaysia , Singapore , Thailand , Vietnam and Brunei . 
&quot; By this agreement , ASEAN countries have once again shown their capacity for peaceful resolution of problems in their region , &quot; he said . 
Islamic states had sought to mediate in the conflict in the mid-1970s , but it was only in 1993 that concrete moves towards peace got under way with Indonesia chairing the OIC ministerial committee . 
Philippine and Indonesian officials said the peace accord would give a major boost to proposals for an East ASEAN Development Region taking in the southern Philippines , east Malaysia and eastern Indonesia . 
Alatas said IOC members had shown an interest in promoting investment in the region , although this was still at an exploratory stage .
