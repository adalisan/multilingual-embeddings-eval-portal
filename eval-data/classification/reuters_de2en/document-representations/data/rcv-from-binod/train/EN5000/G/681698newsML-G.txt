Hong Kong &apos;s democratically elected chamber began its final legislative session on Monday before China disbands the assembly at midnight on June 30 . 
fewer than half of the Legislative Council &apos;s 60 members were present at the start of the five-day session , billed as a marathon sitting with debates and voting on 14 government bills and 17 draft laws expected to take place . 
in just eight days , the assembly , elected in September 1995 in the most democratic polls in Hong Kong &apos;s political history , will itself be relegated to the history books . 
China plans to replace it with an interim legislature -- the provisional legislative council formed under its auspices last December . 
at a stroke , Beijing will erase the democratic reforms introduced by the British-led administration in the twilight years of its 156-year colonial rule . 
the future chamber has already passed laws which will ban foreign funding for local political groups and empower police to stop protests deemed to threaten China &apos;s &quot; national security &quot; . 
in the early hours of July 1 , the chamber will occupy the Legislative Council building and &quot; confirm &quot; these new laws . 
although 33 incumbent lawmakers are members of the interim chamber , the popular Democratic Party , the largest in the territory with 19 members in the current legislature , will have no representation in the new body . 
in the dignified chamber , its walls covered with dark-brown wooden panelling , about 20 legislators went through the motions of debate on such mundane topics as bribery prevention and ways of guarding against landslides in typhoon season . 
the laws will remain on the statute book unless a future legislature votes to scrap them . 
the seemingly uneventful sitting belied the deep , confused feelings of the pro-democracy camp legislators . 
we must rush through with all these bills and pass them . 
it &apos;s not ideal , but we cannot change reality as we will not have another sitting , &quot; independent legislator Leung Yiu-chung told Reuters . 
Leung , who will go back to teaching after July 1 , plans to contest Hong Kong &apos;s first post-handover elections in 1998 . 
Szeto Wah , a founder member of the Democratic Party , said he felt &quot; very peaceful , although it &apos;s close to the handover and it &apos;s the last sitting of Legco . 
but what is coming has long been expected . 
&quot; But we will stick to our principles , to welcome the handover and fight for democracy , &quot; Szeto told Reuters . 
Szeto &apos;s party colleague Tsang Kin-shing , dubbed &quot; The Bull &quot; in the local media for his fiery temper , said he no longer planned to tie himself to the chamber &apos;s granite columns on the eve of the handover as he had threatened to do . 
instead , he said , he and 18 other Democratic Party lawmakers would stage a protest on the Legislative Council &apos;s balcony to express their anger at being kicked out of the chamber midway through what should have been a four-year term . 
&quot; On the balcony , we will tell the public why we have to leave . 
not because we want to , but because we are forced to . 
it is not just the democrats who will be kicked out as July 1 approaches . 
also doomed is the high wooden chair adorned with the royal crown on which the president of the council has sat since 1985 . 
the large Hong Kong government crest complete with crown which adorned the front of the chamber , and to which lawmakers have bowed deferentially for decades , is also to be ripped off . 
&quot; The chair will definitely go , probably to a museum , and of course the crest too , &quot; a Legco secretariat spokesman said .
