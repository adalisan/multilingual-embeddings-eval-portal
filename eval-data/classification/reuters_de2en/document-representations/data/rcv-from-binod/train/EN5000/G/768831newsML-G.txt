Mozambique &apos;s three-year-old democracy faces a key test as the formerly Marxist-led country , emerging from 16 years of ruinous civil war , prepares for its first municipal elections on December 27 . 
the economy is improving , but the political landscape remains dominated by divisions of the past . 
the governing FRELIMO party and former Renamo rebels have cooperated to pass legislation that has transformed the country from its Marxist past but relations remain strained . 
while investment and trade have boomed , winning plaudits from the international donor community , ordinary Mozambicans have so far felt little change . 
&quot; In 1994 people voted for peace -- they wanted reconciliation . 
now peace is not enough , they still don &apos;t have food , education and health , &quot; said one aid official . 
municipal elections will cover 33 cities and towns and will take the load off central government , placing resources in the hands of elected public officers . 
political analysts say that while parties agree that local elections must take place , many believe the date is too soon to allow proper preparations , and impractical coming straight after Christmas . 
&quot; The election is crucial and is the first step on power-sharing . 
the elections have to happen or the country &apos;s image will suffer . 
if they lose this opportunity it will be bad for the country and could put stability at risk , &quot; one analyst said . 
&quot; But the date is wrong and no one wants to be the first to admit it . 
the first national census since 1980 will be held next month , at the same time as registration . 
analysts say there will not be time to prepare properly and have urged both sides to delay the poll by two months until after the rainy season . 
some say the donor community , funding the election at a cost of $ 14 million , might have to take the first step . 
&quot; The international community doesn &apos;t want to be seen supporting elections that aren &apos;t transparent , &quot; one election official said . 
&quot; There is always a risk , but I believe we can keep within the timetable and be ready in time , &quot; Leonardo Simbine , chairman of the Comissao Nacional de Eleicoes ( CNE ) overseeing the election , told Reuters . 
Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama said elections were necessary . 
&quot; The elections are good to consolidate peace . 
people want to see changes . 
all those billions of dollars from the donor community has gone to FRELIMO and not to the people , &quot; he told Reuters . 
political tensions have risen ahead of the election . 
some diplomats have cautioned the government against taking populist actions to win votes , reminding it of the danger in disrupting the current economic stability . 
&quot; Over the next three years the government has to continue with reform and populist moves could jeopardise its position in the donor community , &quot; one senior economist said . 
debate between the two factions over the elections , which required constitutional changes , has been confrontational and the most acrimonious since 1994 , diplomats say . 
&quot; The international community made it clear to Renamo that its strategy was counterproductive , &quot; a European diplomat said . 
analysts say that if the results are similar to the outcome of the 1994 national poll , FRELIMO should take about 18 municipalities . 
Renamo support , mainly among peasants , is largely expected in Sofala , Zambezia and Nampula provinces , including the second largest city , Beira .
