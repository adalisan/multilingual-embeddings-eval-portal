Chancellor Helmut Kohl received a strong endorsement from his heir-apparent on Tuesday to run for a record fifth term , despite growing industrial and social upheaval which has shaken confidence in his leadership . 
in the latest mass demonstration , tens of thousands of irate steelworkers protested in the financial capital Frankfurt . 
they were objecting to plans to restructure Germany &apos;s two big steelmakers which are likely to cost thousands of jobs in depressed areas . 
political and worker pressure , driven by fears that Germany &apos;s consensus economics was being sacrificed to naked capitalism , helped to push Fried . 
Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp into dropping a hostile takeover bid of rival Thyssen AG in favour of a more limited steel joint venture . 
despite the partial victory for advocates of cooperation between industry , politicians , banks and workers , Kohl &apos;s powerful lieutenant Wolfgang Schaeuble warned of trouble ahead as planned cuts in pensions and welfare are pushed through . 
&quot; In Germany , even small changes turn into big conflicts ... We must not try to pretend we can construct a zone where there will be no conflict , &quot; he told the weekly Die Zeit . 
Schaeuble , the architect of attempts to reform the welfare state , is seen as Kohl &apos;s chosen successor after telling an interviewer early this year he was tempted by the chancellery . 
that comment , together with a remark by Kohl that he would consider his future after a European Union summit in June , prompted feverish speculation last month that Kohl , 66 , might quit before the next general election in late 1998 . 
but Schaeuble compared Kohl to legendary chancellor Konrad Adenauer , whose post-war record of over 14 years in office Kohl broke last year , and said people should vote for Kohl in 1998 , 2002 and even 2006 . 
&quot; He &apos;s not even as old now as Adenauer was when he became chancellor , &quot; said Schaeuble , parliamentary leader of Kohl &apos;s conservative Christian Democrats . 
Kohl does , however , have a mountain to climb to persuade Germans there will soon be relief for 4.7 million unemployed , the highest number since 1933 . 
the steelworkers turned their anger on the banks who they accuse of organising a cloak-and-dagger operation , motivated by greed , to rationalise Germany &apos;s steel industry by force . 
but they also expressed deeper fears that Kohl &apos;s government was sacrificing the prosperity which they had become used to in 40 years of consensus economics . 
&quot; The parties and the parliament have to ask themselves who it is that rules us -- the democratically-elected government or the unchecked finance centres of the big banks , &quot; Klaus Zwickel , head of the engineering union IG Metall , told the steelworkers . 
the demonstrators were following a path beaten this month by miners and building workers who both used mass protests over job losses to gain public sympathy and wring money out of Bonn . 
with economic sentiment at its lowest level for decades , few Germans see any advantages in the planned single currency which Kohl sees as the cement to hold together the European Union . 
the burden of unemployment has also severely undermined Bonn &apos;s struggle to rein in its budget to qualify for the new currency . 
finance Minister Theo Waigel said last week monetary union might force him to make further welfare cuts . 
but Kohl himself , in an article in a banking industry newspaper , told Germans these efforts would pay off when the new currency allowed the EU &apos;s common market &quot; to develop its full benefit for growth and jobs &quot; .
