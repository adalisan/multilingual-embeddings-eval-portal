Jordanian businessmen trying to sell goods to Iraq face an uphill struggle against competition from other countries and lingering political difficulties , traders said on Thursday . 
Baghdad traders said Ankara and Dubai were offering cheaper and better products than Amman , which turned against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in 1995 but is now seeking stronger trade links . 
&quot; We are slowly switching to Turkey and the United Arab Emirates ( U.A.E. ) . 
terms are better , cost of transport lower , &quot; said one trader . 
the Jordanian businessmen were hoping for trade under a deal between Baghdad and the United Nations that allows Baghdad to export $ 2 billion worth of oil over six months to buy humanitarian imports . 
the head of the visiting Jordanian business delegation , Khaldun Abuhassan , chairman of Amman Chamber of Industry , said on Wednesday his group of 37 businessmen and industrialists had won several contracts but gave no details . 
two Jordanian ministers who visited Baghdad last week to increase trade left Iraq with neither country reporting if a deal was signed . 
Baghdad shops indicate trade is going to Turkey and U.A.E. 
most sweets , detergents and canned food on display are Turkish , while Iraqi imports of Indian and Pakistani rice , sugar and pulses are arriving via U.A.E. 
&quot; I think the days of Jordan being Iraq &apos;s main exporter of goods are waning . 
we the private traders are slowly switching to Turkey and the U.A.E. , &quot; said another trader . 
&quot; Look closely at the commodities in my supermarket . 
now most of them come from Turkey and the U.A.E. 
in the past 90 per cent would be Jordanian , &quot; he said . 
trade with Iraq , under a U.N. embargo imposed for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait , is forbidden apart from food , medicine and other goods of a humanitarian nature . 
the Iraqi trade is vital for Jordan , which had sympathised with Baghdad during the Gulf crisis caused by Iraq &apos;s invasion of Kuwait . 
but Jordan &apos;s King Hussein turned against the Iraqi leader as he moved closer to the United States . 
U.N. relief officials , who will supervise the distribution of goods bought by Iraq under the oil deal , confirm that most of the commodities will be imported at the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr and not through the Jordanian port of Aqaba . 
&quot; Umm Qasr is much closer to Iraqi markets than Aqaba . 
sea transport is cheaper and Iraq intends to import large proportion of goods from Pakistan , India and southeast Asian markets , &quot; said one official . 
in addition , Iraqi traders said they started shunning Jordan after it intensified searches of Iraq-bound goods in 1995 . 
Iraqis can go to Jordan without visas but both Turkey and the U.A.E have eased visa restrictions for Iraqi businessmen . 
&quot; Dubai is our haven now . 
it is a duty free market , offers a wide range of goods at reasonable prices and now we are finding it easier to enter and even set up our own offices and firms , &quot; said one Baghdad trader whose shop was stuffed with watches and household utensils mostly imported from Dubai . 
is now campaigning to reconcile Arab countries that have shunned Baghdad since 1990 . 
on Wednesday a U.A.E. 
Group sailed for Iraq with 32 tonnes of baby milk and medicine .
