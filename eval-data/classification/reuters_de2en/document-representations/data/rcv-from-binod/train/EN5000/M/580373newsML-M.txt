NYMEX gasoline was called higher Tuesday on news of a blast at Citgo Petroleum Corp &apos;s 150,00 barrel per day ( bpd ) refinery in Corpus Christi , Texas . 
crude was seen consolidating Monday &apos;s sharp gains although the blockade of the Sullom Voe oil port by Shetland fisherman has delayed the loading schedule for Brent crude . 
gasoline was called 0.25 to 0.50 cent gallon higher while heating oil was called steady to 0.25 cent a gallon lower . 
crude was called steady to five cents lower a barrel . 
the blast at the Corpus Christi refinery occurred in one of the plant &apos;s process units and a fire that followed the blast is under control and will be allowed to burn out , local emergency services officials said . 
the cause of the explosion is still under investigation , fire officials said . 
meanwhile , local police reached the blockade at Sullom Voe this morning in an attempt to break up it up . 
&quot; The delay has not been for that long , &quot; said Victor Yu , vice president of Refco Inc , who said the blockade has so far not a had a material impact on supply . 
meanwhile , fresh fighting in Nigeria &apos;s oil-producing Niger delta has forced oil giant Royal Dutch Shell Group to cut Nigerian oil output by more than 10 percent . 
but traders were shrugging off the news , noting the region &apos;s common operational shutdowns of late . 
&quot; There are so many shutdowns there that until we see an actual force majeure , then we will respond , &quot; said a New York trader . 
Monday , June crude oil closed up 95 cents at $ 21.38 a barrel , having peaked at $ 21.55 , after gapping up at the open through a key technical resistance level just above $ 20.50 . 
June gasoline ended up 1.58 cents at 64.47 cents a gallon while June heating oil settled up 2.13 cents at 56.65 cents .
