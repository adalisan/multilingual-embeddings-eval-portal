continuing a trend started at the beginning of the week , prices of investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds rose on Wednesday , while junk prices slumped in listless trading , market players said . 
&quot; The broader high-grade market , particularly higher-yielding paper , is being lifted by improving technicals and fundamentals in several sectors , &quot; said Joseph Labriola , head of high-grade research at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
he noted gains in bank sector preferred stock and cable and media sector straight debt had helped fuel the rally in the overall high-grade market . 
&quot; Although there will be a flurry of new debt issuance , there is no longer a fear that a big overhang of supply will put pressure on secondary market spreads , &quot; he added . 
Labriola said many issuers would wait until rates were lower before issuing more debt . 
in the primary market , high-grade issuers sold $ 1.4 billion in new debt on Wednesday . 
no junk deals were priced . 
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co Inc sold $ 500 million in bonds and Lehman Brothers sold $ 300 million of debt . 
Tosco Corp , which refines and markets petroleum products , sold $ 600 million via Morgan Stanley &amp; Co Inc . 
in junk , overall market prices were down 1 / 8 to 3 / 8 in light trading . 
spreads tightened relative to treasuries , however , as prices in the government market fell even further . 
the price of the 30-year benchmarket Treasury fell 20 / 32 to 95-21 / 32 . 
its yield , which moves inversely to price , rose to 6.84 percent . 
elsewhere in the junk market , trump Castle bonds dropped to 81 from 85 1 / 2 on continued concerns about the company &apos;s earnings , traders said . 
junk bonds in the paper sector also fell today . 
Riverwood International and Wisconsin Repap bonds fell by one point , traders said . 
Sharyl Van winkle , paper sector high-yield analyst at Merrill Lynch , said the reason for the price drop was that investors are reassessing their views on the sector . 
bonds in the paper sector have experienced a substantial rally over the past month and a half , rallying by 115 basis points on average , she noted . 
&quot; The paper sector has tightened in an environment where the news is definitely not getting better . 
basically ( paper ) prices are still declining and that will hurt these companies &apos; revenues , &quot; she said .
