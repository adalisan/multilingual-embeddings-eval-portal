the Indian rupee will remain firm and overvalued against the dollar in the short term on weak dollar demand and central bank concerns about inflation , dealers said on Wednesday . 
the rupee has traded in a broad 35.80-35.90 per dollar range since mid-1996 despite the dollar &apos;s appreciation against other major world currencies . 
earlier in April , the rupee touched a four-month high of 35.75 against the dollar . 
in afternoon trade on Wednesday , the rupee was quoted 35.76 / 77 . 
&quot; The basic problem is one of lack of demand for dollars , &quot; said the chief dealer at a European bank . 
&quot; The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) can give nudges ( to the rate ) or signals of where it wants the rupee-dollar rate to be , &quot; said the dealer , who declined to be identified . 
&quot; But this will not solve the main problem -- of mismatch in demand and supply . 
&quot; I think you can see the trend from yesterday &apos;s movements , &quot; the dealer said . 
&quot; The rupee looks like moving up , RBI steps in , the rupee drops , and once RBI goes out , the rupee bounces back . 
the rupee opened Tuesday at 35.76 / 77 per dollar and fell briefly to 35.77 / 78 on RBI dollar purchases before rallying to close at 35.75 / 76 . 
a slowdown in industrial growth is seen as the critical factor behind the poor dollar demand from importers . 
the Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) , in its annual report on India , said the initial vigour of industrial growth , following deregulation and the rationalisation and reduction of import tariffs , had slackened in 1996 / 97 . 
it attributed the decline to lower export growth , the dampening effect of financial stringency and infrastructure constraints . 
dealers said the slowdown in industrial growth had affected imports and led to reduced dollar demand . 
&quot; In fact the level of demand is so low at present that even normal dollar supplies are pushing the rupee up , &quot; said the chief dealer at a state-run bank . 
compounding the problems for the country &apos;s exchange rate managers is the expansionary effect of central bank intervention on domestic monetary supply . 
dollar purchases by the RBI inject rupees into the banking system , boosting liquidity and stoking inflationary pressures . 
market sources said the RBI bought over $ 1.0 billion in March alone to stem the rupee &apos;s rise . 
but in the last two weeks , dealers said , the central bank has now started to ease up on its dollar purchases as it weighs the effects of its intervention on domestic liquidity . 
concerns over inflation led the RBI to scale down its target on M3 money supply expansion to 15.0-15.5 percent for 1997 / 98 ( April-March ) from 15.6 percent in 1996 / 97 . 
year-on-year inflation , measured by the wholesale price index , was 6.99 percent for the week ended April 5 against 5.23 last year . 
RBI chief Chakravarty Rangarajan has admitted that monetary expansion would have a bearing on the level of central bank intervention in the forex market . 
&quot; We are concerned as always with the real effective exchange rate of the rupee as it has a bearing on the competitiveness of India &apos;s exports , &quot; Rangarajan recently told Reuters Television .
