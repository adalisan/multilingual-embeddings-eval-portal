the Thai central bank on Thursday categorically denied rumours in the foreign exchange market that the baht may be devalued . 
&quot; We wish to categorically deny some rumours in the market that the baht may be devalued . 
the baht is only weak against the the U.S. dollar because the dollar is now very strong , &quot; a senior Bank of Thailand ( Bot ) official told Reuters . 
the baht dropped sharply to 25.823 / 828 against the dollar as of 0247 GMT against 25.798 / 25.808 late on Wednesday . 
the central bank fixed the baht-dollar midrate at 25.79 on Thursday , the lowest level since August 20 , 1991 when it was fixed at 25.82 . 
&quot; The rumours in the market are unfounded . 
the central bank is closely monitoring the baht now , &quot; the Bot official said . 
he added that the some in the market may have misunderstood a statement last week by deputy central bank governor Chaiyawat Wibulsawasdi that domestic borrowers should hedge their borrowings in foreign currencies to minimise foreign exchange risks . 
&quot; What the deputy governor had meant was that people should be aware of the current currency volatility and that they should take precautions not to get hurt by any wide fluctuations , &quot; the official added . 
the baht has gradually slipped sharply against the dollar since late last year on the American unit &apos;s surge against other major currencies . 
foreign exchange dealers said the devaluation rumour was spread by some offshore speculators who wanted to move the market and take advantage of the baht &apos;s steep slide against the dollar .
