Japan will reduce the interest rates on the $ 1.757 billion debt owed by Peru to between 2.5 percent and three percent annually , state news agency Andina said on Saturday . 
Andina , quoting Peruvian Economy Minister Jorge Camet , said the agreement on interest rates was fixed in a bilateral accord under the umbrella of the government &apos;s continuing negotiations with the 14 members of the Paris Club of creditors . 
Peru reached a preliminary restructuring agreement with the Paris Club in July . 
Andina said Peru had already begun bilateral negotiations with Spain under the Paris Club accord , and would start talks with the United Kingdom in the week ahead .
