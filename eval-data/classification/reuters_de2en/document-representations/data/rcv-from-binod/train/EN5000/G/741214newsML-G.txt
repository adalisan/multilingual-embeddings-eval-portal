Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic has said she would not shy away from arresting her nationalist hardline rivals led by indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic . 
&quot; The constitution gives me the right to deploy the army or the police -- as a last resort , &quot; Plavsic told the German magazine Der Spiegel in an interview to be published on Monday . 
she said Karadzic , the former Bosnian Serb leader , and his supporters had been involved in corruption , helping dozens of companies dodge massive amounts of customs duty . 
asked why she did not simply arrest the culprits , she replied : &quot; I will not be deterred from doing that if it is the last chance to save our people . 
but she added such arrests would be difficult to carry out . 
&quot; Even the interior minister ( Dragan Kijac ) whom I have dismissed belongs to those whom I call criminals , &quot; she said in the interview , which was released by Spiegel ahead of publication . 
Plavsic said she could not extradite Karadzic to the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal at the Hague , where he has been indicted on charges of genocide , because it was not allowed under the Bosnian Serb constitution . 
&quot; He &apos;s also not guilty in the sense of the charges . 
he was a slave to his masters in Belgrade , &quot; she said . 
Plavsic said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had offered not to pursue Karadzic if he agreed to leave Bosnia for good . 
but Karadzic had rejected the idea . 
&apos; Karadzic is at fault for everything , &quot; Plavsic told Spiegel . 
&quot; He &apos;s behaving like a mother who gives birth to a child and then claims the right to kill it . 
Plavsic is engaged in a bitter power struggle with Karadzic . 
she dissolved parliament and called fresh elections earlier this month to prevent his supporters ousting her from her post . 
the Bosnian Serb constitutional court suspended the move a few days later while it considers whether Plavsic had acted within her power .
