Bundesbank council member Hans-Juergen Koebnick said on Wednesday that he saw no sign of inflationary pressures in consumer prices or in other measures of price pressures such as producer costs . 
speaking to reporters , Koebnick said that moderate domestic economic growth and modest increases in domestic costs such as wages meant that there was no danger of inflation picking up in the future . 
he also noted that M3 growth had slowed appreciably to 8.3 percent in March . 
&quot; Perhaps the April figure , which will be presented this week , will show us further improvement , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But it remains to be seen whether there will be movement into the target corridor soon . 
the Bundesbank has set a target of 3.5 to 6.5 percent for 1997 . 
Koebnick said comparatively strong lending to the private sector and to the public sector were driving money supply growth and that the counterweight of money capital formation was too light as was often the case at times of low interest rates .
