Japan should not run a significant surplus in its trade account , Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said in a speech on Tuesday . 
&quot; It is not permissible for one nation to be the sole winner ( in global trade ) , &quot; Mitsuzuka said . 
Mitsuzuka added that , in general , if Japan continued to run a surplus it would result in the strengthening of the yen and eventually an economic slowdown and a decrease in exports . 
he also said a continued surplus would lead to severe trade friction .
