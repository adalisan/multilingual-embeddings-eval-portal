Istanbul shares firmed amid selective trade led by shares of largely state-owned bluechip firms on Monday , with the market index continuing this year &apos;s string of records , brokers said . 
the IMKB National-100 closed at an all-time high of 1,201 , up seven points , or 0.59 percent from Friday &apos;s previous record of 1,194 . 
but in dollar terms , it eased to 1.05 cents from Friday &apos;s 1.06-cent record as the lira weakened sharply against the dollar . 
daily trade volume fell to 19.26 trillion lira from Friday &apos;s 22.96 trillion . 
brokers said demand for shares of largely state-owned firms was boosted by renewed privatisation hopes in the afternoon following the completion of negotiations for the sell-off tender of public Etibank at midday . 
&quot; The market rose on state shares , namely ( flat steel maker ) Eregli in the afternoon amid positive privatisation expectations buoyed by related comments and the finalisation of the Etibank tender , &quot; said Mustafa Karaahmetoglu from Sayilgan securities . 
Eregli has a strong impact on the market index due to its large market capitalisation . 
State Minister Ufuk Soylemez said after the Etibank negotiations were completed that Turkey would reach its target of $ 5 billion in privatisation revenues this year if there were no legal obstacles to sell-offs . 
he said the privatisation body planned to open tenders for oil refiner Tupras and petroleum products marketer Petrol Ofisi in the first quarter after receiving bids for the partial block sale of a 51.66 percent state stake in Eregli by January 27 . 
Soylemez also said the 1997 target did not include $ 3.5 billion expected to be raised from the sale of Turk Telekom , the centrepiece of the government &apos;s ambitious 1997 sell-off programme aimed at reducing huge deficits . 
the stock market awaits a constitutional court ruling tomorrow on a law designed to enable Turk Telekom &apos;s sell-off . 
the market index has surged 23.05 percent , breaking 12 record closes since the beginning of 1997 . 
of the 239 shares traded , 106 declined , 71 advanced and 62 closed stable . 
top actives were Eregli which leapt 750 lira to 15,500 and Turkish Airlines which rose 1,000 lira to 27,500 . 
they made up 17.8 percent of the total turnover .
