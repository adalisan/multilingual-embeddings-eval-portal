the Philippines posted a balance of payments surplus of $ 450 million in the first four months of the year compared with $ 1.43 billion a year earlier , the Central Bank said on Wednesday . 
Central Bank research director Diwa Gunigundo said the lower surplus was brought on lower dollar inflows by the Central Bank during the period and payments of loans . 
in the past month , the Central Bank had to defend the peso against speculative attacks from the problems in the Thai baht by selling dollars , Gunigundo added .
