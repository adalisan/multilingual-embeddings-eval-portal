attorneys for Oklahoma City bombing defendant Timothy McVeigh said on Wednesday federal authorities quoted on television violated a judge &apos;s order prohibiting comments about evidence in the upcoming trial . 
the claim was made in a brief filed with the court and released to the public on Wednesday . 
it says comments by former prosecutors and others attributed to unidentified government sources on NBC &apos;s Dateline programme on Sept . 4 violated the order . 
the attorneys alleged the comments were an attempt to influence potential jurors to believe that McVeigh and co-defendant Terry Nichols were guilty . 
they are the only persons accused of the April 19 , 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building that claimed at least 168 lives . 
the trial was moved to Denver to better insure a fair hearing , but a trial date has not been set . 
McVeigh &apos;s lawyers used the allegation against authorities to bolster a defence request for the trial judge to permit McVeigh to grant eight news interviews &quot; to counter the false image that he is a demon . 
&quot; Mr. McVeigh should not be required simply to sit back while the government continues to &apos; produce &apos; television programmes which assume his guilt , &quot; the brief said . 
&quot; He must be allowed , within the guidelines of this court &apos;s order , to attempt to stop the perversive efforts of the prosecution to poison the prospective jury pool . 
trial Judge Richard Matsch has ordered authorities and defence laywers not to comment on potential evidence . 
he said comments of that type could interfere with a fair trial . 
Leesa Brown , a spokewoman for the prosecutors , said no current government employee who spoke to Dateline said anything that violated the judge &apos;s order . 
&quot; We &apos;re aware of what the protective order is and we &apos;re following its guidelines . 
the Dateline programme quoted persons that McVeigh attorney Amber McLaughlin called &quot; surrogate prosecutors &quot; about how &quot; John Doe II &quot; may never have existed and about the purported favourable quality of the prosecution &apos;s evidence . 
shortly after the bombing , authorities disseminated a sketch of John Doe II , an additional suspect who has never been arrested . 
McVeigh &apos;s lawyers have said someone other than McVeigh may be responsible for the bombing . 
separately , a coalition of news organisations objected to last week &apos;s filing of arguments by McVeigh and Nichols about why they should have separate trials being partially censored . 
the coalition asked Matsch to unseal the censored portions unless the defendants prove that sealing is justified .
