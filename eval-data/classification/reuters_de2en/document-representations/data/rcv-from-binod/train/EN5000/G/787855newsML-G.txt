violence escalated along the Israel-Lebanon border ahead of U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross &apos;s arrival on Saturday to try to break a crisis in Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking . 
Israeli planes unleashed rockets south of Beirut on Friday just hours after Katyusha rockets fired from Lebanon slammed into northern Israel . 
the United States condemned the cross border attacks and urged both sides to exercise &quot; maximum restraint &quot; in ending the violence in which 13 people have died since Monday . 
&quot; We &apos;ve been in contact with all the parties directly to urge maximum restraint , &quot; U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said in Washington . 
Ross returns to the region in an attempt to calm tensions after two suicide bombers killed 13 people and themselves in a Jerusalem market on July 30 . 
Israel has halted peace talks with the PLO in response to the bombings and sealed off the West Bank and Gaza , stopping trade , barring Palestinians from jobs in Israel and freezing financial transfers . 
Washington has said the latest American mediation mission will focus on Israeli insistence on enhanced security , which it has said is necessary for a resumption of peace talks . 
&quot; I think the main task now is to persuade the Palestinian Authority it must make what the prime minister ( Benjamin Netanyahu ) has termed a 180 degree turn in its attitude and actions against the terrorist organisations , &quot; Netanyahu &apos;s aide David Bar-Illan told Reuters . 
but Palestinian President Yasser Arafat , who has condemned the closure of the West Bank and Gaza as collective punishment , said security was just one of several issues that needed to be raised . 
&quot; Security cooperation is one of the things that should go along with the remaining essential issues agreed upon in the Oslo accords , &quot; Arafat told reporters after the weekly cabinet meeting in Ramallah . 
the Ross visit coincides with the flare-up on the border between Israel and Lebanon . 
Israelis along the northern border spent Friday night in bomb shelters . 
the Katyusha rocket attack , in which an Israeli woman was slightly wounded and a synagogue damaged , was the first to hit the town of Kiryat Shmona in more than 15 months since Israel and Hizbollah guerrillas undertook not to fire at civilians . 
the understanding was part of a 1996 cease-fire that ended a 17-day Israeli blitz in which about 200 people , mainly Lebanese civilians , were killed . 
Israel said on Friday its planes attacked targets in the Na &apos;ameh hills north of the 15 km ( nine mile ) buffer strip across southern Lebanon it controls with local allies . 
Lebanese sources said no one was hurt in the attack . 
since Monday , when Israeli commandos raided suspected Hizbollah targets in south Lebanon , the violence has claimed the lives of five Hizbollah guerrillas , seven civilians and a pro-Israeli militiaman . 
Hizbollah , which is fighting to drive Israeli troops from southern Lebanon , denied it launched Friday &apos;s Katyusha attack . 
but the group &apos;s chief , Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah , told a news conference in Beirut that Hizbollah would resume rocket attacks on northern Israel because the 1996 accord had failed to protect Lebanese civilians .
