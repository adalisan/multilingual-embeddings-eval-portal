innovative product development should assure manufacturing remains a driving force in Hong Kong &apos;s economy , assuming supportive trade and patent laws persist , according to a report released Monday . 
&quot; Made by Hong Kong , &quot; a Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) study of 350 firms involved in major Hong Kong industries , lists strengths of and challenges for Hong Kong as the July reversion to Chinese rule approaches . 
&quot; We discovered that Hong Kong industry has very great strengths ... but also real weaknesses , &quot; project co-leader Suzanne Berger , an MIT professor of political science , said in a presentation . 
production coordination and flexibility may be Hong Kong industry &apos;s foremost strengths , Berger said . 
manufacturers are able to switch product lines quickly , tailoring them to customer demand , she said . 
other strengths include strong managers , non-interventionist public institutions and a spirit of internationalism , Berger said . 
because Hong Kong industry relies heavily on technology , its core industrial capability can only be expanded if specific needs are addressed , said Richard Lester , project co-leader and director of MIT &apos;s Industrial Performance Center . 
perhaps most important , Hong Kong must maintain and strengthen its reputation as a &quot; safe harbor &quot; for proprietary information and ideas , Lester said . 
&quot; The question is how Hong Kong can enlarge its international reputation as a place in which investors and innovators find ... rigorous enforcement of laws on intellectual property , country-of-origin conventions and other trade laws , &quot; he said . 
the territory requires a &quot; cultural change in public opinion &quot; on those issues , Lester said . 
asked whether China could be expected to retain Hong Kong &apos;s &quot; safe harbor &quot; status , Berger told Reuters &quot; China has a big interest in having at least the status quo in Hong Kong . 
China would like to preserve Hong Kong &apos;s &quot; distinctiveness &quot; as one of the world &apos;s leading information technology developers and manufacturers , she said . 
other challenges for Hong Kong industry include developing a more-skilled workforce , increasing research and development spending and including technology-savvy officials in government decision making , according to a report released with the study .
