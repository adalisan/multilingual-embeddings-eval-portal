volatility edged down in robust volume as renewed optimism over European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) pushed the futures higher , they said . 
West said one brokerage bought 7,000 lots of 130.00 September puts , as the September futures contract jumped to a new high of 137.53 . 
austerity measures announced by the French government on Monday were seen injecting new fuel into EMU plays and giving Italy a greater chance of making it into the first round . 
by 1120 GMT , the futures were up 76 basis points at 137.32 , and the 130.00 puts had attracted volume of more than 7,600 lots . 
brokers said they did not know whether the broker had opened a new bearish position or the trade was in conjunction with some other strategy . 
Mourad Amellel , a trader at TransOptions Finance in London , said the broker may have sold the puts when the futures were lower and was now buying them back . 
&quot; In the future we broke all resistance and we are at the top of the market historically and in the options people are buying back puts , &quot; he said . 
in calls , traders said the 140.00 September strike was the most active , but volume at 1,830 lots was muted compared to the puts . 
there was also scattered volume between the 136.00 and 140.00 calls . 
traders quoted implied volatility of September options at around 6.75 percent , slightly down from Monday &apos;s levels . 
other months were virtually untraded . 
all eyes would now be on Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan who will present his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony at 1800 GMT . 
he was expected to say that the U.S. economy was thriving in a benign low-inflation environment but that the Fed must remain on guard against creeping price pressures .
