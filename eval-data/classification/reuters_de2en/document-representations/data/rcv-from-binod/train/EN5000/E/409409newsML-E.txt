following are analysts &apos; comments on a 0.2 percent rise in French fourth quarter gross domestic product announced on Thursday . 
the rise followed a revised 0.8 percent increase in the third quarter and gave full-year growth of 1.3 percent . 
economists polled by Reuters had forecast fourth-quarter growth as being flat . 
I think ( the figures ) are without surprise ... The effect of the end of the &quot; Juppette &quot; incentive to buy cars was rather substantial on domestic demand and household consumption . 
the big news now is how the first quarter is shaping up ... January household consumption was pretty weak excluding the rebound factor from the car scheme . 
although it is stronger than expected the downward revision to the third quarter evens it out . 
in terms of market impact , it &apos;s very hard for any piece of data , let alone backward looking data , to have much effect in the light of Greenspan yesterday . 
it is in line with the perception of a somewhat stronger trend ; it was not nearly as weak as many had thought it would be . 
there are clear signs of export-led growth , a classic style of recovery , and the early signs of recovery in the first quarter are fairly evident . 
generally what was expected .... We should now concentrate on the first quarter of this year . 
this quarter is looking better than the last quarter so far and I think the growth rate for this year that the authorities in France are projecting , around two and a quarter percent , is something which is attainable . 
they &apos;re good numbers , a bit stronger than consensus . 
one rather surprising thing is that it seems consumer spending declined by less than the spending on manufactured goods series suggested . 
it reflects better sentiment in the business sector . 
the figures set a nice basis , technically , for 1997 growth and this combined with the stronger spending we &apos;ve already seen , is supportive for first-half growth .
