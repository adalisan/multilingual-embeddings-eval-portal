Greek bonds were dragged down by market jitters stemming from the Athens bourse &apos;s fall , developments in neighbouring Albania and doubts about European high-yielders &apos; ability to make the EMU grade , dealers said . 
taxable FRNs and three-year coupon bonds came under selling pressure from foreign and domestic players with prices of floating rate notes shedding 30 to 40 basis points and coupon bonds 25 basis points . 
players were also liquidating long positions in tax-free securities but the impact on these FRNs and coupon bonds was milder with prices declining 10 to 20 basis points , dealers said . 
senior bankers said the free fall of the Athens bourse &apos;s benchmark index in the last three sessions and social unrest in neighbouring Albania were mainly responsible for the mild drop in bond prices on Monday . 
&quot; Some domestic mutual funds experiencing redemptions from shareholders chose to liquidate part of their bond portfolios pulling prices down , &quot; said a treasurer at a foreign bank . 
&quot; This is my best explanation given no changes in the interest rate outlook . 
the Athens stock exchange general index added losses of 7.45 percent on Monday , bringing cumulative losses to 17 percent for the last three sessions . 
the senior banker said developments in neighbouring Albania could have also contributed to the correction in the bond market by reminding foreign investors of the greater risk involved in emerging markets . 
&quot; The Albanian situation does not help Greek asset markets because it makes their risk / reward profile less attractive to foreign investors , &quot; he said . 
but other bankers said the link between the Greek bond market and Albania was very weak at best . 
&quot; Albania might be a neighbouring country but I find it hard to believe that it has anything to do with the deteriorating market sentiment in Greek markets , &quot; said a senior bond dealer at a private bank . 
&quot; The economic fundamentals have not changed here . 
the dealer said the outlook for lower inflation and interest rates both indispensable elements for a bull market in bonds , was intact . 
&quot; I cannot accept that three-year coupon bonds due 2000 trading around 101.35 about 10-days ago can now trade around par with no change in fundamentals . 
but others said profit-taking in Greek bonds reflected a move away from peripheral European high-yielders as well as countries suffering from high current account deficits such as South Africa and the Czech Republic . 
&quot; unwinding positions and reducing risk exposure in high yielders dominate market mood right now , &quot; said Petros Christodoulou , head of European short-term trading at J.P Morgan in London . 
&quot; Greek bonds fall in this category and we will see more profit-taking , &quot; he said . 
Greek FRNs offered a better value than three-year coupon bonds which had a negative carry for the next six months but both had factored in favourable developments in inflation in the next few months , he added . 
&quot; FRNs will become attractive again when discount margins get to around 90 to 100 basis points , &quot; he said . 
CPI-based inflation stood at 6.8 percent year-on-year in January and is expected to fall to about 6.5 percent in February . 
&quot; Greek interest rates have bottomed out for now , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I think we will see a less inverted yield curve in the near future . 
he shrugged off the argument that profit-taking in bonds was related to the Athens bourse &apos;s sharp fall and developments in Albania . 
others agreed saying that the bond market was regulated and dominated by professional players that paid close attention to fundamentals . 
&quot; This is a regulated market dominated by professional players , &quot; said a bond dealer at a foreign bank . 
&quot; By definition , this means that bond price movements will not be as exaggerated . 
dealers differed on whether the weakening of the drachma against the ecu related to weakness in stocks or fixed income developments . 
&quot; The rise of ecu / drachma above the 305 level today relates directly to sales of shares by foreign investors at the bourse , &quot; said the treasurer of the foreign bank . 
&quot; If the selling goes on , we might see ecu / drachma above the 306 mark in the next few days . 
but Christodoulou attributed the strength of the ecu vis-a-vis the drachma today to profit-taking in the fixed-income market . 
&quot; Bond selling by foreign investors is reflected on the spot forex market , &quot; he said . 
&quot; That is what we experienced today . 
ECU / drachma was trading around 305.45 / 60 in late dealing .
