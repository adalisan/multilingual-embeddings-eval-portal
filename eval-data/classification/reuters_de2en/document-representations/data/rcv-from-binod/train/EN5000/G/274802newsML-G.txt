the Cuban Foreign Ministry confirmed on Monday it expelled the correspondent in Havana for the Russian news agency Itar TASS , saying he was &quot; directly involved in illegal activities related to gambling . 
a ministry spokesman , Miguel Alfonso , said that Konstantin Zhukovski , 37 , was ordered to leave the country after it was established he was linked with organising and promoting betting games , which are illegal in Cuba . 
Alfonso , quoted by the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina , said the journalist had signed a statement acknowledging this . 
Zhuvovski had said his actions were part of journalistic research , Alfonso said , adding this could not be a justification . 
Konstantin was detained in Havana at a private house on Thursday night and put on a flight to Moscow on Saturday . 
gambling was outlawed in Cuba after the 1959 revolution which brought President Fidel Castro to power . 
illegal betting occurs , and Cubans convicted of gambling offences face jail sentences of up to four years .
