Australia on Friday refused to grant an entry visa to Gerry Adams , leader of Sinn Fein , the political wing of the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) , on the grounds that he failed to meet the good character requirements of the Migration Act . 
the government also refused to grant a visa to controversial British historian David Irving on the same grounds . 
&quot; Mr Adams continues to be intimately associated with the Provisional Irish Republican Army , known as the P.I.R.A. , &quot; Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said . 
&quot; The P.I.R.A. 
is an organisation that continues to conduct criminal acts of terrorism and bombing , &quot; he said in a statement . 
&quot; On this basis , I have refused Mr Adams &apos; application , &quot; he said . 
Adams had sought a visa to visit Australia later this month to promote his autobiography . 
Adams has never visited Australia . 
the Australian government has a long-standing policy on visa applications by Sinn Fein leaders , which must meet strict conditions . 
the Australian government has been concerned that Adams did not condemned the IRA &apos;s resumption of violence after the February 9 ceasefire breakdown . 
the IRA ended the 17-month truce by attacking British targets in Britain and Germany , then struck in Northern Ireland last month with an attack on Britain &apos;s army headquarters . 
Britain and Ireland , partners in an attempt to forge a lasting political settlement to 27 years of Northern Ireland conflict , say Sinn Fein cannot be invited to peace talks until there is a new IRA truce . 
Ruddock also used the good character requirements of the Migration Act in refusing Irving &apos;s application . 
after outlining aspects of Irving &apos;s past that he said were a matter of concern , Ruddock said : &quot; taken together they reveal a consistent pattern of behaviour that led me to conclude that Mr Irving is not a person of good character . 
Irving , who has argued that Hitler did not order the extermination of Jews in the World War Two , was barred from entering Australia in 1992 .
