Kenya &apos;s President Daniel arap Moi is hosting exploratory peace talks in Nairobi between rival Somali faction leaders , diplomats said on Thursday . 
they said major Mogadishu rivals Hussein Aideed and Ali Mahdi Mohamed arrived in Nairobi this week for the discussions but the two men had not met face-to-face . 
&quot; I understand they are staggered exploratory talks hosted by President Moi . 
Aideed and Ali Mahdi are here and others will arrive to see if they can agree on a wider meeting , &quot; a diplomat told Reuters . 
&quot; They are at a very early stage but they are much better than nothing and might just lead somewhere , &quot; the source added . 
the sources said the meetings led on from Moi &apos;s intervention to secure the release on October 3 of an Australian pilot held in a jail in the southwestern Somali town of Baidoa for 131 days . 
in a move that surprised many Western diplomats in Nairobi , Moi stepped in and personally urged Aideed to free 24-year-old Justin Frazer , who had been sentenced to 25 years in jail for landing his plane in Somalia without clearance in May . 
Aideed , a 34-year-old former U.S. marine who took over from his father Mohamed Farah Aideed following his death in Mogadishu on August 1 , accepted Moi &apos;s call and Frazer was flown to Kenya . 
Aideed , like his father , was elected president of Somalia by supporters and heads a government . 
but it has not received much international recognition and is rejected by Ali Mahdi and other leaders . 
the death of Mohamed Farah Aideed prompted widespread hopes in Mogadishu of a possible negotiated end to Somalia &apos;s civil war which began with the fall of late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991 . 
but south Mogadishu has been hit in the past several weeks by a series of assassinations which Somali experts say are part of a vendetta between factions to avenge Mohamed Farah Aideed &apos;s killing . 
Moi has been closely involved in several earlier diplomatic initiatives to build peace in Somalia , including a face-to-face reconciliation meeting in Nairobi between Ali Mahdi and Mohamed Farah Aideed in 1994 , but they all failed to stop the fighting . 
an official with Ali Mahdi said the north Mogadishu alliance leader was holding talks with members of another Somali faction in his room at a Nairobi hotel on Thursday . 
he declined to give details . 
an employee at the Nairobi home of Ali Hassan Osman Atto , said the faction leader would arrive in Kenya later on Thursday . 
the recent killings in Mogadishu have been mainly between supporters of Hussein Aideed and Osman Atto , a former financier and right hand man of Mohamed Farah Aideed who broke with him last year . 
Hussein Aideed says his 62-year-old father died of a heart attack . 
but his aides initially said he died from wounds when he was shot on a frontline in southern Mogadishu and many Somalis believe the fatal shots came from territory held by Osman Atto .
