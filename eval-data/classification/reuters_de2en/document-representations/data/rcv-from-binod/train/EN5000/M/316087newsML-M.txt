Australian bond spreads finished narrower on Friday , despite a lacklustre performance by the local market . 
a flat to slightly positive close in the local market saw it outperform U.S. and Canadian markets , both of which weakened on Thursday . 
with New Zealand bonds selling off on higher than expected CPI data , the scene was set for an across the board spread narrowing without too much effort from the local market , traders said . 
the curve contiuned its flattening trend of the second half of the week , although it still closed above 100 points . 
traders said it may take renewed concerns that a local easing was out of the question before it moved conclusively back under 100 points . 
at the moment , market sentiment was that a rate cut was still on the cards , but probably not in February following some signs of strength in Thursday &apos;s labour force data . 
over the week spreads to all bonds , except Canadian three years , narrowed . 
against U.S. bonds , the spread to three years improved by 14 points , while the long bond spread narrowed by 10 points . 
the yield curves ended slightly steeper over the week , despite flattening for the last three days . 
the futures curve was 2.5 points steeper over the week , while the cash curve added a point .
