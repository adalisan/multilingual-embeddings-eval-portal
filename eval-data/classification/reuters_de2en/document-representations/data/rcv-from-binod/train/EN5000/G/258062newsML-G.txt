Sandra Voelker and Johanna Sjoberg enjoyed a lucrative record-breaking weekend at the inaugural European sprints and short-course swimming championships . 
European swimming &apos;s governing body Len offered prize money for the first time at one of its championships and officials believe this could be the way to raise the profile of the sport . 
the money -- 5,000 marks ( $ 3,420 ) for a European record -- was relatively modest in comparison with the vast financial rewards offered in golf and tennis but was none the less welcome . 
&quot; The prize money for records is a special incentive . 
the shops should be pleased because I haven &apos;t bought any Christmas presents yet , &quot; Voelker joked after setting her second European mark . 
Voelker does promotional work for the sportswear company which sponsored these four-day championships , though her earnings do not match the millions garnered from endorsements by her high-profile German rival Franziska van Almsick . 
Voelker , who gained three medals at the Atlanta Olympics , is a full-time swimmer . 
her coach , Dirk Lange , said : &quot; There are only a few swimmers , like Sandra , who can live from the sport . 
I think swimming will go in a similar direction to athletics . 
Voelker , 22 , shattered the absent van Almsick &apos;s European 100 metres freestyle short-course record and then bettered the mark the two of them shared for the 50 freestyle . 
she also anchored Germany to a world best time in the women &apos;s 4x50 medley relay -- her second relay gold -- and triumphed in the 50 backstroke , an event she won in all four editions of the old European sprint championships . 
Sjoberg , an 18-year-old Swede , restricted Voelker to five golds by beating the German in the 50 and 100 metres butterfly and setting two European records in the process . 
Germany topped the medals table with 14 golds , followed by Britain who collected four golds thanks to Mark Foster ( 50 butterfly and 50 freestyle ) and Susan Rolph ( 100 and 200 individual medley ) . 
despite the absence of Alexander Popov , Michelle Smith and all Europe &apos;s other Olympic gold medallists , 1996 world best times were achieved in 19 of the 38 events . 
the championships , postponed from last April because the Neptun pool leaked , took their place in an extremely crowded calendar . 
the World Cup series , embracing two Asian and six European venues , unfolds in January and February with $ 170,000 on offer in prize money and world records worth $ 2,000 . 
the world short-course championships take place in Gothenburg in April , followed by the European long-course championships in Seville in August and the world long-course championships in Perth in January 1998 . 
German men &apos;s team coach Manfred Thiesmann believes high training levels and a succession of championship peaks are compatible . 
&quot; If we want to stay interesting we cannot keep our noses under water the whole time training , &quot; he said . 
but the World Cup series could suffer . 
&quot; The leading ( German ) swimmers will take a limited part in the World Cup . 
the top ones will just compete in Gelsenkirchen ( the German venue ) , &quot; German women &apos;s team coach Achim Jedamsky said . 
Voelker , like Foster , will spend three weeks in Australia next month . 
&quot; I &apos;ll prepare in Perth for the world short-course championships and at the same time collect my first impressions for the world ( long-course ) championships there , &quot; she said .
