Hong Kong stocks ended Tuesday &apos;s session with only modest gains , as the morning &apos;s rally ran out of steam and investors reacted to Morgan Stanley &apos;s weighting cut for the Hong Kong market , analyst said . 
the Hang Seng index closed 11.02 points higher at 11,223.62 after rising to 11,334.40 earlier in the session . 
&quot; I guess we have just run into levels where the market could not muster any more strength , &quot; said Glenn Lesko , head of sales trading at HG Asia . 
brokers said share prices had begun to fade during the afternoon as players discussed last Thursday &apos;s reweighting by Morgan Stanley of the Hong Kong and Thai markets . 
&quot; People were talking about it , &quot; said Lesko . 
Morgan Stanley said due to concerns about a rise in U.S. interest rates , regional strategist Peter Churchouse had increased the cash weighting in his model portfolio to 15 percent from 10 . 
Hong Kong &apos;s weighting dropped to 20.5 percent from 23.0 and Thailand &apos;s was cut to 6.5 percent from 9.0 . 
futures selling weighed on the market with September Hang Seng futures ending down 45 points at 11,170 . 
&quot; The concentration is very much on quality , &quot; said Robin Hammond , Hong Kong research director at Asia Equity . 
&quot; Selective ( property ) developers are still leading the way . 
Hammond said the market had overreacted at the start of trade to overnight gains on Wall Street . 
the Hang Seng notched up a 121.80 point gain in early trade after rising 187.01 points on Monday . 
the Dow industrials rose 73.98 points to 5,733.84 . 
analysts said the invitation to Hong Kong to join the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) had not affected trading . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think as an isolated event it would have much impact . 
it just means higher profile as a financial hub , &quot; said Andrew Fernow , director of research at Vickers Ballas . 
Wharf shares were unmoved by news that companies involved in Hong Kong &apos;s long delayed Container Terminal Number Nine project have agreed on a proposal which will be submitted to China for approval .
