coconut oil prices are likely to continue falling this week due to rising copra output and the abundance of substitutes such as palm and soyoil , Manila vegetable oil traders said on Monday . 
&quot; Crushers from the Philippines and Indonesia are aggressively selling down the market , &quot; said a senior Manila trader . 
traders saw prices shedding between $ 5 and $ 10 per tonne this week . 
last week , the market lost $ 20 , with prices hitting $ 600 per tonne fob . 
&quot; expect a technical rebound when the price pierces $ 580 per tonne , &quot; said a trader at one of the country &apos;s largest coconut oil mills . 
traders said coconut oil prices had dropped between $ 100 and $ 110 per tonne since the start of the year as supplies of lauric oils in Malaysia and Indonesia increased . 
poor demand for coconut oil in Europe and the U.S. was expected to keep prices at low levels . 
coconut oil stocks in Rotterdam increased to 20,100 tonnes as of May 12 from the previous week &apos;s 17,429 .
