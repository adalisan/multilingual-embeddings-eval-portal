Chicago Board of Trade members on Tuesday approved a proposal to change the corn and soybean delivery system by a vote of 423-2 / 6 to 211-2 / 6 , the exchange said . 
the proposal sets delivery locations along the Illinois River from Pekin , Ill . , to Chicago . 
it also allows for delivery at Burns Harbor , Ind . , but eliminates delivery points at Toledo and St. Louis . 
the plan also requires that delivery be made through a shipping certificate instead of a warehouse receipt . 
a shipping certificate proves the firm making delivery can get the proper amount of grain to a delivery location , while a warehouse receipt confirms the grain is already in an approved warehouse . 
&quot; The plan approved overwhelmingly by our membership will benefit the grain industry as a whole and reinforce the viability of the CBOT agricultural contracts well into the next century , &quot; CBOT chairman Pat Arbor said in a statement . 
&quot; While I respect the many views and opinions the membership had on this issue , I am confident the plan approved was the best solution available , &quot; Arbor said . 
the changes come after the commodity futures Trading Commission in December told the exchange that the delivery terms for its corn and soybean contracts were no longer suitable due to shrinking Chicago storage space and changes in cash grain marketing . 
CFTC had said it would make its own recommendations if the exchange failed to come up with a solution . 
pending CFTC approval , the new terms will be implemented beginning with the January 1999 soybean contract and March 1999 corn contract .
