U.S. industrial production strengthened in November after declining in October , spurred by inventory building , especially in the auto sector , economists said . 
&quot; We expect industrial production to be up 0.5 percent or 0.6 percent after a pretty sharp October drop of 0.5 percent , &quot; said Joshua Feinman , vice president and global markets economist at Bankers Trust . 
Feinman said &quot; the big swing factor &quot; for the industrial production data in November was auto production . 
Auto production was down sharply in October due to the effects of a strike against General Motors by Canadian autoworkers . 
after the strike was settled , production rebounded . 
&quot; There &apos;s been a rebound in auto and truck assemblies after a sharp decline due to the strike against GM in Canada and some weaker production by Ford and Chrysler , as well , &quot; said Sally Kleinman , vice president and senior domestic economist at Chase Securities Inc . 
Kleinman is forecasting a 0.6 percent rise in November industrial production . 
besides the jump in manufacturing production , which accounts for about 85 percent of the industrial production figure , Kleinman sees a jump in utility output and an offsetting decline in mining production . 
mining accounts for less than seven percent of the total output measured by the Federal Reserve &apos;s industrial production report . 
utility output accounts for a little less than eight percent , said Kleinman . 
the higher utility output could be related to winter weather . 
it is also partly due to busier manufacturing activity . 
&quot; When manufacturing plants are running , they need power , &quot; said Kleinman . 
ram Bhagavatula , chief economist at Citicorp Global Finance , looks for a slightly more tempered industrial production rise of 0.4 percent for November . 
&quot; Some inventory building is going on in the economy so that &apos;s putting some upward presure on production , &quot; he said . 
the financial markets need not be concerned about this level of industrial production because it contains no inflation threat , the economists said . 
they look for the portion of the nation &apos;s mines , utilities and factories employed in the month &apos;s industrial output to rise to about 83 percent from 82.7 percent in October . 
&quot; That &apos;s still below where we were running in September when it was 83.4 and we &apos;re not back to the levels that would probably put upward pressure on commodity prices -- which would be between 84 and 85 , &quot; said Kleinman . 
&quot; After smoothing out the gyrations , you see a manufacturing sector that &apos;s advancing at only a fairly moderate rate , &quot; said Feinman . 
&quot; Consequently , it is not putting increasing strains on production or , ultimately , prices . 
&quot; We &apos;re so far from any inflation thresholds ... there &apos;s no concern about that , &quot; said Bhagavatula .
