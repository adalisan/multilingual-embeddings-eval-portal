Tjiu Mau-ying , chairman of Taiwan &apos;s Council of Agriculture , offered to resign on Thursday , becoming the third cabinet member to tender his resignation , state television reported . 
&quot; Tjiu Mau-ying has told vice premier Hsu Li-teh this evening that he would resign , &quot; state television said . 
Tjiu has been under fire since March for his council &apos;s failure to prevent the outbreak of a deadly hog epidemic that forced Taiwan to launch an all-out ban on pork exports , jeopardising the island &apos;s economic recovery . 
his resignation followed that of Ma Ying-jeou , minister without portfolio , and Interior Minister Lin Feng-cheng on the same day . 
their resignations came at a time of growing public fury over the government &apos;s handling of a series of violent crimes that have hit Taiwan since 1996 . 
the anger intensified after police on April 28 discovered the body of renowned actress Pai Ping-ping &apos;s teenage daughter floating naked in a river on April 28 . 
more than 50,000 people marched in Taipei on Sunday to protest against Pai &apos;s murder and demand a cabinet reshuffle .
