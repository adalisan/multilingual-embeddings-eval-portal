President Boris Yeltsin started a two-day break in the picturesque lakeland of Valdai in northwestern Russia on Tuesday , the presidential press service said , denying rumours that the Kremlin leader was ill . 
a spokesman said Yeltsin would size up prospects for a longer vacation in Valdai . 
&quot; It is expected that Boris Yeltsin will return to Moscow this week where he will hold a series of meetings with members of the government , &quot; he said . 
Valdai , in the Novgorod region about 350 km ( 220 miles ) northwest of Moscow , has been mentioned by Kremlin aides as a possible holiday destination for the 65-year-old leader . 
Itar-Tass news agency quoted presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying the statement on Yeltsin &apos;s departure had been issued &quot; in connection with the usual guesses and suppositions about the president &apos;s whereabouts &quot; . 
he dismissed as &quot; complete rubbish &quot; a report by Ekho Moskvy radio that Yeltsin had been in a specialist cardiological centre since August 15 . 
Ekho Moskvy quoted informed sources as saying that doctors at the centre , named after heart specialist Yevgeny Chazov , had diagnosed the president &apos;s condition as of average seriousness . 
&quot; In the coming hours the question of carrying out a surgical operation may be decided , &quot; the radio said . 
however , it also quoted the acting head doctor at the centre as saying Yeltsin was not there . 
&quot; You can come and see for yourself , &quot; the doctor said . 
Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin were continuing to work on the formation of the new Russian government , most of which was announced last week . 
Yeltsin suffered two heart attacks last year and his disappearance from the public eye in late June triggered rumours about his health . 
Yeltsin has made only one public appearance since June 26 , briefly turning up at his inauguration ceremony on August 9 . 
aides say he suffered &quot; colossal weariness &quot; after his reelection campaign , but they deny he has suffered new heart trouble . 
Yastrzhembsky on Monday denied a report by the U.S. magazine Time which said Yeltsin had suffered from heart problems again in the second half of June . 
time said that , according to an official Kremlin medical advisory it had obtained , the president needed round-the-clock monitoring and the Kremlin was considering transferring him to a Swiss clinic for a bypass operation . 
&quot; This information is part of a series of rumours and conjectures concerning the state of the president &apos;s health , &quot; Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing . 
he said the president , whom he had met recently , had been doing paperwork every day at a residence near Moscow . 
Yeltsin , who frequently spends vacations at the Black Sea resort of Sochi , had been expected to start a holiday outside Moscow after his inauguration . 
the Valdai area , a mixture of thick woods and hundreds of lakes where Russia &apos;s River Volga originates , is a long-time resort area popular for its mild climate and beautiful nature .
