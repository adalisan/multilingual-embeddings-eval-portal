fresh buying and short-covering by the funds lifted CSCE world sugar futures sharply higher and over nearby resistance seen at 10.89 cents in March , dealers said . 
the trade stood on the opposite side of the market led by the producers , who were cited as steady scale-up sellers . 
one dealer said between 300 to 500 lots were probably sold from 10.84 at each tick higher . 
&quot; What it came to is steady fund buying , which gradually eroded scale-up selling , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It was like a diagonal line : a very steady ascent reaching 10.90 on close . 
the most-active March contract finished on resistance at 10.89 , up 0.16 , traded 10.90 to 10.73 . 
the back months settled 0.16 to 0.11 firmer . 
volume was estimated at 20,856 lots , which included 966 against actuals in March . 
floor sources said today &apos;s close could signal firmer prices ahead of New Year &apos;s holiday . 
but the trade will probably remain a steady seller into rallies , providing an obstacle to firm resistance pegged between 11.00 and 11.05 cents . 
&quot; With a good crop forecast , there is more selling they can do . 
support was pegged between 10.65 and 10.60 in March .
