U.S. Midcontinent spot product prices for November barrels sank on higher distillate supplies and news rival Kurdish groups extended a U.S-brokered ceasefire , which renewed hopes of U.S. imports of Iraqi crude . 
fears of heating oil shortages this winter have evaporated after two-straight weeks of supply builds . 
American Petroleum Institute on Thursday reported Midwest distillate inventories rose a net 390,000 barrels in the region for the week ended October 25 , leaving stocks 3.98 million barrels above the prior week &apos;s levels . 
nationally , distillate stocks , which include heating oil , climbed 3.6 million barrels last week to 11.8 million , API data showed . 
the market also turned bearish on the easing of Middle East tensions , brokers said . 
&quot; That sets up a speculative mood that we &apos;ll see Iraqi oil sales , &quot; in early 1997 , a trader said . 
NYMEX heating oil for December delivery fell 2.01 cents a gallon to 66.85 cents , while unleaded gasoline futures dipped 2.32 cents to 64.61 cents . 
late differentials for low sulphur diesel firmed 0.50 cent in Group Three and Chicago low sulphur diesel late Thursday , outright prices for prompt low sulphur ranged 69.85 / 70.10 cents a gallon late . 
Diffs for conventional unleaded prompt barrels in the Group fell 0.25 from Wednesday , topping December futures by 3.50 cents . 
traders talked the grade 67.61 / 67.86 cents . 
Diffs for premium grade in Group Three and Midco were steady to 0.25 lower late . 
overall , liquidity dried up late , as traders were sidelined by the steep drop in futures and yesterday &apos;s high gasoline prices . 
&quot; I think everyone was shellshocked yesterday in the wet prices for the Gulf , &quot; a trader said .
