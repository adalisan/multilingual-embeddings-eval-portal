Qatar on Sunday said it would not withdraw a case it had taken to the International Court of Justice over a territorial dispute with neighbouring Bahrain . 
&quot; It is inconceivable that we withdraw the case , &quot; Qatar &apos;s Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani told reporters in the Saudi capital Riyadh . 
he was speaking at the end of a Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) foreign and finance ministers meeting . 
but Sheikh Hamad said his country welcomed efforts by Saudi Arabia to settle the dispute . 
&quot; We think that the brothers in the Kingdom ( Saudi Arabia ) are exerting efforts and we believe we will see results , &quot; he said . 
Bahrain &apos;s Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammad bin Mubarak al-Khalifa refused to comment . 
Qatar and Bahrain are locked in a dispute over a number of barren islands , sandbanks and reefs which Bahrain has controlled since the 1930s . 
the areas may contain oil and gas reserves and are considered by both countries to be of strategic value . 
Bahrain has repeatedly asked Qatar to withdraw the case from the court at The Hague and accept Saudi mediation . 
but Qatar , a small peninsula on Saudi Arabia &apos;s eastern Gulf coast , says it would only withdraw the case if Saudi Arabia &apos;s mediation succeeded . 
Doha unilaterally asked the World Court in 1991 to settle the dispute . 
the court decided in January it had jurisdiction in the case and is expected to pronounce a verdict by the end of this year . 
Sheikh Hamad said he hoped the dispute would not keep Bahrain from attending the GCC &apos;s annual summit due to be hosted by Qatar in December . 
the GCC is a regional political , military and economic bloc which groups Qatar , Bahrain , Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , Oman and Kuwait .
