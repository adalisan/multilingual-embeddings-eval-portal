Afghanistan &apos;s Taleban Islamic militia captured the stronghold of former government military chief Ahmad Shah Masood on Monday and punched east into the strategic Panjsher valley . 
Taleban commanders and aid workers said Taleban fighters stormed into Jabal os-Siraj , 70 km ( 45 miles ) north of the Afghan capital Kabul , just after midnight following a three-hour battle . 
inside the town , Taleban fighters shot a commander of former prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar &apos;s Hezb-i-Islami faction identified as Karim Karabagh , aid workeres reported . 
Taleban forces then headed towards Golbahar 10 km ( six miles ) east of Jabal os-Siraj at the foot of the Panjsher valley , where Masood held off Soviet forces during their occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s . 
&quot; Fighting is going on in Golbahar now , &quot; said Mohammad Gul , deputy Taleban commander of a military barracks near Kabul . 
&quot; Most of Golbahar is under the control of the Taleban . 
he said the Taleban , which took Kabul early on Friday without much opposition after Masood &apos;s forces withdrew , said the militia planned to seize all the territory held by the former government of president Burhanuddin Rabbani . 
&quot; We intend to capture all the former government areas , including the Salang tunnel and the Panjsher , &quot; he said . 
the latest Taleban advance followed the capture on Sunday of the lightly defended town of Charikar , about 10 km ( six miles ) north of the previous frontline at Bagram . 
&quot; It took us 10 minutes to take Charikar , &quot; said Gul . 
&quot; One of our fighters was killed and six were wounded . 
Gul said the Taleban had made no decision to fight militia chief General Abdul Rashid Dostum , who holds six northern provinces , but plans to negotiate with him after mopping up any resistance from the former government . 
aid workers said Dostum had moved armoured columns in the last few days up to the northern end of the Soviet-built Salang tunnel , which crosses the formidable Hindu Kush mountain range . 
they said Masood &apos;s commander in charge of the Salang sector , General Basir , had fled to territory held by Dostum after the fall of Jabal os-Siraj . 
the Taleban , who recruited from Afghan refugees at religious schools in Pakistan , now control about three-quarters of Afghanistan , but military matters were not the sole preoccupation of the Sunni Moslem clerics . 
after taking Kabul , they quickly set up an interim ruling council vowing to turn Afghanistan into an Islamic state . 
religious leaders of the Taleban sought to harden their hardline grip by requiring men to grow long beards and banning women from workplaces . 
witnesses said at least four women were beaten in public by Taleban fighters wielding long chains in three separate incidents on Sunday for violating Islamic dress codes . 
the Taleban &apos;s fundamentalist decrees were announced by Kabul Radio hours after the special U.N. envoy to Afghanistan , Norbert Holl , said he saw hopeful signs in talks with the Islamist rulers on such issues as women &apos;s work outside the home . 
Taleban had earlier ordered women not to leave their homes without the &quot; hejab &quot; veil or to work in offices . 
its latest order said all men employed in government offices and in the military would face Islamic punishment unless they grew beards within the next month and a half . 
it did not specify what penalties would be imposed under Islamic Sharia law on any violators . 
it said workers would not be allowed to have short beards , but did not say how long a beard should be . 
punishments for women seen violating the dress codes were harsh and instantaneous . 
aid workers said one woman was beaten opposite the Jumhuriyet hospital in Kabul on Sunday as her small son watched in tears . 
two other women were beaten near the Pul-i-Khishti mosque in central Kabul and a fourth in the Taye-maskan area . 
&quot; This is terrible for us . 
it is as important as the occupation of Kabul , &quot; said a medical worker who asked not to be identified . 
UN envoy Holl told a news conference in Kabul he had held a two-hour meeting with Taleban &apos;s interim shura , or council , and discussed human rights and the role of women . 
the United Nations , which employs many women in its programmes in Afghanistan , has already suspended educational activities in areas previously captured by Taleban .
