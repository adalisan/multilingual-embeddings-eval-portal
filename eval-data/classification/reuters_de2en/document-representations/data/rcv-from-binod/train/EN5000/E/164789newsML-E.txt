a high-level official at the national economy ministry told Reuters the government was moving in favour of not taxing outstanding FRNs after the imposition of a new withholding tax on interest income from treasuries . 
&quot; The prevailing view at this point is to reset FRN coupons using the gross yield on 12-month T-bills , &quot; he said . 
&quot; In any case , the impact on rates from the withholding tax will be small and yields will still be attractive . 
isn &apos;t this what the investors want ? 
the local press reported that the government would levy an eight percent withholding tax on interest income from state securities . 
&quot; Securities issued in 1996 will not be taxed anyway , &quot; he said .
