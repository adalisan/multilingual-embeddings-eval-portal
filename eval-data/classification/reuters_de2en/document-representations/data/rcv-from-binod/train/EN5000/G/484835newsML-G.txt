the German government summoned Turkey &apos;s ambassador on Thursday to protest at criticism from Ankara over a spate of fires in which Turks have been killed or injured . 
&quot; It is astonishing and disappointing that , just after the successful visit of Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to Turkey , Ankara brings a tone into the discussion which could damage relations that are so important for both countries , &quot; state secretary Hans Friedrich von Ploetz told the ambassador . 
officials earlier virtually ruled out racist motives for an arson attack in the western town of Krefeld on Monday in which three Turks died . 
Turkey &apos;s Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan blamed the attack , together with a suspected racist firebombing in the Netherlands in which six Turks died , on rising anti-Moslem sentiment in the West . 
Germany is particularly sensitive to such accusations after working hard to combat racism following an upsurge of anti-foreigner attacks after unification in 1990 . 
more than 30 people died in the violence , among them five Turkish women and children in the worst attack , in Solingen in 1993 . 
&quot; It is not acceptable that Turkish officials take part in pre-judgement , unsubstantiated blame and insinuations and attack the federal government , Germany and even implicitly the chancellor , &quot; state secretary Hans Friedrich von Ploetz told ambassador Volkan Vural . 
Turkey &apos;s relations with Western Europe have become strained by its fears that it is not welcome to join the European Union . 
Kinkel told Turkey last week it still had a place in the European family but human rights problems , economic troubles , a Kurdish rebellion and quarrels with EU member Greece were serious obstacles to eventual Turkish membership in the EU . 
earlier on Thursday , North Rhine-Westphalia Interior Minister Franz Josef Kniola said a racist motive for the Krefeld blaze could &quot; almost be ruled out &quot; . 
Kniola said the combustible materials which started the fire were found mostly behind the closed door of the apartment , suggesting the attack was not racially motivated . 
von Ploetz said police were doing their utmost to clarify the circumstances of the attack , and assured Turks they were welcome in Germany . 
numerous fires in foreigners &apos; homes in Germany have initially been pinned on right-wing extremists , but turned out to be accidents , insurance fraud or the result of feuds among Turkish groups or between Turks and Kurds . 
on Tuesday , police found a Nazi swastika symbol spray-painted on a building in the town of Haigerseelbach after the house caught fire , injuring its Turkish occupant .
