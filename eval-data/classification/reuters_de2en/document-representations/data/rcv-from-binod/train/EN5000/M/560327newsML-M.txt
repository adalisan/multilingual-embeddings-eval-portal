U.S. stocks staged a blistering rally on Monday , sending the Dow industrials to an all-time closing high , its first in nearly two months . 
the Dow surged 143 points or two percent to 7214 , with virtually all the gains coming in a furious , program-dominated final two hours of the session . 
the rally stands as the fourth largest in point terms in the blue chip average &apos;s history . 
&quot; It was almost like a tidal wave coming , &quot; said Dick Stein , vice president at U.S. Clearing Corp. &quot; You certainly don &apos;t try to fight this kind of a move . 
the broad-based advance swept along large and small cap stocks alike . 
the S &amp; P 500 index gained 17 points to an all-time record 830 and the Nasdaq composite soared 34 points , a one-day gain second only to its 34.83 point burst last Friday . 
the Russell 2000 small cap index jumped 2.4 percent . 
analysts said many of the factors that fueled Friday &apos;s gains were clearly still at play today . 
one is mounting expectation that a capital gains tax cut will be enacted in the near future , a possibility that analysts said has investors hesistant to sell into the rally . 
&quot; We have a sellers &apos; strike going on here , &quot; said David Shulman , chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers . 
&quot; People are waiting to see what the effect will be of the capital gains tax cut . 
if you have a gain , why sell ? 
investors are also displaying renewed confidence as evidence accumulates that inflation remained in check despite booming first quarter U.S. economic growth . 
that has fueled expectations that any further monetary tightenings by the Federal Reserve will be limited in scope and easily digested by the market . 
&quot; The market is saying it expects Fed action will be extremely limited and it &apos;s saying it doesn &apos;t care if the Fed raises rates one more time , &quot; said Scott Bleier , chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd . 
whatever the reason behind the session &apos;s surge , program trades were clearly the vehicle by which the gains were accomplished . 
market research firm Birinyi Associates tracked a total of seven programs on the day , six of them buy programs . 
in all , the firm , said programs accounted for more than 157 points in Dow gains . 
the result was a rally of such dizzying speed that eventually , it appeared to feed on itself , said analysts . 
&quot; This was a classic case of panic buying , &quot; Bleier said . 
&quot; These moves are fast , furious and totally compressed and money managers who are not fully invested are chasing this market . 
tobacco stocks helped fuel the late burst , lifted by news that a Florida jury ruled in favor of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co in a wrongful death lawsuit . 
shares in Reynolds &apos; parent company RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp jumped 3-1 / 8 to 32-5 / 8 , reversing early losses .

in individual issues , Logicon Inc leapt 9-3 / 8 to 49-3 / 4 after reaching an agreement to be acquired by Northrop Grumman Corp for $ 52 per share in stock . 
Northrop Grumman fell 2-1 / 2 to 84-1 / 2 . 
railroad company Florida East Coast Industries Inc surged 19-1 / 8 to 107-7 / 8 after St. Joe Corp offered $ 102 per share in cash for the 46 percent of Florida East it does not already own . 
St. Joe shares also gained , rising 8-1 / 2 to 81-3 / 4 . 
Novellus Systems Inc soared 9-3 / 8 to 78-3 / 4 after announcing it would pay $ 80 million to settle all its patent litigation with applied Materials Inc .
