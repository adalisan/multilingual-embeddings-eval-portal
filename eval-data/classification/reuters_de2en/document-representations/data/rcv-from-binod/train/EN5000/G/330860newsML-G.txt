President Clinton attended at least 71 of more than 100 political &quot; kaffeeklatsches &quot; held at the White House during his re-election campaign , documents made public by the White House showed Friday . 
the extent of Clinton &apos;s involvement , and the identities of others involved , seemed likely to raise new questions about the intersection of money and access to power at the heart of the ongoing Clinton campaign financing controversy . 
the kaffeeklatsches , or coffee meetings , stretched over a 22-month period and brought Clinton together with business , ethnic and religious leaders , community activists and politicians -- many of whom were important campaign contributors . 
they were &quot; essentially for the purpose of developing and sustaining support for the president and his policies during the election year , &quot; said Lanny Davis , a White House special counsel dealing with the campaign financing uproar . 
a list of the gatherings was released along with a thick stack of documents detailing Clinton campaign plans to win votes and African , Asian , Jewish and disabled Americans . 
the documents were made public in advance of confirmation hearings for Labour Secretary-designate Alexis Herman , former director of the White House Office of Public Liaison ( OPL ) . 
Davis said the documents showed a clear distinction existed between the traditional outreach activities of Herman &apos;s office and the political fundraising work of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign . 
&quot; There was no fundraising activity organised by the White House or the OPL , &quot; he said . 
that would have been illegal . 
it is also illegal to use goverment property for campaign fundraising events . 
although top Democratic Party and Clinton-Gore campaign fundraising officials sat in on many of the kaffeeklatsches , Davis said that was not inappropriate . 
&quot; There is no question that people who were active in the fundraising efforts for the president &apos;s re-election came to the White House for many receptions , and many contributors came to the White House for many receptions . 
that is neither illegal or inappropriate or unusual , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Indeed , there isn &apos;t a single administration that we can find that didn &apos;t operate in the same fashion , &quot; Davis added . 
&quot; There was no pitch for money made at any of these events . 
however , a former official of a Republican White House who attended one of the kaffeeklatsches said fundraising seemed at least an implicit aim of the event . 
&quot; It was very clear when I sat down that we had not come to play cribbage , &quot; said the former official , who asked not to be identified . 
Republicans and other critics of the president have zeroed in on pro-Clinton fundraising that targeted Asian-Americans . 
the Democrats have returned $ 1.5 million in illegal or improper donations raised from this constituency . 
&quot; A critical component of the APA ( Asian Pacific American ) community &apos;s fundraising strategy is to gain advantage by raising as much money as possible at the earliest possible dates ; every dollar we raise is one less dollar available from the APA community for our opponents , &quot; said one of the documents made public on Friday . 
the document is entitled &quot; Clinton Administration Outreach to the Asian Pacific American Community in 1996 . 
&quot; Davis said it was prepared by David Tseng , a political appointee at the Labour Department working on his own time . 
presidential assistant Doris Matsui headed a working group responsible for Asian-American outreach that prepared much of the plan , but Davis said she had nothing to do with its fundraising chapter , which would have been illegal . 
John Huang , a onetime Democratic Party fundraiser who has become a pivotal figure in the campaign financing controversy , drafted that chapter and dictated it to Tseng , the White House official said .
