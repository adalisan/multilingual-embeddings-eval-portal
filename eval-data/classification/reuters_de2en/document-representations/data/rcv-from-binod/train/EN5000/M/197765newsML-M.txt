physical coffee markets in Europe were seen staying tight in the first half of 1997 as Latin American new crop flows were slow to respond to winter season demand in the northern hemisphere , German traders said . 
&quot; Central American and African quality arabicas are being snapped up on arrival and keen demand is being rolled into the forward dates , &quot; one said . 
&quot; This boosts demand for first quarter 1997 shipments from the Americas and enquiries for the second quarter . 
but while spot and 1996 dates and Jan / Feb 1997 were traded , buyers and sellers differed on prices beyond those dates . 
traders were doubted that the short supply situation in Colombia and Central America would ease in 1997 , and this kept their prices well above roaster buying ideas . 
Roasters had some gaps in their cover in the first quarter , both in Central Americans and Africans -- as replacement for Colombians -- and this underpinned differentials , traders said . 
new York arabicas ended at 122.50 cents / lb on December and 114.30 cents on March last Friday . 
Green coffee housed in U.S. warehouses fell sharply in October according to latest figures and analysts believed this to be bullish but traders here said the 351,000 bags fall had been anticipated and was built into prices . 
but a number of other factors could boost levels in the short term , they said . 
this included exaggerated Colombian prices which encouraged Central American growers to keep their prices up as well . 
Colombian coffee officials at a weekend meeting said the industry was torn between exporters calls for deregulation and threatening shortfalls in financial aid to boost efficiency . 
ethnic strife in Burundi and a regional economic embargo slowed exports flows of arabicas , traders also said . 
by contrast , robusta markets should be better supplied as Vietnam started shipping its new crop . 
this would help narrow London &apos;s Jan premium over March , which stood at $ 58 at 1140 GMT . 
outright prices of arabicas in Germany were marked down on the week by $ 9-14 per 50 kg fob , but the latest firmness in futures kept differentials firm , importers said . 
Colombia excelso was at $ 140 and Guatemala HB at $ 129 , with Brazils at $ 113 and Indonesian robustas at $ 64.50 Dec / Jan CIF .
