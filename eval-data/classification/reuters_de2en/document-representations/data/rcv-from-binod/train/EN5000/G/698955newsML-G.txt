the space shuttle Columbia and its seven astronauts dodged thunderstorms and soared into orbit on Tuesday to complete some unfinished business . 
the shuttle blasted off in a brilliant display of fire and smoke at 2 : 02 p.m. EDT ( 1802 GMT ) , making its second try at a science mission aborted in April because of power trouble . 
&quot; Godspeed , Columbia , &quot; launch controller Jim Toohey told the seven astronauts by radio shortly before blastoff . 
forecasters on Monday had given the shuttle only a 10 percent chance of an on-time launch from the Kennedy Space Centre because of Florida &apos;s notorious afternoon thunderstorms . 
NASA officials took the unusual step of moving up the launch time by 47 minutes , hoping to avoid the bad weather . 
in the end , the shuttle made it off the launch pad only 12 minutes late . 
the countdown was held up briefly while a weather reconaissance plane checked out a storm cloud south of the launch site . 
it was the second ride into space in three months for Columbia and its crew . 
the shuttle &apos;s first attempt at the 16-day science mission in April was aborted after only five days aloft because of a troublesome electricity generator -- only the third time NASA had ended a shuttle flight early because of a mechanical breakdown . 
&quot; We &apos;re very glad to have Jim Halsell and the rest of his crew back in orbit so they can finish the mission we got started but had to cut short , &quot; shuttle manager Loren Shriver said . 
workers at the Florida launch site prepared Columbia for a second attempt at the mission in near-record time . 
the $ 2 billion reusable spaceship spent only 56 days in its hangar , instead of the usual 85 days . 
the astronauts plan to perform 33 major experiments , including one in which controlled fires will be lighted to learn more about the way flame behaves in zero gravity . 
only a small fraction of the experiments were accomplished during the curtailed mission in April and scientists were eager to see their experiments completed . 
&quot; We got a taste of that mission in April , &quot; mission manager Joel Kearns said . 
&quot; We saw that we could set up the experiments to answer the critical questions we &apos;re going to pursue on this two-week mission . 
Columbia &apos;s crew will divide into two shifts to work around the clock in a European-built laboratory mounted in the shuttle &apos;s payload bay . 
aboard the Columbia were mission commander Jim Halsell , co-pilot Susan Still , mission specialists Janice Voss , Mike Gernhardt and Don Thomas and guest scientists Roger Crouch and Greg Linteris . 
the shuttle &apos;s mission is unrelated to the crisis aboard Russia &apos;s Mir space station . 
Columbia is not equipped for dockings and is too heavy to reach the station . 
the shuttle is scheduled to return to earth at the Kennedy Space Centre on July 17 .
