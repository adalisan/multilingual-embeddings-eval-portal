heavy speculative buying is fuelling sharply higher world gold prices but Dubai traders on Sunday said physical demand from their key markets remained subdued . 
&quot; The market is very crazy at the moment . 
it is running so high but there is low physical demand . 
prices rose too high in a short period of time , &quot; said one . 
&quot; Demand from India and Pakistan is low and the Asian market is dull . 
Dubai &apos;s benchmark Ten Tola bar -- 3.746 ounces of 24-carat gold -- was quoted by traders at 5,025 UAE dirhams ( $ 1,369 ) , up from 4,860-65 dirhams on February 24 . 
gold was last quoted on the international market early on Saturday at $ 363.35 / 3.85 compared to $ 351.85 / 352.35 an ounce a week ago . 
February witnessed strong demand and high turnover because of the Indian wedding season but traders said buying has since faded . 
&quot; The wedding demand is over and I expect the market to stay as it is for another week or so , &quot; said one . 
but others pinned hopes for a turnaround on the Dubai shopping Festival , which starts at the end of March . 
the 300-plus gold traders in Dubai use the festival to promote jewellery and bullion retail business , offering numerous raffles and price discounts to boost turnover . 
&quot; The festival is coming up in about one month and we hope this will boost the market . 
we will be giving away one kilo of gold everyday , &quot; said one trader , referring to the daily draw open to big spenders at the souk during the four-week event . 
other traders expected fresh buying to pick up if prices fall back . 
&quot; The market is a little slow . 
we are hoping price will go down again and people are expecting it to happen . 
but right now there is a lot of speculation , &quot; said one .
