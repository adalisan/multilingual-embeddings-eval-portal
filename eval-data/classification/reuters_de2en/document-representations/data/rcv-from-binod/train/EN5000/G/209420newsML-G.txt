radical opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi &apos;s &quot; reconciliation &quot; in France with Zaire &apos;s veteran President Mobutu Sese Seko , his one-time friend and long-time foe , raised eyebrows and blood pressure on Friday in the capital Kinshasa . 
Tshisekedi told Radio France International on Friday that Mobutu , who is in southern France recuperating from cancer surgery , had given him a mandate to form a national unity government . 
Mobutu &apos;s spokesman in Kinshasa , Professor Kabuya Lumuna , expressed astonishment . 
&quot; Mr Tshisekedi &apos;s obsession is to be prime minister . 
the obsession of every other Zairean at the moment is to win the war in the east , &quot; he told Reuters . 
&quot; Clearly he has taken his own thoughts for the thoughts of the president . 
Tshisekedi , speaking after talks with Mobutu late on Thursday , said dialogue was the only way to end a revolt by Tutsi and other Mobutu opponents who hold towns in the east . 
&quot; It must be resolved through negotiation because we have already shed too much blood of our people , &quot; he said , playing down the role of neighbouring Rwanda and adding that the month-old revolt was essentially an internal problem . 
Tshisekedi &apos;s supporters among students in Kinshasa have been at the forefront of a campaign against part-Tutsi Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo and spearheading demands that the army be given the means to impose a military solution . 
Tshisekedi said rebel leader Laurent Kabila , another veteran Mobutu foe , should have a role in Zaire as he too was party to the decisions of a 1992 sovereign national conference which Mobutu had re-endorsed . 
the conference , which effectively launched Zaire &apos;s much-delayed democratic transition , elected Tshisekedi prime minister in 1992 but Mobutu shunted him aside in 1993 , a decision Tshisekedi has always refused to accept . 
&quot; With this reconciliation that we have just had , President Mobutu ... will respect the constitutional act so that I lead what we call a government of national unity , &quot; Tshisekedi said . 
his comments made waves at home , not least in Kengo &apos;s camp . 
&quot; You cannot go to Cap-Martin to be appointed prime minister . 
you must be elected by parliament in Zaire and only after Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo has been voted out , &quot; Tharcisse Loseke Nembalemba , leader of Kengo &apos;s Union of Independent Democrats in the transitional parliament , commented . 
political opponents say Tshisekedi &apos;s &quot; national reconciliation &quot; has not been endorsed by any member of Mobutu &apos;s political family . 
other commentators suspect Mobutu may have made promises to his rival in order to embarrass him politically ahead of presidential and other elections to be held by July 1997 . 
&quot; In politics everything is possible . 
Mobutu can tell Tshisekedi he is prime minister and then straight away ask his advisor to deny it so as to make Tshisekedi look foolish , &quot; Honore Kilak , a leading youth activist , said . 
Tshisekedi &apos;s call for dialogue in the east found little echo in Kinshasa where the government and students in the streets have been calling for a military solution . 
but some Western diplomats in Kinshasa favour a negotiated solution . 
&quot; There are supposed to be elections in Zaire next year . 
if Kabila really is popular in the east then he should be encouraged to stand in them , &quot; one said .
