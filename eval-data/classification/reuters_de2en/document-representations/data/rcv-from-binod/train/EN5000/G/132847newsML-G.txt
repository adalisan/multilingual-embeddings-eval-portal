leading Australian racehorse trainer gai Waterhouse on Tuesday won an appeal against a three-month ban and said she was keen to get on with training her horses for next month &apos;s Melbourne Cup . 
Waterhouse and jockey Kevin Forrester were suspended from racing for three months by stewards of the Sydney turf Club ( STC ) , who held an inquiry into the way Forrester rode the Waterhouse-trained galloper Gossips during a race last month . 
Forrester was charged by the STC with failing to give Gossips &quot; every possible chance &quot; of winning the race , won by the Waterhouse-trained juggler . 
Waterhouse was charged with being a party to Forrester breaching the rules . 
while an appeal committee apointed by the Australian Jockey Club , the sport &apos;s national governing body , overturned Waterhouse &apos;s ban , the same committee dismissed Forrester &apos;s appeal but cut his suspension from three months to two . 
the successful appeal means Waterhouse is now free to continue training horses during the lucrative spring racing carnival which started this month in Melbourne , where juggler will run in Saturday &apos;s A $ 1.5 million ( US $ 1.2 million ) Cox plate . 
&quot; I feel relieved and very happy , &quot; Waterhouse told reporters on Tuesday . 
&quot; It has been very traumatic , a cloud hanging over me , but it hasn &apos;t impacted on the carnival preparations of my horses . 
another of Waterhouse &apos;s horses , Nothin &apos; Leica Dane , is among the early favourites to win the A $ 2.5 million ( US $ 2.0 million ) Melbourne Cup on November 5 .
