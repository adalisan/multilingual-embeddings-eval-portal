major Slovak shares closed mixed in quiet trading on the Bratislava Stock Exchange ( BSE ) on Tuesday , with losses to the average prices of steel maker VSZ and oil and gas storage Nafta dragging the SAX index down . 
both VSZ and Nafta closed up on the day , but their average prices , on which the SAX is calculated , were down by 8.57 and 3.99 percent respectively to pull the index down 4.4 points to 181.02 . 
brokers said prices are slowly nearing a level where investor interest may once again be piqued . 
&quot; We expected a fall in VSZ &apos;s average price , as it had been artificially boosted by settlements of older deals , &quot; said Libor Briska of Creditanstalt . 
&quot; Issues are soon to be cheap , if this development continues . 
overall volume increased to 625,007 shares , from 220,929 shares traded on Monday , while turnover rose to 245.02 million crowns , from 198.60 million .
