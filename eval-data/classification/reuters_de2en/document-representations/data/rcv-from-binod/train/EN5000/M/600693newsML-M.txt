Tokyo share prices sank , Japanese government bonds slid and the dollar dipped on Wednesday after a senior central banker was quoted as saying the Bank of Japan was considering the right timing to tighten credit . 
Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Toshihiko Fukui was quoted by an executive of a labour group as saying the central bank was considering the right timing to raise its official discount rate , at which it lends to commercial banks , but that the Bank of Japan did not want to make a hasty decision . 
the comment , made at a meeting with executives of Japan &apos;s largest grouping of labour unions , the Japanese Trade Union Confederation ( Rengo ) , triggered massive selling of Japanese government bond futures and cash bonds , traders said . 
Rengo on Wednesday urged the central bank to raise the key rate . 
the Tokyo stock market &apos;s key index , the 225-share Nikkei average , already undermined by worries over the strong yen , closed down 490.85 points at 19,841.98 , after earlier falling by more than 500 points . 
the dollar also edged down against the yen on the remark , which fanned speculation that the central bank might be willing to raise its rock-bottom interest rates sooner rather than later . 
the U.S. currency was around 113.45 yen in mid-afternoon trade after earlier hovering near 114 yen . 
the Bank of Japan cut the discount rate to a record low 0.5 percent in September 1995 to keep the economy from faltering . 
but speculation has been growing that it wants to tighten credit in view of the economy &apos;s recovery and amid calls for higher rates from some ruling politicians .
