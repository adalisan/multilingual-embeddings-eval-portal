the U.S. Army set up battle lines on Friday against mounting congressional pressure for it to cease training men and women recruits together because of alleged rape and sexual harassment of women by drill sergeants . 
&quot; From the army &apos;s point of view , separate training would be a step backwards , &quot; Army Secretary Togo West said on CNN . 
&quot; ... ( Mixed training ) is a good way to train , it &apos;s a necessary way to train . 
we need to keep doing that . 
defence Secretary William Cohen said on Thursday the question of mixed training should be studied and said he had an open mind about it -- but that it must not become a way to make women second-class soldiers . 
&quot; What I don &apos;t want to see take place is this be an opening wedge to try and say that women are not capable of fulfilling missions and trying to push that back , &quot; Cohen told reporters . 
opposition to the mixed training surfaced at a Senate hearing this week from legislators who said the investigation of nearly 50 Army drill instructors and other soldiers accused of rape or sex harassment showed the Army was playing with gunpowder by putting young women under the domination of male sergeants . 
three drill sergeants at Aberdeen proving Ground in Maryland have been charged with raping nine women in all , and four others have been charged with sexual harassment . 
&quot; That &apos;s ( like ) sitting there with a match near some gunpowder and expecting a spark not to fly every now and then and cause a problem , &quot; Sen. Rick Santorum , a Pennsylvania Republican , said . 
Sen. Dan coats , an Indiana Republican , told Army officials at the hearing that &quot; sexuality is one of the most basic of all human instincts . 
&quot; He said the Army &apos;s shock that some drill sergeants abuse their power when given control over young women &quot; ignores basic , fundamental understandings of human behaviour . 
but Army Secretary West said at the hearing the issue was not sexual urges , but the alleged illegal abuse by trainers of soldiers they were supposed to be training . 
army Chief of Staff General Dennis Reimer said it was not a question of policy but simply &quot; what &apos;s right and wrong , &quot; and said he was confident the problem could be solved . 
but four senators at the hearing questioned whether the Army was causing unnecessary problems by training men and women together , and some of them said it should reconsider the policy . 
the Senate hearing was the first of a series in Congress on the Army &apos;s sex scandal . 
sentiment in the House has not been measured . 
one of the few to publicly oppose mixed training was House appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston , a Louisiana Republican , who said the Army &apos;s &quot; misbegotten , misdirected policy &quot; throws men and women together and expects them to act like something they are not . 
but Representative Jane Harman , a California Democrat and member of the House National Security Committee , said on Friday she believed the mixed training issue was being used as a wedge by members of Congress who want to roll back the military role of women . 
Harman said she was happy with Cohen &apos;s statement that he would not allow it to be a wedge , but she was displeased he was willing to restudy the mixed-training question . 
&quot; I hope Secretary Cohen will reflect on the first part of his comment and realise he is playing into an agenda that would be devastating to women , &quot; she said .
