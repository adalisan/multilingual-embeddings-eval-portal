Iraq said the United States had fired missiles against military bases and civilian areas in the capital Baghdad on Wednesday evening and took reporters to inspect the damage . 
&quot; At 8.45 p.m. the American enemy directed its failing missiles against our military bases and civilian places and a number of them have fallen in Baghdad , &quot; Iraqi state television reported , quoting a communique issued by the general command of the Iraqi armed forces . 
the communique said there were casualties , including a number of people killed , and described U.S. President Bill Clinton as a &quot; war criminal &quot; . 
it added Iraqi air defences were able to shoot down many of the missiles . 
the United States denied there had been any attack . 
Western reporters were taken by the culture and information ministry to one of Baghdad &apos;s residential quarters where it said one of the U.S. cruise missiles landed . 
a small crater surrounded by debris and fragments scarred the main street of al-Huriyya township 10 km ( 6 miles ) away from the centre of the capital . 
eyewitnesses said the missile killed a young man , injured several others , destroyed two cars and slightly damaged nearby residential apartments . 
&quot; Holy jihad , holy jihad against Zionism and America , &quot; shouted Sabaa al-Mashhadani in front of western reporters who were taken to the site by ministry escorts . 
the floor of a residential apartment was littered with glass and furniture . 
&quot; What does America want from us ... what debts it has on us ? 
&quot; said Shahad Shalash with tears streaming down her face . 
eleven wounded people were admitted to a nearby hospital some of them with critical injuries . 
&quot; Our hospital has admitted 11 injured people as a result of al-Huriyya missile strike . 
two of them have undergone serious medical operations , &quot; physician Amad Hassan of al-Kadhimiya teaching hospital told reporters . 
&quot; What I can say to Clinton ... May God throw his anger against him , &quot; said the mother of Hazim Radhi who was severely injured . 
before the Iraqi announcement of the fresh missile attack , large explosions were heard in Baghdad and heavy anti-aircraft fire lit up the night sky . 
earlier in Washington the Pentagon denied it had launched any attack against the Iraqi capital .
