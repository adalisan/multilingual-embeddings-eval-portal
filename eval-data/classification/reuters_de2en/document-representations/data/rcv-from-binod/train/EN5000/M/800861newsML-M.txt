little activity was expected ahead of the long weekend in France , they said . 
&quot; This morning the market is very quiet , &quot; said Marc la Croix , broker at staff in Paris .

la Croix said if anything , after the move during the latter part of Wednesday &apos;s session , he expected the notionnel to go back to the 129.24-30 area and find support there . 
&quot; We will probably see some buying at these levels this afternoon , &quot; he said . 
Christian Bado , senior technical analyst at Ferrier Lullin in Geneva , said before testing support , the contract would move higher . 
&quot; It looks like a small short-term bottom has formed around 129.00 which suggests buys above 129.50 for a test 130.06 , &quot; he said . 
Bado said there was interim resistance at 129.80 . 
&quot; Any breakout from there would signify an impulsive wave to 130.05 before coming down again , &quot; he said .
