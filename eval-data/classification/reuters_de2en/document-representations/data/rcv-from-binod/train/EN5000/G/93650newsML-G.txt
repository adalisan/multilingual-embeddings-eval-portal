a Panamanian judge ruled that government officials committed no crime when they accepted campaign funds from a suspected drug kingpin in the ruling party &apos;s 1994 electoral campaign , a Supreme Court spokeswoman said on Wednesday . 
the ruling cleared the nation &apos;s third-highest ranking government official , Second Vice President Felipe Virzi , and Panama &apos;s former ambassador to Costa Rica , Felix Estripeaut . 
the scandal erupted in May when it was discovered that two checks for $ 51,000 each were contributed in 1994 to President Ernesto Perez Balladares &apos; campaign by accused Colombian drug lord Jose Castrillon Henao , currently held in a Panama City jail pending investigations on a number of charges . 
in his ruling , Judge Diego Fernandez underscored that the case could be reopened if new evidence was found , the spokeswoman said . 
Panama &apos;s chief drug prosecutor recommended in August to close the investigation after concluding there had been no impropriety because the campaign officials did not know of the possible drug connection . 
that recommendation , however , was subject to judicial review .
