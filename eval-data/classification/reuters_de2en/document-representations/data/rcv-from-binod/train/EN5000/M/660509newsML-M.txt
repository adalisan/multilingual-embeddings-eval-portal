long-delayed harvesting of hard red winter wheat in Texas looked set to roll this weekend , U.S. grain dealers said Friday . 
weather Services Corp said showers and thunderstorms would likely move across the southern U.S. Plains Friday and Saturday , with coverage expected at 50 to 60 percent . 
but dealers said the rains would probably be brief and would not cause the kind of delays seen over the last month . 
&quot; It might rain a while and hold things up , but the combines will probably get back in the fields in a few hours , &quot; an Oklahoma dealer said . 
meanwhile , basis bids for hard red winter wheat were steady to weaker and movement was slack , dealers said . 
basis values in cents / Bu against KCBT wheat , cash = dollars / Bu .
