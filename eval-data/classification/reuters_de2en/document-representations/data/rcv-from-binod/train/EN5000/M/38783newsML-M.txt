Large-lot speculative buying in the September Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures drove them up to the day &apos;s high at their expiry on Friday , giving a boost to the key December contract as well , traders said . 
&quot; It &apos;s a strange market . 
everybody was watching the last several minutes of wild movements in the September before its expiry ( at 0600 GMT ) , &quot; said a senior bank trader . 
September expired at the day &apos;s high of 122.50 , leaving some 500 contracts worth of buy orders untraded , after spending most of the day in negative territory . 
key December ended at 120.64 , up from 120.50 on Thursday . 
traders said that buy orders amounting to 500 contracts for the September came in the last several minutes of trade . 
the large-lot purchases reflected the speculative interest of long position holders , possibly U.S. hedge funds , who did not intend to buy as many as 500 contracts in the September but purely wanted to push up its settlement price . 
&quot; It was the craziest thing I have ever seen , but the price of the September contract was in fact jacked up and traders with short September positions would have a hard time finding deliverable cash issues , &quot; said a city bank trader . 
repo rates for cheapest deliverable issues , such as the 161st and 163rd JGBs , have already risen sharply reflecting the scarcity of those issues in the market . 
the repo rate for the 163rd JGB was at 6.1 percent , up from 0.2-0.3 percent a month earlier , traders said . 
in the cash market , sentiment has improved as most financial institutions have completed cashing in bonds ahead of end-September half-year book closings . 
but a further decline in Tokyo stocks would trigger more sales of bonds by banks which would be inclined to offset losses on stocks with gains on bonds , traders said . 
the yield of the benchmark 182nd 10-year bond was at 3.000 percent at 0700 GMT , down from 3.015 percent on Thursday . 
various media reports that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto looks set to hold elections in October have so far had limited impact . 
if an election were to be held in October , debate on a supplementary budget would be postponed until after the election . 
in that case , one dealer said , the size of the extra budget was likely to be smaller as politicians would not need to woo voters .
