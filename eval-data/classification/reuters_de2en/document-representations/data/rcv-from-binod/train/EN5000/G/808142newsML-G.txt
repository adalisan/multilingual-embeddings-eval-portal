a senior Tajik official said on Tuesday that government troops had crushed a mutiny in the south of the country and that the rebels &apos; leader , Colonel Makhmud Khudoyberdyev , appeared to have fled to neighbouring Uzbekistan . 
&quot; According to our unconfirmed reports , Khudoyberdyev and up to 40 of his men crossed into Uzbek territory overnight ... The rebel forces have been completely routed , &quot; Zafar Saidov , spokesman for President Imomali Rakhmonov , told Reuters . 
&quot; The Tajik government hopes that , if this report proves correct , the Uzbek leadership will honour its earlier commitments and will seize Khudoyberdyev and his followers and send them back to Tajikistan , &quot; Saidov said . 
he said those supporters of Khudoyberdyev who had not fled with him had broken up into small bands and were hiding in the mountains to avoid punishment . 
they had abandoned most of their heavier equipment , he added . 
Khudoyberdyev and his men have been retreating to the southwest of the impoverished former Soviet republic since their rebellion ended last Wednesday . 
despite reaching an accord with the government , they had refused to hand over their weapons . 
earlier on Tuesday , government troops entered the former rebel stronghold of Kabodien and were also reported by a government military source to be advancing on rebel-held Shaartuz , near the border with Afghanistan and the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan . 
a Reuter correspondent said only sporadic shooting was heard and reported no major fighting when the government troops took Kabodien , which lies 160 km ( 100 miles ) southwest of the capital Dushanbe . 
the latest turmoil to rock the impoverished former Soviet republic began with clashes in Dushanbe between competing warlords and presidential forces on August 9 and Khudoyberdyev began moving his brigade towards the capital . 
it came just weeks after Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov , who is backed by Moscow , signed a peace accord with Islamic opposition guerrillas aimed at ending four years of civil war . 
the Islamic guerrillas were not involved in the latest clashes .
