U.S. Midcontinent spot unleaded gasoline and diesel fuel prices plunged late Friday on reports of easing NYMEX front-month products prices . 
prices on September barrels in Chicago and Group Three tracked a sharp downward move in NYMEX unleaded and diesel futures contracts late in the day on reports Iraq pledged to suspend military action . 
perceptions of plentiful stocks in the region were expected to continue exerting downward pressure on unleaded and diesel basis in the Midwest next week , traders said . 
traders reported some discounting emerged this week at the wholesale level , which should translate into weaker prices on barrels for delivery in the final weeks of September . 
&quot; I think we &apos;re going to be discounting quite a bit , which will drive basis lower , &quot; one Kansas City , Mo . , trader said . 
&quot; wholesale values are going to come off , ( and ) there &apos;s already been some discounting . 
the Williams pipeline system , a key barometer of inventory levels in the region , reported a steady 21-day supply of gasoline and a growing 35-day supply of low sulphur diesel . 
unleaded differentials were unchanged in Chicago and Group Three , a common refrain on the week . 
low sulphur diesel differentials also were steady in discussion at week &apos;s end . 
high sulphur diesel remained even to 0.25 cent over the print in Chicago and 0.50 / 1.0 cent over the print in Group Three , traders said . 
jet / kero differentials also were unchanged in both markets .
