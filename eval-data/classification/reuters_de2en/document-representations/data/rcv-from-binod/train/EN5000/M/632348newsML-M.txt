Taiwanese buyers are expected to tender for 108,000 tonnes of South American soybeans this week , but stay out of the corn market , local traders said on Monday . 
&quot; soybean buyers are ready to cover their August supplies because recent South American prices are very good , &quot; one said . 
Taiwan &apos;s breakfast soybean Procurement Association recently bought two 54,000-tonne shipments at 40.38 U.S. cents a tonne over Chicago futures -- surprisingly lower than earlier U.S. Gulf basis premiums which had been about 80 U.S. cents . 
&quot; The breakfast Association buyers are hoping to get two more shipments at prices around 50 U.S. cents over Chicago futures per tonne , &quot; the trader said . 
traders said the recent rally in Chicago soybean prices meant the U.S. market was not attractive for sourcing . 
Taiwanese buyers currently have little interest in corn as they expect Chicago corn futures to fall further . 
&quot; buyers are likely to stay sidelined and wait for the corn futures to settle down , a corn buyer said . 
local Pacific Northwest freight cost were about US $ 11.00 a tonne and from the Gulf of Mexico at about US $ 20.50 a tonne , both for Panamax-sized June shipments .
