NWE gasoline prices softened in late Friday trade as futures eased , but tight high octane supply and good barge demand underpinned the market , traders said . 
barges were actively traded , with one Rotterdam refiner continuing to feature prominently as a buyer . 
Eurograde barges traded $ 2 firmer at $ 214.50 for refinery Rotterdam liftings . 
cargo talk was thin with arbitrage narrow and NWE demand thin . 
&quot; It ( the arbitrage ) is not a window that &apos;s working brilliantly at the moment , but with the tight high octane situation at the moment , I expected people will be happy just to hang on to stocks , &quot; one trader said .
