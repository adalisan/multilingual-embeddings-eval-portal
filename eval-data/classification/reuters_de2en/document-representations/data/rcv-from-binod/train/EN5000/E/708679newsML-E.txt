average inflation in Italy for the first six months of 1997 stood at 2.0 percent compared with the same period of 1996 , an official of the state statistics institute Istat said on Friday . 
the official was speaking to reporters as Istat released figures showing the consumer price index rose 1.4 percent year on year in June . 
he added that year-on-year inflation in July could rise to 1.6 percent even if the month-on-month figure was unchanged . 
he said this was because the index fell 0.2 percent month-on-month in July 1996 .
