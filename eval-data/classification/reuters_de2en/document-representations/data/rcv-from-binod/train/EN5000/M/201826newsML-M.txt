Hong Kong stocks moved ahead in early Tuesday morning trade , chiefly on buying interest from the U.S. and local funds , brokers said . 
&quot; There is still alot of overseas money coming into the market , especially since other markets are quiet , &quot; said Francis Wu , institutional sales manager at South China Securities . 
the Hang Seng Index put on 43 points to trade at 13,086 on robust turnover of HK $ 1.38 billion after only half an hour of trade . 
&quot; The market could test yesterday &apos;s intraday high and possibly set another high , but a correction could come at any time , &quot; Wu said . 
property shares again led the market &apos;s advance on Tuesday . 
&quot; Property sales are hot , and so are property stocks , &quot; said Michael ng , dealing director at Sassoon Securities . 
&quot; We have seen local institutional investors buying property stocks yesterday . 
brokers said there was also interest in New World Infrastructure . 
both shares were sold off sharply after reporting relatively lacklustre earnings earlier this month . 
finance counters continued to come under selling pressure . 
a HSBC spokesman in Hong Kong said he could give no final confirmation to a news report issued on Monday saying permission from Beijing to allow foreign banks to do renminbi business was to come soon . 
technical indicators are mixed , analysts said . 
they put near-term resistance at 13,200 and support at around 12,900 . 
the November Hang Seng Index futures contract put on 20 points to 13,040 , but at that level continues to trade at a 40-point discount to the cash market , brokers said .
