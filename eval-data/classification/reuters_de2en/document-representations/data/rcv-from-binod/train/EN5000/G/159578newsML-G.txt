Wellington , Nov 1 - New Zealand Cricket &apos;s marketing manager Neil Maxwell has just learned that seven overs he bowled for Australia A against the West Indies last summer have denied him any opportunity of playing for New Zealand this summer . 
Maxwell was born in Fiji and spent the first seven years of his life there before his parents returned to Australia . 
that made him eligible , under the International Cricket Council &apos;s laws , to play for New Zealand immediately if it wasn &apos;t for those seven overs for Australia A. 
he now faces a two-year stand-down period before being considered . 
Maxwell , who is based in Christchurch , is keen to play for Canterbury this season .
