CBOT soft red winter wheat futures were lower at midsession on technical signals and on hedge selling , traders said . 
&quot; It looked like a little hedging came in on the open , not a lot but enough to take it down a little , &quot; a cash-connected trader said . 
technicians continued to point to the overbought signals as rationale for the wheat market &apos;s struggle to rally . 
an RSI of 70 or more is considered near overbought status for short-term traders . 
support came from the rally in corn and soybeans with a sale of U.S. wheat to Pakistan taken in stride by the market . 
&quot; The Pakistan wheat sale isn &apos;t necessarily supportive . 
but if it hadn &apos;t happened it would have been negative , it removes another unknown from the market , &quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter . 
Pakistan bought 500,000 tonnes of white wheat with 200,000 from the U.S. , 250,000 from Australia and 50,000 from Canada , according to the Washington D.C.-based Pakistani Embassy . 
mild underpinning may have come from a slight decline in the condition rating for the U.S. spring wheat crop . 
USDA Monday said the spring wheat crop as of Sunday was 50 percent good to excellent , below the 52 percent in that category the previous week . 
also USDA Monday said the U.S. winter wheat harvest was 79 percent complete as of Sunday , above the 78 percent a year ago and above the 77 percent average pace . 
persistent drier-than-desired weather in portions of Australia &apos;s wheat growing region and mounting concern about dry weather in China &apos;s grain / soy belt also helped underpin wheat futures , traders said . 
in early dealings , prudential Securities bought one half million bushels of December , Paine Webber bought 300,000 bushels of December and there was a substantial amount of small lot commission house buying on the open , traders said . 
lit America and Rand Financial sold one half million bushels of December , traders said . 
Merrill Lynch futures sold 300,000 bushels of September , Cargill investor Services bought 200,000 bushels of September and sold 300,000 bushels of September , traders said .
