Sir Christopher Haskins , chairman of British food producer Northern Foods , called on Britain to join a single European currency . 
&quot; If there is one company that thinks EMU is a good idea it is us , &quot; Haskins told reporters , after the company reported half year profits impacted by the strength of sterling against other European currencies . 
he said EMU would help remove fluctuations in its profits , overstated last year because of sterling &apos;s weakness in Europe and then understated this year . 
in September Northern was among a group of 15 top British companies that warned in a letter to the Financial Times newspaper of the dangers of Britain shunning a single European currency .
