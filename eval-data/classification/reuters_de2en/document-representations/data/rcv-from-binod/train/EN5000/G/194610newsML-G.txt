the Civic Democratic Party ( ODS ) of conservative Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus won a commanding 36.47 percent of the national vote in the first round of Senate elections , the Central Election Commission said on Saturday . 
the opposition Social Democrats came second with 20.27 percent in the polls , which operate under a British-style first past the post system rather than the proportional representation used for Czech lower house elections .
