Algerian labour leader Abdelhaq Benhamouda has said he will launch a political party to defend working-class interests , which he said had been betrayed by political mediocrity . 
&quot; The idea to create a new party was born from a reality in which , on one hand , politicians never proposed solutions and alternatives to the social and economic situation and on the other hand a union movement which does not have the means for its policy , &quot; he said in an interview with the Algerian newspaper Le Matin published on Monday . 
Benhamouda leads the umbrella Union Generale des Travailleurs Algeriens ( UGTA ) which says it represents more than one million unionised workers . 
he was instrumental in founding an anti-Islamist organisation in 1992 to back the authorities in their drive to cancel a general election in which radical Moslem fundamentalists had taken a commanding lead . 
Benhamouda , a former teacher in his 40s , escaped assassination in 1993 when Moslem guerrillas sprayed his car in Algiers with machinegun fire . 
his brother was shot dead a year later by Moslem rebels . 
&quot; Our goal is to found a popular movement in which the mainstream of civil society will be represented , not an elite party , &quot; said Benhamouda , who plans to leave his union post . 
&quot; The threat facing Algeria today is the mediocrity ( in politics ) , &quot; he said . 
Benhamouda said he began contacts several months ago to drum up support for his planned party , but gave no date for launching it . 
Algeria has more than 60 political parties since ushering in a legal multi-party system in 1989 . 
the government is set to tighten rules on party activities , including banning Islamists from the legal political system . 
other politicians plan a new party , the Revolutionary Family , to draw support from former nationalist fighters in Algeria &apos;s war for independence from France . 
Algeria plunged into civil strife in 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which the now banned radical Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) had taken a huge lead . 
about 60,000 people have died in the violence .
