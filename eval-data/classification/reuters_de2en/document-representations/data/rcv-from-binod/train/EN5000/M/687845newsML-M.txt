SIMEX Brent crude futures were untraded at midday in Asia but were marked lower after bearish API data and Iraq plans to export oil in 7-10 days . 
August Brent crude was quoted at $ 17.50 / $ 17.80 per barrel after London dropped 11 cents to $ 17.87 . 
both London and New York fell overnight after Iraq oil minister Amir Rasheed said in Madrid that the country would resume oil exports in seven to 10 days . 
the bearish tone was extended through by API data after the close of New York , which showed that refinery utilisation rates remained high at 97.6 percent . 
August was last traded at $ 18.91 per barrel , down 12 cents after New York fell back below the critical $ 19.04 level on Tuesday . 
a break up through that level on Monday has spurred some technical follow through buying , but was now likely to act as resistance again , traders said . 
OPEC was having little affect on prices as major members said they favoured a roll over of quotas .
