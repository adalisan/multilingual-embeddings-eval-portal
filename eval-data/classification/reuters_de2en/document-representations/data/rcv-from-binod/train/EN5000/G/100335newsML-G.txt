former Indian prime minister P.V. 
Narasimha Rao on Monday won a brief respite as the Supreme Court reserved a decision in a criminal &quot; cheating &quot; case in which he has been summoned by a Delhi court to testify . 
until the Supreme Court pronounces its order , Rao cannot be summoned by the lower court , officials said . 
the Supreme court had not said when it would give its order , they added . 
the case in which Rao has been accused of criminal conspiracy involves a business tycoon who says he paid $ 100,000 to a Rao acquaintance in 1983 in a failed attempt to win a government contract .
