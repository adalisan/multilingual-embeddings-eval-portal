new Zealand captain Sean Fitzpatrick has been included in the All Blacks team to play Australia on Saturday but selectors have given him until the end of the week to prove he has recovered from a knee injury . 
the veteran All Blacks hooker was bracketed with norm Hewitt in the team announced by New Zealand selectors on Wednesday . 
Fitzpatrick has been under a cloud since being replaced during the second half of his side &apos;s epic 35-32 win over the South Africa in the opening match of the Tri-Nations Series in Johannesburg last Saturday . 
Fitzpatrick consulted an orthopaedic surgeon in Melbourne on Tuesday only hours after the team arrived . 
while Fitzpatrick declared after the consultation he would play , New Zealand coach John Hart doubted his kingpin would regain fitness in time . 
Fitzpatrick was unable to run with the team in their first training sesssion on Tuesday and Hewitt , the form hooker of this year &apos;s Super 12 provincial series , will slot in to the test side if Fitzpatrick is unable to prove his coach wrong . 
&quot; I think the medical view is less optimistic than my captain &apos;s , &quot; Hart told reporters after Tuesday &apos;s training run . 
&quot; But we will give him every chance to get it right . 
we will delay until Saturday ... to have him right if necessary . 
number eight Zinzan Brooke will assume the captaincy if Fitzpatrick is unable to play . 
new Zealand &apos;s backline has been reshuffled for the second match of the Bledisloe Cup series , which began with a crushing 30-13 defeat of Australia in Christchurch on July 5 . 
winger Tana Umaga came off in the second half in Johannesburg with bruised ribs and has been replaced by the experienced Glen Osborne . 
Alama Ieremia , who came on for Umaga in Johannesburg , moves into the centre in place of Lee Stensness , whose defence came under question against the Springboks . 
Australia made three changes from the team which beat England 25-6 on July 12 , with props Richard Harry and Andrew Heath recalled to strengthen the front row in a match expected to be played before a record Australian crowd of about 100,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . 
Michael Brial also replaces Troy Coker at number eight .
