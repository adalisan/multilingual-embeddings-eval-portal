Dutch economic growth should pick up slightly next year , with exports taking over from consumer spending as the driving force , the government &apos;s Central Planning Bureau said in a forecast accompanying the 1997 budget . 
short-term leading indicators suggest that growth of business production will pick up to three percent in the second half of 1996 while medium-term indicators show that the upturn is likely to last at least until the middle of 1997 , it added . 
the CPB said the recent upswing in the Dutch economy was largely attributable to strong consumer spending . 
but it predicted a marked slowdown in consumer spending in the second half of 1996 and in 1997 , saying real disposable incomes were not strong enough to sustain high spending levels . 
the CPB forecasts a real increase of 1.75 percent in consumer spending in 1997 after a rise of 2.5 percent in 1996 . 
short-term indicators pointed to a revival of export growth in the second half of this year after a slack period , though this would be fairly moderate as the Netherlands &apos; main export markets were showing only a modest recovery , the CPB said . 
Dutch competitiveness was expected to be barely changed in 1997 , so exporters should at least be able to maintain their market share next year , it added . 
real growth of exports is forecast at six percent in 1997 , versus 4.5 percent for the whole of 1996 . 
on balance the CPB expects business investment excluding housing to show an increase of 2.5 percent in 1997 , versus 4.5 percent in 1996 . 
by contrast , investment in housing is projected to rise three percent in 1997 , versus 0.75 percent in 1996 . 
the CPB said the labour market was developing favourably , with about 110,000 jobs of 12 or more hours a week likely to be created this year and a similar number next year . 
this should reduce internationally standardised unemployment rate to 5.25 percent in 1997 from 6.0 percent in 1996 , it said . 
import prices had put substantial upward pressure on Dutch consumer prices in 1996 , but despite this consumer price inflation had remained moderate , the CPB said . 
in the second half of 1996 inflation was likely to pick up slightly to a year-on-year rate of around 2.5 percent , remaining at that level on average throughout 1997 , it said . 
import prices and housing rents would contribute less to overall consumer price inflation in 1997 , but the contribution from domestic labour costs would rise , the CPB said . 
wage rates in the market sector would rise by an average of about 2.5 percent in 1997 after a rise of 1.5 percent in 1996 , but this did not represent a departure from the long-standing Dutch practice of voluntary wage restraint , the CPB added .
