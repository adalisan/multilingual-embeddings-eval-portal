NWE gasoline was firmer on Monday in a characteristically slow start to the week , traders said . 
one prompt Eurograde barge was heard traded . 
of its contents , 600 tonnes of Eurograde were sold at $ 220 fob Ara , 400 tonnes of Regular unleaded changed hands at $ 213 , and 300 tonnes of Superplus was done at $ 238 . 
dealers said they thought U.S. numbers were sufficiently high to attract European cargoes across the Atlantic , although the poor supply situation meant that little product was expected to move that way .
