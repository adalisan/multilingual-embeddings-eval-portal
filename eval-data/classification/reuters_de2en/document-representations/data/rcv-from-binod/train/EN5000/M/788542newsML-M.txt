Russian debt prices powered to new highs on Friday on growing confidence a deal with the London Club of bank creditors was on the way , keeping traders upbeat despite weaker U.S. bonds . 
Dollar-denominated loans from Vneshekonombank , which two years ago were trading at 29 cents on the dollar , have risen above par value for the first time following news of progress in restructuring the debt . 
Russia &apos;s Finance Ministry said on Friday it had fully reconciled 70 percent of the $ 24 billion principal of the $ 35 billion total commercial debt , which was taken on by Vneshekonombank after the collapse of the Soviet Union . 
David Boren , vice-president of economic and market analysis at Salomon Brothers Inc , said the value of Vnesh loans could rise further as evidence mounted that the debt deal was effectively in the bag . 
&quot; If the news of reconciliation of 70 percent at this stage in the process is enough to cause this kind of market response then the actual signing could trigger another rally , &quot; he said . 
the market is expecting the agreement will be ready for signing by September or October , leaving enough time to close the deal well before the year-end . 
uncertainty about the fate of the commercial debt has in the past made investors wary of taking on Vnesh paper . 
but in recent days the spread of the bank &apos;s dollar loans over U.S. Treasury bonds has narrowed to around 500 basis points and traders predict it could fall to nearer 400 , in line with a worldwide tightening of emerging market debt spreads . 
&quot; Russian spreads have tightened quite a lot in the last week or so , reflecting increased confidence ... We may pause around these levels but generally I think the trend will be continuing tightening , &quot; said one debt trader . 
&quot; going through the par level has been been quite a big psychological breakthrough . 
although Russia &apos;s problems with tax collection remain a major concern , analysts say many fundamentals are moving in right direction . 
in particular , the market has taken heart from a more competitive approach to privatisation , evidenced by the recent hotly-contested sale of stakes in telecommunications concern Svyazinvest and Norilsk nickel .
