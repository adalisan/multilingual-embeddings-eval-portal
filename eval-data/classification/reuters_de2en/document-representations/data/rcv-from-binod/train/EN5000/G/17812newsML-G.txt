South Korea has told its overseas missions to step up security since its embassy in the former Yugoslavia received a threat over Seoul &apos;s crackdown on radical students , the foreign ministry said on Tuesday . 
a letter to the Belgrade embassy on Monday under the name of the Macedonian Communist Party demanded South Korea release detained student leaders , a ministry spokesman said . 
&quot; The letter said the party would assault the embassy , other South Korean-related facilities and Korean nationals unless our authorities released arrested students , &quot; he said . 
nearly 400 members of an outlawed student group were arrested after violent protests demanding reunification with communist North Korea were crushed by riot police at a Seoul university this month . 
authorities branded the violence , in which a police officer was killed , as an act of terror . 
&quot; The ministry has ordered the embassy to take urgent security measures against possible terrorist attacks , &quot; the official said , asking not to be named . 
it had called for similar precautions at other overseas missions , including those in Canada and Bangladesh where leftist groups have staged protests over the crackdown .
