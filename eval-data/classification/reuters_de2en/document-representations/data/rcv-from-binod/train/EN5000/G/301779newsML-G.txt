Bahrain said it was ready to back a memorandum of understanding to end a war of words with Qatar if the deal helped boost bilateral ties , a Bahraini cabinet minister said in remarks published on Sunday . 
the foreign ministers of both countries , locked in a bitter territorial dispute , were expected to sign the memorandum at a meeting of their four Gulf Arab allies due to begin in Riyadh later in the day . 
&quot; If there is any signing on anything that achieves stronger ties , then Bahrain is willing , &quot; Cabinet and Information Minister Mohammad Ibrahim al-Mutawae told a Gulf newspaper when asked if Manama would sign the deal . 
&quot; We are going to the meeting with an open heart to maintain the everlasting links with the brotherly people of Qatar and we hope bilateral ties will go back to normal , &quot; he told the Arabic-language al-Khaleej daily published in the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) . 
the seven-point document has been drafted by Saudi Arabia , which heads a Gulf Cooperation Council mediation committee -- also grouping Kuwait , Oman and the UAE . 
&quot; Besides discouraging the negative media campaign , it ( the document ) commits the two parties to desist from making wild charges against each other and use their official and diplomatic channels to express their points of view , &quot; a Gulf diplomatic source told Reuters on Friday . 
&quot; But it does not address the heart of the territorial dispute between the two countries . 
Qatar and Bahrain have been in dispute for decades over a cluster of potentially oil-rich Gulf islands , sandbanks and reefs held by Manama since the 1930s but also claimed by Doha . 
Qatar has taken the case to the International Court of Justice at The Hague , a move opposed by Bahrain which insists on an Arab solution . 
ties worsened further after Bahrain accused two Qataris of spying and boycotted the GCC &apos;s December summit to protest against Qatar &apos;s refusal to withdraw the case . 
Bahrain last month pardoned the two Qataris after a state security court sentenced them to three years in jail for spying . 
Doha granted political asylum to a Bahraini air force pilot , who defected to Qatar in December but returned his helicopter . 
the foreign ministers of Qatar and Bahrain met in Riyadh last week under the auspices of the GCC committee for the first time in more than a year .
