grain prices in China are expected to drop further in 1997 and industry experts say marketing problems could hit the autumn harvest next year , the China Economic Times said on Friday . 
grain supply was seen exceeding demand in 1997 and planting and weather conditions indicated a good summer crop next year , the newspaper quoted officials from the Ministry of Agriculture as saying . 
the time was ripe for China to reform its grain marketing system , the newspaper said , adding that difficulties in selling grain would sap planting incentives for farmers . 
&quot; If difficulties in selling grain are exacerbated , prices will plummet to a level below farmers &apos; production costs , then it will reduce farmers &apos; enthusiasm for planting and output will drop , &quot; the newspaper said . 
China &apos;s central authorities buy a certain amount of grain from farmers at below market prices to ensure ample stores in state granaries . 
the price of corn next year was seen fluctuating around the current level of about 1,350 yuan ( $ 162 ) a tonne . 
supply of rice and wheat would continue to be tight while a shortage of soybeans was predicted , it said . 
&quot; The adjustment of the grain product structure will be a major aspect of grain work in 1997 , &quot; it said . 
plantings of cotton and oil-producing crops were seen falling in 1997 but supply and demand would be basically even , it said . 
international grain prices were now too low for China to export but an expected market rebound in the second half of 1997 could boost sales of grain abroad , it said .
