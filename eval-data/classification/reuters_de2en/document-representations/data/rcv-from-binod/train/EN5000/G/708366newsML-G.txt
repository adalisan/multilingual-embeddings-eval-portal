Fiji has begun the process of amending its racially-biased constitution which was introduced to prevent the South Pacific nation &apos;s Indian population re-gaining political control after a 1987 military coup . 
the Fijian parliament &apos;s lower house passed a bill late on Thursday which will open the way for a multi-racial government and permit a non-indigenous Fijian to become prime minister . 
the upper house will vote on the bill next week , but if passed the new constitution would not come into effect until July 1998 . 
the next election is due in 1999 . 
Fiji was thrown out of the Commonwealth after the military coup and has been refused re-entry because of its racially-biased constitution . 
&quot; I think this is a defining moment for Fiji and I think we can all work together now , &quot; JAI Ram Reddy , leader of the Indian-based opposition , said after the vote . 
Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka , who led the 1987 coup which overthrew the then Indian-dominated government , said he would be seeking a multi-racial cabinet under the new constitution . 
but Rabuka warned the upper house of parliament still had to pass the legislation . 
&quot; There is still another chamber to be satisfied , &quot; Rabuka said on Thursday . 
on Friday , Fiji &apos;s business and diplomatic community welcomed the move , saying a new constitution would boost investor confidence and reflected the country &apos;s strong democracy . 
&quot; The overwhelming vote in favour of the legislation is a very positive signal to the rest of the world that Fiji is laying the foundations for the 21st century , &quot; said U.S. 
Ambassador Don Givertz . 
the present constitution , introduced in 1990 by Rabuka , gives indigenous Fijians 37 seats in the 70-seat parliament , reserved 27 seats for Indians and split the remaining six between mixed-race politicians and Rotuman islanders . 
under the amended constitution , a 71-seat parliament will see 23 indigenous Fijian seats , 19 Indian seats , three for mixed races , one for Rotumans and 25 open seats for any race . 
Indians , who were brought to Fiji at the turn of the century to work on sugar plantations , now make up 45 per cent of the country &apos;s 750,000-strong population and are influential in the business community .
