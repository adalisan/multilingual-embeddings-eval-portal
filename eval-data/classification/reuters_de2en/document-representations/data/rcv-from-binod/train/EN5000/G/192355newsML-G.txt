the Australian Medical Association ( AMA ) called on Friday for the government to abandon its commitment to community rating and redirect its budget health insurance rebate to the elderly and chronically ill . 
&quot; The move would give the government subsidy directly to high users of the private health system , &quot; AMA federal president Keith Woollard said in a statement . 
&quot; This would reduce the need for cross-subsidisation from the young and fit , providing lower premiums and greater incentive for younger Australians to take out and retain private health cover . 
under the community rating system , the age of clients is not taken into account when insurance premiums are calculated . 
the system tends to subsidise older people at the expense of the young , but many young people find premiums unjustifiably high and do not take out insurance . 
the Australian government announced plans in its August 20 budget to introduce a tax rebate to people who take out health insurance . 
the measure is expected to cost the budget A $ 113 million in 1998 / 99 , its first year of operation .
