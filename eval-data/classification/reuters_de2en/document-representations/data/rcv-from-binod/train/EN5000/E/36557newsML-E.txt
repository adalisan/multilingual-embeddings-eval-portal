budget experts from Chancellor Helmut Kohl &apos;s ruling coalition geared up on Friday for weekend talks aimed at cutting 1997 government spending by 11 billion marks ( $ 7.41 billion ) from this year &apos;s level to 440 billion marks . 
ahead of the meeting , junior coalition partners the Free Democrats ( FDP ) were unusually open in their criticism of the government &apos;s budget and labour policies . 
Otto Lambsdorff , honorary chairman and economic spokesman of the FDP , sounded more like an opposition Social Democrat ( SPD ) when he said the government &apos;s deficit in 1997 would be 10 billion marks larger than planned . 
Germany was moving further away from qualifying for the single European currency , he said . 
&quot; In view of the dramatic labour market situation , one can only fear that this figure will rise even higher , &quot; Lambsdorff , told the Cologne-based newspaper Express . 
the SPD sees an 18 billion mark gap between budgeted spending and revenues next year that is not covered by planned government borrowing . 
even with cuts in outlays , lower tax revenues mean the government will not achiev its earlier deficit-reduction goals . 
the weekend talks were expected to approve a plan by Finance Minister Theo Waigel to raise the level of 1997 government borrowing to 56.5 billion marks , up seven billion marks from a medium-term plan drafted in 1995 . 
the 1996 budget deficit , planned at 60 billion marks , is now seen at 70 billion to 75 billion marks . 
the 1997 draft budget was approved by the cabinet in July and should have a first reading in parliament next week . 
the weekend could also see political temperatures rise as unions hold demonstrations in major cities across the country to protest against the government &apos;s planned savings measures , which they say will hurt jobs . 
&quot; This is an unholy alliance of capital and cabinet , &quot; Ursula Engelen-Kefer , deputy chairman of the DGB union , said . 
&quot; They want to be able to hire and fire like mediaeval lords . 
Waigel has vowed to bring Germany &apos;s overall public deficit down to 2.5 percent of GDP in 1997 , comfortably below the 3.0 percent target set by the Maastricht Treaty for participants in European monetary union ( EMU ) . 
but few believe that rosy scenario . 
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) said on Thursday that Germany might just make the 3.0 percent target in 1997 if it implements all its planned savings measures . 
the federal budget deficit , however , accounts for only half of Germany &apos;s total public deficit . 
the rest stems from state and local governments , pensions and social security , over which Waigel has less control . 
hitting the Maastricht economic criteria required for EMU membership will be hard . 
an economic slump has hurt tax revenues , boosted outlays for jobless benefits , and lowered the tolerable deficit ceiling . 
FDP deputy Juergen Koppelin backed the SPD view that unemployment benefits alone would run seven billion marks above budgeted levels in 1996 . 
Koppelin said further austerity measures would have to be found to make up this sum . 
Germany and other European nations must meet strict deficit and debt targets if they hope to qualify for EMU in 1997 , the key year for deciding the starting participants when a single European currency , the Euro , is launched in 1999 . 
Lambsdorff said the situation was getting worse instead of better , as German unemployment was headed towards five million . 
unemployment has hovered around a postwar record of four million since the start of the year . 
the government &apos;s goal is to halve this figure by the year 2000 but Lamsdorff called the target illusory .
