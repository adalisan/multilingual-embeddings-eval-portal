South Korea and China on Thursday discussed the fate of the most senior North Korean official to flee the hermit Stalinist state , but no progress was reported . 
&quot; It &apos;s still going on , &quot; South Korean Embassy spokesman Chang Moon-ik said of the talks about Hwang Jang-yop , Pyongyang &apos;s top ideological theoretician . 
Hwang walked into Seoul &apos;s mission in Beijing on February 12 and has been there ever since . 
&quot; Not this month , &quot; Chang said when asked if Hwang would be able to leave China in February . 
in Seoul , the Defence Ministry said a barefoot North Korean woman defected to South Korea on Thursday across the demilitarised zone bisecting the peninsula . 
it said the woman was in her 20s but gave no other details . 
Chang declined to say what issues , if any , were holding up negotiations on Hwang and would not say if he would be allowed to leave next month . 
&quot; It &apos;s very hard to say when this case will be over , &quot; he said . 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang called for calm and said Beijing did not wish to see new tension on the Korean peninsula . 
&quot; We ( China ) hope that all sides concerned seek with a calm and objective attitude a solution to appropriately resolve the matter to maintain peace and stability in the Korean peninsula , &quot; Tang told a news briefing . 
&quot; We do not wish to see this matter giving rise to new tensions in the Korean peninsula . 
whether the problem is resolved fast or slow hinges completely on when and under what circumstances ( the ) concerned sides find a way to appropriately resolve it , &quot; he said . 
Hwang &apos;s defection has entangled China in the enmity between Pyongyang and Seoul , forcing Beijing to choose between its old communist comrades and a new capitalist partner . 
analysts say China will in the end almost certainly allow Hwang , the architect of North Korea &apos;s governing ideology of strict self-reliance , to go to Seoul . 
but Beijing also wants to help its Stalinist neighbour save face by being seen to give Pyongyang &apos;s concerns due attention . 
the death of China &apos;s paramount leader , Deng Xiaoping , on February 19 put the negotiations over Hwang &apos;s fate largely on hold , but six days of mourning for the Chinese patriarch ended with his funeral on Tuesday . 
the talks resumed in Beijing on Wednesday . 
Chinese police backed by armoured personnel carriers and a riot truck maintained a tight guard around the Seoul mission on a cold , grey Thursday , sealing off surrounding streets in the placid tree-lined embassy district . 
Vanloads of police also kept a close watch on Pyongyang &apos;s embassy a few kilometers ( miles ) away . 
Hwang &apos;s defection threw extra strain on ties between the two Koreas -- still technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended only in a truce -- but there have been signs in recent days that the crisis may be easing . 
Pyongyang , which at first insisted that Hwang had been kidnapped by South Korean agents , softened its stance last week by vowing to dismiss the ideologue if he had in fact defected .
