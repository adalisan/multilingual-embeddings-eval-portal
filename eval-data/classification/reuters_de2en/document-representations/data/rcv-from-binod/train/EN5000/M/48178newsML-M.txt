world energy markets were on alert on Thursday after tension over Iraq propelled the price of oil to a post-Gulf war high and the dollar retreated from near two-month peaks against the mark and yen scaled in Europe the previous day . 
on the bourses , leading shares in London and Paris opened higher after a positive overnight close on Wall Street , which ended nearly half a percent higher . 
Frankfurt , however , was mixed , marking time ahead of key U.S. producer prices due out later in the day . 
another round of U.S.-Iraq tensions put crude oil markets on full alert as Washington signalled it would retaliate for an Iraqi missile shot at U.S. warplanes . 
the benchmark Brent crude contract rose overnight in Asia to a high of $ 23.82 , levels not since the 1991 Gulf War , after news that Iraq had launched a surface-to-air missile at two U.S. fighters patrolling the northern no-fly zone . 
on the foreign exchange front , the dollar drifted lower in the European morning , unable to sustain Wednesday &apos;s rally to 1.5155 marks and 110.40 yen as short-term players took profits above 110 yen and 1.51 marks , dealers said . 
&quot; People have become a bit wary after the dollar failed to hold above 110 yen and 1.51 marks , &quot; said Chris tinker , chief economist at Standard Chartered . 
&quot; The range-trading mentality has returned to the market , with a bias to test the downside . 
a near-term rise in U.S.interest rates was priced into the dollar , analysts said and signs of strength in the August U.S. producer price data ( due at 1230 GMT ) , and Friday &apos;s consumer prices , would cement the outlook for a credit tightening . 
the inflation data moved into focus after comments from Federal Reserve Governor Janet Yellen on Tuesday , who said the U.S. economy had entered an inflationary danger zone . 
on European bourses , London shares opened up and traded higher despite British retail price inflation data which came in towards the upper end of forecasts . 
the London market was buzzing as it got to grips with one of the busiest days of the year for corporate results . 
early trading was dominated by the string of company news , as the market moved to digest figures from over 40 companies , including seven from the main blue chip FTSE 100 index . 
British Aerospace , United News &amp; Media , RTZ , British Gas , BTR , United Biscuits and Legal &amp; General were some of the major companies reporting interim figures Thursday . 
the Paris bourse also advanced , led by French banking stocks which opened higher on the back of rising bond prices . 
by 0945 the CAC-40 index was up around 0.75 percent . 
in Frankfurt leading German stocks were less bullish with dealers saying uncertainty about interest rates and the forthcoming U.S. data was holding things back . 
the dollar was at 1.5095 marks and 109.95 yen compared with late Wednesday &apos;s 1.5079 marks and 110.20 yen . 
the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was 19 points up at 3,924.6 . 
in Paris , the CAC-40 share index was 16.63 points up at 2,054.69 . 
gold fixed at $ 382.20 compared with its London close on Wednesday of 383.65 . 
silver was down two cents at $ 5.08 .
