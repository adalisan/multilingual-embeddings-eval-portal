indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic rarely shows his face in public , but his heavily-armed guards are a fixture in the mountain village which has become a virtual prison for the Bosnian Serb leader . 
the handful of bodyguards he employed as wartime president have expanded into a large security unit clad in black bullet-proof vests and blue berets . 
a sudden NATO raid on Thursday against two war crimes suspects , both loyal to Karadzic , has fuelled the fear and paranoia pervading his headquarters in Pale , 16 km ( 10 miles ) outside Sarajevo . 
when the U.N. war crimes tribunal indicted him two years ago for crimes against humanity , Karadzic scoffed . 
but he has taken increasingly elaborate security precautions in Pale , where he lives and works , and avoided the public appearances he once relished . 
Karadzic , who once gambled in Geneva casinos during peace negotiations , has complained to visitors that he cannot travel because of his fugitive status . 
in pastoral Pale , life went as normal a day after Simo Drljaca -- who formed part of Karadzic &apos;s police apparatus -- was shot dead by British special forces who tried to arrest him . 
the buzz of U.S. combat helicopters flying overhead were a reminder for Karadzic that he could no longer assume NATO peacekeeping troops would tolerate him sabotaging the peace agreement through his covert influence . 
rumours are swirling in Pale that Karadzic only pretends to reside in Pale and is actually staying in a military bunker to the northeast , near the army headquarters . 
Karadzic has taunted NATO in the past , daring the alliance to move against the &quot; 2,000 bodyguards &quot; protecting him . 
bluster aside , swooping on Karadzic would carry a much higher risk of casualties than the operation launched by British special forces in Prijedor on Thursday . 
neither of the suspects targeted in Prijedor were protected by bodyguards . 
if Karadzic is ever extradited , Balkan analysts say he would use the tribunal platform to espouse his extreme nationalist ideology and to portray himself as a martyr . 
journalists in neighbouring Yugoslavia have alleged that agents working for Karadzic &apos;s patron and rival , Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic , would prevent Karadzic &apos;s extradition at any cost to ensure no damaging testimony ever emerged . 
the two men have had a stormy political relationship but have held talks more than once this year in Belgrade . 
as he waits for NATO &apos;s next move , Karadzic is preoccupied with a power struggle against his successor , President Biljana Plavsic , who has accused him of orchestrating &quot; shameful &quot; smuggling rackets . 
thousands of Serbs took to the streets to cheer her allegations of large-scale corruption in Pale and jeer the names of ruling party leaders serving Karadzic . 
judging by his own media network , he is clearly concerned about his fate . 
a week ago , his news agency accused U.S. and British soldiers of plotting to arrest him in a matter of days . 
the United States and its European allies , which once treaded carefully when it came to arresting war crimes suspects , have made clear that Karadzic and other big fish could not assume they would be left alone . 
&quot; I think all who are subject to indictment by the War Crimes Tribunal should be on notice that at some point in time that they will be brought to justice , &quot; U.S. Defence Secretary William Cohen said .
