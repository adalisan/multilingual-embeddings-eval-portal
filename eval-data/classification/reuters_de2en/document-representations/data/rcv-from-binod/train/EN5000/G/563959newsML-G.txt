Israeli police forcibly removed dozens of Jewish settlers holed up in a shack outside a West Bank Jewish settlement on Tuesday , injuring several settler children . 
the settlers had barricaded themselves in the wooden structure after a police bulldozer demolished two other illegally built shacks at the settlement of Yitzhar near the Palestinian town of Nablus . 
police said 18 settlers were arrested and five policemen , three children , and one adult settler were injured . 
Israel Radio said the children were hurt by shards of glass when police burst into the shack . 
&quot; We &apos;ve been arrested . 
the police acted vulgarly and with brutality , &quot; settler leader and Yitzhar resident Yehuda Lievemen told Reuters by cellular phone . 
he said he was in a police van . 
police commander Amikam Harpaz told Israel Radio from the scene : &quot; It was certainly necessary to burst in by force after they refused two opportunities to leave the building voluntarily . 
about 200 troops sent to the scene scuffled with settlers when the first two shacks were destroyed . 
police demolished the third shack after removing those inside . 
Lievemen said his faith in the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who won Israeli elections a year ago championing the settler cause , had evaporated . 
&quot; If we had some hope in the government , today ... we hope this government will fall as quickly as possible , &quot; he said . 
Lieveman said the three structures were built two years ago and served as homes to members of the community . 
but authorities said the shacks were erected several months ago without permits and settlers were warned repeatedly that they were illegal . 
&quot; Orders were issued to halt construction when the shacks were built . 
later the issue was discussed in committee and a decision was made to demolish the structures , &quot; said a spokesman for Israel &apos;s military administration in the West Bank . 
Netanyahu &apos;s government has approved the expansion of several settlements in the West Bank despite Palestinian protests but last week police carted away three mobile homes settlers placed on a West Bank hill in a bid to enlarge their community . 
&quot; It was imperative for our security to build homes on this hill . 
how strange it is that this government suddenly finds it necessary to wreck them , &quot; said Lievemen . 
Israel &apos;s groundbreaking for a new 6,500-unit settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March plunged peacemaking with the Arabs into crisis . 
Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat are to meet on Tuesday evening in an effort to revive peace negotiations . 
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross is to arrive in the region on Wednesday to aid that effort . 
Israel captured the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war . 
more than 130,000 Israelis have settled amidst some two million Palestinians in the areas since then . 
under a framework 1993 peace deal Israel has handed much of the Gaza Strip and some parts of the West Bank to Palestinian rule . 
final peace talks have yet to resume under Netanyahu who took office last June .
