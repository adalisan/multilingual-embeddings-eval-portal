CSCE cocoa futures ended slightly lower in thin dealings Monday , as currency-linked arbitrage selling weighed on the market , dealers said . 
&quot; Arb selling put a damper on the market , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; But it really was an uneventful day , the volume just wasn &apos;t there . 
weakness in the British pound versus the U.S. dollar spurred some selling in favor of cheaper sterling-denominated LIFFE cocoa , traders said . 
the most-active March contract slumped to a low of $ 1,372 , a key support level , but a bout of speculative buying pared losses and helped offset selling pressure from arbritrage , dealers said . 
March delivery ended $ 6 a tonne lower , at $ 1,376 , after ranging between $ 1,381 to $ 1,372 . 
Second-month May also fell $ 6 , to close at $ 1,398 , while the back months finished down $ 6 to $ 9 . 
turnover was thin , at an estimated 3,776 lots . 
after the $ 1,372 mark , traders pegged March &apos;s next support level at $ 1,366- $ 1,362 . 
to the upside , they said March would need to get by $ 1,390 and then $ 1,400 to spark substantial buying interest . 
market participants also look forward to European and U.S. fourth quarter cocoa grind data , a key barometer of cocoa demand , for fresh fundamental impetus . 
European fourth quarter 1996 cocoa grind data is slated to be released this week , followed by U.S. data on January 17 . 
analysts said that while cocoa demand in Europe continues to be healthy , growth in origin processing and a pick-up in grindings at the end of 1995 would leave the 1996 fourth quarter grind flat . 
they expected the Dutch grind to rise by an estimated five percent compared with the fourth quarter last , the UK grind to fall by 10 percent on closure of one of Mars plants and the German grind to fall by about two percent . 
in other news , German cocoa importer keg pegged 1996 / 97 world cocoa output at 2.61 million tonnes , down by seven percent from 95 / 96 , based on its own calculations . 
it forecast a supply deficit of 120,000 tonnes in the 96 / 97 season after an estimated 130,000 tonnes surplus in 95 / 96 .
