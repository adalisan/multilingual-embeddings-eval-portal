the French city of Strasbourg awaits a congress of the extreme-right National Front on Easter weekend with trepidation as politicians squabble over how to halt the anti-immigration party &apos;s relentless rise . 
the leader of the Lower Rhine district council , centre-right senator Daniel Hoeffel , has called for the three-day conference to be banned as a threat to public order . 
Strasbourg &apos;s Socialist mayor , Catherine Trautmann , says she cannot legally ban the congress and has called in national police reinforcements to avert feared clashes between anti-fascist demonstrators and hard-right militants . 
national Front number two Bruno Megret said violence was very likely because &quot; Establishment thugs &quot; were bent on causing trouble . 
he told a news conference the 2,200 delegates would be asked to remain inside the congress centre to avoid incidents . 
Trautmann plans to lead a march against Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen , who has filed a lawsuit against persons unknown for an allegedly conspiracy to disrupt the congress . 
the mayor has had a statue of Joan of Arc , the mediaeval heroine who symbolises national independence , removed from its pedestal outside Strasbourg cathedral to prevent Le Pen using it as a rallying point . 
at least 20,000 demonstrators are expected in the Alsatian capital on the Franco-German border , seat of the European Parliament and the Council of Europe , to protest against what they regard as the Front &apos;s racist and xenophobic ideas . 
the biggest rally is planned for Saturday , the opening day . 
Socialist opposition leader Lionel Jospin , Communist leader Robert Hue , ecologist Greens leader Dominique Voynet and young left-wingers from France , Germany , Belgium and the Netherlands are planning to march . 
national Front vice-president Carl Lang said he was looking forward &quot; to seeing these sons and grandsons of the Nazis and the SS coming to demand the banning of a democratic party &quot; . 
Le Pen has chosen to hold the congress in the region where he won his biggest score in the 1995 presidential election . 
he polled 25 percent in Alsace compared to 15 percent nationwide . 
political scientists differ on the causes of such a strong hard-right vote in a region which has one of the highest living standards and the lowest unemployment rates in France . 
they note that the Front often does best in border areas , where citizens feel more threatened by immigration . 
Alsace has an overspill of Turkish immigrants from neighbouring Germany as well as Arabs from France &apos;s former north African colonies . 
the party also plays to the values of hard work , family , law and order , and patriotism of Alsatians who twice lived under German rule from 1870 to 1918 and from 1940 to 1945 . 
paradoxically , Le Pen registered some of his highest scores in Alsatian villages where there are neither immigrants nor unemployment -- his two key issues . 
France &apos;s mainstream political parties have spent much of the year arguing over how to combat the Front effectively after it captured a fourth southern town in a municipal election . 
the debate often degenerates into a blame game , with the centre-right accusing the Socialists of having opened the doors of television and parliament to Le Pen in the mid-1980s , while the left accuses the conservatives of adopting the Front &apos;s agenda with illiberal immigration laws . 
all sides agree the most effective response would be to bring down France &apos;s record 12.7 percent unemployment , but that seems likely to go on rising in the short term . 
the government has resisted calls to prosecute Le Pen for espousing racial inequality , saying the current law on inciting racial hatred makes a conviction unlikely . 
justice Minister Jacques Toubon has proposed tougher anti-racism legislation , but the centre-right coalition shows no inclination to adopt his bill , which critics say would make a martyr of Le Pen .
