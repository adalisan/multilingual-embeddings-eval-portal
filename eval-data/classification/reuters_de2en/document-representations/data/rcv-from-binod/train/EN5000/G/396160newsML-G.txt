the architect of Boris Yeltsin &apos;s early economic reforms has accused Russia &apos;s government of straying from its liberal course to pander to communist groups , Interfax news agency said on Saturday . 
former acting premier Yegor Gaidar , who launched reforms by freeing prices in 1992 , said the man who replaced him in 1993 , Viktor Chernomyrdin , was pushing the country into crisis by inconsistent policies . 
&quot; The government formed after Boris Yeltsin &apos;s victory in the presidential election last summer had a unique chance to start serious systematic reforms , &quot; Gaidar said . 
&quot; This government will not have such a chance again . 
Gaidar has become increasingly critical of the government since Yeltsin replaced him in 1993 . 
but he remained part of the president &apos;s political camp until December 1994 , when Yeltsin sent troops to quell an independence bid by the southern region of Chechnya . 
Gaidar said the government had failed to tackle a huge budget deficit , a non-payment crisis and wage delays , which have fanned social tensitons in the country 
&quot; The communist majority in the State Duma deliberately maintains a situation where people are not getting their pay , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It is difficult to understand why the government accepts such policy without even trying to resist it . 
&quot; The country can be saved only by replacing the government of &apos; communist confidence &apos; by a responsible reformist government , &quot; he said adding that his party was ready to form such cabinet . 
Gaidar &apos;s Democratic Choice of Russia party formed a strong liberal faction in the State Duma lower house of parliament in 1993-95 . 
but it failed to win any seats in the chamber in December 1995 polls .
