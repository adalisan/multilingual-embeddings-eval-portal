the Czech Republic votes on November 15 and 16 to elect for the first time a 81-member upper house of parliament , the Senate . 
a second round run-off will be held on November 22 and 23 in constituencies where no candidate won more than 50 percent of the vote . 
this will be between the top two candidates from the first round . 
what follows are some key facts about the Senate and its powers . 
the Czech parliament , as set out in the 1993 constitution , comprises the 200-seat lower house called the Chamber of Deputies , and the 81-seat upper house , the Senate . 
the Senate is a supervisory and advisory body in parliament . 
it can draft laws , and will consider laws adopted by the lower house . 
any rejection of a law by the Senate can be overriden by a simple majority of all seats in the lower house . 
senators are elected for a term of six years . 
one third of them are elected every second year , meaning that in some constituencies the initial election this November is for only a two-year or four-year term . 
the length of the mandate was decided by drawing lots . 
every citizen of the Czech Republic aged 18 or over has the right to vote . 
every citizen who is eligible to vote and has reached the age of 40 may be elected to the Senate . 
but no one may be simultaneously a member of both chambers of parliament . 
- If the Chamber of Deputies is dissolved , the Senate will be responsible for adopting legislative measures in matters which cannot be postponed . 
- The Senate cannot adopt legislative measures on matters of the Constitution , the state budget , the state annual account , the election law and international agreements . 
- At a joint session the Senate and the Chamber elects the president of the republic for a five-year term ( this provision was waived in 1993 when only the lower house elected President Vaclav Havel ) . 
- Draft laws on the state budget and a draft state annual account , presented by the government , are discussed only in the Chamber of Deputies and not the Senate . 
- Standard draft laws may be submitted to the lower chamber by lower chamber deputies , the government or collectively by the Senate . 
- The Chamber of Deputies sends draft laws which it has approved to the Senate . 
the Senate must discuss the draft and decide upon a resolution within 30 days . 
- The Senate can either approve the draft , return it in its original form to the lower house , or send it back to the Chamber with draft amendments . 
- If the Senate rejects the draft law , the Chamber votes on it again . 
a draft law is passed if an absolute majority of all deputies approves it . 
- If the Senate fails to act on the lower house &apos;s approved draft within the time limit of 30 days , the draft law is approved . 
- If the Senate returns the draft with draft amendments , the Chamber shall vote on the wording approved by the Senate . 
with its resolution , the draft is passed . 
- If the Chamber fails to pass the draft law in the wording approved by the Senate , it votes again on the version of the draft advanced to the Senate . 
the original draft law can then be approved if it receives an absolute majority of all deputies in the lower house .
