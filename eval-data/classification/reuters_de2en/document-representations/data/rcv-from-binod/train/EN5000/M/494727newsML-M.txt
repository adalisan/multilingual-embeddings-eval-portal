the dollar extended its recent gains in early European business on Tuesday while key stock markets consolidated after a buoyant start to the week . 
the U.S. currency touched a new 56-month peak above 126 yen and five-week highs just short of 1.72 marks , although it later edged back against the mark . 
&quot; There is no real indication that dollar / yen is suffering from fatigue , either in terms of direction or in the extent of its move , &quot; said Paul Meggyesi , senior currency analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
the British pound also held firm , trading at new 4-1 / 2 year highs above its old floor of 2.7780 marks in the European exchange rate mechanism , from which it baled out in September 1992 . 
prospects of higher U.S. interest rates and the start of Japan &apos;s new fiscal year , when new investment decisions are made , are helping to boost the dollar against the yen . 
increasing odds in favour of a single euro currency being launched on time have also helped depress the mark at the expense of the dollar , analysts said . 
but they sounded a note of caution since official comments from Tokyo expressing concern over the dollar &apos;s strength could herald more concrete action to curb it . 
&quot; We have had some jaw-boning from Japanese policy makers already and that is likely to intensify . 
if it does , dollar / yen is unlikely to rise sharply , &quot; said Meggyesi . 
finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a parliamentary committee Japan would deal appropriately with excessive movements in the foreign exchange market . 
Eisuke Sakakibara , director-general of the Tokyo Finance Ministry &apos;s International Finance Bureau , said the authorities would be ready to intervene if necessary . 
&quot; Intervention in the currency markets would be needed to ensure sustainable economic growth if exchange rates were to deviate substantially from economic fundamentals , &quot; he said . 
however , currency markets showed little reaction to news that the German jobless rate dropped to 11.7 percent in March from 12.2 percent in February . 
European bourses largely consolidated their position after Wall Street &apos;s second successive day recovering from fears of higher interest rates helped them revive on Monday . 
the Dow Jones industrial average finished up 29.84 points , or 0.46 percent , at 6,555.91 . 
the London stock market , Europe &apos;s biggest , was barely changed in early business , while the Paris bourse added almost half a percentage point and Frankfurt &apos;s DAX index more than that -- although it was catching up with gains in after-hours trading on Monday . 
on Monday , Frankfurt had gained more than three percent and Paris over two percent as worries over Wall Street &apos;s future moves and interest rates receded . 
London , distracted by concern over higher rates and Britain &apos;s May 1 election , gained a more modest 0.85 percent . 
London share dealers said the potential for more share price gains in London was limited as concern over interest rates , the strength of the pound and the election sends buyers to the sidelines . 
&quot; volumes reflect the concerns about the next major move . 
it &apos;s not surprising that people are sitting on their hands . 
it &apos;s difficult to make long term decisions with so much uncertainty about rates and Labour ( Party ) policies , &quot; one dealer said . 
labour is tipped by opinion polls to win the election after 18 years in opposition . 
German shares were steady near levels reached after the market moved strongly higher in late Monday trading but with no real impetus for further progress despite the strength of the dollar , Frankfurt traders said . 
but French shares climbed on the back of the dollar &apos;s strength and Wall Street &apos;s rise , although Paris traders said solid volume would be needed to maintain gains . 
in Tokyo , meanwhile , Japanese stocks gained around 1.7 percent as the dollar &apos;s gains were expected to improve prospects for exporting companies . 
markets generally were looking ahead to Friday , when U.S. producer prices and retail sales data will give further clues on the timing of the next expected rise in the U.S. interest rates . 
the dollar was quoted around 1.7155 marks and 126.30 yen , up from 1.7082 and 125.73 in late European trade on Monday and compared with highs of 1.7183 and 126.36 . 
the British pound traded around 2.7820 marks , after an earlier high of 2.7915 , compared with a late 2.7815 on Monday . 
gold was fixed in the morning at $ 349.10 an ounce , a little below the previous London close of $ 349.30 . 
silver added three cents to $ 4.83 .
