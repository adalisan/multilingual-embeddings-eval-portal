Merck &amp; Co Inc , claiming exclusive rights to distribute a chicken pox vaccine in the United States and Canada , has sued ( corrects time element ) 
four affiliates of SmithKline Beecham plc to block them from distributing their chicken pox vaccine in the United States . 
Merck is seeking an injunction barring SmithKline from U.S. clinical trials or from subsequent sales of the OKA strain varicella virus , and unspecified damages . 
Merck is asking the Delaware Chancery Court to rule that SmithKline &quot; misappropriated &quot; Merck &apos;s exclusive U.S. rights to the vaccine . 
( corrects court ) 
in court papers , Merck said it received in 1980 exclusive rights through the year 2005 to &quot; know-how &quot; technology developed by the Research Foundation for microbial Diseases of Osaka University . 
that technology is the basis for Merck &apos;s VARIVAX vaccine used to vaccinate &quot; healthy susceptible children and adults &quot; against chicken pox . 
beginning in 1982 , the Research Foundation of Osaka licensed SmithKline to sell the OKA strain varicella vaccine in all countries except the U.S. , Canada , Japan and the Republic of Korea , the lawsuit says . 
Merck claims that in October SmithKline told financial analysts in New York City that following approval expected in early 1997 by the Food and Drug Administration of its OKA vaccine strain , it will begin to distribute the vaccine in the U.S. and Canada . 
Merck said the chicken pox virus hospitalizes 10,000 patients and causes the death of about 100 people each year in the United States .
