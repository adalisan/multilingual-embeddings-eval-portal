one person was killed and three houses set on fire in sporadic violence near the port city of Mombasa overnight , police said on Saturday . 
police could not say whether the incident at Mtwapa , a village 15 kms ( nine miles ) northeast of Mombasa , was linked to an attack three days ago when unidentified assailants killed at least 15 people . 
generally , police said the situation had returned to normal and tension had eased in and around Mombasa but a manhunt for the attackers was still underway . 
residents , however , said they still felt insecure after Wednesday night &apos;s attack -- the latest blow to the government of President Daniel arap Moi in an election year . 
&quot; The government appears incapable of restoring law and order and most people have fled from their homes , &quot; said Nyagah Murano , a resident in the Likoni area south of Mombasa . 
national Police spokesman Peter Kimanthi said on Friday a major security operation , involving police , army and navy units , was underway in the area . 
reinforcements from the crack paramilitary General Service Unit were trucked into the area , which is hilly and has caves where police thought the attackers might be hiding . 
several hundred frightened local residents trekked to shelter at a Roman Catholic church compound in Likoni on Friday , carrying a few belongings on their heads . 
Kimanthi said in Nairobi that six police , five attackers and two civilians were killed during Wednesday &apos;s well-organised night-long raid on police posts in Likoni . 
he said a seventh policeman had died on Thursday and one more civilian had died on Friday . 
&quot; Those are the bodies we have in the mortuary . 
if there are other bodies in the bush we don &apos;t know about them , &quot; said Kimanthi , denying reports that any police had been abducted . 
but a security officer , who declined to be identified , said at least 21 people were killed in the raid and attacks since then , and seven police including three policewomen were missing . 
the security officer told Reuters that four dead civilians were found on Thursday night and two more near Likoni on Friday . 
a total of 43 people have been arrested since the Likoni raid . 
the search operation involving hundreds of men stretched through a tourist haven from Mombasa to the Tanzanian border , but there were no reports of casualties among the thousands of foreign tourists in the area of white coral sand beaches . 
hotel shuttle buses were suspended on Friday and tourists told to stay on hotel property until security was restored . 
scores of attackers armed with machetes seized 28 police issue G-3 rifles and two sub-machineguns on Wednesday and also burned two police posts at Likoni and freed Kenyan prisoners . 
several slogans painted on walls near Matuga pointed to a political motive exacerbated by tribal and land tensions . 
&quot; These are not criminals . 
these are not thugs . 
federalism , &quot; said one . 
&quot; Federalism . 
mainlanders should go to their homes , &quot; said another . 
&quot; Federalism . 
justice and Land , &quot; said a third . 
Moi &apos;s government has been put under pressure since May by an opposition-backed alliance demanding democratic reforms before a general election this year . 
police violently breaking up rallies have rattled investors and tourists . 
Kenya &apos;s central bank appealed on Friday to foreign investors not to quit East Africa &apos;s largest market after the International Monetary Fund halted a key aid package , citing corruption . 
investors pulled out of Kenya &apos;s usually lucrative weekly auction of treasury bills on Thursday because of uncertainty . 
the row with the IMF has hit the shilling currency and jolted investors .
