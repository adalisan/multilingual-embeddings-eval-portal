U.S. peace envoy Bill Richardson is due to meet Zaire &apos;s President Mobutu Sese Seko on Tuesday morning as rebels advance toward the ailing leader &apos;s capital . 
&quot; There can be no military solution to the crisis , but rather a negotiated settlement leading to an inclusive transitional government and fair and free elections , &quot; said Richardson , who arrived in Kinshasa on Monday . 
&quot; I am also here because of our grave concern for the plight of several thousand refugees and displaced Zaireans . 
there is a humanitarian crisis here and the international community must respond . 
international outrage mounted on Monday over the plight of Rwandan Hutu refugees in areas held by rebels . 
fresh reports of refugee deaths filtered out of the northeast of the vast central African country , where rebel leader Laurent Kabila has given aid agencies 60 days to repatriate the Rwandans . 
Kabila &apos;s troops -- accused of driving the refugees into the jungle and aiming for their extermination -- moved nearer to Kinshasa , closing in on Kikwit , 400 km ( 250 miles ) to the east . 
Richardson , in a slight change of plans , is due to fly south late on Tuesday to see Kabila in Lubumbashi , second city and centre of Zaire &apos;s vast mineral riches , and spend the night there . 
a U.S. official in New York said Richardson would go on to rebel-held Kisangani on Wednesday and then fly back to Kinshasa . 
Kabila told Reuters in the eastern city of Goma he hoped Mobutu would make a peaceful exit from Zairean politics but if he did not the rebels could settle the issue by military force . 
thousands of Rwandan Hutus returned to Biaro camp south of Kisangani on Monday , telling of a horrific slaughter that prompted their exodus last week . 
&quot; There was shooting and people were being attacked with knives and machetes . 
it was total panic , &quot; said one man who emerged trembling from the forest as an aid convoy arrived . 
dozens of corpses of those too sick to flee fighting between Hutu refugees , local Zaireans and rebel soldiers lay festering in the camp , 45 km ( 25 miles ) south of Kisangani . 
in Geneva , relief officials said they feared some 50 Hutu children had been killed after they were seized at a hospital in rebel-held Lwiro near the Rwandan border at the weekend . 
the rebels , who took up arms in October in a dispute over nationality for ethnic Tutsis in Zaire , control over half the country . 
Richardson , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , took a strong line over the Hutu refugees , blamed by the rebels for the 1994 genocide of minority Tutsis in Rwanda . 
&quot; There have been some reports of massacres and human rights abuses . 
this must end , &quot; he said . 
&quot; International aid organisations and the United Nations must have immediate access to people in need . 
Kabila agreed on Sunday to give aid agencies access to nearly 100,000 Hutu refugees who fled camps in rebel-held territory when they came under armed attack last week . 
both the United States and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan , who last week described the fate of the refugees as &quot; slow extermination &quot; , rejected Kabila &apos;s 60-day deadline as &quot; unrealistic &quot; . 
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata , who must implement the plan , agreed but said in New York that some refugees could be repatriated by then . 
rebel leaders predict Kinshasa will fall within days . 
army commanders say they will defend it to the death . 
Kikwit residents said government forces had deserted the town . 
&quot; Kikwit is on the point of falling . 
there is no panic and people are calm , &quot; said one resident in radio contact with Kinshasa . 
Mobutu and Kabila have agreed to meet but finding a neutral venue has proved a problem . 
Kabila insists Mobutu should agree either to Zambia or South Africa . 
Mobutu , convalescing after prostate cancer surgery in August , wants a venue closer to home . 
Zaire has accused Zambia of aiding the rebels . 
Gabon has also offered to host the talks . 
Zaire state television said on Monday moves had started in parliament to elect a speaker who could be the constitutional interim successor to Mobutu . 
Mandungu Bula Nyati was endorsed by the steering committees of both the pro-opposition and pro-Mobutu party coalitions in parliament , it said .
