German shares ended weaker on Tuesday after the dollar weakened against the mark following comments by German economic institutes that interest rates may have to rise . 
the IBIS DAX index , which measures all-day computer trade in 30 leading shares , ended at 2,675.50 points , down 27.83 points , or 1.03 percent , was helped off the day &apos;s lows by a slightly firmer opening on Wall Street . 
in floor trade the DAX index reversed gains made on Monday when it had reached above the crucial 2,700 point mark , to end down 30.21 points , or 1.12 percent , at 2,673.62 . 
the dollar dropped below the 1.51-mark level after the country &apos;s six leading economic research institutes said German interest rates may need to rise if money supply growth remained above target levels . 
several dealers said they were not sure where the German share market would head next and suggested a correction down as far as the 2,620 point level could still be necessary if the DAX index was to make any real advances . 
but they said direction would be likely to come from the U.S. for the rest of the week as a stream of data is released . 
dealers complained of thin trading and said a public holiday in parts of Germany on Friday could also limit volumes for the rest of the week . 
chemical company BASF AG was the most heavily traded stock of the day , ending IBIS dealings at 48.85 marks , down 15 pfennigs , but firmer than the market trend and the rest of the chemical sector , with dealers saying a large buy order had supported the stock .
