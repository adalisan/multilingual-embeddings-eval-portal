Anthony Lake , President Bill Clinton &apos;s choice to head the CIA , was reportedly weighing a decision on whether to withdraw his nomination for the position after three days of tough hearings on Capitol Hill . 
NBC-TV &apos;s &quot; nightly News &quot; and ABC-TV &apos;s &quot; World News tonight , &quot; quoting unnamed White House sources , said Lake visited the White House and spoke with Clinton personally on Monday , a day before the congressional hearings resume . 
the often-testy Senate confirmation hearings have highlighted continued problems for Lake &apos;s nomination and ABC said Lake was concerned the assault on his integrity , management skills and fitness to head the Central Intelligence Agency would simply continue unabated . 
ABC quoting its sources as saying they did not expect any surprising new revelations about Lake . 
tough questioning in Lake &apos;s confirmation hearings could signal trouble when his nomination reaches the Republican-controlled Senate floor , even assuming that two of the panel &apos;s 10 Republicans join the nine Democrats , as seems likely , to recommend confirmation by the full Senate . 
but ABC said the sources were uncertain whether Lake was leaning toward withdrawing his name from the nomination . 
the White House has publicly stood by Lake &apos;s nomination . 
no comment was immediately available from the White House .
