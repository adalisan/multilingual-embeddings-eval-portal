the key September 10-year Japanese government bond futures contract was slightly higher at midday on Friday , buoyed by lacklusture Tokyo share prices and scattered buying of cash bonds , traders said . 
the release of the Economic Planning Agency &apos;s monthly economic report had little impact , as many market players are now firmly entrenched in their view that the Bank of Japan will not be able to raise interest rates immediately , they said . 
&quot; The market now feels that the BOJ will not be able to make any change at least until the next tankan survey , &quot; said a trader for a foreign brokerage house . 
September JGBs stood at 124.97 at midday , up slightly from Thursday &apos;s close of 124.89 . 
turnover was 14,331 contracts . 
declines in short-term interest rates were also supportive for JGBs , traders said . 
&quot; Euroyen futures have been firm today , due to buying by city banks , &quot; the trader for a foreign brokerage house said . 
city banks were also detected buying fixed interest rates in the interest rate swap market , which also boosted JGBs , said a trader for a city bank &apos;s securities unit . 
lending rates for the 4.6 percent 174th 10-year JGB , which is the cheapest to deliver ( CTD ) cash issue for the September were up this morning , a foreign bank trader said . 
earlier , traders said an agricultural financial institution had a large amount of the 174th at its disposal , after having conducted aggressive target buying of the CTD issue since around March and April . 
the agricultural financial institution &apos;s large holdings had decreased the supply of the 174th issue in the market , and caused the lending rate for the issue to rise , the foreign bank trader said . 
traders said , however , that a short-squeeze of the 174th issue was unlikely , as it was a former benchmark bond with a large issue amount . 
in the afternoon , JGBs will have a hard time breaking convincingly above the morning high of 125.09 unless fresh buy factors emerge , traders said . 
&quot; I was a bit surprised that the September rose above 125.05 , but even then it &apos;s rise was stalled at 125.09 . 
even if the key contract manages to break above 125.09 in the afternoon , I think it will have a tough time rising beyond 125.20 , &quot; the first trader said .
