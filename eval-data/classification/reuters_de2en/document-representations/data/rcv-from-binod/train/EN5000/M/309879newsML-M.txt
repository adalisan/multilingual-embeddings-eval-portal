U.S. West Coast wholesale product prices were lower Tuesday amid reports showing a build in regional gasoline inventories , traders said . 
sellers lowered spot prices early to try to draw out buyers waiting on Tuesday &apos;s inventory data . 
the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) , a Washington D.C. -based trade group , showed West Coast supplies of gasoline rose 623,000 barrels last week to 29.5 million barrels . 
traders said inventories built at supply terminals because poor weather in recent weeks has lowered motorist demand . 
CARB grade diesel oil in L.A. stayed 73 / 74.50 cents after trimming a half cent early , traders said . 
San Francisco gasoline remained two cents under L.A. prices as demand remained static after heavy rains early this month .
