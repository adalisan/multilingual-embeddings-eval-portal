President Jerry Rawlings , who has dominated national life in Ghana for almost two decades , was sworn in on Tuesday for a second and final two-year term . 
Rawlings , a former air force officer who staged two successful coups , chalked up a historic poll victory last month to become the first incumbent to be re-elected since the West African nation &apos;s independence in 1957 . 
Members of parliament elected in the same December 7 poll were also sworn in at the colourful ceremony . 
foreign guests included Nigerian military ruler General Sani Abacha and African American Black Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan .
