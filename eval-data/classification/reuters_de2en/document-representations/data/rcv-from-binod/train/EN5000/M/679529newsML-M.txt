European stocks closed with sharp losses on Monday , plagued by domestic worries , but the dollar gained nearly a yen after soothing noises from the weekend summit of industrialised nations helped ease U.S.-Japan trade friction . 
the U.S. currency was stronger because dealers were relieved that fears of a Washington-Tokyo row over Japan &apos;s big trade surplus proved unfounded at the summit of the Group of Seven ( G7 ) nations in Denver . 
but European equity markets had a bad day with only Paris managing to squeeze into the plus column at the close . 
the gloom was not alleviated by Wall Street which fell 0.7 percent shortly after opening . 
London was down one percent at one stage , dogged by fears of higher interest rates and pre-budget nerves , while Frankfurt closed with steep losses after investors took profits from last week &apos;s record-breaking run . 
London , however , closed only 0.4 percent down after recovering some poise . 
it earlier tumbled by 46.9 points to 4,547.0 on the blue-chip FTSE index as worries over sterling &apos;s strength added to the market &apos;s woes and depressed the futures market . 
&quot; The futures have been hammered again today and that &apos;s pulled the FTSE lower , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; It seems the market just can &apos;t get over its worries about rates and the budget and we just keep on going down . 
London has now ended lower for six straight sessions and has fallen continuously since hitting a closing high of 4,783.1 on June 13 . 
dealers blame the growing expectations of interest rate rises and concern about the possible abolition of tax breaks on dividends for pension funds in the July 2 budget . 
&quot; The market needs to find its floor and that could still be a couple of hundred points below our current level , &quot; said Nomura stock strategist Nick Knight . 
investors were also counting the cost of the pound &apos;s 59-month high against the German mark . 
it &apos;s strength is hurting currency-sensitive stocks , such as British Steel plc , which was at almost 10 pence down at 148 1 / 2p near the close . 
in Frankfurt , floor trade ended down 0.9 percent on profit-taking after the 30-share DAX index hit an all-time trading high on Friday of 3 , 798.94 points . 
After-hours trading on the computersed IBIS index fared worse and closed down over one percent , gaining no help from Wall Street . 
&quot; Everything seems to be going against the DAX right now , &quot; said one Frankfurt trader . 
&quot; It &apos;s been very quiet today . 
there &apos;s no reason for the rally to continue right now . 
in Paris , stocks were slightly ahead at the cose after slipping in and out of profit in quiet trade for most of the day . 
&quot; There &apos;s no news , nothing going on , &quot; a broker said . 
on the foreign exchange market , the dollar vaulted 115 yen in early European trade on the strength of the more optimistic sentiment after the G7 summit and finished the day still clasping most of its gains . 
&quot; Dollar / yen has been strong ... it &apos;s been that way since people realised that the US-Japan trade issue had not really been in the limelight at the G7 , &quot; said one trader at a Japanese bank here . 
&quot; The theme today has been whether dollar / yen can keep its gains and establish a foothold above 115 . 
but getting to 116 yen is looking difficult , &quot; he said . 
the dollar was quoted at 115.30 yen in late European trade , off its session high at 115.67 but well above its late Friday levels of 114.58 . 
many dealers had expected Washington to use the G7 meeting in Denver as a forum to criticise Tokyo over Japan &apos;s growing trade surplus , but the summit barely mentioned currencies , and differences were played down . 
analysts said that G7 meeting turned out to be something of a non-event as far as the markets were concerned and the market would now turn its attention to the Bank of Japan &apos;s quarterly &quot; tankan &quot; , a closely watched survey of corporate sentiment , due out late on Tuesday . 
the dollar was at 1.7213 marks and 115.29 yen , compared with 1.7298 and 114.58 in late European trade on Friday . 
gold closed at $ 338.90 against $ 338.45 at the close on Friday . 
silver was up four cents at $ 4.79 in late trade .
