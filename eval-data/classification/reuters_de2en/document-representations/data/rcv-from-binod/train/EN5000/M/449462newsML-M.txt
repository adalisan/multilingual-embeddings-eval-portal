news of a fall in metals stocks on Tuesday failed to dispel a wave of gloom in the London market that sent industrial metals prices spiralling lower . 
and in the soft commodity markets , a rally in cocoa was overshadowed by a five percent plunge in London coffee futures , although this was corrected after a strong New York open . 
base metals on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) , dogged by a lack of stamina on Monday , suffered setbacks when falls in warehouse stocks failed to spark follow-through buying . 
aluminium , hit by speculative selling , sank below $ 1,650 per tonne on the LME despite a stock decline of 6,100 tonnes , while copper lingered at the bottom of its price range after failing to gather momentum from a 3,800 tonne stock fall . 
LME traders said both metals were victims of sagging sentiment after recent attempts to break into higher ground fell through . 
three-month aluminum crumbled to a close of $ 1,640 per tonne , compared to $ 1,668 on Monday . 
and copper futures , which bounced around low levels on Monday , ended $ 14 lower at $ 2,330 per tonne . 
zinc also felt the pressure of market pessimism . 
it failed to sustain Monday &apos;s glowing performance and finished lower at $ 1,289 per tonne , ignoring a 2,650 tonne inventory fall . 
lead bucked the weak trend in late LME trading to revisit Monday &apos;s high of $ 710 , and close just below it . 
&quot; Most of the metals have done very well over the past weeks and months and a correction is overdue , &quot; said an LME trader . 
precious metals also suffered setbacks after a wave of speculative selling swept the market . 
gold eased nearly $ 5 to $ 345.30 an ounce , the lowest this month , deepening losses posted late on Monday although it moved higher in later trading . 
gold prices had recovered to $ 365 from a three-year low of $ 336.00 over the past month , as funds reduced near-record net short positions . 
but palladium and platinum were worst hit by what dealers called an unexpected move in an already nervous market . 
palladium plunged $ 9.75 to end at $ 142.00 , while platinum fell sharply to close down $ 8.25 at $ 371.00 per tonne . 
&quot; There &apos;s nothing fundamental that I can see to warrant this sell-off , &quot; said a senior dealer . 
&quot; It &apos;s likely a technical move in a thin market with not a lot of buying around . 
soft commodities were mixed , as coffee extended a tumble , fuelling speculation its spectacular three month rally has come to a halt and then yo-yoed up after New York opened to end up $ 8 . 
speculative selling pulled prices sharply lower , and although traders said trade buying cushioned the fall , benchmark robusta for May fell 4.7 percent , at one point touching $ 1,610 per tonne . 
but New York &apos;s rebound from steep overnight losses spurred a recovery in London robusta a close of $ 1,698 . 
broker GNI said recent retail price hikes by U.S. and European retailers could have dampened the rally which has led bean prices 50 percent higher since the start of the year . 
traders said further losses could be in the pipeline if roasters finish rebuilding low stocks and consumers resist the higher supermarket prices . 
but bulls insisted coffee could climb back up again based on sound supply fundamentals . 
one said arabica type coffee would remain in tight supply after origin sellers sold heavily to cash in on the high prices of the past few weeks . 
the cocoa market stayed buoyant all day , seemingly oblivious to the general trend , and London prices at one point climbed to a new seven-month high . 
may cocoa closed up three at 1,032 pounds sterling a tonne . 
analysts said a shift of fund investment from coffee to cocoa could be a driving force , but added that an extended cocoa rally was unlikely . 
wood was unusually pushed into the limelight by a bullish U.S. Housing starts Report . 
lumber futures soared on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after the housing data showed February starts well above expectations . 
the May contract jumped by the daily limit of $ 10.00 per tbf to trade at $ 371.60 . 
and the picture was also brighter in the crude oil market , where Brent futures extended afternoon gains after fund buying pushed up New York prices .
