Pakistan stocks , which had opened higher , sagged at noon on Tuesday as blue chips tumbled on settlement day , dealers said . 
&quot; Foreign funds and institutions that sparked last month &apos;s rally are on the sidelines and weak holders are squaring their positions today , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; The index will slip further as there is little support from major players . 
the index fell 21.87 points , or 1.16 percent , to 1,865.77 at noon . 
losers led gainers 179 to 18 .
