the United Nations has appointed a new humanitarian coordinator for Iraq to replace Italian Gualtero Fulcheri , the U.N. office in Baghdad said on Thursday . 
&quot; Staffan de Mistura , of Sweden , was appointed United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq , &quot; it said in a statement . 
the office of the humanitarian coordinator will be responsible for checking that food and medicine bought by Iraq , under its &quot; oil-for-food &quot; deal with the United Nations , are distributed equitably among Iraqis . 
under the deal which was put into effect in December Iraq is allowed to sell $ 2 billion worth of oil over six months to buy food and medicine for its population , suffering from U.N. sanctions imposed for its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 . 
no food or medical supplies have yet reached the country . 
prior to his appointment , de Mistura , 50 , was director of public affairs division at the United Nations Children Fund in New York . 
he also worked with U.N. humanitarian operations in northern Iraq , Rwanda , Albania , Sudan and Ethiopia .
