Indian shares took a pounding on Tuesday as news of the U.S. missile attack on Iraq caught the market napping after prices opened higher , brokers said . 
&quot; That was the only reason for the crash , &quot; said Kamlesh Sanghavi , director at Sanghavi Savla Stock brokers Ltd . &quot; People were taken by surprise . 
the 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange ended 78.30 points , or 2.20 percent , down at 3,484.68 after rising to 3,586.89 in early trade . 
the Delhi share index index closed 17.91 points , or 2.2 percent , lower at 789.68 . 
traders said the tumble was a &quot; knee-jerk &quot; reaction to the Middle-East crisis . 
&quot; The initial reaction was bad . 
we should see some discounting in a couple of days when the fears recede , &quot; said Ram Mohan at Lloyds brokerage . 
the setback came after the market started strongly in anticipation of a crucial speech by Chidambaram in parliament about 1996 / 97 ( April-March ) budget proposals . 
shortly before close Chidambaram put off his statement because of a disruption in parliament , and brokers said they were disappointed but hopeful . 
the 50-stock National Stock Exchange index dropped 14 points to 1,037 with the net traded value at 12.44 billion rupees in 66.39 million shares . 
the Calcutta index shed 5.07 points to 451.09 and the Madras index 15.72 points to 3,501.42 .
