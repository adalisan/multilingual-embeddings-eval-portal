Robusta futures in London closed slightly higher on industry short-covering helped partly by an upsurge of arabica prices in New York . 
November added $ 9 to close at $ 1,510 . 
January also ended $ 9 higher at $ 1,410 per tonne . 
in New York arabica futures climbed to their highest level in nearly three months , buoyed by persistent concerns about prompt supplies . 
a late harvest in Central America due to heavy rainfall , coupled with a recent truckers &apos; strike in Colombia , delayed shipments of the new 1996 / 97 crop to key consuming countries , traders said . 
faced with shrinking inventories , coffee roasters have been forced to pay steep premiums on prompt parcels to meet processing needs with European roasters outbidding their US counterparts . 
the tightness is not likely to be alleviated for several weeks , if not until the end of the year . 
Vietnam - Vietnam &apos;s new robusta harvest is being dogged by high moisture levels in the coffee beans after heavy rains and this is making drying and transportation difficult . 
the moisture level in the beans reaches 20 per cent when it should only be at 13 per cent . 
ACPC - Jorge Cardenas , head of Colombia &apos;s Association of Coffee producing Countries said , that there may be possible changes in the ACPC export retention scheme . 
however , he did not elaborate on changes in the plan agreed last May , when ACPC member countries agreed to limit green coffee exports to 53.5 million 60-kg bags in 1996 / 97 ( July / June ) against 45.8 million bags the previous year . 
but he stressed the need to regulate supply during the first half of 1997 arguing that there is more coffee available during the first three to five months of the year because of crop flows . 
he said the objective should be to harmonize that flow , to adjust it to real demand and not allow prices to fall as a result of supply pressures . 
however , traders said that no price influencing decisions can be expected at the forthcoming meeting of the ACPC technical group in Costa Rica this weekend . 
Zimbabwe - According to official sources coffee production in Zimbabwe in 1996 / 97 ( April / March ) can be estimated at 192,000 60-kg bags up from 64,000 bags in 1995 / 96 and 157,000 bags in 1994 / 95 . 
however , the 1995 / 96 production figure seems to be at odds with the export figures as reported by the ICO . 
the ICO has put 1995 / 96 exports at 116,000 bags up from 98,000 bags the previous year . 
Japan - Japan imported 498,024 bags of coffee in September 1996 , 13 per cent more than was imported the same month the previous year . 
that brought total imports since the beginning of 1996 up to 4.193 million bags , slightly up on last year &apos;s figure of 4.177 million bags . 
total imports in calendar year 1995 dropped sharply by 12 per cent to 5.324 million bags . 
major suppliers of green coffee in January / September 1996 were Brazil ( 720,000 vs 925,400 bags ) , Colombia ( 895,600 vs 722,800 bags ) and Vietnam ( 178,300 vs 234,900 bags ) .
