Asian investors saw only gloom on the horizon on Monday after the Dow &apos;s 33-point fall on Friday and growing fears of higher interest rates in the United States , dealers said . 
most Asian markets ended the day lower , with Tokyo &apos;s Nikkei index barely holding above key 20,000 point level as trading centred on speculative , incentive-backed shares . 
bourses in Kuala Lumpur , Singapore and Bangkok also fell , with Thai shares finishing nearly 1.5 percent down . 
only Bombay ended strongly higher , ending up 1.42 percent to a provisional 3,564.46 points , driven by hopes Indian Finance Minister Chidambaram would offer incentives to retail and institutional investors , traders said . 
in Tokyo , the 225-issue benchmark Nikkei lost 59.79 points , or 0.30 percent , to close at 20,107.11 . 
its September futures shed 20 points to settle at 20,150 . 
&quot; The Nikkei average was in a tug-of-war state for most of the day near the 20,000 level , &quot; said Harushige Kobayashi , deputy general manager at Yamaichi Securities . 
brokers said there was ample buying interest near the 20,000 line , preventing the Nikkei , battered by small-lot selling , from crashing below it in the afternoon . 
Nomura Securities strategist Masanobu Kaizu said there was still a chance that it may slip to the 19,500 level soon . 
Hong Kong stocks were hit by fears of higher interest rates , but prices were off their lows by the close as bargain-hunters stepped in around support levels , analysts said .

&quot; Interest rates are the main concern right now - the market fell on rising interest rate concerns but volume was thin , &quot; said Antony Mak , sales director at Vickers Ballas . 
any rise in interest rates in the United States is usually followed by a rates rise in the territory . 
on Friday , mounting evidence of a booming U.S. economy intensified Wall Street &apos;s fears of a near-term credit tightening by the Federal Reserve , news which unnerved Hong Kong investors on Monday . 
in Bangkok , Thai stocks fell 1.46 percent in thin trade in line with declines on Wall Street and on regional markets earlier in the day , brokers said . 
&quot; Market sentiment was poor due to a sharp fall on Wall Street on Friday and other regional markets on Monday .

in London , the dollar was trading at 109.04 / 09 yen and 1.4820 / 30 marks at 1100 GMT , up from late Friday &apos;s levels of 108.57 / 67 yen and 1.4772 / 82 marks . 
trade was quiet with U.S. markets closed for the Labor Day holiday and a lack of news to trade on .
