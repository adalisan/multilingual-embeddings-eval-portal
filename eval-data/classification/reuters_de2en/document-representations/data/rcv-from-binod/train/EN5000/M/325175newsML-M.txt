the start of a new account was expected to give another boost to Belgian stocks on Thursday , but dealers were mixed on whether the 14-day trading period would prove positive overall . 
the account ends on February 11 . 
&quot; It &apos;s very difficult to get a good grip on things . 
the only thing is certain is that there &apos;s good volatility , &quot; said one trader . 
if the dollar continued to rise , so would Belgian shares , but if it came off , gains would prove shortlived , he said . 
another trader said , however , he remained positive about the overall trend . 
&quot; I would say we will be up ( on Feb 11 ) , &quot; he said . 
the Bel-20 Index ended Wednesday up 22.70 points , or 1.12 percent , at 2,047.67 points , a new record closing high . 
the Index also set a new all-time high of 2,056.75 points mid-session . 
the index started the account on January 3 at 1,871.05 points . 
the Brussels Stock Exchange &apos;s wider market indices also ended at new record closing levels . 
volume overall on the bourse was a hefty 4.79 billion Belgian francs . 
early weakness in New York , where losses in IBM pulled down the Dow Jones .DJI , was ignored . 
&quot; It remains to be seen if the downturn in IBM impacts other stocks , &quot; one trader said . 
the star Bel-20 issue was retailer Colruyt , which rose 550 francs , or 3.85 percent , to 14,850 francs , although in moderate volume . 
volume leader was rival retailing group GIB , up 60 francs , or 3.83 percent , to 1,625 francs . 
dealers said the stock continued to draw attention following news Tuesday of plans to sell its Sarma clothes chain and a report on Wednesday it also wanted to dispose of its hypermarket units . 
electronics group Barco was also active , rising 200 francs , or 3.78 percent , to 5,490 francs as the market welcomed news earlier in the week of a U.S. acquisition .
