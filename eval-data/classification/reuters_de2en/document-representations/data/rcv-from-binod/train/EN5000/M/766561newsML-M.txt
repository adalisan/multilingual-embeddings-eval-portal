Brady bond prices were mixed as spreads widened slightly against U.S. treasuries , backing off their flirtation with new record levels , emerging market traders said . 
the emerging debt market has clung to stunning tight levels for the past few weeks , watching the JP Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index-plus rise 3.7 percent in July , as players held onto their positions . 
&quot; spreads are very tight and that &apos;s something we &apos;ve got to live with until something corrects , &quot; said Peter Allen , director of emerging market research at BankBoston . 
in sparce trade on Wednesday the overall EMBI index widened about one basis point to 373 , dealers said . 
the benchmark U.S. Treasury bond had a banner day , climbing 26 / 32 to yield 6.33 percent on technical factors . 
&quot; The long bond is the main driver of momentum in this market , &quot; said one Brady bond trader , noting that Wall Street dealers seemed reluctant to add to their hefty stockpiles of emerging debt . 
in the major Latin American issues , the liquid Brazil 
&quot; C &quot; bond gained 3 / 8 to a bid price of 84 and Mexican pars edged up 1 / 4 to 82-3 / 8 . 
U.S. analysts looked to high yield paper to lead the market , as Ecuadorean Bradies stormed higher . 
Ecuador &apos;s PDIs tightened about nine basis points to 71-1 / 2 , while the country &apos;s par bonds picked up around 12 basis points to 54-7 / 8 . 
&quot; In the very short term the high yielders -- Ecuador Russia and Bulgaria -- will continue to outperform , &quot; said Carlos Asilis , Latin American strategist at UBS Securities . 
&quot; Credit conditions continued to be benevolent and global liquidity continues to be very positive , &quot; Asilis added . 
the markets reacted warmly to the announcement late Tuesday that the Brazil government named Gustavo Franco to replace Gustavo Loyola as head of the central bank . 
analysts said that Franco , an architect of the country &apos;s stabilization plan , would hold the line on foreign exchange policy . 
&quot; In my view it didn &apos;t amount to much because the market had been expecting the departure of Loyola for a long time , &quot; Asilis said . 
BankBoston &apos;s Allen also expressed confidence in Franco : &quot; He &apos;s now central bank president so he speaks with more authority . 
he may have more influence on non central bank issues , &quot; Allen said .
