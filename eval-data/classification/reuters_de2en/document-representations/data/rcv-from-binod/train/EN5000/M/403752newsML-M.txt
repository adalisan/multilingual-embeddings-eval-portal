palm oil prices were little changed at the close of the European vegetable oil market on Wednesday , but traders said the material was looking vulnerable . 
traders said a slowdown in export business coupled with a faster-than-expected pickup in output after the holidays in Malaysia seem to be signalling a fall in prices . 
&quot; Palm oil has been overpriced for some time now and people now seem to be losing confidence , &quot; said one trader . 
others said palm oil was at too high a premium over soy oil and needed to have a downward correction . 
&quot; We are not going to see a sudden shakeout in the market , but I feel that prices will set back gently in the coming weeks , &quot; said another trader . 
traders said the only thing that could stop palm oil prices coming down was a sustained run of high prices in Chicago , but this seemed unlikely with the south American soybean crop becoming available . 
in his latest crop estimate Malaysian private forecaster Ivan Wong put local production for end-February at 455,000 tonnes , 21 percent down from January . 
stocks were estimated at 595,000 tonnes against 696,272 in January while exports were projected at 465,000 to 470,000 tonnes . 
traders said the report should have been bullish for the market but due to the current slowness in exports and the pick up in production it had no impact . 
crude palm oil CIF Europe closed $ 2.50 to $ 5 up while products were unchanged to $ 2.50 down with no further business reported . 
coconut oil sellers were $ 2.50 down after Feb / Mar traded at $ 770 , Mar / APR at $ 760 , APR / May at $ 752.50 and May / Jun at $ 750 a tonne CIF . 
Palmkernel oil closed $ 5 to $ 2.50 lower in a tradeless market . 
a volatile dollar kept trading in soft oil to a minimum with close prices in soy oil unchanged and rape oil one to 0.50 guilders higher . 
soy oil traded at 99 guilders a 100 kilos for Mar while 101 guilders was paid for May / Jul and Aug / Oct rape oil . 
Nov / Jan rape oil fetched 102 and 102.25 guilders , but traders said there was little volume behind the business .
