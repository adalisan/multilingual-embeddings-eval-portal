Dubai gold traders on Sunday reported the first signs of a seasonal easing in bullion demand from the Indian subcontinent amid continued subdued local retail jewellery interest . 
they said the wedding season in India , the world &apos;s single biggest gold market , was starting to wind down . 
this , coupled with the Moslem Muharram period , was beginning to put downward pressure on business , they said . 
&quot; India and Pakistan are pretty dull because it is the Muharram season , which is a sad time , so there is not too much buying , &quot; said one trader . 
Muharram is considered by some Moslems to be one of the faith &apos;s holiest months and a period of reflection , even mourning . 
&quot; Demand should pick up after Muharram is over , but then the wedding season will be over too , which is not good news for sales , &quot; said another . 
but one trader said any good early rains in India might fan gold demand . 
&quot; Any early indication of a good monsoon might be a fillip for the market , &quot; he said . 
on the local retail market , business continued slow in the wake of a month-long , government-sponsored shopping promotion which closed at the end of April . 
&quot; The local retail sector has been very slow since the shopping festival . 
everyone has already made their gold purchases pretty much for the whole year , &quot; said one trader . 
but another trader expected local retail sales to pick up ahead of the summer holidays when many expatriates buy gold to give as presents to family back home . 
&quot; Demand is going to start picking up because people will buy gold to take home for their families , &quot; he said . 
another said he thought expatriates had probably already done their summer gold shopping . 
prices in Dubai dropped in the week , mirroring a fall in international bullion after Germany said it would revalue the Bundesbank &apos;s gold reserves , dealers said . 
on Thursday German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said Bundesbank reserves would be revalued . 
this would help Germany qualify for European economic and monetary union by generating windfall profits . 
in line with the $ 3.50 fall in world gold prices , the price of Dubai &apos;s benchmark ten tola bar dropped to 4,763 dirhams ( $ 1,298 ) from 4,810 dirhams a week earlier . 
the ten tola bar is 3.746 ounces of 24 carat gold . 
on the international spot market , gold was last quoted on Saturday at $ 344.30 / 80 an ounce from $ 347.80 / $ 348.30 a week earlier .
