European Union Commissioner Karel Van Miert said on Saturday Britain &apos;s new prime minister Tony Blair was a pragmatic man who should be able to play an important role in Europe . 
Blair &apos;s Labour party swept to a resounding victory in Britain &apos;s general election on Thursday , ending 18 years of rule by John Major &apos;s Conservatives , who had been deeply split over policy on Europe . 
&quot; I think Tony Blair is a man in the good British tradition of pragmatism , so he has integrated into his team people with different sensitivities but a team which it seems ... will allow him to play an important role at the heart of the European Union , &quot; Van Miert told Belgian RTBF radio . 
to play this role &quot; they must not be negative like the Conservatives have been for too long , &quot; he added . 
&quot; You have to be positive , so have to know also how to make concessions , be among the leading runners . 
there is ... a hope , on the way , that Tony Blair will become one of the important leaders of Europe , &quot; he said . 
however , he added , &quot; one mustn &apos;t get carried away , one mustn &apos;t expect miracles &quot; . 
van Miert , a Belgian , recalled the late Socialist French President Francois Mitterrand who led his country for 14 years and was praised at his funeral last year as a tireless promoter of European unity . 
&quot; Let &apos;s not forget that at the beginning Mitterand wasn &apos;t especially pro-European either . 
it &apos;s only along the way , in the light of experience that ... it turned out that way . 
new British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said on Friday one of his priorities was to improve relations with the EU . 
these plummeted last year after the 15-nation bloc slapped an export ban on British beef exports amid fears that mad cow disease could spread to humans .
