Cuba &apos;s ruling Communist Party said on Wednesday it was in favour of greater internal democracy but it should not threaten national unity and democratic centralism would remain its guiding principle . 
the Cuban party said in an analysis published in the party newspaper Granma that it would not renounce &quot; the principle of Democratic centralism , &quot; which is traditionally an ideological pillar of Communist Party states . 
this was a clear message that the leadership remained committed , despite increasing foreign pressure , to preserving its existing one-party political system . 
but the document said this commitment did not contradict the need for &quot; an ever greater democracy within the body of the party . 
it defined this as &quot; all the space necessary for the expression of ideas , proposals , opinions , whether they coincide or disagree , about any issue , however polemic or complicated . 
but the document , which was being published in daily instalments by Granma , went on to say that there could be no room for &quot; tendencies which weaken the discipline and political activity of the party . 
&quot; It added that this encouragement of internal democracy &quot; cannot be allowed to threaten the essential unity of our existence as an independent nation . 
the need for unity in the face of external hostility , particularly from Cuba &apos;s ideological enemy the United States , was one of the arguments regularly used by President Fidel Castro to explain why his government continued to reject the idea of Western-style multi-party democracy . 
Cuban authorities , invoking the island &apos;s constitution and laws , which defend the existence of a one-party state , treat internal political opposition groups as illegal and often persecute their members , accusing them of being &quot; counter-revolutionaries &quot; in the service of the United States . 
the Cuban government last week revoked the visa of a U.S. diplomat at the U.S. 
interests Section in Havana , accusing her of actively supporting and organising Cuban dissident groups . 
Washington denied this and expelled a Cuban diplomat in reply . 
the analysis document said the aim of U.S. policy was still the destruction of the &quot; Cuban Revolution &quot; -- official Cuban shorthand for the island &apos;s one-party socialist system . 
it also said religious values , when honestly put into practice , were good for the country and its people . 
this reflected a policy of greater tolerance toward religion adopted by the ruling party in recent years , a contrast to the overt hostility and suspicion that marked church-state relations immediately after the 1959 revolution .
