Southeast Asian rubber markets shook off news of the death of Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping on Thursday , with dealers saying the market will only be affected by changes in Beijing &apos;s economic policies . 
the Singapore rubber market was untraded by midday and Malaysian prices were little changed , while those in Indonesia were stable in quiet trade . 
&quot; It &apos;s hardly a surprise , &quot; the chief rubber trader at a North American commodity company told Reuters . 
&quot; He &apos;s been dead politically for five years . 
if there is a smooth transfer of power , it shouldn &apos;t have any impact . 
we know the market has stayed the way it is ever since rumours about his failing health spread , &quot; said one trader in Indonesia . 
regional dealers said the rubber trade may react if China , which is one of the top buyers in the market , announced a drastic shift in economic policy . 
&quot; There is potential for a short-term bearish impact if there is a power struggle in China . 
( but ) the probability must be very low , &quot; a senior trader said . 
&quot; For now , I &apos;m not seeing any kind of impact in the market . 
in fact , the whole trade is rather dull , &quot; another dealer for a Singapore-based Japanese rubber trading firm said . 
&quot; News about Chinese buying used to shock the market and lift the price . 
but not anymore now , &quot; said an Indonesian trader . 
most orders are directly organised by Beijing and carried out by factories through a handful of official channels . 
traders said the Indonesian market was quiet because of the absence of buyers , mostly from the United States and Europe . 
the SIR20 March price was stable at 54.50 U.S. cents a lb fob Medan and Surabaya , unchanged from Wednesday &apos;s levels . 
in Palembang , offer prices were unchanged at 54.20 cents and at 54.00 cents a lb in Padang but levels rose 0.25 cents in Jambi to 54.00 cents a lb . 
in Pontianak , offer prices were unchanged at 53.75 cents a lb . 
in Malaysia , rubber business was very quiet and Deng &apos;s death was not a factor as the market has been in the doldrums in recent months due to weak consumer demand . 
&quot; There has already been talk that rubber imports by China will slow down this year due to financial contraints . 
I think they will stick to their buying programme for the year , &quot; said a Malaysian trader . 
China imported 69,437 tonnes or rubber from Malaysia in the first 10 months of 1996 . 
traders said the Malaysian market is likely to remain under pressure as producers still have large stocks to clear . 
by midday , the benchmark March RSS1 was quoted at Malaysian 304.50 Malaysian cents a kg , unchanged from Wednesday &apos;s close .
