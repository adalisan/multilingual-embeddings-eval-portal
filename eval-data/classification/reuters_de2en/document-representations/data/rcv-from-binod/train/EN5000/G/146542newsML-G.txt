Turkish team Altay on Monday called on sports officials to act against &quot; freeloaders &quot; who get into big matches by stealing tickets , breaking the turnstiles or being let in by friends working at the stadium . 
Altay chairman Erdinc Altinyeleklioglu told the Anatolian news agency his club had lost billions of lira ( thousands of dollars ) after 60,000 people watched the Izmir team &apos;s weekend tie against league leaders Galatasaray although only 36,663 tickets had been sold . 
&quot; In no country in the world do you have more than 10,000 freeloaders , &quot; Altinyeleklioglu said . 
&quot; We had a deal with a security firm to prevent freeloaders . 
but we failed . 
the sports ministry &apos;s Izmir representative , Bahri Vreskala , said 103 million lira ( $ 1,080 ) worth of tickets had been stolen before the Galatasaray match and that some turnstiles had been broken . 
officials at Turkish sports meetings are always ready to let friends and relatives in free , and the organisers of most events regularly send out dozens of invitations to friends and colleagues .
