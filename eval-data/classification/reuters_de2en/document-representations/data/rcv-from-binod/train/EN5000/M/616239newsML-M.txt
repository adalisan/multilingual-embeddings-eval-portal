the Czech PX50 index posted its biggest gain for three years on Tuesday after the central bank abandoned its battle with foreign speculators and allowed the crown to fall by more than eight percent against the mark . 
the PX50 rose 4.4 percent to 499.8 as the three most heavily capitalised shares , SPT Telecom , CEZ and Komercni Banka all rose by the maximum daily allowable eight percent . 
dealers said the euphoric mood was directly attributable to the fall of the crown but said the rebound was unlikely to be sustained in the longer term . 
&quot; There &apos;s short term bullish sentiment . 
the stock market should rise on the ( depreciation ) news . 
I think that in the longer term though you have to be more sober and look at the interest rates , &quot; said John Vax of ING Barings . 
on Monday evening the Czech National Bank said it would no longer defend the crown at levels then prevailing . 
the currency fell on Tuesday by more than eight percent to 19.5 against the mark . 
at the same time , however , it raised the key discount rate to 13.0 percent from 10.5 to prevent the crown falling too far .
