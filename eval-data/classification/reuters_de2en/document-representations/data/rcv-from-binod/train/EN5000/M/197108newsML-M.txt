Germany &apos;s DAX index of leading shares finished lower on Monday as attention was overwhelmingly fixed on market debutant Deutsche Telekom AG , which was able in contrast to post a strong gain in bourse trade . 
the DAX index of 30 leading shares , which the telecom giant will join on Tuesday , closed 31.96 points , or 1.14 percent , lower at 2,763.84 amid volumes described by traders as weak . 
Deutsche Telekom opened bourse trade at 33.20 marks , well above its issue price of 28.50 marks , before going on to add a further 70 pfennigs to 33.90 marks at the bourse close . 
trading volume in the share was huge , with some 37.7 million shares changing hands during floor trade and almost 30 million in computerised IBIS dealings . 
&quot; There &apos;s only one subject today and that &apos;s Telekom . 
don &apos;t go looking for much action elsewhere in the market , &quot; said one Frankfurt trader . 
later in the day , in specially-extended computer trade Telekom shares fell below their opening price and stood at 32.83 marks by 1715 GMT , with dealers saying some players were taking profit . 
computer trading hours have been temporarily extended by two hours to accomodate the anticipated large volumes of Telekom dealings . 
Telekom shares trading for the first time on Wall Street opened strongly above the issue price of $ 18.89 in heavy volumes hitting a high of $ 22-1 / 8 . 
the stock is due to be traded in Tokyo on Tuesday . 
dealers said the main impact on the stock during the day had been buying by institutions seeking to top up small allocations in the issue , which was heavily-oversubscribed and saw an unparalleled amount of interest by small investors . 
&quot; There is still a good chance that it can improve on this ( current ) level . 
there are a couple of institutions out there that didn &apos;t get much of an allocation but still haven &apos;t gone into the market yet , &quot; said one trader . 
dealers said they were overly concerned that the price of Telekom shares would fall much further , with many seeing support at around 31 marks . 
activity elsewhere in the market was limited , but shares in retailer Karstadt were weaker , falling over three percent or 17.75 marks to 554.45 marks , after it announced it expect 1996 earnings to be below those 1995 .
