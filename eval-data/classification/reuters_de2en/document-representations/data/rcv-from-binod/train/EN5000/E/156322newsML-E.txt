the government emerging from Romania &apos;s general election will have to tackle budgetary and currency issues if it wants to get fresh funds from the IMF , Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said . 
&quot; A new government in my opinion will have be quick to reverse the wrong trends which showed up in the past year , get them back on track again and get inflation again on the downward path , &quot; Zalm told a news conference . 
&quot; It depends on how quick a new government is formed , how quick this new government has a good financial economic programme ... Then the money will come again . 
President Ion Iliescu , a former communist in power since 1989 , leads opinion polls in a tight race for Sunday &apos;s presidential elections . 
but his Party for Social Democracy trails the opposition in surveys for the parliamentary vote and a coalition government is almost certain to be formed . 
last December , Romania signed a $ 280 million loan accord with the International Monetary Fund . 
but the Fund suspended tranches of credits earlier this year after expressing concern at restrictions on the local foreign exchange market . 
Romanian economists also suggest the IMF is unhappy with the pace of reforms and relaxation of budgetary discipline ahead of the election . 
Zalm made the remarks at the end of a two-day visit to Romania to discuss Romania &apos;s relations with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank . 
Romania &apos;s is represented by the Netherlands on the executive board of both institutions . 
Zalm said restoring the free functioning of the foreign exchange market was a key issue in the talks . 
&quot; We now have a period where is no free currency and that &apos;s very important not only for the point of view of IMF but also for the international bussiness comunity , &quot; he said . 
keen to prop the leu currency ahead of the voting , Romania restricted local markets to four dealers . 
the leu is quoted at 3,400 / 15 on the interbank market , but has slid to 4,000 / 4,300 at retail outlets . 
inflation and the budget deficit are also worrying . 
inflation was cut to 27.8 percent last year , but wage increases and soft credits for the inefficient farm sector have pushed it back up to a year-on-year rate of 45 percent . 
&quot; The budgetary problem will have to be tackled very quickly because with an overheated economy there was an increase in inflation . 
the budgetary aspect will be the most important thing to deal with , &quot; Zlam said . 
the state budget deficit stands at 1.9 trillion lei ( $ 563 million ) in the first eight months of the year but is forecast to balloon to 4.2 trillion by the end of 1996 , or some 3.5 percent of Romania &apos;s estimated gross domestic product .
