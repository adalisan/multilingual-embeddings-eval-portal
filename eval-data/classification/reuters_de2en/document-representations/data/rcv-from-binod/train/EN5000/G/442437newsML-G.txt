a Peruvian lawyer has taken the government to court over its decision early in the 87-day-old Lima hostage crisis to cut water , power and telephone services to the besieged Japanese ambassador &apos;s home . 
Javier Mujica , a labour law and human rights specialist , said in an interview on Friday the government &apos;s strategy violated the &quot; fundamental rights &quot; of the 72 men held by Marxist rebels at the residence by endangering their health and safety . 
Peru &apos;s constitution and international accords require that the state uphold &quot; human dignity , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The government can &apos;t respond to one illegality with another illegal act . 
dirty and uncomfortable conditions in the residence , stormed on Dec . 17 by 20-odd Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) rebels , may spark an unfortunate reaction by one or more of the captives or hostage-takers , Mujica said . 
&quot; The strategy leads to a violent end . 
a hostage may react irrationally and cause a tragedy , &quot; he said . 
Mujica said that , although five Peruvian Supreme Court judges are among the hostages whose rights he wants to defend , his Dec . 21 suit has already lost one ruling at the Lima Superior Court , but he was appealing this . 
water utility Sedapal , power distributor Luz del Sur and phone company Telefonica del Peru have brushed aside his complaint and courts have barred local human rights groups from joining in the suit , he added . 
Peru &apos;s labour laws bar workers of water , phone and power firm workers from striking because the services are &quot; basic to life &quot; but courts apparently feel otherwise when it comes to the hostages , Mujica said . 
but he plans to appeal the case to Peru &apos;s Constitutional Tribunal and , if needed , to the Inter-American Human Rights Commission . 
the MRTA took hundreds hostage when it stormed the mansion and security forces cut services to pressure the rebels by worsening conditions in the overcrowded mansion . 
most of the captives were freed in the first weeks . 
Mujica said he filed the lawsuit at the request of former hostages released by the MRTA along with 38 other captives on Dec . 20 .
