European bourses began Friday in two minds after Wall Street made a small loss on Thursday , reviving doubts over its recent record-breaking gains . 
in currencies , the dollar remained anchored just below the 1.50 level against the mark , but weakened against the yen on reports that Japan &apos;s discount rate is too low and may rise soon , traders said . 
London , Europe &apos;s biggest bourse , opened slightly higher then romped ahead around 0.5 percent when buyers emerged for energy utilities following recent bid activity and positive press comments for the sector . 
but business remained thin and dealers said the market was just as likely to drift back as investors played safe ahead of next week &apos;s budget and fretted about the danger of British rate rises and the strong pound . 
&quot; We &apos;re going to see a lot of significant moves today on no volume at all . 
there won &apos;t be much business behind it though . 
no one will want to do much before the budget , &quot; one dealer said . 
early attention also focused on Berisford , which soared 25p to 146p after it said it had received a preliminary approach . 
dealers said the early flurry of activity was likely to die off as investors returned to worrying about the budget and the risk Chancellor Kenneth Clarke might be tempted into a round of pre-election tax cuts . 
dealers said the Confederation of British Industry &apos;s monthly trends survey , which identified rising manufacturing demand , and recent figures showing consumer spending , would reinforce fears of a monetary tightening before Christmas . 
all eyes were now on Tuesday &apos;s budget , which one dealer tipped would contain around two billion pounds ( $ 3.4 billion ) of tax cuts and more curbs on public spending . 
in Frankfurt , German shares started bourse dealings lower after Wall Street &apos;s weaker close on Thursday and were down 0.4 percent at 1000 GMT . 
after setting November &apos;s 10th record high on Wednesday , Wall Street &apos;s Dow Jones index slipped 11.55 points to 6,418.47 as modest profit taking dragged it back from record highs . 
German dealers said business was thin and the market was consolidating after recent gains . 
Deutsche Telekom weakened further after falling in New York overnight . 
French shares also showed modest losses at the opening and were down 0.2 percent at 1000 GMT with operators taking profits and allowing the market to consolidate . 
traders said franc softness along with a cautious Wall Street were factors steering the market lower . 
Eurotunnel fell 1.32 percent , continuing the week &apos;s weakness since a fire disrupted services . 
the dollar recovered some of its breath after dipping against the yen in early European trade and held steady against the mark , though hovering beneath the psychological barrier of 1.50 marks . 
against the yen the dollar was well bid on dips after it softenedto a session low at 111.10 yen , with traders saying it should remain well supported above the 111.00 level . 
Pat Magill , head of Daiwa Europe &apos;s corporate desk , said the dollar &apos;s dip against the yen had followed reports that a vice minister at Japan &apos;s Economic Planning Agency ( EPA ) had said the discount rate of 0.5 percent was too low and should rise soon . 
the dollar was quoted at 111.26 yen and 1.4986 marks against 111.43 yen and 1.4980 marks late on Thursday . 
the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was up 20.4 points at 3,974.2 . 
in Paris , the CAC-40 share index was down 4.48 points at 2,229.09 . 
gold opened firmer at $ 377.00 against $ 376.65 at the London close on Thursday . 
good physical demand in Europe helped prices .
