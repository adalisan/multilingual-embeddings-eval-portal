Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday will consider a plan to issue up to $ 200 million of bonds to help fund earthquake repairs and improvements to damaged steel-frame buildings . 
the owners of the buildings would pay for the repairs through a 20- to 30-year voluntary special assessment that would back the city bond issue , according to Gerry Miller , chief of debt administration for the city of Los Angeles . 
under the plan , a special city assessment district would be set up to handle the financing . 
the city , through the special district , would issue the bonds &quot; acting as a conduit to provide the building owners with access to the markets , &quot; Miller said . 
the deal should provide interest rate savings to the building owners , making it easier for them to carry out the needed earthquake repairs , Miller added . 
after the devastating 1994 Northridge earthquake , cracks were found in many steel-framed buildings . 
the owners were told to make repairs but they complained about the high cost . 
the $ 200 million quake bond program was proposed by the Los Angeles Building Owners and Managers Association .
