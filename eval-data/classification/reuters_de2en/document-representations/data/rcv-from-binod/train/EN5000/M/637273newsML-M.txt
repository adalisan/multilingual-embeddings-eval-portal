shares closed with the PSI index at a new high , buoyed by the strength of the dollar . 
but with other European markets generally flat , the trend for tomorrow as unclear , traders said . 
* Traders said that the market would probably be cautious ahead of the release of unemployment figures in the United States on Thursday . 
the dollar would once again be a key factor . 
* Cimpor , Banco Comercial Portugues and Telecel all closed with gains of over one percent . 
the PSI index ended at a record high of 6,799.16 , up 46.21 points . 
* Engineering group Efacac was again one of the day &apos;s most heavily-traded stocks , still basking in the glow of a buy recommendation from one domestic broker . 
* Sonae Industria crept closer to the price at which it will launch its capital call , aided by optimism over the outlook for the wood products sector .
