the South African Rugby Football Union ( SARFU ) turned to the untried Carel du Plessis to replace disgraced Andre Markgraaff as springbok coach on Tuesday . 
described in his playing days as the &quot; prince of wings &quot; , Du Plessis , 36 , becomes the youngest coach in the Springboks history . 
he has the dual responsibility of leading his country through a gruelling 13 internationals in 1997 as well as healing some of the game &apos;s self-inflicted wounds . 
&quot; It is not only about obtaining results . 
it &apos;s also the showcase which SARFU has to present to the rugby public , the disadvantaged communities and internationally , &quot; said du Plessis . 
it &apos;s about vision , it &apos;s about equipping players for test rugby . 
the former Western Province and springbok winger -- unrelated to South Africa &apos;s World Cup winning manager Morne du Plessis -- retired at the age of 29 as sporting isolation limited his international career to just 12 tests between 1982 and 1989 . 
since quitting rugby he has made a career as a gilts trader and is a partner in a Cape Town corporate services company . 
he returned to the game in an official capacity only when Markgraaff employed him as tactical adviser during the Springboks &apos; five-test clean sweep on their tour of Argentina , France and Wales . 
&quot; Carel is a great leader and visionary and he possesses a shrewd rugby mind , &quot; said SARFU chief executive Rian Oberholzer . 
&quot; The executive committee of SARFU are confident that he can knit together the different strands of springbok rugby and come up with a winning combination . 
du Plessis captained Western Province during a golden era in the 1980s , playing alongside brothers Willie and Michael . 
a new manager is expected to be announced next week along with a backroom team . 
the roles of manager and coach had been united under Markgraaff but have again been divided . 
Markgraaff resigned last week after a secret tape recording was published of a conversation in which he made racist remarks against black sports officials .
