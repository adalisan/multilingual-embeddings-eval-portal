Israeli soldiers faced Palestinian motorists in a tense standoff on Sunday on a road off-limits to Arab civilian traffic near a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip . 
encouraged by Palestinian police to take to the banned road , hundreds of motorists jammed a two-km ( one-mile ) strip in front of the settlement of Netzarim for most of the day in protest at Israeli travel restrictions in force since a Moslem suicide attack in 1994 . 
Israeli military jeeps and armoured personnel carriers took up positions to block the route and officers warned they would open fire if cars pressed on towards the settlement . 
but by nightfall , traffic had thinned and Palestinian drivers cautiously cut through fields , creating a detour that kept them some 100 metres ( yards ) from the Israeli positions . 
earlier , a senior PLO official threatened an explosion of violence if Israeli and Palestinian officers failed to defuse the crisis . 
&quot; If this road is not open it will lead to problems similar to those of the opening of the tunnel , &quot; Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu Medeen told Israel &apos;s Arabic radio , referring to bloody riots in September sparked by Israel &apos;s opening of an entrance to a tourist tunnel in Arab East Jerusalem . 
the Council for Jewish Settlements in Judea , Samaria ( the West Bank ) and Gaza , threatened in a statement to block Palestinian traffic in parts of the areas on Monday morning to show solidarity with &quot; besieged &quot; Netzarim . 
but the council later said it had decided to cancel the planned protest after &quot; senior officials intervened &quot; and in the assumption &quot; everything will be normal tomorrow at Netzarim &quot; . 
Palestinian cars veered onto the Netzarim road after Arabs blocked Gaza &apos;s main highway with metal pipes to force drivers to travel on the strip that passes within 500 metres ( yards ) of the settlement . 
the road was closed to all Palestinians in November 1994 when an Islamist suicide bomber on a bicycle blew himself up and killed three soldiers . 
Israeli settlers and troops continued to use the road , which was opened in July to limited Palestinian official traffic -- PLO police and dignitaries with special passes . 
Palestinians said they expected it to be opened gradually to civilians . 
a Reuters correspondent said Palestinian police waved Arab motorists onto the road on Sunday . 
Israeli soldiers then took up defensive positions in a nearby field , pointing rifles towards the backed-up lines of Palestinian cars . 
one Israeli border policeman had the words &quot; Born to Kill &quot; , written on the back of his police vest . 
&quot; If anyone gets closer , to within four metres , of the armoured personnel carrier , we &apos;ll shoot him , &quot; witnesses quoted an Israeli colonel as telling a Palestinian police major . 
&quot; People have no choice but to go the way of Netzarim which is the shortest way , or to go a very long way around , &quot; Sufian Abu Zaydeh , head of the Palestinian Authority &apos;s Israel desk , told army radio . 
under peace deals that set up Gaza autonomy in 1994 , Israeli and Palestinian forces jointly patrol main highways . 
Israeli troops guard Jewish settlements and roads connected to them . 
about 4,000 Jewish settlers live amidst Gaza &apos;s one million Palestinians .
