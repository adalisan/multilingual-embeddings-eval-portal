Italy plans to send soldiers to the crime-ridden southern port city of Naples later this month to help police battle a wave of mob violence which has swept the area since the start of the year . 
Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano told reporters on Monday that the troops would take over routine guard duties around the city , allowing hundreds of extra police officers to be redeployed in the battle against organised crime . 
Napolitano said on Sunday that the centre-left government would decide this week on the exact nature of the planned operation , stressing it would be &quot; limited and targeted &quot; . 
some 85 people have been killed and dozens injured over the past six months as the Naples Mafia , known as the Camorra , wages a ruthless war for supremacy within the fragmented organisation . 
the feuding has often spilt over into the streets and there was public outrage last month after a young woman , walking home with her six-year-old son , was killed by a stray bullet during a mob attack in central Naples . 
the decision to call in the army came after another weekend of terror , in which two suspected mobsters were mown down in broad daylight and a number of innocent bystanders , including an eight-year old girl , were injured in wild shootings . 
Interior ministry officials said that around 600 troops would be drafted into the area to help restore order to a city which has been branded &quot; the wild west &quot; by Italian media . 
but Defence Minister Beniamino Andreatta said many more soldiers might be needed . 
&quot; It is not just a question of 600 soldiers because you have to think about shifts , so that number will have to be multiplied by at least three , &quot; he told reporters . 
Naples is one of Europe &apos;s poorest cities and suffers chronic unemployment , but it has enjoyed a revivial in recent years and its newly restored historic centre has become a tourist draw . 
local hoteliers said they were worried that the sight of armed soldiers in the city might frighten visitors away . 
&quot; The presence of the army on the streets could damage Naples &apos; image , &quot; said Mario Pagliari , head of the Naples hoteliers association . 
but local politicians breathed a sigh of relief over the government &apos;s decision . 
&quot; It is a useful , positive and important step , &quot; mayor Antonio Bassolino told reporters . 
Napolitano said recent police successes against the 40 Camorra clans in and around Naples helped spark the internecine battles as depleted groups struggled for dominance . 
however , he cautioned that the army alone could not solve the problem . 
&quot; Unfortunately this is not an instant remedy . 
it is necessary to mobilize public opinion , to isolate the Camorra groups which fight each other ferociously , &quot; Napolitano said . 
it is not the first time Italy has decided to send troops onto the streets . 
the army was called up in 1978 following the kidnap and murder of the then prime minister Aldo Moro and , more recently , soldiers were sent to the southern region of Calabria and the island of Sardinia to help combat crime waves . 
troops are still stationed in Sicily five years after they were called in following the murder of two leading magistrates .
