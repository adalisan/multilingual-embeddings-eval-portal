Asian crude prices were mostly steady on Tuesday with MidEast grades showing signs of firmer premiums after their differentials with Dubai narrowed . 
however , regional grades remained deeply discounted , although traders said the price fall may have now levelled off . 
Oman was heard traded several times at flat to the official selling price , consolidating a firmer tone after being discounted last week as low as 6.5 cents . 
a trader sold 500,000 barrels and a partial 250,000 barrels to a U.S. major and a Japanese refiner respectively . 
a producer sold an Oman cargo at flat to a U.S. major . 
the Oman OSP of $ 19.72 narrowed the differential to Dubai to $ 1.05 from $ 1.14 , easing the price pressure on sellers . 
sentiment over ADNOC grades was less bearish , with prices talked at flat to a small premium for the remaining cargoes . 
but Dubai weakened slightly on paper , a reflection of the low take up of wet cargos by IOC in its April buying tender . 
April / May spread narrowed three cents to be quoted at 20 / 26 cents , reflecting the fact that those who were not awarded in the India tender have exposed their pricing . 
on regional dealings , a large chunk of Minas left hanging over the market has been taken up by China , traders said . 
both were sold to China . 
Duri was also finding some interest from blenders , which was supporting the price after the crude traded last week at ICP -50 cents . 
traders said the regional market looks more balanced now , although they estimated that Pertamina had stored large amounts of crude to avoid selling it on the export market .
