Iran said on Saturday it had seized over 840 kg ( 1,850 lb ) of opium and 690 kg ( 1,520 lb ) of other narcotics from drug traffickers . 
&quot; Some 841 kgs of opium and a large amount of ammunition were seized from smugglers in the eastern deserts of the country over the past couple of days , &quot; Iran &apos;s official news agency IRNA said . 
&quot; In another operation which involved armed clashes with the smugglers in the Salehabad and Torbat-e jam area of Khorasan ( north-eastern Iran ) , 690 kg of narcotics were confiscated and leading gang members arrested over the past few days , &quot; it said . 
according to Iranian law , possession of five kg ( 11 lb ) of opium or 30 grammes ( just over one ounce ) of heroin is punishable by death . 
more than 1,000 people have been executed in drug-related cases since the law took effect in 1989 . 
Iran is a key transit route for drugs , mostly opium from which heroin is made , being smuggled to Europe via Turkey from Afghanistan and Pakistan -- the so-called &quot; Golden Crescent &quot; .
