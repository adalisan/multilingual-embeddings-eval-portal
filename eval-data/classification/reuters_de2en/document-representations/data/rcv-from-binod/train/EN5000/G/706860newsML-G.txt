the time trial &apos; special &apos; bike which Tour de France titleholder Bjarne Riis of Denmark planned to ride in Saturday &apos;s opening race against the clock was banned by race organisers on Friday . 
Spanish rival Abraham Olano was also forbidden to use one of the bikes provided by Italian maker Pinarello , as was Riis &apos;s Deutsche Telekom teammate Jan Ullrich of Germany . 
the ruling applied forbids &quot; anything that reduces resistance and offers artificial acceleration such as a fuselage &quot; . 
Russian Pavel Tonkov suffered the same fate in the Giro d &apos;Italia last month . 
on that occasion he was waiting to mount the starting ramp in Baselga di Pine in a 40 kms time trial when an official insisted he use another machine . 
technical officials at the Union Cycliste International have been tightening up on bike design . 
they claimed that the &apos; specials &apos; are not generally available , and that there was a trend towards a bike being considered more important than the rider . 
track bikes used to win Olympic golds in Atlanta have since been outlawed by new rulings on their dimensions .
