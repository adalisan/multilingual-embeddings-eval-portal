multi-millionaire Richard Branson is one of Britain &apos;s most successful entrepreneurs and his image as a former hippie who still likes schoolboyish pranks belies a restless urge to take on new challenges . 
Branson and two co-pilots soared slowly into the Moroccan sky on Tuesday , hoping to become the first to fly all around the world by balloon . 
Branson , 46 , rates as one of Britain &apos;s best known faces in public and his latest attempt combines a taste for adventure with a mission single-handedly to promote his Virgin Group around the world . 
Branson has always recognised that the ultimate price to be paid for that publicity might be his life , but the temptation to complete what he calls &quot; the last great aviation record and adventure left on earth &quot; has proved irresistible . 
he publicly promised his wife Joan he would give up ballooning six years ago after a successful crossing of the Pacific with balloon designer Per Lindstrand only narrowly missed disaster , crash-landing on a frozen lake in Canada . 
my wife knows this , &quot; Branson said recently . 
opinion polls have variously voted him in recent years as a possible candidate for president if Britain abolished the monarchy , as an ideal role model by young people , and as Britain &apos;s most admired businessman . 
he started his first business venture at the age of 16 publishing a student magazine and soon after dropped out of his privileged private education at Stowe public school . 
although the magazine venture proved short-lived his attempts to sell advertising space put him onto the idea of selling records by mail order and two years later Virgin mail-order was born , with shops and then hit recordings following in quick succession . 
a big breakthrough came in 1973 with the launch of the Virgin Records label with Mike Oldfield &apos;s &quot; Tubular bells &quot; , which sold over five million copies , and other big acts were to follow , including Genesis , The Sex pistols , Phil Collins , Boy George , Paula Abdul , Janet Jackson and the Rolling Stones . 
Branson has since developed a diversified consumer goods and entertainment group with sales of nearly two billion pounds a year and a wide range of interests including air and rail services , nightclubs and hotels , drinks , books and financial services , all woven together around the Virgin brand . 
he has also amassed a huge personal fortune , boosted in 1992 with the sale of Virgin Records to Thorn EMI for 560 million pounds ( $ 941 million ) , a move which he said was prompted by his determination to have a full warchest in the battle to save his fledgling airline Virgin Atlantic Airways . 
the investment paid off and Branson was front page news in 1993 after winning a celebrated libel case against his much bigger rival British Airways over allegations of dirty tricks . 
Branson made his first attempt to enter the record books in 1985 , the year after he launched his Virgin Atlantic airline , by trying to make the fastest-ever crossing by boat of the Atlantic . 
that time his powerboat capsized 225 km ( 140 ) miles off the British coast and he was rescued by helicopter but the following year he achieved his aim with Virgin Atlantic Challenger II . 
despite an eight-hour hold-up at sea with fuel trouble he knocked two hours and nine minutes off the old record of three days 10 hours and 40 minutes held by the liner United States . 
then in July 1987 he completed a record-breaking Atlantic crossing by hot-air balloon from Maine to Northern Ireland in one-and-a-half days and made more headlines when his balloon had to be rescued from the sea . 
again there was drama including a helicopter rescue after the Virgin Atlantic flyer touched down in Ireland but &quot; bounced &quot; into the sea off Scotland .
