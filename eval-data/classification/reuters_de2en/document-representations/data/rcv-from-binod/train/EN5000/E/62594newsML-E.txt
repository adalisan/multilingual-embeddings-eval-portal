the following is the complete text of the minutes of the July 30 monthly monetary policy meeting between Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George : 
the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England met , together with officials , on 30 July , to review monetary developments . 
monetary and Economic Developments 
latest monetary and economic data ( reviewed by officials before the meeting ) provided further evidence of weaker cost and price pressures . 
while output data showed growth remaining below trend , recent indicators of business confidence and consumer demand were more buoyant . 
inflation Indicators 
All-items RPI inflation fell by 0.1 percentage point , to 2.1 per cent , as recent mortgage rate cuts continued to take effect . 
most other price and cost indicators confirmed that inflationary pressures remained weak : 
- the oil price had fallen to $ 18.9 per barrel , and non-oil commodity prices had continued to decline ; but sterling &apos;s effective exchange rate index fell by nearly 2 per cent over the period since the last meeting , to stand at 85.1 ; 
- total non-oil import prices fell by 0.8 per cent in the three months to May compared to the previous three months ; and non-EC import prices fell by 0.3 per cent in the three months to June ; 
- producer input prices for manufacturing ( excluding food , beverage , tobacco and petroleum industries ) fell again in June , by 1.3 per cent ; and compared to a year ago they were 4.7 per cent lower . 
the CIPS survey input price indicator also fell sharply in June ; 
- producer output prices for manufacturing ( excluding FBTP ) rose by 0.1 per cent in June ; and the annual inflation rate fell to 2.0 per cent , from 2.4 per cent in May . 
- the annual growth rate of underlying average earnings fell to 3 per cent in May , down from 3 per cent in April ; 
- IRS median pay settlements were unchanged at 3.0 per cent in June . 
monetary and Financial Indicators 
no new M0 data had been published since the last meeting , although provisional and partial information suggested that growth had fallen back again following the sharp rise in June . 
both M4 and M4 lending grew by 0.7 per cent in June , down from 0.8 per cent in May . 
the 12-month growth rates for M4 and M4 lending rose slightly to 10.0 per cent and 9.4 per cent respectively . 
no new data on house prices were available since the last meeting . 
housing market transactions had started to recover ; particulars delivered ( which lag actual transactions ) in the three months to June were 4.7 per cent up on the previous three months , although only 1.7 per cent up on a year earlier . 
short-term interest rates were little changed in the US since the last meeting , but had fallen slightly in Germany , and risen slightly in Japan . 
official rates had been reduced in Italy . 
forward interest rates implicit in short-sterling futures contracts were also little changed for September 1996 , but had fallen ( by up to 20 basis points ) for longer maturities . 
10-year bond yields in the US had risen by around 10 basis points , but had fallen by over 10 basis points in Germany , and were little changed in Japan . 
in the UK , yields on conventional gilts were little changed at all maturities . 
since the 3 July meeting inflation expectations implied by the gilt yield curve ( calculated by the Bank from the difference between the yields on conventional and index-linked bonds ) had risen slightly for both 5 and 10 years ahead . 
activity Indicators 
9.Overseas data indicated that US activity remained strong , and there were further signs of recovery in Japan . 
activity indicators in Germany remained mixed : 
- in the US the June employment numbers were again strong , and unemployment had fallen to 5.3 per cent - the lowest rate since June 1990 . 
industrial production rose by 0.5 per cent in June , following a rise of 0.5 per cent in May also ; 
- in Japan industrial production rose by 2.4 per cent in May , following a rise of 3.2 per cent in April ; 
- in Germany industrial production rose by 1.0 per cent in May ; but business confidence fell back sharply in June , and unemployment rose slightly . 
annual whole economy GDP growth in Q2 was 1.8 per cent , down from 1.9 per cent in Q1 . 
services output was estimated to have grown by 0.7 per cent in Q2 , and was 2.7 per cent higher than a year earlier . 
other output data were consistent with growth overall below trend ; but consumer indicators were again strong , and survey information pointed to more buoyant business confidence : 
- manufacturing output was unchanged in May . 
however , in the three months to May it was 0.4 per cent higher than a year earlier . 
total industrial production rose by 0.8 per cent in May , and in the latest three months was up 1.2 per cent on a year earlier ; 
- all major business surveys were more buoyant . 
- retail sales rose by 1.3 per cent in June , and figures for April and May were also evised up . 
in the three months to June sales were 2.7 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier ; 
- survey indicators in the retail sector also remained strong : consumer confidence rose slightly , and in the June CBI distributive Trades Survey the balance of retailers expecting higher sales remained at a high level by historical standards ; 
- claimant unemployment fell by 14,300 in June , and unfilled vacancies at jobcentres rose by 13,000 . 
summary of discussion 
the Governor said that the data that had become available since the 3 July meeting served to reinforce the prospect of weak inflationary pressures in the short run on the one hand , but increasing strength of domestic demand - especially consumption - in the period ahead on the other . 
in that context the Bank &apos;s August Inflation Report would point to a somewhat greater upside risk to the inflation target by the spring / summer of 1998 than was projected in the May Report . 
immediate cost and price pressures remained weak in June . 
producer input prices , in particular , again had fallen ( to 2 per cent below their level of a year earlier , or -4.7 per cent ex FBTP ) helped by the temporary appreciation of sterling ; and output prices had risen by only 0.1 per cent ( a rise of around 2 per cent on the year , excluding excise duties ) , with the survey evidence suggesting that they would remain subdued over the next few months at least . 
underlying earnings growth had edged downwards ( to 3 per cent in the year to May ) , and pay settlements remained just below 3 per cent in June on the Bank &apos;s 3-month employment-weighted average . 
although claimant unemployment had continued to decline , and job vacancies to increase , the LFS suggested that the demand for labour had not been rising in the spring . 
retail price inflation had not fallen as the Bank had expected in June ( RPIX , RPIY and the headline rate were all unchanged from May , at 2.8 per cent , 2.3 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively ) partly because of food and household goods prices - with the summer sales perhaps starting later this year . 
the Bank nevertheless continued to expect that RPIX would resume its fall in the autumn - to below 2 per cent - before it began to pick up again in the course of next year . 
the Governor noted that further ahead , the inflation prospect depended on the speed and strength of the upturn in demand and activity . 
new data on this , as well as all the main surveys since the last meeting , had been relatively strong . 
in part this was explained by the fall in agricultural output as a result of the BSE crisis - without which output growth would in fact have picked up , again led by the services sector . 
as it was , retail sales volumes ( helped by sales of summer clothing ) were very strong in June - up 1.3 per cent - and the April and May figures had been revised up to give a 1.3 per cent quarterly rise over Q1 and a 2.7 per cent rise over Q2 last year . 
there had also been a significant improvement in both the CBI &apos;s distributive Trades and the consumer confidence surveys . 
and , although Halifax house prices had fallen modestly in June , the underlying recovery of demand in the housing market appeared intact , with a modest improvement in turnover , net lending , new commitments and the number of site visitors over the past 2-3 months . 
business confidence too appeared to be improving , to judge from the quarterly CBI and BCC surveys , as well as the earlier survey of Purchasing Managers . 
the latest money and credit data remained consistent with the prospect of rising nominal demand growth later this year and next . 
narrow money growth remained at 7 per cent year-on-year , and faster on a 3- or 6-month annualised basis . 
and there was little sign in the June data of any significant deceleration in the underlying growth of either broad money or M4 lending - both rising at about 9 per cent on a 3-month annualised basis to June . 
first estimates of the sectoral breakdown of money and credit in Q2 showed that individuals &apos; deposits had continued to rise strongly , as had ICCs &apos; deposits , although OFIs &apos; deposits had risen more slowly than in Q1 ( when they were inflated by the introduction of the gilt repo market ) . 
consumer credit had also grown strongly in Q2 despite a more moderate figure for June . 
the Governor concluded that , taken as a whole , the evidence since the last meeting suggested more clearly than before that the pick-up in demand - driven by household demand - that we had all been expecting was now beginning to occur . 
on that basis the Bank saw no justification for further policy stimulus . 
in fact , as the Chancellor knew , the Bank would prefer short-term rates at 6 per cent . 
it was possible that this month &apos;s data exaggerated the underlying acceleration of demand . 
but the opposite risk was that if the acceleration continued through the summer and into the autumn it would become increasingly difficult to moderate . 
the Chancellor said that there was almost universal agreement that the economy was now picking up . 
his expectation of stronger growth in the second half of the year was undiminished . 
in his view , this was to be welcomed but needed to be seen against the background of below trend growth in recent quarters . 
the preliminary figures for GDP in Q2 were a little disappointing and surprising , though perhaps distorted downwards by a one-off BSE effect on agricultural output . 
for manufacturing , the actual data did not yet show a pick-up in output , although the survey evidence was much more encouraging . 
continuing , the Chancellor noted that consumption was now stronger . 
retail sales in June had picked up strongly , although they were still only 2.7 per cent up on a year earlier , and followed a run of more disappointing data . 
retail markets also remained very competitive , with little sign of upward pressure on margins . 
the housing market had picked up steadily . 
the Halifax and Nationwide house price indices were now sending consistent signals but were probably affected by shortages of particular types of property in some areas . 
turnover had begun to pick up but this was from a very low base . 
monetary growth was little changed . 
inflation data remained extremely encouraging . 
commodity prices had fallen . 
producer input price inflation ( on an annual basis ) had turned negative in June for the first time in two years , and output price inflation fell again to 2.6 per cent in June ( compared with 2.8 per cent in May ) . 
RPIX inflation was unchanged in June at 2.8 per cent , and was expected to decline further in the coming months . 
the Chancellor was also encouraged by the labour market data , as unemployment continued to fall while earnings growth fell back to 3 per cent in June , and settlements showed little change . 
although sterling had slipped from its highs in the previous month , it had stabilised over the past couple of weeks . 
the Chancellor concluded that his view on the stance of policy had not changed since the previous meeting . 
he was inclined to leave interest rates unchanged . 
if inflation pressures started to pick up as a result of stronger growth there would clearly be a case for tightening policy ; he was prepared to act pre-emptively , as he had done in 1994 . 
but he saw no evidence yet of those pressures . 
in discussion the following points were made : 
- there was increasing evidence to support the expectation that growth would pick up in the second half of this year , led by domestic demand . 
consumer demand had already increased , growing by around 4 per cent ( at an annual rate ) in the first half of the year - rather faster than retail sales . 
most surveys also suggested that output was starting to respond to higher demand ( although over the last year or so more buoyant survey expectations had tended not to be fully realised ) . 
the monetary aggregates were also consistent with this interpretation ; 
- while it might still be some time before the stronger survey evidence was reflected in official output data , there were increasing signs that activity had shifted up a gear . 
the downside risks to activity in the short term , identified at previous meetings , had receded again . 
this picture was consistent with the central expectation for inflation in official forecasts ; 
- the cuts in interest rates since December , which had already helped improve confidence , were one factor underpinning the stronger outlook . 
if stronger growth led to the prospect of rising inflation which put the target at risk , it would be important to act pre-emptively ( as had happened in 1994 ) . 
conclusion 
summing up , the Chancellor concluded that the information since the previous meeting had tended to confirm expectations about the prospects for inflation , and that interest rates should remain unchanged for the moment .
