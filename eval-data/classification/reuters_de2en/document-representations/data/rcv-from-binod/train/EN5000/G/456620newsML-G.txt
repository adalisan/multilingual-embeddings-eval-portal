the president of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday presented a key resolution to enlarge the Security Council that would allow Japan and Germany to become permanent members but without veto power . 
the document from Razali Ismail of Malaysia would expand the 15-member council to 24 seats and is considered the first serious attempt to reform the body after years of discussions . 
the draft is bound to be changed but many members say the resolution , after years of fruitless discussions , has a chance of resolving the issue . 
Razali &apos;s proposal would : 
-- add five permanent members , two from industrialised states and one each from Africa , Asia and Latin America , all without veto power . 
Germany and Japan are considered the frontrunners for two of the seats . 
-- add four non-permanent members , one each from Africa , Asia , eastern Europe and Latin America . 
-- decide on the new permanent members before next March . 
-- review the changes in 10 years . 
the Security Council now has 15 members , five of them permanent with veto powers -- the United States , Britain , France , China and Russia , the Second World War victors . 
the 10 non-permanent members serve for two years . 
any council changes would have to be accepted by a two-thirds vote in the 185-seat General Assembly and by the current five permanent council members . 
they would also require a revision of the U.N. Charter , which would have to be ratified by national legislatures . 
&quot; This is knuckle down and begin time , &quot; said British Ambassador Sir John Weston , adding that it was a good basis for negotiation . 
&quot; We have talked long enough . 
at issue is long-standing criticism that the council , which deals with peace and security and has enforcement powers , was created on the ashes of the Second World War and its permanent members reflect the world of 50 years ago . 
many now-independent nations were colonies then and Japan , Germany , Italy and others were vanquished and considered enemy states . 
the council was enlarged in 1965 from 11 to 15 members but the permanent members remained the same . 
Germany and Japan are bound to oppose not having veto power , relegating them to second-class status while they are being asked to pay more for peacekeeping operations . 
Germany also would like the issue resolved before next March , fearing it could unravel if too much time is spent negotiating . 
the United States wants a small council of perhaps 21 or 22 seats . 
Washington would also have problems if the veto were extended to more than Germany and Japan . 
Italy &apos;s Ambasador , Paulo Fulci , is opposed to the entire plan , presumably because if Germany received a permanent seat Italy would be the only major European state without one . 
he has become known for his famous soundbite : &quot; We lost the war too . 
Italy wants to add non-permanent members only , giving preference to those with economic and political power . 
he called Razali &apos;s plan more undemocratic than the current setup as it creates three instead of two categories of members and said it was a system &quot; we shall not accept . 
the big fight , however , will be over which Third World countries would be voted into the council , and intense lobbying is expected at an April conference of non-aligned states in New Delhi . 
Germany , Italy , Japan and other countries will send senior officials to make their cases .
