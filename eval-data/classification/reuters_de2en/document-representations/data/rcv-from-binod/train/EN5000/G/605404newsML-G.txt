the all-male contenders in Friday &apos;s Iranian presidential election have caught on to the fact that the female vote could just swing the polls their way . 
in the Islamic republic &apos;s most competitive election since its 1979 revolution , four presidential candidates -- three of them Shi &apos;ite clerics -- are eager to portray themselves as champions of womens &apos; rights . 
with analysts suggesting a tight race between former culture minister Mohammad Khatami and Parliamentary Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri , womens &apos; votes could be critical . 
the appeal to the women runs from revolutionary nationalism to real issues affecting everyday life for Iran &apos;s 30 million women , including political and legal representation and social issues such as the strict dress codes under Islamic law . 
&quot; Women have always been oppressed in the West and in our country in the past ... 
your participation in the presidential elections will hurt the Islamic Republic &apos;s enemies , &quot; is the message from Nateq-Nouri whose campaign literature lists his achievements in promoting women being elected to parliament and a role for women as advisers in family courts . 
but behind the rhetoric Iranian women are slowly gaining a voice in the Islamic republic , centring on issues such as political power , better treatment under civil law , advancement in the workplace and more cultural freedom . 
Khatami , who has promised to appoint women in his cabinet based on merit , appears to have wide support among women some of whom fear that Nateq-Nouri would tighten social freedoms . 
&quot; All the candidates know how the political support of women is more important than ever before , &quot; said Shahla Lahiji , a Tehran-based publisher . 
&quot; One of the first changes we are looking for is in the civil law . 
it must change and it will , &quot; Lahiji said , referring to unequal legal rights between men and women in the courts . 
women continue to have a limited role in the political decision-making process in Iran though the election of 13 women in Iran &apos;s last parliamentary election was a sign of progress . 
Faezeh Hashemi , daughter of outgoing president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and a prominent member of parliament , told a press conference it was too early for Iran to have a female president . 
but she added : &quot; I do hope and believe that we can have a woman minister and it would depend on the elected president , whoever that would be . 
&quot; Hashemi has campaigned for Khatami . 
but the sheer uphill task of gaining real power was , to many women , starkly shown when a body of senior clerics and lawyers called the Guardian Council rejected all women candidates who had signed up to run in Friday &apos;s election . 
few women have senior positions in government departments and many complain of what in the West is described as a &quot; glass ceiling &quot; setting a limit on promotions in the workplace . 
&quot; I work longer hours than my male colleagues and my managers do not want to use my skills , &quot; said Maryam , a 27-year-old technician who says her employer is ignoring her skills . 
cultural freedoms , such as the ability to travel alone , and a relaxation of Islamist dress codes which force women to keep themselves covered in public under the hejab or chador , are also pressing concerns . 
although womens &apos; issues are now on the political agenda and , unlike in Iran &apos;s neighbouring Gulf Arab states , they can actually vote , it will take some time for real change . 
&quot; Any president would be strait-jacketed within the framework of the system . 
so he can &apos;t do anything special for women . 
minor liberties is the most he can do if he is broad minded , &quot; said one Iranian female journalist .
