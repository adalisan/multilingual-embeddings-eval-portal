IPE gas oil was expected to open unchanged on Wednesday with the prompt Brent crude contract called down 5-10 cents on the back of overnight U.S. stock statistics , brokers said . 
weekly U.S. stock figures from the American Petroleum Institute were seen as bearish with crude stocks up over 2.7 million barrels on the week ended August 8 , against an expected draw of 1.75 million barrels . 
the build came as refinery utilisation dipped 2.1 per cent to 95 per cent capacity . 
&quot; The API &apos;s are a bit bearish and should take the steam out of the market , &quot; one broker predicted . 
IPE September gas oil closed one dollar a tonne firmer on Tuesday at $ 170.75 after a quiet expiry of the August contract . 
brokers saw gas oil better supported than crude and called the contract to open steady on Tuesday &apos;s close . 
&quot; There &apos;s more physical interest on the gas oil and it is technically better supported on the way down . 
I would advise my clients to buy the gas and sell the crude , &quot; one said , adding he saw resistance on September in the $ 172- $ 172.50 area . 
Iraqi newspapers said on Wednesday that Iraq expects to resume oil exports under its oil-for-food deal today .
