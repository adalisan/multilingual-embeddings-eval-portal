European vegetable oil traders were not expecting any firm tenders to emerge during the coming week . 
figures released by the Malaysian Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority ( PORLA ) on Saturday should have been bearish for the palm oil sector , but data from Malaysian cargo surveyor Societe General de Surveillance ( SGS ) on Monday neutralised the affect of the PORLA figures . 
PORLA put Malaysian palm oil stocks at end-February at 722,993 tonnes against 696,487 tonnes at end-January . 
exports were pegged at 376,886 tonnes against 553,306 tonnes at end-January while production was put at 503,436 tonnes , 13.11 percent down . 
earlier estimates had put production as much as 21 percent down , but output recovered more quickly than expected after the long holiday in Malaysia during the first half of February . 
traders said the PORLA figures confirmed their view that palm oil was over-priced and due for a downward correction . 
however , on Monday SGS released its estimate for the first 15 days of March , putting exports at 311,924 tonnes against 203,609 during the same period in February , offsetting the PORLA figures . 
&quot; Exports are going to be the most important factor in the coming weeks , far more important than anything that is going on in Chicago , &quot; said one trader . 
traders said volatile trading in Chicago was likely to cause problems and keep many buyers out of the market . 
&quot; Chicago is trading on what fund managers want and not fundamentals and while they do that this market will only trade on a day-to-day basis , &quot; said another trader . 
traders expressed doubts over talk on Friday which pushed the Chicago market higher and attracted the interest of the funds again . 
market talk at the end of last week suggested Brazil may impose a tax on the export of soybeans . 
but European traders found this hard to swallow . 
&quot; We can &apos;t see the Brazilians handing the market to the Americans in this way , it makes no sense , &quot; said one . 
Brazilian crushers and the Brazilian Agricultural Ministry said an export tax on soybeans and products was unlikely and would be rejected by the ministry . 
traders said soft oils were more likely to move at the moment on currency factors with Chicago being watched but not necessarily followed . 
Lauric oils were expected to be quiet with little demand seen ahead of the Easter holiday next week . 
stocks of coconut oil in Rotterdam stood at 24,033 on March 17 against 26,705 tonnes on March 10 . 
Palmkernel oil stocks were 10,129 tonnes against 10,068 .
