Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov signed a memorandum on Friday which included an agreement on transporting oil across the breakaway region &apos;s territory , Itar-Tass news agency said on Friday . 
a government spokesman in Moscow said details of the contents of the memorandum were not immediately available . 
some early oil produced by the international oil consortium , Azerbaijan International Operating Company ( AIOC ) , is due to move through the Russian pipeline route which passes across Chechnya . 
the AIOC has a deal with Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft to carry its oil to Novorossiisk in the Black Sea by the beginning of October . 
but questions over the security of oil moving across the war-ravaged region , pipeline tariffs and the condition of the pipeline itself have blocked an agreement between the two sides until now . 
Khozhakhmed Yarikhanov , president of Chechnya &apos;s Southern Oil Company , said last month that repairs to the Chechen section of the pipeline , running from the Caspian Sea to Russian export outlets in the Black Sea , could be finished in 20 to 30 days if $ 2 million financing was found . 
Russia &apos;s First Deputy Prime Minister said he was confident the money could be raised from Russian private business , adding that a deal on oil transportation across Chechnya was key to the region &apos;s economic development .
