U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday brushed aside critical comments made about him by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien , saying it would not affect their relationship . 
&quot; He &apos;s a superior human being , &quot; Clinton said during a chat with reporters as he travelled to Denmark from Romania . 
&quot; He &apos;s a very fine , a very great leader . 
during the NATO summit in Madrid earlier this week , Chretien made some stinging comments about Clinton as he and others waited for the U.S. president to show up for a photo call . 
in unguarded remarks to Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene , Chretien was overheard criticising Clinton for approving only three new NATO members and not five , as Canada and others had hoped . 
&quot; It &apos;s not for reasons of security , &quot; Chretien was reported to have said . 
&quot; It &apos;s all done for short-term political reasons to win elections . 
Chretien &apos;s comments , made in French , were picked up by a microphone left on inadvertently near the two prime ministers , who were unaware their conversation was being recorded . 
&quot; You know , this is just not going to bother me , &quot; Clinton said , joking that he would &quot; get even &quot; on the golf course . 
the two leaders have played golf together in Washington . 
a senior U.S. official said White House National Security Adviser Samuel Berger had been upset by the remarks and was even angrier when a Canadian official tried to describe the comments as something &quot; said affectionately &quot; .
