fifty years ago on August 15 the frail man who led India to freedom spent his day fasting , spinning and praying for peace . 
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi , called &quot; Mahatma &quot; or &quot; great soul &quot; by millions of followers , was in Calcutta trying to calm frenzied Moslems and Hindus who were slaughtering one another . 
Gandhi had arrived in the eastern city six days ahead of India &apos;s &quot; tryst with destiny &quot; , its independence after nearly 200 years of British rule . 
in New Delhi , a subcontinent away from Calcutta , stands a palatial mansion in whose grounds Gandhi was killed by a Hindu gunman five months after independence . 
it stands as quiet today as it was on that far-away day . 
Birla House , now a memorial to Gandhi , is set in a sprawling garden , shaded with shrubs and massive trees . 
on Thursdsay , a group of freedom fighters , who arrived in the Indian capital to take part in the 50th anniversary of the country &apos;s independence , broke down in tears as they moved around the memorial . 
M. Venkataramani , 77 , supporting himself with a walking stick , wiped his cheeks as he stood at the spot where Gandhi fell to Nathuram Vinayak Godse &apos;s bullets on January 30 , 1948 . 
&quot; I still feel agony at the thought that he was shot , &quot; said Venkataramani , who spent more than six years in jail for defying British rule as a freedom fighter . 
&quot; We are proud to be here , proud for what we have achieved , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Now we are shedding tears of blood for this country , for the way it is saddled with poverty , corruption , casteism and terrorism . 
R. Sundaram , 76 , who joined the Indian National Army of charismatic leader Subhas Chandra Bose , said he was happy to be alive to see the independence anniversary . 
&quot; But I still feel India is not fully independent , &quot; the sprightly former soldier said . 
Pratibha Nigam , who works at the memorial &apos;s bookstall , said sales at this time were better than in the past . 
&quot; Gandhi &apos;s sayings , thoughts and his autobiography are the most sought after , &quot; she said . 
for Gandhi , the house built by industrialist Ghanshyam Das Birla became the equivalent to an &quot; ashram &quot; or spiritual abode where he led daily prayer meetings and created homespun cotton on a &quot; charkha &quot; or spinning wheel . 
Gandhi , who himself wore a piece of coarse cloth spun by his own hands , also spent August 15 , 1947 , at the spinning wheel as he described in a letter to Agatha Harrison , a friend in Calcutta . 
you know my way of celebrating great events such as today &apos;s is to thank God for it and therefore to pray , &quot; Gandhi said in his letter . 
&quot; This prayer must be accompanied by a fast if the taking of fruit juices may be so described . 
and then as a mark of identification with the poor and dedicated , there must be spinning . 
some portions are either read to me or I glance during odd moments . 
what does it matter , who talks in my favour or against me if I myself am sound at bottom ? 
after all you and I have to do our duty in the best manner we know and keep on smiling ... I am about to finish my spinning . 
the letter was signed &quot; Bapu &quot; , a term of endearment meaning &quot; father &quot; that Indians still use to refer to Gandhi .
