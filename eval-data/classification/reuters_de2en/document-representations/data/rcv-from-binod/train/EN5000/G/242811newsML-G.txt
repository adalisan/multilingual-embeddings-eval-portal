leg spinner Anil Kumble and medium-pacer Javagal Srinath exploited an uneven pitch to bowl South Africa out for 177 in their first innings , giving India a 60-run lead on the second day of their third test on Monday . 
Kumble claimed four for 71 and Srinath three for 42 as South Africa were bundled out in reply to India &apos;s first innings score of 237 . 
but South African paceman Fannie De Villiers struck back immediately to claim opener Woorkeri Raman leg before wicket for two and leave India seven for one at close . 
South Africa were cruising smoothly at 121 for three before a middle order collapse saw them lose four wickets in the space of 30 balls and 10 runs against some incisive bowling . 
Kumble engineered the collapse by having Darryl Cullinan caught brilliantly for 29 at first slip by Mohammed Azharuddin off a fastish leg break , and Hansie Cronje caught by substitute Vangipurappu Laxman at mid-on for 15 . 
Srinath , returning for his last spell of the day after tea , bowled Brian McMillan for one with an in-cutter , yorked Dave Richardson for four and had Lance Klusener caught by Rahul Dravid at point to add to the visitors &apos; woes . 
Kumble trapped Fanie de Villers leg before for six and Paul Adams was run out for eight to close an innings in which a defiant Pat Symcox remained not out on 23 in 73 minutes , including a six off Kumble over long-on . 
Offspinner Aashish Kapoor applied the early brakes for India when he bowled Herschelle Gibbs for 17 through a bat-pad gap and Peter Kirsten , who made an elegant 43 , fell to a fine catch by Raman at forward short-leg . 
earlier , India , overnight 204 for six wickets , were all out at the end of a fine spell by spinner Adams , who returned with a career best six for 55 . 
Adams , playing only his fifth test , added three wickets on Monday to the middle-order scalps he claimed on Sunday . 
skipper Sachin Tendulkar , who made 61 , hit Adams for three quick boundaries before mistiming a lofted shot to De Villiers at cover . 
Kapoor was caught by De Villiers in the covers for 11 off Adams and Srinath fell without scoring to a brilliant diving return catch by the Bowler .
