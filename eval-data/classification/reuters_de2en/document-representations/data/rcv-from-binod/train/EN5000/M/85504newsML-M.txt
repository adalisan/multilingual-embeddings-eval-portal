Irish government bonds made further gains on Monday although trade was modest as the market took a breather after the previous week &apos;s frenetic advance , dealers said . 
they said some short-term profit taking was possible , although the continued strength of the Irish pound would be supportive of the market . 
Irish credit growth and government borrowing data released later this week was also expected to be broadly supportive , they said . 
&quot; Foreign investors are not so prevalent today , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; The short end still seems popular and we &apos;ve seen a bit more foreign buying of the shorts , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But the 10-year area seems to have run into a bit of a wall for the moment at 90 ( basis points ) over Germany . 
by 1540 GMT the eight percent bond due 2000 was up nine pence at 106.15 to yield 6.14 percent . 
the eight percent bond due 2006 was up 20p at 107.15 to yield 6.85 percent . 
&quot; We had phenomenal turnover last week and it &apos;s left the market a little hungover in terms of turnover today , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; All European markets are seeing people pausing for breath a little bit . 
dealers said the 10-year spread over Germany was unlikely to narrow further until spreads at the shorter-end had narrowed . 
&quot; You &apos;ll have to see good narrowing of spreads in the shorts before the 10-year will go again , &quot; one said . 
during the day the NTMA redeemed 71.4 million punts of the 8.5 percent bond due 1996 and 412.0 million of the variable-rate bond due 1996 , and dealers said it was surprising that the National Treasury Management Agency ( NTMA ) had not announced a tap issue . 
&quot; A good chunk of cash has come in to the market today but there &apos;s still no sign of the NTMA rolling-over the debt . 
they are very comfortable with their funding position and this is probably the best explanation for their no-show to date , &quot; one said .
