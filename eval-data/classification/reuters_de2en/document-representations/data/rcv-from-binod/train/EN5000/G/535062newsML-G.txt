an envoy of Mobutu Sese Seko has met Deputy President Thabo Mbeki to convey the Zairean president &apos;s response to an invitation to peace talks in South Africa , a South African government spokesman said on Thursday . 
the foreign affairs spokesman said Honore Ngabanda met Mbeki in Johannesburg on Wednesday night but he declined to give details of the talks . 
the spokesman said Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and his deputy minister Aziz Pahad were both scheduled to address parliament in Cape Town later on Thursday and the Zairean response would be spelled out in their speeches . 
President Nelson Mandela formally invited Mobutu last week to come to South Africa to meet rebel leader Laurent Kabila , whose forces now control more than half of Zaire , including its major mineral resources . 
Mobutu &apos;s son has since said his father , who is being treated for prostate cancer , is too ill to travel to South Africa .
