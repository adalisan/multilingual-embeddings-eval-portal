the daughter of Albania &apos;s late communist dictator Enver Hoxha has filed a libel suit against the daily newspaper Dita Informacion over a story about her husband , who has been detained on suspicion of having links with a guerrilla group , the paper said on Tuesday . 
the independent paper said Pranvera Hoxha was suing its owner , Shpetim Nazarko , and its editor-in-chief , Mentor Nazarko , over the October 27 article which related to her husband Klement Kolaneci &apos;s legal battle . 
the paper said it did not as yet know any details about the suit , which was filed at a Tirana court . 
it said a judge had been nominated but no date had been set for the trial . 
no one at the paper or at the court was available for further comment . 
Kolaneci was arrested last month after Albanian police said they had busted a guerrilla organisation of former secret police members . 
Interior Minister Halit Shamata said Kolaneci had been detained after money believed to have been stolen by the group was found at his home . 
the Hoxha family has been involved in several legal tussles since the Balkan nation &apos;s communist regime was toppled in December 1990 . 
Hoxha &apos;s widow Nexhmije , 75 , was jailed for 12 years in 1993 on embezzlement charges , but her term was later reduced . 
Ilir , her eldest son , was imprisoned for one year for inciting hatred after publicly denouncing the ruling Democratic Party leaders .
