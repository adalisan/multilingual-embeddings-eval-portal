the left will not only sweep the Mexico City mayor &apos;s election July 6 but will also win the majority of congressional seats in the capital and could control the city &apos;s legislative assembly , according to an opinion poll published Thursday . 
the poll , conducted by Berumen y Asociados , coincided with other recent surveys in showing left-wing veteran Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) heading for a landslide victory in the capital . 
it put Cardenas on 40 percent , followed by Alfredo del Mazo of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( pri ) on 22 percent and Carlos Castillo Peraza of the conservative National Action Party ( PAN ) with 15 percent . 
seven percent were voting for other small parties and 15 percent either did not know or did not plan to vote . 
for the first time , Berumen said , respondents said they actually believed the PRD would win , independent of whom they planned to vote for . 
previous surveys had always shown people thought the pri would win . 
&quot; What we are seeing is that the PRD vote seems to be solid in Mexico City , &quot; , pollster Edmundo Berumen told Reuters . 
&quot; There will not be much differential voting in the capital . 
since Mexico City has 30 of the 300 electoral districts for the lower house of Congress , the result means the pri will need a very good showing elsewhere in the country if it is to keep the lower house majority it has held for 68 unbroken years . 
the Berumen poll was carried out between June 21-23 on two samples of 1,250 residents . 
no margin of error was given .
