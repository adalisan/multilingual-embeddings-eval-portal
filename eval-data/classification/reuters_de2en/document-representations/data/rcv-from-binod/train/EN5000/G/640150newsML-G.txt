Federal agents are investigating allegations of electoral fraud in Dallas County and are focusing on whether non-citizens voted in recent elections here , officials said on Thursday . 
U.S. Attorney Paul Coggins said the investigation was at a preliminary stage and the FBI had been called in to help . 
&quot; We are conducting a probe to determine if there was voting by non-citizens in recent elections and , if there was , how widespread it was and if it was coordinated , &quot; Coggins said . 
&quot; If we find it was widespread or that it was coordinated , we almost certainly would expand the investigation and ask the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice to get involved , &quot; he told Reuters . 
Coggins said information pointing to possible voter fraud came from the Immigration and Naturalisation Service , but he declined to give specific details .
