Japan needs to implement sweeping structural changes , including opening its markets , cutting red tape and encouraging corporate restructuring to boost productivity , a research study prepared for the Commerce Department says . 
&quot; Unless Japan seriously undertakes deregulation and corporate restructuring , it can expect to face reduced economic growth and limited flexibility for change in the longer term , &quot; said the paper , prepared under the guidance of Everett Ehrlich , Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs . 
the study says there is &quot; massive potential &quot; for U.S. exporters in Japan once it eventually opens its markets . 
the Commerce study says that Japan faces several issues that , if not addressed , could lead a permanent slowdown in growth instead of just a cyclical downturn . 
they range from banking problems that hurt domestic investment to longer-run issues , such as an aging Labor force , a more costly yen and the need for deregulation , that will determine growth prospects . 
&quot; larger homes would allow the Japanese to buy more goods : at least there would be someplace to put things when you brought them home , &quot; the study said , &quot; Again , the result is growth . 
it also urged more &quot; openness &quot; in Japanese economic activity , including reform of what it termed outmoded and inefficient Japanese corporate organization that emphasize integrated operations instead of making use of specialized and efficient suppliers to keep costs and prices down .
