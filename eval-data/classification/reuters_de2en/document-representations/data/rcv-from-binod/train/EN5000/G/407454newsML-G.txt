government forces and Khmer Rouge guerrillas clashed on Wednesday and Thursday in northern Cambodia , where officials were trying to persuade the rebels and their feared leader Ta Mok to defect , an army commander said . 
&quot; Fighting between government troops and 400-500 guerrillas under Ta Mok has been taking place for two days , &quot; General Long Sereirath , a deputy military regional commander based in the northwest province of Siem Reap , said on Thursday . 
he said the fighting was centred on Sa Em in the northern province of Preah Vihear . 
long Sereirath called it the first major military operation against the guerrillas this year , but MEAs Sophea , the Cambodian armed forces deputy chief of staff , said the fighting was not major and there was no news on casualties . 
TA Mok commands fewer than 2,000 hardline Khmer Rouge guerrillas from the northern base of Anlong Veng , military officials said . 
the one-legged guerrilla commander has been in radio contact with military officials in Siem Reap for the past two weeks , since a party of 15 pilots and negotiators , including provincial deputy governor Hem Bunheng , flew by helicopter into hardline territory on February 14 . 
the delegation has not returned to Siem Reap but is reported to be in radio contact with the government . 
Co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh has stressed that they are not hostages but are negotiating for Ta Mok and his men to defect . 
&quot; Still they are in good health . 
I hope that they will come back ... as soon as possible , &quot; Ranariddh said on Thursday , adding : &quot; It &apos;s not a serious problem at all . 
it was unclear whether the fighting would affect negotiations with one of the most notorious figures of the Khmer Rouge , whose 1975-79 rule left more than one million people dead . 
the Khmer Rouge reneged on a U.N.-brokered 1991 peace pact and has been fighting the coalition formed after 1993 elections . 
the Maoist-inspired movement split last August and has since been crippled by thousands of defections , leaving only the Anlong Veng hardliners holding out . 
the government has said it wants a peaceful solution .
