Hizbollah attacked the Lebanese government &apos;s budget policies on Thursday , accusing it of proposing unrealistic spending plans to parliament and then massively exceeding them . 
Ammar Moussawi , one of the pro-Iranian group &apos;s seven deputies , told parliament the 1997 draft budget did not reflect government financial policy because most investment spending took place outside the budget and was financed by foreign debt . 
speaking on the second day of the annual budget debate , he called the government &apos;s proposal fragile and said its spending and deficit ceilings did not inspire confidence . 
&quot; Last year &apos;s experience was not encouraging since spending exceeded its ceiling by more than 700 billion Lebanese pounds ( $ 450 million ) and the planned 35 percent deficit ( of revenue against expenditure ) jumped to 51 percent , &quot; Moussawi said . 
the 1996 deficit target was in fact 37.6 percent but the actual deficit reached 51 percent due to damage caused by a heavy Israeli attack on Lebanon in April and a slowdown of economic growth during the year . 
however , the deficit also overran government targets in 1994 and 1995 of 43 per cent and 44 percent , reaching 57 percent and 47 percent respectively , and accusations have intensified that the government routinely presents unrealistic budgets . 
pro-government deputies dominate the 128-member parliament and it is expected to approve the budget on Saturday despite the tough criticisms during the first two days of the debate . 
the draft proposes expenditures of 6,433 billion pounds and revenues of 4,100 billion pounds -- a deficit of about 36 percent . 
proposed spending is slightly lower than 1996 projections and planned revenue is slightly higher . 
Moussawi warned the government against increasing taxes to reduce the deficit . 
referring to media reports of possible increases of petrol and electricity prices , he said : &quot; We warn that this could lead to a wide popular explosion . 
he proposed instead the introduction of progressive taxation to replace the current 10 percent flat rate for income and corporate tax . 
in another attack on the government , Hassan Alawiyyeh , a Shi &apos;ite Moslem deputy , told parliament Lebanon &apos;s indebtedness was reaching a dangerous level . 
&quot; This budget depends mainly on domestic and foreign debt and debt figures have touched the red line , threatening negative implications for future generations , &quot; Alawiyyeh said . 
foreign and domestic debt have risen sharply in the past four years because much of Lebanon &apos;s multi-billion-dollar reconstruction drive is being carried out through foreign borrowing while the budget deficit is financed by heavy domestic borrowing . 
foreign and net domestic debt have each more than doubled since December 1994 . 
foreign debt has risen to $ 1.769 billion from $ 772 million and net domestic debt to 13,315 billion Lebanese pounds from 6,682 billion . 
total debt reached $ 10.348 billion at end of December 1996 , a figure which according to one parliamentary deputy approaches Lebanon &apos;s estimated annual gross domestic product . 
( $ 1 = 1,549.75 Lebanese pounds )
