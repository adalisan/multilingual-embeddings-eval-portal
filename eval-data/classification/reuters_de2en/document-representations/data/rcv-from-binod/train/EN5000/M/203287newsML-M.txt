tight stocks of wheat coupled with a technical recovery boosted CBOT wheat futures to a strongly higher close with nearby December surging over 75 percent of the daily trading limit , traders said . 
the session high for December was $ 4.15 per bushel , the highest level for that contract since $ 4.17-1 / 2 was set on October 17 . 
&quot; The domestic wheat supplies are pretty tight . 
throughout the fall farmer movement has been light , &quot; said skip Searcy , wheat trading specialist for Chicago-based trade house FIMAT futures . 
talk was widespread that Nabisco , ConAgra and Continental grain hold most if not all of the deliverable-grade wheat and will use it for domestic milling purposes . 
that would keep wheat out of the delivery market and contribute further strength to the bull spreads . 
Friday , November 29 is first notice day for deliveries on the CBOT December . 
&quot; The deliverable stocks are being depleted and funds are short big amounts of wheat and all of it is up front ... the fight &apos;s on , &quot; Searcy said . 
wheat closed 2-1 / 4 to 15-1 / 2 cents per bushel higher , with December up 15-1 / 2 at $ 4.13-1 / 4 . 
as of Wednesday there were 3,682,652 million bushels of wheat registered in Toledo for potential delivery and 20,202 bushels in Chicago . 
but &quot; there &apos;s only 1.5 million bushels that are uncommitted , &quot; a trader said and &quot; that may be gone by now . 
&quot; The stocks are tight and they &apos;re saying very little if any deliveries a week from Friday , &quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds . 
wheat futures volume was estimated at 18,000 contracts , above the 13,663 traded Tuesday , according to the CBOT . 
wheat options volume was estimated at 4,000 contracts , above the 3,281 traded Tuesday .
