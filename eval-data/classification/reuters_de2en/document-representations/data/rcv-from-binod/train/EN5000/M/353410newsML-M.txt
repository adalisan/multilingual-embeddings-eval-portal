the Zimbabwe dollar closed Tuesday &apos;s trading session largely unchanged against major currencies , kept in the slow track by lack of pressure on the domestic market . 
&quot; Many companies are still sorting out their positions , trying to find their way around after the holidays ... and there is very little trade going on , &quot; one foreign exchange dealer said . 
&quot; It &apos;s normal for this time of the year and of the month , and it should be another few days before we get into the fast track , &quot; he added . 
the Zimbabwe dollar was quoted at 10.9525 / 9625 against the U.S. dollar -- the same level at which it opened the day -- from Monday &apos;s closing rate of 10.9500 / 9600 . 
it also ended Tuesday stable at 2.4200 / 4400 from 2.4151 / 4189 versus South Africa &apos;s rand and at 6.6700 / 6900 compared to 6.6415 / 6504 against the German mark . 
against pound sterling , the Zimbabwe dollar closed at 17.7400 / 7600 after opening at 17.7370 / 7620 and from 17.5492 / 5762 overnight .
