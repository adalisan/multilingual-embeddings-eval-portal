Britain &apos;s customs service said on Wednesday it had arrested more than 40 people and seized shedloads of spirits in a nationwide crackdown on smuggling . 
&quot; It &apos;s the largest operation we have ever mounted , &quot; said Ranald Macdonald , spokesman for the National Investigation Service of Customs and Excise . 
five hundred officers from the service -- which chases drugs and criminal fraud -- spread across England overnight , issuing warrants from Newcastle in the north to Poole in the south . 
more than 40 men and women , all British-based , were arrested . 
one hundred homes and businesses were inspected and &quot; huge &quot; consignments of smuggled beers , wines and spirits seized in warehouses around London , said Macdonald . 
he estimated the cigarette and alcohol fraud , carried out by two inter-connected criminal gangs , had cost Britain more than 65 million pounds ( $ 109 million ) in lost revenue . 
the alleged fraud was three-pronged , taking advantage of different tax levels both within the European Union and beyond . 
the discrepancy has already spawned a huge legal trade in alcohol as Britons take daytrips to France to pack up their cars with beer and wine and avoid higher duties at home . 
MacDonald said the two gangs had either bought duty-free goods that were intended for export but failed to export them , smuggled in low-price goods from the continent or else recovered duty paid on beer by falsely claiming it was to be sold abroad . 
&quot; They &apos;re variations on the same theme and they all represent concentrated attacks on the revenue system , &quot; said Macdonald .
