U.S. municipal bonds in early trade Wednesday were flat , and the tone remained edgy and cautious due to the market &apos;s big drop , most of which occurred Friday . 
that kept the lid on activity in outstanding bonds . 
&quot; At the very least ( participants ) want to see how the market shakes itself out after Friday &apos;s disaster , &quot; a trader said . 
he speculated prices might firm slightly , provided the Treasury &apos;s sale of $ 12 billion of 10-year bonds goes smoothly . 
Tuesday &apos;s sale of three-year notes went largely as expected . 
&quot; My guess is ( municipal ) futures will be a little bit better unless the auction comes out today and is lousy . 
there might be bottom-fishing , &quot; the trader said . 
while there was considerable selling interest for the two-week period leading up to last Friday , the market &apos;s retreat since then has sharply curtailed such activity . 
the main yardstick of the secondary market , the Standard and Poor &apos;s Blue List totaled $ 1.475 billion , up slightly . 
the focus stayed firmly on new issues , as it has been for most of the week . 
new Jersey traders , who recently have seen few sales , were looking forward to the sale of $ 40 million of general obligations by Monmouth County . 
and a New Jersey Health Agency next week plans to sell $ 191 million of new money and refunding bonds , according to book-runner , Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co . 
negotiated offerings for Wednesday were expected to total $ 738 million in 17 sales , with a $ 215 million South Carolina Public Facilities offering through Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. topping the list . 
on the competitive side , 15 sales totaling $ 211 million were scheduled . 
new issues drew mixed results on Tuesday , as the New York City Water Finance Authority through PaineWebber sold $ 289 million of revenue bonds , which were repriced , with the top yield in 2021 rising to 5.50 percent from 5.474 percent . 
the Authority had hoped to sell as much as $ 365 million of debt , but reduced the offering due to the market &apos;s volatility . 
it was forced to reprice the bonds both for retail investors during a presale period , and for institutional buyers . 
JP Morgan Securities won $ 240 million Georgia bonds at a net interest cost of 4.7584 percent . 
the noncallable deal was rated triple-A by Moody &apos;s Investors Service , Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s Corp and Fitch Investors Service . 
in Chicago futures markets , September municipal futures shed three ticks to 120-10 / 32 . 
September Treasury futures slipped two ticks to 114-17 / 32 . 
this left the mob spread between the futures contracts down one tick from late Tuesday . 
in secondary activity , Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority , Massachusetts , bonds of 2024 , which pay a five percent coupon , were bid at 5.45 percent , net , unchanged . 
and Municipal Electricity Authority , Georgia , bonds of 2026 , which carry a five percent coupon , were offered at 5.35 percent , net , unchanged .
