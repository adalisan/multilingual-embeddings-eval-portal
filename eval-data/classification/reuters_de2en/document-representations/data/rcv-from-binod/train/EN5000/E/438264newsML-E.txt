following are some comments made by economists on Swedish consumer prices in February . 
Swedish consumer prices fell 0.1 percent in February from January , while market expectations pointed to an increase of 0.2 percent , according to a Reuter poll . 
the EU-harmonised CPI was unchanged in the month , Statistics Sweden said on Wednesday . 
&quot; It was unusual . 
interest rates should have contributed positively to the figure . 
there must be a weakness somewhere else , perhaps in electricity or food . 
I think the Riksbank ( the central bank ) will continue lowering the key repo rate but that it is hampered by the soft crown . 
an annual fall of 0.4 percent is considerably better than market expectations . 
despite high activity in some parts of the economy , the figure shows Sweden has a low tendency to inflation . 
there is still some room for lower yields in Sweden . 
consumption is still low . 
that prices do not rise must mean there is no room to raise margins . 
the difference between expected and real figures is due to many underlying components still being weak . 
a rate cut won &apos;t be delivered before the next inflation report . 
the Riksbank is also pressured by the soft crown . 
&quot; It was a big surprise . 
the interest rate effect seems to be lasting longer than most had expected . 
during the past six months inflation has constantly been lower than forecasts . 
this is also the case this month when we had expected a rise of 0.25 percent in February . 
the interest rate effect will be there another couple of months , and as the interest rate costs are not in the net costs and the EU-harmonised CPI , this indicates very low total price increase levels . 
inflation currently seems to be completely absent from the Swedish economy .
