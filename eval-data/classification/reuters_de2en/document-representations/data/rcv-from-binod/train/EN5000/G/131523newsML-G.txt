with only 16 days before Election Day , Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole on Sunday stepped up his attacks on Democratic Party fundraising tactics and called for a ban on all campaign contributions from non-U.S. citizens . 
but President Bill Clinton , still leading Dole on all major polls , stayed mum on the issue , focusing instead on helping Democratic congressional candidates raise several million dollars to boost their prospects on Nov 5 . 
Clinton began a four-day , five-state campaign trip designed to help Democrats win back the Republican-controlled Congress and boost his own re-election effort . 
in a tough speech at Daniel Webster College in Nashua , New Hampshire , Dole said foreign interests were trying to buy White House access through big donations to the Democrats . 
he also took on the AFL-CIO labour union and its $ 35 million advertising campaign to elect Democrats to Congress , saying lawmakers should ban the use of compulsory union dues for political purposes . 
the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) is under fire for accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in questionable campaign contributions from individuals with ties to the Lippo Group , an Indonesian real estate and banking conglomerate . 
Senator John McCain , R-Arizona , called for a special prosecutor and an independent counsel to investigate the DNC fundraising flap , saying it raised questions on whether this influenced Clinton &apos;s policies toward the Suharto government . 
DNC officials on Friday removed fundraiser John Huang , who formerly worked for the Lippo Group , and asked the Federal Election Commission to investigate charges about some of the donations he brought in . 
Republicans called on the Democrats to return $ 425,000 in contributions from an Indonesian couple with ties to the Lippo Group , Arief and Soraya Wiriadinata , as well as $ 140,000 raised at a Buddhist temple in California . 
Arief Wiriadinata worked as a landscaper in Virginia . 
Clinton began his day by praying with Senate candidate Bob Torricelli at the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark , New Jersey , and exhorting the mostly black congregation to vote . 
after church , Clinton drummed up about $ 800,000 in campaign contributions in Teaneck , New Jersey , for Torricelli , who is running neck-and-neck with Republican Richard Zimmer for the Senate seat vacated by retiring Democrat Bill Bradley . 
Clinton was to attend four more fundraisers for Democratic candidates later on Sunday in New York state , expected to raise roughly $ 3 million to $ 4 million , and at least one fundraiser each in Ohio , Michigan and Florida . 
the president has mentioned the fundraising uproar only once , saying only that he asked the DNC to review all donations and assure that they were appropriate . 
but Clinton &apos;s aides were busy on Sunday trying to diffuse the crisis . 
White House chief of staff Leon Panetta denied any wrongdoing , dismissed the Republican attack as hypocrisy and said it was a negative tactic that would not help Dole . 
in New Hampshire , Dole said if elected he would create a bipartisan panel to recommend an overhaul of campaign finance reform laws . 
Clinton led Dole by 8.3 percent in the daily Reuters tracking poll of 900 likely voters , getting 44.9 percent to Dole &apos;s 36.6 percent , and ended three days of gains by Dole . 
the poll was conducted by the John Zogby Group International Thursday through Saturday and has a 3.3 percentage point margin of error . 
Republicans want a broad probe into the foreign donations , which House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich calls &quot; the largest scandal to affect the presidency in the history of the United States . 
Panetta told NBC-TV &apos;s &quot; meet the Press &quot; programme the Republicans also accepted campaign contributions from foreign backers . 
Federal election laws allow foreign citizens who are residents of the United States to make political contributions even though they are not eligible to vote .
