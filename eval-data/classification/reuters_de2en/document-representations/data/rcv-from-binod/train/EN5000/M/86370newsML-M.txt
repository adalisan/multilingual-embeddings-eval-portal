Danish share prices closed higher on Monday in a market with optimistic undertone buoyed by a strong dollar , positive bonds and overseas bourses and seemingly poised for further gains . 
&quot; The general undertone is still positive so even if activity remains somewhat on the subdued side , we should push upwards tomorrow again bolstered by more active foreign investors , &quot; one dealer said . 
the KFX top-20 index gained 0.74 point to 123.47 in overall bourse turnover of 789 million crowns . 
the KFX index closing level was a new high , beating the previous end-of-day record of 122.80 set on September 26 . 
Carlsberg closed five crowns higher at 355 probably boosted by the morning announcement that it had increased its stake in Swedish brewer Falcon to a 50 percent shareholding . 
otherwise banks were mixed with Unibank putting on one crown to finish at 280 , while rival Den Danske shed three crowns to end at 427 . 
FLS Industries climbed on flushed by solid demand , closing 10 crowns up at 760 with dealers expecting more gains ahead .
