Italian port authorities said on Saturday they had been searching the Malta-Sicily channel since December 26 for signs of a collision between ships carrying illegal immigrants , but had so far found nothing . 
&quot; Malta asked us on December 26 to look into a possible collision between a big ship and a smaller one but nothing has been found , though we are still looking , &quot; a spokesman for the Italian navy rescue coordination centre said . 
Massimo Grisetti , spokesman for Italy &apos;s naval rescue coordination centre , said Italy was conducting its search in coordination with Malta . 
Greece &apos;s marine ministry said on Saturday it was probing testimony by detained illegal immigrants who said scores of people had been lost at sea on Christmas Day when ships collided in the Malta-Sicily channel . 
Greece said that according to the testimony , the cargo ship Yoham , flying a Honduras flag , struck a smaller ship after 320 of the immigrants had transferred from the Yoham to the smaller vessel and only about 30 people were rescued . 
Italy , which has a growing illegal immigration problem , said on Friday that a Tunisian man had drowned off the island of Lampedusa south of Sicily after the boat he and 39 others were travelling in sank in rough seas .
