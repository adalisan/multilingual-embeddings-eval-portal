Mediterranean oil products were largely at the mercy of speculative activity in the New York futures market on Thursday , traders said . 
gas oil slid $ 1.75 a tonne to $ 169.25 as U.S. players engaged in a hefty sell-off of NYMEX gasoline ahead of the August contract &apos;s expiry . 
gasoline finished steady in a turbulent market that initially saw stronger numbers and then gains wiped out by the U.S. selling . 
dealers said the fundamentals of a tight gasoline market in the Mediterranean remained . 
very little product was seen available to meet expected demand . 
traders said word that Iraq &apos;s aid distribution plan could be approved by this weekend appeared good news for Med refiners whose struggle to boost margins has been blighted by a narrow heating oil / diesel spread . 
but gas oil business remained quiet with buyers and sellers in a standoff . 
Russian heating oil remained notionally assessed at around high CIF Med + 1.50 / 2.50 CIF Genoa . 
fuel oil ignored futures . 
utility demand was very limited but some bunker demand continued in Italy . 
traders were showing Italian high sulphur barrels , apparently in a manoeuvre to push quotes lower ahead of purchase pricing periods , but values were static amid otherwise slow business . 
black Sea one percent cargoes from the Russian system were being worked into Italian refineries , traders added .
