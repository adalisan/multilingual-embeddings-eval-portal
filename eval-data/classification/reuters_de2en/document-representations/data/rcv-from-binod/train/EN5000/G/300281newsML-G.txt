police seeking out child pornography networks arrested one man and seized hundreds of tapes in a series of raids across Belgium , Belga news agency said on Friday . 
Belga said the 45-year old man was being held along with some 1,000 video tapes , CD-ROMs and cameras following the raids on Thursday at about 60 premises . 
no one was immediately available at the Brussels Court to confirm the report . 
Belgium , in the aftermath of a child sex and murder scandal that shook the country , has clamped down on child pornography on the Internet and set up a police unit to monitor it . 
Court spokesman Josef Colpin told Reuters on Thursday that the raids were launched on the basis of information received from French and British authorities . 
Belgium has been in turmoil since the sex and murder case emerged in mid-August with the arrest of convicted rapist Marc Dutroux . 
two sexually-abused girls were rescued from a dungeon in one of his houses and police subsequently discovered the bodies of four more . 
Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo , both aged eight , had been missing since June 1995 . 
Dutroux said they starved to death early last year . 
their bodies were found buried with that of a former Dutroux accomplice , Frenchman Bernard Weinstein , on another property belonging to Dutroux elsewhere in the central city of Charleroi . 
Dutroux , who was released on parole in 1992 after serving three years of a 13-year sentence for multiple child rape , has admitted murdering Weinstein . 
the bodies of teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks , missing for a year , were unearthed in early September at another property in Charleroi connected with Dutroux . 
more than 250,000 people marched through Brussels last October to demonstrate support for victims of the paedophile ring and vent their anger at the legal and political system . 
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene met parents of the children on Thursday night to review progress on promises made by him for wide-ranging reforms . 
&quot; The four projects that correspond to the parents &apos; concerns will be voted through before parliament goes on holiday ( in the summer ) , &quot; Dehaene later told reporters . 
these included giving more help to victims of crime , as well as de-politicising the magistrate system and reviewing the execution of sentences . 
work would also be done to set up a private centre to deal with cases of missing children . 
a special parliamentary commission is investigating the handling of past police searches for the dead girls . 
its chairman , Marc Verwilghen , said earlier this week it was obvious that , had it not been for bungling by police and magistrates , the girls would be alive today . 
there have been allegations Dutroux &apos;s gang was only able to operate so long -- even though he was under secret surveillance by gendarmes -- because Dutroux had high-level protection . 
police on Thursday ended a fruitless three-week underground search at an abandoned coal mining complex in Charleroi , where they have been looking for signs of several other missing children , including bodies . 
they had been alerted to the site by Dutroux &apos; second wife Michelle Martin who , along with three other people , is also being held in prison while enquiries continue . 
searches will continue next week above ground at the site .
