U.S. copper is still buoyed by decent demand , but it was too early to say if current good metal supplies stemmed solely from holiday shutdowns or were a sign of gathering surpluses , traders and producers said . 
&quot; Most of current demand is being met from current production , &quot; a physical trader said . 
&quot; The good business we saw in the fourth quarter is continuing into the first quarter . 
another trader added , &quot; I don &apos;t believe there is any problem with supply . 
the large 11,475-tonne LME stock hike Tuesday was mainly in Singapore , with some traders dismissing it as a &quot; one-off &quot; event . 
&quot; Singapore is unpredictable and just depends on people nobody knows much about , &quot; the physical trader said . 
an East Coast brass mill executive added , &quot; The interesting thing is what happens when people come back to work . 
that &apos;s going to give you your real long-term answer . 
spot business was said to be fairly quiet with January bookings all concluded and another week or so to go before February orders are placed . 
traders said much of the flow between rival exchanges &apos; warehouses had dried up for the time being because nearby LME and COMEX contracts were roughly even , leaving little arb trading opportunities . 
but U.S. supplies may ease further this quarter as Kennecott Utah copper was scheduled to finally bring up to full capacity its 310,000 short tons per year smelter . 
still , Kennecott remained cautious and its spokeswoman Alexis Fernandez said modifications to the problem-hit plant were continuing . 
&quot; We are not coming out with any detailed figures until the first quarter production figures come out , &quot; Fernandez added . 
scrap , however , is becoming more plentiful as sustained higher cathode prices have lured more secondary metal out of the woodwork . 
as a result , scrap &apos;s discount to cathode has widened a touch , merchants said . 
&quot; I think we will see people trying to maybe get away from cathodes and refined due to their closer relationship with COMEX prices , &quot; a Midwest scrap merchant said . 
some consumers had been using more cathode and less scrap because the price of the latter was so strong . 
exports of copper scrap have also eased as China enters its New Lunar Year holiday period , thereby helping to boost domestic availability . 
and China &apos;s insistence since November that scrap merchants pay an inspection fee to guarantee the quality of each container exported has had an negative effect . 
&quot; It &apos;s affecting our business - it &apos;s making us hesitant and not necessarily making us competitive , &quot; a West coast scrap exporter said . 
but one unknown which still lingers in the background is the outcome of protracted Labor talks at Phelps dodge Corp &apos;s Chino mine in New Mexico . 
workers at the 168,000 ton per year facility have been without Labor contracts for the past six months , and no new dates have been set for fresh talks , a Phelps spokeswoman said Monday .
