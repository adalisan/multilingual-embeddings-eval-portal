Canadian bonds opened weaker in quiet trade on Wednesday , taking much of their direction from U.S. treasuries , with the lingering weight of recent new issues also hurting prices , analysts said . 
&quot; We opened up unchanged then weakened off with the U.S. market . 
it definitely felt like there was fairly heavy selling pressure in Canada , even though volumes have been pretty light , &quot; said one bond trader with a bank-owned brokerage . 
the U.S. 30-year bond fell 4 / 32 to yield 6.73 percent . 
the spread between the bonds widened to three basis points from two basis points at Tuesday &apos;s close . 
Canadian and U.S. bond markets opened weaker this morning with consolidation and some profit taking happening in both markets . 
traders in both markets are also looking ahead to the release later this afternoon of the Fed Beige Book . 
in Canada , analysts said recent new issues which have not been fully distributed also continued to weigh on prices . 
both Ontario and Quebec recently tapped the domestic market for new borrowing . 
&quot; It may take a few more days to get all this product distributed because volumes have not really been all that high , &quot; the trader said . 
Canadian manufacturing and wholesale trade data for April released this morning had little impact on prices , dealers said . 
analysts said Canadian fixed-income markets are now looking ahead to a speech and news press conference by Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen in Quebec City . 
the negative spread between the bonds narrowed to 25 basis points from 26 basis points at Tuesday &apos;s close . 
the three-month cash T-bill yielded 2.83 percent against its U.S. equivalent which yielded 5.06 percent .
