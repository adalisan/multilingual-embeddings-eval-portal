Ernie Els romped into the World Matchplay final to give himself a chance of becoming the first player to win three successive titles when he thumped American Mark brooks by a near-record 10 and 8 on Saturday . 
the 27-year-old champion did not need to play well as brooks struggled on the soggy 6,957-yard West Course at Wentworth . 
apart from a burst of three birdies in four holes to close out the morning round , Els made only one other birdie on the first 26 holes before he birdied the 27th from nine feet and the 28th with a 25-foot putt to settle the match . 
&quot; I feel sorry for Mark because he didn &apos;t play well , &quot; Els said . 
the match finished far ahead of the second semifinal and Els had a long wait to know whether he would play British Open champion Tom Lehman or Vijay Singh of Fiji in Sunday &apos;s final . 
Els &apos;s margin of victory was the joint second largest in the 33-year history of the event behind Tom Watson &apos;s 11 and 9 destruction of South African Dale Hayes in 1978 and level with Arnold Palmer &apos;s 10 and 8 win over Roberto de Vicenzo in 1966 . 
&quot; hitting to the right is not usually a problem for me . 
brooks did not win a hole in the match and reached the greens in regulation only nine times in 28 holes . 
on all but the last two holes he was left with impossibly long putts . 
after the morning round , Els was already six holes ahead . 
while he himself had trailed by that margin against American Steve Stricker on Friday before winning at the last , a similar reversal was unlikely and so it proved .
