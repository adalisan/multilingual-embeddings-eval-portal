the report of a massive , unrecorded hoard of copper sitting in Rotterdam warehouses will probably continue to make base metal dealers on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) nervous , Singapore-based traders said on Friday . 
&quot; I believe that &apos;s ( the report on the copper cache ) right , &quot; Vinod Kumar , director of Singapore-based metal company Donald Mcarthy , told Reuters . 
other Singapore-based dealers were more skeptical , but conceded the report has made the market skittish . 
&quot; It shouldn &apos;t have an effect on the market , but it certainly seems to make the market jittery , &quot; a senior dealer in a Western metal trading company said , adding there seems to be &quot; no facts &quot; to support the existence of the copper cache in the Netherlands . 
another trader said that if the stocks did exist , why was the material not unloaded in the market when prices were hovering near US $ 3,000 a tonne . 
one effect of the report is that it calls into question whether the market should believe the substantial drawdown in stocks in LME warehouses , traders said . 
&quot; It &apos;s getting to the point where the stocks are directional but completely unbelievable , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; The stock figures should be basically ignored . 
with cash copper being quoted around $ 2,100 a tonne , &quot; material should be heading back to LME warehouses , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; The answer seems to be that stock figures are being manipulated . 
Singapore-based dealers were split on the copper stocks , with most traders thinking that it may fall by up to 10,000 tonnes while one trader insisted it would remain unchanged . 
&quot; copper should fall by about 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes , &quot; a trader for a Japanese metal dealing firm said . 
&quot; The copper drawdown should be in that region , &quot; another metal trader said . 
but a dealer in a metal trading firm said : &quot; I don &apos;t want to put any numbers on the stocks at the moment . 
it may be unchanged or even go up because something like 20,000 tonnes of copper is moving back to the LME warehouse in Singapore . 
&quot; Any strong drawdown will not make much of a difference because are nervous about that report , &quot; Kumar said . 
but other dealers said the market should quickly shrug off the effect of the copper cache report . 
&quot; What the market is really talking about is that the Chinese may be delivering up to 20,000 tonnes of copper back to Singapore , &quot; a trader said . 
aluminium will follow copper &apos;s lead in the LME later today , traders said . 
&quot; With copper coming down , many people are selling aluminium and the price should come down further , &quot; the aluminium dealer for a Japanese trading house said . 
another trader said aluminium stocks of up to 80,000 tonnes in China has knocked their buyers out of the market for the moment . 
three month copper prices were quoted in Singapore at around $ 2,023 / 28 a tonne at 0500 GMT against the late quote in London on Thursday of $ 2,018 / 20 a tonne , dealers said . 
aluminium prices were quoted here at about $ 1,425 / 30 a tonne at 0500 GMT against the late London quote of $ 1,428 a tonne , dealers said .
