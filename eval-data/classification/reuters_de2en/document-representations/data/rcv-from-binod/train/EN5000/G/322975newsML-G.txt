fires have razed at least 28 homes , destroyed forest and forced the evacuation of hundreds of people from their homes in and around a mountain range near the southern Australian city of Melbourne . 
emergency services said on Tuesday about 700 firefighters were battling six major blazes in the Dandenong mountain range in blistering temperatures of up to 38 degrees celcius ( 100 degrees Fahrenheit ) . 
&quot; We have officially recalled firefighters from the Metropolitan Fire Brigade ( MFB ) who were on ( early ) shift . 
there are still six major fires , &quot; MFB spokesman David Mann told Reuters . 
Mann said the flames , about 30 km ( 19 miles ) east of the city , continued to be fanned by strong , dry northerly winds . 
country Fire Authority spokesman Ian Hamilton said two other major fires were burning west and south-east of Melbourne but they were yet to threaten homes . 
Hamilton said there had been no injuries reported so far . 
Melbourne has been suffering sweltering conditions since Saturday , forcing organisers at the Australian Open tennis tournament on Tuesday to take the unprecedented step of closing the retractable roof on the centre after players said they feared for their health after playing in the extreme heat . 
players said they feared for their health after court temperaturs soared to 50 degrees ( 122 degrees Fahrenheit ) on Sunday and Monday . 
the heatwave has prompted one Melbourne public swimming pool to stay open for 24 hours to meet a surge in demand . 
a cold front is approaching from the west of Victoria and would reach the mountains in the evening but Hamilton said it would provide little relief as it was not expected to bring rain . 
it is not known what caused the fires . 
national communications carrier Telstra Corp said its triple-zero emergency telephone lines had been jammed with calls about the fires .
