COMEX copper ended firmer , drawing confidence from an LME relieved that its December options declaration passed without the turmoil some had expected . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think the market is going to be explosive from here , but it &apos;s at the right price based on underlying fundamentals , &quot; said Mike Frawley of Dean Witter . 
Most-active March settled 1.10 cents firmer at 101.75 cents per pound , traded 106.60 to 103.50 cents . 
spot December went out 0.20 cent higher at 105.25 cents . 
the run-up to options declaration had produced some choppiness which kept some out of the market , but the so-called Third Wednesday tightness in December LME was still a hurdle for copper to leap , traders said . 
the market was also waiting for Friday &apos;s LME stock report to see if the recent hikes in inventory were becoming a trend . 
some of the increase will come from COMEX stocks going into LME depots due to the London premium over New York , and from what surplus metal there is being lent to the market to make most of the firm LME backwardation , merchants and traders said .
