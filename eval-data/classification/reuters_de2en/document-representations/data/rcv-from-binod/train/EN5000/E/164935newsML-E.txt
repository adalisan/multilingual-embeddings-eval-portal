Eastern Europe &apos;s efforts to switch to a market economy have been impressive but some of its toughest problems lie ahead , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) said on Monday . 
&quot; The legacies of a command economy cannot be overcome in a few years ... there is progress across the board but hard problems remain , &quot; EBRD chief economist Nick Stern said . 
in its annual report of the region &apos;s transition since the Berlin Wall fell seven years ago , the bank focused on the need to raise domestic savings and improve an infrastructure set up with scant attention to either the consumer or the environment . 
&quot; Its ( infrastructure &apos;s ) commercialisation and restructuring are central to transition , &quot; Stern said . 
one of the major advances has been the success of the mass privatisation in countries of the former Soviet Union , Albania and Romania . 
countries with more sophisticated economies , such as the Czech Republic and Hungary , have begun to privatise their utilities and transport industries . 
the EBRD pointed out that $ 6 billion in foreign investment had flowed into the region &apos;s major infrastructure firms since 1990 , mainly into telecommunications and also into gas and electricity firms . 
&quot; However , some of the more difficult tasks at the heart of transition , such as enterprise restructuring , the rehabilitation and rebuilding of infrastructure , and the building of strong financial and legal institutions , have a long way to go , &quot; Stern said . 
higher living standards can only be sustained with increased domestic savings , the report said . 
but household savings have not increased enough to offet the substantial drop in the corporate and government sectors over the past few years . 
&quot; Policies that should help to reverse this trend include reducing government budget deficits to raise public savings and reforming social security systems and public pensions to boost private savings , &quot; the report said . 
it urged governments in the former East Bloc to increase the types of savings instruments and institutions , such as life insurance companies and private pension funds . 
these would help the development of local markets for long-term debt and equity .
