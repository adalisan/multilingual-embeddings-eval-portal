Israeli Finance Minister Dan Meridor will lead a business delegation to Jordan on Tuesday for talks on tourism and industrial projects , the Treasury said on Monday . 
Meridor planned to start the one-day visit on the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea , where Israeli and Jordanian businessmen will discuss projects such as establishment of a park at the lowest spot on earth , industrial zones , a fibre optic communications network and agricultural cooperation . 
the minister then travels to Amman for talks on bilateral economic issues with Crown Prince Hassan , Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti and Finance Minister Marwan Awad , the Treasury said in a statement . 
among the Israeli executives scheduled to make the trip are Emanuel Sharon , chairman of Bank Hapoalim , Michael Federman , chairman of the Dan Hotels Corporation and Shmuel Danker , chairman of the Danker Group . 
Israel and Jordan signed a peace treaty in 1994 , ending a 46-year state of war . 
but many Jordanians are cool to forging close ties with Israel and its first trade fair in Amman last week touched off protests by anti-Israeli demonstrators .
