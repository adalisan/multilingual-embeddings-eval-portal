an election victory for the French opposition left in a May 25 / June 1 election would leave the French franc nearly three centimes weaker against the mark by June 15 , according to a Reuters poll of economists on Wednesday . 
the median forecast for the franc against the mark in the event of a win for the left was 3.41 compared with 3.3730 on Wednesday . 
a win for the ruling coalition would send the franc to 3.3630 , close to this year &apos;s high of 3.3615 . 
French 10-year bonds would also suffer , with yields expected to climb to 20 basis points above 10-year Bund yields by June 15 compared with eight basis points below on Wednesday . 
the two-year spread would snap out to 40 from 17 on Wednesday if the left won , the poll showed . 
French and German 10-year bond yields , however , were expected to be the same by October 15 even in the event of a win for the left , according to the poll . 
following is a table of the forecasts for the franc , three-month interest rate futures ( PIBOR ) , the 10-year yield spread and the two-year yield spread in the event of a win for the right or the left :
