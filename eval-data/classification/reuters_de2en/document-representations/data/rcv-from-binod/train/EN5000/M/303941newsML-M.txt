Swedish debt yields fell sharply at the opening on Monday in the wake of lower yields overseas and remained lower through the day . 
by the close the nine year bond yield was nine basis points lower at 6.67 percent . 
&quot; But we have spread apart somewhat from Germany on long yields , &quot; one dealer said . 
the German-Swedish gap increased by three basis points to 84 . 
six month T-bill rates dropped four basis points to 3.69 percent . 
Sweden &apos;s central bank , the Riksbank , will announce its weekly repo operation 0830 GMT on Tuesday but most dealers were not expecting any change in the repo rate from 4.10 percent . 
&quot; I think the Riksbank wants to see more statistics before lowering . 
it will want to see the CPI figures that are due on January 21 , &quot; one dealer said . 
the crown ended at 4.3560 to the mark , which was stronger 4.3570 in late trade Friday but lower than afternoon levels . 
&quot; We saw some Swedish industrial companies buying currency for crowns . 
but I think the crown will keep its strength , &quot; one dealer said .
