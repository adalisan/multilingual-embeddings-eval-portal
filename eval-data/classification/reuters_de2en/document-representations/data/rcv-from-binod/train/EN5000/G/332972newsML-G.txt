thousands of bees disrupted a female circumcision ceremony in Sierra Leone , putting half the 100 girls taking part in hospital , one of the girls said . 
hospital sources said that most of the girls stung by bees during the ceremony in the northern region capital of Makeni on Wednesday had been discharged after receiving treatment . 
the bees prevented some of Wednesday &apos;s planned circumcisions taking place but some girls who had been mutilated were also being treated for serious bleeding and fever , they added . 
&quot; Bees in their thousands attacked the girls and the leaders of the traditional practice , &quot; Kadiatu Conteh told Reuters . 
&quot; The bees attacked us again and again leaving our half naked bodies battered and our faces and eyes swollen . 
Sierra Leone has one of the highest rates of female circumcision in Africa -- up to 90 percent of all its women . 
the practice , which consists of slicing off a girl &apos;s labia and clitoris , has been widely condemned on health grounds .
