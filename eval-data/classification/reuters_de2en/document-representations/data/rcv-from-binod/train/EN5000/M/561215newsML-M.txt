Bargain-hunting in several blue chip issues lifted Manila &apos;s main stock market index in late trade by 86.03 points , or 3.30 percent to 2,691.68 , traders said . 
&quot; This is a technical rally after the prolonged losses . 
most of the stocks are quite oversold and people just came back to buy shares , &quot; said Henry Ong , dealer at Sapphire Securities . 
&quot; I think part of the improved sentiment is due to the successful listing of premiere , &quot; said Ong . 
movie firm premiere entertainment productions Inc made its debut at 1.10 pesos over its one peso IPO price . 
the issue hit a high of 1.24 pesos in late trade . 
&quot; We have to wait and see before we can say that this is not just a technical rebound . 
Frontliners that shored the main index up late in the session were Ayala Corp B , Meralco B , Ayala Land Inc and Metrobank . 
even secondliner Megaworld properties &amp; Holdings Inc and its housing arm Empire East Land Holdings Inc , which were badly hurt by fears of an oversupply in the property sector , posted gains .
