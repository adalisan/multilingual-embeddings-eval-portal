Belgium said on Sunday that the 550 paratroopers it plans to send to its former colony Zaire will go there solely to evacuate its nationals and that it has no intentions of political meddling in Zaire &apos;s affairs . 
&quot; Our ambition is to help our citizens who want to leave the country . 
this has no political bearing whatsoever , particularly with regard to the current regime there , &quot; Defence Minister Jean-Paul Poncelet told Belgian radio RTBF on Sunday . 
France and the United States are also sending troops for a possible evacuation of their nationals from the war-torn central African country . 
a first group of 30 Belgian reconnaissance and liason officers is flying to Brazzaville , the capital of neighbouring Congo across the Zaire river , on Sunday evening . 
the rest of the 550 soldiers who are part of the &quot; Green Stream &quot; operation will follow on Monday , an army spokesman told a news conference on Sunday . 
Belgian media estimate the number of Westerners in the Zairean capital at about 7,000 , including fewer than 3,000 Belgians , about 1,000 French and 650 Americans . 
Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said he was annoyed by the fact that the Belgians in Zaire seemed so reluctant to leave the country , despite repeated calls to do so by the foreign ministry . 
&quot; We have been saying for weeks that they have to leave . 
now we have no other choice than to set up an evacuation mission again , at the taxpayer &apos;s expense , &quot; he told RTBF radio . 
Zaire is in deep crisis . 
long-time ruler President Mobutu Sese Seko , 66 , is gravely ill with cancer and rebels led by Laurent Kabila have seized about a fifth of the country . 
Derycke too stressed that Belgium had no intention of intervening in Zaire &apos;s political affairs , but in the same breath made an opening to Kabila . 
&quot; After 35 years of Mobutu , their country is destroyed , they have had enough of him . 
Zaireans want change , and change is called Kabila now , &quot; he said . 
Kabila , in an interview with Belgian television broadcast on Saturday , said that Belgium so far had not sent representatives to him for talks .
