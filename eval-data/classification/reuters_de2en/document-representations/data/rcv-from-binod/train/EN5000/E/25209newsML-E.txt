primary spending by the Belgian federal state was stable at 681.5 billion francs in the first seven months of 1996 , compared to 680.3 billion francs in the year-earlier period , the budget ministry said on Friday . 
corrected for inflation , spending fell 1.7 percent in real terms . 
the ministry said in a statement that the two main explanations for this result were a temporary acceleration in payments for hospital stays and subsidies in the social security sector . 
the ministry also said that the net balance of Treasury operations , targeted to fall 30.9 billion this year , was already 43.2 billion francs lower in the first seven months . 
by October it should fall to 56.6 billion , the ministry added .
