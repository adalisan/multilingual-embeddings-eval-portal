Italy &apos;s centre-left government has warned Northern League leader Umberto Bossi , who plans to declare &quot; independence &quot; for the country &apos;s rich north at the weekend , that the law must be respected . 
Prime Minister Romano Prodi , in an interview with RAI television on Wednesday night , said his government would be keeping a close eye on the fiery party leader and intended to be &quot; extremely firm and inflexible &quot; if he broke the law . 
Bossi , whose party has moved from federalism to outright secession , intends to proclaim a northern &quot; federal republic of Padania &quot; in Venice on Sunday as the climax to three days of demonstrations along the River Po . 
the League -- which built its support in northern Italy on discontent with corruption , central government inefficiency and high taxes -- also intends to set up a provisional government and declare a bill of rights . 
&quot; We have to be clear about Bossi , &quot; said Prodi , who comes from the wealthy central city of Bologna which would be included in Bossi &apos;s new republic . 
&quot; If Sunday &apos;s demonstration is a political demonstration along the river , then fine , &quot; said Prodi . 
&quot; This is within the laws of the land and we will be happy to witness the show from a distance . 
&quot; But if it means something outside the law or a secession , the government will be extremely rigid and inflexible because national unity is precious to everybody , &quot; Prodi warned . 
&quot; We will not tolerate wandering from the path of the law . 
the sovereignty of the law is our path . 
Italy &apos;s postwar constitution refers to the nation as &quot; one and indivisible &quot; and it is an offence to &quot; threaten the integrity , independence or unity of the state . 
however the government has resisted calls from some politicians to ban Bossi &apos;s &quot; independence &quot; rallies on the grounds that such a move would play into his hands . 
Bossi told RAI1 in a separate interview that the north would become truly independent on September 15 next year . 
&quot; One year later , on exactly the same date , independence will become operational , or rather the federal republic of Padania will become operational at all levels , &quot; he said . 
brushing aside assertions that those who wanted independence were a minority , Bossi said they were a majority in the north and promised a big turnout on Sunday . 
&quot; Sunday is a small test , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We will bring several million &quot; Padanians &quot; out along the Po . 
Prodi , professing to be &quot; concerned but calm &quot; ahead of a weekend sure to dominate the headlines , said Bossi and his supporters were welcome to demonstrate along the Po . 
Prodi , joining a growing chorus of establishment voices against Bossi , said Italy was a great country that could not be allowed to go the way of Czechoslovakia or Yugoslavia . 
&quot; Germany , which has become more united , is our example rather than countries which have divided and brought suffering to all their citizens , &quot; said Prodi . 
Italian president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro , speaking on an official visit to Switzerland , said earlier that the neighbouring Alpine nation &apos;s cantonal system was a model of political autonomy that Italy could learn from .
