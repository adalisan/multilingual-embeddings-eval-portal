district of Columbia is on track to close an $ 85.4 million shortfall this fiscal year , but declining revenues continue to plague the financially struggling city , D.C. &apos; s chief financial officer said . 
&quot; The city is on its way to closing an $ 85.4 million operating deficit , &quot; Anthony Williams told the city &apos;s five-member financial control board headed by economist Andrew Brimmer . 
&quot; ( But ) ... revenue growth in the District remains virtually flat , and with inflation factored in , revenues are declining , &quot; Williams told the board at a hearing on the city &apos;s financial progress in the first-quarter of 1997 and on estimated FY 1998 revenue collection in the city . 
Williams said the long-term forecast for general sales and use taxes for the city is increasing , but is &quot; still negative in real terms . 
he added , however , that the outlook for individual income taxes is &quot; somewhat brighter &quot; because federal government downsizing is finally slowing . 
he forecast that average economic growth over the next 10 years will be about two percent lower than the national average . 
on a bright note , he said federal employment in D.C. will stabilize after 2001 at approximately 200,000 employees . 
he added , &quot; Our population will decline to 522,000 persons by the year 2001 , then rise slowly , based on census Bureau projections . 
the Bureau announced recently that the city &apos;s population continues to plunge . 
the District lost 11,000 people in the last 12 months , from 554,000 to 543,000 , the Bureau said . 
Williams said the city &quot; welcomes &quot; three separate sets of recommendations for digging the District out of financial crisis that were made recently by the Clinton Administration , The Brookings Institution , and the Greater Washington Research Center . 
he said the city is committed to working with the control board in evaluating each set of proposals &quot; thoroughly .
