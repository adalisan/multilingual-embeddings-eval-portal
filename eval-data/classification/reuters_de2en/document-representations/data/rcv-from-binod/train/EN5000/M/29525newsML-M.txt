the Philippine peso ended higher at 26.254 to the dollar on Tuesday from the previous 26.265 as banks sold the U.S. currency following a rise in Central Bank overnight rates , traders said . 
&quot; The Central Bank used its overnight borrowing rate as a tool to curb speculation in the foreign exchange market , &quot; said one dealer . 
the peso peaked at 26.224 . 
traders said the Central Bank sold $ 27 million at 26.26 out of the $ 151 million that changed hands . 
the Central Bank surprised banks at the start of the trading when it raised its borrowing rate , dealers said .
