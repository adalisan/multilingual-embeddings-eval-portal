ousted Cambodian co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh flew into the Philippines on Sunday to hold talks with President Fidel Ramos on the fifth leg of an Asian tour to win diplomatic support . 
&quot; I &apos;ll see you after my meeting with the president , &quot; the prince told reporters on arrival from Bangkok . 
he received a low-key welcome at Manila airport from a Philippine official party led by foreign office chief of protocol , Ambassador Victor Garcia . 
foreign Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino , who is to meet Ranariddh later on Sunday , declined to say what specific subjects he or Ramos would discuss with the prince . 
&quot; He ( Ramos ) will listen to him ... The president obviously has some ideas , &quot; he said . 
Ranariddh &apos;s stop in the Philippines was his fifth on a tour of member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) . 
asked how ASEAN countries which Ranariddh has visited -- Indonesia , Thailand , Singapore and Malaysia -- reacted to the prince &apos;s campaign for support , Severino said : &quot; They listened to him . 
ASEAN was to have accepted Cambodia as a member last month but the group postponed its entry after Second Prime Minister Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh in a coup . 
troops loyal to Hun Sen have been closing in on the last major position held by royalist forces in the country . 
ASEAN comprises Indonesia , the Philippines , Malaysia , Singapore , Thailand , Brunei , Vietnam and new members Laos and Burma . 
Ranariddh may leave Manila on Monday night , officials said .
