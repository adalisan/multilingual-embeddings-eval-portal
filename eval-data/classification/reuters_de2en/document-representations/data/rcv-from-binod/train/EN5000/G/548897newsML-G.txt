Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh has postponed a planned trip to Burma this weekend because the timing did not suit Rangoon , a senior Thai government source said on Tuesday . 
Chavalit , who has close links with Burma &apos;s ruling generals , said last week he planned to visit Rangoon on May 3 and 4 to strengthen relations . 
&quot; The Burmese counterparts informed our liaison officials that the proposed dates were not convenient , &quot; a senior government source said . 
no new dates have been proposed . 
the source declined to say if the postponement was linked to economic sanctions imposed on Burma last week by the United States . 
Washington announced a ban on all new American investment in the country citing human rights abuses and repression of the opposition . 
the United States is also lobbying members of the seven-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) to drop its plan to accept Burma as a full member later this year . 
officials in Thailand , an ASEAN member , have said the sanctions will not affect Burma &apos;s entry .
