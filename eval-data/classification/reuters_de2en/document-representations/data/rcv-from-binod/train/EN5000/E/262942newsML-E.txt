Saudi Arabia is studying measures to boost its industry and raise its 13 percent contribution to gross domestic product ( GDP ) to help diversify from oil and increase private sector participation , King Fahd said . 
he said the new measures would include &quot; drawing on the successful experiments by other countries which achieved industrial progress within a record time to help Saudi planners lay clear and practical plans ... by which the contribution of the industrial sector grows beyond the current 13 percent of GDP . 
the official Saudi Press Agency said the king was addressing the weekly cabinet meeting late on Monday . 
he did not elaborate on the other measures . 
Saudi Arabia said this month it was reviewing its foreign capital law to introduce more incentives to international investors in a country where most foreign capital is invested in joint ventures with Saudi firms . 
foreign capital can be invested without Saudi participation , but then it does not qualify for a range of incentives , including tax holidays . 
King Fahd stressed the importance of the industrial sector in speeding up efforts to &quot; diversify production , lessen dependence on ... oil , increase the contribution of the private sector ... enhance the skills of Saudi labour and establish a solid technological base . 
Saudi Arabia is the world &apos;s largest oil producer and exporter , but oil prices which strengthened this year after several years of weakness have prompted it to draw up plans to diversify the economy and urge a bigger private sector role . 
King Fahd said by the end of May 1996 the investments of 2,476 licensed factories totalled 163 billion riyals ( $ 43.4 billion ) and welcomed progress made by Saudi industrial companies in replacing expatriate labour with Saudi manpower . 
he said Saudi workers made up 65 percent of the employees of the industrial and petrochemical giant Saudi Basic Industries Corp SABIC . 
the king has repeatedly urged the private sector to employ more nationals and said the government would ensure that 650,000 Saudis had private sector jobs by the year 2000 . 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s annual population growth is estimated at up to four percent . 
petrochemicals form the cornerstone of the kingdom &apos;s industry , followed by oil refining and other manufacturing , the kingdom &apos;s 1995-2000 development plan says . 
it says the average annual growth of its industrial sector between 1990 and 1995 was 4.3 percent while the sector &apos;s contribution to GDP by the end of 1995 was 13.1 percent , of which petrochemicals accounted for 10 percent .
