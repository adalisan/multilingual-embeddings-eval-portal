world oil prices fell on Thursday as downward pressure from $ 2.14 billion of looming Iraqi oil exports more than offset strong underlying demand . 
Iraq is preparing to resume oil exports under an oil-for-food exchange with the United Nations but traders said underlying demand for oil was strong and any price weakness may prove temporary . 
oil companies were jostling for position to rent tankers after Wednesday &apos;s news that United Nations oil experts or overseers had approved Iraq &apos;s pricing formula for its oil . 
the U.N. sanctions committee , which has until 1500 GMT on Friday to raise any objections to the pricing formula , is the final obstacle before the sale goes ahead . 
traders said they expected the Iraqi oil to hit the market soon . 
but Iraq appeared to be adding a political twist to the oil sales on Thursday after Baghdad turned down requests from British Petroleum and Shell to buy oil while French company Elf said it expected to renew its contract from the previous oil-for-food deal . 
on Wednesday Iraq &apos;s Oil Minister Amir Muhammed Rasheed said they would give &quot; priority &quot; to companies and states that adopted a &quot; positive &quot; stance towards Iraq . 
the benchmark London September North Sea Brent blend futures contract closed 35 cents down at $ 18.85 a barrel while in New York , the West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) September crude contract ended the day 36 cents down at $ 20.10 a barrel . 
despite downward pressure from the imminent flood of Iraqi oil some dealers expected only a modest and short-lived drop in oil prices . 
they said demand to restock ahead of the winter was likely to boost demand over the next few months and the delay in Iraq resuming oil exports had crimped the normal summer stockbuild . 
sales under the second phase of Iraq &apos;s oil-for-food exchange with the U.N. were delayed since early June by negotiations over an aid distribution plan . 
but Iraq is now expected to move full steam ahead in an effort to meet its permitted $ 2.14 billion worth of sales , including $ 140 million for Turkish pipeline fees , in two equal 90-day instalments . 
it will have less than a month to reach an initial billion dollar target by September 5 which implies a flood of early cargoes , but after that traders said exports would reigned back to a level which could be easily absorbed by the market . 
&quot; I see the chance of one last down move when gasoline falls followed by a quick move back up , &quot; said one trader . 
gasoline prices have rallied recently in the West but with the summer driving season all but over demand is on the wane .
