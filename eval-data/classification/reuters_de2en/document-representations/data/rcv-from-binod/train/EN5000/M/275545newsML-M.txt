Asian crudes were lower in outright terms on Tuesday but premiums of ADNOC grades firmed on end-of-month demand from a U.S. major . 
traders said some majors stepped up their buying in February after keeping purchases to a minimum in recent months on the expectation that Iraq &apos;s return to the market would subdue prices . 
but just-in-time stock management by refiners worldwide and an earlier-than-expected winter in the northern hemisphere has underpinned crude prices forcing many players to buy . 
the residual demand prompted firmer end-of-month premiums . 
premiums for the three crudes had traded mostly in the 70s , with the exception of Murban which had traded just above ADNOC plus 80 cents last week into an African tender . 
traders said demand for February MidEast barrels had now dwindled . 
however , one major was heard holding a cargo of February Lower Zakum and a partial of Murban . 
Paper levels were steady and SIMEX Brent futures did not trade . 
February Brent was quoted a steady $ 23.20 / $ 23.30 versus the London settlement overnight of $ 23.19 . 
the firmer Brent / Dubai quotes after Dubai &apos;s 20-cent fall on Monday sparked some trades of the arbitrage . 
a European major sold February at $ 1.95 per barrel to a Wall Street trader and separate European major sold at $ 1.96 to another Wall Street trader .
