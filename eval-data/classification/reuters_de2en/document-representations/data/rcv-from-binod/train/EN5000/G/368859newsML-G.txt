on the day the Hollywood made public its Academy Award nominations , Hungary &apos;s version of the Oscars , announced on Tuesday , went mostly to films drawing on the country &apos;s communist past . 
the 28th Hungarian film week , a five-day showcase for the country &apos;s remarkable annual cinema output of 25 feature films , 40 documentaries and 20 experimental films , ended on Tuesday . 
two directors relatively unknown outside Hungary , Peter Timar , 46 , and Attila Janisch , 39 , shared the Grand Prize for best feature film , to be presented on Tuesday night . 
Timar &apos;s musical comedy &quot; Dollybirds &quot; drew on a rich vein of sixties communist nostalgia and contrasted sharply with Janisc &apos;s &quot; The Long dusk &quot; , a surreal mix of dream and reality based on Shirley Jackson &apos;s short story &quot; The Bus &quot; , and featuring Hungary &apos;s grand old lady of film , Maria Torocsik . 
&quot; Dollybirds &quot; recounts the attempts by residents of a Budapest apartment block to win entry to an international talent contest in Helsinki in 1962 as a way of getting out of the country and features a cast of colourful characters singing to a soundtrack of sixties Hungarian hits . 
the best actress award was also tied , between Eva Kerekes , for her role in &quot; Every Sunday &quot; as a prison guard in a female camp in post-war Stalinist Hungary , and Kati Lazar , who played a girl raped by Soviet soldiers then sent to a Siberian work camp . 
no prize was awarded for Best actor . 
the festival was organised in three downtown Budapest cinemas , with the main venue the newly restored Corvin Cinema , scene of some of the bitterest fighting in the country &apos;s uprising against Stalinist rule in 1956 .
