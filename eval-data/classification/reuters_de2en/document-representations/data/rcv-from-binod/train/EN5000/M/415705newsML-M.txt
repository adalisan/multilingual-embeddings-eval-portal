Turkish shares slipped back in cautious trade on Monday after a warning by the army against ruling Islamists sowed fresh market uncertainty about the political situation , analysts and brokers said . 
the IMKB National-100 fell 30 points , or 1.86 percent to 1,583 , in early afternoon trading . 
trading volume in the morning session stood at 9.54 trillion lira ( $ 77.6 million ) compared with 5.54 trillion in Friday &apos;s morning session . 
Turkey &apos;s generals warned the Islamist-led government of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan at Friday &apos;s National Security Council ( MGK ) meeting that they wanted a crackdown on what they saw as a wave of religious zeal threatening secular democracy . 
these are good opportunities for selling , I expect declines , &quot; said Mustafa Karaahmetoglu of Sayilgan Securities . 
market participants said assessing the full impact of the meeting was difficult as attention was also focused on Tuesday &apos;s release of February inflation data . 
broker Mustafa Yilmaz said market insecurity was reflected in rising volume in the overnight repo market . 
&quot; An easing in political tension is needed . 
newspapers full of pictures of army generals negatively affect the market , &quot; he said . 
one dealer forecast the main stock market index could decline to support at 1,500 during the day as a whole . 
Istanbul shares have rallied strongly since the start of the year on hopes for privatisation , jumping 65 percent in lira terms in the last two months . 
official forecasts of $ 5 billion privatisation revenues and a court go-ahead for the sale of the state telecommunications company Turk Telekom have helped fuel market optimism . 
however , anxieties in financial circles about Erbakan &apos;s ultimate political aims have been stoked by the military warning and bankers were waiting to see how the Islamist leader would react to it . 
&quot; If Erbakan goes on with his old radical declarations it is a danger and the military will escalate the problem , &quot; said Oner Ayan , responsible for international capital markets at ATA Securities . 
he said the main pressure on Erbakan was likely to come from parliament rather than the military and this would pressure him to backtrack . 
&quot; This will increase stability , remove irritants for foreign investors ... and attract more foreign capital investment , &quot; Ayan said . 
he forecast the current political uncertainty , exacerbated by the media , would fade in the coming weeks but the government would remain burdened with long-term challenges of reforming taxation and the social security system . 
despite bold revenue-raising forecasts , the drafting of a balanced budget for 1997 and declining interest rates , the government is still struggling to find a solution to annual inflation running at 85 percent . 
the latest price data for February was due out on Tuesday and is expected to show continued strong inflation . 
analysts forecast a 4.5-5.5 percent month-on-month rise in consumer prices . 
bond yields were little changed in quiet trade as volume fell ahead of the inflation announcement . 
the most heavily traded December 10 paper yielded 96.08 percent , compared to Friday &apos;s average of 96.24 percent . 
the lira eased to 122,900 against the dollar from Friday &apos;s close of 122,410 . 
( $ 1 = 122,900 Turkish lira )
