Austria &apos;s Social Democrats and conservative People &apos;s Party are running neck and neck ahead of European parliamentary elections on Sunday but almost half the electorate is still undecided , a survey said on Thursday . 
the poll , conducted by the Gallup Institute for the weekly current affairs magazine News , showed backing for the Social Democrats at 31 percent -- one of its lowest levels since 1945 and down from 38 percent in December &apos;s general election . 
junior coalition party the People &apos;s Party gained 31 percent support , up from 28 percent in December . 
news magazine traced the rise in the conservative party &apos;s popularity to the personal appeal of its leading EU candidate Ursula Stenzel , an Austrian television personality . 
Joerg Haider &apos;s far-right Freedom Party came in third with 24 percent of the vote , while the Greens and Liberals won eight and six percent backing respectively . 
around 46 percent of voters said they had yet to decide how they would cast their ballot . 
Gallup noted a protest vote against the ruling coalition could significantly boost support for the Freedom Party . 
&quot; two-thirds of the undecided voters say they are considering delivering a warning to the government , &quot; News said . 
that could cut support for the Social Democrats to 29 percent , a post-World War Two low , and leave the Freedom Party and People &apos;s Party fighting for second place with around 27 percent backing each , according to Gallup . 
some 5.8 million citizens are eligible to vote in the October 13 election , the first European parliament vote since Austria joined the EU in January last year .
