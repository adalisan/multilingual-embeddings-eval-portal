Argentine stocks slipped for the third session running Thursday and traders took little comfort from the fact losses were tame compared to the rout seen on Wall Street . 
&quot; All considering , the Bolsa performed quite well . 
but if the U.S. markets keep buckling under interest rate pressures the medium-term trend could turn negative , &quot; said Emilio Alessandro at brokers Alessandro . 
the blue-chip MerVal index recovered from a session floor of 701 to close off 1.3 percent at 708.78 . 
it stands 4.5 percent lower since Monday &apos;s close . 
&quot; The market steadied at the psychological level of 700 , but I don &apos;t think it will offer any real support , &quot; said Alessandro . 
&quot; The international scenario is too grim right now . 
traders said the markets were anxiously waiting for Friday &apos;s U.S. producer price index , which could help soothe nerves rattled by strong retail sales data Thursday . 
the data stoked fears of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike March 25 and sent the Dow reeling 2.3 percent to its fifth-worst-ever loss of 160 points . 
the long bond yield jumped to 6.96 percent from 6.88 percent Wednesday . 
on the Bolsa floor volume shrank to 26 million pesos from 32.6 million Wednesday , while over-the-counter deals eased to 127.9 million from 143.8 million Wednesday . 
the broad market index fell 1.6 percent , with losers thrashing winners 41 to seven and 13 issues closing flat . 
heaviest main-tier losers were steelmakers Siderca and Siderar , down 3.2 percent and 3.1 percent . 
the only MerVal gainers were textile firm Alpargatas , pulp maker Celulosa and holding Perez Companc , up 2.9 percent , 1.4 percent and 0.3 percent respectively .
