Portuguese bonds closed at their day &apos;s highs but failed to rise as strongly as their Spanish and Italian equivalents and dealers said profit-taking and concern over U.S. hourly earnings data had put a lid on gains . 
&quot; The mood is much more positive . 
liquidity has increased and we finished at around the day &apos;s highs , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; But although U.S. non-farm payrolls were benign , hourly earnings have raised worries about a rise in U.S. 
rates . 
other traders said shorter maturities were still enjoying support from a belief that the Bank of Portugal will cut its key rates soon , possibly next week .
