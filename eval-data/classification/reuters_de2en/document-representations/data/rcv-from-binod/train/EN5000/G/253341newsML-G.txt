the French government will accept a Senate committee amendment to a draft private pension funds law and limit the level of relief first envisaged for employers on payroll contributions to the Social Security regime , Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said on Thursday . 
&quot; To allay fears , the government will agree to the amendment from the ( Senate ) social affairs committee , which cancels the special relief clause on social charges , &quot; Arthuis said . 
the Senate social affairs committee has proposed amending a clause that would make employers &apos; contributions deductible from payroll Social Security charges to about 4,000 French francs ( $ 766.3 ) a year plus two percent of an employee &apos;s salary . 
Arthuis told the Senate , which is examining the bill passed recently by the National Assembly , or lower house of parliament , that the treatment of employer contributions to private pension funds would be the same as under the existing state-backed retirement regime . 
&quot; This regime allows for relief on contributions capped at 85 percent of the annual Social Security ceiling , that is up to 137,037 francs of contributions , &quot; he said , according to a text of his address the the parliament &apos;s upper house . 
a Senate vote is due on Friday on the bill which will allow the introduction of private pension funds in France , probably in 1998 . 
trade unions had objected to the special relief regime for employers , saying it could undermine the existing state-backed retirements regime that the government promises will not be hurt by the introduction of private regimes .
