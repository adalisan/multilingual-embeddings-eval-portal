President Ange-Felix Patasse of the Central African Republic assured President Laurent Kabila in an interview broadcast on Tuesday that his country would not be used as a launching pad for attacks against the former Zaire . 
Patasse told state television in former Zaire , renamed Democratic Republic of the Congo by Kabila , that Zaireans who had crossed into the Central African Republic during Kabila &apos;s seven-month military rebellion were returning home . 
he said ex-government soldiers among them had been disarmed and told Kabila would not harm them if they returned home . 
&quot; The Central African Republic is a very hospitable country . 
we don &apos;t want our country to be used as a launching point for attacks against a friendly country , &quot; Patasse , once perceived as an ally of former Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese Seko , said in the interview . 
Kinshasa opposition leader Joseph Olenghankoy said on Monday that the former Zaire was under threat of a military attack from Mobutu &apos;s sons and other senior figures of the old regime . 
he said the attack could be launched against the province of Equateur , which borders the Central African Republic to the north . 
Patasse , who went to Kinshasa on Sunday for a regional summit of heads of states and governments , left on Monday .
