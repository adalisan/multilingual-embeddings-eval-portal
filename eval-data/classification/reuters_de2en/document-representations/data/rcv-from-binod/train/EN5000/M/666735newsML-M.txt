Tokyo stocks are likely to drift in Wednesday &apos;s session as investors back off ahead of the G7 summit , brokers said . 
they added that the release of May customs-cleared trade statistics shortly before the session starts could move currencies , which would influence stock trading , especially if the yen were to strengthen excessively against the dollar . 
on Tuesday , the Nikkei 225 ended 87.41 points or 0.42 percent down at 20,593.66 . 
its September futures shed 220 to finish at 20,600 . 
&quot; The data will probably show Japan &apos;s trade surplus growing against the U.S. , &quot; said Kunihiro Hatae , Tokyo Securities general manager . 
&quot; The market is worried that discussions may heat up over the surplus at the Group of Seven ( G7 ) ( industrialised nations &apos; ) summit meeting in Denver later this week . 
economists polled by Reuters forecast , on average , that Japan &apos;s trade surplus , scheduled to be released at 8.50 a.m. , would rise to 548.5 billion yen , from a surplus of 229 billion yen a year earlier . 
their forecasts ranged from a surplus of 400 billion to 760 billion yen . 
&quot; As long as the yen does not shoot to levels near 105 yen to the dollar and linger there , forcing exporters to revise their earnings , there should be no change in the current trend , &quot; said Mikio Takada , Nikko Securities general manager . 
&quot; The downside of the Nikkei average should inch higher , supported by bargain-hunting , &quot; he added . 
the downside for the Nikkei average was seen to be very firm at around 20,000 while the upper-limit was seen near 20,700 . 
turnover was a light 160 million shares against 205 million on the previous day . 
losers beat winners 613 to 383 while 230 issues remained unchanged . 
Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd was the most heavily traded issue on the first section of the Tokyo bourse at 4.99 million shares . 
it fell seven yen to 163 on profit-taking . 
&quot; The shares were bought on Tuesday on news that it was going to form a cooperative arrangement with Barclays Bank , but few investors believe that the news is enough to keep buying the shares , &quot; said a broker at a medium-sized brokerage . 
shares of Sumitomo Bank fell , still depressed by news that two employees at its California unit had filed an appeal with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp claiming the unit &apos;s loan policies ran afoul of U.S. regulations . 
it slipped 20 yen to stand at 1,750 yen . 
turnover was 3.58 million shares , making it the second most heavily traded issue . 
in addition to pressure coming from the stronger yen , news that Honda Motor Co Ltd was considering lowering its production plans for July also pushed down the share price . 
Honda fell 90 yen to stand at 3,310 . 
by sector , credit / lease , mining , ceramics , air transport and retailers were at the top of the list of gaining sectors . 
rubber , sea transport , precision instruments , automobile and real estate headed the list of declining sectors .
