U.S. Gulf Coast and Midcontinent regular gasoline differentials eased modestly Tuesday , though outright prices jumped higher tracking the jump in NYMEX values . 
however , premium gasoline differentials appeared to firm due to slim availability of prompt barrels , traders said . 
on the NYMEX , August gasoline gained 1.59 cents to settle at 59.94 cents a gallon and August heating oil firmed 1.28 cent to end at 52.95 cents a gallon . 
the American Petroleum Institute report , released Tuesday evening , showed gasoline stocks fell 3.5 million barrels , helped by a drop in imports and strong implied demand , while distillate stocks jumped 5.5 million barrels . 
prompt regular conventional M1 gasoline differentials slipped off their highs from earlier in the day , with offers late in the day at about 0.50 cent under the August futures . 
that differential had climbed to about 0.25 cent over the August NYMEX , though reluctant buyers forced sellers to follow them lower . 
&quot; It &apos;s been kind of squirrely lately , &quot; one Gulf Coast trader said , referring to the high volatility in conventional gasolines . 
&quot; You don &apos;t do anything unless you have to , &quot; the trader added . 
prompt reformulated A1 gasoline slipped to about 3.25 to 3.50 cents over the screen , down about 1.00 cent on the day as buyers vanished . 
however , 93-octane premium conventional gasoline remained in demand , with prompt barrels talked between 6.00 and 6.25 cents over the conventional M1 . 
premium gasoline grades leapt higher Tuesday as tightness in prompt barrels forced buyers to chase prices up , according to market watchers . 
prompt 93-octane reformulated D2 gasoline traded at 9.25 cents over the August futures earlier in the day , a full 0.50 cent over late Monday levels , traders said . 
prompt 93-octane conventional V2 gasoline was talked at above 7.00 cents over the August NYMEX , a gain of about one cent on the day . 
regular conventional M2 gasoline showed little change by late day , with traders putting prompt barrels near 2.50 cents under the August futures , though some barrels on the Buckeye pipeline were heard done at about 2.00 cents under the NYMEX . 
prompt gasoline differentials in the Group Three markets dipped amid expectations for ample supply for the next several days . 
&quot; Supply ahead looks like basis will be weakening , &quot; said a gasoline trader , noting more shipments are heading to the hub at a time when supply is already at a stable 21-days . 
prompt Group Three weakened about a half cent from Monday to 2.15 / 2.30 cents over August futures . 
any months were also down at 1.50 / 1.75 cents over the print . 
Chicago markets were nearly 0.75 cent below Monday , in line with the drop in Group Three and weak demand . 
prompt Chicago gasoline differentials were pegged 1.75 / 2.00 cents over the print , with the any months at 1.50 / 1.75 cents .
