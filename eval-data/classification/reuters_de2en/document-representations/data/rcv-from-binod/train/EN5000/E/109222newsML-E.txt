U.S. cash registers appeared to stay ominously quiet for the fourth consecutive month in September , but the summer doldrums should give way to brisk sales come the fall , economists said on Wednesday . 
a slowdown in September department store sales coupled with a decline in the unit sales of domestically produced cars will have depressed the figures , analysts said . 
&quot; I expect a fairly weak report and more of a confirmation that since May , retail sales have been sluggish to declining , &quot; said Peter Kretzmer , economist at NationsBank Corp. 
a Reuter poll showed September &apos;s consensus forecast for retail sales matching August &apos;s gain of 0.2 percent . 
excluding autos , the poll showed a 0.3 percent gain was expected . 
analysts forsee a rise in sales from the furniture and appliances component of consumer durable goods , and from a rise in gasoline prices during the month . 
consumers view gasoline as a necessity and demand is often impervious to price fluctuations , they said . 
economists added the caveat that a drop in the unit sales of cars does not necessarily mean dollar volume of the vehicle component will also be lower . 
accounting practices for different seasonal factors were blamed for the inconsistency . 
this was evidenced in August when the auto component was flat even though unit sales surged , economists said . 
&quot; The unit sales did not track the value of sales in August as the seasonals are different and I suspect we &apos;re going to get some bounce in September from that , &quot; said Gary Schlossberg , senior economist at Wells Fargo and Co . 
after consumer demand stormed ahead the first half of this year , economists said it would struggle to surpass one percent annualized growth in the third quarter . 
the annualized growth rate at the end of the second quarter was a healthy 3.5 percent , well above the long-term trend of 2.0 percent , analysts said . 
however , some economists view September as a transition period , with rising incomes putting spare change in people &apos;s pockets come the fall . 
&quot; Consumer demand will pick up again . 
we are in the early stages of another rebound in consumer spending , &quot; said Michael Strauss , chief economist at Yamaichi International ( America ) Inc . 
&quot; We had a pause during the summer and think we will start to see a bounce over the next couple of weeks with fall merchandising products starting to sell a little bit better . 
rising wages , as evidenced last Friday after the release of a robust 0.5 percent rise in September hourly earnings , will not affect the September sales data but should spark buying come the end of the year , economists said . 
&quot; It will help retail sales into the Christmas season , but no so much for this number , &quot; Strauss said . 
general merchandise store sales fell 0.4 percent in September , according to the Redbook retail sales index . 
the sale of domestic light vehicles dropped substantially to 13.2 million cars on a seasonally adjusted annual rate , versus 14.0 in August , analysts said .
