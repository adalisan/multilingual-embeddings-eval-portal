Slovenian President Milan Kucan on Thursday opened the first session of the new parliament , elected on November 10 . 
&quot; We expect ( you ) will look for solutions to achieve prosperity in our country ... ( and ) work for a stable , secure and internationally acknowledged Slovenia , &quot; Kucan told the parliament . 
but two and a half weeks after Slovenia &apos;s second general election since independence from former Yugoslavia in 1991 , it is still unclear who will be asked to form the new government . 
the Liberal Democrats of Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek , 46 , are the strongest single party , with 25 of the chamber &apos;s 90 seats , but political analysts say Drnovsek could have a battle on his hands returning to power as premier . 
his party is up against the loose &quot; Spring &quot; alliance , comprising the conservative People &apos;s Party , centre-right Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats , who won 45 seats in all , missing an absolute majority by just one seat . 
the alliance is pushing for Marjan Podobnik , 35 , head of the People &apos;s Party , to become the next prime minister . 
the group has offered the Liberal Democrats a place in government if Drnovsek steps down as premier . 
but Drnovsek has said his party would only cooperate in a government where he was prime minister . 
Drnovsek had been scheduled to meet the heads of the &quot; Spring &quot; parties on Wednesday evening to start talks on a possible coalition , but the three parties called off the meeting 15 minutes before it was due to start . 
&quot; This simply means the parliament will have to start working without any agreement between the main parties , &quot; Drnovsek told Slovenian television . 
President Milan Kucan must name a candidate for prime minister within 30 days of Thursday &apos;s opening of parliament .
