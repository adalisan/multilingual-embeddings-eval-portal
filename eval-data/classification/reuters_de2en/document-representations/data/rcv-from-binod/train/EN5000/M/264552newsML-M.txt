the Italian Treasury is expected to announce a new 30-year fixed rate government bond ( BTP ) when it gives details on Thursday on long and medium term paper for auction at the end of the month , bond traders said . 
settlement for the November 1 , 1996 paper is expected to be at the start of January and will include interest on the two preceding months . 
the first tranche is expected to be between 1.5 and 2.0 trillion lire , dealers said , but they did not forecast the coupon . 
they said the November 1 date , similar to Italy &apos;s first 30-year bond issued in 1993 bearing a nine percent coupon , would promote the start of a coupon-stripping market . 
&quot; In 1997 , the Treasury will also want to move on the coupon stripping market , &quot; one said . 
Coupon-stripping means detaching coupons from a bond and trading the principal repayment and coupon amounts separately . 
Italy issued its first ever 30-year bond in November 1993 . 
this matures on November 1 , 2023 and was aimed at institutional investors like pension funds and insurers . 
the Treasury held a regular meeting with 13 specialist bond market traders on Wednesday and , on Thursday once the markets have closed , it will announce the type of medium and long term paper up for auction at the end of the month . 
traders expect the January 1 , 2006 BTP with a coupon of 7.75 percent will be reopened , but are unsure whether or not three and five year paper expected to be on offer will be tranches of previous bonds or new issues .
