the presidents of Ecuador and Peru , whose troops clashed last year over a border dispute , met here on Tuesday and said they were ready to be friends . 
Presidents Abdala Bucaram of Ecuador and Alberto Fujimori of Peru held a 30-minute meeting on the fringes of a summit of the Rio Group of 14 Latin American nations and Bucaram told a joint news conference afterwards : &quot; We have agreed that I will visit Peru in January to strengthen our friendship . 
Fujimori said : &quot; I think we will have a very fluid relationship . 
we even are on a first-name basis . 
Bucaram , who took office last month , vowed on Monday that under his administration there would be no repetition of the January 1995 border clashes in which about 100 men died . 
&quot; That is absolutely ruled out , &quot; he said . 
the two leaders declined to discuss the longstanding border dispute , saying the four peace guarantors -- the United States , Brazil , Argentina and Chile -- had requested a moratorium on declarations .
