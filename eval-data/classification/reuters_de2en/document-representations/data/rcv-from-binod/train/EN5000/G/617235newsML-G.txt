France &apos;s opposition Socialist party will pull out just one candidate from Sunday &apos;s parliamentary election runoff to block election of a far-right National Front member , party officials said on Tuesday . 
in all other districts , the party plans to maintain its candidates for the race in which the Socialist-led opposition has a chance of wresting power in the National Assembly from the ruling centre-right . 
Socialist candidate Birgitta Hessel would pull out of a three-way race in Dreux , west of Paris , the officials said . 
by standing down , she will bolster the chances of outgoing conservative deputy Gerard Hamel against Marie-France Stirbois of the Front , which wants to send home three million immigrants and openly espouses theories of racial inequality . 
under an informal pact , the mainstream left or right pull out candidates where the other has a better chance of defeating the Front , led by Jean-Marie Le Pen . 
the issue is more controversial this time around , when a stunning swing to the left on the first round two days ago has left the left scenting a return to power . 
the Front currently has no seats in parliament . 
the Socialists will be keeping on candidates in Orange and Mantes la Jolie , for instance , where the Socialist came third on the first round . 
the party insists they have a real chance of victory . 
outgoing Prime Minister Alain Juppe said earlier that the ruling coalition would maintain candidates in three-way runoff races against the Front wherever their candidate had a chance of victory . 
in cases where the National Front and a mainstream left candidate were contesting a seat in a two-way runoff , Juppe gave an indirect call to vote left , saying voters should examine underlying values of humanism and tolerance before voting .
