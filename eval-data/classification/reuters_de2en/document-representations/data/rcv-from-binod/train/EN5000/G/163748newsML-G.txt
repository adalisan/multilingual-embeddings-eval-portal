pop superstar Michael Jackson said on Monday that a longtime friend of his is pregnant with his child , declaring &quot; this is my dream come true . 
the woman , identified as Debbie Rowe , has been a close friend of the singer for 15 years and will have the baby in early 1997 , according to a statement from Jackson &apos;s publicists . 
publicists denied reports he had paid Rowe to carry his child and said rumours that she was artificially inseminated were &quot; completely false and irresponsible . 
&quot; But they declined to comment when asked about the couple &apos;s sexual relationship . 
&quot; I am thrilled that I will soon be a father and am looking forward with great anticipation to having this child , &quot; Jackson said in a written statement . 
a spokeswoman said that Jackson was not ready to talk about how the child would be raised but added , &quot; I &apos;m sure that Michael is going to be giving this child 100 percent support . 
earlier news reports identified Rowe as a 37-year-old nurse who had been paid $ 500,000 to have Jackson &apos;s child by artificial insemination . 
Lisa Marie Presley , daughter of the late rock &apos; n roll legend Elvis Presley , filed for divorce from Jackson in January , citing irreconcilable differences , about 20 months after they were married in a secret ceremony in the Dominican Republic . 
some Hollywood insiders had speculated that the marriage was little more that a publicity stunt to deflect media attention that had mushroomed around allegations that Jackson sexually molested a young boy . 
only months before the divorce filing , the couple , in a national television interview , said they married for love , and Presley said she and Jackson shared the same bed and had an active sex life . 
Jackson vehemently denied the boy &apos;s claims of sexual molestation , and prosecutors announced in late 1994 that they had decided not to file criminal charges after the boy refused to cooperate in the investigation . 
that came after Jackson agreed in January 1994 to pay the boy a multimillion-dollar settlement in return for dropping a civil lawsuit against the singer . 
in Monday &apos;s announcement Jackson pleaded with the media : &quot; Please respect my privacy and that of Debbie and the child ... this is my dream come true . 
Jackson has long been a favourite of the tabloid press and rumours of the pregnancy had already made front-page headlines . 
&quot; Michael regrets that the news of Debbie &apos;s pregnancy was accompanied by several false and distorted reports and speculations and urges the media to respect his and Debbie &apos;s privacy . 
this is a very exciting time for both Michael and Debbie , &quot; the statement said . 
this is but the latest twist in the career of a pop star who has appeared painfully shy and reclusive in his personal life but a consummate exhibitionist when on stage . 
Jackson , one of the top-selling recording artists of all time , is viewed as an oddity for his penchant for plastic surgery , and other eccentricities .
