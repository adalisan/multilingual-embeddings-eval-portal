Zaire rained more bombs on its rebel-held towns on Tuesday , putting thousands of panic-stricken residents to flight , officials and aid workers said . 
a defence ministry official in Kinshasa said government planes bombed the eastern towns of Bukavu , Shabunda and Walikale on Tuesday , continuing attacks from Monday . 
&quot; bombardments resumed this morning in all the three towns . 
we don &apos;t have any assessment yet but we know that all the targets were hit , &quot; the official told Reuters in the capital . 
&quot; There is a continuous flow of movement from Bukavu . 
it does not exceed perhaps 20 percent of the population but it is in the thousands , &quot; said Marcel van Soest of the charity , Medecins sans Frontieres ( MSF ) in the eastern rebel headquarters city of Goma . 
&quot; People in panic are fleeing in all directions , &quot; an aid worker in the Bukavu area said . 
aid workers keeping track of bodies pulled from rubble put the latest death toll at 21 , with 37 people wounded . 
the intensifying air war is the first tangible move in a faltering government counter-offensive to retake territory from rebels waging a four-month campaign in east Zaire . 
U.N. envoy Hohammed Sahnoun called for urgent steps to defuse violence and avert wider conflict in a volatile region . 
&quot; That implies the withdrawal of all foreign forces from east Zaire , including mercenaries , &quot; Sahnoun told a news conference after talks with Zaire officials . 
European mercenaries , notably Serbs , are helping Zaire &apos;s bedraggled army to retake the initiative in the war after a string of losses at the hands of highly motivated rebels . 
Zaire &apos;s ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko hired mercenaries and acquired Russian-made fighter jets and helicopter gunships after accusing the armies of Rwanda , Uganda and Burundi of joining the rebels . 
all three neighbours deny this . 
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said on Tuesday that an expanding war in eastern Zaire was threatening humanitarian work and called for an end to the air raids . 
&quot; I hope this kind of attacks does not take place , &quot; she told a news conference . 
she said relief work in the region , where UNHCR says up to 400,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees are trapped amid fighting , would suffer as a result of increasing fighting . 
rebel leader Laurent Kabila said his forces would hit back at Zaire &apos;s military and commercial centre of Kisangani from where the attacks on Bukavu , Shabunda and Walikale were staged . 
&quot; These are terrorist actions . 
and we are going to get ready to take the war precisely to the place from where the bombers took off , &quot; Kabila told French LCI television on Tuesday . 
his brief interview signalled a further escalation in the four-month war and looked certain to complicate U.N. efforts to prevent the conflict spiralling across a volatile region . 
the defence official in Kinshasa scoffed at Kabila &apos;s threat but acknowledged that rebels were battling government troops on the ground around Amisi , 270 km ( 165 miles ) south of Kisangani . 
&quot; Kabila threatens to go to Kisangani but he knows he can &apos;t . 
he has no planes for that and Kisangani is a fortress , &quot; he said . 
Zaire &apos;s ethnic Tutsis took up arms after local authorities tried to expel them to their ancestral homeland in Rwanda . 
the war in eastern Zaire is intertwined with the ethnic conflict between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda . 
the Hutu army and civilian militias massacred up to 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994 before fleeing en masse into Zaire . 
Hutu hardliners in refugee camps in Zaire plotted revenge attacks on the Tutsi-led government that later took power in Rwanda , stoking tensions in the region .
