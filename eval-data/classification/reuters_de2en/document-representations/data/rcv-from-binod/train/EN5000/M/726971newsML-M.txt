Greek shares rose 0.59 percent clearing 1,600 points on upbeat industrial and banking stocks and brokers said blue chips were taking centre stage again . 
&quot; We are witnessing a return of trading interest in blue chips , especially those which produce headlines for their corporate action and expected interim profitability , &quot; said Lambros Papakonstantinou , managing director of P &amp; K Securities . 
&quot; This means that price imbalances between blue chips and second-tier stocks developed during this year &apos;s rally are accentuated , &quot; he added . 
but buying interest in blue chips was outweighed by supply on the same stocks at their intra-day highs . 
&quot; Today we saw increased supply in blue chips such as National Bank , OTE telecom and Titan cement at their intra-day highs , &quot; said Papakonstantinou . 
&quot; There seems to be strong buying interest at lower price levels although many investors are sidelined , &quot; he added . 
the market was seen consolidating its gains around 1,600 points following the recent 150 point rebound . 
&quot; Current trading is mostly linked to cherry picking rather than across-the-board buying , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The recent spike in prices has not been broadly-based . 
yet , the market is steadying itself above 1,550 points amidst thin trading .
