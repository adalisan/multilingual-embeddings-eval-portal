the Federal Reserve &apos;s move to hold U.S. monetary policy steady cleared the way for stocks to set new milestones , calming , for now , jitters that a rate hike would crimp wobbly corporate profit growth . 
&quot; We &apos;re going up , &quot; said David Shulman , chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers . 
the Dow industrials shed 40 to 5853 late Tuesday after surging briefly on news that the Fed , as expected by a some on Wall Street , decided to leave rates unchanged . 
the long bond was up 12 / 32 to yield 6.99 percent . 
&quot; At the moment , analysts , economists and traders are trying to distill all the news and ramifications of the Fed &apos;s inaction . 
we had a knee-jerk rally and are consolidating to inflationary implications . 
it &apos;s a positive . 
the volatility is helping to keep excesses minimized , &quot; said Eugene Peroni , chief technical analyst with Janney , Montgomery Scott . 
he said the market &apos;s technicals &quot; are still quite positive . 
I wouldn &apos;t be surprised to see a correction but the market has significant latitude for a two to three percent correction without disturbing its upward momentum . 
the Dow on Monday roared back from a 53-point deficit to end at a record closing high of 5894.74 . 
the tech-studded Nasdaq composite rose two to 1214 late Tuesday , not too far from June 5 &apos;s record finish of 1249.15 . 
stocks have been buoyed over the past week by renewed interest in the high-technology sector , which helped Wall Street snap record after record in 1995 . 
&quot; Tech stocks have been acting strongly , especially semiconductors , &quot; Peroni said . 
&quot; It helps to create an inspiring tone when economically sensitive stocks are doing this well . 
it opens a favorable outlook for earnings and the Fed &apos;s postponement of an increase should help to bolster the earnings outlook potential . 
Joseph Battipaglia , chief investment strategist at Gruntal &amp; Co , said , &quot; It &apos;s clear sailing from now to the middle of October before we start looking at third-quarter earnings . 
I think we &apos;ll get some good news on techs and the cyclicals will have a decent performance . 
though we didn &apos;t have a rally to 6000 on the ( Fed ) news , once we start seeing earnings we should have a sustainable rally through the elections . 
when asked if Wall Street was merely seeing the Fed &apos;s inaction Tuesday as a delay of an inevitable tightening after the elections , he said , &quot; It &apos;s the boy who cried wolf . 
the Fed can tighten at any point in the cycle and is keying off core CPI , gold , the dollar , and the overall level of confidence in the economy . 
there &apos;s nothing to react to in a negative sense . 
Salomon &apos;s Shulman said the falling dollar after the Fed &apos;s inaction pressured stocks and bonds . 
but he noted a weaker dollar would ultimately aid overseas profits for multinationals , boosting the bottom line for major U.S. corporations . 
&quot; We had some accidents and we &apos;ll probably have more preannouncements , &quot; Shulman said . 
&quot; The big issue is people are expecting a big acceleration in fourth-quarter earnings . 
Shulman said the near-term outlook for stocks also hinges on the outcome of congressional elections , on whether Democrats reassert control over Congress , and on economic data that will sway monetary policy . 
but , he noted , &quot; The path of least resistance is up .
