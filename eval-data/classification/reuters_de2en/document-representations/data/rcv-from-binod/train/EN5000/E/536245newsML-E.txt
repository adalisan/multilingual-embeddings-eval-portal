the German government on Thursday said sweeping reforms to the country &apos;s outdated tax system may have to be put off for a year after cross-party talks with the opposition Social Democrats ( SPD ) collapsed on Wednesday . 
some commentators said the political stalemate over tax reform could impair growth , imperiling Germany &apos;s efforts to slash its deficit to qualify for European monetary union ( EMU ) . 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl &apos;s right-hand man Wolfgang Schaeuble said cuts in corporate taxes planned for next year may have to be rolled into one tax-cutting package to take effect in 1999 . 
&quot; It would be worth considering postponing reductions in corporate tax , &quot; Schaeuble said , adding that cuts in pensions charges could instead be brought forward by a year to 1998 . 
the planned two-point cut in the 7.5 percent solidarity surcharge -- a levy raised to aid depressed eastern Germany -- would still take place on January 1 , 1998 , he said . 
Schaeuble &apos;s comments were the only political initiative to emerge after negotiations between the Kohl coalition and the SPD over Finance Minister Theo Waigel &apos;s plan to cut 30 billion marks ( $ 17.5 billion ) in taxes fell apart in acrimony on Wednesday . 
President Roman Herzog , in a rare political intervention , urged politicians to act quickly to fight unemployment . 
German dole queues , which peaked at a post-war record 4.7 million in the winter , are lengthening by a third of a million a year . 
&quot; We must act now , instead of just talking , &quot; Herzog said . 
newspapers poured scorn on the stalemate in Bonn , with the Bild daily slamming it as &quot; third-rate political theatre &quot; and questioning whether Germans would ever get a tax cut . 
other newspapers said fronts had hardened so much that no breakthrough was likely before parliamentary elections which will take place in October next year . 
the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said : &quot; One has to wonder about the high expectations invested in the attempt to reach an agreement via informal routes when media expectations were already crackling in expectation of the election campaign . 
the collapse of the talks means the government will have to push tax legislation through the usual parliamentary channels . 
Waigel expects his tax bills to clear the Bundestag lower house of parliament before the summer break . 
the SPD-controlled second chamber , the Bundesrat , will then bounce the measures back into parliament &apos;s mediation committee . 
there , the two antagonists would meet again to try and thrash out a deal in talks likely to take months which could easily result in the tax reforms being diluted . 
Schaeuble told German television on Wednesday night he believed &quot; the right concept will eventually win through &quot; . 
but economists and commentators warned that continuing uncertainty over the future costs of doing business in Germany could have potentially disastrous economic effects . 
the Chambers of Industry and Commerce ( DIHT ) , a leading business lobby group , on Wednesday called the talks &apos; failure &quot; a shock for the investment economy &quot; . 
the Handelsblatt business daily agreed : &quot; It is clear that the goings-on in Bonn will frighten off all foreign investors ; it is proof again of the country &apos;s inability to reform itself . 
economist Dieter Vesper of the DIW economic institute said the failure of the tax talks was &quot; poison for the economy &quot; . 
he told the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung Germany would struggle this year to meet the government &apos;s growth forecast of 2.5 percent . 
that could also be fatal for Germany &apos;s bid to qualify for European monetary union . 
although Waigel has pledged to meet the Maastricht treaty deficit target of three percent of GDP this year , independent economists say Germany will overshoot . 
Germany &apos;s authoritative six economic institutes this week predicted the deficit at up to 3.2 percent of GDP , while the International Monetary Fund sees the shortfall at 3.3 percent . 
Trumping that is the forecast of the SPD , which said the deficit would be 3.4 percent in 1997 , because tax revenues will fall 20 billion marks short of target and unemployment costs would exceed budgeted levels by 10 billion marks . 
&quot; Waigel &apos;s forecast is based on outdated figures , &quot; SPD budget spokesman Karl Diller told reporters .
