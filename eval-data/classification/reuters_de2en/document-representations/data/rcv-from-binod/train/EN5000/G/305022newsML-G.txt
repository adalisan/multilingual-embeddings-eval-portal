the former boss of France &apos;s Marseille soccer club , Bernard Tapie , and 20 others will go on trial on May 12 on suspicion of falsifying accounts in order to rig matches and transfers , justice sources said on Tuesday . 
the former high-flying tycoon and cabinet minister , who took Marseille to the European title in 1993 , is being accused of falsification , breach of trust and misuse of corporate funds . 
the other defendants , including six former club executives , face the same accusations . 
according to an investigating magistrate &apos;s report leaked to the media , Marseille misspent 101 million francs ( $ 19 million ) between 1987 and 1993 to fix matches by bribing players or referees and to lure star players . 
under Tapie &apos;s 1986-1994 presidency , Olympique Marseille dominated French and European soccer , winning four league titles in succession and playing two European Cup finals , the second of which they won by beating AC Milan 1-0 in May 1993 . 
Tapie is already awaiting the result of appeals against jail sentences for tax fraud and his part in rigging a French league match in 1993 . 
he was removed from the French National Assembly after being declared bankrupt and faces losing his seat in the European Parliament , his last political job .
