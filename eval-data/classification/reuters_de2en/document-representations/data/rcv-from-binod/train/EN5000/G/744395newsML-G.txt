Japan has called for a triangular relationship with the United States and China to contribute to regional prosperity and stability , a Hong Kong newspaper said on Monday . 
&quot; For regional prosperity and stability , what is necessary is a triangular relationship between Japan , China and the U.S. to be maintained in a stable and favourable manner and to see further development of this triangular relationship , &quot; Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda told the South China Morning Post . 
in an interview with the English-language daily earlier this month and published on Monday , Ikeda acknowledged Chinese concern over Japan &apos;s strengthening defence alliance with the United States . 
however , he was quoted as saying the link was indispensable for regional stability as long as much uncertainty remained . 
&quot; Unlike the situation in Europe , we do not have any multilateral security arrangement or system in the Asia-Pacific , therefore the Japan-U.S. alliance is necessary , &quot; he told the newspaper .
