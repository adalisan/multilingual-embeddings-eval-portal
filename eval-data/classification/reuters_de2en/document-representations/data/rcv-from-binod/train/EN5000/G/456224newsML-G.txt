the Senate on Thursday approved legislation criticising Mexico &apos;s performance in the anti-drug war and listing goals for stepping up its efforts . 
the measure was a compromise drafted in cooperation with the Clinton administration , which had opposed a House of Representatives vote last week to overturn President Bill Clinton &apos;s finding that Mexico has fully cooperated in fighting drugs . 
Clinton ruled on February 28 that Mexico was a reliable ally in the war against drugs , a step required to spare it U.S. economic sanctions . 
Congressional critics insist Mexico did not merit such a declaration and the House voted to overturn it , suspending its rebuke for 90 days to give Mexico time to improve its record . 
the House vote infuriated Mexico and the Senate agreed to a softer step which has no practical effect . 
after a week of intense wrangling , however , it is quite possible no Senate resolution will stand . 
Congress as a whole is required to act on certification within 30 days of Clinton &apos;s finding , meaning the House would also have to approve the Senate version this week , before a scheduled two-week recess , and it is already loaded with commitments . 
the Senate measure criticises the Mexican anti-drugs effort as inadequate on several points and requires Clinton to report by September 1 on progress by the U.S. and Mexican governments to improve matters . 
that date is well after the Mexican elections in July . 
approved by a vote of 94-5 , the measure requires progress on dismantling drug trafficking organisations , on strengthening bilateral cooperation and border enforcement and on denying safe havens to traffickers . 
the measure had been watered down to accommodate administration concerns that a harsh indictment of Mexico could torpedo the very cooperation that is being sought . 
negotiations between key senators and administration officials led by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin had gone into full bore after the House vote to overturn Clinton &apos;s &quot; certification &quot; of Mexico as a reliable drug ally . 
Sen Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat and one of three senators leading the negotiations with the administration , told the Senate that inadequate progress by Mexico would leave &quot; no alternative but to fuel up for another Mexico certification battle next year . 
opponents of the legislation argued that Clinton , by certifying a country that clearly was not cooperating fully , had failed to abide by the law . 
voting against the measure were Republicans Sam Brownback of Kansas , Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas , Bob Smith of New Hampshire , Craig Thomas of Wyoming and Democrat Robert Torricelli of New Jersey . 
the Senate measure lists a number of specific failures in Mexico &apos;s anti-drugs effort and concludes : &quot; There has been ineffective and insufficient progress in halting the production and transit through Mexico of illegal drugs . 
it says that much of the cocaine used in the United States comes from Mexico , that there is evidence that Mexican institutions are affected by &quot; significant corruption &quot; and that Mexico has yet to fully implement new law against organised crime and money laundering . 
it says Mexican drug cartels operate with impunity and Mexico has not honoured any U.S. requests to extradite Mexican nationals indicted in the United states on drug charges . 
the requested presidential report would detail progress by the two governments on dismantling drug trafficking organisations , on strengthening bilateral cooperation and border enforcement and on denying safe havens to traffickers . 
it would have to detail actions on crop eradication , money laundering and criminal screening of law enforcement officers . 
it calls for information on progress by the United States in anti-drug education , international drug interdiction and deployment of 1,000 additional immigration patrol agents .
