St Helens and Wigan received record fines on Friday following a mass brawl in a rugby league cup match last weekend . 
the clubs were each fined 15,000 pounds ( $ 24,300 ) by the Rugby Football League , half of it suspended for 12 months , after being found guilty of bringing the game into disrepute . 
a stiff-arm tackle by St Helens captain Bobbie Goulding , who will appeal against his subsequent eight-match ban , sparked prolonged fighting , but both clubs felt the punishment was too harsh and were seeking legal advice . 
in a statement , they said they &quot; jointly deplored &quot; the size of the fines and claimed the League had been influenced by the size of the television audience .
