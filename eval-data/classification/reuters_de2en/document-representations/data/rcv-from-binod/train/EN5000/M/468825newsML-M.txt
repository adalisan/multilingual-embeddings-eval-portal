Zimbabwean stocks traded weaker on Wednesday , depressed largely by a flow of funds into new issues and as market players turned cautious on February &apos;s higher inflation figure , brokers said . 
the key 59-share industrial index dropped 43.80 points to close at 10,277.09 and brokers said they expected the market to continued softening ahead of the Easter break . 
&quot; The market is softening a bit . 
the new issues are siphoning funds . 
the higher February inflation figure has also introduced a bit of caution in the market , &quot; a broker said . 
Zimbabwe &apos;s all-items consumer price index rose 5.4 percentage points in February from January , bringing the year-on-year inflation rate to 19 percent . 
&quot; People are waiting to see what the March figure will be like . 
if it goes up again the Reserve Bank might put breaks on money supply and interest rates may tick up which will have an impact on the market , &quot; said the broker . 
on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange on Wednesday , construction and plastics investor IHL and cement producer Circle each leapt 100 cents to 2,300 and 750 respectively while winery Afdis gained 20 cents to 480 and furniture and clothing retailer Tedco added 15 cents to 325 . 
among the losers , engineering group Gullivers at 300 , finance house UDC also at 300 , hotel and supermarket chain Meikles at 2,550 and sugar producer ZSR at 1,400 all shed 50 cents . 
Minings were dull as the price of gold continued under pressure in London after the rise in U.S. interest rates . 
the seven-counter mining index edged up 2.02 points to 995.32 , propped up by gold investor Falcon &apos; s 200 cent rise to 1,300 on what brokers said was a cheap buy .
