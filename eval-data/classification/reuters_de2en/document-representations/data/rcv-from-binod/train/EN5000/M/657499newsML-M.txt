the dollar steadied after remarks by a senior Japanese official overnight allayed trade concern and helped the U.S. currency claw back the bulk of its past four day &apos;s losses against the yen . 
Eisuke Sakakibara , the director general of the Japanese Finance Ministry &apos;s International Finance Bureau , said his Ministry will act &quot; decisively &quot; against excessive currency moves . 
he added fuel to fire by saying the issue of U.S.-Japan trade relations was &quot; being played up excessively &quot; and that Japan &apos;s current account surpluses won &apos;t be a major topic of discussion when leading industrial nations meet next week 
traders who had been expecting the dollar to fall below the six-month low of 110.62 yen it set Wednesday were caught short by his comments and the subsequent rebound in the U.S. currency . 
&quot; Considering there &apos;s been a five big-figure move in dollar / yen in little more than 12 hours , I would be very careful of doing anything , &quot; said Austin White , the foreign exchange manager at Yamaichi . 
&quot; The reasons for the dollar coming off in the first place haven &apos;t changed just because of what Sakakibara said , but the wild swings we have seen mean people will now hold tight and see what the U.S. position is . 
the dollar was quoted at 114.40 / 50 yen at 0820 GMT , from 111.20 / 25 late Wednesday in Europe . 
the mark rose to 66.35 / 38 from its 21-month low of 64.69 yesterday . 
dollar / mark was at 1.7244 / 49 from 1.7158 / 68 Wednesday . 
concern about the potential for trade tensions between the U.S. and Japan was sparked after U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Wednesday Japan should avoid running up external surpluses that would hurt global growth . 
Sakakibara today played down these fears and drew attention to the speech Summers will make later today , saying the American official was likely to comment on the issue of trade . 
summers will address the Computing Technology Industry Association conference at 1800 GMT , with Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin scheduled to speak at 1500 to the Council for Electronic Revenue Communication advancement &apos;s annual meeting . 
Rubin has already moved to ease trade concerns . 
he said Wednesday he agreed with Japan &apos;s goal of avoiding sustained increases in its external surpluses and promoting domestic-demand led growth . 
he also played down the importance of a short-term widening in Japan &apos;s surpluses . 
&quot; The U.S. and Japan are trying to firefight before it gets unmanageable , &quot; said Paul Meggyesi at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell . 
&quot; You can expect to hear more backtracking on the trade front today , &quot; Meggyesi said . 
meantime , the dollar also firmed against the mark amid hopes European Union countries will soon reach an accord on the budget deficit stability pact which requires them to observe fiscal discipline after they join economic and monetary union . 
expectations have grown that France , which asked Monday for time to consider the issue , will soon agree to the pact . 
European Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy said Thursday he believed a deal would be reached at the EU summit in Amsterdam next week . 
&quot; The easing of the problems vis-a-vis the stability pact has seen people move out of marks , &quot; said White at Yamaichi .
