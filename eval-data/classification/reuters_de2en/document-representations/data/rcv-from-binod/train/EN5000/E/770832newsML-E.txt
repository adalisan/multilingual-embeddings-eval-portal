nine analysts polled by Reuters said they expected the Bank of Portugal to leave key rates steady tomorrow . 
they said the lack of changes in official rates elsewhere in Europe and a recent slight weakening of the escudo made it unlikely that the Bank of Portugal would cut rates . 
but they all agreed that the central bank had room to cut rates further this year . 
the repo rate now stands at 5.70 percent , the draining rate at 5.40 percent and the emergency lending rate at 7.70 percent . 
the results of the poll are as follows : 
will the Bank of Portugal cut the repo rate this week ?

will the Bank of Portugal cut the draining rate this 
week ? 
no - 9 answers 
is there room for further rate cuts ?
