Peru &apos;s beleaguered President Alberto Fujimori spent a lonely New Year &apos;s Day in his office at Government Palace seeking a solution to the worst crisis of his political career . 
eating at his desk and avoiding contact with all but a small group of his closest advisers , Fujimori on Wednesday planned his next moves in the two-week standoff with a Marxist guerrillas holding 74 hostages in Lima . 
seven more captives were released on Wednesday . 
&quot; He is very serious , very worried , virtually silent , &quot; said a source close to Fujimori speaking on condition of anonymity . 
&quot; Every time there is a big problem like this , he closes up completely . 
following the Dec . 17 takeover of the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence , the normally publicity-loving Fujimori put up a wall of silence and virtually disappeared from public view . 
in a few fleeting appearances , the president has looked worn and grave-faced . 
most recently , at a New Year &apos;s Eve mass for the hostages , he kept well away from the press and huddled with a group of ministers and security guards . 
he was believed to be furious at the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement &apos;s ( MRTA ) propaganda coup on Tuesday . 
under an apparent agreement between the government and the rebels , a group of journalists was allowed to approach the residence wall for the first close-up images of the siege . 
but when a photographer for Japanese news agency Kyodo News broke ranks and went up to the front door , MRTA leader Nestor Cerpa Cartolini decided to allow them all in for a two-hour photo opportunity and interview . 
&quot; He &apos;s annoyed . 
and wouldn &apos;t you be ? 
they took the initiative and made a mockery of him , managing to send their faces and words all round the world in minutes , &quot; another Government Palace source said . 
as well as Tuesday &apos;s impromptu press conference , the MRTA updates daily its magazine , Rebel Voice , on the Internet , maintains contact with journalists via electronic mail and has even set up an international spokesman in Germany . 
the contrast with Fujimori could not be more stark . 
he has only made one public speech since the crisis began -- a two-minute statement of his resolve not to give in to terrorism and a challenge to the MRTA to lay down arms and release their captives . 
government Palace sources said Fujimori was relying most heavily for counsel on security adviser Valdimiro Montesinos . 
a shadowy and controversial figure who is hardly ever seen in public , Montesinos has played a key role in cracking down on guerrillas since Fujimori won elections in 1990 . 
he is widely considered the president &apos;s unofficial right-hand man . 
after Montesinos , the sources said , he has had most contact with Education Minister Domingo Palermo , a low-profile minister surprisingly chosen as the government &apos;s mediator . 
&quot; Other than them , it &apos;s been the interior minister ( Juan Briones Davila ) , the defence minister ( Tomas Castillo ) and ( Economy Minister Jorge ) Camet who Fujimori has been seeing most of , &quot; one of the sources said . 
for family comfort , Fujimori has had his daughter Keiko Sofia at his side from the outset . 
&quot; She &apos;s not playing a political role , but she &apos;s helping him handle the stress , &quot; the source said . 
the president &apos;s political pressure has been accentuated by a personal angle to the crisis -- his brother Pedro is still among the more than 70 hostages inside .
