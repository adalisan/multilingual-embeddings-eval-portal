a car bomb exploded in central Algiers on Tuesday , killing six people and wounding scores , including 10 seriously , an official Algerian statement said . 
&quot; It was a very big one . 
it shook the embassy , &quot; said a U.S. embassy employee in Algiers reached by telephone . 
the Algerian security forces , in a statement read on the state-run Algerian television , said the car bomb went off at 4 : 50 p.m. ( 1550 GMT ) at Boulevard des Martyrs in the working-class Sidi M &apos;hamed district in Algiers . 
an earlier provisional official death toll said the bomb killed five and wounded scores of people . 
it was the third blast in Algiers in three days . 
on Sunday a car bomb killed at least 21 people -- an Algerian newspaper put the toll as high as 42 killed and more than 100 wounded . 
a bomb exploded outside a school on Monday but caused no casualties . 
on Tuesday , a foreigner working near Place Addis Ababa in Algiers said : &quot; We heard a very big blast about a half hour ago . 
it was a huge one . 
speaking on Algerian radio a witness said : &quot; I was lying down watching the television when there was a huge noise ... They ( the bombers ) are not human beings . 
they are attacking families , and even old people . 
more than 300 people have been killed in a series of bombings and massacres in Algerian cities and villages , mostly in Algiers and surrounding towns , since November . 
the leader of the Armed Islamic Group ( GIA ) has warned that his Islamic rebel group will step up attacks in Algeria during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan that started on January 10 , an Algerian newspaper reported on Tuesday . 
&quot; The war will continue and will be intensified during the month of Ramadan . 
we have the means and the men to punish all those who are not on our side , &quot; GIA leader Antar Zouabri said in a statement posted on the walls of some mosques in northern Algeria and quoted by El Watan newspaper . 
at least 160 people have been killed and more than 200 wounded in Algeria since the start of Ramadan . 
militant fundamentalists regard the Moslem month of fasting as the month of jihad -- holy war -- against the secular military-backed government . 
political analysts believe the killings are a message to President Liamine Zeroual , as well as to Algerians , that the fundamentalists are still a formidable force despite repeated claims by the government that it has crushed the guerrillas . 
about 60,000 people have been killed in Algeria &apos;s violence since 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead .
