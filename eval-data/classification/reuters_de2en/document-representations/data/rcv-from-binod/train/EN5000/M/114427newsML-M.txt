CBOT soybean futures dropped to session lows in late trading on fund selling , traders said . 
&quot; It looks like maybe prudential selling and at least two milion bushels , &quot; a trader said . 
the market already had been weakened by spillover pressure from Friday &apos;s bearish USDA crop production report . 
&quot; There &apos;s more fund liquidation , &quot; a trader said .
