the Australian sharemarket closed lower on Tuesday with losses steepening in the afternoon as nervous investors trimmed positions ahead of the U.S. opening . 
at the close , the All Ordinaries index was down 19.8 points at 2,262.3 . 
the September share index futures slid 21 points to 2,266 and was at a 3.7 point premium to the underlying index . 
brokers said selling emerged following weakness in both local and U.S. bond markets with investors worried U.S. yields would continue to rise after nudging seven percent on Monday . 
&quot; It &apos;s taken a dive today , &quot; said a Sydney-based dealer . 
&quot; There are plenty of sellers about although volumes are not exceptional , &quot; he said . 
turnover at A $ 641 million was substantial , though suggestive of a hedging of positions rather than a wholesale selldown . 
&quot; Commonwealth Bank going ex-dividend had an effect but overall it &apos;s been taken down by selling from people worried about U.S. ( interest ) rates . 
positions are being cut while things are sorted out over there , &quot; the dealer said . 
others saw things in the same light , saying a lack of positive inspiration had seen recent strong profits cashed in . 
&quot; With no guidance people have sold off and taken some profits , &quot; said dealer Peter Struk of brokerage Reynolds and Co . 
in corporate features , aluminium producer Comalco continued to slide after Monday &apos;s disappointing profit result . 
engineering and hardware group Howard Smith bucked the trend to finish stronger after reporting a 12 percent higher full year net profit of A $ 86.13 million . 
falls outnumbered rises by a ratio of about nine to seven , while about 33 percent of stocks traded remained steady .
