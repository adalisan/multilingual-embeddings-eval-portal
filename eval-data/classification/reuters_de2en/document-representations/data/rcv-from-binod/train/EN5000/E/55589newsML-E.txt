Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on Monday he hoped to spur trade and investment between Chile and his country , which he admitted &quot; does not have a perfect democratic system . 
Alatas said Indonesia and Chile were negotiating an accord to protect and promote each others &apos; investments and that each could be the other &apos;s bridge for trade into their respective regions . 
&quot; Our trade relations will be important not only for the Chilean and Indonesian market , but rather we should consider ourselves as the entrance-way to our respective regions , &quot; Alatas , who arrived on Sunday for a three-day visit , told reporters . 
Chile has been pushing for stronger trade ties with Asia and set up permanent commercial offices at Chilean embassies in most capitals in southeast Asia , partly as a way of balancing its traditional dependence on trade with the Americas . 
trade between Chile and Indonesia totalled about $ 230 million last year , strongly in Chile &apos;s favour thanks to its copper exports which alone came to $ 161 million . 
asked by reporters about Indonesia &apos;s political system , Alatas admitted his country does not have a great record on human rights . 
&quot; We are aware that we do not have a perfect democratic system nor in the human rights situation , &quot; he said through an interpreter . 
&quot; We have the greatest respect for what Chile is doing and in turn we expect the rest of the world to understand that the Indonesian people must do what is best for it .
