Sinn Fein , the IRA &apos;s political wing , and British officials will end a 16-month talks freeze on Wednesday in a bid to revive Northern Ireland peace hopes shattered by guerrilla bombs and sectarian violence . 
political sources said Martin McGuinness , chief negotiator for Sinn Fein , would meet civil servants for the first time since the Irish Republican Army ended a 17-month truce in February 1996 by setting off a huge bomb in east London . 
late on Tuesday , Britain was reported to have decided to repatriate two convicted Catholic republican prisoners from English jails to a Northern Ireland prison in what could be a move to smooth relations with Sinn Fein . 
but as both sides prepared to meet in Belfast , outlawed Protestant &quot; Loyalist &quot; guerrillas urged Britain not to dilute its demand for an unequivocal IRA ceasefire and said republican guerrilla violence risked plunging the region into fresh strife . 
tension has been high amid IRA resurgence and signs that a truce by their Loyalist foes is crumbling . 
Sinn Fein , which wants an unconditional seat in multi-party peace talks , has been cold-shouldered by London , Dublin and Washington because of IRA violence but has scored significant electoral advances recently . 
new British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced last week he would ease a ban on official contacts so that Britain might determine whether the IRA and Sinn Fein were prepared to commit themselves fully to peaceful methods . 
the IRA has repeatedly ignored widespread calls to end hostilities so as to pave the way for Sinn Fein to be brought into the talks . 
the Loyalists remain unconvinced . 
the shadowy Protestant Ulster Freedom fighters ( UFF ) said Britain must not relax its insistence on a total end to IRA attacks . 
the UFF , which has killed Catholic nationalists in a campaign to thwart the IRA &apos;s aim of ending British rule in the province , said London should not &quot; distort the ( peace ) process to the advantage of republicans . 
the entry conditions for Sinn Fein are non negotiable . 
the UFF , one of a group of Loyalist militias that have operated a shaky truce since October 1994 , said that &quot; if the IRA fail to bring their campaign to an end they run the risk of pulling our society back into bloody conflict . 
the IRA went back to war accusing Blair &apos;s predecessor John Major of reneging on a deal to give Sinn Fein speedy entry to talks . 
Republicans say there must be no question of another &quot; decontamination period &quot; blocking Sinn Fein from talks in the event of a new truce . 
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams told the Irish News daily in Belfast that Britain should state &quot; with absolute clarity &quot; that Sinn Fein would immediately be able to enter talks if the IRA called a ceasefire . 
Blair said in a keynote speech in Belfast last week that the IRA must match words with deeds to prove that any future ceasefire is meant to last .
