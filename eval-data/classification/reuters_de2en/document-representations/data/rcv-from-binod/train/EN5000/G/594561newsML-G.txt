jailed Colombian drug bosses have placed President Ernesto Samper and U.S. 
Ambassador Myles Frechette on a hit list of assassination targets , police said on Monday . 
police intelligence sources confirmed a report in Bogota &apos;s El Tiempo newspaper which said the so-called hit list was drawn up in reprisal for recent moves in Colombia &apos;s Congress to end the country &apos;s six-year-old ban on the extradition of drug lords and other criminals . 
other figures on the list include National Police director Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano and Carlos Medellin , an outspoken proponent of extradition who stepped down as Justice Minister last month . 
&quot; The drug traffickers &apos; goal was to assassinate a nationally and internationally known figure to press against the approval of extradition , &quot; a police spokesman told Reuters . 
a spokesman for the National Prison Service ( INPEC ) said the authorities were studying the possibility of opening an investigation to see exactly who had drawn up the hit list , but said no firm decision had yet been taken . 
police said that security measures for all the potential targets including Frechette , had been beefed up as a result of the murder plot , which was uncovered through wiretaps on telephone lines in the maximum security wing of Bogota &apos;s La Picota prison . 
a police informant was also instrumental in uncovering the plot , the spokesman said . 
Colombia &apos;s constituent assembly , acting under enormous pressure from criminal drug gangs , banned extradition in 1991 . 
but the Senate constitutional affairs committee voted on Tuesday to lift the ban , opening the door to the possibility that the practice will be restored within the next year . 
U.S. law enforcement officials have said repeatedly that detention in a secure prison facility in the United States is what Colombian drug lords fear most .
