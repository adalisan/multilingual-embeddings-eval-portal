volatilities of over-the-counter gold options soared over the past few days , with one-month levels reaching 10 percent as spot gold dived , dealers said . 
&quot; Last Friday vols hammered up during the last few hours of COMEX trading and yesterday things were also very volatile in early Europe , vols were exploding , &quot; one dealer in Europe said . 
implied volatilities for one-month options were bid as high as 10 percent on Monday , up from 6.1 percent at the end of last year , he said . 
but on Tuesday , one-month volatilities pulled back to about 8.75 percent , dealers said . 
&quot; Even though there &apos;s still some activity , it doesn &apos;t warrant those high rates , &quot; a dealer in London said . 
another said despite any short-term easing , volatilities should generally hold their firmer stance in coming weeks . 
for some dealers , most of the activity in recent days was in strikes close to the money , with trading seen in both puts and calls . 
one dealer said the delta ranged from 33 percent to 40 percent , with the widest strikes about $ 1.50 from spot levels . 
the interest has been focused on short-term dates , from one to three months , they added . 
another dealer , however , said he had seen business in strikes from $ 350 to $ 370 . 
&quot; But I think people have very little on their books below $ 350 and not much below $ 360 . 
today we did see some interest in $ 350s , &quot; he said . 
volatilities in longer dates also were firmer , but not to the same extent as one month material . 
three months implied volatilties were bid at 7.5 to 8.25 percent , six months at 7.3 to 7.5 percent and one-year at 7.0 to 7.2 percent .
