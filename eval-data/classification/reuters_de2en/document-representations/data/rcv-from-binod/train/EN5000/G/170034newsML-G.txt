Croatia became the 40th member of the Council of Europe on Wednesday in a ceremony disrupted by a brief protest over alleged violations of press freedom in the former Yugoslav republic . 
a handful of demonstrators from the Paris-based Reporters sans Frontieres ( Reporters without Borders ) group unfurled a banner and threw leaflets as Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic signed the Council &apos;s charter . 
&quot; Croatia violates freedom of the press , &quot; the banner said , accusing Croatia of persistent threats against the satirical and muck-raking Zagreb weekly Feral Tribune . 
Croatia is the third former Yugoslav republic to join the Council , which seeks to promote democracy and human rights , after Slovenia and Macedonia . 
( corrects to add that Macedonia is also a member of the Council ) 
the Council approved its membership last month afer a six-month delay over human rights concerns . 
last month , a Croatian court acquitted two reporters from Feral Tribune of charges they defamed President Franjo Tudjman . 
they were the first journalists indicted under a controversial new clause in Croatia &apos;s criminal code enacted to protect the reputation of top state officials . 
regarded as an antechamber to the European Union , the Strasbourg-based Council froze Croatia &apos;s application in May and set conditions concerning respect of the Dayton peace agreement ending the war in Bosnia , democracy and press freedom .
