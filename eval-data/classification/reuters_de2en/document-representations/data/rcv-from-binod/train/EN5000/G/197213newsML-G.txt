German politicians on Monday rallied to the defence of about 600 former Soviet Army deserters who fear they will soon be deported from Germany to almost certain jail sentences back home in Russia . 
the opposition Greens party called on the Bonn government to say what it is doing about the deserters , who fled their barracks in eastern Germany in the early 1990s and have been waiting since then for political asylum . 
Horst Eylmann , Christian Democrat ( CDU ) head of the Bonn parliament &apos;s legal committee , suggested German courts should block any deportations and Moscow should consider an amnesty . 
the embarrassing issue of the deserters , a potential irritant in Germany &apos;s otherwise good relations with Russia , has surfaced in recent weeks after press reports revealed several of them had suddenly been denied asylum this year . 
the men say they fear long prison sentences for desertion and because they had to discuss military matters with western intelligence offices when they applied for asylum . 
&quot; They say , and I think with some reason , that they face a very uncertain fate , &quot; Eylmann told Reuters . 
&quot; The courts must give them asylum or at least stop the deportations . 
another possibility would be if Russia would grant amnesty to these 600 . 
there are some signs in this direction . 
during the Cold War , Moscow had 380,000 troops stationed in East Germany , a key Warsaw Pact front line state . 
when Germany reunited in 1990 , Chancellor Helmut Kohl let them stay until 1994 so Moscow could withdraw them in an orderly way . 
but , with discipline weakening and the lure of Western consumer goods just outside their barracks gates , many soldiers slipped away and applied for political asylum . 
by mid-1991 more than 200 had fled . 
many complained of mistreatment , poor living conditions and ethnic tensions in the army . 
thanks to Germany &apos;s liberal asylum laws , they were allowed to stay pending court decisions on their cases . 
Alexander , a former officer in his late 20s who now lives near Munich , said he and his wife had heard nothing about their case for five years . 
&quot; Then suddenly we got a refusal in May , &quot; said Alexander , who asked that neither his family name nor any other details about himself be published . 
&quot; Now we are appealing it and are waiting for a date in court . 
when he applied to stay , the Russian was interviewed at the main centre for asylum-seekers in Zirndorf , near Nuremberg . 
afterwards he was given the numbers of three offices there which he had to visit to answer more questions , he recalled 
&quot; Nobody told me these were intelligence services , &quot; Alexander said . 
&quot; But in the course of the talk , it became clear to me these were purely military questions . 
Russia punishes desertion with up to seven years in prison , with heavier penalties , including the death sentence , if a deserter allowed himself to be interrogated by a foreign intelligence service , according to a recent report by the Frankfurt-based International Society for Human Rights . 
the Interior Ministry declined to answer questions about the deserters , saying it would soon respond to a parliamentary question tabled by the Greens .
