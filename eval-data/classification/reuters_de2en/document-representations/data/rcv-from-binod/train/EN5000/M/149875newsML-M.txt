London cocoa futures finished slightly higher but mostly off their peaks on Tuesday with the market still struggling to break away from its recent lows . 
&quot; The market performance is not that good . 
the maximum we managed to do is get up to about 12 stg off the lows and we &apos;re finishing back down in the middle of the range , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; The market finds it difficult to make any headway on the upside , &quot; he said . 
traders said activity was modest and there was a lack of significant news to provide fresh stimulus . 
by the close , March stood six stg up at 961 after trading between 955 and 966 . 
in spreads , the Dec / March switch was seen traded at 30 stg . 
values took a tumble on Monday , pushing the March contract to a new contract low of 954 stg amid speculative and trade selling after a large increase in New York longs . 
traders said the 11,000 lot increase in speculative longs in the U.S. , as reported by the commodity futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) , outpaced market expectations . 
market attention has turned to first cocoa arrivals from the Ivory Coast after the season officially opened last week . 
in one latest development , shipping sources say cocoa stocks at the Ivorian port of Abidjan totalled around 90,000 tonnes , but shipments could be blocked if exporter and freight reference rates are not set soon . 
October arrivals reached about 40,000 tonnes , New York-based General Cocoa said . 
exporters expect November arrivals to be over 200,000 tonnes or more because of stocks carried over from 1995 / 96 . 
broker GNI said the strength of sterling and expected strong Ivorian arrivals could dent any positive market sentiment . 
&quot; Look for 915 stg soon , &quot; it said . 
it did not elaborate .
