the Norwegian statistics office said on Thursday it expected the country &apos;s economy to continue to show strong growth this year and saw no signs of it overheating in 1998 . 
in a new forecast , Statistics Norway ( SSB ) kept unchanged from a first-quarter report its official projection for overall GDP in 1997 at 3.1 percent . 
the government department upgraded estimates for 1998 GDP to 4.2 percent from three percent in the February report . 
&quot; The rise in the business cycle in the Norwegian economy is now in its fourth year .... , &quot; SSB &apos;s report said . 
&quot; A strong increase in oil investment contributes to driving the growth while impulses from the traditional exports appear to be weaker this year than last year . 
but the bureau &apos;s national account figures for first-quarter overall GDP -- a rise of 0.5 percent year-on-year and a fall of 0.1 percent from the fourth quarter 1996 -- took the market by surprise , according to analysts . 
&quot; The first quarter was surprisingly low but some of this may be attributed to a run-down in inventories , &quot; said Jon Eriksen at London-based I.D.E.A. 
&quot; The new forecast should be reassuring to the market because the statistics office does not see any signs of the economy overheating . 
private consumption seems surprisingly well-behaved despite lower interest rates and rising income , &quot; he said . 
SSB downgraded estimates for private consumption in 1997 to 2.5 percent against 3.1 percent in the February report . 
it attributed the revision to a levelling out of car sales despite lower interest rates over the past two quarters . 
the bureau brought into line with the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank its estimate for consumer price ( CPI ) growth in 1997 to 2.4 percent . 
in its February outlook it indicated 1997 &apos;s CPI at 1.8 percent mainly due to a strong appreciation in the Norwegian crown at the beginning of the year . 
both Norges Bank and the Finance Ministry have forecast inflation this year at around 2.5 percent . 
the SSB said employment was expected to reach record high levels and forecast unemployment at 4.2 percent this year and at 4.0 percent in 1998 . 
it warned that with such low jobless rates there was a danger of strong wage growth in the future although this had not been apparent following this year &apos;s wage settlements .
