Mexico &apos;s trade surplus could reach $ 6 billion by the end of 1996 , leaders of Mexican trade organizations said on Monday . 
&quot; We &apos;re seeing a ( trade ) surplus of more or less $ 6 billion , which will probably come down next year , &quot; said Juan Elek , president of the Mexican business council known as CEMAI . 
Luis Rebollar Corona , president of the National Association of importers and Exporters ( ANIERM ) , said exports could total $ 100 billion this year . 
the predictions came in a news conference to announce details of the fourth Mexican Overseas Congress to be held Nov 6-8 in Puerto Vallarta . 
leaders said the goal of the congress would be to promote exports for small and medium-sized businesses . 
&quot; The statistics show us that of 25,000 exporting businesses , only 580 account for 85 percent of exports , which means we have to be more effective , &quot; said Gilberto Marin Quintero , president of the National Council for Foreign Trade ( CONACEX ) .
