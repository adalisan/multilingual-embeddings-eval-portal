Indonesian palm olein prices were generally stable in late trading on Monday as buying interest remained thin amid falls in Malaysia , traders said . 
they said palm olein was quoted at 1,390-95 rupiah / kg in Jakarta , unchanged from the opening but lower than last Friday &apos;s close of 1,400 rupiah . 
crude palm oil was done at 1,191 rupiah / kg in the North Sumatran city of Medan at a tender on Monday , compared with the previous tender price of 1,213 rupiah . 
&quot; The market was generally quiet , with players not keen on taking fresh positions because of falls in Malaysia , &quot; one said . 
&quot; The crude palm oil tender price was considered high , as the second best bid was some 15 rupiah less , &quot; the trader said . 
&quot; The margin will be slim if the oil is processed into olein for the local market at the current price . 
the traders said that a lack of support in Malaysia was dampening sentiment in the Indonesian market , which looks to Kuala Lumpur for price direction . 
data from Belawan Port showed that the MT Istana I left the North Sumatran port for Tanjung Priok , Jakarta , on Saturday with 1,700 tonnes of palm olein .
