Canada &apos;s trade surplus jumped to a record C $ 4.02 billion ( $ 2.97 billion ) in August from C $ 2.89 billion ( $ 2.14 billion ) in July amid surging exports to the United States , the government said on Friday . 
the government agency Statistics Canada said exports rose 2.7 percent in August to a record C $ 23.15 billion ( $ 17.13 billion ) , led by strong vehicle shipments and a rebound in the sales of grain and other agricultural products . 
stronger automotive exports accounted for a record C $ 19.17 billion ( $ 14.19 billion ) of exports to the United States in August . 
shipments to all other trading partners , except Japan , also rose , Statistics Canada said . 
the strong trade numbers immediately boosted Canada &apos;s financial markets , with the Canadian dollar rising on the news amid speculation that Canada &apos;s economy will record another current account surplus in the third quarter . 
in the second quarter of 1996 , Canada posted a current account surplus of C $ 1.15 billion ( $ 851 million ) , the first surplus since the fourth quarter of 1984 . 
John Johnston , deputy chief economist at RBC dominion Securities Inc . , said Canada &apos;s lower inflation would let the Canadian dollar rise by one U.S. cent a year without disturbing the strength in exports . 
statistics Canada also said imports weakened in August , mostly due to slower shipments of machinery , industrial goods and auto parts . 
Canada &apos;s trade surplus has risen steadily as a proportion of gross domestic product , reaching 4.5 percent in the second quarter of 1996 compared to 0.5 percent in 1991 , the agency said . 
the upward trend in exports since the second quarter of 1995 largely reflects economic strength in the United States , Canada &apos;s largest trading partner . 
about C $ 1 billion ( $ 740 million ) worth of goods crosses the border between the two countries every day . 
by contrast , Canada &apos;s imports have remained flat in the past year , reflecting relatively weaker domestic demand , Statistics Canada said .
