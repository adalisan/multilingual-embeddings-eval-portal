Bosnia &apos;s collective presidency met on Serb-held territory for the first time on Friday and discussed setting up a peacetime government . 
international mediator Carl Bildt who attended the meeting said the atmosphere between the Moslem , Croat and Serb members was &quot; businesslike &quot; . 
Bildt told reporters the presidency , elected on September 14 , was moving forward &quot; step by step &quot; after several weeks of haggling over the venue for their sessions . 
meeting in the Sarajevo suburb of Lukavica , it was the first time the three-man body convened on Serb-controlled land . 
only a year ago the arrival of the Moslem chairman of the presidency , Alija Izetbegovic , and Croat member Kresimir Zubak in the Serb-held suburb would have been unthinkable . 
in a breakthrough meeting on Tuesday , the Serb member of the body , Momcilo Krajisnik , ended his boycott of presidency sessions after a compromise was reached to meet alternately in different territories . 
he also signed an oath of loyalty to Bosnian statehood , effectively renouncing Serb war aims for a separate state and opening the way for regular work of the presidency . 
&quot; They are talking about a number of issues that have to do with the work of the presidency , &quot; Bildt said . 
the three presidents discussed the nomination of a chair of a council of ministers as well as forming a constitutional court and a central bank . 
under terms of the Dayton peace agreement , the council consists of a chairman and at least two other members , a foreign minister and a trade minister . 
the newly-elected House of Representatives would have to approve the candidate nominated by the presidency . 
the presidents also discussed nominations for foreign representatives serving on a constitutional court . 
three names were proposed but the Serb member , Krajisnik , suggested that a Greek judge be included . 
the Serbs enjoy friendly ties with the Greeks , who share their Orthodox Christian faith . 
the presidency also met an envoy from the International Monetary Fund who proposed a candidate to serve as governor of a three-member board for a new central bank . 
according to a post-war constitution , the central bank should have a three-member governing board led by a foreign representative appointed by the IMF . 
the Dayton treaty preserved Bosnia as a loose union with a common presidency and House of Representatives ruling over autonomous Serb and Moslem-Croat territorities . 
the joint institutions are supposed to govern by consensus and the constitution allows Serb , Croat or Moslem communities to oppose any measure which its representatives view as destructive to their vital interests .
