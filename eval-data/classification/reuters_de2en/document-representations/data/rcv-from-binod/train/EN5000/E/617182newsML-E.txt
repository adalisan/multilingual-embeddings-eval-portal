Ireland &apos;s central bank on Tuesday revised up its growth forecast for the Irish economy yet cut its inflation forecast which some economists said left financial markets more confused than happy . 
in its annual report , the central bank said inflation this year would be around 1.8 percent , down from 2.3 percent at the previous forecast , despite economic growth of 5.75 percent , revised up from a previous estimate of 5.5 percent . 
&quot; They have revised their growth forecast upwards while there has been a 10 percent depreciation in the currency against sterling in the last six months , and yet they revise inflation down . 
it is a very surprising situation , &quot; Bank of Ireland group treasury economist Jim Power told Reuters . 
power said the figures were likely to confuse more than they clarify and threw into question the method of calculation used by the central bank to predict economic indicators . 
the central bank said the inflation forecast depended on the &quot; evolution of the exchange rate &quot; during most of 1997 , adding that monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability as the priority . 
but at a news conference to launch the report , central bank governor Maurice O &apos;Connell would not be drawn on exchange rate policy given the recent battering suffered by the Irish pound . 
the Irish pound has fallen 10 pfennigs in the last month on speculation that Ireland will enter EMU at its central Exchange Rate Mechanism ( ERM ) level of 2.41 marks . 
the Irish unit is currently trading at 2.5750 marks and the market is concerned that it will run into further speculative selling in the near term . 
&quot; In essence the report will have a very muted response in the market which is far more concerned about the level of the Irish pound against the German mark and concern that we will see further bouts of overseas selling , &quot; Allied Irish Investment Bank economist Pat O &apos;Sullivan said . 
when pressed on whether the Irish pound will enter EMU at its central rate the central bank governor said that the European Union had not yet made a decision on the exchange rates at which countries would join EMU and there were &quot; a number of possibilities &quot; for the rate at which Ireland would join . 
&quot; Nothing at all has been decided . 
it is much too early to settle this , &quot; he told the news conference . 
the low inflation / high growth forecasts led some economists to question the model used by the central bank to forecast indicators . 
&quot; It just goes to prove that their ( the central bank &apos;s ) whole model for predicting inflation is not working , &quot; said one economist , who did not wish to be identified . 
some economists felt the figures highlighted the fact that the central bank has been crying wolf for the last 18 months about potential inflationary pressures . 
&quot; All the indicators they pointed to as potential problems have all turned out worse than they expected , yet inflation is being revised downwards , so it does call into question the bank &apos;s methods of calculation , &quot; Power said . 
&quot; The currency moved against us , fiscal policy remains very loose and yet they are revising their inflation forecast downwards . 
they should not just be issuing warnings about inflation for the sake of it , &quot; another economist said .
