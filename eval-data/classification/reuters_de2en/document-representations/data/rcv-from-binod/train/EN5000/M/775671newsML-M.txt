Singapore gas oil swaps lost some of its early morning gains late afternoon on Monday but was still above Friday &apos;s prices despite an unexpectedly low award from India for September arrival cargoes , traders said . 
&quot; The market is hoping that the whole complex will go up because of the three cat-cracker shutdowns in Europe , &quot; one trader said . 
August was last quoted at $ 22.50 / $ 22.60 , up slightly from Friday &apos;s $ 22.45 / $ 22.55 , but down from this morning &apos;s $ 22.60 / $ 22.75 , brokers said . 
August traded earlier in the day at $ 21.50 compared to Friday &apos;s traded intra-day low of $ 22.45 after news of the low India award first filtered through the market , they said . 
September also settled five cents higher with trades seen earlier in the day at $ 23.25 and $ 23.29 , brokers said . 
traders said the market discounted India &apos;s low purchase of 90,000 tonnes of high-speed diesel in two cargoes for September delivery , even though it was well below the market &apos;s most conservative estimate of 200,000 tonnes on Friday . 
&quot; This is a low volume time of the year , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; But the fact that India took the much lower volume is surprising . 
I think they are trying to talk down the market in anticipation of some term talks . 
in Europe , two catalytic converters , one at the BP / Texaco Nerefco refinery in Rotterdam and one at the BP / Mobil Coryton refinery in the U.K. were shut down on Friday due to technical problems , taking out 115,000 barrel-per-day ( bpd ) of capacity until the middle of next week . 
in addition , Shell confirmed on Friday that the cat-cracker at its Pernis refinery has closed for an unscheduled stoppage in August followed by a scheduled maintenance of two months . 
the shutdown of these two units led to August gas oil ending up $ 2.50 on London &apos;s International Petroleum Exchange on Friday to $ 171.50 per tonne . 
August fuel oil was steady at $ 101.25 / $ 101.75 per tonne , brokers said .
