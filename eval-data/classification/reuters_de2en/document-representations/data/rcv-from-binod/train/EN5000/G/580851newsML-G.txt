an Indonesian man was sentenced to death on Tuesday for the murder of three people in the United States , one of them his brother . 
the central Jakarta district court found Harnoko Dewantono guilty of killing two Indonesians and an Indian citizen in Los Angeles in 1991 and 1992 . 
&quot; We sentenced the defendant to death because we cannot find reasons to acquit him . 
the defendant has sadistically and cruelly murdered his own brother and his close friends , &quot; presiding judge I.G.K. 
Sukarata said in the verdict . 
Dewantono , wearing a black suit and tie , showed no emotion when the sentence was handed down . 
he said he would appeal against the verdict . 
if his appeal is rejected , he can ask for a presidential pardon . 
government prosecutors said Dewantono killed Indian business partner Suresh Mirchandani in August 1991 and murdered his brother Erry Prihartono and his Indonesian school friend Gina Sutan Anwar in 1992 . 
government prosecutors said Mirchandani died of a bullet wound in his chest and that his body was wrapped in a plastic bag with the hands chopped off . 
Anwar and Prihartono died after being hit on the head with blunt objects . 
Los Angeles police unsuccessfully sought the extradition of Dewantono , a former U.S. resident , after the three bodies were found in a leased storage locker in August 1994 . 
Dewantono had by then returned to Indonesia , where he was arrested and tried .
