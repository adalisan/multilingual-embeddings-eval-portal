the Czech Republic said on Monday it was opposed to big powers deciding on NATO enlargement and the alliance &apos;s relations with Russia without input from smaller countries . 
foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told a news conference a French-proposed summit of the United States , France , Britain , Germany and Russia would not be the right forum in which to decide on plans to expand NATO eastwards . 
&quot; For us it is clear that a conference of superpowers would not be the right solution , &quot; Zieleniec told reporters . 
the United States has also reacted coolly to the idea . 
&quot; Today &apos;s alliance is composed of a variety of countries large and small , and custom has shown clearly that decision-making on Europe &apos;s fate , where all take part , is the best and favours stability , &quot; the minister said . 
Zieleniec said he was sure the Czech Republic would be in the first wave of countries asked to join NATO after the alliance &apos;s Madrid summit in July and that enlargement would happen by April 1999 , when the alliance celebrates its 50th birthday . 
asked whether he was concerned over Russia &apos;s strong opposition to NATO enlargement , the minister said he was confident that Czech relations with Russia could improve . 
&quot; I have a feeling that the Czech Republic entering the alliance will help these relations ( with Russia ) but it will allow both sides clearly to define our positions , &quot; he said . 
he said any accord between NATO and Russia should be a &quot; declaration of a political will &quot; rather than a formal treaty . 
Zieleniec said he was against holding a referendum on Czech membership of NATO , saying none of the 16 current members had held one before joining the organisation . 
the main Czech opposition party , the Social Democrats , supports NATO entry but demands a referendum . 
Zieleniec played down recent public opinion polls showing that only 37 percent of Czechs support membership , saying support would increase as debate on the issue picked up .
