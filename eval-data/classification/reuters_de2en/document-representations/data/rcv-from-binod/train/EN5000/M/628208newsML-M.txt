Brent crude futures in Asia were untraded but slightly higher around midday on Friday , in line with a firmer tone on NYMEX . 
July Brent was quoted on SIMEX at $ 19.48 / $ 19.59 per barrel , after London July futures gained 24 cents to settle at $ 19.48 . 
brokers said the slightly firmer showing in Asia followed a modest rise of NYMEX crude on the after hours access system . 
July NYMEX rose 18 cents to $ 20.97 in New York , after trading as high as $ 21.28 . 
but by the settlement it failed to hold ground above $ 21.00 . 
July last traded at $ 21.05 per barrel , up eight cents from New York . 
however , volume was a slight 241 lots . 
brokers said both markets were consolidating after the fall in prices earlier this week and fresh direction might not appear until next week . 
NYMEX front month was looking to hold above $ 20.50 and Brent above $ 19.00 to indicate further upside potential .
