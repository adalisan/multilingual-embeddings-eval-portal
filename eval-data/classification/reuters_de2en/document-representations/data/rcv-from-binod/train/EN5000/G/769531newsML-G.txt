the U.S. army will shift its Panama-based southern headquarters to Fort Buchanan in Puerto Rico , beginning in October 1998 , Army Secreary Togo West said on Thursday . 
the move stems from the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty that mandates the departure of all U.S. military forces from Panama by December 31 , 1999 . 
the U.S. Army South command now comprises nearly 3,000 active duty soldiers and 2,000 civilian employees . 
the move should be completed by September 1999 , the army said . 
the U.S. Army South is a component of the U.S. Southern Command , the unified armed forces regional command , which will be moving from Panama to Miami by September 29 this year . 
Puerto Rico is a U.S. commonwealth .
