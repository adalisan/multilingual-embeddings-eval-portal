U.S. West Coast crude prices turned mixed in late morning trade , with lights falling ahead of the September crude expiry and heavies rising on higher posted prices . 
most major oil companies increased their California posted crude prices prices by 50 cents late Monday , in line with the recent rally in futures . 
the increase in postings lifted Kern River to $ 13.90 / 14.40 a barrel , versus $ 13.50 / 14.00 the previous day . 
differentials were seen unchanged . 
Wilmington also rose with postings to $ 15.90 / 16.00 . 
but outright prices for lights came under pressure from spot WTI trade , which turned lower in New York midsession trade ahead of the futures contract expiry today . 
but ANS differentials were unchanged , with most refiners claiming they were adequately supplied or waiting to see Canadian prices before buying incremental crude for September . 
however , one major refinery bought at $ 1.95 a barrel under September WTI Monday . 
&quot; I thought they would be able to do wider , &quot; another refiner said , referring to the 10-cent fall in ANS deltas since August . 
prices for Line 63 also tracked the fall in WTI values , with no spot deals done in recent weeks and supply and demand seen balanced in the thinly traded market . 
Pre-nominations for Line 63 shipments will begin late Tuesday , with restrictions announced with two days .
