SIMEX Euroyen and Japanese government bond ( JGB ) futures traded listlessly on Monday as a lack of fresh factors and the impending Lunar New Year and EID Al-Fitr holidays kept most players from taking new positions . 
&quot; It was a typical Monday . 
most dealers were looking for direction and local players are all staying flat towards the holidays , &quot; said a dealer with an Asian futures house . 
most financial markets in Singapore will be closed on February 7 and 10 , and although SIMEX will remain open , dealers said activity was likely to be subdued . 
&quot; ( March ) JGBs are holding well above 126.00 . 
technically , they look very bullish , &quot; said the trader , adding that they faced resistance around 126.60 initially . 
they settled at 126.35 against their opening 126.55 . 
December was at 99.21 against 99.20 . 
dealers said the Nikkei &apos;s slight drop on Monday had no impact on the Japanese interest rate market . 
the dollar &apos;s relatively unexciting session in forex markets also provided no cues as players turned cautious of pushing the unit higher ahead of a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven ( G7 ) nations this week . 
but most dealers remained bullish about the U.S. unit &apos;s prospects , seeing any declines on the back of possible G7 pressure as merely providing an opportunity to buy it . 
U.S. interest rate futures edged up ahead of the Federal Reserve &apos;s two-day policy-setting meeting from Tuesday . 
&quot; The undertone for Eurodollars is influenced by bonds , which are reversing from their recent downturn , &quot; said the dealer . 
he said the Fed was not expected to raise rates at its meeting this week , but noted that most players were resigned to a rate hike at some point . 
&quot; A quarter percent hike is being priced in but anything more would be interesting , &quot; he said .
