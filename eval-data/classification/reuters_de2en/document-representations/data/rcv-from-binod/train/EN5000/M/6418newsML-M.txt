Commission house and fund buying lifted CSCE coffee futures higher Wednesday , fueled by concerns about a scarcity of available coffee for delivery against the September contract , traders said . 
with spot September &apos;s first notice day on Thursday , traders noted that September open interest was still relatively high at 3,356 lots as of August 20 , compared with the low level of certified stocks . 
&quot; It is a typical tight stock situation , &quot; said Smith Barney analyst Walter Spilka . 
he said a decline in U.S. certified coffee stocks this week underscored the shortage of nearby supplies . 
exchange inventories dropped 6,259 60-kg bags in the week ended August 16 , to 34,516 bags , their lowest levels in 10 years . 
the CSCE also reported 19,000 bags of coffee pending certification , but while traders and analysts said the pending coffee would help ease supply woes , not all the coffee was expected to meet Exchange approval . 
spot September settled up 2.55 cents a lb , at 125.05 . 
Most-active December closed 1.95 cents higher at 117.00 cents , after reaching a peak of 118.40 . 
dealers noted origin selling near the highs trimmed gains . 
dealers said the switches were heavily traded , with the closely watched September / December switch widening to 8.05 cents on Wednesday , compared to 7.45 cents at Tuesday &apos;s close . 
on the charts , traders said the December contract would face stiff resistance at 120.00 , while support was seen at 115.00 . 
volume was heavy , at an estimated 12,238 lots .
