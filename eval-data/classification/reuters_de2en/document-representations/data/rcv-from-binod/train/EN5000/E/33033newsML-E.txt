yields on Treasury securities at &quot; constant maturity &quot; are interpolated by the U.S. Treasury from the daily yield curve . 
this curve , which relates the yield on a security to its time to maturity , is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded Treasury securities in the over-the-counter market . 
these market yields are calculated from composites of quotations reported by five leading U.S. 
government securities dealers to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . 
the constant maturity yield values are read from the yield curve at fixed maturities , currently 3 and 6 months and 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 20 , and 30 years . 
this method provides a yield for a 10-year maturity , for example , even if no outstanding security has exactly 10 years remaining to maturity .
