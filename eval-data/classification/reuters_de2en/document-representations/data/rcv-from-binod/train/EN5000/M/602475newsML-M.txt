COMEX gold futures hovered near unchanged in late morning Wednesday , while other New York precious metals traded at slightly lower levels in quiet trading . 
a decision by the Federal Open Market Committee on Tuesday to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged helped underpin sentiment in the bullion market , dealers said , but the overall tone was fairly muted . 
gold crept above the widely-watched $ 343 per ounce mark , climbing to $ 343.60 amid scattered speculative buying . 
but the upswing failed to gather steam , and gains were quickly pared . 
at 1114 EDT , June was at $ 343.30 , down 10 cents an ounce on the day . 
news that U.S. trade deficit shrank by a whopping 19.3 percent , to $ 8.51 billion during March appeared to weigh on the market , dealers said . 
most economists had forecast a shortfall of around $ 10 billion . 
the U.S. dollar firmed against most European currencies on the news , dampening buying interest in gold . 
traders said a report released earlier today by the World Gold Council -- which cited huge increases in gold demand in developing countries -- could fuel some new buying , but the specter of gold sales by European central banks continued to hang over the market . 
&quot; In long run what the Gold Council is saying is probably very bullish , but that probably won &apos;t have an impact until we get the Euro sales out of the way , &quot; one trader said . 
the white metals also drifted in lower ranges after failing to follow-through from yesterday &apos;s rally . 
July futures were $ 3.50 lower , at $ 392.50 an ounce . 
with palladium &apos;s first notice day on the horizon , commodity funds were keen sellers on the nearby spreads , dealers said . 
outright commercial selling on the June contract was also noted .
