the Venezuelan Bolivar slumped in heavy trade to 478.00 / 479.00 per dollar in an apparently deliberate move by the Central Bank to let the unit soften , traders said . 
the fall &quot; makes sense as the exchange rate has been anchored flat for some time now , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; The Central Bank only sold gobbits of dollars in the morning , and then mostly let the exchange rate slide in the afternoon , &quot; he added . 
the Bolivar closed Monday at 477.50 / 478.50 . 
the Bolivar has depreciated less than three percent since exchange controls were removed almost exactly a year ago -- despite domestic inflation of over 70 percent .
