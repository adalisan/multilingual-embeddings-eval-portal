a British mine clearance specialist who was kidnapped in Cambodia seven months ago is alive and well in the Khmer Rouge stronghold of Anlong Veng , a breakaway Khmer Rouge commander said on Sunday . 
Chea Bunheng , commander of regiment 41 in Anglong Veng , said Christopher Howes was still alive , though Chea Bunheng had not been able to see him . 
Chea Bunheng said he believed Howes is being forced to make homemade bombs for hardline Khmer Rouge guerrillas . 
Howes , of the British-based Mines Advisory Group ( MAG ) , and his interpreter Houn Hourth were abducted in the northwest province of Siem Reap in March . 
in August the Bangkok Post cited an unnamed officer of the Khmer Rouge as saying Howes had been executed in the Maoist group &apos;s Anlong Veng stronghold . 
it said Houn Hourth died of malaria in July . 
Khmer Rouge radio later denied the group had killed Howes . 
Chea Bunheng made the comments in this northwestern town while attending a ceremony for breakaway Khmer Rouge dissidents . 
he said he and some former hardline rebels were joining a group of breakaway soldiers who split from hardliners loyal to Pol Pot in August . 
there are an estimated four to six million landmines scattered around the country , a legacy of more than two decades of civil war in Cambodia .
