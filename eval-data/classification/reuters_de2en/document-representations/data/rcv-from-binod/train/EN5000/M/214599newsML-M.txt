the Italian lira and bond markets ended firmer on Monday on optimism over the currency &apos;s return to the European currency grid and hopes of early interest rate cuts , but the stock market closed easier after reports of judicial problems for Prime Minister Romano Prodi . 
after 17 hours of talks at the weekend European Union ministers finally agreed on a central rate of 990 per mark for the lira to rejoin the exchange rate mechanism ( ERM ) . 
&quot; No-one &apos;s screaming buy the market , but the ERM return marks the beginning of something which could be quite positive for Italy , &quot; said Oriano Moro , trader at Gestnord brokers here . 
&quot; It &apos;s like passing your driving test . 
now we &apos;ve got our licence let &apos;s see if we can actually drive , &quot; Moro added . 
the all-share Mibtel index firmed in early trade but then reversed gear and ended 0.48 percent down , rattled by reports a Rome magistrate had asked for Prodi to be charged with abuse of office when he headed state industrial holding IRI in 1993 . 
Italian BTP bond futures , which hit new historic highs in morning trade and also retreated on the reports , recovered to end firmer on hopes of an interest rate cut in coming weeks . 
the lira , after touching a high of 989.80 per mark , was steady at a late 990.25 / 990.55 . 
&quot; As far as Prodi is concerned , we &apos;re waiting for further information -- it had a bad impact but the market settled when he said that he had done no wrong , &quot; a Milan equity dealer said . 
&quot; The Prodi news led to some position-squaring , &quot; a bond market trader said . 
&quot; But the market still has further upward scope especially in view of imminent rate cuts , &quot; he added . 
in Brussels , Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said he hoped the lira &apos;s return to the ERM would not slow down a cut in Italian interest rates &quot; which the economy badly needs . 
finance Minister Vincenzo Visco was even more upbeat , telling reporters in Rome the lira &apos;s re-entry to the grid would result in further cuts in the Bank of Italy &apos;s key discount rate . 
a Reuter poll of economists on Monday showed that most forecast the central bank cutting 50 basis points off its 7.50 percent discount rate by the middle of December . 
Moro pointed out that markets had widely expected the lira , cast out of the ERM in a currency crisis in September 1992 , to return to the grid over the weekend . 
&quot; There &apos;s no euphoria with people saying the future &apos;s rosy now we &apos;re back in . 
the market looks slightly overbought technically and some consolidation is expected , &quot; he said . 
Luca Jellinek , bond strategist at Paribas in London , said domestic investors considered the lira &apos;s return &quot; a good thing &quot; . 
&quot; They &apos;re not looking too closely at the details and the fact that the French and Germans played hard ball which isn &apos;t too good for EMU , &quot; he said . 
Italy was readmitted to the grid at a stronger level than Rome had wanted and one agreed after hours of tough negotiations with its EU partners , notably Germany . 
Marco Nascimbeni , head of operations at Carnegie Italia brokers , said the stock market was very quiet . 
&quot; What is stopping stocks from rallying is the perception that some investors are taking their profits from some export-oriented companies . 
we think 990 is reasonable , the difference is negligible . 
the result is all about giving a good message to our partners , &quot; he said . 
Nascimbeni also said the future reaction of the stock market was tied to developments on the 1997 budget bill which he saw being finally approved in parliament in the next 10 to 14 days . 
Italian investors remained optimistic about the prospects for stocks and foreign investors were looking for the right time to return to the Italian market , he said .
