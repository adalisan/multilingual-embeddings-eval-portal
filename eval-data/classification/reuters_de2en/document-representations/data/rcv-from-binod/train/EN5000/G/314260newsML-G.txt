when it comes to celebrating victories Primoz Peterka is already a champion -- as his father has found out to his cost . 
after claiming the coveted Four-hills trophy this season , Slovenia &apos;s new teenage ski jumping hero set to work on his dad &apos;s facial hair . 
&quot; I gave him a Hitler-style moustache and , obviously , that was too much for him . 
he shaved it off the next day . 
Peterka , it seems , is enjoying his second season on the World Cup circuit , having already recorded five victories . 
shortly after topping the podium for the second time , in Harrachov in the Czech Republic , he was down at the local disco dancing into the early hours of the morning . 
the following day , Peterka proved he does not need a full night &apos;s sleep to perform by finishing second on the same hill . 
coach Jelko Gros is the man with the job of keeping the exuberant 17-year-old , from the village of Moravce near the Slovenian capital Ljubljana , in check . 
&quot; I am still the one who decides when we celebrate or not , &quot; Gros said . 
&quot; That night must have definitely cost him his hard-earned pocket money . 
keeping teenage ski jumping sensations on the straight and narrow is no easy task as Finns Matti Nykanen and Toni Nieminen have showed in the past . 
Nykanen , the most successful ski jumper ever with four Olympic golds , was never far from the headlines for his off-hill activities . 
twice married and twice divorced , he was constantly at loggerheads with officialdom and suffered from a persistent drinking problem . 
after fading out of the sport he was forced to sell his medals when his business activities failed . 
Nieminen won two Olympic golds as a 16-year-old but found the pressures of media attention too tough to handle and soon vanished from view . 
despite his laid-back approach to his sport , Peterka , who began ski jumping aged six , currently holds a 162-point lead over Germany &apos;s Dieter Thoma and 260 over Austria &apos;s Andreas Goldberger . 
he was the first Slovenian to clinch the Four-hills tournament -- one of the three most prestigious events in ski jumping next to world championships and the Winter Olympics . 
in it , Peterka finished seventh and first in the German resorts of Oberstdorf and Garmisch-Partenkirchen and then kept his nerve to take second and third places in the Austrian legs at Innsbruck and Bischofshofen . 
but it wouldn &apos;t have been the end of the world if I would have lost , &quot; he said . 
but despite his current form , Peterka is still not thinking about the overall ski jumping title . 
he has decided to skip events in Japan ( in Sapporo on January 18 and 19 and in Hakuba on January 25 and 26 ) , to prepare for the world championships in Trondheim , Norway , from February 21 to March 2 . 
&quot; It will be difficult for him to keep the lead in the overalls if we don &apos;t go to Japan , &quot; Gros acknowledged . 
&quot; But there are some 30 athletes who are capable of winning it so it will be difficult in any case . 
&quot; We still have a lot of time before we start thinking about the overalls . 
we have other goals at the moment . 
&quot; I have decided to first concentrate on the world championships , then on the ski flying ( in Tauplitz , Austria , on February 8 and 9 ) and only then will I start thinking about the overalls , &quot; Peterka said after impressive back-to-back wins on the Titlis hill in Engelberg , Switzerland last weekend . 
an economics student when he is not ski jumping , Peterka , who was named Slovenia &apos;s sportsman of the year in 1996 , will not have to worry about money this winter . 
he is currently the highest earner on the circuit with 119,500 Swiss Francs ( $ 86,600 ) in prize money . 
his closest rival , Thoma , has earned 65,500 Swiss Francs ( $ 47,500 ) . 
&quot; He is the best paid ski jumper at the moment and all his awards go straight into his own pocket . 
it is not true that his money is taken away from him , &quot; said Gros , denying rumours Peterka was not allowed to keep his prize money . 
Gros brushed aside fears Peterka could be become blinded by success and go the same way as Nykanen and Nieminen . 
&quot; He ( Peterka ) is still as modest and calm as he was before his successes , &quot; Gros said . 
&quot; He is a very stable person and this is his advantage . 
he still acts the same as before .
