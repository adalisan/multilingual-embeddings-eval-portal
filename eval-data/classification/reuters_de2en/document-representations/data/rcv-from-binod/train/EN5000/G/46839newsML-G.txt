the rebel Taleban militia seized Afghanistan &apos;s main eastern city of Jalalabad on Wednesday and vowed to enforce Islamic Sharia law in surrounding Nangarhar province , Afghan sources said . 
Taleban spokesmen in neighbouring Pakistan and witnesses and other Afghan sources said the Islamic militia captured the provincial capital with very little fighting . 
they seized Jalalabad hours after troops loyal to President Burhanuddin Rabbani &apos;s government in Kabul took control from a previously neutral council . 
later the militia fighters advanced on the 75-km ( 45-mile ) eastern highway to Pakistan and had come up to five km ( three miles ) from the Torkham border crossing , Afghan sources said . 
before the battle for the town began , an apparent peace mission ended in bloodbath when Nangarhar acting governor engineer Mahmood and 69 other people were shot dead while driving towards the Pakistan border , a survivor said . 
former Nangarhar corps commander Fazle Haq Mujahid told reporters at the Pakistan border that the attack was carried out by the fighters of a rival commander apparently to avenge the murder of his brother . 
a Pakistan-based Afghan news service , the Afghan Islamic Press ( AIP ) , said the group seemed to be heading for peace talks with Taleban leaders when they were shot . 
Mahmood , a commander of the neutral Hezb-i-Islami faction of Maulvi Mohammad Younis Khalis , was killed only hours after he had been appointed acting governor of Nangarhar . 
an Afghan government spokesman accused Pakistan of conspiring and aiding the Taleban attack , signalling a return to frosty relations between the two governments . 
a Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman rejected the charge as unfounded and said Islamabad had been trying to promote intra-Afghan talks to bring peace to the war-shattered country . 
Pakistan evacuated eight staff members of its consulate in Jalalabad after government troops arrived there earlier on Wednesday to try to stop the pre-announced Taleban advance , a staff member said . 
a Pakistani mission official said 15 United Nations officials had been trapped in their Jalalabad office while a U.N. plane awaited for them at the airport . 
there was no further information about their evacuation . 
&quot; We have taken over the ( Jalalabad ) city and the airport with blessings of God , &quot; Taleban field commander Mullah Burjan said in a statement . 
&quot; We will enforce Sharia and maintain complete peace in Nangarhar . 
Taleban movement leader Mullah Mohammad Omar , based in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar , directed his field commanders to treat Nangar people well and harm no one , Taleban militia sources said . 
Mullah Mohammad Rabbani was named the new Nangarhar governor replacing the previous neutral governor Haji Qadeer , who had fled to Pakistan on Tuesday . 
Taleban , which seeks to topple Rabbani , already rules half of Afghanistan and the capture of Jalalabad , which is about 120 km ( 75 miles ) east of Kabul , will give it an effective control over the country &apos;s main road access to Pakistan . 
AIP said there had been severe fighting in some areas of Jalalabad and there were some casualties . 
but no exact figures were available . 
Amrullah , an Afghan government spokesman in Kabul , earlier told reporters that the Taleban had seized Jalalabad airport and street fighting was raging in the city . 
government jets bombed Taleban positions and supply routes on Wednesday , he said .
