the leaders of Georgia and its rebel province of Abkhazia pledged on Friday to resolve their differences peacefully but reported no breakthrough on an overall agreement to end their conflict . 
Abkhazia has had de facto independence since routing Georgian government forces in fighting in 1992-93 which cost 10,000 lives . 
but it is not recognised by any state . 
a statement , signed by Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and Abkhaz separatist leader Vladislav Ardzinba at the end of their talks , said the sides agreed &quot; to take upon themselves the obligation not to use arms to resolve differences between them and under no circumstances to allow a resumption of bloodshed . 
&quot; Only peaceful political methods through negotiations should be used , &quot; it went on . 
it said the two sides &quot; managed to agree on a series of key problems on resolving the conflict . 
but at the same time , there remain significant differences &quot; . 
Ardzinba &apos;s surprise visit was his first to Tbilisi since the war began exactly five years ago , when Georgian troops marched into the subtropical province on the Black Sea to put down moves towards independence . 
Western diplomats and U.N. officials have told Abkhaz leaders that there is no prospect of recognition as an independent state . 
talks on reaching a full political agreement have been deadlocked and the latest round of United Nations-mediated negotiations has produced no tangible results . 
the tussle with Abkhazia is one of several bloody conflicts which have bedevilled Georgia since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 . 
Shevardnadze , humiliated by the loss of what many consider the most beautiful and richest part of the country , sees his role in Georgian history as recovering the province . 
the statement signed by Shevardnadze and Ardzinba said the sides agreed &quot; to take upon themselves the obligation not to use arms to resolve differences between them and under no circumstances to allow a resumption of bloodshed . 
it said the two sides &quot; managed to agree on a series of key problems on resolving the conflict . 
but at the same time , there remain significant differences &quot; . 
Shevardnadze , speaking after the signing , called the talks a &quot; major political event ( which had ) overcome a very complicated and difficult psychological barrier &quot; . 
Ardzinba also sounded a positive note . 
we had very fruitful and constructive talks , &quot; he said , adding that they would help to restore trust between the sides destroyed during the war . 
Georgian opposition politicians slammed the agreement as a sham and as little more than a propaganda coup for Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov , who accompanied Ardzinba and acted as a mediator during some of the talks . 
such documents have been signed before . 
Shevardnadze just followed Russia &apos;s order to accept Ardzinba , &quot; said Irina Sarishvili-Chanturia , leader of the centre-right National Democratic Party told Reuters . 
&quot; Ardzinba doesn &apos;t need peace because he &apos;s got everything he wants already , &quot; she said . 
Primakov had said he hoped to prepare a deal between Georgia and Abkhazia to pave the way for a formal peace agreement to be signed in Moscow in the presence of President Boris Yeltsin . 
Yeltsin has recently supported the Georgian position that Abkhazia should be part of Georgia but receive wide autonomy , and that the separatist government should allow at least 150,000 ethnic Georgian refugees to return to their homes . 
Abkhazia has argued for a type of &quot; union state &quot; confederation , repeatedly rejected by Tbilisi . 
Russia also has 1,500 peacekeepers in a buffer zone between Abkhazia and Georgia .
