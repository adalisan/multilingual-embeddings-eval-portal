the Chief of the Defence Force wants to talk with Qantas and Ansett about pilot career paths , in an attempt to orchestrate future departures of Air Force pilots . 
the Air Force is concerned about the growing number of its pilots accepting lucrative contracts , with about 80 RAAF pilots expected to leave the Air Force this financial year . 
that &apos;s prompted increased recruitment of foreign pilots and consideration by the Federal Government of special retention pay for defence personnel . 
defence Force Chief , General John Baker , says the Defence Force should plan for the fact that after 15 years of flying in the Air Force , many pilots will go out and fly commercially . 
the Chief of the Defence Force , General John Baker , says a review of Australia &apos;s security outlook should be conducted every three years . 
defence Minister Ian McLachlan has asked the Defence Force to examine any possible military threats facing Australia , and the region at large . 
general Baker says he would have been surprised if the new Government did not ask for a new strategic review after assuming office , as the last one was carried out in 1993 . 
he &apos;s told the National Press Club in Canberra strategic circumstances had changed in the Asia-Pacific region since then , and a review is needed to keep the Force &apos;s thinking modern . 
an pilot who helped investigate the Blackhawk disaster says a change in the course flown contributed to the accident . 
the inquiry , sitting in Sydney , is trying to find out why two Army Blackhawk helicopters collided in mid-air during a counter-terrorism exercise near Townsville , killing 18 soldiers . 
captain Gary Lee told the inquiry that on the night run , when the accident happened , the formation of the six aircraft was lower and left of the track that had been flown during the day . 
captain Lee said if the track was to be changed , there should have been a night rehearsal . 
he said he found the targets difficult to spot wearing night vision goggles . 
the effect of rising fuel prices is set to hit international airfares . 
Qantas will increase prices on all routes out of Australia from December the 15th . 
Ansett hasn &apos;t yet decided whether to follow suit , but a decision is expected within 24 hours . 
Qantas says tickets already purchased for travel after December the 15th will be exempt from the rise . 
last week , both Qantas and Ansett lifted the price of domestic airfares by two-and-a-half per cent , citing rising fuel costs as the reason .

Penguin researcher from the University of Tasmania , Cindy Hull , says over fishing is one of the most likely causes for the drop in numbers . 
Ms Hull says the future of the Royals is anything but secure . 
she says if a human induced or natural disaster was to occur , the population would be at great risk .

the National Eutrophication program will focus on algae in catchments in Victoria , New South Wales , Queensland and Western Australia .

strange lights have been sighted in the sky over Alice springs for the third consecutive night , but there may be an earthly explanation . 
one resident told ABC radio she saw six orange lights move slowly through the sky last night , before hovering over the Pine Gap satellite-monitoring facility , just out of town . 
the weather bureau says it can &apos;t explain the lights , but a caller to talkback radio has suggested pranksters are placing fire starters in orange plastic bags , then floating them off into the sky . 
police say they &apos;ve had a report of a tree being set alight after a plastic bag containing heat beads landed on it .
