world oil prices on Monday were hovering near 12-month lows as traders decided that seasonal demand for gasoline in the West was falling below expectations . 
and analysts said prices over the next few months would struggle to resume the rally which took crude to six-year highs last winter . 
&quot; The pressure on prices remains downward , &quot; said Geoff Pyne at Swiss finance house UBS . 
&quot; There &apos;s nothing positive the market can cling on to at the moment . 
speculative investment funds cashed in their chips on crude futures exchanges in New York and London on Friday , helping push prices close to their lowest levels since June last year . 
London July futures for benchmark North Sea Brent blend crude on Monday were down six cents at $ 17.65 a barrel on top of a 62 cent slide on Friday . 
&quot; The funds gave oil a second chance in May but now they seem to be washing their hands of it , &quot; said a futures trader in London . 
&quot; Stocks are up , supplies are comfortable and the gasoline season has ended before it even got started . 
Brent has lost $ 3 in less than a month , and is $ 7 below January &apos;s high , amid a build in stocks of motor fuel in the gasoline-greedy United States . 
cool spring weather across the country has stemmed demand from casual drivers . 
traders and analysts said worldwide demand for crude oil , though rising strongly , had proved no match so far this year for the growth in extra supplies . 
&quot; Demand is strong but it &apos;s just not strong enough , &quot; said Pyne . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see any reason why the market should go back up in the next three to six months . 
Russell Hill , senior trader at Austrian oil company OMV said he had pencilled $ 15- $ 18 Brent into projections for the remainder of the year . 
renewal last week by the United Nations of its humanitarian oil deal with Iraq will swell supplies when exports from Baghdad resume in a few weeks . 
at lower world prices than in the first six months of the arrangement , Iraq would have to export larger volumes to meet the $ 2 billion of sales allowed under U.N. terms . 
current low oil prices come just two weeks ahead of the Organisation of the Petroleum exporting Countries &apos; ( OPEC ) summer ministerial conference . 
the cartel , widely expected to leave production quotas unchanged for the second half of the year , nevertheless continues to pump rising supplies as most members ignore their official allocations . 
estimates put OPEC output in recent months not far below 27 million barrels a day ( bpd ) nearly two million bpd in excess of its combined official ceiling .
