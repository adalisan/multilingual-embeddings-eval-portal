the Irish Republican Army said on Wednesday it carried out a bomb ambush in which police officers narrowly escaped injury . 
responding to Tuesday night &apos;s attack in the city of Londonderry , the British government vowed to protect Northern Ireland from a resurgence in guerrilla violence . 
Sir John Wheeler , British minister for security affairs in the province , sought to allay concern about the latest spate of incidents , saying extremists would be found and put behind bars . 
in a telephone call to a local journalist , using a code-word , the IRA said it carried out the Londonderry attack . 
police sources said officers had a lucky escape when a device planted by a road in the province &apos;s second city exploded as their two armoured cars passed . 
Wheeler said security was under constant review . 
&quot; There is nothing that the government can do to ensure that these terrorist crimes don &apos;t occur again , because they have been occurring in one form or another over the past 18 months , but what the police and security forces can do is to give the public the maximum possible protection , &quot; he told BBC radio . 
&quot; And they can guarantee this -- those who commit these crimes will find themselves being arrested , charged , going before the courts , being convicted and going to prison for a long time . 
Wheeler urged pro-British Loyalist foes of the IRA to maintain their 26-month ceasefire which he conceded was &quot; very fragile &quot; . 
security sources suspect that the IRA probably used a home-made horizontally launched mortar bomb or a landmine in the Londonderry attack . 
the ambush , which was condemned by the main Irish Catholic nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party , came 36 hours after an IRA rocket attack injured a policeman in a security hut at the heavily protected law courts in Belfast . 
that incident added to tension after a spate of recent attacks and bomb alerts , and it was followed by a series of bomb hoaxes that disrupted traffic in the provincial capital . 
politicians from the main pro-British Ulster Unionist Party ( UUP ) on Wednesday demanded an urgent meeting with police chiefs while a member of the Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) said Britain must take on the guerrillas . 
Campbell suggested that Britain should reinstate checkpoints and high-level security at the border with the Irish Republic where control on crossing points was eased during a 17-month IRA truce that ended in February 1996 .
