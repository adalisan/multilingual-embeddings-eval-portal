London &apos;s white sugar market took a backseat role on Monday , nervous to see how the dust settled in New York after heavy fund buying sparked a sharp rally in October raws in the last session . 
but if there was no follow-through buying when the raws opened later , then producers were likely to take the opportunity to sell the London market , which has also held its strength from the end of last week . 
October raws surged 38 points to hit 11.93 cents / lb on Friday but then slipped to close at 11.86 . 
concerted buying of March calls at 12.50 cents / lb forced extra position covering and added to the rally , traders said . 
&quot; I would still expect producers to come in and sell London , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; If the funds don &apos;t follow through , I think we &apos;ll see some ( whites ) selling coming in , &quot; he said . 
but on Monday morning the London market was quiet . 
at 1130 GMT only the three nearby positions had been traded and prices were tightly mixed . 
October was down 60 cents at $ 328.00 and December up 10 cents at $ 325.50 . 
volume amounted to a light 169 lots . 
in fundamental news , Syria tendered to buy 26,000 tonnes of white sugar and 26,000 of raws for October delivery , as an amendment to the August 7 tender . 
the sugar is to be delivered in two equal shipments of 13,000 tonnes of white sugar and two others of 13,000 tonnes of raws . 
September 9 is the date set to receive price offers . 
traders in Indonesia said reports of local interest in buying white sugar emerging from London were probably part of the state import schedule . 
Indonesia was expected to import between 1.0 million and 1.1 million tonnes of sugar this year , almost unchanged from 1996 . 
the Paris market rallied on Monday morning , the first session after Friday &apos;s closure for a public holiday . 
both October and December stood $ 4.30 higher , at $ 327.80 and $ 325.10 respectively . 
but MATIF volume was light at just 38 lots .
