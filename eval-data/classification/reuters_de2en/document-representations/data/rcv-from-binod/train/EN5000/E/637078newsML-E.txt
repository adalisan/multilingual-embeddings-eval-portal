as New York City officials neared an accord on the fiscal year 1998 budget , Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday that he was close to a compromise with the City Council over its proposal for job-inducing tax cuts . 
&quot; I think there are always grounds for a compromise , and I think we have one , &quot; Giuliani said when asked about the tax break , one of the sticking points in the budget negotiations . 
&quot; But let &apos;s wait until the end of the day or tomorrow . 
city Council officials said they expected an agreement on the budget , which takes effect July 1 , to be announced Wednesday . 
city officials are looking at June 10 as day a budget accord could be completed . 
Giuliani had earlier resisted Council Speaker Peter Vallone &apos;s proposal to grant $ 40 million in tax breaks to &quot; emerging &quot; industries such as software development and biotechnology . 
but officials said he was willing to accept a broader plan aimed at spurring jobs . 
officials involved in the negotiations said the mayor also was prepared to accept a City Council proposal to reduce the unincorporated business tax ( UBT ) by offering credit against the personal income tax . 
the officials said the mayor was willing to accept a figure close to the $ 75 million UBT reduction the City Council had proposed .
