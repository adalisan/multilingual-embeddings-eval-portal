Germany &apos;s planned comprehensive tax reform will favour services and other less-capital-intensive industries , Germany &apos;s six leading economic research institutes said on Tuesday . 
the reform will have an overall positive impact on the labour market , its main goal . 
but its effect will be felt most by industries that have lower investments , the institutes said in a semi-annual report . 
industries with a higher level of investment will see their taxes rise , but the lowering of corporate tax rates should reduce incentives to book profits overseas , it said . 
the reform is likely to result in only a 6.5 billion mark net reduction in taxpayer &apos;s burden in 1998 , far less than the government &apos;s touted figure of 30 billion marks . 
net savings in income and corporate taxes , including the solidarity surcharge , should rise to 56 billion marks in 1999 , but offsetting increases in value-added tax or petrol tax will reduce that amount to about 38 billion marks , they said . 
that would be about one percent of Germany &apos;s gross domestic product , it said . 
in view of Germany &apos;s need to reduce its budget deficit , Germany will only be able to cut social security withholdings if expenditures are also reduced , it said . 
subsidies are the most obvious target for such cuts , it said . 
but the recent demonstrations by coal miners in Bonn show how difficult it is to reduce subsidies in the face of high unemployment , it said . 
Germany &apos;s overall tax burden will remain high as long as across-the-board cuts in subsidies are not undertaken , it said . 
but the government &apos;s plan to broaden the tax base while cutting rates is a strategy that has been successfully implemented in other countries , and should result in a more equitable spreading of the tax burden , they said .
