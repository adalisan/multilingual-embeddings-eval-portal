China looks set to replace Japan as the biggest source of U.S. trade deficits and commercial frictions that Washington may find far more difficult to resolve , trade analysts say . 
the Commerce Department reported this week that for the first time , the U.S. trade deficit with China in June surpassed the shortfall with Japan . 
economists said they expect China to top the monthly list periodically in the future as the U.S. shortfall with Japan shrinks and the imbalance with China grows . 
&quot; In the long term , China is going to be our No . 
1 problem , &quot; said Norwest Corp. chief economist Sung won Sohn . 
&quot; And the problem with China is that they operate by a completely different set of rules . 
the concept of a free and open market is alien to them . 
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Mickey Kantor blamed the shortfall on closed markets and Chinese trade policies that maximize exports while limiting imports . 
Kantor said he did not expect to see a deficit this year with China much higher than the $ 34 billion shortfall last year , but that the administration was not happy with the trend . 
&quot; Because of discrimination against U.S. goods in the Chinese market , we need to make more progress , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We need to make our trade agreements work . 
the United States and China moved to the brink of a trade war earlier this year over what Washington said was Beijing &apos;s failure to enforce a 1995 agreement to protect copyrights and other intellectual property from rampant piracy . 
the dispute was resolved when China promised to beef up enforcement . 
trade analysts say they expect to see more such disputes with China as Washington presses Beijing to open markets to more U.S. good and even out the balance of trade . 
the United States , they said , has some leverage in those disputes because it represents China &apos;s largest market . 
but they also argue that Beijing &apos;s leverage is growing as the United States becomes more dependent on China as an inexpensive source of a growing variety of consumer goods including textiles , shoes , toys and electronics . 
in the long run , analysts said , it is in the interest of the United States for China to join the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) . 
Beijing wants to join the global trade system as a developing nation that would enjoy more lenient rules . 
Washington , noting the huge size of the Chinese economy , has objected and insisted China join the world body on more commercially acceptable terms . 
analysts said it is also in the long-term interest of China to join the global trading body if it wants to continue to attract foriegn investment and be assured of continued access to U.S. markets . 
&quot; In order for China to attract foreign investment at the levels it must in order to continue to grow and deal with the demands of a huge populace , it has to be a full member of the global trading system , &quot; said David Rothkopf , a former Commerce Department official . 
but Kenneth DeWoskin , a China expert at the University of Michigan , said the Chinese may have lost interest -- at least for now -- in joining the global trading forum because of the cost in terms of economic reforms that would be required in order to become a member and because they no longer fear losing U.S. 
most Favored Nation status . 
during this year &apos;s debate on China &apos;s MFN , a number of key lawmakers made clear they would like to end the annual ritual and make the status permanent next year . 
the MFN status allows Chinese goods to enter the country at the same low tariffs granted most other trading nations . 
&quot; The big benefit of joining the WTO is access to the North American Market -- and they have that -- and slighly improved access to Europe and Japan , &quot; DeWoskin said . 
&quot; But the cost is very high .
