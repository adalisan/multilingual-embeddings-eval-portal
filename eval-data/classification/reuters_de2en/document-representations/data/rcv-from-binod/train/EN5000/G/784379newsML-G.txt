prescribing antibiotics for a sore throat does little or no good , a team of British doctors reported on Friday . 
it is better to send the patient away , perhaps prescribing drugs later if the sore throat does not clear up after a week , Ian Williamson of Southampton University and colleagues found . 
the team did a survey of 11 doctor &apos;s offices in Britain , comparing three approaches -- offering standard antibiotics , giving drugs if symptoms did not clear quickly on their own , or giving no treatment at all . 
they found giving no treatment was just as effective , and drugs actually brought the patients back to the doctor &apos;s office . 
antibiotics gave &quot; only marginal benefit &quot; , they said . 
&quot; More of those initially prescribed antibiotics returned to the surgery with sore throat , &quot; they wrote in a report in the British Medical Journal . 
they recommended telling patients that a sore throat usually clears up on its own after about five days . 
there is another reason to avoid unnecessary antibiotics . 
scientists fear that over-use of antibiotics is helping drug-resistant strains develop .
