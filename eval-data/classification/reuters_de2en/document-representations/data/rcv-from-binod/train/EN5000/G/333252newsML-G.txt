Arrigo Sacchi saw Milan &apos;s slim hopes of retaining their Italian league title all but disappear on Sunday -- on the same ground where he has already lost one serie A championship . 
in an infamous match with Verona in 1990 , Sacchi , then in his first spell as Milan manager , was shown the red card together with Dutchmen Marco Van Basten and Frank Rijkaard , as his side went down to a 3-1 defeat which handed the league title to Diego Maradona &apos;s Napoli . 
on Sacchi &apos;s return to Verona on Sunday Milan crashed to another humiliating 3-1 defeat that leaves them in 10th place with little hope of catching league leaders Juventus . 
goals from Nicola Zanini , Roberto Bacci and Pierluigi Orlandini clinched Verona &apos;s third victory of the season and left Milan 11 points adrift of Juve . 
&quot; Once again Verona has been fatal for us , &quot; Sacchi said . 
to make matters worse , Juventus destroyed bottom-of-the-table Reggiana 3-1 with the contempt struggling clubs used to expect from Milan . 
Michele Padovano in particular showed no mercy for his old club scoring a fifth minute opener and setting up Vladimir Jugovic &apos;s 28th minute second with a defence-splitting pass . 
Alessio Tacchinardi added an 89th minute third before Pietro Parente claimed a late goal for the visitors . 
the result keeps Juve four points clear at the top with 36 points from 18 matches , four ahead of Sampdoria , 5-2 winners at home to Perugia . 
the prolific frontline partnership of Roberto Mancini and Vincenzo Montella helped Sampdoria recover from 2-1 down to keep Juve within their sights . 
both strikers scored twice to take veteran Mancini &apos;s career total to 138 goals - the highest among current serie A strikers - and give Montella 13 goals from 12 matches . 
Montella is now equal top goalscorer in serie A with Filippo Inzaghi whose goals have lifted Atalanta from the relegation zone to sixth . 
on Sunday , Inzaghi was on target again as his side stretched their unbeaten run to eight with a 4-1 home win over Cagliari . 
Vicenza moved into third on 30 points after completing the season &apos;s double over fiorentina with a 3-2 home win . 
Uruguayan Marcelo Otero put the home side a goal up inside the opening minute only for defender Pasquale Padalino to level the scores with a 21st minute header . 
but goals from Roberto Murgita and Gabriele Ambrosetti either side of half-time made sure of a Vicenza victory despite a late strike from Argentine Gabriel Batistuta for fiorentina . 
the win lifted Vicenza ahead of Inter who looked like falling to their second successive defeat at the San Siro after Paolo Poggi put Udinese one up in the 13th minute . 
referee Pasquale Rodomonti saved Inter &apos;s day awarding a 63rd minute penalty , duly converted by French international Youri Djorkaeff -- but the decision failed to spare him the wrath of president Massimo Moratti . 
&quot; There were 12 men against 11 out there , &quot; he said , &quot; and the 12th man for Udinese was the referee . 
Bologna , a point behind Inter after following up last week &apos;s win against Moratti &apos;s side with a 2-1 win at Lazio . 
Swede Kennet Andersson put the visitors ahead on the stroke of half-time but Italy international Pierluigi Casiraghi equalised straight after the break with a superb shot . 
seconds after Czech Pavel Nedved hit the post the home side &apos;s defence was caught square allowing Carlo Nervo to score and leave Lazio dangerously close to the relegation zone .
