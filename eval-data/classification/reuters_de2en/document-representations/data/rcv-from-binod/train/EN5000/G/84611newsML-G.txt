Colombia said on Monday it hoped the United States would help it to clear its drug-tarnished name by including it once more among those nations fighting the war on narcotics . 
last March the U.S. &quot; decertified &quot; Colombia , the world &apos;s largest exporter of cocaine , in a move that officially struck it off Washington &apos;s list of partners active in the counternarcotics battle worldwide . 
but Bogota hopes its efforts since then to step up the anti-drugs fight will win back U.S. approval . 
&quot; It &apos;s of utmost importance to Colombia to regain that status , &quot; Colombia &apos;s foreign trade minister Morris Harf Meyer told Reuters in an interview in London . 
&quot; Colombia is working bilaterally very actively with U.S. government officials in the war-against-drugs agenda . 
I think that the results are demonstrable and that gives us good hope for the recertification review that comes up on March 1st next year , &quot; he said . 
he cited President Ernesto Samper &apos;s call for tighter money laundering controls , an international accord for dealing with narco-trafficking and better coordination between intelligence organisations . 
&quot; Colombia is optimistic about regaining certification status with the US government , &quot; Harf added . 
the only Latin American country beside Chile to have an investment grade rating -- which permits international fund managers to invest there -- and one of the few never to have defaulted on its debt , Colombia suddenly found itself cut off from most U.S. aid and treated as a pariah by its erstwhile friends when Washington decertified it . 
it still risks the loss of bilateral trade privileges with its major trading partner -- about 36 percent of its total trade is with the United States . 
Harf said it was impossible to put a figure on the damage decertification has caused . 
&quot; It &apos;s more the psychological and the political impact that it has had on Colombia &apos;s image as a country , rather than the specific or quantitative effect on the balance of payments or the reserves from foreign investment , &quot; he said . 
in Britain on his way home from Geneva , where Colombia won unstinting praise from the World Trade Organisation for its economic reforms , Harf said there was a chance Washington could also revoke Colombia &apos;s preferential trade status under its Andean Trade Preference Act . 
&quot; The only eventual sanctions that could be imposed by the United States would be the lifting of unilateral preferences . 
so far nothing like that has happened and we don &apos;t foresee that that should be applied to Colombia , &quot; he said . 
but he stressed it was Washington &apos;s call and did not rule out the worst . 
should such a move go ahead , Colombia &apos;s cut flower industry -- worldwide second only to that of the Netherlands -- stands to lose either $ 40 million in profits or its profit share to competitors like Ecuador . 
Harf was heartened however by a decision by the European Union , Colombia &apos;s second largest trading partner , to extend special trade privileges to the countries of the Andean Pact -- Colombia , Bolivia , Peru , Ecuador and Venezuela -- until 2005 . 
he also said he fully supported calls by his country &apos;s exporters for a softer peso since the currency has fallen less than projected over the course of this year . 
he urged a gentle devaluation of 14 percent by June 1997 . 
&quot; It is unfair that Colombian businessmen who have worked hard to gain entry into international markets should lose that because of an artificial revaluation of the Colombian peso , &quot; he said .
