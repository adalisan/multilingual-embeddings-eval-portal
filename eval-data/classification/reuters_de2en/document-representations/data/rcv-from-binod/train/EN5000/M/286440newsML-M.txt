Belgian shares rose on Friday , helped by gains in early Wall Street trade , but dealers said most people making investment decisions were still on holiday . 
&quot; Many investors are on holiday today , the market is recovering mainly due to Wall Street , &quot; said one trader . 
another trader said &quot; the real beginning of the year will be on Monday ( January 6 ) &quot; . 
the blue-chip Bel-20 index closed up 1.01 percent , or 18.84 points , to 1,889.89 but with only a modest 1.43 billion francs volume of shares traded . 
dealers said attention would focus on cyclical stocks in coming months as support from the bond market , which helped interest-rate sensitive equities in 1996 , was not likely to be as strong this year . 
&quot; Many investors are looking for industrial stocks because they &apos;re betting that the economy will improve this year , &quot; said one trader . 
chemicals firm Tessenderlo rallied to close up 7.0 percent to 14,500 francs . 
&quot; There is a big buyer on the market today , probably an institutional investor , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; It ( Tessenderlo ) is not a cheap stock now but the stories that have come out recently , like it will expand into France , have made investors want to buy the share , &quot; said one trader . 
but trader Benoit Kint at brokerage Petercam said &quot; it &apos;s too high a price ( at 14,500 francs ) to pay at the moment , especially as nobody knows the PVC prices for 1997 &quot; . 
elsewhere cement maker CBR climbed 4.2 percent to 2,960 francs with dealers putting it down to expectations that the European market will recovery in 1997 . 
its recent increased stake in China Century cement Ltd ( CCC ) , to 30 percent from a previous five percent , has also encouraged investors to buy the stock . 
Dollar-sensitive retailer Delhaize saw the biggest volume of shares traded on the Bel-20 , closing up 2.2 percent to 1,890 francs . 
&quot; Food Lion &apos;s fourth-quarter report just published showed turnover in line with market expectations , this puts Delhaize ( Food Lion &apos;s parent company ) in a good position for 1997 , &quot; said one trader . 
Delhaize is due to release 1996 sales and provisional earnings figures next week . 
brokerage G-Securities forecast sales up 12.5 percent to 415 billion Belgian francs and earnings per share up 19 percent to 87 francs .
