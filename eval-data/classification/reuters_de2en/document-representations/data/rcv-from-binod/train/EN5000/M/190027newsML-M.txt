draws in crude oil and distillate stocks in Wednesday &apos;s oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) helped boost NYMEX futures prices during afterhours Access trade . 
&quot; crude stocks appeared to be correcting on what happened in last week &apos;s report , &quot; said Peter Keavey , trader with ING Derivatives Clearing , Inc , referring to the surprise 9.3-million-barrel build a week ago . 
API said crude stocks fell by 6.61 million barrels last week , though five million barrels of that decline was on the West Coast . 
&quot; This report &apos;s not too exciting . 
the market &apos;s in an uptrend and this shouldn &apos;t do much to change it , &quot; Keavey said . 
the API also reported a draw in distillate stocks of 827,000 barrels for the week , including a draw in PADD 1 heating oil stocks of 23,000 barrels . 
gasoline stocks were put 2.89 million barrels lower , while refinery runs fell 3.2 percentage points to 90.7 percent of capacity . 
this report seemed to correct all that . 
if you put the two together , things make more sense , &quot; said Thomas Blakeslee , a trader with Cargill investor Services . 
other market players focused on refined product stocks , which continued to hover at very low levels . 
&quot; We &apos;re one week closer to winter and distillate stocks fell , &quot; said Tom Knight , a trader with Fina Inc , noting heating oil stocks fell in the huge East Coast market as well . 
&quot; The runs falling was the biggest feature . 
we &apos;re seeing the effects of refinery problems , and that has been the driving force of the market , &quot; said Knight . 
&quot; We &apos;re seeing a lot more refinery maintenance in these numbers , &quot; Blakeslee agreed . 
low refinery output was keeping pressure on product stocks , which in turn was having a dramatic effect in Gulf Coast gasoline markets . 
&quot; It &apos;s all going to be a function of when are we going to see some barrels on offer , &quot; Knight said , referring to spot gasoline markets in Houston where prices have soared amid widespread buying by refiners and , more recently , speculators . 
Gulf traders said the 2.9-million-barrel draw on total U.S. gasoline stocks could only strengthen differentials on &quot; M4 &quot; -grade conventional unleaded , which had firmed two cents a gallon Wednesday even before release of the API weekly data . 
&quot; gasoline stocks are near their historical lows , &quot; he said , estimating &quot; outstanding &quot; implied demand of about 8.1 million barrels per day .
