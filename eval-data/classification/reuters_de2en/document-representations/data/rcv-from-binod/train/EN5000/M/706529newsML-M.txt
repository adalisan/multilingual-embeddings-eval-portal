Manila banks quoted higher bid and offer rates for Treasury bills at the secondary market in reaction to the raising of the Central Bank &apos;s closely-watched overnight rate , traders said . 
but there were no takers for the bills due to uncertainty over how long the Central Bank &apos;s rates will remain high . 
on Wednesday , the Central Bank implemented a nine percentage- point increase in its overnight borrowing rate to 24 percent after the peso was hit by speculation from Thailand &apos;s de facto devaluation . 
&quot; Everybody is trying to sell . 
we don &apos;t know how long this will last , &quot; a foreign bank dealer said . 
&quot; We don &apos;t want to fund these bills and borrow at 24 percent . 
a Reuters poll of seven financial institutions gave offers of 10.90 / 12 percent for one-month bills ; 11.50 / 12.375 percent for the six months ; and 11.80 / 12.725 percent for the one-year bills . 
the average interbank call loan rate soared to 24.3125 percent from 15.09375 percent , with the high at 26 percent . 
&quot; borrowers in the market would have to pay the price because banks only want to lend to Central Bank at 24 percent , &quot; a dealer said . 
the market , however , had 32 lenders and 19 borrowers . 
volume was at 20.2 billion pesos .
