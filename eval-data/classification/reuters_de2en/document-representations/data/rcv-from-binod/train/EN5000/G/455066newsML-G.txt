police seized eight tonnes of arms , ammunition and explosives -- including mortars -- in a raid on an arms dealer near the southern Belgian town of Mons , Belgian media said on Wednesday . 
the dealer , named as Marc Muller , was taken in for questioning but as of Wednesday morning he had been neither arrested nor charged , the media said . 
no comment was available from the Special Investigation Brigade in Mons that was coordinating the operation . 
newspapers and radio speculated about possible links to gun running , an attack on two gendarmes in Bastogne in 1995 and a series of attacks last year on security vans . 
they said French justice authorities had also expressed an interest in the weapons -- said to be old police and military surplus . 
France has suffered several attacks over the past 18 months that have been attributed to Islamic fundamentalists .
