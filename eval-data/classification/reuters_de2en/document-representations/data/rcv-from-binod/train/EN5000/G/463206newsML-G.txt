Pamela Gordon , 41-year-old daughter of one of the fathers of modern Bermuda politics , emerged on Monday as the frontrunner for premier of the British colony . 
Gordon submitted her name for the post at United Bermuda Party headquarters on Monday and would likely be the only nominee , political sources said . 
&quot; Pam seems to be the one . 
she &apos;s the only real choice , &quot; a senior cabinet minister told Reuters . 
the deadline for nominations was midnight on Monday . 
should Gordon be unanimously elected by United Bermuda Party members of parliament on Tuesday , she could be sworn in by Governor Lord Waddington within 24 hours , sources said . 
in that event , the resignation of Premier Dr. David Saul , who stunned the colony when he announced last week that he was quitting , would be moved forward . 
the resignation was to take effect on Thursday . 
twenty-one United Bermuda Party members of parliament were eligible for the $ 89,000-a-year post . 
two senior cabinet ministers regarded as serious contenders , C.V. Woolridge and Quinton Edness , announced during the weekend that they would not stand . 
Gordon , mother of two and a member of parliament for less than four years , is the daughter of E.F. Gordon , a Trinidadian-born physician who moved to the island in the 1920s . 
E.F. Gordon was one of the founders of the Bermuda Industrial Union and was a controversial member of parliament in the late 1940s and early 1950s who asserted that the white power structure had to give way to growing black political involvement . 
political observers said turmoil within the UBP had forced the party to turn away from senior members , most of whom took decisive positions in a bitter debate over the question of independence for this British colony . 
voters decisively rejected sovereignty in an August 1995 referendum . 
Saul caused further damage to unity in the UBP , which has ruled the island for 30 years , when he granted former Premier Sir John Swan permission to operate McDonald &apos;s fast-food restaurants on the island . 
the McDonald &apos;s issue has yet to be finally decided by parliament and some observers said if Gordon became premier , the fast-food row would be the first real test of her political skills .
