Greg Norman has regained the world number one ranking despite the disappointment of losing a playoff to Englishman Mark James in the Spanish Open . 
the Australian was beaten by James on the third hole of a sudden death playoff at La Moreleja after both finished on 11-under-par 277 . 
Norman , who briefly surrendered top spot in the rankings to American Tom Lehman after a record 96-week run , forced the playoff with a birdie on the final hole while James dropped a shot . 
for Norman , it meant a second shoot-out defeat on the European tour in two months , having lost out , along with Welshman Ian Woosnam , to fellow-Australian Richard Green in the Desert classic in Dubai . 
at the first extra hole on Sunday Norman was in perfect place on the fairway but pulled his shot into a bunker and could only pitch out to 10 feet . 
James drove into scrub but produced a fine second shot and comfortably made his par . 
they could not be separated at the second sudden-death hole either but on the third - the short 17th - Norman came up short with his tee shot , chipped short and ran the putt past the hole . 
James ran an approach putt up from 40 feet and tapped in for his 24th victory worldwide and his first since he took the Moroccan Open in 1995 .
