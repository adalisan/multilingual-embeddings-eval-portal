domestic demand anticipating a new bull run lifted some leading Russian shares on Wednesday though foreign investors were seen primarily on the sidelines . 
&quot; The market is deep and strong , &quot; said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell chief trader Pavel Gronbjerg . 
&quot; While the West is buying a little , selling a little , domestic demand is quite high . 
UES shares climbed to $ 0.1625 at close of the Russian Trading System from $ 0.1578 at close on Tuesday . 
Mosenergo rose to $ 1.440 from $ 1.435 . 
MFK-Moscow Partners senior trader Alexei Abdurakhimov said Russian operators were studying Western buying and snapping up shares of UES and other stocks . 
&quot; Everybody is waiting for the bull , playing for a rise so they can sell . 
he said the local operators could push up prices for another couple of days before their momentum fell and the market corrected .
