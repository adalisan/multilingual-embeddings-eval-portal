Lebanon &apos;s pro-Iranian Hizbollah said on Wednesday the mid-air crash of two Lebanon-bound Israeli military helicopters that killed 73 soldiers was an act of God . 
Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bouez said Israel should draw a lesson from the incident and realise it is time to end its occupation of south Lebanon . 
&quot; We consider what happened a success granted by God ... I will use this occassion to express big happiness and ask our people and loved ones to pray to God and thank him , &quot; Hizbollah deputy chief Sheikh Na &apos;eem Qassem told reporters of the Tuesday crash . 
the 73 Israeli soldiers killed in the crash exceeded by three the number of fatalities inflicted by Hizbollah in the past three years against Israeli soldiers occupying a border zone in south Lebanon . 
&quot; What happened was a Godly revenge for the children of Qana and for all those suffering and all those killed in Lebanon , &quot; the bearded cleric said , referring to the killing of some 100 civilians when Israeli gunners shelled the south Lebanon village of Qana during a 17-day blitz against Hizbollah last April . 
some 200 people , mainly civilians , were killed in the April blitz dubbed by Israel &quot; Operation Grapes of wrath &quot; . 
the relentless air , land and sea bombardment of south Lebanon was a failed attempt to crush Hizbollah . 
the two U.S.-made Sikorsky CH-53 transporters collided and crashed in northern Israel near the Lebanese border on Tuesday night on their way to the 15 km ( nine mile ) -wide occupation zone which Israel carved out in 1985 to repel guerrilla attacks . 
&quot; This occupation is still a hurting wound to Lebanon and a bleeding one to Israel which has cost her far more than all its wars with the Arabs , &quot; Bouez told reporters . 
Hizbollah ( Party of God ) , financed and armed by Iran , is fighting to oust some 1,000 Israeli troops and 3,000 allied local militia from the south Lebanon zone . 
it is vehemently opposed to Arab-Israeli peace talks . 
Qassem said the helicopters were carrying members of the elite military unit Egoz on their way to carry out a mission in south Lebanon . 
Israel revealed the unit in December , saying it has been secretly combatting anti-Israeli guerrillas in south Lebanon . 
&quot; This accident indicates there are premediated special operations by the Israeli enemy ... The grouping of such a number of soldiers and in this manner is an attempt for a limited military and security escalation in line with the threats the enemy has made , &quot; Qassem said . 
&quot; This confirms anew that Israel always plans for more attacks against Lebanon , against civilians , to consecrate its occupation of this country , &quot; he added .
