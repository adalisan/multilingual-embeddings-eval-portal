Britain said on Thursday it had been assured by Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana that Rwandan troops had left Zairean territory after an incursion in the Bukavu area in the east of the country . 
a foreign office spokesman said Gasana gave the assurance to Britain &apos;s Overseas Development Minister , Baroness Lynda Chalker , during a meeting in London . 
&quot; She welcomed Mr Gasana &apos;s assurance that Rwandan troops have been withdrawn , &quot; the spokesman said . 
Gasana is paying a brief visit to Britain after going to Dublin to discuss the situation in Africa &apos;s Great Lakes region with the Irish government , which currently holds the presidency of the European Union . 
on Wednesday , a senior Rwandan army officer told reporters he had sent &quot; a good-sized &quot; force of troops into Zaire after nightfall on Tuesday in retaliation for Zairean firing into Rwanda . 
Lieutenant-Colonel Firmin Kagame said mortar fire had hit the army barracks in the town of Cyangugu , adding : &quot; We were forced to retaliate . 
Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels claimed on Thursday to have taken Bukavu from the Zairean army . 
&quot; It is completely under our control , &quot; a rebel spokesman told Reuters in the town of Uvira , which was captured by rebel forces nearly a week ago .
