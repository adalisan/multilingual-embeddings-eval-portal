South African shares end firmly down after taking a late knock from weakness on Wall Street that added to local gloom about an ailing rand and bond market , dealers said . 
but dealers added that trade had been light and so the losses were probably exaggerated by thin volumes . 
shares have been keeping a wary eye on New York all week as speculation about interest rate cuts has become largely discounted in the market . 
in the light of any positive spurs a hint of nervousness has crept into play and rendered prices vulnerable to weakness elsewhere . 
with the rand at 4.6870 / 6900 on dollar from 4.6850 / 6880 late Thursday , and the benchmark R150 bond last at 14.11 percent from Thursday &apos;s close of 14.03 percent , a stock prices fall was inevitable . 
the all-share index dropped 90.5 points to 7,439.8 as the industrial index lost 117.2 points to 9,120.9 . 
total volumes touched a value of 809 million rands , but most trade was in a handful of stocks . 
on the broader market 112 issues posted gains , but a hefty 284 posted losses . 
in the golds sector shares were hit by renewed weakness in the bullion price which broke downwards through its recent range-bound trade . 
the gold index dropped 19.5 points to 1,022.4 .
