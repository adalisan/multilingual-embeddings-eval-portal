blue-chip stocks romped ahead Monday , extending a rally that began Friday when August jobs and wage data allayed the worst of Wall Street &apos;s fears about inflation and higher interest rates . 
at 1 p.m. EDT , the Dow Jones industrial average was up 39.21 points at 5,699.07 , adding to Friday &apos;s gain of 53 points . 
in the broader market , advancing issues led declines 13-8 on modest volume of 174 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
the Nasdaq composite index was up 3.97 to 1,143.36 . 
the American Stock Exchange index was off 0.42 to 559.60 . 
&quot; We &apos;re following through on Friday &apos;s rally , &quot; said Peter Cardillo , director of research at Westfalia Investments . 
&quot; The market is probably going to attempt to reach the high end of its trading range . 
in the bond market , the 30-year Treasury bond held steady and its yield was unchanged at Friday &apos;s close of 7.11 percent . 
with much of Wall Street now anticipating that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by one-quarter percentage point , rather than the half-point hike that some had feared , investors are beginning to shake off their obsession with rates , analysts said . 
&quot; It is a market being driven less by fears of interst rate increases down the road , against , I think , a backdrop of reasonable profit numbers , &quot; said Thom Carpenter , managing director and chief economist at ASB Capital Management Inc . 
the central bank &apos;s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets on Sept . 24 to weigh an interest rate increase to slow economic growth and keep inflation in check . 
analysts said the market was likely to be cautious ahead of this week &apos;s release of the consumer and producer price data for August and to keep the Dow &apos;s rally under its May 22 record closing high of 5,778.00 for at least a few sessions . 
in Friday &apos;s report , the Labour Department report said the jobless rate fell to 5.1 percent in August , and non-farm payrolls rose by 250,000 , about even with economists &apos; estimates . 
the numbers were not as strong as Wall Street had expected . 
the drop in the unemployment rate , brought the jobless rate to its lowest level since March 1989 , when it was 5 percent , the department said . 
average hourly earnings of workers rose to $ 11.87 in August from $ 11.81 in July . 
&quot; There &apos;s no doubt we &apos;re in a near-term uptrend but I think we will level off here , &quot; said Scott Bleier , chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd . &quot; We &apos;re in a low volume market and we &apos;re up near resistance . 
among individual issues , International Business machines Corp. gained 1-5 / 8 to 117-1 / 8 .

the deal was greeted less than enthusiatically by Wall Street , as Phar-Mor &apos;s stock fell 11 / 16 to 7-7 / 16 , while ShopKo was unchanged at 16-1 / 4 . 
Eastman Kodak Co. slipped 1 / 2 to 71-3 / 4 after announcing that it agreed to sell its office copier business to Britain &apos;s Danka Business Systems plc for $ 684 million cash . 
U.S.-listed shares in Danka jumped 5-3 / 16 to 35-1 / 16 on news of the deal .
