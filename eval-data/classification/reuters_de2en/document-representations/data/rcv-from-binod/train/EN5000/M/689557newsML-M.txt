cash bids for millfeeds continued to slide Thursday in reaction to ample feed supplies in most areas of the country , dealers said . 
availability of winter wheat and falling corn prices have provided livestock producers a menu of low-cost feed , dealers said . 
also , hot weather in much of the country has lessened livestock feed consumption , thus slowing feed usage . 
dealers shipping millfeeds to the Southeast said sales remain steady to the catfish industry , but were slow to poultry and hog sectors . 
Minneapolis sources reported a $ 3.00 to $ 4.00 per ton drop in prices today and in southern California prics were down $ 7.00 to $ 8.00 .
