Okinawa residents on Sunday convincingly backed a proposal to cut back the huge U.S. military presence on the Japanese island , with supporters claiming victory despite a relatively low voter turnout . 
the result failed to settle the one-year-old confrontation between Okinawa and the central government over the bases , sparked last September by the rape of a 12-year-old schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen . 
political analysts said the outcome lifted some of the pressure on Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and the Clinton administration to take immediate new steps to reduce the size of the forces , but the strength of the opposition showed that the problem must be addressed at some point . 
the Okinawa election commission said that 89.1 percent of those voting backed the initiative with just 8.5 percent against . 
the remaining ballots were spoiled . 
approval was never in doubt since only a handful of ultra-nationalists had campaigned for a &quot; no &quot; vote . 
the turnout was just 59.5 percent of the 910,000 eligible voters in the plebiscite , Japan &apos;s first provincial referendum on any issue , a lower figure than for regional elections in June . 
supporters of shutting down the U.S. bases had hoped for a turnout of 70 percent to help fortify their campaign . 
but the man leading the drive to oust all U.S. forces within 20 years , Okinawa provincial governor Masahide OTA , was euphoric over the results and had warnings for Washington and Tokyo . 
&quot; What I want to say to the rest of Japan is that you should not let weaker members of the community share a bigger responsibility , &quot; he said , adding that the results should be clear to &quot; those in the U.S. Congress who still feel like they own Okinawa . 
the islands that make up Okinawa prefecture were invaded and captured by U.S. troops in the closing months of World War Two . 
they remained under American control until 1972 . 
OTA , a renowned scholar and survivor of the epic 1945 Battle of Okinawa , is to meet Hashimoto on Tuesday . 
he refused to say whether he would continue his campaign to stop leases giving the U.S. military legal control over some of the land it occupies . 
OTA lost a Supreme Court decision last month over the land appropriation issue but has so far given no sign that he would abide by the court &apos;s decision . 
Sunday &apos;s referendum put voters a single question : did they support a curtailment of U.S. military bases and a revision of the Japan-U.S. agreement that governs the legal standing of U.S. military personnel in Japan . 
more than 75 percent of all U.S. military bases in Japan are sited on Okinawa , occupying 20 percent of the prefecture &apos;s main island and housing more than half of the 47,000 U.S. troops stationed in the country . 
Hashimoto has said the Okinawa vote is a major factor in his expected decision to dissolve parliament and call early elections in October , although he need not do so until July . 
&quot; The result of the referendum means that we are being scolded for having done nothing to lessen Okinawa &apos;s burden , &quot; he said . 
senior Defence and Foreign Ministry officials from Japan and the United States are to meet on September 19 in Washington to discuss details of a plan to reduce the bases on Okinawa by 20 percent , first announced by Hashimoto and U.S. President Bill Clinton last April . 
Okinawa had opposed the Hashimoto-Clinton plan because of relocation conditions .
