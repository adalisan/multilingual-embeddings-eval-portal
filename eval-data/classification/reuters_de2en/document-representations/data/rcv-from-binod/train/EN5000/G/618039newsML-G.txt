intense jockeying broke out on the French right on Tuesday in a race to succeed humiliated Prime Minister Alain Juppe as President Jacques Chirac prepared a plan to lure back angry voters in Sunday &apos;s parliamentary runoff vote . 
Chirac was looking at Philippe Seguin , popular speaker of the outgoing National Assembly , and Edouard Balladur , an urbane former premier , as candidates to succeed Juppe if the right won the runoff , the daily Le Monde said in an unsourced report . 
it was also possible that Chirac could choose to appoint a premier from the business sector , the newspaper said . 
should the left claim victory on Sunday , however , Chirac would have to name -- and share power with -- Socialist leader Lionel Jospin . 
Juppe announced on Monday that he would step down as premier , taking the blame for the ruling coalition &apos;s disastrous showing in Sunday &apos;s first round of the snap assembly election in which it was outscored by the combined left . 
Juppe , stunned by the left-wing upset , said his departure would give Chirac new last-minute arguments to convince voters to return the conservatives to power . 
the left &apos;s surprise first-round victory unsettled bond markets across Europe due to worries over the future of European monetary union , although Socialist former European Commission chief Jacques Delors said the left would make EMU its priority . 
French shares traded higher , however , after Monday &apos;s sharp declines . 
Chirac , described by Juppe as &quot; the only man able to embody renewal &quot; , was scheduled to deliver a live television address at eight p.m. ( 1800 GMT ) on Tuesday , his third intervention in the campaign to try to save his majority . 
he was not expected to divulge his choice for next prime minister but rather to outline new priorities should the government win a new lease on life . 
Le Monde said he would emphasise the need for economic growth through a sharp reduction in payroll taxes , and for less economic regulation though with no weakening of the social safety net -- the same priorities he has espoused throughout the long campaign . 
analysts said only a dramatic gesture could now succeed in swaying enough votes to his side to avert a leftist triumph . 
&quot; Everything will depend on this evening , &quot; said one analyst , who said Chirac must choose between the free-market liberalism embodied by sacked finance minister Alain Madelin and the populism embodied by Seguin , &quot; now that it is clear that a cautious middle path does not work &quot; . 
&quot; In 24 hours , the president must invent another policy . 
mission impossible , &quot; the centre-left daily Liberation wrote . 
&quot; The sacrifice of Alain Juppe comes too late , as the symbol of an enormous mess , &quot; Liberation editorialist Serge July wrote . 
Chirac could also lay his own job on the line , threatening to resign if voters disavow him , as his mentor , president Charles de Gaulle , did regularly during his time in office . 
however , the last time de Gaulle tried the ploy was in 1969 , in a referendum over decentralisation . 
he lost and left office the next morning . 
Balladur affirmed his availability for Juppe &apos;s job with a lengthy interview in Le Monde in which he said France had to invent its own style of economic liberalism rather than turn to &quot; Anglo-Saxon models &quot; . 
he said voters had shown in the first-round ballot that they wanted a more dynamic society in order to bring down France &apos;s record 12.8 percent unemployment but that they were also attached to a strong French identity . 
Seguin , a jovial and rotund politician who led the unsuccessful campaign against ratification of the Maastricht treaty on greater European integration in a 1992 referendum , has consistently topped the list of favourite potential rightist prime ministers in voter surveys . 
Seguin , holed up at his home in the eastern city of Epinal , told France 2 television : &quot; Whether it &apos;s a big victory or a small victory , or no victory at all , it will be very difficult for whoever heads the government .
