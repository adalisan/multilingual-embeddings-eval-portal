Canada has found some support among its major trade partners to open up international trade in environmental products , senior Canadian trade officials said on Thursday . 
&quot; ( Canadian Trade Minister Art ) Eggleton raised the idea that we should be looking at liberalizing trade in the near term in environmental products and services , &quot; an official , who asked not to be identified , said after the morning session of trade talks among four major trading partners . 
&quot; There was a pretty good discussion of this and some support from some of the other ( trade delegations ) . 
Eggleton is meeting with his counterparts from Japan , the United States and the European Union in a two-day so-called Quad meeting to advance the international free trade agenda . 
officials said Canada plan to push freer trade in environmental products next week too , when trade ministers from the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum meet in Montreal as a precursor to a leaders &apos; meeting in Vancouver in November . 
&quot; There &apos;s a lot of interest among developing countries in this , &quot; the official said . 
the Quad leaders have been hunting for a sector -- such as environmental products -- where the likelihood of strong international support is high . 
they hope to continue the free- trade momentum started by the Information Technology Agreement forged last December at the World Trade Organization &apos;s trade ministers &apos; meeting in Singapore . 
the deal aims to eliminate tariffs on a variety of information technology products by the year 2000 . 
the trade ministers are considering making participation in the Information Technology Agreement a condition to joining the World Trade Organization , officials said . 
&quot; There was also discussion on the importance of encouraging countries which are acceeding to the World Trade Organization to adopt the Information Technology Agreement as part of their joining the organization , &quot; an official said . 
China &apos;s bid to join the WTO would likely come up in later discussions of the Quad , officials said . 
the bid could give rise to some lively banter if the members disagreed on how much trade liberalization China must offer to join . 
the trade chiefs also discussed expanding the ITA , a senior U.S. official said . 
&quot; A lot of us have had a number of indications of sepcific areas of interest in terms of product expansion and also looking at other barriers , whether they &apos;re non-tariff barriers or standards , &quot; the official told reporters .
