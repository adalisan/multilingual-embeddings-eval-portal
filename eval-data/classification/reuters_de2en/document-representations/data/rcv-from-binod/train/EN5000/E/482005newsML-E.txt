new orders received by U.S. factories increased for a second straight month in February , the Commerce Department said on Wednesday , adding to evidence of strong first-quarter economic activity . 
orders rose 0.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 325.9 billion following a 2.5 percent surge in January . 
the February pickup would have been stronger except for a downturn in transportation orders , but it still fit with other recent signs of expanding manufacturing activity . 
shipments of finished products , order backlogs and inventories of goods all were higher in February than in January as the tempo of factory business increased . 
orders for all types of durable goods , like refrigerators and manufacturing machinery that are intended to last three years or more , grew by 1.5 percent in February to $ 177.9 billion after a 3.8 percent rise in January . 
non-durable goods like food and paper products posted a 0.1 percent increase following a 0.9 percent rise in January . 
among durable goods , the biggest gain in February orders was for electronic and electrical equipment , up 7.1 percent to $ 30.4 billion after a 17.8 percent jump in January . 
but orders for transportation goods -- the largest single category in terms of value -- fell in February by 4.1 percent to $ 40.6 billion after a 1.5 percent rise in January . 
orders were weaker for new cars , airplanes and other goods aside from railroad equipment . 
excluding transportation , factory orders rose in February by 1.6 percent after a 2.6 percent increase in January . 
there are abundant recent signs of robust manufacturing activity that some analysts say may presage an acceleration in overall economic growth this spring . 
on Tuesday , the National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of activity rose to 55.0 in March -- its highest level in two years -- from 53.1 in February as hiring , production and new orders strengthened . 
in addition , Commerce said that new construction spending surged at its strongest rate in nearly a year during February , aided by warm weather that made it easier to start new projects . 
Federal Reserve Governor Laurence Meyer , in an interview with the Washington Post on Wednesday , said the economy was very strong . 
but he declined to comment directly on what the central bank might do at its next policy-setting session on May 20 . 
the Fed decided last week to bump up short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point , citing concern about the potential for inflation arising from strong demand . 
&quot; The economy is really strong , &quot; Meyer said . 
&quot; This is not a fluke . 
the factory orders report showed that shipments , taken as a measure of current demand for factory goods , increased 0.9 percent in February to $ 321.5 billion after a 1 percent January rise . 
shipments have grown in seven of the past eight months . 
order backlogs were up 0.9 percent in both January and February , an indication that factories have business ahead to keep production lines going . 
defence contractors &apos; orders , which are subject to wide monthly swings , fell 2.6 percent to $ 6 billion following a 23 percent drop in January . 
orders for non-defence capital goods , a measure of business expansion plans , rose 3.5 percent to $ 47.4 billion in February after gaining 4.4 percent in January . 
industrial machinery ordfers picked up by 1.9 percent to $ 33.1 billion after a gain of 0.9 percent in January . 
inventories of manufactured products grew by 0.4 percent to $ 441.8 billion in February after a 0.5 percent January rise . 
inventories are considered relatively lean , which analysts say provides more reason for manufacturers to maintain strong levels of production to build up stocks .
