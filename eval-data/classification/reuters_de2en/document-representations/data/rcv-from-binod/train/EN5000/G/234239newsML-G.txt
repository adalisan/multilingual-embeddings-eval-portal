a Hawaiian court &apos;s decision to legalize gay marriage in that state has reignited the national debate on the subject , with those for and against such unions warning on Wednesday of a tough fight ahead . 
as both sides formed battle lines after Tuesday &apos;s historic ruling by Hawaiian Judge Kevin Chang , which made the Pacific island state the first to recognize same-sex marriages , gay and lesbian activists were quick to caution against euphoria . 
&quot; This decision was historic and thrilling but it is not the end of the case or the struggle , &quot; Evan Wolfson of the New York-based Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund said . 
&quot; It is the beginning of the end for sex discrimination in marriage but there likely will be an appeal and in the meantime we still face backlash battles in several states . 
Wolfson and Honolulu attorney Dan Foley represented the three couples , two of them lesbian , whose lawsuit against the state of Hawaii resulted in Tuesday &apos;s ruling . 
the Rev. 
Louis Sheldon , head of Traditional Values , a coalition of 31,000 churches nationwide , said the Hawaii ruling &quot; marks the beginning of a national debate which will decide the central moral issue of our civilization -- the fate of the institution of marriage . 
he said the ruling was disappointing , but added , &quot; This is only the beginning . 
no reasonable American will support this extreme effort to sanctify and sanction something which is sinful and unnatural . 
nowhere is the battle over gay and lesbian marriages likely to be fought harder than in California , where state Sen. Pete Knight vowed on Wednesday to reintroduce a bill in the state legislature that would block recognition of same-sex couples married in Hawaii . 
&quot; If we don &apos;t act soon , our public policy will be undermined when same-sex partners bring Hawaii marriage licences back to this state and demand that their relationships be recognized as somehow equal to traditional marriage , &quot; the Republican said . 
Knight &apos;s bill was passed by the state Assembly last year but failed in the Senate . 
Ellen McCormick of LIFE , a gay and lesbian activist organization based in Sacramento , California , said there could be a case before state courts as early as 1998 . 
it would not happen before then , she said , because the Hawaii court ruling will be appealed to that state &apos;s Supreme Court , which could delay the issuing of marriage licences for about a year . 
&quot; In order to have a case in California we need a couple to be married in Hawaii ... and then to return to California and ask the state to recognize their marriage , &quot; McCormick said . 
but &quot; the deck is stacked in our favor . 
the constitutional arguments are on our side , &quot; she said , pointing out that California already has a law saying the state cannot discriminate against gays and lesbians . 
in addition , while California law defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman , it also says the state will recognize marriages performed in other states . 
Taylor Flynn , an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of southern California specializing in gay and lesbian rights , said she was confident Knight &apos;s bill would be defeated again but cautioned that &quot; things will not be settled for years to come . 
in the long run , she said , &quot; more people will see lots of happy ( homosexual ) couples who have been married in Hawaii and are raising well-balanced children . 
eventually the fear will dissipate . 
according to Lambda , 16 states have passed anti-same-sex marriage bills while in 20 more such legislation has failed . 
also , President Bill Clinton signed the &quot; Defense of Marriage &quot; act in September denying federal benefits to same-sex married couples and allowing states to ignore those unions .
