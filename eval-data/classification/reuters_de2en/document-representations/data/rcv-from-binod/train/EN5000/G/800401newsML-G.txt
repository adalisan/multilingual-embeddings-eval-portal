Israel on Thursday partly demolished five Palestinian homes in the West Bank it said were built illegally , witnesses and the army said . 
witnesses said Israeli bulldozers under army guard levelled five annexes to homes in a compound owned by one extended family in the village of Nabi Samuel near Jerusalem . 
Israel demolished nine homes in Arab East Jerusalem and the West Bank on Wednesday . 
&quot; God might not get you now but you &apos;re going to have your day later , &quot; one Palestinian woman screamed at troops . 
Peter Lerner , spokesman for the Israeli military &apos;s Civil Administration in the West Bank and Gaza , said the army demolished extensions to homes in Nabi Samuel and a house in Bir Naballah near PLO-ruled Ramallah because they were built without permits . 
&quot; The destructions went through all the procedures according to law , &quot; Lerner said . 
he said the army had also removed a group of Palestinian Bedouin who had encamped on state land near the West Bank Jewish settlement of Maaleh Adumim . 
in Nabi Samuel , members of the Barakat family cursed troops as workers reduced parts of their homes to rubble . 
&quot; I left you and I left your religion and I left my family because what you are doing is wrong , it &apos;s wrong , &quot; Chana Barakat , an Israeli woman who married into the Barakat family and converted to Islam , shouted at troops . 
Palestinians say they are forced to build illegally because Israel will not give them permits . 
Palestinian rights groups have accused Israel of exploiting last month &apos;s suicide bombing in an Israeli market as a cover for the demolitions . 
&quot; This is all part of the vengeance for the bombing , &quot; human rights lawyer Linda Breyer told Reuters . 
&quot; I think it &apos;s completely barbaric and has nothing to do with law . 
it is continuing colonisation of the territories . 
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of a future state . 
Israel , which captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war , calls the entire city its undivided , eternal capital .
