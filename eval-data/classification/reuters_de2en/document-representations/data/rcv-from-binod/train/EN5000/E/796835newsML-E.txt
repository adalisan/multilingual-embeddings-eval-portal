early data show economic activity is inching up towards trend growth in the third U.S. district in the third quarter after a slack second quarter , an official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said . 
&quot; Early indicators in the third quarter suggest the economy is basically picking up from the second quarter but not as strong as the first , &quot; Ted Crone , a vice president at the Philadelphia Fed told Reuters on Wednesday . 
&quot; We would think that the economy would be back on trend growth in the third quarter , &quot; added Crone , who also heads the Philadelphia Fed regional economics department . 
Crone said employment for the district , which encompasses Delaware , the eastern portion of Pennsylvania and the southern portion of New Jersey , is expected to grow soberly as opposed to the breakneck pace seen in the first quarter . 
he said job growth is expected to expand by an annualized 1.0 percent in Pennsylvania , a little over 1.0 percent in New Jersey and around 2.0 percent in Delaware . 
&quot; That &apos;s basically what we &apos;re looking at for trend growth on an annual rate , &quot; Crone said . 
he said the rebound in activity towards trend growth has been led by stronger consumption , a healthy manufacturing sector and some areas in the service industry , mainly tourism . 
Crone said consumers , seen by many as the big question mark hovering on the economic scenario , have been reaching into their pockets and rolling out their dollar bills more often in the early part of the third quarter than they did earlier . 
&quot; Most of the consumer activity looks pretty good for the third quarter . 
Auto sales are a little iffy , but we &apos;re still only half-way through the third quarter , &quot; Crone said . 
&quot; The consumer will spend more in the third quarter than in the second . 
some of the service industries will do well ... ( and ) manufacturing will also hold its own , &quot; he added . 
Crone also said summer spending , mainly on tourism-related issues , has been strong and adding up to the region &apos;s economic expansion in the third quarter . 
despite brisk job creation and rising consumption , the Philadelphia Fed economist said inflation has remained benign while wage pressures have been surprisingly tame . 
&quot; We are a little bit surprised that the wage pressures haven &apos;t been greater given the tightness of the Labor market , &quot; Crone said . 
asked whether rising productivity was responsible for the friendly economic momentum , Crone said , &quot; It could be . 
&quot; But he stressed that productivity has been an area of the economy where it has been difficult to find reliable gauges . 
Crone declined to discuss the current level of interest rates or the future of the Federal Reserve &apos;s monetary policy . 
the Fed &apos;s policy setting committee will meet next on August 19 to deliberate on interest rates . 
the Fed last changed policy on March 25 , when it hiked the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to the current 5.50 percent . 
the central bank stood pat in the May and July meetings of its policy-setting body , the Federal Open Market Committee . 
a large majority of pundits and Fed watchers on Wall Street expect the Fed to keep monetary policy unchanged during its next meeting in August .
