the dollar closed higher in New York Monday , though off its best levels reached in Asian trading , as Group of Seven finance ministers left room for further dollar gains , currency dealers said . 
the dollar climbed to a 37-month peak against the German mark and near its 55-month high against the Japanese yen after the outcome of Sunday &apos;s meeting between G7 officials in Washington was more lenient than traders had anticipated . 
&quot; If anything , the market was a little surprised of the lack of forcefulness in the G7 comments , &quot; said Dennis Pettit , foreign exchange trading manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think the market perceives any heightened risk of central bank intervention today as opposed to Friday . 
traders said neither the official statement after the G7 gathering nor comments by officials gave any hint that they plan to step in to the foreign exchange markets to curb the dollar &apos;s rise , a measure the United States has not taken since August 1995 . 
but U.S officials did publicly pressure Japan to prevent a &quot; significant increase &quot; in its trade surplus with the rest of the world . 
further weakening of the yen could widen the nation &apos;s trade surplus by making Japanese exports more attractive . 
&quot; The communique suggested it is a case of watching the pot , but it &apos;s not boiling yet , &quot; said Ron Leven , currency strategist at J.P. Morgan . 
&quot; There are references to not wanting trade to become a problem , without saying it is a problem , &quot; he added . 
in the statement , finance ministers said major currency misalignments had been corrected and excessive volatility and deviations from fundamentals were undesirable . 
shortly after the dollar reached its highs in Asia , dealers began to cash in profits . 
the dollar stood at 1.7325 German marks in late New York trading , below its high of 1.7389 but above 1.7275 late in New York on Friday . 
the dollar rose to 126.89 yen , below its high for the day of 127.08 , but above 126.25 at Friday &apos;s close . 
the dollar &apos;s move against the mark was compounded by investors selling the British pound and buying marks ahead of Thursday &apos;s general election in Britain , which polls predict will bring 18 years of Conservative Party rule to an end in favour of Tony Blair &apos;s Labour Party . 
in other trading , the dollar rose against its Canadian counterpart after Canada &apos;s Prime Minister Jean Chretien on Sunday called a June 2 general election , 17 months before the required date . 
Chretien has governed for 3-1 / 2 years but has a broad lead in the polls over a badly split opposition . 
the pound inched up to $ 1.6247 from $ 1.6235 . 
the dollar rose to 1.4735 Swiss francs from 1.4690 .
