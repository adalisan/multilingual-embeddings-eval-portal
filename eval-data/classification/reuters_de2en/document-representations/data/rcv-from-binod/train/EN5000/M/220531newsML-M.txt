Sweden &apos;s sharemarket closed lower on Wednesday , weighed down by losses on Wall Street and depressed by the banking sector . 
the Stockholm general index slipped 1.20 percent to close at 2227.17 in fairly choppy trade . 
turnover was relatively quiet with shares worth 3.1 billion crowns changing hands . 
brokers said the U.S. was dictating the market &apos;s direction . 
&quot; If the U.S. doesn &apos;t fall too far tonight we will probably not see much more downward movement here tomororw , &quot; one broker said . 
&quot; There is no real selling pressure here but it is rather that the buyers are staying away . 
the banking sector continued to come under pressure in the wake of the proposed merger between insurer Skandia and mortgage bank Stadshypotek which has been opposed by the government . 
the sector index fell 1.63 percent . 
Skandia closed 2.5 lower at 186.5 crowns and Stadshypotek lost one to 194 crowns . 
telecoms giant Ericsson also weighed down the market , dropping 4.5 crowns to close at 199.5 crowns . 
fellow bluechip drugs major Astra dipped on to 314.5 crowns .
