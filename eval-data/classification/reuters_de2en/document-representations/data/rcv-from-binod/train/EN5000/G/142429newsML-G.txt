drug trafficking is the most serious crime threatening Portuguese society and authorities are stepping up vigilance of the coastline as a top priority , Interior Minister Alberto Costa said on Wednesday . 
&quot; We have reinforced cooperation between various police organisations to fight drug trafficking , which is without doubt the most threatening crime to us in Portugal , &quot; Costa told a conference on international crime in Lisbon . 
&quot; This concern has forced us to make our present priority a programme to increase vigilance of the coastline in order to reduce its vulnerability to penetration by drugs . 
Portugal &apos;s under-funded police force says it is struggling to keep the pressure on international drug gangs , who run heroin , cocaine and cannabis into Portugal by land and sea . 
some is consumed domestically and the rest exported to Europe , mainly the Netherlands and Spain . 
last week Portuguese police seized about 10 kg ( 22 pounds ) of cocaine stashed inside the packaging of about 1,000 imported compact discs and arrested two French nationals .
