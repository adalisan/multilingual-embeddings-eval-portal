at least 24 people , 19 of them soldiers , were killed and four injured when a bus plunged into a valley in northern Pakistan , a bus company official said on Sunday . 
Muhammad Naseem , transport manager of the Gilgit-based Northern Areas Transport Corporation , told Reuters 28 people had been aboard the bus when it crashed on Saturday . 
he said rescuers had recovered 21 bodies from the wreckage of the bus , which had hurtled 300 feet ( 100 metres ) from the twisting road into a dry ravine . 
three bodies remained trapped under the wreckage . 
&quot; It was either brake failure or the driver fell asleep because there were no tyre marks on the road , &quot; Naseem said . 
all the soldiers had been on their way from the northeastern town of Skardu to Rawalpindi , near Islamabad , a journey of about 290 km ( 181 miles ) . 
they had just been paid and were going on leave , Naseem added .
