Britain and the United States are studying a proposal to give an estimated six tons of gold confiscated from the Nazis and held in London and New York banks to Holocaust survivors , a Jewish group said on Thursday . 
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind has written to the World Jewish Congress ( WJC ) saying he would reach a decision soon after a study of the legal ramifications is completed , a WJC spokesman said . 
he added that a decision was also expected shortly from President Bill Clinton whom he described as &quot; our major ally &quot; in the fight to restore assets confiscated from Holocaust victims . 
two tons of the gold are in the underground vaults of the New York Federal Reserve Bank and an additional four tons are at the Bank of England in London . 
the gold , worth an estimated $ 75 million at current prices , is all that is left of Nazi gold confiscated by the allies at the end of the Second World War . 
the gold was placed in the two banks by the Tripartite Gold Commission , which was set up by Britain , France and the United States to return gold looted by the Nazis from the countries they occupied . 
about $ 2.2 billion in gold has been given to more than 10 countries but no gold has been returned to individuals , a WJC spokesman said . 
the WJC and several other Jewish groups are calling for the return of the gold to Holocaust victims or their survivors . 
the Tripartite Commission confirmed on Wednesday that two metric tons of gold worth $ 24.9 million was sitting in the New York Federal Reserve 51 years after the end of the war .
