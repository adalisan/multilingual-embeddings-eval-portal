a U.N. envoy was due to meet officials from Tajikistan &apos;s government and the Tajik opposition in Tehran on Wednesday to prepare for peace talks in Moscow , the official Iranian news agency IRNA said . 
it said the U.N. &apos; s Gerd Merrem arrived in Tehran on Tuesday for a week-long visit to prepare for renewed peace talks in Moscow later this month between Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov and opposition leader Sayid Abdullo Nuri . 
it said Merrem will &quot; meet representatives of the Tajik government and the opposition on Wednesday to draft a joint statement to be issued after holding the Moscow meeting &quot; . 
Merrem is trying to rescue a shaky United Nations-sponsored ceasefire which was reconfirmed at peace talks in July . 
the ceasefire was first signed in September 1994 but both sides have continued to accuse each other of violations and fighting has broken out in regions east of the capital Dushanbe . 
the Tajik rebels are loyal to Islamic opposition leaders driven into exile in Afghanistan and Iran after losing a clan-based civil war which broke out soon after independence from the Soviet Union .
