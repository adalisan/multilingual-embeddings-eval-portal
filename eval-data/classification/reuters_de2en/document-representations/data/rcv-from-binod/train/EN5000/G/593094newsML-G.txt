Denmark &apos;s foreign minister said on Saturday that a Danish mother had been foolish to leave her baby daughter outside a New York restaurant , but U.S. authorities who jailed her for two days had over-reacted . 
Danish newspapers ran front-page pictures of actress Annette Sorensen and 14-month-old daughter Liv after a New York City judge on Friday dropped criminal charges against the mother . 
&quot; We won , &quot; crowed rival tabloid B.T. 
Sorensen was jailed for two days last weekend and her baby put into foster care for four days . 
she had left Liv parked in a stroller outside a restaurant while she and the child &apos;s American father were having a drink and watching her through the window . 
&quot; It was rash of the mother to leave her child in an American city . 
it is not clever but is perhaps excusable because she was not really aware of the danger , &quot; Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen told B.T. 
&quot; But the American authorities over-reacted because this was not a case of a mother who could be accused of neglecting her child , it &apos;s completely out of proportion , &quot; he added . 
Ekstrabladet quoted Sorensen , 30 , as saying that she bore no animosity over the affair . 
&quot; I &apos;m not quite myself again yet , but I am not bitter toward the United States ( although ) I honestly can &apos;t say if I will ever come back again , &quot; she told the paper , holding Liv in her arms , at a champagne celebration in New York &apos;s Danish seamen &apos;s Church . 
under terms of the deal reached before Judge Michael Gross by her attorney , the Manhattan District Attorney and the Danish Consulate , the criminal charges of endangering the welfare of a child were dismissed and the case will be closed for good in six months . 
&quot; It is our belief that this was a clash of cultures and a lack of understanding , &quot; her attorney Todd Barnet said . 
the mother &apos;s lawyers said that she did not think twice about leaving the child outside the restaurant because it was common practice in Copenhagen . 
Sorensen still must appear in Family Court on Wednesday but B.T. 
quoted a lawyer for the Danish Consulate in New York , Peter Hessellund-Jensen , as saying that he foresaw no problems . 
&quot; I am convinced that the hearing is only a formality , &quot; he said . 
Sorensen &apos;s attorney says she has a plane ticket to leave the United States on May 27 . 
she had been in the country less than 48 hours when her daughter was taken from her .
