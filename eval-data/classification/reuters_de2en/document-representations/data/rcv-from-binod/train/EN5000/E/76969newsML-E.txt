the Papua New Guinea government has warned the World Bank that it is prepared to forego the remainder of the bank &apos;s US $ 345 million aid programme if conditions attached to the funding prove too onerous . 
outlining the government &apos;s budget agenda for calendar 1997 , Finance Minister Chris Haiveta told parliament in Port Moresby on Tuesday night the government could survive without the second tranche of the loans-for-reform programme . 
the programme is coordinated by the World Bank and comprises funding from the bank , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , Japan and Australia . 
the aid , of which US $ 200 million has already been paid , is conditional on economic reform . 
&quot; The IMF and the World Bank are invited to join and assist us . 
we have done all we could to satisfy their requirements . 
I am calling on them to cooperate with us , &quot; Haiveta said . 
&quot; If they do , we will be very pleased and honoured but they must appreciate that we will not compromise our rights as a sovereign independent nation and people , &quot; he said . 
&quot; If they don &apos;t , we will got it alone , &quot; he said . 
world Bank officials were in Port Moresby in recent days for more talks on the programme , but left without a resolution . 
the aid has been held up mainly by the bank &apos;s concern over a recent government move to bring the independent National Forest Authority under the forest minister &apos;s control . 
some experts believe logging in Papua New Guinea is being carried out at twice the sustainable rate . 
a spokesman for Haiveta told Reuters by telephone that the prospects for an agreement with the bank was slim and that the bank must make the next move . 
&quot; They will breach their own agreement if they don &apos;t come good ( with the second tranche ) , &quot; the spokesman said . 
asked about the prospects of agreement , he added : &quot; Not good , in the sense that both sides are not giving any ground . 
we would like them to respect our independence . 
this is the message we are trying to get across to them .
