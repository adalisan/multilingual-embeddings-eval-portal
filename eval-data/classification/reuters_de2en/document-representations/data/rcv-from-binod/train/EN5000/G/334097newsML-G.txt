German prosecutors said on Monday they were still investigating tennis star Steffi Graf , whose father was found guilty last week of evading millions of marks ( dollars ) in tax on her earnings . 
Mannheim prosecutor Hubert Jobski , whose office has been in charge of the tax probe , told Reuters : &quot; The investigations into Steffi Graf are still going on . 
we are in charge of the case and will conclude it as soon as we can . 
the judge who sentenced Graf &apos;s father on six counts of actual and attempted tax evasion said there was no indication that Steffi , whose signature was on the tax returns , had actively participated in the crime . 
he recommended that the continuing investigation against her should be dropped . 
but Jobski said the judge &apos;s recommendation had no bearing on the probe , adding : &quot; I wouldnt like to speculate about the outcome of the investigation . 
Steffi Graf , the world number one whose career earnings are estimated at more than $ 61 million , has told tax investigators she entrusted her financial affairs to her father from an early age and had little idea how her money was managed . 
Jobski said even if her father said he had taken this burden off her shoulders , by law she was still responsible for her own tax declarations . 
the prosecutor has in the past said the suspicions against Steffi are less serious than those against her father , and indicated he will study the outcome of Peter Graf &apos;s trial before deciding how to proceed with the case against Steffi . 
Peter Graf was sentenced last Friday to three years and nine months in jail for evading 12 million marks of tax on his daughter &apos;s earnings -- three years less than the prosecution had asked for . 
former family tax adviser Joachim Eckardt received two years and nine months for complicity . 
Graf &apos;s celebrity lawyer Franz Salditt said one of the most important aspects of the judgment for Peter Graf and his team was the fact that judge Joachim Plass called for the investigation against Steffi to be closed . 
Graf herself has deposited around 20 million marks with authorities to cover her possible tax debt . 
the seven-times Wimbledon champion , who suffered a surprise fourth round defeat in the Australian Open this month , is now in Tokyo where she is due to play in a tournament starting on Tuesday .
