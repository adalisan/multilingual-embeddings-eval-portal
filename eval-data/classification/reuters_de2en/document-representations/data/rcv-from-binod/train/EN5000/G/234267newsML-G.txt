a New Hampshire man has been charged with statutory rape after admitting on a national television talk show that he had sex with a minor , authorities said Wednesday . 
police arrested Carl Carlson Tuesday after viewing a tape of the &quot; The Sally Jesse Raphael Show &quot; during which he said he fathered a child with a 14-year-old girl . 
the age of consent in New Hampshire is 16 . 
&quot; The girl &apos;s mother had contacted the show with the suggestion she and girl be guests . 
&quot; I thought it would knock some sense into her , &quot; the mother told Foster &apos;s Daily Democrat newspaper . 
the woman admitted she had second thoughts during the show because the studio audience booed as the couple walked on stage . 
police said they investigated the case when the child was born four months ago but felt they did not have enough evidence for an arrest until the girl &apos;s mother informed them about the television appearance . 
Carlson faces up to seven years in prison if convicted . 
a reporter covering Wednesday &apos;s arraignment said Carlson &apos;s attorney advised him sternly not to discuss the case with the media .
