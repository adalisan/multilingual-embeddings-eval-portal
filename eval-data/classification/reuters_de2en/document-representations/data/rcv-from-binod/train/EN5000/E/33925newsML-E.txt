Greece &apos;s GDP will grow by about 3.3 percent in 1997 , faster that the official projection of 3.0 percent , provided construction of large infrastructure projects is accelerated , a high-level official at the national economy ministry told Reuters . 
&quot; GDP growth will exceed the official projection of 3.0 percent in 1997 and be around 3.3 percent provided construction of large public works is speeded up , &quot; Yannis Sidiropoulos , head of the directorate general for economic policy at the national economy ministry told Reuters . 
&quot; Some economic indicators such as building permits look very promising in the first half of this year and it is very likely that this momentum will be carried on to 1997 , &quot; he said . 
Greece &apos;s convergence plan to align its economy with the rest of the European Union forecasts a GDP growth of 2.6 percent in 1997 and 1.7 percent in 1996 . 
national Economy Minister Yannos Papandoniou said recently that GDP growth will reach 2.6 percent in 1996 but Sidiropoulos who is responsible for GDP calculations at the ministry does not preclude an upward revision of this figure to 2.7 percent in later estimates . 
final GDP figures are available with a four year lag but this is to be shortened to about a year or less in 1998 when the National Statistics Service completes the revision of past GDPs under the new ESA method .
