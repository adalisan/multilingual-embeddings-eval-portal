it has long been known that men and women experience pain differently ; now comes the first evidence that they may get pain relief in different ways as well . 
researchers have found that a class of painkillers known as kappa-opioids worked better and longer in women than in men after wisdom teeth extraction . 
but the drugs are prescribed less often than other painkillers because they are considered less effective , partly because men were overrepresented in tests of the drugs , according to Dr. Jon Levine who led the research team at the University of California at San Francisco . 
Levine &apos;s findings , which could eventually have implications for treating the pain of Labor , cancer , nerve injuries and other conditions , appear in the November edition of the journal Nature Medicine . 
&quot; Our studies provide evidence that biologically , men and women do not obtain pain relief in the same way . 
it may be that the brain circuitry regulating pain relief differs between the sexes , &quot; said Levine . 
Levine &apos;s team studied 48 men and women for three hours after surgery to remove impacted wisdom teeth . 
they found that kappa-opioids gave women greater , and longer-lasting relief than men got from those drugs . 
Kappa-opioids are prescribed less often than a family of painkillers called mu-opioids , which include morphine . 
&quot; Kappa-opioid agents appear to be of little clinical benefit for males but produce very satisfactory analgesia ( painkilling ) for females , &quot; Levine said . 
much more research needs to be done before doctors contemplate changing prescription patterns for men and women . 
Levine &apos;s study was small , involving healthy subjects in their 20s . 
others factors would need to be examined in larger scale research . 
still , the unusual study &quot; is a message , a very strong message , to pursue this research , &quot; said Karen Berkley , a neuroscientist at Florida State University who wrote a commentary on the research in the same journal . 
Berkley in a telephone interview said including more women in future clinical trials might yield better painkillers for men and women , since such studies might provide more insight into the basic mechanisms of pain . 
&quot; This is a positive opportunity to mine , &quot; she said . 
&quot; It is to everybody &apos;s advantage ... for any drug to be tested in all populations . 
it gives us more of a chance to develop more and better drugs . 
although there has been a lot of research done on the differences in pain felt by men and women , Levine said he has not found any other studies comparing how painkillers work in the sexes . 
painkillers work by attaching to certain sites , known as receptors , on nerve cells . 
that prevents the nerve cell from sending the signal for pain . 
Kappa and mu-opioids attach to different receptors . 
it is not yet known whether hormones explain the differences between men and women or if other factors are at work .
