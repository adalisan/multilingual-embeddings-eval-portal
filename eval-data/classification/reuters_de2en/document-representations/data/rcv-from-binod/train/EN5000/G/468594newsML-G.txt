goalkeeper Francesco Toldo sparked a scare at Italy &apos;s training camp on Wednesday after two club team mates , including Argentine Gabriel Batistuta , went down with German measles . 
the Italian squad is training at their base near Florence ahead of World Cup qualifiers against Moldova in Trieste on Saturday and in Poland on April 2 . 
Toldo informed team doctors that fiorentina team mates Massimo Orlando and Batistuta had the illness . 
as a precautionary measure , he was moved out of the room he was sharing with fellow goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi . 
the doctors , who said there was no question of the goalkeeper being asked to leave the camp , also told him to keep his distance where possible from other players . 
but his mother later told Italy to relax . 
&quot; Francesco had German measles when he was five , &quot; she said .
