total direct foreign investment in Romania since the 1989 end of communism rose to $ 2.2 billion at the end of 1996 from $ 1.6 billion the previous year , the Romanian Development Agency ( ARD ) said on Monday . 
it said the $ 608.4 million in foreign investment last year came from contributions of capital to newly created joint ventures , increases of capital of existing companies and investment in privatised companies . 
the largest single foreign investor in Romania is South Korea &apos;s Daewoo Heavy Industries Ltd , which last year put $ 53 million into a Romanian Black Sea shipyard , raising its investment in the Balkan country to $ 200 million . 
the South Korean company had previously bought a 51 percent stake in a local car marker , which it plans to expand further before the year 2000 on $ 1.0 billion investment . 
Romania hopes foreign investment , now at a paltry level compared with other East European countries , to pick up this year as the new centrist government pledged to support foreign investors by boosting facilities , including tax cuts and foreign ownership of land . 
local economists say in order to attract foreign investors cash-strapped Romania will have to speed up restructuring and privatisation , secure a smooth run of the foreign exchange and capital markets and work out of a separate law on portfolio investment . 
local media recently said a group of around 20 U.S. and British companies were expected in Romania early in February to look into investment opportunities in chemistry , the heavy and machine-building industries and in the capital market . 
envisaged investment by those companies was $ 10 billion .
