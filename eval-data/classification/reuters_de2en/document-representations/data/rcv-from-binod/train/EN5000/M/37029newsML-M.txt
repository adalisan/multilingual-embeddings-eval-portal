Polish yields are expected to hold relatively flat at Monday &apos;s 700 million zloty primary T-bill auction after an unexpected decline at the previous tender , analysts said on Friday . 
they said demand would fall to between 1.1 and 1.3 billion zlotys from 1.92 billion at last Monday &apos;s auction , when yields defied market expectations and tumbled under the weight of a large number of less competitive non-banking sector bids . 
&quot; Non-financials bought much of the shorter-term bills offered at the last tender and drove down yields , but that will not happen next Monday , &quot; said Bartosz Kumela of Societe Generale in Warsaw . 
the surge in non-banking sector bids was likely caused by increased activity of insurance firms , which are capable of placing large amounts of cash and moving yields alone . 
analysts said insurers were not active in secondary trade this week , which could be a signal they might stay on the sidelines at the primary auction on Monday . 
some even expected the average yield of the 52-week T-bill to inch up to between 19.40 to 19.45 percent against 19.39 percent at the last tender . 
the 13-week and 26-week T-bill yields are likely to stay relatively flat at 18.73 and 19.28 percent respectively . 
on Monday , the treasury will offer 450 million zlotys of 52-week T-bills , 150 million of 13-week bills and 100 million of 26-week paper . 
analysts said that low liquidity on the money market this week should also keep yields underpinned on Monday . 
&quot; Money market rates rose and curbed demand for bills coming from banks looking to finance daily needs , so yields are likely to stay at present levels on Monday , &quot; said Piotr Bednarek , senior T-bill dealer at ING bank in Warsaw . 
one-day deposit rates held above the money makret &apos;s main 14-day drainage rate of 19.05 percent for most of the week as banks searched for money on the cash-dry market . 
&quot; The money market &apos;s usual overliquidity was absent this week , but banks are not nervous because it is still early in the monthly reserve period , &quot; said Radzislaw Radziszewski , deputy chief dealer at Pekao SA . 
analysts said the row in Poland &apos;s ruling coalition following the dismissal of the Trade Minister had no effect on secondary market yields . 
but analysts said yields would react if the conflict caused early parliamentary elections or alter the present economic programme of bringing down inflation . 
the Polish zloty was expected to remain quiet again next week , bouncing within its recent band between 1.5 and 1.9 percent from the trading band centre in light trade . 
the zloty closed the week at 1.75 percent from the parity rate , slightly stronger than last week &apos;s close at 1.68 percent . 
it was at 2.7500 to the dollar and at 1.8515 per mark .
