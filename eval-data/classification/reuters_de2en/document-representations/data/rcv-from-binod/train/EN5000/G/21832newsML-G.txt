business travelers who find working on the road is expansive in an unwelcome way may have plenty of company . 
a recent survey found that half of more than 500 business travelers polled said they ate more while on out-of-town assignments than at home , and one in four said they hit the bar In addition , 57 percent said they ate later when travelling . 
the survey was conducted for Hilton Hotels Corp. as part of its research into finding ways to help guests get a better night &apos;s sleep . 
avoiding heavy meals , especially late in the evening , and staying away from alcoholic beverages at least three hours before bedtime are two of the keys to a proper night &apos;s sleep , according to the company and the National sleep Foundation , which helped conduct the research . 
the hotel chain has been investigating what makes people sleep better away from home and plans soon to offer experimental sleep-friendly rooms with various amenities in several cities . 
among the items in or around the rooms may be extra insulation for soundproofing , live plants , devices that produce neutral sound or &quot; white noise , &quot; a store of pillows in a variety of shapes and textures and a sleep mask and earplugs . 
on another hotel room topic , a survey conducted by Fodor &apos;s Travel Publications Inc. found that about six out of 10 guests always check the bedsheets first when they get into a new room . 
thirty-seven percent order room service , about one in four can &apos;t resist unlocking the in-room bar , whether they buy anything from it or not ; and 31 percent take the complimentary toiletries when they check out . 
in another area of interest to frequent travelers , the trend toward charging guests a fee for early checkout , which began earlier this year , appears to be spreading in the lodging industry . 
frequent flyer Magazine reports in its September issue that inter-continental is testing a $ 50 early departure fee for convention guests at its hotel in Chicago , and Renaissance is trying out a fee of the same size at hotels in Dallas and Washington . 
Fifty-dollar fees are also being tested by Wyndham at the Anatole in Dallas and by Lowe &apos;s at Washington , Annapolis , Md . , and Nashville , Tenn . , the publication said . 
variations of the fee concept are already in place at many Westin , Hyatt and Hilton properties .
