Afghanistan &apos;s deposed government has pleaded for negotiation , not confrontation , with Taleban forces after counter-attacking the conquerors of Kabul . 
the fundamentalist Islamic Taleban halted the fierce assault from ousted government army chief Ahmad Shah Masood , but suffered a serious setback in the fighting . 
Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani , driven from his capital by the Taleban last month , told reporters on Wednesday : &quot; We do not support more war . 
everything possible should be achieved through negotiation . 
Rabbani sounded almost meek by comparison with remarks he made on Monday when he vowed to take the offensive against the Taleban . 
Rabbani met Uzbek strongman General Abdul Rashid Dostum in Mazar-i-Sharif on Tuesday . 
Dostum &apos;s military and political support is needed to stem the Taleban tide now lapping northern Afghanistan . 
the president said his aim was to form a broad-based and united front against the Taleban , and that he had invited all factions to join him in an effort to reunify the country . 
it remained unclear whether Rabbani had invited Dostum to join the government , or if Dostum would accept if invited . 
but Dostum , who presides over a liberal Islamic administration , seems to have decided the Taleban are the main enemy , Afghan watchers said . 
Dostum left the Rabbani government in 1994 , after clashing with defence chief Masood . 
Taleban leaders dismissed the potency of an alliance between Dostum and Masood . 
&quot; Rabbani is at the end of things . 
he is going to be finished very soon along with his forces , so I don &apos;t think Dostum will get together with him at this stage , &quot; acting deputy foreign minister Sher Mohammed Stanakzai told a news conference . 
but Dostum told reporters in Mazar-i-Sharif , from where he controls six of Afghanistan &apos;s 33 provinces with a strong army and small air force , that Masood was due in the city this week . 
that was a strong signal of an imminent political alliance . 
the Taleban militia , who now control two-thirds of the country , swept into Kabul on September 27 and drove the government from the city . 
the rebels then moved north to bottle up Masood in his Panjsher Valley fortress , 
the government &apos;s counter-attack in the Salang Pass , which started on Tuesday , inflicted heavy casualties among the Taleban ranks . 
Western aid workers quoted witnesses in the Salang Pass through the Hindu Kush mountains as saying they had seen at least 100 bodies of Taleban fighters and many more wounded being ferried down the steep-sided , narrow gorge . 
Maulavi Khairulla Haqani , the Taleban battlefield commander in the Salang , told Reuters Television the fighting had been fierce . 
&quot; It was very hard to contain the attacks and the fighting was very serious , but we brought up heavy reinforcements and halted it . 
we are now in control , &quot; he said on Wednesday . 
but his new command post was 15 to 20 km ( nine to 12 miles ) south of where the Taleban front line had been in the Salang Pass , a winding defile that runs north from Kabul to Mazar-i-Sharif . 
the Taleban say they are dedicated to bringing peace , security and the stern Islamic Sharia law to Afghanistan , ravaged by 17 years of war , and that they want all Afghans to take part in a future government without ethnic considerations . 
Stanakzai repeated the position of the Taleban , that they would rather negotiate with Dostum than fight him . 
the government &apos;s attack forced the Taleban to suspend the assault on the Panjsher from the town of Golbahar , which sits astride the sheer-sided gorge that leads into it . 
the European Commission on Wednesday criticised the Taleban , accusing them of depriving women of fundamental rights . 
in a statement , the European Union executive said rules imposed on women by the Taleban contravened the United Nations Charter and world conventions on human rights . 
the Taleban have told women they should stay at home , not work and be completely veiled in public . 
schools are also to be closed to girls .
