Russia will withdraw some of its troops from islands at the heart of a perennial territorial dispute with Japan , the head of the local government of the islands told Japanese reporters . 
Vladimir Zema , chief of the South Kuriles District , told Japanese reporters visiting the islands that the two army units on Kunashiri will be pulled out by the end of June , the daily Asahi Shimbun reported on Wednesday . 
the reporters were accompanying Hokkaido Governor Tatsuya Hori , who will be visiting the islands until May 23 . 
the dispute over the islands , called the South Kuriles by Russia and the Northern Territories by Japan , has prevented the two countries from signing a World War Two peace treaty . 
the 3,500 Russian troops stationed on the islands have been a major roadblock in bilateral territorial negotiations . 
it was not clear if Russia will pull out all of the troops . 
Kunashiri , Habomai , Shikotan and Etorofu , located northeast of the northernmost main Japanese island of Hokkaido , were seized by Soviet troops in the closing days of World War Two . 
in a landmark visit to Japan in 1993 , Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed to settle the dispute through political dialogue and vowed he would pull out troops from the islands , although he did not give a deadline . 
last week , Russian Defence Minister Igor Rodionov visited Tokyo and handed to Japan documents saying Moscow had reduced the troops on the islands to 3,500 by 1995 but did not speak about further cuts . 
Rodionov , the first Russian defence chief to visit Japan , promised troop cuts across the nation and expanded defence exchanges with Tokyo , and gave Moscow &apos;s blessing to closer U.S.-Japan military ties . 
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda travels to Moscow this weekend for talks with Yeltsin and other government leaders . 
Ikeda will lay the groundwork for an exchange of visits of prime ministers before the end of the year and for next month &apos;s Denver summit of the Group of Seven ( G7 ) major industrialised countries , which Russia will attend for the first time as a full member , the Foreign Ministry said .
