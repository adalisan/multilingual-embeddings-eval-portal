midfielder Davide Fontolan scored the opening goal of Italy &apos;s serie A season on Saturday to give newly-promoted Bologna a 1-0 home win over UEFA Cup hopefuls Lazio . 
Fontolan , a summer signing from Internazionale , headed home in the 35th minute to give Bologna a perfect start to their first top flight match in five years . 
the delighted Fontolan was then shown the yellow card for excessive celebrating . 
Lazio , at Lens of France for their opening UEFA Cup match on Tuesday , had three of Italy &apos;s top scorers in their line-up but failed to find the net in a match watched by Italian national coach Arrigo Sacchi . 
striker Giuseppe Signori , the top marksman last season with Igor Protti who joined Lazio after Bari were relegated , came on as a second half substitute in place of Protti but was unable to find the equaliser . 
Lazio &apos;s Italian international striker Pierluigi Casiraghi played the full 90 minutes . 
he was booked but made little impact .
