Swedish shares ended lower on Wednesday after coming off morning highs , still suffering U.S. jitters and with the downward move seen as a correction after a strong performance so far this year . 
the exchange &apos;s general index fell 1.17 percent to 2,600.40 , adding to a 4.34 percent dive on Tuesday , in turnover of 5.09 billion crowns . 
&quot; Now people have finally found a reason to sell and many think it isn &apos;t finished yet , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; It &apos;s a badly needed downturn and there is absolutely no panic . 
telecoms group Ericsson was the most traded . 
Ericsson dropped six crowns to 247.5 on worries after its U.S. PCS customer pocket filed for bankruptcy . 
but Ericsson denied it was financially exposed to pocket . 
the forestry sector was the largest loser among sectors and plunged 2.42 percent , but AssiDoman again bucked negative trends and ended flat at 200 crowns . 
S-E-Banken rose 1.5 crowns to 79.5 , fuelled by the merger between Norway &apos;s Christiania Bank and insurer Storebrand . 
but Nordbanken , still viewed as a possible merger partner with S-E-Banken , dropped eight to 244 .
