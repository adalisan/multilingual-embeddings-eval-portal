Dutch shares slumped 3.36 percent in one of their biggest ever one day falls , battered by options related selling after remarks from Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan pointing to higher US interest rates . 
&quot; There &apos;s been panic selling mainly out of the options market ahead of the expirations tomorrow , &quot; said one dealer . 
&quot; The remarks from Greenspan have shaken out big sellers . 
the AEX index of 25 leading Dutch shares closed 24.73 points down at 710.31 , back up from a session low of 700.54 . 
the index has dropped 70 points or nearly nine percent since it reached its 779.02 all-time high seven trading sessions ago on March 11 . 
shares had plunged 1.50 percent at the opening on derivatives-related selling , doubling Wednesday &apos;s 6.69 point fall on increasing nervousness about a U.S. rate rise . 
Greenspan &apos;s remarks on Thursday that the U.S. economy retained a &quot; great deal of vigour &quot; and that the jobs market was strong were taken as a signal the Federal Reserve was inching towards raising interest rates , possibly next week . 
his remarks had a similar impact on the Dutch share market as his criticism last December of &quot; irrational exuberance &quot; in some financial markets . 
those comments sparked an intra-day selloff of nearly 39 points in the AEX index . 
selling pressure built up on the options exchange to the point that exchange authorities suspended trading for 10 minutes shortly before the AEX close . 
computer-driven &quot; programme &quot; trades in shares and dealings in baskets of the 25 shares which make up the main AEX share market were also suspended , a spokesman for the exchange said . 
exchange figures show that Thursday &apos;s fall is the biggest one day fall in percentage terms since a 6.6 percent fall in October 1989 , although that figure itself was dwarfed by the 12.00 percent drop on &quot; Black Monday &quot; , October 19 , 1987 , the day that sparked a deep equity market slump around the world . 
&quot; There &apos;s still a lot of fear about interest rates , people are getting more and more nervous . 
today &apos;s fall has got a lot to do with panic , &quot; one dealer said . 
analysts have for a while been saying the AEX was overvalued during its rise from 648 since the end of 1996 . 
&quot; It was already too high , but we knew that when it went through 750 and then through 770 that we had to be involved , &quot; said a dealer . 
&quot; This was a predictable correction , we could see the index back below the 700 level soon enough , &quot; he added . 
a recent Reuter poll of analysts &apos; expectations for the AEX averaged at 712 for the end of 1997 although some had seen it as low as 680 .
