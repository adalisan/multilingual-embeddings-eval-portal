China issued a stinging attack on Japan on Saturday , accusing Tokyo of conniving with rightwingers who have built a lighthouse on a group of disputed East China Sea islands and describing ties as distressed . 
&quot; It is incomprehensible that the Japanese government has taken no effective measures to prohibit such activities , &quot; said a commentary carried in the Communist Party mouthpiece , the People &apos;s Daily . 
&quot; Instead , it has taken a laissez-faire attitude and even connived at these activities , which have damaged Sino-Japanese friendship , &quot; it said . 
a simmering dispute over the islands , flared in July after a rightist Japanese group built a lighthouse on one of the uninhabited but potentially resource-rich islands , known in Chinese as the Diaoyus and in Japanese as the Senkakus . 
&quot; The Japanese government should ban such activities to reverse the adverse impact they have produced , &quot; the People &apos;s Daily said . 
&quot; The acts , which defy China &apos;s solemn and just representations , cannot but arouse the indignation of the Chinese people , &quot; the People &apos;s Daily said . 
the islands are claimed by Beijing , Tokyo and Taipei . 
outrage over Japan &apos;s refusal to tear down the Diaoyu lighthouse has united nationalist sentiment in Beijing as well as in its arch-rival Taiwan . 
even democratic activists in Hong Kong have joined calls for tough action by China . 
the People &apos;s Daily criticised remarks by a Japanese official that Tokyo &apos;s decision to send warships or planes to patrol the islands was not linked to the territorial dispute so long as Tokyo exercised effective jurisdiction over the islands . 
&quot; These erroneous and irresponsible words not only violate previous understandings between the two countries , but also bolster and encourage the right-wingers who are intentionally provoking China , &quot; the People &apos;s Daily said . 
&quot; This has led to the now distressing position of Sino-Japanese relations , which was quite clearly started unilaterally by Japan , &quot; it said . 
the row over the islands intensified this week after Tokyo effectively supported the rightists by sending patrol ships to repel private Taiwan vessels that tried to approach the islands . 
Japanese rightists sailed to the islands and repaired the makeshift aluminium lighthouse , which was damaged by a typhoon last month , touching off anti-Japanese protests in Chinese communities in Hong Kong , Macau , Taiwan and mainland China . 
the People &apos;s Daily warned that the row could jeopardise the hard-won friendship between Japan and China , where many remember the brutal invasion in the 1930s and 1940s by Japan &apos;s Imperial Army when millions of Chinese were killed . 
&quot; Sino-Japanese friendship has not come easily and embodies the efforts of several generations of Chinese and Japanese , &quot; the newspaper said . 
&quot; It should be cherished and safeguarded by both sides . 
&quot; Any attempts to lead Sino-Japanese relations astray will do neither side any good , &quot; it said . 
&quot; People wonder whether the illegal activities of the Japanese rightwingers have the government &apos;s tacit support and whether there are ulterior motives for stirring up these incidents . 
on Tuesday , Beijing lodged a strong protest with Tokyo and called in its charge d &apos;affaires in Beijing , warning of serious damage to bilateral ties if Japan failed to stop its rightists from setting foot on the islands . 
China and Taiwan , rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 , agree the islands have been China &apos;s for centuries and dispute Tokyo &apos;s claim , which dates to China &apos;s forced cession of Taiwan and the Diaoyus after its defeat by Japan in 1895 .
