recent fighting between warring factions has displaced thousands in Afghanistan &apos;s Shomali valley north of Kabul , pushing the number of refugees in the capital to 200,000 , the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) said on Tuesday . 
&quot; The latest sharp increase in the displacement ... is the result of intense fighting which led up to the Taleban losing the key town of Charikar over the weekend to fighters belonging to the northern anti-Taleban alliance , &quot; it said . 
the statement said most of those who arrived in Kabul last week were among the remaining inhabitants of Parawan province capital Charikar , 64 km ( 40 miles ) north of Kabul . 
&quot; The town , which is believed to have had somewhere between 100,000 and 150,000 inhabitants a year ago , is now reported to be largely deserted of civilian inhabitants . 
the bazaars are closed and there is a shortage of drinking water . 
the statement said the Shomali valley -- an important agricultural region thrusting northwards from Kabul into the surrounding Hindu Kush mountains -- had been largely depopulated by continuing fighting and forced displacement . 
&quot; While many of those who have left the Shomali region did so to escape fighting , tens of thousands of them were ordered from their homes by the Taleban , &quot; it said . 
&quot; The great majority of those who have entered Kabul have lodged with friends and relatives , adding considerably to the problems facing the city &apos;s poverty-stricken inhabitants . 
the UNHCR said a large number of people from the valley had entered Pakistan and if they remained unable to go back to their homes , an even larger number of people from Kabul would proceed to Pakistan in search of assistance . 
Pakistan has about 1.2 million Afghan refugees , including 50,000 who had left Afghanistan after the capture of Kabul by the purist Islamic Taleban militia in September , a UNHCR official said . 
he said repatriation of refugees was also taking place to peaceful areas of Afghanistan . 
about 40,000 Afghans had left Pakistan in the first six months of this year . 
the United Nations urged warring factions in Afghanistan on Monday to halt immediately aerial bombing of civilian targets , cease all hostilities and begin genuine peace talks . 
the U.N. Special Mission to Afghanistan ( UNSMA ) , in a statement issued in Islamabad , expressed &quot; grave concern &quot; over the increase in hostilities in recent weeks amid stepped up peace efforts by UNSMA and some countries .
