Thai rubber prices eased from last week in a quiet market as supplies jumped by over 400 percent from the previous week , trade sources said on Friday . 
favourable weather after a prolonged monsoon encouraged farmers to tap more rubber , raising the amount of rubber entering the market by 447.12 percent to 165,105 kg , they said . 
&quot; Perhaps they are just making up for the lost time , &quot; said a trader in hat Yai , referring to the monsoon which flooded the southern region in December and disrupted production . 
other traders said they believed the recent weakness in yen also discouraged buyers from entering the market . 
&quot; But now that the situation has improved , more Japanese buyers might enter the market , &quot; one trader said . 
the price of the benchmark RSS3 for February shipment was quoted at around US $ 1.23-1.24 a kg fob Bangkok compared with $ 1.25-1.26 in the previous week . 
Latex prices also eased to $ 0.93 a kg on the same basis against $ 0.94-0.95 last week .
