Romania &apos;s central bank ( BNR ) said on Friday the average rate on its one-week refinancing funds fell to 160 percent from last week &apos;s 175 percent amid undersubscription on the back of a cash-heavy money market . 
the Lombard rate , set by multipling the average rate by 1.6 , also slipped to 256 percent from last week &apos;s 280 percent . 
the BNR &apos;s offer of 150 billion lei , down from a previous 200 billion , was undersubscribed , with two banks entering bids totalling 85 billion at rates equalling the central bank &apos;s minimum permitted rate . 
traders said most banks had tried to place the excess of leu funds in T-bills which offer attractive returns . 
results of Thursday &apos;s public subscription for T-bills were unavailable .
