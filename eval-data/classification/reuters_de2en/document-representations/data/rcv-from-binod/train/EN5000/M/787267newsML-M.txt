the Hungarian bourse hit more all-time highs this week while Warsaw &apos;s late-week surge suggested foreign capital was not scarce . 
Czech , Croatian and Slovenian shares also gained but Slovakia and Romania saw losses . 
the Central European Share Index ( CESI ) , which follows price movements in 72 Hungarian , Polish , Czech , Slovak and Slovenian shares , rose 8.2 percent on the week . 
Hungarian shares paused late in the week after setting three straight closing highs , propelled mainly by earnings hopes before the August 15 deadline for firms to report first half figures and supported by a strong dollar . 
in the region the Budapest Stock Exchange is the most correlated to movements on the U.S. market due to the high proportion of foreign portfolio investors in Hungary . 
spectacular gains by SPT Telecom and Komercni Banka , on the back of first half earnings results published last week , led the official Czech PX50 index to its biggest gain for several weeks . 
local analysts were surprised by the strength of the gains -- SPT rose 12.6 percent , Komercni by 13 percent -- particularly by Komercni which saw a sharp decline in net profits . 
but foreign investors seemed to be taking a different view , stressing that the bulk of the bank &apos;s profit slump could be explained by unrealised losses on securities in the wake of the crown crisis which were likely to be made up later in the year . 
SPT was the only major Czech company whose first half results were immediately welcomed as good news by most investors . 
but they cautioned that a round of profit taking might be imminent . 
Polish shares rose 10.9 percent by Friday to 16,759.7 points and analysts said large investors were apparently taking advantage of the relatively low prices . 
&quot; It seems that after the several-week fall on our bourse prices had become attractive for investors with lots of capital , &quot; said Dariusz Szepieniec of Bank Slaski brokerage . 
analysts said some investors might be shifting funds from neighbouring bourses such as Budapest which hit recent highs while Polish shares had suffered due to macroeconomic concerns such as a widening current account deficit and recent floods . 
analysts warned that more rapid growth could lead to a downward correction some time next week and said some investors might still refrain from buying before the September 21 parliamentary elections . 
Slovenia &apos;s SBI index firmed 1.56 percent on increased foreign buying and traders forecast shares would drift sideways until the end of August . 
&quot; We cannot expect foreign demand to stay as strong as in the past two days throughout August so I expect the index to remain around the same level to the end of the month , &quot; one trader said . 
the index gained 24.23 points to close the week at 1,576.89 . 
Croatian stocks closed the week firmer on Friday , led by drugs firm Pliva &apos;s third consecutive record-breaking session and analysts said the stock could continue to push the market up in coming days . 
traders said the market was moved by increased interest from foreign buyers and an optimism that would likely last , though growth could slow from the past three weeks &apos; fast pace . 
Pliva climbed 15 kuna to a new peak of 615 kuna and was seen as extending gains on foreign demand . 
but another record-breaker this wek , Zagrebacka Banka , ended its bull-run on Friday , shedding 78 kuna to 2,505 . 
unlike Pliva , the bank was seen pausing for breath in the days ahead . 
Slovak shares continued in sluggish trading this week . 
the new division of markets , which came into effect on August 1 , has so far failed to have direct impact on trading . 
both volume and turnover made in direct trading have significantly overshadowed those generated on the listed , registered and free markets of the automated system . 
the official 16-share SAX index closed at 168.42 points on Friday , easing 0.83 points from Monday &apos;s open at 169.25 . 
the Bucharest bourse inched down this week despite some gains by second-tier stocks as buyers remained reluctant to join trading , brokers said . 
trading on the first-tier was dominated by refrigerator maker Arctic , which joined the bourse last Friday . 
it shed 100 lei on Friday to 3,500 . 
brokers forecast no major changes in the coming days .
