goalkeeper Hans Segers told a court on Monday he had never thrown a soccer game , and that the season during which police alleged he threw matches was highly successful for his club Wimbledon . 
Segers , 35 , was asked by his lawyer whether he had ever thrown a game of football in his life . 
&quot; Never , &quot; he replied . 
&quot; Nobody asked me to throw a game , I &apos;ve never thrown a game . 
Segers is accused along with another top goalkeeper , Bruce Grobbelaar , of taking money to influence the outcome of top English games . 
former footballer John Fashanu and Malaysian businessman Heng Suan Lim are accused of being middlemen for a gambling syndicate . 
all four deny the bribery charges . 
Dutch-born Segers is the first of the accused to take the witness stand . 
Fashanu &apos;s lawyer said last week that his client would not testify . 
Segers denied he had ever met any of the Indonesians said by the prosecution to be members of a Far Eastern syndicate trying to fix games in the English premier league . 
Segers said he provided information on English games to Lim , and also predicted the results of Dutch soccer matches for him , and was paid as much as 1,500 pounds ( $ 2,440 ) a week if his predictions were good . 
Lim denied last week fixing games , saying he just asked Grobbelaar and Segers for tips about top games . 
Segers played in goal for PSV Eindhoven in the Netherlands before moving to English club Nottingham Forest in 1984 , then transferring to Wimbledon in 1988 . 
he told the court that the 1993 / 4 season when he is alleged to have taken bribes was particularly successful for Wimbledon . 
&quot; We finished in the top six . 
that equalled the best position Wimbledon have ever done , &quot; he said . 
Segers said that in 1994 he received a wage of 1,000 pounds a week , plus a signing-on fee of 30,000 pounds and a 50,000 pound loyalty bonus , plus sundry other payments . 
in addition , he had a stake in a tie company and did some football commentary for Dutch television . 
Segers said that in 1993 / 4 between 25,000 and 30,000 ties were sold in Britain , realising a profit for the company of up to 90,000 pounds . 
the profit was shared with a partner living in the Netherlands . 
a part of Segers &apos; money was paid into a Dutch account in the Netherlands , and the rest was given to him in cash by the partner when he came to England . 
that money was then deposited in a Swiss bank account via a branch of a bank in London . 
the company supplied ties to France and Germany , and also had a contract to supply Barcelona football club in Spain . 
profits from these sources were also given Segers in cash .
