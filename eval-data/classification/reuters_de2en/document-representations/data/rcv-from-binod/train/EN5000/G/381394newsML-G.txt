NATO &apos;s eastward expansion , the top issue on new U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright &apos;s tour of European allies , will not be blocked by a Turkish veto stemming from Ankara &apos;s disputes with Brussels , her spokesman said on Sunday . 
spokesman Nicholas Burns said Washington was sure all 16 members of the Atlantic Alliance would agree at their Madrid summit in July to invite some former Warsaw Pact states to negotiate NATO membership . 
burns spoke shortly after Albright arrived in Bonn from Rome on the second stop of a whirlwind 11-day tour to nine countries in Europe and Asia , her first since taking over as America &apos;s first female chief diplomat . 
finding ways to make a larger NATO palatable to Moscow is high on the agenda for her talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Monday , he said . 
it will also figure at her meetings over the next few days in Bonn , Paris , Brussels , London and Moscow . 
she also plans to visit Seoul , Tokyo and Beijing . 
&quot; We believe NATO enlargement will go ahead on the 7th and 8th of July and that is the will of all the NATO countries , &quot; he said when asked about Turkish threats to block it if Ankara did not get more European Union aid . 
Turkey had long supported NATO expansion and recent threats by Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller were &quot; not welcome &quot; , Burns told journalists . 
&quot; We don &apos;t agree with them . 
earlier on Sunday in Rome , Albright and Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini agreed NATO &apos;s summit to invite new members should go forward regardless of whether a proposed charter with Russia on a new special relationship is ready . 
at a news conference with Dini , she said : &quot; we came to agreement on a whole set of issues , especially NATO enlargement and the NATO-Russian charter . 
Dini said they both agreed an enlarged NATO was not meant as a threat to Russia and should not be viewed as such . 
the alliance is trying to assure Russia , where official opposition to NATO taking in new members is fierce , that expansion will enhance the security of all of Europe and not be directed against Moscow . 
Albright made no progress with Dini and Prime Minister Romano Prodi on rows over trade with Iran , Libya and Cuba although they agreed on keeping NATO &apos;s Naples-based southern military command in American hands , U.S. officials said . 
the two governments also opposed a French idea for the U.S. , Germany , Britain and France to hold a mini-summit with Russia to help work out the new relationship . 
Washington says Iran and Libya sponsor terrorism . 
it also believes Iran is seeking to acquire nuclear capability while Iraq continues to try to rebuild its military arsenal in contravention of U.N. sanctions after the Gulf War . 
the U.S. has accused Libya of harbouring two suspects blamed for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland . 
U.S. law permits sanctions against companies doing business in Iran and Libya . 
burns said later that in the meeting with Dini &quot; there was a very long conversation about the ( European ) critical dialogue with Iran , about Italian relations with Libya and a little less disagreement on Iraq &quot; . 
Albright told the Italians : &quot; We don &apos;t see that the critical dialogue is working ... We see Iran embarking on military modernisation , attempting to acquire weapons of mass destruction and ( engaging in ) direct and incontrovertible support for terrorism in the Middle East , &quot; Burns said . 
the issue would probably come up again with the Germans , but Kinkel made clear in a weekend newspaper interview Bonn planned to continue its &quot; critical dialogue &quot; with Tehran .
