Albanian protesters blockaded the southern city of Lushnje on Friday , occupying a main road and burning a police truck in anger at the right-wing government over their losses in failing pyramid schemes . 
Albanian state-run television said around 5,000 residents of Lushnje , 85 km ( 55 miles ) southwest of Tirana , gathered to demand the return of their money from pyramid schemes , whose assets were frozen by the state last week . 
they hurled stones at the city hall and pelted riot police sent in to disperse them . 
some protesters set up a blockade on the main artery linking southern Albania with the capital and set fire to a police vehicle , state television said . 
&quot; Inside the town it is calm now but the main road is blocked with people and damaged cars . 
cars cannot pass without the people &apos;s permission , &quot; an eyewitness said . 
&quot; The police are completely paralysed , &quot; he added . 
at an urgent meeting President Sali Berisha ordered the setting up of a commission to look into ways of reimbursing pyramid scheme investors . 
on Thursday , the right-wing government banned the controversial schemes in a bid to quell popular unrest . 
it also warned operators they could face up to 20 years in jail . 
the authorities have seized around 25.5 billion leks ( $ 255 million ) deposited with banks by two bankrupt schemes but the money may not be sufficient to satisfy thousands of Albanians who have poured their life savings into the companies . 
&quot; All the frozen money plus the bank interest will be returned to the investors , &quot; television quoted Berisha as saying . 
the Lushnje protest was the latest incident in two weeks of popular unrest directed against the crumbling pyramid schemes . 
&quot; All Lushnje has put its money into the Xhaferri and Gjallica ( investment schemes ) . 
we refuse to stand by while they gobble up our money , &quot; one woman told Reuters . 
&quot; We will not leave this place until we get our money back , &quot; a young man said . 
Mario Kempes , the Argentine coach of the Lushnje soccer team , was led away by friends from the scene of the protest . 
the club is owned by the Xhaferri family , which operates one of the controversial schemes . 
Albania &apos;s official ATA news agency said Lushnje town hall suffered broken windows and riot police sent to end the disturbance came under a hail of stones . 
&quot; For 45 minutes riot police sheltered behind their trucks while the crowd hurled stones and other objects , &quot; ATA said . 
residents said some police officers removed their caps as a sign of solidarity with the crowd . 
police intervened to disperse the crowd , but succeeded only in driving some protesters onto Albania &apos;s main north-south artery , where they brought traffic to a standstill and attacked government vehicles . 
four trucks full of riot police , sent to break up the road block , failed and protesters set fire to one of the trucks .
