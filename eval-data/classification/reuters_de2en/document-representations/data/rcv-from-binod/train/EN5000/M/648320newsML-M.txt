figures in brackets compare against previous day &apos;s close 
* Money market seen tracking tight ranges in short term 
new Zealand debt ended mixed on Monday as the short end struggled to compensate for the downward effect of a weaker dollar / yen on the NZ dollar &apos;s Trade-Weighted Index ( TWI ) while longer bonds tended firmer . 
the Reuters Monetary Conditions Index ( MCI ) showed conditions moving out past 100 basis points easier than the Reserve Bank &apos;s March assumptions , before coming back to end at 96 points below the assumed level . 
at one stage the stronger yen saw the TWI shoot below 67.2 from its 67.47 open . 
by the close , however , it had regained some of that fall and was at 67.28 . 
the 90-day bank bills finished four basis points weaker at 7.07 percent , after trading up to 7.12 percent while the TWI was at its lows . 
dealers said the TWI was the focal point of the session . 
&quot; But as everyone understands , it &apos;s not the result of a loss of faith in the New Zealand dollar -- it &apos;s just the fact that dollar / yen has been moving very strongly . 
&quot; There are a lot of yen / Aussie trades going through , and again , our mechanical TWI has just been responding passively , &quot; one dealer said . 
the Australian and Hong Kong debt markets were closed for public holidays , which meant local trade had been thinner and more whippy than normal . 
dealers said the money market was starting to flag under the TWI &apos;s pressure . 
the 90-days kept finding it difficult to sustain a move below seven percent , and were likely to track narrow ranges around current levels in the short term . 
the 02 / 00 bonds ended flat at 6.96 percent after rallying at the open to 6.92 percent . 
the 10-year maturity backed up four points from its open , but at 7.21 percent still finished below its 7.25 percent Friday close . 
one dealer noted corporate borrowing interest was beginning to emerge in the interest rate swaps market after a fortnight of calm . 
&quot; Investors are a little bit reluctant to go chasing the market when this MCI tells them bill rates should be one percent higher ... but the five-year , four-year and three-year swaps have all got down to around that 7.5 percent level to borrow term 
employment , trade and food price data later in the week may provide the wider market with some direction . 
in general , however , dealers expect that once Wednesday &apos;s June futures close out has been and gone , traders will demonstrate a marked lack of enthusiasm for taking big positions ahead of the budget and the next central bank set piece at the end of June .
