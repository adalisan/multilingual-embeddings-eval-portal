air Force fighter jets resumed some training flights in designated areas off the Atlantic and Gulf coasts on Tuesday after a suspension sparked by encounters between civilian and military aircraft . 
the Air Force said at least four Air Combat Command units resumed training and reserve and other units were beginning to fly in the areas . 
a suspension began on Friday to study procedures to eliminate close encounters . 
the Defence Department , meanwhile , denied that any of the four mid-air incidents reported last week had involved &quot; tailgating &quot; of jetliners by regular Air Force or National Guard F-16 fighter pilots practicing battle intercepts . 
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said the incidents , including an Air National Guard F-16 that pulled within 1,000 feet ( 304 metres ) of a Boeing 727 off New Jersey and triggered the jet &apos;s collision warning system , were under investigation by the military and civilian agencies . 
I think that may cheapen the type of operation they were doing here . 
I think they were carrying out normal operations ... &quot; Bacon told reporters in response to questions . 
but he also stressed that Air Force active , reserve and National Guard pilots were being made aware that pulling too close to civilian planes could trigger automatic collision warnings , causing commercial pilots to make violent and harrowing avoidance manoeuvres . 
the flight suspension in training areas off the East Coast was ordered Friday by Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Ronald Fogelman and on Monday , he expanded it to include the Gulf of Mexico . 
the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the incidents -- two off the East Coast , one over Texas and one over New Mexico -- and the FAA ordered a close look at coordination procedures among military and civilian flight controllers . 
&quot; The flying public , I believe , has nothing to worry about because the Air Force pilots are well trained to stay out of the way of civilian airliners , &quot; said Bacon . 
&quot; One of the things that we are learning is that the ( anti-collision ) system is sensitive and can be triggered at ranges that may be larger than some pilots may have counted on , &quot; he said . 
in the incident off New Jersey last Wednesday , a Boeing 727 charter jet with about 80 passengers manoeuvred violently in response to electronic cockpit instrument warnings when it was approached by one of two New Jersey Air National Guard F-16s .
