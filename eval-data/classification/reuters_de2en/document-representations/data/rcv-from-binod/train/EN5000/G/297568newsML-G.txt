the European Parliament &apos;s third biggest group -- the Union for Europe -- said on Thursday it would back the election of European People &apos;s Party ( EPP ) deputy Jose Gil-Robles Gil Delgado as parliamentary president next Tuesday . 
but the group denounced the way the selection had been made , and the carve-up of the parliamentary bureau and Questors between the two biggest groups , the Socialists and EPP . 
it said the carve-up did not take account of all the political forces in the European Union and left the less populated nations without any representation on the pivotal parliamentary bodies . 
in protest at the sharing out of the five posts of Questors -- who act as internal parliamentary watchdogs -- between the two groups , the UPE will propose Ireland &apos;s Mark Killilea for one of the spots , it said in a statement .
