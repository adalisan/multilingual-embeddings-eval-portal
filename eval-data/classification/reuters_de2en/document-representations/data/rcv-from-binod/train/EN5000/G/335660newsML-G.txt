twelve Cypriot environmentalists were arrested on Monday when they entered a firing range on the island &apos;s remote Akamas peninsula trying to stop British military exercises there , police said . 
&quot; Several demonstrators have been removed but there are still some out there , &quot; police spokesman Glafcos Xenos told Reuters . 
&quot; We are trying to remove them from the firing range for their own protection , &quot; he added . 
the demonstrators , members of local environmentalist organisations , were later released without charge . 
but another smaller group , including a member of parliament , was still hiding in thick vegetation at the firing range where British soldiers were due to start week-long exercises . 
they ignored repeated police appeals on a loudspeaker to leave the firing range , witnesses said . 
the activists , who camped in the north western peninsula overnight , had scattered into the woods earlier Monday when anti-riot police appeared on the scene . 
in the meantime , 30 soldiers from the British base of Episkopi on the island &apos;s southern coast arrived in Akamas to start their exercises . 
the infantry training , in which live ammunition is due to be used , ends on Friday . 
&quot; It is our intention that the exercises go ahead , &quot; said Mervyn Wynne-Jones , a spokesman for the British bases in Cyprus . 
soldiers from two military bases which Britain has retained on the island since independence in 1960 are allowed to train in the Akamas for up to 70 days a year . 
local and international environmental bodies have called for the peninsula to be declared a national park . 
Britain argues that the military exercises protect the environment by keeping developers at bay .
