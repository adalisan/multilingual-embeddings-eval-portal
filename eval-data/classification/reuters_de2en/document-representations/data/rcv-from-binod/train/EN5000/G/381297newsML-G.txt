Israeli and PLO peace negotiators launched a new round of talks on Sunday aimed at expanding Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza , officials said . 
the talks , convened at kibbutz Maale Hahamisha , a collective settlement west of Jerusalem , were to set up further implementation of interim agreements signed since a landmark 1993 peace deal between Israel and the PLO . 
the agenda for the talks beginning on Sunday included arrangements for Palestinian sea and air ports , a &quot; safe passage &quot; between the West Bank and Gaza , economic , civil and financial affairs and &quot; people to people &quot; cooperation , officials said . 
before talks began , the PLO put Israel on notice it expected &quot; final status &quot; talks on the thorniest issues dividing the two sides to resume next month after a brief initial session last May . 
the issues include the fate of Arab East Jerusalem , Jewish settlements , Palestinian refugees and the shape of Israeli-Palestinian borders . 
&quot; Today is only the opening of the talks , and tomorrow we will start discussing the issues , &quot; chief Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud Abbas told reporters after shaking hands with his Israeli counterpart , Foreign Minister David Levy . 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met last week , paving the way for the Sunday talks , a follow-up to a U.S.-brokered breakthrough under which Israel handed the PLO control over most of the West Bank town of Hebron last month . 
before the Sunday talks began , Levy warned Arafat he would set back peace moves if the Palestinians pressed the issue of Jewish settlements at the resumed negotiations . 
levy was answering a warning from Arafat on Saturday that Israel would &quot; gamble &quot; with peace by expanding settlements on occupied Arab land . 
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told Reuters settlements would be among the topics to be covered in &quot; final status &quot; talks , suspended since an opening session prior to Netanyahu &apos;s upset election victory in May . 
&quot; We want the Israeli government also to know that as of next month we will resume the negotiations on a permanent status on Jerusalem , on settlements , on refugees and borders , and the Israeli government should not pre-empt these negotiations by trying to put fait accompli policies on the ground ... confiscating the I.D. 
cards of ( Arab ) Jerusalemites , expansion of settlements , ( or ) imposing new regulations and laws . 
Israel and the PLO have agreed to conclude final status talks by May , 1999 . 
Palestinians fear Netanyahu &apos;s hardline government will accede to pressure by Israeli rightists to bolster settlement activity ahead of talks on the fate of Jewish enclaves , where some 130,000 settlers live among the more than two million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza . 
Netanyahu , due to return on Monday from a U.S. visit and talks with President Bill Clinton , faces mounting demands from members of his own Likud party and rightist coalition partners to speed home building in settlements . 
disgruntled settlers voiced irritation with the visit to Hebron on Sunday of Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai . 
Hebron settler spokesman Noam Arnon said Mordechai failed to make good on government pledges to bolster settlement in the town of some 400 Jews and more than 100,000 Arabs . 
&quot; To approve just another half a house here , ( to be begun ) several months from now , is to make a mockery of us , &quot; Arnon told Israel Radio . 
&quot; We feel humiliated in this situation .
