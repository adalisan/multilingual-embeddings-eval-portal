copper prices fell back during late Thursday afternoon LME trading , with a late sell-off and lower close reflecting nervousness over stocks , traders said . 
LME stocks tomorrow , are mostly forecast falling by between 4,000 and 15,000 tonnes , and a decrease of 10,000 tonnes would take total inventories under 100,000 tonnes for the first time since July 1990 , they noted . 
in late trading there was some talk that stocks could rise tomorrow , which induced some liquidation , although the overall consensus is still for declines to be maintained . 
meanwhile , the market remains vexed over the issue of sizeable tonnages of non-LME stocks that may or may not exist in Rotterdam as reported by the WBMS on Wednesday . 
the consensus view is that if some 500,000 tonnes had accumulated in the Netherlands between 1990 and 1995 it would have been delivered against the innumerable backwardations that have prevailed during the 1990s . 
prices were on the defensive for most of Thursday , but support around $ 2,020 was maintained , and last trade was at $ 2,032 a tonne , down $ 28 from the previous kerb . 
cash / threes was at $ 76 / 86 backwardation . 
volumes in copper were not large , indicative of the nervousness and uncertainty in the market , while the rest of the non-ferrous metals complex tended to follow the red metal . 
aluminium generally held in a tight range , but after showing little inclination of running up and testing $ 1,450 , fell away on the kerb to close at $ 1,428 , down $ 14.50 . 
nickel prices successfuly defended the downside , however , with the market bouncing away from the $ 7,100 level and maintaining a mini-rally in the afternoon . 
last business was at $ 7,160 , down just $ 5 from Wednesday . 
but lead and zinc were affected by the sell-off in the copper market , with prices turning lower during the kerb and ending at or around the lows . 
last lead business was at $ 725 , a $ 13 loss , while zinc closed at $ 1.059.50 , a $ 3.50 decline . 
tin similarly lost ground during the latter part of the trading session , but business was largely routine and restricted to a fairly tight range . 
prices closed at $ 5,980 , down $ 10 . 
the alloy market dipped under $ 1,300 at one point but last business was at that level , down $ 5 from Wednesday .
