options traders took advantage of the weakness in British Telecommunications shares on Monday in order to buy call options , in the belief the underlying stock will rally in the weeks ahead , dealers said . 
but some traders believe the situation may change and that BT &apos;s share price is ready to step up a gear . 
one deal in BT options was to was to buy 1,000 May 460 calls at 8p . 
another was to buy 500 May 420 calls at about 28p . 
( $ = 0.617 British pounds ) . 
in retailer Marks &amp; Spencer , the main options deal was from a seller of 700 June 500 calls at 11p to protect against losses from a shareholding in M &amp; S if the share price slips . 
over in shipping and transportation group P &amp; O , there was a buyer of 500 May 600 calls at 21p , hoping the underlying shares will bounce . 
and in conglomerate Lonrho , the main deal was the sale of 400 December 140 puts at 5p indicating a willingness to buy the shares at 140p -- owing to being assigned the puts -- if the stock price is below the strike price , which it now is . 
Lonrho shares were 1 / 2p lower at 132p .
