monthly price talks for Syrian crude exports in January were deadlocked on Monday despite a revised offer from state-owned Sytrol , term buyers said . 
Sytrol began talks last week offering its Light crude at a premium of 13 cents a barrel to benchmark dated Brent but late last week cut it to Brent less 10 cents after a frosty response from its customers . 
term buyers said the new offer was still far too high , representing only a five-cent reduction on December levels , when the price of its main competitor , Russian Urals , has fallen by about 50 cents in the same period . 
&quot; It &apos;s tough going this month , &quot; said a customer in the Mediterranean . 
&quot; We &apos;re getting close to the first loading window so they will have to settle things soon but we &apos;re not willing to pay more than ( dated ) -50 cents , &quot; he added . 
others said they were also expecting to receive telexes from Damascus later on Monday . 
the value of sour crude in the Mediterranean slid last week as Iraq began selling its first exports for more than six years under an U.N. oil-for-food deal . 
European refiners have signed up for as much as two-thirds of the 500,000 bpd Baghdad is allowed to sell to raise $ 2 billion every six months for humanitarian purposes .
