trading house Cargill said on Tuesday an orderly delivery of the November IPE gas oil contract has been prevented by what it called delays and failures to nominate by the counterparty . 
Cargill , the dominant long on the contract , added in a statement that it had referred its concerns about the delivery to the International Petroleum Exchange ( IPE ) . 
&quot; Cargill had adequate storage space and was fully prepared to take delivery from the outset of this process , but we have been frustrated by a series of delays and failures to nominate on the part of the seller that have prevented us from lifting all quantities of product in the first two delivery windows , &quot; the statement said in an apparent reference to AIC , the dominant short . 
Cargill added : &quot; We regret this development and will continue to try to ensure an orderly delivery for the remainder of this contract . 
we have kept the IPE authorities fully informed throughout this process and have forwarded to them our specific concerns related to this delivery . 
&quot; We trust these issues will be resolved through proper administration of the IPE rules . 
Cargill officials said the statement &apos;s use of the word nominate in reference to the seller referred to nomination of locations and quantities . 
asked for comment , an AIC spokesman denied Monte Carlo-based AIC had caused any delay or had failed to meet any of its obligations . 
the Cargill statement was the latest in a flurry exchanges between Cargill and AIC about their performance over the contract &apos;s record high 865,100 tonne delivery . 
Cargill has been due to take delivery of at least 627,800 tonnes of the total , to be lifted in three five-day periods , November 16-20 , 21-25 and 26-30 . 
AIC last week said Cargill had failed to lift the required volume in the first five-day period and earlier on Tuesday said it had defaulted on its obligations in the second five-day window as well . 
AIC said Cargill had failed to lift 50 percent of the amount it was due to take in Amsterdam and 70 percent of the amount it was due to take in Antwerp , during November 21-25 . 
Cargill said on Thursday there had been some problems in the first five-day delivery period but it hoped to resolve these through IPE channels . 
then on Tuesday this week Cargill said it was working with the IPE to resolve problems on the second five-day window . 
in its latest statement -- its second on Tuesday -- Cargill expanded on those comments , saying : &quot; Cargill is continuing to work with IPE authorities and all parties to the November gas oil contract to try to resolve the delays and other problems that have hampered delivery under this contract .
