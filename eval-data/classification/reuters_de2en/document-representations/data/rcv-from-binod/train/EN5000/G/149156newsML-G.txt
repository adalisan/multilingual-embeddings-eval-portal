Egyptian rescue workers were trying on Monday to free five people trapped beneath the rubble of a Cairo apartment block that collapsed , killing three others . 
about 100 people are mising and feared dead after the 11-storey residential building crumbled to the ground on Sunday in the suburb of Heliopolis , two blocks away from the residence of President Hosni Mubarak . 
rescue workers heard voices after they had blasted a hole in a huge concrete slab that covered what used to be the front of the building . 
I &apos;ve got three others here with me , &quot; the workers heard a man shout from under the debris . 
police said the other three were alive . 
rescue teams stopped using the bulldozers and heavy machinery for fear of further jeopardising their safety and were using crowbars instead . 
rescue teams said they had found another survivor at the top of the mound of rubble , but the woman was trapped under what used to be a ceiling . 
a Reuters correspondent at the site earlier saw rescue workers carry away a corpse on a stretcher covered with a green blanket . 
doctor Mahmoud Riyad of the nearby Manshiyet el-Bakry hospital said one of the dead was an old woman who had suffocated beneath the dust and concrete slabs . 
the work of rescue teams had been hampered for some time when they had difficulty getting equipment onto the site , which is situated on a narrow road . 
Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri told Reuters that rescue workers had so far pulled out 19 survivors . 
doctor Tala &apos;at Ezzedine of Manshiyet Bakry hospital said rescue crews had found 17 people in the rubble . 
he said two had later died and that the other 15 were being treated for injuries . 
only a corner of the 25-year-old apartment block remained standing and a policeman at the scene said rescue workers thought this is where any survivors were likely to be . 
&quot; Noura , Noura my daughter , Noura , &quot; wailed an elderly woman in a black robe . 
others shouted the names of relatives while some sobbed hysterically outside the cordoned-off area . 
&quot; All of a sudden we heard a sound like a bomb and then dust . 
then we heard what sounded like people crying for help , &quot; said Magdi Abdel Fouttouh who lives in the neighbouring block . 
the porter of the building said he thought renovation work in one of the 40 apartments might have affected the infrastructure and caused the collapse . 
Abdel Fouttouh said he believed a bank had set up business in the building and had been carrying out renovation work . 
&quot; They may have removed some columns on the inside , &quot; he said . 
local residents said the landlord had erected seven illegal floors and that the local council had been demanding their removal since 1991 . 
soaring real estate prices have often pushed landlords to add extra floors on top of their property , usually illegally . 
several buildings have collapsed beneath the extra weight and recent earthquakes have also taken their toll on poorly constructed buildings in the crowded capital .
