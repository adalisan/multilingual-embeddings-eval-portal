yields for Romanian three-month treasury bills sank to 49 percent at Wednesday &apos;s auction from 65 percent in the previous session last month , central bank ( BNR ) data showed . 
the finance ministry issue of 643.24 billion lei in rollover bills was heavily oversubscribed with 18 banks bidding a total 1.598 trillion lei . 
BNR data showed the finance ministry accepted 643.24 billion lei worth of bids which offered yields ranging from 45 percent to 80 percent . 
some 75 percent of the T-bills , placed through a Dutch style auction , were bought by banks and the rest went to their corporate clients . 
the fixed-interest T-bills &apos; issue date is June 6 and they mature on September 4 . 
but traders said short-term money market prices stayed near 60 percent with some players ready to take leu funds . 
they said the yield plunge was a result of low bids made by banks keen to take such paper in their portfolio . 
in recent weeks , the money market has been highly liquid as the BNR soaked up the dollar excess to prevent the leu from firming . 
the BNR dollar purchases flooded the money market with leu funds , triggering a rapid fall in interest rates to about 60 percent , compared with about 190 percent in early April . 
on Wednesday , the leu was trading at about 7,140 / 180 to the dollar , almost unchanged from levels earlier this week .
