Indian stocks will kick off on Monday close to 12-month highs after a five-week rise , but a short-term slip was possible before the next upward charge , traders said . 
Bombay &apos;s index has rocketed nearly 34 percent so far this year , making it the best first-half gain in the last five years . 
the blue chip gauge has shown a handsome gain of 427 points , or nearly 12 percent in the last five weeks . 
&quot; lately , we have seen a lot of volatility and that is a little unnerving , but the overall mood remains positive , &quot; Alok Sethi , director at Natwest Markets , told Reuters . 
and only sporadic profit taking should interrupt a fairly smooth uptrend ahead for stocks , analysts said . 
&quot; We could see share prices weakening a bit , &quot; said Ashith Kampani , head of dealing at JM Share &amp; Stock brokers , adding there were signs of overbought positions in some stocks . 
&quot; A correction would make the markets stable and ready prices to power ahead , &quot; Kampani said . 
last week , Bombay &apos;s benchmark 30-share index closed 50.20 points or 1.23 percent higher on Friday at 4,133.24 , just shy of a 52-week high of 4,153.80 scaled earlier in the day . 
petrochemicals major reliance Industries , which drew profit-taking by institutional investors after announcing a generous one-for-one bonus share issue last week , was likely to consolidate an 80 percent jump in its share price this year , traders said . 
market attention will focus on a crucial meeting on Wednesday of India &apos;s ruling United Front coalition to decide whether to raise petroleum prices . 
the coalition &apos;s inability to reach a decision during the past few weeks has led the market to discount news of a long overdue hike . 
a five to 10 percent increase in oil prices had been factored into the market , traders said . 
&quot; It kind of dampens the mood , but it has become a bit of a non-issue , &quot; Natwest &apos;s Sethi said . 
at its last meeting on June 16 , the minority coalition deferred a decision on whether to raise prices to plug the government &apos;s mounting debt to state oil companies . 
foreign institutional investors have been the biggest buyers during the market &apos;s bull run , with net foreign institutional investment between June 1 and June 24 totalling 10.84 billion rupees ( $ 302.6 million ) , unofficial figures show . 
net foreign institutional investment inflows in May were $ 198.4 million against $ 148.5 million in April and $ 184.8 million in March , according to Securities &amp; Exchange Board of India figures . 
&quot; The demand / supply mismatch is driving up stocks , &quot; said Sandeep Dhingra , research analyst at SSKI Securities . 
&quot; It &apos;s purely a liquidity play . 
a one percentage point cut in the key bank lending rate to 10 percent announced by the Reserve Bank of India last week was one more positive factor for the market , traders said . 
the State Bank of India , ( SBI ) the country &apos;s largest commercial bank on Saturday decided to trim its prime lending rate to 13.5 percent from 14.0 and added further cuts could be on the way if lending did not pick up . 
&quot; It is good news for the economy . 
companies who were actually not in a position to borrow can be expected to get some funds , &quot; said a dealer at a foreign brokerage firm . 
&quot; We expect the markets to be up again . 
many foreign funds are coming in and the index looks to be forming a support level near the 4,000 mark . 
cement stocks which have been major underperformers will be in the spotlight in the coming week on the back of a change in the market &apos;s outlook for the sector . 
&quot; There are early indications of higher price realisations and better volumes , &quot; the dealer at the foreign firm said . 
&quot; People are finding better values in these stocks .
