* crude can move either way with RSI &apos;s back in neutral territory but analysts remain generally bullish with good trendline support pointing the market higher . 
* gasoline comes up against a wall of resistance around 66.50 cents which it needs to break if its bullish trend is to continue . 
NYMEX crude and products prices were seen continuing in an uptrend on Thursday with bullish technicals supported by fundamental demand , but gasoline must close above 66.05 cents a gallon to confirm the reversal of its recent downtrend , analysts said . 
analysts said crude was technically bullish with short-covering against oversold indicators bringing prices back up again this week and the market . 
&quot; The past four trading days have seen ( NYMEX crude ) hold a bullish trend parallel to that seen between July 21 and August 2 , &quot; said Tom James , analyst at Credit Lyonnais rouse in Singapore . 
&quot; Now all the Iraqi news is out the technicals are the key , &quot; James added . 
RSI &apos;s crept back into neutral territory from being oversold so the market can move either way , but analysts remained generally bullish with good trendline support pointing prices higher . 
initial support was pegged around $ 20 with resistance at Wednesday &apos;s $ 20.30 high . 
strong gasoline and firmer heating oil also lent support to crude with the former responsible for gains across the complex over the past couple of days . 
however , the contract comes up against a wall of resistance around 66.50 which it needs to break down if it &apos;s bullish trend is to continue . 
&quot; September gasoline &apos;s strong rally yesterday leaves it bumping against resistance at 66.50 . 
this level will influence whether 67 cents and then 67.60 cents are reachable , &quot; Leslie Nicholas at GNI Research said in his daily report . 
&quot; Indicators are looking more favourable on a the daily continuous chart now , even if the move was rather quick , &quot; he added . 
James said , &quot; Although the bearish trend of nine days was reversed last night when the market closed back in the old bullish uptrend , I would wait for at least one more close in the old bullish trend above 66.05 on the prompt contract ( to confirm the reversal ) . 
the bullish trendline is drawn from the lows of the July 21 , July 23 and August 1 on the spot month continuation chart . 
near triple bottom support around 54.25-30 cents a 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level puts a good base in the market for heating oil while gasoline &apos;s rally saw the market testing 38.2 percent Fibonacci resistance at around $ 56 , which remains intact .
