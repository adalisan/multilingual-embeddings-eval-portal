the legend of Danny Morrison , world &apos;s cricket &apos;s lame duck batsman defying England &apos;s attack gathered pace on Wednesday , English cricket &apos;s more vocal critics were calling for heads to roll at the latest failure by the national team . 
Morrison &apos;s defiant final wicket stand with Nathan Astle to save the first test in Auckland has captured the imagination of the British media , with The Times in an editorial today calling the New Zealand No.11 &quot; a hero for all underdogs matched against hopeless odds &quot; . 
and , perhaps overestimating the Classical knowledge of New Zealand cricket fans , it added : &quot; For the carousers in the club bars of New Zealand , Danny Morrison &apos;s last stand will today rank in history with such epic feats as Horatius holding the bridge and Roland blocking the pass . 
&quot; Morrison &apos;s bulldog determination to play each ball on its merits , to look certain defeat in the eyes and stare it down , and never to surrender are lessons to relish everywhere . 
the Times headed its back sports page with a graphic of 24 ducks , representing his 24 test noughts , but with a swan at the end representing his latest innings . 
it headed its story : &quot; The day England turned cricket &apos;s ugly duck king into a swan &quot; . 
the Guardian called Morrison &quot; a bunny with bottle &quot; , while the Daily Mail dubbed Morrison &apos;s test record &quot; a real quacker &quot; . 
meanwhile , England &apos;s failure to press home their advantage on the last day has led to inevitable calls to sack skipper Mike Atherton . 
significantly , the calls have come from figures outside the game , and safely ensconced in an English winter . 
ray Illingworth , who stood down as England &apos;s chairman of selectors at the end of last season , laid the blame at Atherton &apos;s feet , but reserved special criticism for bowling coach Ian Botham . 
&quot; Mike Atherton must take much of the blame for England &apos;s unbelievable failure to beat New Zealand yesterday , &quot; Illingworth wrote in the Express . 
&quot; His lacklustre , unimaginative captaincy , along with some awful bowling , lay at the heart of another alarming tour debacle . 
Illingworth said Atherton did not set the correct fields to Morrison , crowding the bat to pressurise him , and failed to take advantage of having five bowlers . 
he said the England skipper should not be written off but was now under immense pressure . 
Botham , too , must answer questions , said Illingworth , after the poor bowling display . 
he said England &apos;s bowlers should put more thought into their play : &quot; That is where technical adviser Ian Botham ought to be making an impact . 
but maybe he &apos;s not as good as he thought he was , maybe he &apos;s not finding it as easy a job as he thought it 
would be . 
not surprisingly , the tabloid Sun and Mirror were much more direct . 
&quot; shouted the Sun , with the Mirror adding : &quot; Get out now Ath &quot; . 
a Sun editorial said bluntly : &quot; The England cricket team is a joke -- it couldn &apos;t beat an egg . 
&quot; There &apos;s only one solution . 
Atherton must Ath-ter-go .
