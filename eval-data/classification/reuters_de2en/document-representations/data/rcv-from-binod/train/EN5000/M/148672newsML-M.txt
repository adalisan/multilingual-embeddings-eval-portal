the dollar started the week strongly on Monday , hitting a 42-month high above 114 yen against the generally weak Japanese currency , while key European bourses consolidated Friday &apos;s revival . 
market analysts said the yen suffered as Japanese investors kept on searching for higher-yielding investments abroad . 
&quot; Japanese investors are still showing a tremendous appetite for overseas assets , &quot; said Pat Magill , head of the corporate desk at Daiwa Europe in London . 
&quot; At some stage they must hedge it though -- Japanese investors have been caught badly in the past by being in overseas assets and then losing as the underlying currency depreciated against their domestic currency , &quot; Magill added . 
compared with its advance against the yen , the dollar showed less movement against the mark amid fading market hopes for German interest rate cuts . 
looking slightly further ahead , markets focusing on the health of the American economy face a busy week for U.S. data , culminating in October jobs figures on Friday , although no key statistics are due on Monday .

&quot; This is not going to be a day for a furious advance but the phase of consolidation seems to have passed , &quot; said one Frankfurt dealer . 
the London stock market , Europe &apos;s busiest , quickly reversed slight opening losses to head higher after a boost from news of a takeover bid for Northern Electric , whose shares rose 115 pence to 635 pence . 
British equities had started slightly weaker , tracking lower bonds , but traders said news of a new bid was just what the market needed to refuel its rally . 
&quot; The Dow ended more or less where we left it , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; We are waiting for U.S. non-farm payrolls on Friday and we &apos;re only a month away from the ( British ) budget , &quot; he added . 
this week &apos;s main economic diary entry in Britain is Wednesday &apos;s monthly monetary meeting between the British finance minister and the Governor of the Bank of England .
