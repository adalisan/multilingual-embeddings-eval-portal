Oman said on Wednesday it had frozen ties with the Israeli government and they would remain on ice until Israel adhered to what Muscat said were the Jewish state &apos;s commitments to the Palestinian leadership . 
&quot; The Sultanate of Oman has frozen ties with the current Israeli government , &quot; Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah told reporters . 
&quot; And the contacts will remain frozen until we feel that the Israeli government adheres to what will satisfy our Palestinian brothers ... Then we will review the possibility of resuming official contacts with the Israeli government , &quot; he said . 
Israel signed a deal with the Palestinian authorities last year to withdraw its troops from major West Bank towns , but delayed a pullout from Hebron after a wave of militant Islamic suicide bombings in Israel in February and March . 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who in May ousted the government that negotiated the deal , put the agreement on hold , saying changes were needed to enhance security for Jewish settlers . 
Abdullah said the joint Arab position reached at the Cairo economic conference in November was to maintain the Arab-Israeli peace process while not allowing Israel to evade commitments made by the previous left-wing government . 
but he said the Netanyahu government appeared &quot; to want to renegotiate most of the agreements which were signed by the previous government . 
this is not possible and not acceptable . 
Oman and Qatar have gone further than their Gulf Arab allies to establish ties with Israel . 
but both states have stopped short of full diplomatic ties pending resolution of all Arab-Israeli conflicts . 
since September &apos;s Palestinian-Israeli clashes over Israel &apos;s opening of a tunnel near Jerusalem &apos;s al-Aqsa mosque , Islam &apos;s third-holiest site , Qatar has put its contacts with Israel on hold .
