the dollar drifted higher by the U.S. close , recovering from a bout of profit-taking after the weekend Group of Seven nations meeting pushed the dollar sharply higher against the mark and yen , dealers said . 
the dollar surged to a 37-month peak against the German mark and near its 55-month high against the Japanese yen after the outcome of Sunday &apos;s meeting between G7 officials in Washington was more lenient than traders had anticipated . 
&quot; If anything , the market was a little surprised of the lack of forcefulness in the G7 comments , &quot; said Dennis Pettit , trading manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think the market perceives any heightened risk of central bank intervention today as opposed to Friday , &quot; he added . 
traders said neither the official communique released after the G7 gathering nor comments by officials gave any hint that they plan to intervene in the foreign exchange markets , a measure the United States has not used since August 1995 . 
but U.S officials did publically pressure Japan to prevent a &quot; significant increase &quot; in its trade surplus with the rest of the world . 
further weakening of the yen could widen the nation &apos;s trade surplus . 
&quot; The communique suggested it is a case of watching the pot , but it &apos;s not boiling yet , &quot; Ron Leven , currency strategist at J.P. Morgan . 
&quot; There are references to not wanting trade to become a problem without saying it is a problem , &quot; he added . 
in the communique , finance ministers said major currency misalignments had been corrected , and excessive volatility and deviations from fundamentals were undesirable . 
shortly after the dollar reached its highs in the Far East , dealers began to cash in profits and pushed the U.S. unit down to just above Friday &apos;s U.S. close . 
the dollar ended Monday &apos;s U.S. session at 1.7320 / 30 marks , below its 1.7389 marks Tokyo high but above its 1.7316 / 19 open . 
against the yen , the U.S. currency closed at 126.83 / 88 , also below its 127.08 high but above the 126.63 / 73 open . 
the dollar &apos;s retreat against the mark was compounded by investors selling the British pound and buying marks ahead of Thursday &apos;s UK general election , which polls show will bring 18 years of unbroken Conservative Party rule to an end in favor of Tony Blair &apos;s Labor Party . 
in other trading , the dollar rose against its Canadian counterpart after Canada &apos;s Prime Minister Jean Chretien , on Sunday , called a June 2 general election , 17 months before the required date . 
Chretien has only governed for 3-1 / 2 years , but currently has a broad lead in the polls over a badly split opposition . 
sterling inched higher to $ 1.6242 / 52 from $ 1.6235 / 45 and the dollar rose to 1.4730 / 40 Swiss francs from 1.4725 / 35 . 
the Australian dollar fell to $ 0.7800 / 05 from $ 0.7804 / 09 .
