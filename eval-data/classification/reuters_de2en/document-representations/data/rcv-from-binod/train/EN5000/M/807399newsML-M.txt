Southeast Asian palm oil prices are expected to rise this week to offset weakness in the Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah , regional traders said . 
strong demand was also expected to boost sentiment . 
&quot; It will be a currency market this week . 
if the rupiah weakens further against the U.S. dollar , prices will have to be adjusted higher , &quot; an Indonesian trader said . 
&quot; Otherwise , players will just export their oil because of better prices overseas . 
regional players are also closely watching the ringgit &apos;s movement against the dollar . 
the ringgit fell to a historical low of 2.8250 to the dollar last Friday . 
&quot; Palm oil is likely to move up further this week if the ringgit stays weak , and local prices will be very competitive against Indonesian palm , &quot; a Kuala Lumpur trader said . 
the rupiah fell to a historic low of 2,960 to the dollar on Friday in reaction to the central bank decision to scrap its intervention band on Thursday . 
&quot; The lower rupiah will make exports more competitive . 
but local prices will have to adjust to export prices , otherwise there will be no interest in the market , &quot; said another Indonesian trader . 
Indonesian palm olein ended last week at 1,570 rupiah / kg in Jakarta , up from 1,470-75 rupiah the previous week . 
on Friday , Malaysia &apos;s benchmark third-month October futures closed at 1,269 ringgit a tonne , against 1,220 a week earlier . 
it is expected to test immediate resistance of 1,280 , before heading for the 1,300 psychological level . 
we could see another rally this week , &quot; the general manager of a trading house in Singapore said . 
a fall in end-July palm stocks , released by Malaysia &apos;s Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority ( PORLA ) , to 769,275 tonnes from 789,806 tonnes at the end of June looks &quot; pretty positive &quot; for the market , he said . 
traders said palm oil prices were getting a boost from strong offtake from India and China . 
&quot; It &apos;s looking good . 
China has been taking a superb number of imports , &quot; a dealer in Singapore said . 
Singapore dealers said the only cloud hovering over the market was the fact that output remains robust . 
the peak production period in Malaysia is coming up and fears over a possible slowdown in export offtake in the next few months may then hit prices , they said . 
&quot; People may say that production is running great and take that as a bearish signal , &quot; said one dealer . 
PORLA said exports in July soared to 715,906 tonnes against 622,210 tonnes in June . 
&quot; Production is going to be excellent . 
people are asking if China and India can maintain the strong offtake they &apos;ve shown lately , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; My bias is slightly upward , maybe by about 10 ringgit in the Kuala Lumpur commodity Exchange ( KLCE ) , &quot; another Singapore-based dealer said .
