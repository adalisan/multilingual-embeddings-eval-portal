Turkey on Wednesday could not clear up confusion over a comment by Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller who said she had reports of Iranian troops fighting alongside an Iraqi Kurdish group in northern Iraq . 
foreign ministry spokesman Omer Akbel declined to say where Ciller &apos;s information had come from , other than the media and a rival Iraqi Kurdish group . 
&quot; The minister &apos;s statement is true , &quot; he told a news briefing . 
&quot; This information has first of all appeared in the press , &quot; he said . 
Ciller said on Tuesday she had information that Tehran was giving military support to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) militia against the pro-Baghdad Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) group . 
&quot; ( The information ) is coming as reports . 
I do not want to say they are true or not . 
but we have information on the subject , &quot; Akbel said . 
he cited statements by the KDP as another source of Ciller &apos;s information . 
&quot; Iran has always been in the belief that backing any group in northern Iraq would only heighten tension there and that regional countries ... should help ease tension in the region , &quot; IRNA quoted the source as saying . 
Turkey &apos;s Akbel said Iran had told Turkey it had not sent men , weapons and ammunition to northern Iraq to back the PUK , as alleged by the KDP . 
the two Kurdish groups are fighting in the mountains across the border from Turkey &apos;s own mainly-Kurdish region over territory and a makeshift oil trade .
