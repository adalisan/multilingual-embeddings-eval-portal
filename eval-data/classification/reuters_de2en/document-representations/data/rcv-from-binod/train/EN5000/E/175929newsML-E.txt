Slovenia &apos;s state Institute of macroeconomic Analysis said on Friday the inflation rate in 1996 is expected to rise to above nine percent , up from 8.6 percent last year . 
&quot; Our latest estimate is that the inflation rate would remain below 10 percent but will be higher than nine percent , &quot; the institute &apos;s senior analyst Dusan Kidric told Reuters . 
the centrist government of Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek last year predicted that inflation would fall to six percent by the end of 1996 . 
Drnovsek , who faces a general election on Sunday , revised his estimate in October , putting the inflation forecast for 1996 at between eight and nine percent . 
the prime minister told Slovenian television on Thursday that reining in inflation had been one of the success stories of his four-year term of office . 
in 1992 , the year after Slovenia declared its independence from former Yugoslavia , inflation had reached 93 percent . 
in October , year-on-year inflation had risen to 9.7 percent from 9.4 percent in September .
