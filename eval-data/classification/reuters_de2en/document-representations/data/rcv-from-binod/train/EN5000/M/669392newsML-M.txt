Mediterranean crude oil markets were mixed with most refiners holding off awaiting more specific news on the timing of the restart of Iraqi exports . 
with limited Urals on the market , prices have risen sharply and talk of a deal at dated Brent -92 cents though not immediately confirmed was thought reasonable . 
&quot; If you need the crude now you have to pay up although it &apos;s just a matter of time before the market collapses , &quot; one refiner said adding that sour refining margins were still positive at current crude levels . 
some refiners were looking to new horizons for their refinery feeds and one Spanish refiner has bought a million barrels of sour Venezuelan crude .

Syrian state oil company Sytrol &apos;s offer on Wednesday of dated Brent minus 55 cents for Syrian Light liftings in July - up from a discount of 77 cents in June - left many regular lifters in shock and one has already decided not to enter the negotiations at all . 
&quot; For early July barrels somewhere around -70 / -65 cents is OK. but there should be two prices because when sour grades tumble later in the month these prices will be ridiculous , &quot; one said .

&quot; Everyone is waiting for more information on when we will see Iraqi crude so we know how long you have to hold off . 
everyone is convinced the sour price will tumble . 
there will be a flood of crude .

Iraqi oil minister Amir Muhammad Rasheed said on Wednesday that his country would resume crude exports under its oil-for-food deal with the United Nations as soon as a food distribution plan was completed . 
&quot; Iraq will resume oil exports under the oil-for-food and medicine agreement immediately after completing the distribution plan which is being discussed with the United Nations , &quot; Rasheed said . 
traders noted that the lower outright price for crude oil would result in extra barrels on the market in the 180 day period which is likely to start from June 8 . 
&quot; They &apos;ll have a lot more to sell to make their $ 2 billion and in a shorter period , &quot; one commented .
