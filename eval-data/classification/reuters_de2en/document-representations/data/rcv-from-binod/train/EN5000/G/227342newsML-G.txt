astronauts aboard the space shuttle Columbia , disappointed by the cancellation of their space walks , took time off to relax on Sunday , NASA officials said . 
the crew of five were mostly silent overnight after hearing that the two space walks planned for their mission had been cancelled because of Columbia &apos;s stuck outer hatch . 
NASA engineers were unable to determine why the hatch , leading from the airlock chamber to the cargo bay , had jammed , officials had said on Saturday . 
they feared attempts to force the door open would only make matters worse and called off two space walks aimed at practicing space station assembly . 
the astronauts were given an extra hour of sleep and awakened to &quot; Shooting Star &quot; by Bad Company at about 6 p.m. est ( 2300 GMT ) on Sunday to begin their 13th day in space . 
the crew was given a six-hour break from work on Sunday evening to take in the view of Earth from 220 miles ( 352 km ) up and to make private phone calls to family and friends . 
when they went back to work , astronauts Tammy Jernigan and Tom Jones were to test one of the tools they would have used during their spacewalks . 
they planned to test the &quot; power grip tool &quot; on bolts in the shuttle &apos;s mid-deck area , officials said . 
NASA managers were scheduled to meet on Monday to decide whether to extend the flight by one day so a U.S.-German orbiting observatory , released from the shuttle on Nov . 19 , could make further observations , said mission commentator Rob Navias . 
the Orfeus-Spas telescope , which was trailing Columbia by about 26 miles ( 42 km ) , was due to be plucked from orbit by the shuttle crew on Tuesday morning . 
the space telescope is studying interstellar matter in an effort to learn more about the life cycles of the stars . 
in the original flight plan , Columbia was due to return to Earth on Thursday with a landing at its home base in Florida . 
if mission managers decided to extend the flight by a day , the telescope would not be retrieved until late Tuesday or early Wednesday , officials said .
