France &apos;s constitutional watchdog on Monday approved a controversial law granting war veteran status and pensions to about 200 surviving French leftists who fought on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War . 
the Constitutional Council rejected a challenge by about 60 parliamentarians of the ruling centre-right coalition , who argued that many survivors of the International Brigades were communists who did not deserve honour for opposing fascism . 
the deputies had argued that the status of war veteran could be granted only to soldiers under the command of the French government and not to those who took part in the 1936-39 civil war against the insurgent troops of General Francisco Franco . 
but the Council said a 1926 law left it up to the French government to decide who should be awarded veterans &apos; identity cards . 
President Jacques Chirac backed the new measure , passed in early December , seeing it as a follow-up to tributes in November on the 20th anniversary of the death of writer and culture minister Andre Malraux , who led an international air squadron in the Spanish Civil War . 
the veterans , who were granted Spanish citizenship last month on the 60th anniversary of the Brigades &apos; creation , have long argued that they pioneered the fight against fascism before the Nazis set out to conquer Europe . 
some conservatives resisted it on grounds that the Brigades were heavily influenced by the Soviet Union . 
France officially stayed out of the Spanish Civil War but discreetly aided the Republicans against Franco , who went on to rule Spain from 1939 until his death in 1975 . 
around 35,000 men and women from 53 countries fought in the International Brigades , suffering 10,000 dead and earning a place in the Pantheon of left-wing heroes . 
a third of the 9,000 French volunteers were killed in Spain and half the survivors died in World War Two .
