Australion Acting Prime Minister Tim Fischer said on Tuesday Australia &apos;s June trade surplus showed a solid trend despite the impact of the Reserve Bank of Australia &apos;s large scale gold sale . 
&quot; ... yes there is an aspect that certainly relates to gold ... but even taking that out you still have a very solid set of figures , &quot; Fischer told reporters . 
&quot; There is a solid trend line developing . 
Fischer , who is also trade minister , was commenting on official data released earlier on Tuesday showing Australia &apos;s seasonally adjusted balance on goods and services in June was a record surplus of A $ 1.964 billion , compared with a A $ 787 million surplus in May . 
the June result was fuelled by the inclusion of A $ 1.8 billion of gold reserves sold by the Reserve Bank .
