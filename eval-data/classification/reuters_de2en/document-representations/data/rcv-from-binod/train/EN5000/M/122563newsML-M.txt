a strike at Kennecott copper Corp in Utah coupled with hopes of a sizeable drop in London Metal Exchange copper stocks Friday , lifted prices from their recent vulnerable levels , traders and analysts said . 
&quot; psychologically the strike probably helped , but the market was maybe due for a little bit of correction anyway , &quot; said William O &apos;Neill of Merrill Lynch . 
&quot; We can probably go a couple of weeks before it becomes a serious problem . 
LME stocks will also contine to go down for a while but it won &apos;t be a permanent situation . 
COMEX copper opened higher after LME was lifted in overnight trade by news that 1,800 workers at Kennecott &apos;s mine and 310,000 short tons per year smelter walked out on Wednesday . 
the market made most of its gains in the latter part of the session as the realisation of a strike sank in amid expectations that LME copper stocks will fall some 10,000 tonnes Friday . 
December COMEX settled 2.25 cents firmer at 90.90 cents per pound , traded 91.30 to 88.70 cents . 
volume was estimated at 12,000 lots , down from 13,464 Wednesday . 
Kennecott said management will continue to operate its facilities though output would inevitably dip to an undisclosed level . 
Labor talks resumed Thursday . 
the United steelworkers of America said the strike at Kennecott heightened tensions at Phelps dodge Corp &apos;s Chino mine in New Mexico where employees have been without contracts for more than three months at the 170,000 tons facility . 
the USWA represents most hourly workers at both plants , and Chino Labor talks resume October 24 and 25 . 
Phelps said Chino was operating normally at full output . 
some brokers believed that if Kennecott &apos;s strike persisted , the tight copper market in the U.S. would push up premiums paid over COMEX spot month rather than inflate LME and COMEX futures prices because metal globally was moving into surplus . 
&quot; Essentially copper is a broad-range trading affair between 87 and 95 cents per pound , &quot; O &apos;Neill said . 
&quot; There probably won &apos;t be much follow through to today , but Kennecott is something that has to be watched .
