the Dow Jones industrial average fell to its second biggest point loss ever Monday on a crush of selling sparked by the Japanese prime minister &apos;s comments about potential Japanese sales of U.S. government bonds . 
the Dow fell 192.25 points to 7,604.26 , a point decline second only to the 508-point drop when the market crashed on Oct . 19 , 1987 . 
the late afternoon sell-off was ignited by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto &apos;s comments that stable exchange rates were critical to Japan &apos;s continued buying of U.S. government securities . 
&quot; I hope the U.S. will engage in efforts and in cooperation to maintain exchange stability so we will not succumb to the temptation to sell off Treasury bills and switch our funds to gold , &quot; Hashimoto said after a speech carried on Reuters Financial Television . 
the federal government depends on strong foreign buying of its bonds to help finance the national debt of $ 5 trillion , so a decline in purchases by the Japanese could cause severe strain in U.S. financial markets . 
stock investors used Hashimoto &apos;s remarks as an excuse to take profits . 
analysts said stocks were set for a fall after the recent rally capped by Friday &apos;s rise in the Dow to a record 7,796.51 . 
in the broader market , declining issues swamped advances 1,771 to 816 on active volume of 492 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
while the Dow &apos;s decline was the second-largest point drop ever , the Dow would have to fall about 600 points at current levels to make the top 10 largest losses in percentage terms . 
the Treasury Department said Monday that the Japanese were already cutting back on their purchases of Treasury bonds . 
in the first quarter , Japan bought $ 12.9 billion of bonds and notes , down from $ 15.4 billion in the fourth quarter . 
&quot; This is one of our vulnerabilities because the Japanese have been big buyers of our securities and obviously should that buying reverse itself , than that would not bode well for our market , &quot; said Jack Shaughnessy , director of research at Advest . 
but he believed that Hashimoto was &quot; just posturing &quot; as part of the ongoing debate over yen-dollar exchange rates . 
prices fell in the bond market but not nearly as sharply as in stocks . 
the 30-year Treasury lost 17 / 32 , raising its yield to 6.70 percent from 6.66 percent on Friday . 
the price and yield move in opposite directions . 
the Dow index was the target of most of the selling after soaring more than 20 percent since the start of the year . 
&quot; The market was incredibily extended , &quot; said Roy Blumberg , chief investment strategist Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross . 
he said he expected buying at the end of the second quarter by portfolio managers would keep the sell-off from gathering steam . 
tobacco stocks fell for a second day after the announcement late Friday of the proposed liability settlement between the tobacco industry and U.S. states . 
action in individual stocks was highlighted by merger news . 
Union Pacific Resources Group Inc. offered a two-step deal to buy Pennzoil for about $ 3.9 billion plus the assumption of debt . 
Pennzoil jumped 17-3 / 4 to 77-3 / 8 while Union Pacific slipped 1-1 / 8 to 25-1 / 4 . 
tandem Computers Inc. leaped 5-3 / 4 to 20-3 / 4 after Compaq Computer Corp. said it agreed to acquire Tandem for about $ 3 billion in stock . 
Compaq ended off 2-7 / 8 to 103-7 / 8 . 
the Nasdaq composite index fell 12.78 points to 1,434.32 .
