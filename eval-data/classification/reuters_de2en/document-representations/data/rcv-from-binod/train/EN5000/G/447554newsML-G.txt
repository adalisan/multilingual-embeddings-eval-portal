Berlin authorities said on Monday they would step up the forced repatriation of thousands of Bosnian refugees unless they started returning home of their own accord . 
&quot; If more refugees do not volunteer to go , the quota ( of forced repatriations ) after Easter will rise , &quot; Berlin &apos;s Interior Minister Joerg Schoenbohm told a news conference . 
but he said none of about 29,000 mainly Moslem refugees in the city would be forced to return to the Serb part of Bosnia and those being treated for war trauma could also stay longer . 
&quot; We are ruling out the forcible return of traumatised refugees . 
those from Serb areas will also not be sent home yet , &quot; he said . 
Germany and its regional states , haunted by memories of World War Two and its aftermath , at first welcomed Bosnian war refugees with open arms , providing shelter and about 1,000 marks ( $ 590 ) per family per month . 
Berlin said it spent about 500 million marks a year to support its share of the 320,000 Bosnian refugees taken in by Germany &apos;s 16 regional states . 
facing budget crises , Berlin along with Germany &apos;s other states decided last October to begin forcing the refugees to leave unless they volunteered to go . 
Schoenbohm said only about 1,200 of the refugees in Berlin chose to go back last year after the war in Bosnia ended officially with the Dayton peace accord at the end of 1995 . 
other German states started forced repatriations last year . 
Berlin sent the first five refugees home last week . 
they included one convicted criminal and members of the &quot; phase one &quot; category of refugees -- single adults and married couples without children -- named to be deported first . 
asked why more people had not chosen to return , Schoenbohm said there was an uncertain situation in Bosnia combined with wishful thinking that Germany would not go ahead with the repatriations . 
&quot; One must understand that some people will not be welcomed back to their home towns with open arms , &quot; he said . 
critics of Germany &apos;s forced repatriation policy said Berlin was making a mistake and warned that those forced home were likely return to Germany illegally to avoid a still desperate situation in Bosnia . 
&quot; There is still a daily struggle for survival , &quot; said Ismail Kosan , a Greens parliamentarian of Turkish origin who sits on Berlin &apos;s municipal assembly . 
&quot; Deportation is not a solution . 
if Germany kicks them out of the door , they will return through the window -- that is , illegally .
