the stock market gave tape-watchers whiplash Thursday as prices tumbled in early trading on worries about rising interest rates but recouped nearly all the losses by the end of the first session of 1997 . 
stocks scored modest gains as trading got underway , reassuring some investors after the Dow Jones industrial average fell 101 points on Tuesday , the last session of 1996 . 
but the market promptly headed south after a report of robust manufacturing activity in December sparked a steep decline in the bond market , which in turn hurt stocks . 
the Dow industrials quickly fell 96 points , but stocks then wound their way higher during the rest of the session . 
stocks got a final boost from computer-driven buy programmes in the final minutes . 
the 30-share Dow closed with a loss of 5.78 points at 6,442.49 . 
analysts said the heavy early selling appeared to be an over-reaction made possible in part because so many traders and investor were still enjoying New Year &apos;s vacations . 
&quot; I thought it would take until next week for the market to rebound but I have a feeling a lot of people that weren &apos;t working decided to call in late and say , &apos; Start buying these things &apos; , &quot; said Robert Froehlich , chief investment strategist at Van Kampen American Capital . 
according to Birinyi Associates , which tracks programme trading , the late buy programme reversed 51 points in Dow losses in a mere 10 minutes and sharply cut the losses in the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s index of 500 stocks , which closed down 3.73 points at 737.01 after falling more than 11 points earlier . 
the report that sparked the sell-off came from the National Association of Purchasing Management , which said its index of maufacturing activity rose to 54.0 in December , the highest in six months , from 52.7 in November . 
a reading above 50 points to growth in manufacturing , while one below that level indicates contraction . 
the report signalled a pickup in the economy that could mean accelerating inflation and force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in a bid to control growth . 
the central bank has held rates steady since last January , when it cut rates to spur growth . 
the report was the first major indicator of the new year and had been widely awaited in financial markets . 
private economists had expected a reading of 51.5 for December . 
bonds skidded after the report . 
the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1-6 / 32 points , or $ 11.875 on a $ 1,000 bond , raising its yield to 6.74 percent from 6.64 percent on Tuesday . 
bond prices and yields move in the opposite direction . 
&quot; We just tested 6.75 percent but didn &apos;t finish over that and that helped , &quot; said Froehlich at Van Kampen American . 
bond yields approaching 7 percent tend to start drawing funds away from stocks . 
the steep drop in stocks on Tuesday followed reports of a strong rise in consumer confidence in December and the fastest growth in new home sales in November in 3-1 / 2 years . 
while Tuesday &apos;s drop was confined mostly to blue-chip issues , Thursday &apos;s decline moved into the broader market . 
financial and banking issues got hit hard by rising market interest rates , which raises their cost of funds . 
Citicorp lost 1 to 102 , Bankers Trust New York fell 1-1 / 2 to 84-3 / 4 and BankAmerica dropped 2-3 / 8 to 97-3 / 8 . 
on the New York Stock Exchange , 1,848 stocks fell and 786 rose on active volume of 461 million shares . 
technology stocks were another sector to suffer , hurt after retailer CompUSA Inc. reported anaemic sales growth in December . 
CompUSA shares fell 4-5 / 8 to 16 , a drop of 22 percent that triggered a wave of selling in the entire sector . 
Compaq Computer fell 2 to 72-3 / 8 , Intel lost 9 / 16 to 130-3 / 8 and Microsoft shed a point to 81-5 / 8 . 
analysts said even the selling affecting the high-tech stocks appeared to be over-done . 
stocks that benefit from a stronger economy got a boost from the purchasing managers &apos; data . 
USX-U.S. Steel Group rose 3 / 4 to 32-1 / 8 , General Motors climbed 2-3 / 4 to 58-1 / 2 and Aluminum Co. of America gained 1-3 / 8 to 65-1 / 8 . 
the NYSE composite index of all listed common stocks fell 2.77 points to 389.53 . 
the average share fell 29 cents . 
the American Stock Exchange index lost 3.18 to 569.16 . 
the Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE , American and Nasdaq issues -- stood at 7,147.803 , down 50.49 , or 0.7 percent .
