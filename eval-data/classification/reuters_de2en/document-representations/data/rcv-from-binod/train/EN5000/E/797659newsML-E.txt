German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said on Tuesday the country must do more to bolster its services sector to help counter the country &apos;s soaring unemployment . 
&quot; We have good quality in health services and other services , but we should be marketing it better , &quot; Rexrodt told reporters . 
services account for two-thirds of German jobs compared with three-quarters in the U.S. , Rexrodt said , a lag that could not be allowed to persist . 
&quot; We can see that services create jobs . 
Germany must catch up , and it will catch up . 
Germany &apos;s services sector employs 61.5 million workers , a 55 percent increase since 1970 , but similar jobs grew 90 percent in the U.S. and 65 percent in Japan in the same time period , Rexrodt said . 
and while the U.S. added 2.9 million industrial jobs between 1970 and 1995 , Germany lost 3.1 million , contributing to unemployment levels which are approaching postwar highs . 
Germany introduced in May a six-point action programme to promote services by strengthening the export sector , reorienting education , implementing more new communications technologies , encouraging entrepreneurs , and cutting back public services that compete with the private sector . 
Rexrodt said he could not put a monetary value on the action programme , which combines elements of many different initiatives , but that it was &quot; millions of marks &quot; .
