SIMEX Nikkei futures surged to a bullish close on Tuesday , fuelled largely by the Dow &apos;s record finish for the second straight session . 
the benchmark Nikkei 225 December contract gapped sharply up at the open on the back of strong gains in Chicago while Japan and SIMEX Nikkei markets were closed for a holiday on Monday . 
the December Nikkei closed 30 points off its intra-day high of 21,390 against a previous settlement at 20,880 . 
&quot; The market &apos;s very strong . 
we could easily see 21,500 , &quot; said a dealer with a European house , adding that the market was likely to consolidate around that level before heading towards its next target of 21,700 . 
he said the December Nikkei would be supported at 21,300 initially and at the more crucial level of 21,000 . 
a Japanese bank dealer said the the market was also being underpinned by the prospect of a lower house election in Japan next month . 
&quot; usually , the market goes up ahead of an election , &quot; he said .
