Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bouez said on Monday that peace talks with Israel cannot resume except on the basis of exchanging occupied Arab land for peace , a formula set at the 1991 Madrid peace conference . 
&quot; Up to this moment , the Israeli government is still adhering to headlines that are in total contradiction to what we have reached ( in Madrid ) , &quot; Bouez told reporters at Beirut airport before heading for Paris . 
&quot; Therefore , we cannot resume these negotiations except from the point they have reached , meaning the point of confirming the principle of land-for-peace or from the point of confirming the ( Israeli ) pullouts provided that the details or schedule of this activity is agreed upon , &quot; he added . 
the Madrid peace conference , which drew Arab and Israeli delegates to the negotiating table for the first time , set the formula of exchanging occupied Arab land for peace with the Jewish state as the basis for the Middle East peace process . 
peace talks between Lebanon and Israel are stalled over the issue of an Israeli pullout from a 15-km ( nine-mile ) -deep zone the Jewish state set up in south Lebanon to protect its northern border area against cross-frontier attacks . 
Bouez said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to impose his own vision of peace -- &quot; an imposed peace and a peace that departs from the context of the postulates that have been agreed &quot; . 
Bouez will hold talks during his week-long Paris visit with his French counterpart Herve de Charette on bilateral ties and the regional situation . 
he will also give a lecture on the latest developments in the Middle East peace talks .
