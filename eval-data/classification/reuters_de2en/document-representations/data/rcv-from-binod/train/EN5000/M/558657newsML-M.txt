Dubai gold traders and wholesalers on Sunday reported strong demand for the metal from major market India , which helped compensate for a downturn in the Gulf Arab emirate &apos;s own retail market . 
Dubai is a key distribution hub for India , a leading gold consuming nation . 
&quot; Indian demand is very strong . 
it is wedding season now and prices are low ... It will probably stay like this until the beginning of the monsoon in June , &quot; said a Dubai-based trader . 
Alhough Indian sub-continent bullion demand traditionally tails off during monsoons from June to September , traders said prices at current levels continued to fan demand there . 
buoyant Indian demand is expected to push Dubai &apos;s bullion imports to over 400 tonnes this year from 350 tonnes in 1996 , according to analysts . 
Dubai &apos;s imports in the first two months of this year ran at 102.4 tonnes , versus 47.55 tonnes in the same period in 1996 . 
import data for the first quarter of 1997 are expected to be released by the World Gold Coucil ( WGC ) in Dubai on Monday . 
a combination of relatively low bullion prices , political uncertainty in India and changes to Indian gold import regulations had all combined to increase the appetite there for gold from Dubai , traders said . 
Dubai &apos;s benchmark ten tola bar ( TT ) -- 3.746 ounces of 24 carat gold -- was quoted by traders at 4,705 dirhams ( $ 1,282 ) versus 4,730 dirhams a week earlier . 
on the international spot market gold was quoted late Friday at $ 340.00-50 an ounce . 
retail business in Dubai &apos;s gold souk had slowed after the end of a month-long government-sponsored shopping festival , traders said . 
the festival , which was heavily promoted by the local gold business , had led to an almost doubling of gold turnover to 7.8 tonnes for the period , according to the World Gold Council , a gold producer group which seeks to promote gold consumption . 
&quot; This is very conservative and is 80-90 percent higher than a normal period when every month we would see 4-4.5 tonnes , &quot; said D.V.
