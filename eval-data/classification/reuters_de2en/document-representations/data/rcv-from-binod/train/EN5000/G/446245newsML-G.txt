all three newly-promoted sides received a rude introduction to Russian premier league football on Monday when each lost their opening matches . 
forced to play their first &quot; home &quot; fixtures at neutral grounds in ice-free southern Russia after failing to install heated pitches , the trio of newcomers did not even have the consolation of improved gate receipts . 
first division champions Dynamo-Gazovik Tyumen lost 1-0 to Rostov with last season &apos;s premier league top scorer Alexander Maslov on target again . 
Shinnik Yaroslavl slumped to a 3-1 defeat against the revamped and financially rescued torpedo Moscow . 
Lithuanian Edgaras Yankauskas scored twice and torpedo &apos;s Brazilian striker Leonidas added a third . 
like new torpedo coach Alexander Tarkhanov , Yankauskas joined from CSKA Moscow along with much of the squad following a bitter close season split sparked by the arrival at the army club of sacked Zenit St. Petersburg trainer Pavel Sadyrin . 
Sadyrin &apos;s successor , former Soviet coach Anatoly Byshovets , also launched his season with a win thanks to a CSKA defector . 
Vladimir Lebed secured the points for Petersburg against newly-promoted Fakel Voronezh with a 55th minute goal . 
after the first round of games , last season &apos;s runners-up Alania sit on top of the table . 
they completed a 5-0 hammering of KamAZ in front of 36,000 home fans in Vladikavkaz on Sunday , with a hat-trick in the final quarter on his debut from Ukrainian striker Ivan Getsko , newly signed from Lokomotiv Nizhny Novgorod . 
Sadyrin &apos;s new-look CSKA went down 2-0 to city rivals dynamo Moscow , while a 12th-minute strike from 21-year-old Alexander Shirko was just enough to secure full points for injury-hit champions Spartak Moscow , away at Zhemchuzhina Sochi .
