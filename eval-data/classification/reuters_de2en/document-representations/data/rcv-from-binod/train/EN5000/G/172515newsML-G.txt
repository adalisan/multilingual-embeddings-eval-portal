at least five people were killed on Wednesday when a gas canister exploded in an apartment block in Petropavlovsk , northern Kazakhstan . 
another six people were missing . 
Kazakh emergency services , cited by Russia &apos;s Interfax news agency , said the blast occurred early in the morning on the top floor of a five-storey block in the industrial city close to the Russian frontier . 
a further 10 people were taken to hospital after the explosion , which destroyed the top two floors of the building , Interfax said . 
rescue work was continuing . 
gas canisters are increasingly common in the former Soviet Union in places where regular supplies of natural gas have been cut off due to unpaid debts .
