Zaire &apos;s ailing and embattled president , Mobutu Sese Seko , left France for home on Friday to try to salvage what remains of his crumbling authority . 
but Laurent Kabila &apos;s rebels , who have been fighting to topple him since October , rejected a truce-then-talks call from the veteran leader and said his return made no difference . 
&quot; We negotiate first , &quot; Kabila said on arrival in Zaire &apos;s third city of Kisangani , which fell to the rebels last weekend . 
&quot; He ( Mobutu ) always wants to buy time . 
but we will not play his game , &quot; rebel political commissioner Deo Bugera said there . 
at Kinshasa airport , there were soldiers but no crowds in contrast to Mobutu &apos;s triumphant December 17 homecoming . 
workmen rolled out a red carpet in spitting rain as lowering clouds threatened a downpour . 
Mobutu , 66 , who left hospital in Monaco on Wednesday after fresh cancer treatment , issued a statement on Thursday calling for a truce and a national council to find a peace settlement . 
he left Nice airport on a private jet and was expected in Kinshasa some time after 4 p.m. ( 1500 GMT ) . 
&quot; He will address the nation to mark his position clearly , &quot; his son Mobutu Nzanga told Reuters in Nice . 
&quot; My father remains an important player in the stability of Central Africa . 
but many ordinary Zaireans , eager for a change from three decades of poverty and hardship under Mobutu , are openly rallying to Kabila . 
residents of Kinshasa &apos;s poor districts openly welcome the prospect of his arrival in the capital . 
Kabila &apos;s Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire ( ADFL ) is advancing relentlessly across the sprawling and chaotic Central African nation , where central government control has long been notional in many places . 
under foreign pressure to agree a truce and talk , Kabila says only face-to-face talks with Mobutu can halt the fighting . 
Mobutu &apos;s son , Nzanga , said on Thursday that his father no longer ruled out talks with rebel leaders but wanted to involve the government , army and transitional parliament . 
&quot; His intention is to find a solution to the present crisis in consultation with parliament , the government and the military high command . 
Mobutu has spent most of his time in Europe since having prostate cancer surgery in August . 
he has dominated Zaire with a mixture of political acumen and military ruthlessness since seizing power in 1965 . 
he presented his proposed national council as a formula to find &quot; appropriate ways &quot; out of the crisis &quot; with all our brothers , without exclusion &quot; . 
the rebels were not the only ones unimpressed . 
&quot; He is sure to come with his usual confusion . 
everything is possible , a good move , a bad move and the worst possible move . 
but he will above all be thinking of himself , &quot; one senior government member said . 
the rebels took up arms in October in a dispute about Zairean nationality for an ethnic Tutsi minority , who form the core of Kabila &apos;s fighting force . 
an alliance of anti-Mobutu groups rallied around the cause . 
the rebel advance has fuelled fresh political squabbling within Zaire &apos;s political family as rivals keen not to lose out in any deal with Kabila jockey for position . 
France and the United States have , meanwhile , made contingency plans to evacuate their nationals from Zaire . 
France has sent troops and planes to nearby Gabon and Congo . 
Zaire Airlines suspended flights to the diamond capital of Mbuji-Mayi on Friday , blaming problems with unruly soldiers .
