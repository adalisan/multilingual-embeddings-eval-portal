U.S. stock index futures closed mostly higher after an afternoon of volatile , active trade ahead of options expirations on Friday , traders and analysts said . 
&quot; This is going to be one for the books , &quot; one stock analyst said about Friday &apos;s expiration of January options on equity indexes . 
&quot; Unless we see something in the earnings picture to rattle the market , stocks are headed higher , &quot; said Jeff Feeney , vice president at Smith Barney . 
positive corporate earnings fueled the Dow Industrials &apos; climb , as well as the Nasdaq and Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500s , analysts and traders said . 
the strong earnings scenario overshadowed the U.S. bond market , which sharpened losses throughout the day . 
U.S. bonds weakened in reaction to comments from Federal Reserve Governor Laurence Meyer , who said that consumer prices , excluding volatile food and energy , could rise in 1997 . 
U.S. bonds tumbled on the comments , and pushed March S &amp; Ps through the minor support level of 772.00 . 
&quot; locals really wanted to push the market lower , &quot; one trader said . 
before long , March S &amp; Ps fell through the pivot point of 771.90 and through Wednesday &apos;s settlement of 771.65 . 
however , the contract found good support at 769.20 . 
&quot; The resiliency is really remarkable , &quot; a floor trader said . 
Daniel Riley , director of institutional trading at Chicago execution Corp , said the market turned short-term oversold at the daily low . 
one large U.S. firm was a heavy buyer on the downside and an active seller on the upside . 
Feeney said Nasdaq 100 futures will be one of the closest indexes to monitor following Microsoft &apos;s earnings report . 
&quot; It &apos;s a great index to play against those two stocks , &quot; Feeney said , referring to Microsoft and Intel , which make up a third of the Nasdaq 100 index . 
at the end of pit trade , March S &amp; Ps were up 3.60 at 775.25 , NYSE composites were up 1.70 at 408.80 , KCBT Value Lines were 3.55 higher at 703.90 , Nikkeis were down 275.0 at 17,950 , Midcap 400s were 1.60 higher at 265.80 , and Nasdaq 100s rallied 12.45 to 883.60 .
