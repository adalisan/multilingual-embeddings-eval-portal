Guatemala will maintain relations with Taiwan despite pressure from China , which threatened to block a U.N. peacekeeping mission to monitor the end of Guatemala &apos;s long-running guerrilla war , Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein said on Wednesday . 
China has not agreed to support a United Nations Security Council resolution approving U.N. military observers for three months because of Guatemala &apos;s close ties with Taiwan , which Beijing considers a renegade province . 
&quot; Peace missions cannot be subject to this type of unilateral obstacle , &quot; Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein told reporters in an impromptu news conference . 
Chinese and Guatemalan envoys have been discussing the issue , Chinese diplomats said in New York . 
the United Nations recommended sending 155 peacekeepers to oversee disarmament provisions of a treaty signed in Guatemala on December 29 , that ended 36 years of civil war . 
Stein said he understood China was &quot; bothered &quot; that Guatemala invited Taiwan &apos;s foreign ministry to the peace signing ceremony in Guatemala City . 
&quot; In that respect Guatemala has nothing more to say . 
the government made a broad and open invitation to all the governments with which it maintains relations , &quot; Stein said . 
several diplomats believe Beijing will not veto the measure but is trying to wring some concessions from Guatemala -- perhaps a high-level visit and an eventual trade mission to wean the Central American country slowly from Taiwan . 
Guatemala receives considerable economic asssistance from Taiwan , which targeted several other poor Central American countries for aid and investment . 
in turn Central American countries have been firm backers of moves aimed at securing United Nations membership for Taiwan . 
Stein said the debate over the peacekeeping mission would not damage tentative contacts Guatemala had previously established with China in an effort to normalise relations . 
a similar pattern emerged each time U.N. peacekeepers for Haiti were due for approval . 
China threatened to veto the contingents because of Haiti &apos;s relations with Taiwan , but approval eventually was given for a reduced number of troops following visits to Haiti from Chinese envoys . 
more than 100,000 people died in Guatemala &apos;s conflict , the last in Central America , and a further 40,000 &quot; disappeared . 
&quot; During the war the army earned a reputation as the worst human-rights violator in the Americas . 
under military provisions of the peace accord , hammered out during five years of U.N.-brokered negotiations , troops from the rebel Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit ( URNG ) will move to eight assembly points where they will hand over weapons to Guatemalan and U.N. personnel . 
the unarmed U.N. military observers are to verify a ceasefire and patrol a security zone around each assembly point .
