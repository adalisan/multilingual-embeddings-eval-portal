U.S. economist ( corrects from presidential advisor ) Fred Bergsten said on Wednesday the dollar was way overvalued at its present level , particularly versus the yen and European currencies . 
&quot; The dollar is now way overvalued in long term fundamental terms , &quot; Bergsten , Director of the Institute for International Economics , told Reuters Financial Television from Singapore . 
Bergsten also said a dollar / yen rate around 100 would be a long term equilibrium level . 
he added a more correct level for dollar / mark would be in the 1.40 to 1.50 area at the present time . 
&quot; One can quite easily understand the strength of the dollar because the short term fundamentals are very bullish for it , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The U.S. economy is much stronger than Europe or Japan and U.S. interest rates are much firmer . 
so it &apos;s a clash between short term fundamentals which favour the dollar and longer term fundamentals which are quite negative for the dollar . 
Bergsten , a former U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Treasury , said at some point the dollar would turn around and come back down , possibly faster than it had risen . 
asked what would be a more natural level for dollar / yen , Bergsten said : &quot; Something around 100 is probably at this point a longer term equilibrium level . 
Bergsten said the fear of a weak euro replacing the mark was pulling money out of the German currency and other European currencies . 
&quot; When the euro gets started , it &apos;s bound to be a strong currency . 
Bergsten said there would be a European Central Bank devoted to price stability , it would not have any government &quot; looking over its shoulder &quot; and it would want to establish credibility as fast as possible . 
&quot; So I think the market view is erroneous and will be corrected when the market comes to see the realities of the European system . 
he said another possiblity was that the introduction of the single currency would be postponed and this would lead to a flow back into the mark . 
when asked what a more correct level for dollar / mark would be , Bergsten said : &quot; somewhere on the order of 1.40 to 1.50 at this point in time .
