as a furore grows over campaign fundraising , a Federal Election Commission member said on Thursday that spending for the 1996 presidential and congressional elections may reach a record $ 2.7 billion . 
Joan Aikens , the longest serving commissioner on the campaign monitoring group , gave that estimate at a forum at which lobbyists attacked campaign finance reform plans in Congress . 
she also revealed she would be leaving the agency soon , after 22 years . 
Aikens said spending for the 1996 election could be &quot; almost $ 2.7 billion &quot; but noted that despite the spending voter turnout in the November 1996 election was below 50 percent . 
by comparison , during the 1992 election cycle , some $ 2 billion was spent , according to the FEC . 
Aikens joined lobbyists at the meeting in criticising a bipartisan campaign reform bill in Congress sponsored in the Senate by Arizona Republican John McCain and Wisconsin Sen. Russell Feingold that calls for voluntary spending restraints and curbs on big money contributions . 
she said many of the provisions were unconstitutional and suggested that instead of limiting individual contributions -- now $ 1,000 for a primary and $ 1,000 for a candidate in the general election -- they should be raised . 
&quot; Contribution limits should all be raised and party limits should be raised drastically or removed entirely , &quot; she said . 
the commission was set up to monitor campaign financing after abuses during the Watergate scandal that drove President Richard Nixon from office . 
Aikens , a Republican , was the first person named to the commission in 1975 . 
&quot; I expect to leave the commission shortly after 22 years , &quot; she said . 
after participating in the campaign finance forum before the American League of lobbyists , Aitkens told Reuters she had not set a time for leaving but anticipated it would be when the White House sends a replacement for Senate confirmation . 
the six-person commission , equally divided among Republicans and Democrats , has three Democrats and two Republicans with one Republican vacancy . 
separately , New York financier Jerome Kohlberg Jr. announced that a group of top businessmen had joined his Campaign Reform Project to push campaign reform through Congress . 
&quot; By all accounts , this last campaign cycle has shown further disintegration in the current financing system , &quot; said Kohlberg in a statement . 
&quot; The rules are collapsing . 
&quot; The time is ripe for business leaders to stand up and help repair a broken system , &quot; said the founder of Kohlberg &amp; n Co. investment firm . 
he said businessmen joining as members of his project &apos;s business advisory council include Morton Meyerson , chairman of Perot Systems Corp. , Thomas Murphy , chairman emeritus of ABC , Inc . , Robert Bernstein , former president of Random House , Sanford Robertson , chairman of Robertson Stephens &amp; Co . , Richard Rosenberg , former chairman of Bank of America , P.Roy Vagelos , former chairman of Merck &amp; Co . , Inc . , and A.C. Viebranz , former senior vice president of GTE Corp.
