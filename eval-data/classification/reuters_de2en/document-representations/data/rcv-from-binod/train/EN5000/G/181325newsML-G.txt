outgoing U.S. ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale said on Monday that he saw some dark days during his more than three years here , as the two allies struggled to settle bitter trade feuds and rebuild frayed security ties . 
Mondale will retire from his post on December 15 , the likely end of a public career which began as Minnesota campaign manager for Harry Truman in 1948 , saw him elected vice president in 1976 and then lose the presidential race to Ronald Reagan in 1984 . 
&quot; I was never going to quit , I don &apos;t quit under pressure , &quot; Mondale said , reflecting on his time in Tokyo -- during which he dealt with four different Japanese prime ministers . 
&quot; But the days got pretty tough , &quot; he told a small group of journalists over breakfast . 
&quot; There was a time then when it was really quite dispiriting . 
some of those tough times came in 1995 when the two nations lurched to the brink of a trade war over access to Japan &apos;s car market , and then were pitched into a heated debate over security ties , frayed by end of the Cold War and jolted by the rape of a Japanese schoolgirl by U.S. servicemen . 
&quot; There were some tough times , particularly when the Okinawa thing happened . 
public outrage over America &apos;s big military presence on Japan &apos;s southern island of Okinawa was inflamed by the September 1995 rape of a local schoolgirl by U.S. servicemen . 
after a rocky period , Japan and the United States agreed at an April 1996 summit to draft a set of new military cooperation guidelines under the 1960 U.S.-Japan Security Treaty . 
they also unveiled a plan -- details of which remain to be worked out -- to cut back U.S. military bases on Okinawa . 
&quot; While trade gets the most publicity ... maybe the most important thing that happened in U.S.-Japan relations over the last 3-1 / 2 years has been the debate over the ... importance of the security relationship , &quot; Mondale said . 
&quot; We still have got work to do in Okinawa , but I do believe that over the last three years , after a period of uncertainty , there has developed a building consensus that will assure that we get these things done , &quot; he said . 
Mondale advised U.S. President Bill Clinton &apos;s team to strive to settle trade spats with Tokyo through diplomacy , but also to bear in mind how stubbornly the Japanese system can resist outside pressure to change . 
&quot; This is a serious business -- don &apos;t make disputes out of trivial things and try very hard to resolve issues diplomatically , &quot; he urged . 
&quot; At the same time , be mindful of the highly resistant and insular system that sometimes seems more powerful than the government itself . 
if Washington does decide to threaten trade sanctions , it must be willing to back words with actions if satisfactory deals are not forged , he said . 
&quot; I think you have to ( follow through ) , otherwise you will not be believed next time , &quot; Mondale said . 
disputes over insurance , construction and aviation loom , as well as one over consumer photo film which Washington has already taken to the Geneva-based World Trade Organisation . 
&quot; That could well be the first fight , &quot; Mondale said , referring to the insurance feud . 
the two sides have set a December 15 deadline for settling the dispute over U.S. demands that Tokyo open its primary insurance markets before freeing up its &quot; third-sector &quot; niche market , which U.S. firms dominate . 
and what of his long political career ? 
&quot; What I loved about politics in America was the vibrancy of it , the challenge of it , the excitement of being around people , the chase , the fight , seeing things get done when you were successful , the majesty of democracy ... and to be a part of it was thrilling .
