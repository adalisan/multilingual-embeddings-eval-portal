Taiwan on Monday said Tibet &apos;s exiled leader , the Dalai Lama , would be welcomed in Taiwan this week as a local citizen -- something likely to irk arch rival China as well as the Buddhist god-king himself . 
&quot; Tibet is a part of the Republic of China and the Dalai Lama is a republic national , &quot; said Chang King-yuh , head of the cabinet &apos;s policy-making mainland Affairs Council . 
&quot; He will not be treated as a state guest during his Taiwan trip , &quot; Chang said . 
Taiwan analysts said Chang seemed to be trying to play down the political tone of the Dalai Lama &apos;s visit -- but was likely to anger arch rival China and even the Tibetan monk . 
Tibetan Buddhism &apos;s top cleric has never acknowledged being a subject of the exiled Republic of China on Taiwan or the communist People &apos;s Republic of China that took power in 1949 . 
Beijing was likely to bristle over Chang &apos;s characterisation of the Dalai Lama as a national of the Nationalist Republic of China , whose civil war defeat came by the communists &apos; hand . 
Beijing characterises the 1989 Nobel peace laureate as a &quot; splittist &quot; seeking Tibet &apos;s independence from China . 
his scheduled March 22-27 Taiwan visit has already angered China , even more so after Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui said last week he hoped to meet the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader . 
Beijing , which assails Lee as a &quot; schemer &quot; who secretly plots Taiwan &apos;s formal independence from China , has warned Taiwan not to admit the Dalai Lama so as not to harm China &apos;s reunification and ethnic unity . 
Chang said the Dalai Lama &apos;s trip was a religious rather than political one , noting that the Dalai Lama &apos;s government in exile no longer advocated a unified church-state as it once did . 
&quot; Besides , from our point of view , Tibet has never become independent , &quot; Chang told parliament , expressing a view identical to that held by rival China . 
Beijing has alleged that the Dalai Lama &apos;s Taiwan visit has political motives . 
Taiwan &apos;s parliament has invited the Dalai Lama to address the body . 
advocates of Taiwan &apos;s independence from China have said they would seek to meet the Dalai Lama during his visit . 
the radical Taiwan Independence Party vowed to send hundreds of supporters to welcome the exiled leader at the airport . 
the Dalai Lama has accused Beijing of waging &quot; cultural genocide &quot; in Tibet and called for talks with China &apos;s leaders to secure political autonomy for the vast Himalayan region . 
the cleric fled Tibet after a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959 and has lived in exile in India ever since .
