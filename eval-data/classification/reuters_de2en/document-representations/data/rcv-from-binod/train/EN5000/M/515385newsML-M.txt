the Chinese yuan closed up at an intraday high of 8.2951 on Wednesday from Tuesday &apos;s 8.2959 against the U.S. dollar in Shanghai due to speculative buying in the last few minutes of trading , traders said . 
China &apos;s heavy foreign trade surplus in the first three months of this year added dollar supply to the market , helping push up the yuan today , they said . 
the weighted average price on Tuesday was 8.2961 . 
the yuan opened up at 8.2955 and moved between 8.2955 and 8.2959 for most of the session , hitting a low of 8.2960 late in trading before the speculative buying pushed it back up again . 
trading was active with most business done at about 8.2958 , traders said . 
one dealer said the size of China &apos;s foreign trade surplus in the first quarter continued to be a factor supporting the yuan . 
&quot; The speculative buying in the last few minutes was unexpected , but the yuan &apos;s movement overall proves it is still strong partly thanks to the foreign trade surplus , &quot; he said . 
China on Monday reported a trade surplus of $ 6.71 billion in the first three months of this year , up 25.7 percent year-on-year . 
a second dealer said the yuan &apos;s rise showed signs of faltering on Wednesday as it approached the 8.2950 resistance level . 
&quot; The market expects the central bank to intervene if the yuan breaches that level , &quot; he said . 
&quot; This has made it a strong psychological barrier for the yuan . 
dealers said they expected the yuan to consolidate on Thursday after rises over the past three days . 
the yuan closed little changed at 6.5610 from 6.5695 against 100 Japanese yen and unchanged at 1.0714 against the Hong Kong dollar .
