Germany &apos;s foreign ministry said on Monday it planned no further response to a mounting tide of criticism from Iran over a Berlin court case in which Tehran stands accused of killing Kurdish opposition leaders . 
spokesman Martin Erdmann said Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel had already told his Iranian counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati several times over the weekend by telephone that Bonn could not interfere in the trial . 
&quot; All we can do is explain the principles of our legal system again and again , &quot; he said . 
the opposition Social Democrats ( SPD ) supported Bonn &apos;s refusal to back down over the controversy with Iran , which has threatened to break off trade and diplomatic ties . 
foreign policy spokesman Freimut Duve said Bonn was right not to bend to pressure over the 1992 deaths of three Kurdish politicians and their translator at a Berlin restaurant . 
the prosecution last week accused Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and other Tehran officials of ordering the killings and demanded life sentences for the main suspects , an Iranian and a Lebanese man . 
&quot; If Iran wants to be accepted by the international community , it cannot have people killed abroad , &quot; Duve said . 
Bonn should also make clear to Tehran that much of the German investment in Iran is backed by official German government credit guarantees , he told ZDF television . 
in his calls to Velayati , Kinkel urged him to do everything possible to calm tensions between their countries and protect German nationals in Iran . 
about 5,000 Iranian students marched to Germany &apos;s embassy in Tehran on Sunday and threw eggs and tomatoes at the compound to protest against the prosecutor &apos;s accusations . 
Velayati told Iranian television : &quot; We will not compromise with anyone or anything over Islamic values and the values of the Islamic Republic of Iran . 
Germany was &quot; gravely mistaken &quot; if it thought Iran would ignore such an insult , Velayati said . 
Tehran has denied any role in the killings and officially protested on Thursday to Bonn over the charges . 
potentially at risk are trade ties worth $ 1.4 billion last year and Europe &apos;s &quot; critical dialogue &quot; with Iran -- championed by Kinkel as an alternative to U.S. sanctions aimed at isolating the Islamic republic .
