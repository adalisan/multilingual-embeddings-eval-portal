Steffi Graf faced the future Sunday and emerged intact as the undisputed champion of women &apos;s tennis . 
Graf showed there is no time like the present and made 16-year-old Swiss heir apparent Martina Hingis await her day on top of the mountain by crowning another spectacular season with a five-set win in the season-ending Chase Championships . 
Graf , 27 , overcame a season full of injuries and the deep emotional strain of her father &apos;s imprisonment on charges of evading taxes on her income with the kind of refuse-to-lose pride that beats in the hearts of the greatest champions . 
&quot; It &apos;s been a really long , long year , &quot; she said . 
as she did last year , Graf won all three Grand Slam events she played . 
she finished with a 54-4 match record , seven tournament titles and prize money of more than $ 2.6 million . 
&quot; In a way I &apos;m glad it &apos;s done , &quot; Graf said after her 6-3 4-6 6-0 4-6 6-0 victory over Hingis for a fifth Tour final championship title . 
&quot; It was so much more difficult physically to do it , &quot; added Graf , who struggled through foot , knee and back injuries to finish the season ranked first for the fourth year in a row . 
when her father Peter was finally freed from prison on bail 11 days ago in Germany after 15 months internment , Graf said she wished she could leave immediately for a reunion . 
but there was unfinished business -- defending her status in New York as queen of tennis . 
victory had to be all the sweeter as Graf ended Jana Novotna &apos;s streak of three straight tournament titles in the semifinals and then stopped the charge of rising star Hingis . 
Graf gave the fearless Hingis her due after their near three-hour battle . 
&quot; As fast as she is going , she &apos;s definitely the one to look out for , no question , &quot; Graf said of Hingis , who began the year ranked 16th and finished number four . 
&quot; The way she &apos;s been playing , without being afraid , with the freshness , I definitely see her as the one . 
Hingis did not qualify last year for the elite , 16-player field but was honoured here as most impressive newcomer . 
&quot; Last year I was watching the other players and now I reached the finals so it was like a little dream came true , &quot; said Hingis , whose bigger dreams involve Grand slams . 
Graf is not about to yield to anyone , but the German sees something special in Hingis . 
&quot; She can hit incredible angles . 
her down the lines are probably the best around in tennis . 
you don &apos;t see a lot of players play that game , it &apos;s usually mostly cross court , &quot; Graf said . 
&quot; And she &apos;s got a good view of the court . 
she &apos;s got a good sense where you &apos;re going to hit it . 
Hingis brings personality as well as power and brains to the court . 
when scheduled to play a late match , Hingis would sit out front in the VIP section at Madison Square Garden to watch the tennis , easily smiling and joking with her neighbours . 
on the court , her steely determination ruled , though the teenager betrayed her years with her blush , nervous smile and self-conscious tugging in reply to a chorus of wolfish whistles from coarse fans excited by the view afforded by her flying short skirt . 
Hingis , however , is confident of the course she is taking and the sky is the limit for the Slovakian-born star in the making . 
&quot; I think if I &apos;m going to play like this for the future , I will have a big chance to be higher and higher , &quot; said Hingis who won two tournaments after reaching the semifinals at the U.S. Open in September . 
&quot; Next year , I &apos;ll just try to play my best tennis and win a couple of tournaments . 
and I would like to win a Grand Slam next year , too . 
Graf , winner of 21 Grand Slam titles , has her own wish list . 
&quot; If I had a wish list for next year , it would be my health , that is my top priority , &quot; said Graf . 
I really need to find a way to get better and to feel better physically . 
&quot; That &apos;s absolutely the top priority , &quot; Graf said before perhaps drifting to thoughts of her father , home in Germany . 
&quot; Second is that life in general gets a little easier .
