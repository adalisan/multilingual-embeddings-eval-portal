Hungarian milling wheat futures closed mixed but mainly lower on Wednesday due to good crop outlooks and relatively low international prices , traders said . 
&quot; There are still many ( market players ) who are ready to sell at these prices , &quot; said Mihaly Otvos of OTP Forex Alkusz Kft . 
&quot; ( Hungary &apos;s and the region &apos;s ) crop may be the best in the past five to seven years , &quot; he added . 
&quot; In the world market prices are low too , and buyers are waiting . 
milling wheat futures maturing between August 1997 and January 1998 dropped by 150 to 350 forints per tonne . 
August finished at 22,540 forints , down 230 , while January eased 350 forints to 24,350 . 
the July and the May 1998 maturities bucked the trend , rising 200 forints to 22,900 , and 100 forints to 26,050 respectively . 
traders said July futures would soon mature and this triggered position closing in both milling wheat and maize futures . 
the rise in May futures was attributed to a number of deals in a contract with low liquidity . 
July maize ended up 310 forints at 20,660 . 
a trader said there were some 4,500 open contracts for July maize , while usually only 2,000 are delivered . 
they said blackseed ( sunflowerseed ) futures had been unusually active recently and on Wednesday contributed 77 lots to the Budapest commodity Exchange &apos;s total 616-lot or 318.4 million forint turnover . 
Blackseed attracted more interest because according to market talk the area sown was substantially smaller this year than in 1996 . 
( lot size = 20,000 kgs $ = 184.70 Hungarian forints )
