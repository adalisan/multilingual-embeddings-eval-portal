record imports and a trade deficit soaring to a nine-year high have kindled worries in the United States that Japan may be taking advantage of U.S. markets to export its way out of recession . 
the U.S. trade deficit soared in January to $ 12.71 billion , the highest level in nine years , the government reported last week . 
the reason for the rise , the second in a row , was record imports and declining exports , it said . 
the politically sensitive trade deficit with Japan edged up in January by 0.7 percent to $ 4.29 billion . 
the increase was smaller than the 40.8 percent jump in the U.S. deficit with China , which brought it to $ 3.72 billion for January . 
but the lackluster Japanese economy and the yen &apos;s weakness against the U.S. dollar have raised fresh concerns among many U.S. economists and some administration officials that the trade deficit with Japan will balloon in 1997 , wiping out hard fought gains made in recent years . 
&quot; I am concerned that Japan not think that it &apos;s going to export its way out of this recession , particularly with respect to significant increases in exports to the United States , &quot; U.S Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told reporters on Friday . 
she said the issue has been the subject of &quot; some discussion &quot; between U.S. and Japanese officials . 
Barshefsky did not speak directly to the yen / dollar issue , only Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is allowed to do that . 
but her remarks weighed on currency markets as did a report that Federal Reserve Vice President Alice Rivlin said Rubin has set limits on his strong dollar policy . 
the Fed , though , denied the report on Rivlin &apos;s remarks . 
U.S. manufacturers , particularly the Big Three carmakers , have been voicing deep concern about the weak yen and strong dollar for some time , arguing that it was making U.S. good too costly and Japanese goods too cheap . 
&quot; The predictions of the past six months are now , unfortunately , coming true , &quot; American Automobile Manufacturers Association President Andrew Card said in the association &apos;s latest report on trade with Japan . 
&quot; In February , U.S. sales were down for America &apos;s car companies , and up for Japanese automakers , reflecting the tremendous increase in auto exports from Japan resulting from the undervalued yen , &quot; he said . 
Lawrence Chimerine , a senior economist with the Economic Strategy Institute think tank , said he believes the U.S. trade deficit with Japan will rise dramatically this year , after declining for two years in a row , reflecting an earlier decline in the value of the dollar against the yen . 
but since then the yen has weakened and the dollar &apos;s value soared by about 55 percent since the spring of 1995 to around 123 yen currently , making Japanese goods less costly and U.S.-made goods more expensive . 
&quot; Through the ( 1996 ) election , the administration was happy that the dollar was strengthening because the Japanese central bank was buying a lot of dollar assets , helping keep interest rates down in the United States , &quot; Chimerine said . 
&quot; This was the main concern before the election , &quot; he added . 
&quot; Now they ( administration officials ) are focusing more on ( the dollar &apos;s strength ) because they are starting to see how much the trade deficit is starting to go up . 
you are going to see more concern by the administration I think . 
because it can take as much as a year or two for the impact of the strong dollar to work its way through the economy , the worst is yet to come for the U.S. trade picture , said Norwest Corp. chief economist Sung won Sohn . 
&quot; When administration officials said , &apos; We want a strong dollar , &apos; I hope they understood that one of the economic consequence is that we redistribute economic growth from the United States to Japan and Europe , &quot; Sohn said . 
&quot; The Japanese are obviously taking advantage of every opportunity associated with the strong dollar .
