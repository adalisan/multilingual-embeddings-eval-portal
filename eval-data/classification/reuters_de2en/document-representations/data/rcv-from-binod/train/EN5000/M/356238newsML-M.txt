most IMM currency futures finished pit trading lower , with the yen slumping to sizable daily losses as sterling rallied to even-bigger gains . 
most futures pulled back late as some intraday longs wiggled out after currencies barely wobbled following the widely expected decision by the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) to leave U.S. interest rates steady . 
the U.S. discount rate remained at five percent , and the overnight Federal funds rate target stayed at 5.25 percent . 
&quot; It was pretty much in-line , &quot; said one floor analyst of the lack of U.S. rate action . 
sterling bounced upward at the expense of European units and especially of the beleaguered March yen , which slumped to a new contract low at $ 0.008120 before midday as the pound rallied to its session peak . 
yen fell sharply as worries revived about the stability of Japan &apos;s banking sector and the country &apos;s weak economy . 
Nippon Credit Bank overnight denied persistent market rumors that it is on the verge of collapse . 
the 23.4-percent rise in Japan &apos;s customs-cleared trade deficit in the first 20 days of January versus the year-ago period kept yen under pressure as well , brokers said . 
sterling bounded higher , hurdling resistance in the cash cross at 200 yen . 
it had only briefly reduced gains after the Bank of England left official interest rates unchanged at 6.0 percent after Wednesday &apos;s monetary policy meeting between BoE governor Eddie George and U.K. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke . 
sterling also continued to garner support from its distance from European Monetary Union anxiety and sentiment that the U.K. economy is chugging along strongly enough to foster a rate hike eventually , possibly following the U.K. election . 
traders shifted focus to Friday &apos;s U.S. January jobs data and Saturday &apos;s Group of Seven meeting in Berlin . 
yen settled down $ 0.000088 at $ 0.008126 , marks eased $ 0.0008 to $ 0.6085 , Swiss francs fell $ 0.0007 to $ 0.7034 , sterling rallied $ 0.0184 to $ 1.6390 , Canadian dollar dipped $ 0.0001 to $ 0.7462 , Aussie dollar lost $ 0.0012 to $ 0.7622 , and Mexican peso gained $ 0.000150 to $ 0.125625 .
