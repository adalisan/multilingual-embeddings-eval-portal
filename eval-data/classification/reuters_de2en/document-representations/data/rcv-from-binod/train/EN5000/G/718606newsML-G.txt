people who have had cancer and have close relatives who have also had it are much more likely to develop a second cancer , French researchers said on Friday . 
Sabine Kony and colleagues at the Institut Gustave Roussy in Villejuif said their findings indicated there is a genetic reason for people coming down with second cancers after being treated for a first one . 
radiotherapy seems to also play a role , they said -- something that other research supports as x-rays are known to cause cancer . 
&quot; Both genetic factors and exposure to ionising radiation have independent effects on the risk of SMN ( second cancer ) , &quot; Kony &apos;s group wrote in a report in the Lancet medical journal . 
they looked at 25 children who had a second tumour after treatment for cancer and 96 who had not developed a second cancer . 
those with close relatives who also had cancer were four to seven times more likely to get a second tumour , they said . 
chemotherapy did not seem to affect the risk of a second cancer , they found . 
children treated for cancer who have a family history of the disease should get a particularly vigilant follow-up , they recommended .
