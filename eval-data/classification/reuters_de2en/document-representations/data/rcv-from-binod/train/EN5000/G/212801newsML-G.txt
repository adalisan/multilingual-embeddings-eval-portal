armed attackers killed nine people , mostly women and children , in a village in South Africa &apos;s Eastern Cape region , police said on Sunday . 
up to 40 men stormed the Ntsikwe village late on Saturday , armed with an assortment of weapons including automatic rifles and pistols . 
they killed nine people , wounded eight and gutted some 30 houses . 
police told state radio the violence was believed to be a revenge attack following the gutting of five houses at nearby Sigikeni village on Friday night , linked to feuding over stock theft in the impoverished former black homeland of Transkei .
