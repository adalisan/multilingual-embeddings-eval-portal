international Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus delivered an upbeat assessment of the outlook for the world economy on Monday . 
in a speech to the IMF &apos;s Interim Committee , he evinced little concern about present currency rates , although he said he saw the need for further steps by the United States and Britain to prevent economic overheating . 
&quot; Exchange rates among the major currencies are generally consistent with broader policy objectives , &quot; the IMF chief said . 
the U.S. and Britain have benefitted from the strength of their currencies , which has helped contain inflation . 
Camdessus though said he still saw the risk of higher inflation in both countries . 
&quot; Several countries that have reached an advanced stage in their current expansion , including the United States and the United Kingdom , are facing risks of overheating and a need for further pre-emptive policy restraint , &quot; the IMF chief said . 
echoing the IMF &apos;s World Economic Outlook report released last week , Camdessus said the global expansion was likely to continue this year and next . 
&quot; There are few signs of the tensions and imbalances that usually foreshadow significant downturns , &quot; he said . 
the outlook has improved in continental Europe and Canada and the recovery in Japan is expected to continue at a moderate pace , Camdessus said . 
&quot; Stronger growth during the period ahead should make it easier for the European Union to stick to the timetable for EMU ( European monetary union ) , &quot; he added . 
he noted though that both Europe and Japan face what he called &quot; serious structural weaknesses &quot; in their economies that have yet to be satisfactorily addressed .
