U.S. Defence Secretary William Cohen arrived in Brussels on Friday and went straight into talks with NATO ambassadors on alliance attempts to strike a deal with Russia over its planned eastward enlargement . 
Cohen , who is on his first European trip since his nomination by President Bill Clinton , was greeted at NATO &apos;s headquarters by Secretary-General Javier Solana . 
Solana holds a fresh round of talks with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow on Sunday . 
diplomatic efforts to reach agreement with Russia on a new post-Cold War security relationship have intensified in recent weeks ahead of a March 21 summit between Presidents Clinton and Boris Yeltsin in Helsinki . 
on Thursday , the top U.S. negotiator with Russia , Strobe Talbott , also met NATO &apos;s 16 ambassadors before flying to Moscow to meet Primakov who himself visits Washington after meeting Solana on Sunday . 
Russia remains opposed to NATO &apos;s plans to invite some former communist countries to join the alliance next July but says it wants to try to reach a compromise over the issue which is now the number one U.S. foreign policy objective . 
Cohen arrived in Brussels from Rome where he held talks with Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini on a possible solution to a row with France over who should command NATO forces in southern Europe . 
Dini said after the talks he was confident France would accept a compromise to defer any decision for five years , enabling Paris to continue with its policy of gradual reintegration into NATO &apos;s military structures . 
the row which goes to the heart of plans to create a European identity within the U.S.-dominated Atlantic Alliance had threatened to scupper hopes of combining enlargement with an overhaul of the alliance &apos;s internal structures .
