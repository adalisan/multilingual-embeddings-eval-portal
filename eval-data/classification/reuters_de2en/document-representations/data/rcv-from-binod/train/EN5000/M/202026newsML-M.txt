Monte Carlo-based AIC , the main short on the November IPE gas oil futures contract , plans to issue a statement about the delivery on Thursday but had no immediate comment on the situation late on Wednesday , an AIC trader said . 
the trader said the company would probably be in a position to quantify and assess the delivery at around mid-morning on Thursday . 
a duel between AIC and the main long , Swiss-based Cargill International SA , on the November contract involves the bulk of the record 865,1000 tonnes delivery due between November 16-30 on the Rotterdam region barge market . 
AIC says Cargill has been excessively slow to take delivery between November 16-20 , the first of three five-day delivery periods which ends at midnight on Wednesday . 
Cargill has declined to comment on the AIC charges but the accusations have been strongly dismissed by traders familiar with Cargill &apos;s position . 
IPE chief executive Lynton Jones said earlier the exchange was closely monitoring the delivery of the November gas oil contract to ensure performance by the dominant short and long . 
traders say that if either or both parties on an IPE futures delivery is accused of defaulting the exchange normally convenes an arbitration between the two and the defaulting party is required to compensate the counterparty . 
traders have said Cargill had established a large long position in November gas oil futures , betting that AIC , which has a large short position , would not be able to deliver into its commitments and therefore buy back its position at a higher price .
