Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram has dismissed criticism from the International Monetary Fund and U.S. credit rating agency Moody &apos;s , saying the IMF offers only &quot; textbook &quot; advice and Moody &apos;s was wrong . 
Chidambaram was asked in an interview at the weekend to comment on an IMF report that said India could face a debt crisis unless it made deeper cuts in the fiscal deficit . 
&quot; That &apos;s out of a textbook . 
running a government cannot be according to a textbook , &quot; he said . 
the report by IMF economists , released last week , said that unless red ink was brought under stricter control , debt and interest payments could spiral upwards , leading to wider current account deficits and deteriorating debt indicators . 
&quot; I visualise a scenario where we will make a fiscal correction as rapidly as possible , control inflation and maintain price stability , at the same time stimulate growth as well as appropriate large amounts of money for social sector programmes . 
asked if he was saying the IMF was not attuned to realities in India , the finance minister said : &quot; IMF &apos;s dharma ( belief ) is to read out of textbooks . 
the IMF helped India out of an economic crisis in the early 1990s but has been the object of some criticism , especially by the communist and right-wing Hindu parties , for allegedly dictating tough reform policies to New Delhi . 
the IMF argues that without adjustment policies , strained economies will reach a breaking point . 
Chidambaram was also asked to comment on a report last week by Moody &apos;s that stirred criticism by some Indian politicians . 
the credit rating agency said India &apos;s unstable political environment , directionless economic policies and a deterioration in its macroeconomic balances had led Moody &apos;s to take an unfavourable outlook on the nation &apos;s sovereign rating . 
I mean whoever gave them the inputs must have given it to them at least four months ago , &quot; Chidambaram said . 
&quot; It is quite evident that Moody &apos;s did not even take into account the budget , &quot; he said , referring to the tax and spending blueprint for fiscal 1997 / 98 ( April-March ) which he presented to parliament last month and drew widespread praise . 
Moody &apos;s , which upgraded India &apos;s rating from Ba2 to Baa3 in December , 1994 , recently assessed potential pressure on the rating over an 18- to 24-month horizon .
