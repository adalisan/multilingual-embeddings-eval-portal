thousands of Belgrade students ended 106 days of daily protests on Friday after their diehard rector resigned and celebrated victory by surrounding Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic &apos;s office shouting &quot; You Are Next &quot; . 
&quot; Now that my demand for the students to return to classes has been fuflfilled ... 
I am tendering my resignation , &quot; Belgrade University rector Dragutin Velickovic told state media . 
the students had offered to end the marathon protest and return to classes on Friday if Velickovic stepped down . 
he in turn said he would resign only when they returned to classes . 
massive demonstrations by Serbia &apos;s Zajedno ( Together ) coaliton of opposition groups drawing up to 500,000 at their peak forced Milosevic to restore local election victories in 14 cities which his ruling socialist party ( SPS ) had annulled . 
the widespread protests were the biggest challenge to Milosevic &apos;s 10-year rule . 
the students had demanded free access to the media which the SPS , fighting to reinstate its battered popularity ahead of presidential and parliamentary polls later this year , was loath to concede . 
some 40,000 students and opposition supporters later marched through Belgrade and encircled Milosevic &apos;s office although it was unclear whether he was in the building . 
they chanted &quot; Slobo , you are next , &quot; &quot; Red bandits &quot; and &quot; Slobo , You must Go &quot; . 
one student jumped on to a balcony and hoisted a Serbian flag . 
with no end to the marathon protest in sight , university deans loyal to the students had pressed them to test Velickovic &apos;s promise to resign by returning to their faculties . 
the Serbian government had warned them it would cut off university funding unless classes resumed . 
the student protests had continued even after an opposition coalition ended three months of mass demonstrations in February . 
the students carried on marching for press freedom and demanding the resignation of the rector , a diehard SPS appointee who had condemned their demonstrations for what he saw as siding with his political foes . 
Velickovic &apos;s resignation took most students by surprise . 
&quot; I am very surprised and did not expect such an action , a moral act by a man who had not acted very morally in the past months , &quot; Cedomir Antic , a student organiser , told Reuters . 
the almost four months of daily peaceful and highly imaginative protests appeared to have taken a heavy toll , resulting in cracks in the unity of the student leaders . 
Antic resigned on Thursday as protest board chairman over the controversy created by the decision to return to classes , which deeply divided the student movement . 
many students believed they were being betrayed and that Velickovic will not resign . 
they also note that their demand for press freedom has not been met . 
&quot; I feel defeated ... because I think there is no real victory , &quot; Tanja Milovanovic , a member of student protest main board told Reuters . 
but the students said the end of their daily marches did not mean they would stop applying pressure on Milosevic . 
&quot; Our goals were moderate . 
some goals remain , we will see how we will fight for them , &quot; Antic said . 
students later said they would not attend classes on Monday but assemble at their faculties to decide what to do next , said organising committee member Sasa Mihajlov . 
independent Belgrade BK Television said on Thursday evening it had been barred by Milosevic &apos;s Serbian Radio Television ( RTS ) network from broadcasting outside Belgrade . 
BK TV saw the move as the &quot; most flagrant attack on media freedom in Serbia restricting citizens &apos; right to be informed &quot; . 
Zajedno said it will devote its Sunday protests , commemorating the 6th anniversary of massive anti-government demonstrations in Belgrade in which two people were killed , to the struggle for press freedom in Serbia .
