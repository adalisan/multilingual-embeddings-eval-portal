the Lithuanian finance ministry is considering the issue of just one eurobond this year rather than the two it has said it may launch , a senior finance ministry official said on Wednesday . 
the country has already said it intends to launch a $ 200 million deal later this year . 
&quot; There is a good chance we might only issue one bond this year , &quot; Ruta Skyriene of the finance ministry &apos;s international department told Reuters at a conference on investing in the Baltic states , organised by Euromoney , in the Swedish capital . 
she said the ministry was working on a medium-term borrowing policy , which had the goal of reducing debt . 
this policy may also involve the reduction of the number of state guarantees issued for loans taken by state entities .
