wet Brent markets were quiet in early trade on Wednesday with premiums still under pressure from an overhang of prompt June barrels , traders said . 
markets showed little reaction to last night &apos;s American Petroleum Institute inventory data which brokers said were mostly neutral . 
Inter-month spreads on the cash market were steady to a shade weaker , July / August losing a cent to trade at -32 cents . 
short-term swaps were slightly weaker . 
bids for contract for differences for June 11-13 against August Brent slipped five cents to - $ 1.00 , while June 16-20 was steady against August at -80 / -74 cents , brokers said . 
although outright values were showing some recovery from year-lows hit late on Tuesday the weight of unsold cargoes and a tight transatlantic arbitrage were keeping things bleak for North Sea sellers . 
&quot; There are still lots of June grades , including Brent , not yet committed with no end-users buying and refiners already committed , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; Most probably premiums will drop again . 
mild relief might come in the form of buying for storage to take advantage of the steep price contango but some traders questioned how much tankage was available . 
in late trades on Monday a 24-26 June loading Oseberg was heard done at dated Brent -10 cents , 5 cents weaker than earlier that day . 
two late June loading Ekofisk cargoes were traded at dated even .
