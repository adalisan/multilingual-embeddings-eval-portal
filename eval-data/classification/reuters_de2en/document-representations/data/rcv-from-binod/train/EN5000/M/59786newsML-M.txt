Hong Kong stocks ended firmer on Tuesday and the Hang Seng index hit its highest close since February 1994 , buoyed by Wall Street &apos;s highs and the view that a near-term rate hike would not hit stocks hard , brokers said . 
&quot; With precious little news on the domestic front , Hong Kong remains tied to the U.S. interest rate outlook -- which now looks limited to a 0.25 percent hike , &quot; said James Osborn , sales director at ING Barings . 
the Hang Seng Index closed up 53.71 points , 0.46 percent , at 11,621.61 , off a peak of 11,645.35 . 
the blue-chip barometer last closed higher at 12,157.57 on February 4 , 1994 .
