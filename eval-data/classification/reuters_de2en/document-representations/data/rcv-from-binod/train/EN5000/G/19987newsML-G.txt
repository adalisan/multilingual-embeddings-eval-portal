Democrats nominate President Bill Clinton for a second term on Wednesday , after heaping praise on him as a man of compassion who has created jobs , defended the weak , helped families and protected the environment . 
at the halfway point of the Democratic convention , polls are showing Clinton once again beginning to stretch his lead over Republican nominee Bob Dole . 
the lead was down to five points or less in some surveys immediately after the Republican convention of two weeks ago . 
but an ABC poll on Tuesday showed Clinton &apos;s advantage among registered voters back at 15 percentage points , a jump of five points between Sunday and Tuesday . 
that was without taking into account another day of barnstorming campaigning by Clinton as he rode a train across the American heartland on his way to Chicago , spilling new policy initiatives along the way . 
he will arrive in this lakeside city in time for the traditional roll call of states nominating him for a new four-year stint in the White House . 
the convention will also hear from Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday . 
the president &apos;s path has been prepared by dozens of speeches highlighting his record , none more passionate than First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton who lovingly recalled how her husband sat with her as she gave birth to their daughter Chelsea 16 years ago . 
it was a speech designed to dispel persistent character doubts about both Clintons , spawned by years of allegations about complex financial shenanigans in Arkansas , presidential womanizing and White House croneyism and misuse of power . 
watched by her 16-year-old daughter , no longer the awkward , gangly kid with braces Americans met four years ago , Mrs Clinton made the case for Clinton as the loving husband of 21 years and advocate of family values . 
&quot; For Bill and me , there has been no experience more challenging , more rewarding and more humbling than raising our daughter , &quot; said Mrs Clinton . 
to safeguard the future of America &apos;s children , she said , &quot; It takes a president who believes not only in the potential of his own child but of all children , who believes not only in the strength of his own family but of the American family ... 
&quot; It takes Bill Clinton , &quot; she said to a thunderous ovation . 
civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and former New York Governor Mario Cuomo gave Clinton a seal of approval on behalf of the party &apos;s once dominant liberal wing , despite their deep disagreement with some of his centrist policies . 
both said they objected to Clinton &apos;s decision to sign a Republican-inspired welfare reform bill than ended a 60-year-old guaranteed safety net for the poor . 
but still they urged the party to rally around the president . 
&quot; We disagree on a critical issue like welfare . 
but then if we elect him ( Clinton ) there is another day and a better day , &quot; Jackson said . 
Cuomo appeared as the defeated governor of New York , displaced by a Republican in the election debacle of 1994 , that lost both Houses of Congress for the Democrats . 
once seen as the Democrats &apos; great hope , he clearly recognised that the party &apos;s future now belonged to Clinton and his more conservative politics . 
&quot; In the end , Bill Clinton spells hope and the Republicans spell disaster , &quot; he said . 
Indiana Governor Evan Bayh , a cautious technocrat , gave Democrats a glimpse of their possible future , delivering a measured keynote address that defended Clinton for signing the welfare legislation . 
&quot; President Clinton understands that welfare was intended to be temporary , make work possible , &quot; he said . 
&quot; And across America he has made that happen . 
Bayh &apos;s speech was a testament to the virtues of competence . 
it was virtuous , but dull and received nothing like the rapturous response evoked by Cuomo and Jackson .
