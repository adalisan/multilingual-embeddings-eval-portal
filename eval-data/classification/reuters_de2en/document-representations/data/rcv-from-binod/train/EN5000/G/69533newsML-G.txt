solid political support combined with steady progress on nuts-and-bolts issues have put a common European Union currency on a near irreversible course towards becoming legal tender in 1999 , EU officials said Sunday . 
at a weekend gathering of EU finance ministers and central bank governors in Dublin , broad agreement was reached on three critical areas of economic and monetary union ( EMU ) . 
a Stability Pact designed to ensure spending discipline among governments inside EMU , a new Exchange Rate Mechanism ( ERM ) linking the Euro currency to those not participating and greater legal certainty for banks and businesses in advance of the 1999 start date all received a solid push forward . 
&quot; This meeting has been one of the most productive we have attended , &quot; Bank of France Gov. 
Jean-Claude Trichet told a news conference on Saturday . 
although important details remain unresolved , particularly on the Stability Pact , there was a strong commitment to have much of the remaining work completed when EU leaders meet here in December for a summit . 
the momentum behind the project , which has been punctuated by occasional periods of doubt and scepticism , appeared to owe much to the close partnership between France and Germany . 
the two countries , whose participation in EMU is seen as essential , have shown a remarkable degree of political will and cooperation at a time their economies have laboured under the weight of high unemployment and poor growth . 
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel , the spark behind the Stability Pact , came away from the gathering relatively pleased at the progress his colleagues made in nailing down the details of a mechanism expected to instill budgetary discipline . 
we are following exactly on the road we started on one year ago , &quot; Waigel said after the meeting . 
indeed Waigel &apos;s plan to sanction EMU members which run budget deficits above 3 percent of total output was given less than an even chance of success only nine months ago , when EMU itself appeared to be little more than wishful thinking . 
a summit of EU leaders in Madrid last December set in motion a powerful push towards monetary union which over the past several months appears to have gained speed and credibility . 
even Britain , still mired in doubt and internal bickering over whether it should join EMU , seems to have recgonized that its continental partners are determined to forge a single currency among at least six to eight countries . 
&quot; I get the feeling ever more clearly that it is going to go ahead , &quot; said the strongly pro-European British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke . 
while risks still remain , particularly on the economic front and in the period between when EMU participants are chosen -- early 1998 -- and the start date on Jan . 1 , 1999 , there is a growing sense that the political determination of Germany and France will see the thing through . 
work on technical aspects of EMU is expected to accelerate between now and December , with the European Commission and the EU &apos;s monetary committee , a group of national treasury and central bank officials , taking the lead role . 
on the Stability Pact , the committee was asked to specify more clearly &quot; extraordinary &quot; economic circumstances under which a country with an excessive deficit would be let off the hook . 
they also have to settle on how much a government would be fined should it fail to put its finances in order , and a deadline for doing so . 
EU officials said a consensus of around nine months appeared to be emerging . 
the European Monetary Institute , forerunner to a European Central Bank , won high marks for its vision of a new ERM , a voluntary arrangement with the Euro linked to non-EMU currencies in relatively wide and flexible bands . 
a legal regulation to guarantee banks and businesses that their obligations drawn up in national currencies would be respected after the start of EMU , was seen emerging in the next few months .
