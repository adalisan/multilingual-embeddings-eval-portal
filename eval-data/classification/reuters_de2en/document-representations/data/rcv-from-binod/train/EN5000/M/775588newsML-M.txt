Asia &apos;s heavy sweet crudes weakened on thin Japanese demand , traders said on Monday . 
but trading remained focused on the Middle East crudes , which were supported by news of lower official prices . 
parcels of September Oman traded to majors on Friday around MPM -3 / 4 cents per barrel . 
this was before the release of the July Oman official MPM price , which saw a narrowing of Oman &apos;s premium over Dubai to 11 cents , from 47 cents in June . 
although traders were confident of a narrower premium , they expected it to be around 25 cents , and were pleasantly surprised . 
this should keep Oman levels supported , but September Oman trading is almost finished , with only a western trader , a Chinese trader and a European major heard holding cargoes . 
around four cargoes of Abu Dhabi crudes are still on offer for September , with sellers looking at ADNOC + 10 cents for Murban and ADNOC + 15 for Lower Zakum . 
in the Asian crude market , a western trader confirmed looking to sell a September cargo of Tapis , but was not showing any firm offer yet . 
discussion for August Minas was also sharply lower at ICP + 25 , compared to the last trade heard done around ICP + 40 , and early August deals at + 75 .
