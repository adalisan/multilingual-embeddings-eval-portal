Indian health workers began vaccinating some 125 million children on Saturday in the second phase of the most ambitious chapter of a worldwide campaign to eradicate the crippling disease polio by the year 2000 . 
organisers said some two million health workers at 500,000 centres across India were expected to take part in the immunisation programme , believed to be the most ambitious public health event in a single day in the history of any country . 
Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda launched Saturday &apos;s campaign , administering two drops of oral polio vaccine to children on the lawn outside his official residence in the capital . 
in remote regions of the western state of Rajasthan , volunteers planned to use camels to deliver the vaccine . 
in the hills of the southern state of Tamil Nadu , the medicine was to be brought by health workers on foot . 
in December 1995 and last January , an estimated 93 million children up to three years of age were innoculated . 
the second phase of the three-year programme was to be spread over two days , Saturday and next January 20 , and cover some 125 million children up to age five . 
the two sessions were to be repeated a third and last time in late 1997 and early 1998 . 
the Indian effort was part of a global drive to wipe out poliomyelitis , an infectious viral disease that strikes the central nervous system and can cause temporary or permanent paralysis . 
it has already been eradicated in the Americas . 
children are especially vulnerable to the illness , which is transmitted by human excrement . 
the disease thrives in the hot , congested conditions common in the Indian subcontinent , according to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) . 
health Secretary J.C. pant said 742 cases of polio had been reported in India in the first nine months of 1996 , compared with 2,643 for the same period in 1995 . 
&quot; The results of last year &apos;s campaign are very encouraging , &quot; he said . 
since the global eradication drive was launched in 1988 , the number of reported cases has fallen by more than 80 percent , to 6,200 from 31,000 . 
but the WHO estimates that for every documented case , nine go unreported , with two thirds of them in Bangladesh , India and Pakistan . 
the polio virus still circulates in some 70 countries . 
recently there have been outbreaks in Chechnya , Pakistan and Zaire , according to Rotary International , which expects to have spent $ 400 million on the eradication project by 2000 .
