Irish Prime Minister John Bruton said on Monday he believed that there was a growing body of opinion within the Irish Republican movement that rejected the use of violence . 
&quot; I believe that there is a strong internal debate taking place in the Republican movement and the policy of violence is being re-assessed and there is a growing recognition that violence is not a way of solving problems , &quot; Bruton said . 
&quot; I am hopeful that the result of that debate will be a ceasefire that on this occasion will hold in all circumstances , &quot; Bruton told a news conference during a brief visit to Lisbon to prepare for a European Union summit in Dublin next month . 
&quot; The policy of violence has disunited the Irish people more than it has ever been disunited , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It has caused a degree of inter-communal strife in Northern Ireland that we haven &apos;t seen in generations , &quot; he added . 
the British and Irish governments insist on a new truce before all-party talks on British rule in Northern Ireland can begin .
