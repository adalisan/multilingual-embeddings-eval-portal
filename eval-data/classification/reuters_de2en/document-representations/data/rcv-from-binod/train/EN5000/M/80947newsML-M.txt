LIFFE cocoa futures nudged up slightly by the close in brisk trade boosted by crosses and switches but there were very little outrights , traders said . 
in the absence of fresh fundamental inputs , activity turned to spread trading . 
&quot; There have been a lot of March / March and May / May crosses which inflated the volume , &quot; said one trader . 
March 1997 / March 1998 was seen traded at 60 stg and May / May at possibly 64 stg . 
traders said the December / March spread was also active , trading at around 24 stg by the close . 
the bulk of the deals were seen in the last hour of trading . 
overall volume reached a hectic 7,402 lots , up sharply from around 3,000 lots a day in the past few sessions . 
by the finish , most-active March was three stg firmer at 1,016 stg a tonne while December also rose three stg to 992 . 
on Thursday , second-position December made an inroad into the closely-watched 1,000 stg resistance but the run-up proved shortlived . 
traders complained of continued poor manufacturer interest to help boost activity . 
&quot; The strange thing about it is that the industry are remarkably quiet and they seem to be reasonably well covered , or they &apos;re running everything on a low stock basis because they &apos;ve been out of the market for a month , &quot; a trader said .
