several people were injured in violence involving supporters of Indonesia &apos;s ruling Golkar party during election campaigning in the capital Jakarta on Thursday , witnesses said . 
it was the latest in a series of minor clashes which have hit campaigning for the May 29 general elections . 
witnesses said Golkar supporters passing a construction site in a southern suburb of the capital demanded the workers there join them in shouting political slogans . 
the workers refused and heavy stone-throwing erupted from both sides . 
several people sustained head wounds , but the fighting died down before squads of armed troops and anti-riot police reached the scene , the witnesses said . 
the windshields of more than 20 cars were damaged and stones littered the main thoroughfare adjoining the construction site . 
witnesses said none of those injured appeared to be badly hurt although several were led away bleeding . 
police at the site refused to comment and there was no official word on the incident . 
earlier , police said there were sporadic clashes on Wednesday as supporters of the minority United Development Party ( PPP ) campaigned in Central Java province and Jakarta . 
the reports of violence hit financial markets in the city , which were already nervous because of the spreading effects of steep falls in Thailand &apos;s currency and stock market . 
the rupiah closed in Jakarta at the day &apos;s low of 2,442.00 / 43.00 against the dollar from a 2433.50 open while the local stock market index ended down 1.98 percent at 656.99 points . 
the biggest clash on Wednesday came during campaigning by the Moslem-oriented PPP near Temanggung , 400 km ( 250 miles ) southeast of Jakarta in Central Java . 
police and army sources in Temanggung and surrounding towns said thousands of PPP supporters turned violent in the province , which has seen repeated trouble in the past few weeks . 
&quot; It &apos;s quiet again today , but yesterday they attacked this police station and caused serious damage , &quot; a policeman at Kedu precinct , who did not give his name , told Reuters by telephone . 
&quot; There were no arrests and no serious injuries , &quot; he added . 
another 75 seats in the house are allotted to the military , which does not vote . 
the Jakarta Post newspaper reported on Thursday that PPP supporters attacked government offices , shops , churches , other buildings and cars while burning Golkar flags during a 10 km ( six mile ) march near Temanggung involving 6,000 people . 
the newspaper said participants wore white , the traditional colour of mourning or protest , instead of the PPP &apos;s usual green , because of unfair treatment by authorities and the beating of their supporters by security forces . 
in Jakarta a police station in Ciracas in the east of the capital was slightly damaged on Wednesday when a crowd of PPP supporters attacked it . 
the official Antara news agency quoted Jakarta police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Edi Aritonang as saying the incident occured after a campaigner was detained for extorting money in a nearby market . 
two policemen were slightly injured in the incident and three people were detained . 
residents said there were also clashes between PPP supporters and youths living in a military housing complex in south Jakarta who supported Golkar . 
Golkar , in power for the last 30 years under President Suharto , is seeking to push its share of the vote to more than 70 percent from the 68 percent it won at the last polls in 1992 .
