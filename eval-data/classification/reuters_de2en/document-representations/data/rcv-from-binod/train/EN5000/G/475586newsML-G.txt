Pro-British Loyalists tried to blow up a Belfast office of the IRA &apos;s political wing , Sinn Fein on Sunday , in an apparent breach of their 1994 ceasefire . 
the British Broadcasting Corporation quoted Loyalist sources as saying the attempt was a &quot; measured &quot; response to attacks by their Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) foes , who seek to end British rule . 
a complete breakdown of the Loyalists &apos; 1994 ceasefire would return Northern Ireland to the tit-for-tat violence which reigned until both Loyalists and the IRA called a halt to their wars to pursue an Anglo-Irish peace initiative . 
security forces said they made safe the 40 kg ( 88-lb ) bomb , which was driven to the New Lodge offices of Sinn Fein in a hijacked taxi on the day that Irish republicans commemorate the 1916 Dublin rising against British rule . 
Britain &apos;s Northern Ireland Secretary , Sir Patrick Mayhew , condemned Loyalists for the attack but made no comment about whether it would affect the participation of their political spokesmen at Belfast peace talks which resume on June 3 . 
two small political groups allied to Loyalist guerrilla organisations have claimed seats at the Belfast negotiations . 
Sinn Fein is excluded because of the IRA &apos;s ending of its own 17-month truce in February 1996 . 
Mayhew said in a statement that the New Lodge attack together with the IRA shooting of a policeman and an attempted IRA bomb attack against British troops at the weekend were the work of groups with no commitment to democracy . 
&quot; The message is that the organisations concerned still rely upon death and destruction to secure what they want in this democracy , &quot; he said . 
the weekend violence underscored the tension in Northern Ireland on the eve of a Belfast parade by Protestants which signals the start of the annual &quot; marching season , &quot; which is seen by minority Catholics as a show of Protestant domination . 
loyalists have been blamed for several previous attacks but their umbrella group , the Combined Loyalist Military Command , has not issued a statement saying the truce is officially over . 
weekend violence highlighted what Royal Ulster Constabulary police chief Ronnie Flanagan called a very dangerous situation in Northern Ireland since the end of the IRA truce . 
Gerry Adams , the Sinn Fein President , told a Belfast rally that a British general election on May 1 offered the Northern Ireland electorate &quot; a new opportunity to reconstruct the peace process . 
he was apparently reacting to a weekend statement by Mo Mowlam , spokeswoman for Northern Ireland of the opposition Labour party , which seems set to topple Prime Minister John Major &apos;s Conservative government in the election . 
Mowlam said that if the IRA ended its war against British rule immediately , it could claim a seat at the Belfast talks when they resume on June 3 . 
she said the months of April and May could be used to verify that a new IRA ceasefire was genuine , but Adams gave no hint that such a move was imminent and made no allusion to media speculation about a possible pre-election IRA ceasefire . 
Sinn Fein &apos;s ideological foes , Protestant Unionist parties which want the province to stay British , say they will walk out of the Belfast talks if Sinn Fein enters because they do not believe the IRA will declare a complete end to guerrilla war . 
Sinn Fein is contesting several seats in the poll to underline its support , estimated at around 15 per cent of the electorate . 
Party policy is not to take up seats it wins in the London parliament because it would entail allegiance to Britain .
