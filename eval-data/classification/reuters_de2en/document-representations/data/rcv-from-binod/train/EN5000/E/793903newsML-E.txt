a $ 16-billion international loan package for Thailand won a sombre reception from analysts on Tuesday who view it as only the start of a long and painful rehabilitation . 
Thailand would go through at least two years of tough economic and financial restructuring after it obtained the loans sponsored by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , analysts said . 
the IMF announced on Monday it would contribute $ 4 billion to the package designed to help Thailand recover from its severe financial crunch . 
Japan agreed to provide another $ 4 billion with the remainder coming from other governments and multilateral agencies . 
&quot; We still don &apos;t know the details of the IMF package and there &apos;s going to be a lot more to it than has been announced ... they ( IMF ) welcomed the measures taken by Thailand and look forward to developing them into a multiyear adjustment program , &quot; said Graham Catterwell , managing director of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell ( Thailand ) . 
Catterwell said he expected Thailand to hold more talks with the IMF on details of the rescue package . 
&quot; There &apos;s a lot more being quietly hammered out behind the scenes in terms of the overall package and that won &apos;t be a done deal until it &apos;s signed , sealed and delivered , &quot; he said . 
Neil Saker , head of regional economic research at Socgen-Crosby Securities PTE Ltd , said loans from the IMF package would likely be made available over the next few years . 
some of them would be made through currency swap accounts to which Thailand would not have immediate access , he added . 
Saker said despite the international bailout , he expected the Thai economy to slip almost into a recession . 
he said the Thai gross domestic product ( GDP ) would expand by between zero and one percent this year and about two percent in 1998 , its slowest in more than three decades . 
Chira Hongladarom , an academic and former university lecturer , said rich and poor Thais would feel economic pain through a sharply higher cost of living brought by the austere IMF programme . 
&quot; The recovery will be a long process as we are stuck deep in our mistakes , &quot; he said . 
&quot; This is a major turning point for Thailand . 
hopefully , it will evolve into a better time ahead . 
Saker of Socgen-Crosby said Thailand erred in devaluing its baht in early July as it aggravated a crisis of confidence already faced by its battered financial sector . 
he said the devaluation would trigger a spate of corporate bankruptcies in the next one to two years . 
&quot; corporates have been badly damaged by the baht devaluation which I think was a mistake , &quot; Saker said . 
&quot; It made corporate balance sheets look very bad . 
the Bank of Thailand last week temporarily closed down more than half of the country &apos;s 91 finance companies , many of which were saddled with mounting non-performing loans extended to a collapsed property sector . 
Thai Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya said on Tuesday that $ 73 billion of Thailand &apos;s $ 89 billion foreign debt had been tapped by its private sector . 
more than 40 percent of private foreign debt was short-term of up to one-year maturity . 
Thai corporate borrowers faced a higher debt financing burden due to the baht &apos;s 20 percent depreciation since early July . 
Saker estimated that Thailand &apos;s foreign reserves , depleted in the aftermath of its costly defence of the baht in May , now stood at about $ 15 billion and they should fall to about $ 10 billion by end-September . 
he said the IMF rescue package should raise the Thai reserves to only about $ 16 billion this year , far below its $ 39.9-billion peak last October .
