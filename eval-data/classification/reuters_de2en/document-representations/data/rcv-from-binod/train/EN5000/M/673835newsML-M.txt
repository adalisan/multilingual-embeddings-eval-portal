European oil swaps slipped on Thursday as the southwards draw of late Wednesday &apos;s screen crude brought much of the complex lower this morning . 
only Brent CFDs managed to resist the slip lower as a plateful of wet deals thinned out supply helping to offset the bearish undertone . 
gasoline was only slightly weaker . 
Brent CFDs were steady to very marginally firmer with June 23-27 heard traded at -31 cents against August from -32 cents yesterday while June 30-July 4 was pegged at -32.50 from -33 / 34 cents . 
July 7-11 was put broadly steady at -32 cents while July 14-18 was pegged at -30 cents . 
gas oil crack spreads were weaker and 4Q97 slipped to $ 4.45 from $ 4.55 with 1Q98 at $ 4.55 from $ 4.58 although nothing was heard traded in the morning . 
heavy fuel tracked down about $ 1 or so with July pegged about $ 81.75 with August at $ 82.50 and September in contango by $ 1 or so . 
physical barges were also weaker from Wednesday with levels talked around $ 82-84 fob Ara . 
low sulphur swaps were also lower by up to $ 2 with July assessed around $ 90 with August in contango by $ 1 a tonne . 
Naphtha swaps slipped to $ 174.50 / 175.00 with a $ 1 contango seen into August and a further 50 cents contango into September . 
dealers said swaps were off in part because July prompt wet barrels were seen to have become overcooked in recent days and a readjustment was required . 
gasoline was narrowly lower with July pegged around $ 181.50 , about 50 cents off and August down about 25 cents at $ 181.75 , September remained backwardated by $ 1 or so . 
dealers said gasoline lost ground yesterday after heavy NYMEX falls and was now trying to consolidate .
