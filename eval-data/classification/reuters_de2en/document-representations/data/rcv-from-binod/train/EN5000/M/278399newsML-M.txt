the Dow industrials rose 23.83 points to 6,546.68 , leaving the index of 30 blue-chip stocks just shy of its record of 6,547.79 set on Nov . 25 . 
it was the seventh straight rise for the world &apos;s most widely watched stock index . 
&quot; Maybe it &apos;s the Christmas spirit carrying over , &quot; said Michael Metz , chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer and Co . &quot; It &apos;s the usual amount of random noise in the last few sessions of the year . 
the biggest investors are already done &quot; for 1996 , he said . 
at the New York Stock Exchange Thursday , winners beat losers , 1,576 to 831 , on volume of 253.4 million shares , the lightest full session this year .

&quot; I don &apos;t think we &apos;ll get much action for the rest of the year with the holidays this week and next week . 
Brokerages and investment houses are minimally staffed , &quot; said Ed Nicoski , a Piper Jaffray technical analyst . 
in currency markets , the yen took a beating after stock prices tumbled again in Tokyo on worries the government &apos;s new budget , calling for a tax increase , would hurt the fledgling economic recovery . 
Tokyo &apos;s Nikkei average of 225 leading shares plunged more than 700 points during the session before rebounding to close down 257.83 points at 19,291.58 . 
&quot; The dollar &apos;s rise against the yen came on the back of the drop in the Nikkei , &quot; said Paul Park , vice president and dollar-yen trader at Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank . 
&quot; The knee-jerk reaction has just been to buy dollars against yen . 
it &apos;s the easiest money out there right now and I think it will continue to attract investors , &quot; he said .

the dollar stood at 114.95 yen late in New York trading , up from 114.47 late on Tuesday .
