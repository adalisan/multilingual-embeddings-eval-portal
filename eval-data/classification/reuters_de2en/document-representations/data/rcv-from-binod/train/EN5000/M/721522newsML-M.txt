U.S. debt futures sustained their mid-morning recovery and closed higher as pullbacks in the afternoon were quickly met with buyers , traders and floor analysts said . 
&quot; In the absence of selling , this market goes up , &quot; one T-bond futures floor analyst said . 
&quot; In that sense , this market is becoming a lot like stocks . 
&quot; There is no reason to fade this market , but when it does dipped lower the bid comes in right away , &quot; one analyst said . 
September T-bonds rose to 114-15 / 32 , near resistance at 114-16 / 32 or key support of 6.50 percent in the long bond . 
the contract came on the cusp of that significant technical level due to a heavy curve flattening trade and steady dealer buying . 
talk of a reduction in U.S. Treasury auctions continued to circulate in the markets . 
there are ideas the Treasury may scale back auctions due to projections for a decline in the U.S. budget deficit for fiscal year 1997 . 
democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said the Congressional Budget Office has slashed its estimate of the federal budget deficit for the year ending September 30 to below $ 50 billion . 
the CBO was looking for a deficit of $ 67 billion two months ago and a deficit of $ 124 billion earlier this year , Moynihan noted . 
one major U.S. dealer bought roughly 4,000 September T-bonds , and was rumored to be a heavy seller of the September two-year T-notes , traders said . 
&quot; The market backed off resistance , but people are tentative to sell on weakness , &quot; one bond futures trader said . 
September T-bonds sustained its recovery off the daily low of 113-23 / 32 which it established after favorable U.S. producer price data for June . 
the June producer price index fell 0.1 percent , versus average trade estimates for unchanged , and the core rate rose 0.1 percent , as expected . 
expectations began to grow that September could fall to Thursday &apos;s low of 113-16 / 32 and stage a reversal . 
however , the lack of selling pressure forced the market higher and drew about five banks to buy between 1,000 and 2,000 September T-bonds through the 114-06 / 32 area . 
meanwhile , December Eurodollars , taking a cue from T-bonds , rose near the daily high of 94.09 . 
&quot; The market is still bulled up and we aren &apos;t going to see any aggressive selling , so as a result any dips will be bought , &quot; one Eurodollar futures trader said , adding that buying was moderate . 
he said a stronger than expected rise in U.S. June retail sales , which will be released on Tuesday , could knock the market lower . 
at the end of pit trade , September T-bonds were up 08 / 32 at 114-04 / 32 , 10-year notes were up 03 / 32 at 109-18 / 32 , December Eurodollars were steady at 94.07 , muni bonds were up 05 / 32 at 119-16 / 32 and five-year notes were up 02 / 32 at 107-02 / 32 .
