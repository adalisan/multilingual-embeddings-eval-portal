the following is the daily forecast for spreads in the Portuguese bond market based on a poll of three banks and one brokerage . 
poll covers spreads between the February 2007 Portuguese cash bond ( ot ) and the German and Spanish equivalents , together with the spreads between the Portuguese 10 and two-year bonds . 
Min spread Avge Max vs previous close 
Feb 07 vs Bund July 07 65 bps 67.75 70 70 
Feb 07 vs Bono March 07 4 4.5 5 6 
Min Avge Max 
Feb 07 vs March 99 106 108.25 110 vs 108 
key factors likely to affect market : 
-the 10 year bonds are likely to follow the weaker tone of the Spanish Bonos after the Bank of Spain left the repo unchanged . 
but the strength of the dollar will act as a brake to losses and probably help narrow spread with Bunds . 
the curve unlikely to steepen as local money rates showing little change , traders said .
