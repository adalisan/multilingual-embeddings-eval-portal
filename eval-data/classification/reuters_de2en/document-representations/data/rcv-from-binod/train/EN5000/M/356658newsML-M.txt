U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs has &quot; cautiously &quot; recommended buying the South African rand , according to the Financial Times of London . 
the bank gave five reasons for its faith in the rand , the paper said . 
it calculates that the currency &apos;s real value is about 4.18 to the dollar ; it forecasts that high interest rates will remain in place until the middle of the year ; it expects the fiscal deficit to fall for 1997 / 98 ; it tips external trade to improve in coming months , partly thanks to last year &apos;s deprecriation ; and it said short-term capital inflows should boost foreign exhange reserves . 
Goldman Sachs officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the newspaper report .
