satellite broadcaster BSkyB said on Monday it planned to offer a pay-per-view boxing special next month featuring Britain &apos;s Prince Naseem Hamed . 
WBO world featherweight champion Hamed will top the bill with his unification fight against IBF champion Tom Johnson of the United States at London &apos;s Docklands Arena on February 8 . 
the fight will be one of four world title bouts from the same bill available to Sky subscribers for 9.95 stg , or 14.95 if they book after midnight on February 7 . 
subscribers taking up the offer will also get to see the WBC heavyweight title bout between Briton Lennox Lewis and American Oliver McCall from Las Vegas the previous night . 
coverage of that fight will begin at midnight on February 7 . 
BSkyB experimented successfully with pay-per-view boxing twice last year and is expected eventually to introduce the payment method for big soccer matches .
