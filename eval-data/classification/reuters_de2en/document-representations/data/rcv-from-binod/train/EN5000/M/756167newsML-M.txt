precious metal prices were little changed on Friday afternoon , having weathered turbulence overnight and consolidated in earlier trade , dealers said . 
platinum held firm on continuing tight physical supply . 
gold was fixed at $ 324.10 per ounce , down just 40 cents from the morning and up from $ 321.95 on Thursday afternoon . 
the August contract on New York &apos;s COMEX futures market was a dollar ahead at $ 324.80 . 
dealers saw gold being confined to a $ 321.00- $ 328.00 range after break-out attempts had failed on the upside and retracement support had been established at $ 318- $ 320 . 
&quot; It is still a sell-the-rally market , &quot; one dealer said , adding that although gold might have some upside potential , &quot; I advise the clients not to forget to sell . 
the tight platinum market was firm , although it fixed a dollar easier from the morning at $ 421.00 . 
&quot; As long as the lease rates remain high and the market is tight , prices will go higher , &quot; a platinum metals dealer said . 
Russia delivered its first platinum shipment of 1997 to Tokyo late on Thursday , but that had done nothing to lift the squeeze on nearby supplies , he said . 
a one-month lease rate of around 35 percent for platinum and 80 percent for palladium showed the scarcity of nearby metal . 
platinum &apos;s premium over gold stretch to over $ 100 during Friday afternoon business , having hovered at around $ 90 during most of the month . 
Russia , which is the largest palladium exporter and the world &apos;s second largest export of platinum after South Africa , had failed to export either metal until earlier this month due to administrative problems . 
&quot; Undoubtedly they have the material , but they are not selling as much this year as last , &quot; one dealer said . 
he added that Russia had an export window of only about four months before 1998 contract talks would begin . 
the tightness and high borrowing rates were encouraging industrial users of the metals to buy rather than lease metal to use as process catalysts . 
&quot; usually these people would lease and return metal for re-refining when it was spent . 
but at 80 percent for a month , they would prefer to borrow the money , buy the metal and accept the price risk , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; The market reacted far too quickly when the first deliveries arrived in Tokyo . 
there is still some way to go before this is sorted out , &quot; another dealer said .
