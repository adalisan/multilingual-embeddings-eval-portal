German industrial giant Daimler-Benz AG , whose reorganisation plans have sparked an internal power struggle , on Tuesday said it would put off a decision about a corporate overhaul until early 1997 . 
&quot; The board wants to consider the management structure more intensively over the next few weeks , &quot; it said in a statement after a meeting of the executive committee of its supervisory board . 
Germany &apos;s largest industrial group has been considering a reorganisation for some months , as part of efforts to make individual operating units more profitable , and closer integration of its main car and truck making operation , Mercedes-Benz . 
what would become of Mercedes and its chairman , Helmut Werner , has become the object of intense internal political manoeuvring . 
the reorganisation has led to bad blood within the Daimler group , where speculation of a turf war between Mercedes-Benz chairman Werner and Daimler group chairman Juergen Schrempp has grown almost by the day . 
according to local media , Werner has threatened to resign if his operation were integrated more closely . 
industry sources on Monday said Schrempp , desperate to prevent the loss of the highly-regarded Werner , has gone as far as to offer the Mercedes boss a top job in the restructured Daimler in order to keep him on board . 
Werner &apos;s contract as management board member of Daimler , which expires at the end of 1997 , is up for renewal at a supervisory board meeting on November 6 . 
his contract at Mercedes runs until 1999 . 
but Daimler said on Tuesday that it would not decide any personnel moves at the November meeting . 
Mercedes officials , who oversee the bulk of Daimler &apos;s profit and revenues , have reportedly baulked at closer integration and are resentful that their operation must help underwrite loss-making units such as Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG . 
Mercedes , which now makes up around three-quarters of Daimler &apos;s group revenues , has predicted its 1996 profits will be clearly higher than last year &apos;s 2.275 billion marks ( $ 1.49 billion ) . 
according to company sources , six of seven board members at Daimler favour plans to integrate Mercedes into the parent with only Werner opposed to the move . 
despite the support of board members , analysts said Schrempp was in no position to force his wishes through . 
Daimler has already suffered a series of public relations fiascos recently , including a record 5.3 billion mark loss last year .
