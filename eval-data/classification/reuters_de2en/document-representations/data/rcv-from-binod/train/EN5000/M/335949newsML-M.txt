the escudo was strengthening against the mark on Monday , breaking back below 100 to the German currency on Monday . 
the Portuguese unit , which slipped against the mark last week as the peseta lost ground , was trading at 99.85 / 90 to the mark at 1205 GMT . 
the currency opened at 100.01 / 06 after closing on Friday at 100.12 / 17 . 
dealers said that the currency could hold below the psychological barrier of 100 after the Bank of Portugal showed last week that it was determined to protect the currency . 
the slight weakness of the escudo was one reason , dealers say , why the Bank did not cut key interest rates as expected last Friday .
