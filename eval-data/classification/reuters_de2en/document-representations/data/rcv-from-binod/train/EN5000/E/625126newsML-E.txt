Deputy finance minister Chaturon Chaisaeng said on Thursday that Thai government revenue for fiscal 1996 / 97 ( October-September ) is expected to be 880 billion baht ( $ 33.8 billion ) against an earlier projected 925 billion . 
&quot; The finance ministry has revised down government revenue for this fiscal year . 
the revenue is expected to be at 880 billion baht compared with a previous forecast of 925 billion baht , &quot; Chaturon told reporters . 
the finance ministry &apos;s permanent secretary Chatumongkol Sonakul said the government would not cut its spending further as a result of the lower-than-expected revenue . 
&quot; Any additional reduction in government spending might further hurt the economy , &quot; he said . 
the government early this year cut its projection of expected revenue to about 925 billion baht from a previous projection of 984 billion baht . 
a slowdown in the Thai economy , which has been plagued by troubles in the financial and property sectors , sluggish exports , a plunging stock market and a weak currency , is seen by analysts as the reason for the low tax and revenue collection . 
&quot; However , the government &apos;s spending and revenue is expected to remained balanced this year , &quot; Chatumongkol said , indicating that there would be no deficit budget .
