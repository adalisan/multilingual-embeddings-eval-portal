CME lumber futures recovered late as commercial support prompted by firmer cash markets offset early pressure from weather concerns , traders said . 
poor weather could cut home building and demand for wood but selling interest in futures lacked followthrough after tumbling early . 
renewed demand prompted by reports of firmer cash markets also lent support after the recent technical correction , traders said . 
although mills were returing from holiday closures , both dealers and wholesalers remained short of product and this kept lumber prices firm , cash sources said . 
expectations continued of higher cash prices going into the spring home building season . 
problems with shipping wood due to floods and heavy snows prompted concern over deliveries , traders added . 
the Commerce Department reported November new housing completions up 2.1 percent to 1.391 million units . 
they said the November increase was the largest since May . 
lumber closed mostly $ 0.80 per tbf higher to $ 4.00 lower with January up $ 0.60 at $ 433.70 and March up most at $ 429.70 per tbf .
