the coach of Albania &apos;s under-21 soccer squad said on Thursday at least two players had abandoned the team in Spain and were heading for Germany with hopes of playing in Frankfurt . 
other team members said they might leave the squad as well and seek asylum outside their country . 
the team had to play two matches in southern Spain after political unrest in Albania forced the games to be moved from home venues . 
coach Suleiman Mema told Reuters that team members were deserting because &quot; under the circumstances , they know they can &apos;t play football right now in Albania &quot; . 
two players planned to try to play for a Frankfurt team , he said . 
the under-21 squad , which was in Granada together with Albania &apos;s national team , was scheduled to fly home to Tirana sometime on Thursday . 
one player , Zeka Kresnic , said he and many of his teammates might decide not to go home and instead try to sign with soccer clubs in Spain or other European countries . 
&quot; We still don &apos;t know what we will do , &quot; he said . 
media reports said some of the players had contacted Spanish human rights groups . 
a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the government had not received any asylum requests from the Albanians . 
Albanian soccer officials decided late last month to move two of the national team &apos;s home matches and two of the under-21 squad &apos;s games to Spain to protect players and fans from the anarchy sweeping the Balkan state . 
the national team , which had World Cup European group qualifier matches in Granada against Ukraine and Germany , was drawn from Albanians playing for clubs outside their own country , mostly in Greece , Germany , Slovenia , Croatia , Romania and Malta . 
the under-21 squad was assembled from teams in the Albanian soccer league . 
Eduard Dervishi , general secretary of the Albanian soccer Federation , said he knew nothing about the players &apos; plans but noted that &quot; because there is no football being played in Albania it is probable they will want to play elsewhere &quot; . 
asked about Kresnic &apos;s comments , national team coach Haafizi Astrit said : &quot; It &apos;s none of my business . 
Albania &apos;s under-21 team fared poorly in its Spanish matches , losing 0-4 to Germany on Tuesday and 0-3 against Ukraine last Saturday . 
Albania &apos;s national team also suffered two defeats . 
it was beaten 2-3 by Germany on Wednesday and 0-1 by Ukraine last Saturday .
