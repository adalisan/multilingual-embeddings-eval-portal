Britain &apos;s economy is strengthening in line with forecasts but there are no signs of overheating and inflationary pressure remains subdued , Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said on Saturday . 
&quot; Retail sales actually fell off slightly in December compared with November , maunfacturing remains very flat and the data since ( December ) have shown a strong , healthy recovery but not one that is showing any signs of overheating , &quot; Clarke told Reuters Financial Television in an interview in Davos . 
it is strengthening in line with the forecasts . 
inflationary pressure seems subdued . 
there are one or two things we are going to have to have a look at , &quot; he said at the World Economic Forum . 
Clarke said he would take a broad view of data to determine the appropriate level for interest rates , but reiterated he felt justified in not having raised rates in December despite the Bank of England &apos;s recommendation he do so by 1 / 4 point . 
&quot; You just need to take a pace back and have a look at all the data . 
it is a little unbalanced , a little asymmetrical in different parts of the economy . 
the recovery is very strong , a bit patchy . 
inflationary pressure is subdued , &quot; he said . 
he said it was now clear that some analysts &apos; forecasts at the end of last year that British interest rates would have to rise quickly in 1997 were incorrect . 
&quot; I think one thing the markets have now adjusted to is that all the clear expectations too many people had before Christmas are wrong , &quot; he said . 
Clarke insisted political considerations were playing no role in his deliberations on interest rates in the run-up to British elections that must be held by late May . 
&quot; Political concerns really are not playing any part in this . 
politically it is perfectly possible for me to explain to the public the fact that interest rates ( are ) up , down or keep them where they are , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The public wish to be reassured that we are going to keep the United Kingdom a low-inflation economy . 
that is the way to make sure growth is sustainable , &quot; he added . 
Clarke said he was watching sterling &apos;s exchange rate , which he noted had strengthened by 20 percent against the mark in the year to January , but he added it was not &quot; the be-all and end-all of monetary policy &quot; . 
&quot; I don &apos;t regard the exchange rate as the best method of controlling inflation . 
it &apos;s not , but it does have a deflationary effect when you have such a strengthening of your currency , &quot; he said .
