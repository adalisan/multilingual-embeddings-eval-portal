near-term prospects for Mexican shares to extend last week &apos;s record-breaking rally are not a certainty , although market players are cautiously optimistic for continued gains , equity analysts said . 
Mexico &apos;s blue chip IPC index notched up three record closes in a row to end at 3,999.52 points on Thursday , March 22 , before taking what analysts said was a breather on Friday before volume thinned Monday due to the U.S. Memorial Day holiday . 
analysts agreed the recent rally was uneven and lacked brisk volume , but differed in their interpretation of how upcoming mid-term elections would impact the Mexican bourse . 
Felix boni , research head at ING-Barings said another rally could come ahead of the July 6 elections if the markets overcame concerns that the Mexico City mayor race would be won by the centre-left Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) . 
&quot; There is too much concern over the markets over the possibility of a PRD victory in Mexico City , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There could be a rally based on the realization the elections for Mexico City are less important than those in Congress . 
boni said the timing of a future rally would depend on whether this realization came ahead of the elections . 
Mexico will vote on July 6 to replace the entire lower house of Congress and one quarter of the Senate . 
Mexico City residents will also elect their mayor for the first time . 
other governorship races also take place . 
for Lars Shonander , research head at Santander Investment , stocks still had several other short-term hurdles , in addition to local mid-term elections , to clear before sustainable gains were possible . 
Shonander said second quarter company earnings loomed large on the equity front and the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting in July would also have an impact . 
&quot; There is no fundamental upside in the short run ... and not enough momentum to sustain any further gains , &quot; Schonander said . 
&quot; It was an odd , uneven rally ( last week ) . 
volume was not particularly strong . 
David Chon of Bears Stearns said short-term gains were possible as Mexican stocks were &quot; conservatively priced , &quot; although he cautioned investors to be selective . 
&quot; It is surely a stock-pickers &apos; environment . 
even within sectors , there is a wide range between winners and losers , &quot; he said . 
Mexican bourse had become &quot; more mature &quot; over the past year , Chon said , with investors looking more at company fundamentals than market sentiment . 
Chon said the recent &quot; rise &quot; in share prices was led by blue chips , which was a &quot; good sign . 
regarding the mid-term elections , Chon predicted the market would act ahead of time . 
&quot; The market will take a bet on the elections , it will not wait for the elections , &quot; he said . 
boni agreed stock buyers needed to be selective . 
&quot; selectivity is the word , &quot; he said , adding that macroeconomic figures suggested the momentum for economic growth was weaker than GDP growth data might indicate , and GDP growth alone did not drive company profits . 
according to the finance ministry , Mexico &apos;s GDP grew 5.1 percent in the first quarter compared to the previous year . 
&quot; The question is how long this weak recovery can last , &quot; boni said , noting that retail sales and unemployment data had been disappointing . 
Mexico &apos;s National Association of self-service and Department Stores said on Monday that supermarket sales in April fell 4.0 percent in year-on-year terms . 
the National Statistics Institute ( INEGI ) announced last week that open unemployment in April gained to 4.3 percent in April , from 4.2 percent in March . 
despite their short-term discrepancies , both ING-Barings and Santander predicted the IPC would close 1997 at 4,600 points , according to a Reuters survey .
