the World Bank is planning to lend $ 2.0 to $ 3.0 billion annually to Russia , Caio Koch-Weser , managing director of operations at the World Bank , said on Thursday . 
&quot; We are quite bullish on Russia . 
we are planning to provide $ 2.0 to $ 3.0 billion a year to Russia , &quot; Koch-Weser told a news conference at the second Central and Eastern European Economic Summit . 
Koch-Weser said Central and Eastern Europe is an &quot; area of growth &quot; for the World Bank and it lends roughly $ 5.0 a year for 65 operations . 
the World Bank official said those operations included funding for both reform supporting adjustment programmes and investment lending . 
separately , the World Bank director said pension reform and social security reform was a central issue currently facing emerging economies . 
&quot; We believe this is one of the central issues right now . 
they have a rapidly ageing and large share of old population and they cannot afford the current systems , &quot; Koch-Weser said .
