the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday that Hungary &apos;s low economic growth rate may pick up over the next few years and catch up with the growth rates in Poland or the Czech Republic . 
&quot; I expect gradually increasing growth rate , &quot; said Willy Kiekens , a member of the IMF &apos;s board of directors , told a news conference . 
&quot; I think it could catch up with the Polish or the Czech level in the next few years . 
the rate of GDP growth dropped to 1.5 percent last year , according to preliminary figures , from 2.9 percent in 1994 after Hungary introduced an economic austerity programme last March to rein in its soaring budget and current account deficits . 
economic growth was quicker in both the Czech Republic and Poland , countries which , similarly to Hungary , are in transition to a market economy and hope to join the European Union . 
the Czech GDP increased by some five percent last year , and almost seven percent in Poland . 
Hungary expects a growth rate below one percent for this year and some two to three percent in 1997 . 
Members of the IMF &apos;s board of directors visiting Hungary told reporters the austerity programme may have slowed GDP growth , but the measures were necessary to stabilise the economy and create the conditions of sustainable growth . 
&quot; In the second half of 1994 and in the first half of 1995 , the economy was in a very fragile situation , &quot; Kiekens said . 
&quot; In mid-term , there is a positive correlation between economic adjustment and growth , &quot; said Bernd Esdar , member the IMF &apos;s board of directors . 
Esdar added that &quot; Hungary achieved tremendous progress &quot; and as a result of the economic programme the country has been able to significantly reduce its budget and current account deficits and inflation , while real wages have slumped , however . 
Kiekens told Reuters that Hungary &apos;s economic growth is likely to pick up if the country continues to reduce inflation and provided its fiscal deficit , not including debt service on loans to be taken over from the central bank , drops in 1997 to three percent of GDP from this year &apos;s four percent target . 
he said Hungary should not soften its economic programme in 1997 as it approaches elections and should continue deep economic reforms . 
these should include the passing in March 1997 at the latest of a planned law to reform the pension system and further streamlining of the healthcare system . 
he added the economic austerity programme appears to have restored Hungary &apos;s international competitiveness and the government &apos;s plans to maintain the real value of wages in 1997 were likely to be justified . 
but IMF will form its final view on this question in December , when it will send a delegation to Hungary to survey for example budget , exports and current account figures as part of a review of a stand-by loan which the IMF granted to Hungary in March , Kiekens said .
