--------------------- ( July 28 ) ------------------------------ 
* Australian bonds barely moved in early trading , finding few fresh incentives in front of next week &apos;s RBA board meeting . 
* Thursday &apos;s retail trade seen as only key local event . 
* U.S. releases several major indicators this week . 
Australian bonds got off to a slow start to the week , barely moving from Friday &apos;s closing levels in the absence of few fresh incentives in front of next week &apos;s Reserve Bank board meeting . 
a 50 basis point easing in monetary policy is largely factored in , as it has been more or less for over a month , and until such a move is endorsed by the RBA the market will find it difficult to progress last week &apos;s rally further . 
the 10-year bond futures contract struck an all-time high of 93.640 last week , which took the cash yield below 6.40 percent , its lowest level since the early 1980s . 
Thursday &apos;s retail trade data is seen as the only local indicator of importance this week , although it is unlikely to change the market &apos;s view that an interest rate cut is on the agenda , traders said . 
the June balance of goods and services and building approvals are also due on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively . 
the driving force for the market is otherwise likely to come from U.S. , where a steady flow of data includes the second quarter employment cost index on Tuesday , the advanced GDP reading for the same quarter on Thursday and the all important July non-farm payrolls on Friday . 
yield spreads to the U.S. were little changed , while they tightened to the Canadian short end where the Canadian currency came under pressure . 
U.S. yields crept higher on Friday during a tightly traded session . 
new Zealand debt also remained hostage to the plight of the N.Z. 
dollar .
