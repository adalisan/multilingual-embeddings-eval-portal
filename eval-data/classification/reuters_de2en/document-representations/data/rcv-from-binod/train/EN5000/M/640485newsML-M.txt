Greek bonds were licking their wounds in late trade , spooked by a pickup in interbank rates following the announcement of an FRN auction at the end of June by the deputy Finance Minister Nikos Christodoulakis , dealers said . 
the drachma regained some ground it had lost against the ecu in early dealings trading marginally below 310 , traders said . 
&quot; Depos and implied drachma rates from forex forwards have risen another fourth of a point on what seems to be a liquidity squeeze as players sought funding for FRNs after the announcement , &quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank . 
Deputy Finance Minister Nikos Christodoulakis told reporters Greece will auction seven-year FRNs at the end of June . 
bonds were under selling pressure again , shedding another 80 basis points in terms of price and traders said the higher cost of carry and the state &apos;s borrowing schedule for the rest of 1997 accounted for the drop . 
Christodoulakis unveiled the state &apos;s domestic borrowing schedule for the rest of 1997 . 
it is the first time ever that Greece made public its domestic borrowing programme . 
&quot; The borrowing schedule showed that there would be more auctions of FRNs in the rest of 1997 and a bigger debt paper supply is not what the market wanted to hear at this point , &quot; said a bond trader . 
FRNs came also under selling pressure but suffered smaller losses of 25 to 50 basis points , traders said . 
Greece will reopen bids for three- , five- and seven-year coupon bonds on June 17 and auction its first-ever 10-year fixed coupon bonds . 
the amount is 50 billion drachmas for each maturity . 
the treasury auctioned three-year , 9.80 percent bonds , five-year , 9.20 percent and seven-year , 8.9 percent paper on June 19 . 
it will also auction 100 billion drachmas of 10-year fixed coupon bonds on June 19 . 
the coupon has not been set yet . 
the mark was quoted at 158.90 / 00 from Friday &apos;s 159.170 fix , the dollar at 274.60 / 70 drachmas from 275.000 and the ecu at 309.96 / 06 from 310.220 drachmas . 
&quot; The drachma has posted some gains against the ecu hovering slightly below 310 in late dealings , &quot; a forex dealer at a foreign bank said .
