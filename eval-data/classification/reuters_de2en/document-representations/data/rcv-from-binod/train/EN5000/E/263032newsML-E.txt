German money supply growth may exceed the Bundesbank &apos;s target growth rate of four to seven percent at the end of this year , the German central bank said in its December report , released on Tuesday . 
October data showed M3 expansion of 8.4 percent from the fourth quarter of 1995 , still well outside the range , and the Bundesbank said the pace of monetary expansion had accelerated somewhat in recent months . 
&quot; It is possible that the money supply goal will also be exceeded at the end of the year , &quot; the Bundesbank said . 
the central bank attributed the M3 acceleration to a renewed weakness of monetary capital formation , which it suggested may be connected with liquidity needs related to the issue of Deutsche Telekom shares in November . 
&quot; In addition , bank lending to the public sector strengthened considerably in October , &quot; the report said , noting an 11.5 percent rise in public sector lending from August to October , compared with a one percent rise the previous quarter . 
&quot; As these influences recede , money supply growth should weaken again , &quot; it added . 
the central bank said that although money supply has not slowed as much as desired , M3 does not represent an inflationary danger . 
sales of money market funds to domestic non-banks had not had a noticeable effect on money supply in 1996 , unlike the previous year , the Bundesbank noted . 
sight deposits showed the fastest expansion in the August to October period and the Bundesbank commented that high liquidity was not unusual at a time of low interest rates and favourable inflation .
