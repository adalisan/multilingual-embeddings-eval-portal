former Irish international Willie Anderson on Tuesday ruled himself out of the running for the Ireland coaching job should New Zealander Murray Kidd be sacked from the position at Tuesday &apos;s meeting Irish Rugby Football Union ( IRFU ) officials . 
Anderson signed a one-year contract as coach to the London Irish team which competes in division one of the English league in the autumn of 1996 . 
&quot; I came over to London Irish to help them stay up in Division One . 
that is my job at this moment in time , &quot; Anderson said . 
&quot; There might be an opportunity at the end of the season for me to do that ( take over as Ireland coach ) but not at this time , &quot; he added . 
Anderson was mooted in the Irish media as a possible replacement for Kidd who is beset by rumours that he faces the sack . 
the IRFU on Monday summoned Kidd to a meeting which , they said in a statement , would cover matters relating to the performance and the future preparation of the international team , who lost 39-27 to lowly Italy at Lansdowne Road on Saturday . 
since the start of last year &apos;s international championship , Ireland have lost six of seven matches under Kidd , including an embarrassing 40-25 defeat by Western Samoa . 
Ireland team manager Pat Whelan said after the Lansdowne Road debacle on Saturday that Ireland &apos;s play was &quot; devoid of any concerted or discernible pattern . 
Irish media on Tuesday said that former All-Black , Micke Brewer , may be appointed care-taker Ireland coach ahead of the meeting with France in a Five Nations championship game at Lansdowne Road on January 18 . 
brewer , player-coach at all-Ireland league division one club BlackRock College , is already part of the Irish set-up . 
he travelled with the Ireland squad on the winter break to Portugal in an advisory capacity .
