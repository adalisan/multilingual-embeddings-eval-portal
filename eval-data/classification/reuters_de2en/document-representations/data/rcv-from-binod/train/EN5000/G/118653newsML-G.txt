Japan &apos;s topsy-turvy politics could throw up another surprise in next Sunday &apos;s general election if , as seems increasingly possible , the Communist Party emerges as a key player . 
analysts say the Communists , whose very survival seemed threatened by the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 , could capitalise on voter discontent and increase their seats , setting off a rush by conservative groups to unify . 
with less radical left-wing parties like the Social Democrats in disarray and some polls forecasting a coalition as the most likely election result , the Japan Communist Party ( JCP ) may well be poised for a new and enhanced role . 
the Social Democrats , formerly the Socialists , have shared power in a bizarre left-right coalition with the pro-business Liberal Democratic Party since 1994 . 
&quot; If the Communist Party wins more seats , Japan &apos;s politics will be plunged into a new form of instability , &quot; said political analyst Minoru Morita . 
&quot; It would spark fear among all the non-Communist parties and prompt them to form an awkward unified front against the Communists , &quot; he added . 
some analysts predict the JCP , which is fielding 321 candidates , could win 50 seats in the new 500-seat Lower House . 
it had 15 seats in the 511-seat Lower House dissolved this month . 
the most it has ever held was the 41 seats won in 1979 . 
they said voters disenchanted with the main parties and unhappy with the status quo could vote for the Communists , who have at least been consistent in their policies during the past three years of turbulence in Japanese politics . 
&quot; The general public is not allergic to the Communist Party any more since the collapse of the Soviet Union , &quot; said Rei Shiratori of Tokai University in Tokyo . 
senior JCP official Kazuo Shii said his party planned to woo &quot; disaffected &quot; and &quot; undecided &quot; voters who polls indicate number more than half of Japan &apos;s 98 million voters . 
&quot; We are seeking cooperation from both reformists and conservatives who have no allegiance to any political party , &quot; he told a recent news conference . 
Japan &apos;s oldest political party was hit hard by the collapse of the Soviet Union , losing support in the early 1990s . 
but it bounced back this year to win mayoral elections in two Tokyo suburbs in what could be a pointer to Sunday &apos;s polls . 
in its election platform , the JCP promises to force U.S. troops out of Japan , scrap the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and nullify a planned sales tax rise . 
&quot; The government the general public really needs is one in which citizens , not business circles or the United States , play the leading role , &quot; said JCP Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa . 
&quot; Japan must have true freedom by being independent of foreign countries , &quot; Fuwa said in a recent campaign speech . 
the rape of a schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen on Okinawa last year ignited strong resentment at the presence of 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan -- an issue the JCP has exploited . 
a national survey by the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper last week showed 46 percent of voters support scrapping all U.S. bases . 
while vaguely advocating the consolidation and reduction of U.S. military bases in Japan , other parties basically support the Japan-U.S. military alliance . 
Japan &apos;s Communists broke with the leading Communist powers -- Moscow and Beijing -- in the 1960s , saying their principal ideological soul mate was the Vietnam of Ho Chi Minh . 
founded in 1922 , the JCP was repeatedly suppressed by the authorities in the years up to World War Two , only to be revived by its few remaining members after the war . 
the JCP , which refuses to accept campaign funds from the government or donations from business , is financed mainly by sales of the party newspaper Akahata or &quot; Red Flag &quot; . 
the paper &apos;s circulation , a good indicator of the party &apos;s popularity , has remained at 2.5 million for the past few years after reaching a peak of 3.5 million in 1980 .
