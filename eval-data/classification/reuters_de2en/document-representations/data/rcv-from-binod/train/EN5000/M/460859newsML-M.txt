Singapore bunker quotes rose in line with stronger cargo prices but demand remained thin , traders said . 
bunker 380-cst was quoted at $ 101 and 180-cst at $ 108- $ 109 per tonne , about $ 3-4 per tonne higher than Thursday &apos;s quotes . 
&quot; We have to raise offers as cargo prices are strong but the high offers are not attracting any buyers , &quot; said one major . 
&quot; The market is very quiet , &quot; he said . 
MDO and gas oil were priced at $ 190- $ 205 and $ 210- $ 220 per tonne respectively .
