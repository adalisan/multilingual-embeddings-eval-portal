Russia &apos;s opposition-dominated parliament , which is already pressing Boris Yeltsin to quit on health grounds , agreed on Tuesday to debate a new request to the president to investigate his chief aide for corruption . 
Viktor Ilyukhin , the communist chairman of the State Duma security committee , told reporters the lower house &apos;s business managers had agreed in principle to debate on Friday a motion alleging Kremlin Chief-of-Staff Anatoly Chubais might have broken laws barring officials from earning money privately . 
Chubais , who as architect of Yeltsin &apos;s free market reforms and privatisations is a prime target for the communists , was not immediately available for comment . 
he has strenuously denied previous accusations of financial irregularities . 
the Duma first urged Yeltsin to suspend the 41-year-old head of the Kremlin administration last autumn , just months after he was appointed following Yeltsin &apos;s re-election in July . 
Ilyukhin , who was also behind a motion to be debated on Wednesday calling on the president to step down on health grounds , said the Duma had had no response to that first move against Chubais and the latest motion aimed to reinforce it . 
many of Yeltsin &apos;s opponents say his pneumonia , coming so soon after a six-month absence for heart surgery , shows he is unfit to rule . 
they also complain Chubais has been running Russia in his absence as an unelected &quot; regent &quot; . 
the Duma &apos;s business managers will take a final decision on Thursday on whether Friday &apos;s plenary session should debate the motion that the house urge the president to investigate media allegations of financial impropriety by Chubais . 
Ilyukhin distributed photocopies of what purported to be a credit card statement for an account belonging to Chubais . 
Ilyukhin said they corroborated allegations that Chubais received significant payments in dollars during the time he was running Yeltsin &apos;s re-election campaign and after he was appointed to run the Kremlin administration in July . 
&quot; If A.B. 
Chubais actually received foreign currency funds for activity not linked to the fulfillment of his direct responsibilities as a civil servant , then this constitutes a crude violation of the Principles of State Service Act , &quot; the draft text of the address to president read . 
arguing that this could mean Chubais had &quot; taken bribes &quot; , it concluded : &quot; It is essential to make a legal evaluation of all these facts and take steps according to current legislation .
