Bundesbank council member Ernst Welteke said he believed there was room for further interest rate cuts , but no current reason to use this potential , a German magazine reported on Wednesday . 
no confirmation was available from the Hesse central bank of a report in the German investor magazine Boerse Online , in which Welteke said that key rates were low and long-term rates falling . 
he said there was therefore no pressing reason for a rate cut . 
it was not immediately clear when the interview had been conducted . 
Welteke called for the introduction of a stability pact to enforce close adherence to the Maastricht criteria after currency union . 
the pact would increase accountability in regard to fiscal discipline , he said . 
&quot; For example an automatic increase in value-added tax if fiscal policy is not solid . 
the pressure on politicians would be a lot greater , &quot; said Welteke . 
on the domestic front , Welteke said a proposed tax on share gains , currently under discussion in Bonn , could force many small investors to invest abroad and would lead to German finance officials working flat out to enforce the tax , which he described as &quot; crazy &quot; . 
Welteke went on to say that the German economy was not yet out of its current dip . 
&quot; Domestic orders and construction sector figures especially are not pointing to a recovery . 
there is positive impetus coming from the export sector , but not yet enough to boost investment , &quot; Welteke told Boerse Online . 
Welteke said that low interest rates and the calm currency markets meant that Germany had a good chance of reporting slightly higher growth in 1997 than in the current year . 
he said that , at the moment , there was no evidence of inflationary pressures either in Germany or in Europe as a whole . 
Welteke said that there was good reason for the Bundesbank to define a two-year target for money supply , but said that the Bundesbank would discuss the time-frame for the M3 question at its meeting on December 19 .
