most Asian countries have not lost their appeal to companies in the West searching for growing markets despite tougher economic times , a survey by Political &amp; Economic Risk Consultancy ( PERC ) said on Sunday . 
the poll conducted in late-January and early February asked executives in seven U.S. cities to rate 11 Asian countries on the basis of overall ease or difficulty of doing business . 
the survey by the Hong Kong-based consultancy showed that Hong Kong , which Britain hands back to China on July 1 , had resumed its number one position . 
&quot; The reality is that the economy has performed relatively well , inflation pressures have eased , labour turnover has lessened and company profits have held up well , &quot; it said . 
Singapore slipped to second place from its top position last year . 
&quot; Singapore &apos;s economy may be encountering more difficult times , but this has not in any way hurt the country &apos;s reputation for providing a pro-business environment , &quot; PERC said . 
the survey said Hong Kong was placed behind Singapore last year due to pessimism about its 1997 transition to China . 
Singapore was seen fundamentally strong but was criticised for stringent regulations , high costs and a shortage of labour . 
&quot; For manufacturing and construction companies , who are obliged to pay government levies for the privilege of using foreign labour , it is a particularly sore point , &quot; PERC said . 
&quot; Singapore certainly has a very hands-on government , not all aspects of which are appreciated by businessmen . 
countries which fell back on ratings included Vietnam , and to a lesser extent , South Korea . 
PERC said last year &apos;s grade for Vietnam reflected a sense of optimism , now cooling , that its diligent labour force could turn the country into the next Asian tiger . 
&quot; The actual experience of many foreign companies has not lived up to expectations ... Vietnam was rated by far the most difficult business environment of all the countries surveyed . 
South Korea &apos;s reputation for business dropped with labour strikes damaging export performance and blocked reform of the country &apos;s restrictive labour laws . 
North Korea &apos;s serious economic problems also raised the possibility of volatility in the North , a burden to the South at a time when the economy was poorly positioned to withstand it . 
ratings for Indonesia improved over the previous year and were seen &quot; surprisingly positive &quot; amid still common complaints by business executives , PERC said . 
respondents cited problems such as corruption , excessive controls on foreign business activity , business interest of the presidential family and difficulty of understanding how government laws and regulations were applied in practice . 
PERC said Malaysia &apos;s ratings also improved over 1996 but were still worse than expected . 
it said the country &apos;s boycott of British and Australian companies in the 1980s and early 1990s still gave executives the impression it was politically unstable , or potentially hostile to foreign investment . 
issues detracting from a pro-business environment were nationalism , controls on foreign companies , pro-Malay economic policies and the need to have good contacts .
