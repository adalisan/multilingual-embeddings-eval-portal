lower world prices for key Chilean commodity exports combined with a rise in imports were the main factors behind December &apos;s $ 201 million trade deficit , said the Central Bank in its fortnightly report . 
&quot; The trade deficit registered in Decmeber is due to a fall in the value of export shipments and an increase in the value of imports , &quot; said the report . 
the December figure brought Chile &apos;s trade deficit for 1996 to $ 1.2 billion compared with a surplus of $ 1.4 billion in the previous year .

Chilean exports came to $ 1.2 billion last month , of which copper accounted for $ 532 million . 
imports rose 16 percent in December to $ 1.44 billion bolstered by a 26 percent increase in the imports of capital goods .
