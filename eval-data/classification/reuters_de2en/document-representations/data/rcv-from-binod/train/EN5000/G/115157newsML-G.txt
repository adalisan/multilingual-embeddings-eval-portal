Belgium &apos;s highest court decided on Monday that a judge investigating a shocking case of child sex , kidnapping and murder had compromised himself and could not be allowed to continue the investigation . 
the Cour de Cassation said it upheld formal complaints from lawyers representing the two main defendants in the so-called Dutroux case in which four young girls have been found dead . 
the lawyers for convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux and Brussels businessman Michel Nihoul had said investigating magistrate Jean-Marc Connerotte had shown bias for the victims by attending a recent party for two girls rescued from Dutroux . 
under Belgian law an investigating magistrate must be strictly neutral in his quest for the truth . 
he must put together two case files , one with facts indicting a suspect and one with facts supporting any claims of innocence . 
on the basis of the files the public prosecutor must decide whether any charges will stand up in court . 
the complaints from the lawyers caused consternation among ordinary Belgians who have a high regard for Connerotte &apos;s successes in the Dutroux case and who saw his presence at the pasta party as an act of humanity .
