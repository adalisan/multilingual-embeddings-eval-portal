the main Dutch share index , the AEX , managed to set a new record close after struggling with losses for a large part of the trading session . 
the index ended 2.81 points higher at 738.23 , the ninth record close in a row and up from an intraday low of 729.95 . 
the midcap AMX index remained in negative territory throughout the day , and ended 8.69 points lower at 1109.09 . 
dealers said market players &apos; anxiety over current high price levels had increased volatility during the session , but added that the pause in the recent rally was healthy . 
&quot; It &apos;s a characteristic of this market . 
people jump upon anything to have an excuse to trade . 
it &apos;s good to slow down a little , &quot; one dealer said . 
trade in media group Elsevier topped the volume list , with the shares gaining over four percent to end at 30.90 guilders . 
some dealers attributed the rise to renewed rumours of a possible bid by news and information group Reuters Holdings plc for Reed International plc , the British parent company in the Anglo-Dutch Reed Elsevier group . 
one dealer said he had heard talk that Reuters was interested in Reed but not in Elsevier and that a demerged Elsevier might join up with Wolters Kluwer . 
Wolters shares closed 13.40 guilders higher at 249.90 . 
other dealers attributed the surge in the publisher shares to stock-picking and broker upgrades . 
Philips shares added 3.60 guilders to close at 84.80 guilders . 
&quot; There were a lot of American buyers following a meeting with investors there , &quot; one dealer said . 
another suggested belated research reports on the 1996 results might have triggered additional buying . 
dealers said U.K. buyers were behind the surge . 
Unilever plc was among 30 companies included in Goldman Sachs &apos; global priority list , which was launched today . 
dealers said the Amsterdam stock exchange was probably set for a brief pause following its recent surge . 
&quot; People are nervous . 
bid and offer spreads are getting wider , notably in the midcaps , amplifying the market &apos;s volatilty , &quot; one dealer said .
