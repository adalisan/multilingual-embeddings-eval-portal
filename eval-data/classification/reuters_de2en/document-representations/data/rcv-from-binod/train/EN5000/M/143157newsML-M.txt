against the pound , the rupee was quoted at a mean rate of 32.6975 from Thursday &apos;s 32.8565 . 
commercial bank dealers said the rupee &apos;s fixing versus the dollar was in-line with the U.S. currency &apos;s overnight trend . 
&quot; It &apos;s a combination mainly of the dollar &apos;s correction abroad and of the fact that the central bank intervened several times this week , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; The rupee is showing a tendency towards stabilisation . 
the central bank sold dollars in the interbank forex market last Monday , Wednesday and Thursday at a rate slightly lower than the prevailing interbank rate .
