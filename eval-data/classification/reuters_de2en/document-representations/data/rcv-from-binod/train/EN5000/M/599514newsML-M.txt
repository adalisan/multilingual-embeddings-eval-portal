Southeast Asian currency markets were mixed in a stable climate with the fall in the U.S. dollar lending support to the Singapore dollar , dealers said . 
the Singapore currency gained in line with the dollar &apos;s fall against the yen in the Asian morning , with funds unwinding length as dollar / yen slipped past 114 , they said . 
before the release of Singapore &apos;s April non-oil exports this afternoon , dealers said investors had squared positions . 
&quot; We are expecting April to be slightly negative to up one percent , better than previous months , &quot; a dealer with a U.S. bank said , noting this spurred buying of the sing dollar . 
dollar / sing fell to an estimated low of 1.4285 but was quoted at 1.4290 / 1.4300 at 0400 GMT . 
April non-oil exports released at 0358 GMT showed a higher increase of 5.9 percent on year , compared with 2.1 percent fall in March . 
a Reuter poll of 11 economists on Monday had predicted a tiny rise of 0.5 percent for April . 
a dealer with another U.S. investment house said the rise in the export figure would underpin the sing dollar and also cap dollar / sing rises at 1.4300 in the short-term . 
in Thailand , the baht improved with the weaker dollar and as foreign funds continued to raise short-term baht funds . 
dollar / baht fell to about 25.090 / 190 at 0400 GMT , down from the last fixing of the mid-rate by the Bank of Thailand at 25.78 per dollar on Monday . 
Thai currencies were seen calmer but with investors still wary of volatility after recent moves by Asian central banks to squeeze out speculators . 
&quot; Players are still trying to out-guess the fund shortage . 
the rate is well bid , especially on 6-months , &quot; the dealer said . 
Malaysia &apos;s ringgit recovered from an earlier low on renewed selling of dollar / ringgit as dollar / yen weakened . 
dealers said there was still speculation that Bank Negara intended to support the local currency around 2.4950 / 2.5000 , where many banks were lined up to sell dollars . 
foreign funds were seen trying to get out of their positions and the dollar would be sold on rallies against the ringgit . 
dollar / ringgit was at 2.4990 / 2.5000 . 
earlier , dealers said the ringgit was also pressured by sales for sing dollars , although some resistance was seen at the 0.5710 level . 
in Indonesia , the rupiah was steady with the focus on the forward market but remained vulnerable to further potential turmoil linked to the upcoming general election . 
markets were tense about bouts of violence at the weekend and rumours of troops , on alert for fresh clashes , firing warning shots overnight , dealers said . 
spot rupiah was quoted at 2,443.50 / 4.50 to the dollar at 0430 GMT , compared with Monday &apos;s 2,442.0 / 2,445.0 .
