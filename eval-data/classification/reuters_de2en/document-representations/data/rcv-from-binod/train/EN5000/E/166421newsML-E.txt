the structure of the monthly Australian Interest Rates poll has been been slightly altered this month due to the intense speculation of a monetary policy easing , particularly after recent benign prices and wages data . 
the Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) Board will meet on Tuesday . 
economists were asked just two questions ; the probabilty of of a cut in interest rates before the end of November in percentage terms , and before the end of the year . 
the survey of 33 economists showed the median forecast at 65 percent for a November easing and 80 percent by end-year .

economists were asked the same two questions last Friday , October 25 , after September quarter inflation showed the underlying rate at 2.4 percent , well within the RBA &apos;s 2.0-3.0 percent target , and August quarter average weekly earnings at 3.5 percent annually . 
the latter is also seen as well within the RBA &apos;s comfort zone . 
the median forecasts then was 60 percent for November , with a range of zero to 90 percent , and 75 percent for December , with a range of zero to 100 percent . 
while the inflation and wages data are seen as the key elements leading to a cut in current 7.0 percent official interest rates , in the past week the market has also seen unexpected sharp falls in both retail trade and building approvals data for September . 
these factors are also combined with a flat labour market , weak business trading conditions and a fall in consumer confidence . 
however , some economists feel the RBA will still want to see the extent of growth in enterprise bargaining agreements and capital expenditure data , both of which the bank showed concern in its quarterly the bulletin . 
latest reports on these are due sometime this month . 
however , expectations for an easing have risen since that fairly hawkish RBA Bulletin on October 16 . 
on October 18 economists were asked the chances of a cut before the end-November , and the median forecast then was just 47.5 percent , with a range of zero to 70 percent .
