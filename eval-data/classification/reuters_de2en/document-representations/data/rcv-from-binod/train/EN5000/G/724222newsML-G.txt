Dominique van roost saved two match points before beating Sandrine Testud in three sets to put Belgium level 1-1 in their Fed Cup semifinal against France on Saturday . 
Testud , ranked 20th in the world , went down 4-6 7-5 6-4 after serving for the match in the second set . 
Alexandra Fusai , unexpectedly chosen by captain Yannick Noah for the singles after Mary Pierce pulled out with an arm injury , put France in the lead when she beat Sabine Appelmans 6-7 6-3 6-1 . 
&quot; Things were going my way and I suddenly lost my concentration . 
at 5-3 there was a disputed call and I lost my calm . 
the Frenchwoman , who beat Monica Seles at Wimbledon , said she had struggled to adapt her game to clay . 
&quot; Fortunately Alexandra won , so nothing &apos;s lost &quot; , she added . 
Fusai , celebrating her first appearance for France , had the worst possible start against Appelmans , ranked 19th in the world , as she lost the opening three games . 
but she fought back , losing the first set only in a tie break before comfortably winning the next two . 
it will be the first appearance in a Fed Cup final for whichever team wins . 
if France win through they could still be without Pierce who said she was suffering from a similar injury to one which kept her out of action for three months last season . 
&quot; I &apos;m waiting to see whether I can resume playing in time for the tournaments in San Diego , Toronto and the U.S. Open , &quot; the former Australian Open winner said .
