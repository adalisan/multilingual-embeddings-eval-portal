London Metal Exchange ( LME ) three-months delivery copper slid to seven-month lows of $ 2,160 per tonne in quiet trading on Monday while the contango held at $ 4-6 in kerb trade . 
the sell-off which began on Friday continued to force prices down and analysts said they expected further losses . 
copper reached a low of $ 2,153 on Monday afternoon , down more than six percent on the high on Thursday of $ 2,297 . 
&quot; Funds became increasingly aware that the fundamentals for copper were very poor , &quot; said Robin Bhar of LME brokers Brandeis . 
Bhar said that copper would be susceptible to speculative surges and fluctuations due to localised periods of tightness , but that the general trend was down , with $ 2,000-2,100 expected in the next few months . 
aggressive selling of copper on Friday was triggered by a sharp fall in the US stock market which was a bad sign for metals , particularly copper , analysts said . 
investors would have sold bonds or commodities to compensate for losses on Wall Street , they added . 
the move into contango for copper indicated that the nearby shorts in the market were now covered and that the summer slowdown had gripped the market , according to Tariq Salaria , senior metals consultant at CRU International . 
LME stocks were expected to keep on rising to well above the current 264,600 tonnes , which is still around critical levels , Salaria said , adding that the market was &quot; definitely in surplus &quot; . 
an ebb and flow from backwardation to contango is expected until stocks reach a comfortable level of 350,000-400,000 tonnes , according to Bhar . 
the Chinese are expected to become buyers of copper at $ 2,100 , since they have depleted their cathode stockpiles and not yet buying in the spot market , Salaria said . 
however , Jim Lennon of Macquarie equities said that since China has bought copper concentrates , scrap and semis , &quot; large scale buying of refined copper is not required to meet demand needs in the near term &quot; . 
Macquarie estimates that China will need to import 150,000 tonnes of refined copper , less than half the 400,000 tonnes some analysts were expecting . 
&quot; The indications we have from China are that it will only buy when prices are below $ 2,200 . 
speculative interest deserted copper in favour of zinc and aluminium , analysts said . 
there was a &quot; clear decoupling between copper on the one hand , and zinc and aluminium on the other , &quot; according to Larry Kaplan of Flemings Research . 
&quot; The former appears to be in the grip of a senile and tired squeeze , the latter two in the grip of fresh and vigorous ones , &quot; he added . 
however , analysts said that all was not lost for copper , and some traders said that with physical business seen picking up in the fourth quarter , the market may soon tighten . 
&quot; copper has the propensity to bite back . 
it does have a sting in its tail , &quot; Bhar said .
