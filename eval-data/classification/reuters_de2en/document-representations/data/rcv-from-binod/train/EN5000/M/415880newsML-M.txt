German call money rates eased on Monday to 3.05 / 10 percent after the customary scramble by banks for funds to meet end-of-month reserve requirements had by late Friday pushed rates up to 3.50 percent . 
dealers said they were confident of a smooth start to the money market in March , with central bank balances seen as adequate to maintain current liquidity levels in the market at the start of the month . 
accordingly , no surprises were expected either at this week &apos;s repo tender or at the Bundesbank &apos;s regular council meeting , they added . 
comments earlier by Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer that he did not expect German interest rates to turn higher for some time confirmed that impression . 
deposits at the central bank eased on Friday to 43.9 billion marks from 45.6 billion , with the monthly average rising slightly to 41.0 billion . 
the Frankfurt Interbank overnight average on Monday slipped to 3.13167 from 3.84417 .
