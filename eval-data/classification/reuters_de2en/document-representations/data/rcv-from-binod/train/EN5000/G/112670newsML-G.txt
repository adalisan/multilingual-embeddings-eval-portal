President Bill Clinton &apos;s lead over Republican challenger Bob Dole has dropped to 10 points in the crucial state of California following the candidates &apos; debate , according to a poll published on Friday . 
this occurred despite the fact that , among those who watched or heard about the debate , twice as many believed that Clinton made the better overall impression . 
Clinton &apos;s lead in California -- which has 54 electoral college votes , more than any other state -- narrowed from 14 points before last Sunday &apos;s debate and from 22 points in September , immediately after the Democratic National Convention , according to the poll by the independent , San Francisco-based Field Institute . 
the poll found Clinton leading Dole by 48 to 38 percent in California after the debate , compared with a 49 to 35 percent lead just before the debate . 
it noted that Clinton &apos;s lead over Dole in California had ranged from 10 to 22 points over the past three months . 
in July , the president was ahead by 48 percent to 28 percent . 
but immediately after the Republican convention in August , his lead halved to 10 points ( 45 to 35 percent ) . 
the Democratic convention apparently gave Clinton a boost and he increased his lead to 22 points in September , when he was leading by 55 to 33 percent in California . 
reform Party candidate Ross Perot and Green Party candidate Ralph Nader each had the support of 3 percent of California voters in the latest poll while 8 percent were undecided or favoured other candidates . 
some 54 percent of California voters had a favourable impression of Clinton in the latest poll , down from 60 percent in September . 
forty-two percent viewed him unfavourably . 
dole had a favourable rating of 46 percent compared to 50 percent unfavourable , it said . 
among likely voters who said they watched , listened or heard about the debate , 48 percent said Clinton made a better overall impression compared to 23 percent who said Dole did . 
asked to rate specific aspects of the debate , a majority said Clinton appeared more presidential and more self-confident . 
Clinton also won in two other categories but 40 percent said Dole seemed more sincere compared with 32 percent who thought Clinton did . 
some 574 likely California voters were interviewed from October 1-6 before the presidential debate and 505 were polled from October 7-9 after the debate . 
the margin of error for both samples was 4.5 percentage points , it said .
