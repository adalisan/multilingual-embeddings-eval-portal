nearby CME lumber futures fell at the close on local selling while deferreds continued to narrow their discount to front months , traders said . 
futures had been slowly rising from sharp early losses on scattered pre-weekend short covering before dropping off at the closing bell . 
continued slow cash market trade and the weather-reduced pace of construction kept a lid on the market , traders said . 
the initial sharp break came on carryover sell stops from Thursday &apos;s limit decline in March and continued liquidation in January ahead of its expiration next Wednesday , they said . 
random lengths officially quoted cash spruce at $ 410 per tbf , unchanged from Wednesday and up $ 2 from last Friday .
