Belgium &apos;s Filip Dewulf became the first qualifier since John McEnroe at Wimbledon in 1977 to reach the semifinals of a grand slam tournament when he added Sweden &apos;s Magnus Norman to his list of victims on Tuesday . 
Dewulf , the first Belgian in the last four at Roland Garros for 39 years , again made a mockery of his world ranking of 122 by beating Norman 6-2 6-7 6-4 6-3 in a Centre Court encounter completed just seconds before rain swept across the stadium . 
Norman had beaten world number one Pete Sampras en route to the last eight but had no answer to the Belgian &apos;s powerful forehand which accounted for Spanish eighth seed Alex Corretja in the last round . 
&quot; If he keeps playing like that he has a good chance to win the tournament , &quot; Norman insisted . 
Dewulf has already won one tournament as a qualifier -- in Vienna in 1995 when he beat Thomas muster in the final -- but is just starting to realise what he has achieved in Paris . 
&quot; It &apos;s hard to explain but I started to feel out of place . 
&quot; Norman told me he thought I could win the tournament but it &apos;s going to be hard . 
I feel really tired , especially because of all the fuss surrounding me . 
in truth , Dewulf &apos;s victory was not a spectacle which will live long in the memory of the Roland Garros crowds . 
it was best summed up by events in the sixth game of the third set when Dewulf served three double faults in four points but still managed to avoid being broken . 
even so , the Belgian deserves credit for emerging on top against an opponent who sent down five times as many aces and now meets either defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov or Brazil &apos;s Gustavo Kuerten in the last four .
