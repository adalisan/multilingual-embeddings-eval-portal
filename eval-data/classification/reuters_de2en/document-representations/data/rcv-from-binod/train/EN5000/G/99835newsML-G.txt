the leader of a Kurdish guerrilla group fighting for self-rule in Turkey said he favours federalism rather than secession as a realistic aim for the Kurdish people , the al-Wasat weekly reported on Monday . 
in an interview with the Arabic-language weekly , Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) leader Abdullah Ocalan said he would approve of federalism for Kurds within the existing borders of Turkey , Iraq and Iran . 
&quot; insisting on secession is not in the interest of the Kurds . 
achieving ( Kurdish ) independence within the existing borders and living in freedom and equality with the other peoples is more realistic , &quot; Ocalan told the London-based publication . 
Ocalan has previously proposed federalism as a possible aim for the PKK , which for the past 12 years has waged an armed struggle against the Turkish state . 
more than 20,000 people have died in the fighting . 
in the interview , Ocalan expressed concern at the dealings of Iraqi Kurdish faction leader Massoud Barzani with Baghdad and Ankara , but said he hoped this would not bring an end to the ceasefire between the two groups . 
&quot; We hope that Mr Barzani will not submit to pressures from the Turkish state and will not take hostile stands against us , &quot; Ocalan said . 
he warned Barzani against aiding Turkey in its aim of setting up a security zone in northern Iraq , where the PKK has bases it uses to stage attacks on Turkey . 
Barzani &apos;s Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) , backed by Iraqi troops and tanks , captured the Kurdish city of Arbil in northern Iraq from a rival militia late in August . 
Barzani later held talks with Turkish officials about the new situation in northern Iraq .
