Republican Bob Dole , suffering a backlash from his campaign &apos;s abortive attempt to woo third party candidate Ross Perot , hit the road on Saturday in California where Bill Clinton has a major lead . 
the president , meanwhile , took a one-day break from the campaign to celebrate his wife &apos;s 49th birthday after recording a regular Saturday radio speech on crime issues that made no mention of the Nov . 5 election or his struggling opponent . 
in a broadcast response , Elizabeth Dole sought to counter Clinton &apos;s attacks on the Medicare issue with assurances that her husband , as president , would guard the government healthcare programme for the elderly . 
&quot; You can trust Bob to protect and preserve Medicare for your parents , just as he did for his parents , &quot; she said . 
dole , whom every national poll has said is lagging well behind Clinton , suffered a rebuff this week when Perot brusquely rejected an appeal from the Dole campaign to quit the race and support the Republican . 
the episode , and a hard-hitting televised speech in which he blasted Clinton on ethics issues , appeared to have given Perot a lift in the polls at Dole &apos;s expense . 
results from a tracking poll conducted for Reuters by John Zogby Group International and issued on Saturday showed that Dole had dropped to 33.6 percent from 35.2 percent on Friday , while Perot had a surge to 7.8 percent from 6 percent following a rise of .7 percent from Thursday . 
Clinton , with 46.7 percent , led Dole by 13.1 points , a 2 percent widening of the gap between the two . 
&quot; Dole has been particularly hurt by the awkward overture to Perot , &quot; pollster Zogby said . 
but Dole appeared upbeat during a stop of his bus caravan in the agriculural region of Visalia , California , telling a large crowd , &quot; I smell victory in California . 
the state is the nation &apos;s biggest campaign prize , with 54 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency . 
although a Los Angeles Times poll earlier this week showed Dole trailing by a 20-point margin in the state , Dole spokesman Nelson Warfield said the campaign &apos;s internal polling showed &quot; a lot of reason for confidence in California . 
&quot; He did not elaborate . 
dole continued his theme of attacking Clinton on ethics , saying the press had failed to go after the president on the issue . 
&quot; Where is the outrage ? 
where is the outrage ? 
&quot; he asked . 
dole also repeated charges that the White House was rushing through naturalisation of legal aliens so they could vote on election day &quot; even if they had criminal records . 
&quot; That is an outrage . 
that is an outrage , &quot; he declared . 
the FBI has said that 10 percent of immigrants showed up on FBI files but that this did not indicate they had criminal records . 
there has been an upsurge in naturalisation applications , apparently resulting partly from new laws restricting government benefits to legal aliens . 
in his radio address President Clinton urged states to earmark $ 44 million from a federal crime fund to help pay the costs for victims of gang violence . 
he said the nation needed to &quot; stand up for the rights and interests of crime victims . 
under the Justice Department &apos;s Crime Victims Fund , money from fines , penalty assessments and bond forfeitures paid for federal crimes is distributed to states to compensate victims for such costs such as unpaid medical bills , mental health counselling , funeral expenses and lost wages . 
Clinton proposed that states use 10 percent of two recent fines totalling $ 440 million and direct it toward victims of gang violence . 
the Republican party has long been seen as the party tough on crime , but Clinton and the Democrats have made a major effort to remove the issue as a campaign factor .
