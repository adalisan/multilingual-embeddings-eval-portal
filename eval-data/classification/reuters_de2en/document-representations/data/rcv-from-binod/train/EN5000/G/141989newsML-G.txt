British heart and lung surgeon Keith Ramstead was found guilty on one of three counts of manslaughter by a New Zealand court on Thursday . 
the foreman of the jury at the High Court in Wellington said it found Ramstead guilty of the manslaughter of an elderly woman , Nancie Muncie , on whom he performed a lung removal operation when working in New Zealand in 1992 . 
however , Ramstead &apos;s lawyer David Collins told reporters no conviction had been entered and a further hearing had been tentatively set for November 1 to address certain issues , which he did not specify . 
it was not clear if or when Ramstead would be sentenced . 
Ramstead was cleared of two further counts of manslaughter and one charge of making a false statement about a death . 
the jury failed to bring down a decision on a second charge of making a false statement . 
Ramstead looked pale but showed no emotion as the verdicts were delivered . 
during the 4-1 / 2 week trial , the prosecution alleged Ramstead failed to use the reasonable standard of knowledge , skill and care of a competent thoracic surgeon and so caused the deaths of two men , aged 50 and 74 , and Muncie . 
all died on the operating table at a Christchurch hospital . 
using diagrams to illustrate Ramstead &apos;s alleged mistakes , prosecutor Brent Stanaway said in his closing address on Monday that Ramstead &apos;s defence was built on his own evidence about what happened and this evidence had been shown to be both unreliable and dishonest . 
however , in his closing address on Tuesday , defence laywer Collins said the prosecution &apos;s case was &quot; fundamentally flawed &quot; because its theories ignored facts . 
&quot; During the course of this trial we have seen a number of experts ... change their minds on very fundamental points , &quot; Collins said . 
the 44-year-old Liverpool surgeon returned voluntarily to New Zealand to stand trial after an extradition action was started in April 1994 . 
it took the jury of six men and six women 24 hours of deliberation spread over three days to reach a decision . 
the trial involved detailed medical testimony of numerous medical professionals for both the prosecution and defence , with often conflicting views on crucial details of the operations . 
&quot; Rarely has a case of such complexity been put before New Zealand juries , &quot; defence counsel Collins told the court .
