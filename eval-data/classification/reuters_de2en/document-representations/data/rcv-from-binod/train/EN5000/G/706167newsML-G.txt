Chancellor Helmut Kohl held talks on Thursday ( corrects from Friday ) with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine , making his first visit to Bonn as a member of Lionel Jospin &apos;s new Socialist-led government . 
officials said the talks were expected to focus on next week &apos;s summit on NATO expansion in Madrid and preparations for European economic and monetary union ( EMU ) . 
the talks took place just as French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn told reporters in Paris that France &apos;s public deficit could be &quot; significantly higher &quot; than 3.0 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) . 
the Maastricht Treaty says countries which want to take part in EMU must not have a budget deficit of more than three percent of GDP . 
Kohl , the driving force behind the project , has reiterated in the past few days that &quot; three &quot; means 3.0 . 
Vedrine was due to hold further consultations with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel in the afternoon . 
the ministers were due to hold a joint news conference at 1530 GMT after taking a boat trip on the Rhine and meeting local schoolchildren . 
officials said the ministers planned to issue a joint declaration on further strengthening Franco-German foreign policy cooperation .
