an early rally on the Prague bourse , driven by a government victory in a confidence vote on Tuesday , stalled quickly on Wednesday as the market refocused on wider economic problems and poor market regulation , dealers said . 
the PX50 index closed up just 0.1 percent to 506.9 after rising 0.5 percent at the morning fixing . 
&quot; The rally wasn &apos;t going to last long . 
it &apos;s good that the government won the confidence vote on Tuesday night but how does this affect the economic slowdown or shareholder protection , &quot; said one dealer who requested anonymity . 
Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus on Tuesday evening won a vote of confidence in his government by just two votes . 
dealers had widely predicted the victory and said it was now up to the government to deliver on the promises it has made to reform the capital markets , restructure companies and push on with privatisation . 
&quot; Now it is time to get back to work and clean up the markets , stop corruption ... it is the government &apos;s job to do this , &quot; said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company . 
turnover was lower as the index &apos;s two biggest issues CEZ and SPT Telecom have been both temporarily suspended from trading because of annual general meetings .
