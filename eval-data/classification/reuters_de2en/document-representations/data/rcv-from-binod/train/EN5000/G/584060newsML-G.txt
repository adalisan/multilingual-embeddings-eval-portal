a split within Austria &apos;s coalition government over NATO membership widened further on Wednesday after conservative ministers resolutely backed ditching neutrality and joining the Western military alliance . 
senior figures in the centre-right People &apos;s Party , including Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel and Defence Minister Werner Fasslabend , have declared publicly at meetings in Europe over the past month that Austria should now seriously consider NATO entry . 
&quot; It is my belief that it is only a matter of time until we come to full membership , otherwise Austria loses all possibility of influencing major decisions , &quot; Fasslabend told reporters in Paris on Tuesday . 
he underscored his remarks in an interview published in the Kurier daily on Wednesday , describing Austria as an outsider unable to influence decisions within the European Union on defence and security policy . 
&quot; Austria can take part , it can pay , but it cannot say anything , &quot; said Fasslabend , who once described Austria &apos;s post-World War Two neutrality as an anachronism . 
Chancellor Viktor Klima and his dominant Social Democrats have adopted a wait-and-see policy , insisting the time is not ripe for full NATO membership . 
Fasslabend disagrees . 
&quot; Waiting cannot be the theme running through Austria &apos;s security and foreign policy . 
we should have been in NATO before our neighbours , &quot; he told the Kurier . 
the NATO debate surfaced in Austria after the country joined the EU in 1994 and has intensified as the 16-member alliance moves closer to naming former Warsaw Pact states as new members at a summit in Madrid in July . 
Hungary and the Czech Republic -- two of Austria &apos;s neighbours -- and Poland are the frontrunners for the first wave of NATO expansion . 
Slovenia , another of Austria &apos;s neighbours , may also be included . 
political analysts believe a deal on a peaceful new relationship between NATO and Russia struck in Moscow on Wednesday , signalling a possibly smoother road to expansion , may further focus minds across Europe . 
John Roper , associate fellow at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London , said the next round of NATO expansion may not be aimed at former communist states , but at &quot; the EU neutrals &quot; , Austria , Finland and Sweden . 
neutral Ireland presented a more complex question because of the Northern Ireland issue , he said . 
&quot; We could see Austria , Sweden and Finland in a new enlargement , possibly next year or in 1999 , &quot; Roper said . 
he said Swedish conservative leader Carl Bildt , who had a good chance of winning next year &apos;s general election , was likely to push for NATO membership and that would have a knock-on effect on neighbouring Finland . 
while Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen insisted last year that Helsinki was not seeking NATO membership , his defence minister , Anneli Taina , said in January the country may have to review its position before a general election in 1999 . 
Roper said there was unlikely to be any real progress made on defence in the current EU inter-governmental conference but a move to embrace more EU nations into NATO would smooth the road to a common European security policy . 
&quot; It would also send a message to other countries like the Baltic states that the time to think again ( about joining NATO ) is when they come into the EU , &quot; he said .
