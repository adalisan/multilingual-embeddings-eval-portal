the New Zealand economy steamed ahead for its 17th quarter of straight gains in December , Statistics New Zealand ( SNZ ) said on Thursday . 
not only was real , seasonally adjusted GDP growth for the quarter at the top end of expectations at 0.7 percent , but there are strong signs the pace of growth will pick up . 
the economy grew a seasonally adjusted 2.9 percent in 1996 and by 20.4 percent since the September 1992 quarter when the growth phase began . 
the growth run is by far the longest since SNZ began compiling the series in 1977 . 
the previous best streak ended after six quarters of growth in June 1979 . 
reserve Bank Governor Don brash last week noted that New Zealand appeared to have achieved the proverbial &quot; soft landing &quot; , as the growth rate came down from 6.8 percent in the March 1994 year to a low of 2.3 percent in the June 1996 year . 
bankers Trust Chief Economist David plank said the December quarter data suggested clearly that the economy turned up quite strongly from the middle of last year . 
he said there was no doubt that the Treasury &apos;s more bullish growth forecasts were proving more reliable than the Reserve Bank &apos;s . 
&quot; Growth now is going to be more than 3.0 percent in the year to March , which is bang on line with Treasury and the Reserve Bank is at 1.8 percent , &quot; plank said . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think there is any doubt that Treasury &apos;s view of the real economy is more correct than the Reserve Bank &apos;s . 
&quot; If we are over the worst then it &apos;s a very good outcome -- a very soft landing . 
it will be interesting to see whether we can achieve the same result over the next couple of years . 
Treasury in December forecast the economy would grow by 3.6 percent in 1997 / 98 , 3.1 percent in 1998 / 99 and 3.5 percent in 1999 / 2000 . 
the new centre-right coalition government plans to stimulate the economy with a NZ $ 5 billion ( US $ 3.5 billion ) spending package over the next three years and that is expected to fuel domestic consumption , which lagged in the latest data . 
economists said the December quarter data was mixed for financial markets -- on balance slightly negative for bonds . 
but markets are obsessed with overseas trends at present and took little note . 
despite a 14.6 percent rise in the New Zealand dollar Trade-Weighted Index over the year , growth has been fuelled by exports , particularly in manufacturing in the dairy sector , SNZ said . 
there were both positives and negatives for the market according to First NZ Capital economist Jason Wong . 
&quot; The output figure is a negative for the Reserve Bank but on the other side you have higher productivity than most people thought . 
&quot; Overall I think it is slightly negative for the market but not overly so .
