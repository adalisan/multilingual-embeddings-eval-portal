Switzerland on Friday acknowleged it had struck a confidential deal with Poland in 1949 to liquidate Poles &apos; unclaimed wealth in Swiss banks , but denied the pact had let it keep Holocaust victims &apos; riches for itself . 
the arrangement was detailed in an exchange of letters dated June 25 , 1949 but not published along with a compensation treaty concluded at the same time , the Foreign Ministry in Berne said . 
it released copies of the letters , in which the senior Swiss negotiator accepts Warsaw &apos;s proposal that Polish citizens &apos; Swiss bank accounts and life insurance policies that go unclaimed for five years to be turned over to Poland &apos;s central bank . 
the letters were in conjunction with the previously publicised accord under which Poland was to pay Switzerland 52.1 million Swiss francs in compensation for property the then-Communist Polish regime had nationalised . 
the revelation of the letters was sure to turn up pressure on Switzerland to clear up once and for all the fate of Jewish wealth deposited by people who perished in Nazi death camps . 
the foreign ministry statement said the letters did not support U.S. 
Senator Alfonse D &apos;Amato &apos;s assertion that the 1949 accord let Switzerland divert for itself the unclaimed wealth of Polish Jews who died at Hitler &apos;s hands . 
&quot; Various sides alleged yesterday that Switzerland struck a secret accord with Poland after World War Two that allowed Switzerland to seize for itself dormant assets of Polish citizens , &quot; the ministry said . 
&quot; This allegation is wrong . 
it said it was trying to clear up unresolved questions about post-war compensation agreements with Bulgaria , Czechoslovakia , Yugoslavia , Romania and Hungary , especially over if , when and how much it paid foreign governments . 
as more documents trickled out , the Swiss Bankers Association said it had discovered a 1950 memo it had circulated drawing banks &apos; attention to the 1949 exchange of letters and asking how much money was at stake . 
it did not give a figure . 
Swiss banks have never disputed they were a popular refuge for the wealth of European Jews fearing Nazi persecution after Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933 . 
many were drawn by Switzerland &apos;s strict bank secrecy and neutral status . 
but the banks reject claims by the World Jewish Congress that they may be sitting on billions of dollars in assets left behind by Jewish account holders murdered in the Holocaust without having passed along their secret bank details . 
Swiss banks and officials insist they are doing their utmost to check allegations about Holocaust accounts that have drawn international attention and damged Switzerland &apos;s reputation as a financial centre . 
a Swiss banking ombudsman is helping nearly 1,000 claimants track down any lost Holocaust accounts that may have escaped two previous sweeps of their records . 
a separate panel agreed by Swiss bankers and Jewish groups in May and headed by former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker is also checking whether banks did all they could to locate Holocaust victims &apos; accounts . 
Volcker told reporters after the panel met in Zurich that the group was making good progress and hoped to hire auditors soon to start going over bank books to search for lost assets of Hitler &apos;s victims . 
&quot; If this ( search ) is not done by the middle of 1998 I will be very disappointed , but I cannot promise that , &quot; he said . 
Parliament is also set to agree in December the formation of a panel of experts empowered to lift banking secrecy and conduct a five-year review of Swiss financial links to the Nazis . 
it will also review the fate of Nazi victims &apos; wealth .
