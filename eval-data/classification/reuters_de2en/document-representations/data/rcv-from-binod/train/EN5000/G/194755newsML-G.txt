the Norwegian embassy in Jakarta has issued East Timorese Nobel laureate Bishop Carlos Belo a visitor &apos;s visa so he can collect his 1996 peace prize at a ceremony next month , an embassy official said on Saturday . 
Norwegian Ambassador Jan Hegg told Reuters Belo collected his visa this week when he visited Jakarta for a church conference . 
&quot; It is specifically for ( the Nobel Prize ) , &quot; Hegg said . 
Belo , who spends most of his time in East Timor , some 2,000 km ( 1,200 miles ) east of Jakarta , has yet to confirm whether he will attend the prize-giving ceremony on December 10 in Oslo . 
last month , Belo jointly won the prize with self-exiled East Timorese independence movement spokesman Jose Ramos Horta .
