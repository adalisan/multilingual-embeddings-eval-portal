shares in Royal Bank of Scotland plc dropped in early trading on Wednesday as the group posted first-half profits no better than analysts had expected , dealers and analyts said . 
the stock was down 9-1 / 2p at 576 by 0819 GMT in active trade of 2.1 million shares . 
pre-tax profit rose 14 percent to 369 million stg in the six months to March 31 , compared with analyst expectations mostly in a range between 345 million stg and 383 million . 
analysts and dealers said the bank &apos;s UK results showing a 24 percent rise in UK banking profits were strong yet the result overall was no better than expected , a slight disappointment after recent positive surprises in UK bank results . 
Bank of Scotland plc , up 1 / 2p at 393 , for instance last month posted a better-than-expected 22 percent rise in pre-tax profits to 664.1 million stg . 
&quot; Maybe expectations for the Royal Bank &apos;s results crept up following the Bank of Scotland results , &quot; said Ian Poulter , analyst at Williams de Broe . 
&quot; The results are OK and the UK within that is looking good ... but it is a bit like damning with faint praise . 
dealers pointed out that Royal Bank shares had risen sharply since the middle of last month , in line with general gains in the bank sector . 
at yesterday &apos;s close the stock was up 12 percent in the past four weeks . 
&quot; They have had a good run and we are just seeing some profit-taking , &quot; said one market-maker . 
chairman Lord younger said the first-half results and the &quot; ... excellent progress made in developing both existing and new businesses provide a firm foundation from which the group can move forward with confidence .
