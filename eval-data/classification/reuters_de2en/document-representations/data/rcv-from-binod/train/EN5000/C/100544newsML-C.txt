the Dutch ministry of economic affairs said on Monday news U.S. truck-maker Paccar Inc planned a bid worth 933 million guilders for Daf trucks NV appeared on first examination to be positive . 
another 10 percent is held by the government of the Belgian region of Flanders and the rest by banks and institutional investors . 
&quot; The minister &apos;s first response to this bid is positive but it will be a few weeks before a decision , &quot; said a spokesman . 
the spokesman said economics affairs minister Hans Wijers was likely to seek a &quot; fairness opinion &quot; from a group of financial advisors who would go over the Paccar bid and give their opinion of the merits of the offer . 
Wijers would also take into account industrial and political factors when making his decision about the Dutch state &apos;s stake . 
&quot; Price will be important of course , but he will weigh up the bid from the point of industrial policy -- that there will still be a truck company in the Netherlands which is embedded in our industrial and technical structure , &quot; said the spokesman .
