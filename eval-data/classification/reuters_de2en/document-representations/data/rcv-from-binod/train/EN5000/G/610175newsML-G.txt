a top European official , seeking to dispel lingering doubts over the timing of monetary union , on Friday declared the euro on track to start in January 1999 and said most EU member states were likely to join it . 
European Monetary Affairs Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy , predicting a new era of European stability and growth under the euro , also praised Italy &apos;s belt-tightening efforts and said Rome was moving in the right direction for entry . 
&quot; The process is irreversible and the euro will be in place on January 1 , 1999 , &quot; he told Reuters during a visit to Geneva . 
&quot; If we want to change the date , we have to change the ( Maastricht ) treaty . 
now the process is so advanced that it &apos;s not possible for member states and companies to slow down . 
de Silguy said Maastricht Treaty economic principles would be applied strictly for a smooth transition to monetary union . 
Nations hoping to join should stick to the criteria , including a curb on budget deficits to three percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) this year , he said . 
he declined to comment on Germany &apos;s plan to plug its budget gap by revaluing gold reserves , but warned against accounting tricks by European Union member states . 
&quot; For countries participating in the euro , the most important thing is to achieve a sustainable level of convergence . 
accounting measures must be complemented with structural measures to achieve sound finances in the long term , but creative accounting is out of the question , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There are precise regulations known by everyone , &quot; he said . 
&quot; They will be applied . 
there is no question of doing creative accounting . 
we will apply the same accountability rules to all member states without discrimination . 
de Silguy expected a majority of EU states to qualify for the first round of European economic and monetary union ( EMU ) but did not elaborate . 
&quot; When I see the huge efforts made by governments of all the member states to be ready in time , the evolution of economic situations , I think there &apos;ll be a majority of member states which will be ready to join the EMU at the start , &quot; he said . 
asked if Italy would qualify by 1999 , he said : &quot; Italy is moving in the right direction . 
Italy has made fantastic efforts to reduce excessive public deficits and prepared reforms to be ready in due time . 
de Silguy said the common European currency should fuel growth in Europe to an estimated four percent a year from 2.5 percent now , foster stability and help slash unemployment to eight percent from 12 percent now . 
he dismissed fears the Swiss franc would appreciate sharply because of concerns about the stability of the euro and said such risks in a transition period would be minimised . 
&quot; Banks and Swiss businesses must prepare themselves for the introduction of the euro because it will have important consequences for them , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The euro will be a stable currency and the Swiss franc will indirectly benefit from this stability .
