various forms of enlarged-heart diseases , which have killed popular athletes , may be helped by a common treatment despite having genetically different causes , University of Pennsylvania researchers reported Wednesday . 
researchers at the university &apos;s Pennsylvania Medical Centre reported in the December issue of &quot; The Journal of Clinical Investigation &quot; that the disease , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , or HCL , afflicted the heart through similar ways regardless of its specific genetic cause . 
the disease killed basketball stars Hank gathers and Reggie Lewis and is the leading cause of sudden death among young adults , the medical centre said in a release . 
&quot; mutations in a number of genes have been linked to the disease , complicating the search for the exact cause ... and for possible treatments , &quot; it said . 
the author of the study , associate physiology professor H. Lee Sweeney , said &quot; This work implies that if there is a common functional problem , irrespective of which gene is defective , then one type of treatment may work for all hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients . 
&quot; The solution to treating the disease may lie in blocking or decreasing the signals in the heart that cause it to enlarge , &quot; Sweeney said . 
the medical centre said the differing forms of the disease all reduced power to the heart muscle , which stimulated the heart to enlarge , placing it at risk of failure .
