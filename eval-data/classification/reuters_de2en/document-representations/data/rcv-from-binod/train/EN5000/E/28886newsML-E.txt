Bulgaria &apos;s latest crisis has put investors on edge again , as the International Monetary Fund postponed a loan payment after the nation delayed fulfilling some structural reform goals . 
a free-falling currency , soaring interest rates and dwindling foreign currency reserves have raised concerns about Bulgaria &apos;s ability to pay its domestic and international debts . 
the IMF decided to postpone disbursement of the second $ 115 million tranche of its loan from September to October at the earliest -- if Bulgaria succeeds in meeting some of the targets outlined in the agreement with the IMF . 
&quot; The delay of the next IMF disbursement could have an impact on their ability to roll over their local T-bills , &quot; warned Lawrence Brainard , head of emerging markets research at Chase Securities Inc . 
but he added that worries about defaults on Bulgarian Bradies are premature , since the next payment is not due until next January . 
unlike Mexico &apos;s peso crisis in late 1994 , Bulgaria &apos;s problems have been all out in the open , said James Barrineau , an emerging markets fixed income analyst at Smith Barney . 
with no rich foreign government ready to bail it out , Bulgaria can only look to the IMF for relief , which makes its compliance to the accords all the more crucial , he said . 
investors responded with predictable panic when the IMF pronouncements on Bulgaria have been overwhelmingly negative for the past two weeks , he said . 
Bulgaria , for a lack of alternatives , is likely to try hard to work with the IMF , but showing &quot; good faith &quot; is not enough to satisfy the IMF mission , Barrineau said . 
Joyce Chang , manager of emerging markets research at Merrill Lynch and Co Inc , said foreign investors would monitor closely the progress of the Bulgarian government in meeting IMF requirements , such as selling loss-ridden state enterprises , before the October disbursement . 
&quot; The next few weeks will be crucial , &quot; she said , noting that a Merrill research report out of London put the chance of IMF leasing funds at 60 percent . 
Bulgaria is torn between printing money to meet domestic debt payments and adhering to the IMF &apos;s stringent guidelines on controling inflation and the fiscal deficit , Chang said . 
but she said clinching an IMF deal this summer puts Bulgaria on firmer footing than it stood on in March when doubts about the July Brady payments roiled the market . 
Ingrid Iverson , Brady bond strategist at UBS Securities , noted that Bulgaria &apos;s problems are nothing new and contended the latest selloff in response to the IMF disbursement delay was overdone . 
Iverson said the depressed prices offered some bottom-fishing opportunities . 
Bulgaria Bradies are currently the cheapest assets in the Bradies market , with spreads widening some 100 basis points since Friday . 
&quot; It &apos;s much too soon to talk about Brady default , &quot; Iverson said . 
but investors were cautious , preferring the IAB , which holds value better in a decline , to the FLIRB , which appreciates faster on the rebound , she added . 
spreads of stripped yields of Bulgarian Bradies ranged from 1500 to 1700 basis points , compared to the next widest spreads of about 1,300 points for Ecuador papers .
