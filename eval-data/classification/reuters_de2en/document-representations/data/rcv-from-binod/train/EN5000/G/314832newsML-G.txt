Chinese police arrested more than 110,000 people for drugs-related crimes and solved more than 87,000 narcotics cases in 1996 , the Xinhua news agency said on Friday . 
police seized more than four tonnes of heroin , more than 1.7 tonnes of opium and more than one tonne of amphetamines , or &quot; ice &quot; , last year , Xinhua quoted officials at a national conference on banned drugs as saying . 
&quot; There is an international flood of drugs , the numbers of domestic drug users are growing daily , and drugs pose a serious threat to our country , &quot; Xinhua quoted the conference as concluding . 
however , drugs crimes had soared , with China busting 87,000 drugs-related cases in 1996 compared with 57,500 the year before , the Xinhua figures showed . 
police arrested 110,000 people last year , up from 73,700 offenders in 1995 . 
in 1995 , authorities confiscated nearly 2.4 tonnes of heroin and 1.1 tonnes of opium . 
the southwestern provinces of Yunnan , Sichuan and Guangxi , Guangdong and Hunan in the south , and Gansu in the north -- all hotbeds of drug activity -- had launched special wars on drugs , Xinhua said . 
the conference called for strict punishment of those convicted of drugs crimes , which carry the death penalty , and urged citizens to be more aware of drugs , Xinhua said . 
China often executes drug dealers at public rallies and forces addicts into harsh military-style rehabilitation camps . 
drug abuse , once nearly wiped out under the stern puritan rule of Mao Zedong , has made a comeback in China following economic reforms that have loosened the central government &apos;s control over society . 
drug addiction in China had soared recently , with the latest figures showing the number of registered addicts jumping by at least 37 percent in 1995 . 
Chinese drug experts have said the total number of addicts could be as high as one million , with most now favouring heroin over opium , once China &apos;s traditional narcotic of choice . 
cartels operating from the Golden Triangle where Burma , Laos and Thailand meet have increasingly used China as a transit route for drug shipments to Hong Kong and on to the West .
