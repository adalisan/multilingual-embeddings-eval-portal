suspected Moslem rebels killed 40 people , including five-month-old twin babies , in the latest attacks on civilians in Algeria , Algerian newspapers said on Sunday . 
twenty-one villagers were killed by having their throats cut overnight Thursday-Friday when suspected rebels stormed Tabouza hamlet in Medea province , 70 km ( 45 miles ) south of Algiers , said Liberte and Al Khabar dailies . 
among the dead were five-month-old twin babies , four women and three elderly men , they said . 
a homemade bomb exploded near a mosque crowded with faithful shortly before Moslem Friday mass prayers killing 10 people and wounding 20 in Djelfa , 230 km ( 140 miles ) south of Algiers , El Watan newspaper said . 
Al Khabar and Liberte put the death toll from the bomb at between seven and 11 . 
the newspapers said the bomb went off in a playground near the mosque in a neighbourhood named after president Mohamed Boudiaf , who was assassinated by a government security officer in June 1992 . 
suspected guerrillas slashed the throats of eight civilians , including five women overnight Thursday-Friday in Sidi Bakhti hamlet in Tiaret province , 220 km ( 135 miles ) east of Algiers , Al Khabar said . 
the rebels flogged a man in the same village a night later and then cut his throat , the daily said without giving further details . 
the same night , suspected rebels set ablaze a bakery in Imsouhal village in Tizi-Ouzou province , 90 km ( 60 miles ) east of Algiers , and stole the baker &apos;s car , it added . 
Al Khabar said the arson was to punish the owner for his refusal to pay money in a &quot; protection racket &quot; run by rebels in the area . 
the killings , the latest in a series of massacres of villagers and other attacks , brought to more than 700 the number of civilians killed in the past two months in rebel attacks . 
Algerian leaders after keeping silent on the violence vowed last week to pursue &quot; implacably &quot; the govermnent &apos;s struggle to wipe out the guerrillas . 
government forces , meanwhile , killed 18 rebels in Haouch Miller area near Larba , 25 km ( 15 miles ) south of Algiers in the past 48 hours , said Al Khabar . 
the rebel dead brought to 29 the number shot in the area in a continuing military offensive . 
troops killed more than 300 rebels in a massive offensive in Blida province in July , according to Algerian reports . 
newspaper commentators said the rebels stepped up their massacres of villagers in remote hamlets to avenge their dead and boost the guerrillas &apos; morale after the offensive . 
about 60,000 people have died in Algeria &apos;s violence since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead .
