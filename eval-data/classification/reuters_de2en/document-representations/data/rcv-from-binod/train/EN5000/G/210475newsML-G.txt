the number of newborn infants who contracted AIDS from their mothers declined 27 percent between 1992 and 1995 , U.S. health officials said on Thursday . 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said the change came because more pregnant women were tested for HIV and , if the test was positive , took the drug zidovudine ( AZT ) to reduce the chance of transmitting it to their babies . 
it estimated that 663 newborn infants acquired AIDS from their mothers in 1995 . 
the figure has been declining every year since 1992 , when 905 infants were diagnosed as perinatally infected . 
there was a decline of 8 percent in perinatal AIDS cases among infants from 1993 to 1994 and a drop of 17 percent from 1994 to 1995 . 
Lindegren called the decrease &quot; extremely encouraging early news about the impact of Public Health Service recommendations for the use of zidovudine and women accepting HIV testing during pregnancy . 
a CDC study found zidovudine use rose from 17 percent to 80 percent among HIV-infected pregnant women after the Public Health Service issued guidelines recommending the use of the drug during pregnancy and childbirth . 
the guidelines also urge that babies of HIV-infected women be given zidovudine for six weeks after birth . 
Lindegren said it was not known if zidovudine &apos;s greatest value was in reducing viral transmission in the womb or during delivery or because it protects a newborn who might become infected through breast-feeding . 
&quot; We think most of the transmission occurs during Labor and delivery , &quot; he said . 
researchers found in 1994 that giving pregnant women zidovudine could reduce by two-thirds the chance they would transmit the AIDS virus to their babies . 
the rest for whom a cause was known were infected through contaminated blood or blood products .
