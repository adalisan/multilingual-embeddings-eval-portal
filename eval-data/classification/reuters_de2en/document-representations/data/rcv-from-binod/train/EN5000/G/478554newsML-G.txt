Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino went to Albania &apos;s rebel-held south on Tuesday for the first time since insurgents seized control of the region last month , local reporters said . 
Fino arrived by helicopter in the rebel-held stronghold of Gjirokaster , 30 kms ( 20 miles ) from the Greek border and was welcomed by rebels bristling with weapons , the reporters said . 
he was greeted by rebel leaders and their bodyguards from Gjirokaster and Tepelene , another stronghold to the north . 
he shook hands with Gjoleke Malaj , the rebel boss in Tepelene . 
Fino told reporters he was in the region to meet &quot; legal representatives of local power and public order &quot; and he barred the rebels from closed-door talks with elected officials . 
legally elected officials have remained in the region but the south has been controlled by rebel-run Committees of Public Salvation since the army was driven out and munitions depots looted in early March . 
the meeting with elected officials lasted 10 minutes and then moved to a hall where Fino , elected officials , rebel leaders and the Salvation committees all joined in discussions , the reporters said . 
Albania has been swept by violence since January when a number of fraudulent investment schemes collapsed , wiping out millions of dollars in savings . 
the anti-government riots and protests evolved into a full- scale uprising against President Sali Berisha , who is blamed for letting the &quot; pyramid &quot; schemes flourish . 
rebels seized towns and villages throughout the south , and now control about half of the country .
