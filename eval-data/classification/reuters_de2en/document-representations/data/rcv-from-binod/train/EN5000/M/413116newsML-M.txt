Delhi shares ended sharply higher on Saturday , as investors went on a buying spree after a market-friendly federal budget , traders said . 
they said the Delhi bourse &apos;s benchmark stocks index climbed 31.87 points -- nearly four percent -- to close at 811.83 points , as funds and speculators bid after taxes were slashed in the 1997 / 98 ( April-March ) budget announced late on Friday . 
&quot; The market was flooded with buyers on expectations that the prevailing buoyancy is likely to be maintained for some more days before we see a correction in prices , &quot; said Suresh Aggarwal at brokers JAI Mata Securities . 
&quot; The index has shot up by more than 60 points in just two sessions , &quot; Aggarwal said . 
traders said foreign and domestic funds were aggressive bidders in leading blue chips after the budget announcments beat market expectations . 
market-friendly measures included the withdrawal of a tax on income from company dividends and a proposal allowing companies to buy back their own shares . 
finance Minister P. Chidambaram also hiked the investment limit in firms for foreign institutional investors ( FIIs ) and diluted the minimum alternate tax ( MAT ) . 
shares of reliance Industries gained 15.50 rupees to 310 .
