if 1996 has been a party year , with the AEX index of leading Dutch shares up more than 25 percent , 1997 will be a more sober affair , analysts say . 
the blue chip AEX index next year is seen still underpinned by solid fundamentals of low Dutch inflation , a steady growth economy and a dependable corporate earnings stream , but analysts are not banking on the sort of gains seen during 1996 . 
analysts forecasts for the AEX by the end of 1997 cluster around the 660 / 670 level , roughly 10 percent up from the current AEX level of 610 . 
&quot; I think few people would have foreseen the index going up as much as it did in the last year because everyone , including us has been surprised by the good developments in interest rates , &quot; said Jacob Bosscha of Bank Labouchere . 
the AEX ended the first trading day of 1996 with a record high close and carried on breaking record after record throughout the year as world interest rates eased , with the Dutch index peaking at an all-time high of 636.75 on December 3 . 
Amsterdam and many other world stock markets dropped sharply after U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan on December 6 warned about the potential damage to the economy caused by &quot; irrational exuberance &quot; in financial markets . 
many took that as a signal that the next move in U.S. interest rates would be up rather than down and trading throughout the world &apos;s stock markets was tinged with fear that the global bull market trend was about to unravel . 
but analysts say Dutch investors are not standing by the door looking to get out . 
they still see value in the market , a point they proved by buying back into Dutch shares after the initial 38 point or six percent drop on Greenspan &apos;s remarks . 
&quot; I don &apos;t really expect a crash because of what we &apos;ve seen in the last couple of weeks , &quot; said Dennis Ederzeel of Delta Lloyd . 
&quot; On some days the market dropped two percent but people started buying at those moments , so there is still a lot of interest . 
many analysts were factoring in some sort of correction next year as investors consolidate on the rapid run-up seen in 1996 . 
&quot; We have a positive stance on equities for a couple of years . 
but we don &apos;t rule out a correction of maybe 10 to 15 percent or more in the short term , maybe some time next year , &quot; said MeesPierson strategist Kees de Vaan . 
chart analyst Royce Tostrams at ING Barings sees a retreat to 550-560 next year followed by a resumption of the underlying long term uptrend . 
&quot; Every trend-line drawn on present charts and every indicator shows rising patterns . 
another bullish year for stocks seems almost certain , &quot; he said in a recent note to clients , advising them to buy into dips in the AEX next year . 
&quot; The big question is what will interest rates do next year ? 
we are assuming that they will increase slightly . 
that does limit you in the outlook for the AEX as a whole , &quot; said Bosscha , adding , that cash-rich Dutch institutions would still be looking for value in the stock market . 
&quot; If , like the Dutch institutions , you have the money coming in you have to spend it on something . 
I still think that the trend is a very gradual increase in the percentage of capital to be invested in shares , &quot; he said . 
Ederzeel of Delta Lloyd also said he was looking for a comparatively sedate 10 percent climb in Dutch stocks next year but voiced some concern about the pace of economic growth . 
&quot; It &apos;s a 10 percent rise and it &apos;s primarily based on the earnings forecasts for next year . 
there &apos;s about a 10-11 percent rise in earnings expected for next year , &quot; he said . 
with the real economy developing well next year a niggling worry will be the fear of overheating , he said . 
&quot; At the moment I &apos;m a little afraid that the economy is growing a bit too fast . 
that &apos;s my only concern , &quot; he said . 
we &apos;ve had two good years after each other . 
I think that the valuation at the moment is just right . 
we take ( long term ) political and macroeconomic elements into consideration and that makes us conclude that the market PES are historically high but well valued , &quot; he said .
