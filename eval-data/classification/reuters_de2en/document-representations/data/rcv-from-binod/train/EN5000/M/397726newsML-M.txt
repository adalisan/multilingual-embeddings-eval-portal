Caracas stocks closed off in slow trade , dragged down by profit-taking in leading utility Electricidad de Caracas , traders said . 
&quot; The stock &apos;s risen well recently , pushing along the rest of the market , &quot; said Banesco broker Simon Brad . 
&quot; But today it fell , bringing down the rest , &quot; he added . 
the Bolsa &apos;s 19-share index closed off 0.86 percent at 6,639.16 points as 25 million shares traded worth three billion bolivars ( $ 6.4 million ) -- below the market &apos;s current $ 10 million average daily turnover . 
among traded stocks , 21 fell , 12 rose and nine closed flat , with telephone company CANTV among the gainers , rising 21 bolivars to end at 2091.00 . 
Electricidad shed 8.00 bolivars , finishing at 529.00 . 
&quot; It seems like the second half of Agenda Venezuela has stalled , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; There &apos;s not much good news -- electricity tariff adjustments have been delayed , there &apos;s the doctors &apos; strike , and on-going problems with Viasa . 
Sivensa stock also adjusted on a share dividend , ended at 161.40 bolivars after Friday &apos;s 326.00 close .
