Syria said on Friday it was looking forward to French President Jacques Chirac &apos;s visit to Damascus , part of a Middle East tour aimed at exerting European influence on the region &apos;s stalled peace process . 
&quot; Syria hopes the visit would contribute in increasing cooperation in all fields and help efforts aimed at achieving a just and comrehensive peace in the region , &quot; President Hafez al-Assad &apos;s spokesman Joubran Kourieh said . 
&quot; Syria welcomes a bigger and more active and effective French and European role in the Arab-Israeli peace talks , &quot; he told Reuters in an interview ahead of Chirac &apos;s visit . 
the French president will arrive in Damascus on Saturday at the start of a tour that includes Israel , Jordan , Palestinian self-ruled areas , Lebanon and Egypt . 
he will meet with Assad on Saturday . 
Syrian officials said that Damacus would express readiness to resume talks with Israel on the basis of the land-for-peace principle and talks with the previous Israeli government . 
Syria , which has held sporadic peace talks with Israel since 1991 , wants full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights , occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war . 
new Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is opposed to trading occupied Arab land for peace and no talks have been held since Netanyahu took office in June . 
French diplomats said Chirac , who would be accompanied by a team of businessmen , would discuss how to expand activities of French business companies in Syria despite debt problems with Damascus . 
economic sources said Paris was keen to find a way to allow Syria repay debts amounting to 1.3 billion French Francs ( $ 250 million ) by rescheduling the debts . 
they said that France wanted to defend its economic presence in the region against a tough competition by United States companies , especially in the oil sector . 
Syria &apos;s exports are mainly crude oil and petroleum by-products in addition to hard wheat while France &apos;s exports to Syria are mainly heavy machinery and automobiles .
