President Bill Clinton hopes his showdown with Iraq will highlight his foreign policy skills , but so far it has only pointed up his inability to put together world support as his predecessor , George Bush , did . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s dead , &quot; a defensive Clinton said on Wednesday when asked if the broad coalition that joined forces in the Gulf War had ceased to exist . 
&quot; This was an action that I thought we had to take . 
it was a measured , strong , appropriate action . 
although Republicans generally have been cautious in their reaction to the missile strikes on Iraq ordered by Clinton , House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich publicly raised questions on Wednesday about the failure to generate broad-based support for the unilateral U.S. military action . 
&quot; The contrast between Desert Storm and the current level of ( allied ) support is a concern , &quot; the Georgia Republican told reporters . 
echoing the words of Republican presidential challenger Bob Dole , he said Congress would fully support American troops but made it clear that backing for the president would not be automatic . 
in 1990 then President Bush used his powers of persuasion to put together a coalition that seemed impossible , uniting most of the Arab world with Israel and much of Europe and Asia to drive Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein &apos;s forces from Kuwait . 
Bush , whose career was steeped in diplomacy as well as politics , made personal appeals to world leaders to stand with the United States . 
he worked the telephone . 
Clinton , who four years ago ousted Bush in a campaign that made scant mention of foreign policy issues , comes from a different background . 
politics was his life as governor of Arkansas and has taken much of his attention in Washington . 
in the latest showdown with Iraq -- the most violent clash since the Gulf War -- Clinton too made personal telephone calls to world leaders . 
but so far only British Prime Minister John Major has embraced the U.S. actions with any public enthusiasm . 
the French have distanced themselves from the American strikes , and the Russians have been critical , as have the Chinese and many Arab leaders . 
in Brussels the European Union postponed issuing a joint statement on the U.S. attacks on Iraq , underlining the division in Europe over the American action . 
diplomats said Britain had pushed for a strong statement of support for the missile strikes but others , notably France , resisted . 
they are supposed to reflect the 15-nation bloc &apos;s common foreign and security policy . 
in a rare public sign of the rift the U.S. action has generated , the French went so far as to challenge Washington &apos;s freeze on a U.N. plan to permit the sale of oil by Baghdad . 
it called for new negotiations to ensure that a U.N. resolution allowing Iraq to use the proceeds of oil sales for food and medical supplies could come into force as soon as possible . 
much of the turmoil among U.S. allies stems from the fact that Clinton is in the midst of a re-election campaign that officials in many world capitals believe is driving the latest showdown . 
the military strikes have generated a positive reaction among most Americans , who during the Gulf War heard Bush describe the Iraqi leader in demonic terms . 
in general , when a foreign crisis surfaces , Americans rally around their president . 
Republicans know that . 
dole initially suggested that the &quot; weakness &quot; of Clinton &apos;s foreign policy led to the current clash , but now the Republican challenger talks respectfully of his love for America &apos;s men and women in uniform , a bond that goes back to his own service in the Second World War . 
politically risky questions are being left to Gingrich and others . 
&quot; We are supporting the American troops in the Middle East . 
we think it is important to be united in moments of international tension , &quot; Gingrich said . 
Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona , a prisoner of war in the Vietnam War , in which Clinton avoided service , said a resolution would be introduced in the Senate on the need to build an international coalition to stand behind actions against the Iraqi leader .
