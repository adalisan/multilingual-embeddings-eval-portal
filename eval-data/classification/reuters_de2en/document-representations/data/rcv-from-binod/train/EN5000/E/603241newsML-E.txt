Chinese vice premier Li Lanqing said on Wednesday the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) would be ineffective without China as a member . 
without China , I &apos;m afraid to say , that the World Trade Organisation cannot fully exert its influence , &quot; Li told Asian and Pacific businessmen in Manila . 
&quot; Without the mutual recognition of diversity and stress on flexibility and without adherence to the principle of equality ... the development of the Asia- Pacific and world economy will be unattainable , &quot; he added . 
Li said China , the fastest growing market in the world , was ready to join the world trade body , but would not commit to what was beyond its means . 
&quot; China being a developing country adheres to the principle that rights and obligations should be in balance , and cannot commit itself to what exceeds its capacity and ability , &quot; Li said . 
Li , however , said China would continue to pursue market-oriented reforms initiated by late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping . 
he said average tariff rates in the country have been scaled down to 23 percent from 35.9 percent and will be subject to further reductions by the year 2000 . 
&quot; This policy will not be changed and should not be changed ... China is capable of developing its economy in a sustained , speedy and healthy manner , &quot; he said . 
WTO director-general Renato Ruggiero said on Tuesday that China must present an ambitious programme to open up its markets in its negotiations to join the trade watchdog . 
China and its major trading partners will hold talks in Geneva this month on Beijing &apos;s bid to join the WTO .
