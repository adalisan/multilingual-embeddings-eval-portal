implied volatilities for U.S. Treasury bond options were generally steady to softer as the underlying market hovered in narrow ranges , dealers said . 
there was notable interest in buying out-of-the-money puts and selling calls , perhaps reflecting views that the market could be entering a consolidative phase after big gains this month and before next week &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee meeting and June employment report , they noted . 
the biggest trade in the Chicago Board of Trade bond pit was a 7,000-lot August 110-114 combo , in which one firm bought the 110 puts and sold the 114 calls , traders said . 
later , another firm was seen trading a similar package in Septembers , in a smaller size . 
&quot; The effect it has , besides getting them very short , is that it knocked down the call vols and raised the put vols , &quot; said a brokerage firm trader at CBOT . 
&quot; You &apos;re looking for a downside move and , because of that , you think that the skew is going to get a bit steeper too . 
with September futures narrowly circling 112 , the 110 puts and 114 calls are about equally out-of-the-money , with delta of around 20 . 
such a combo trade makes little change to the overall volatility position and time-decay exposure of a firm &apos;s book at the present bond price level but alters its gamma sensitivity to the downside . 
the book &apos;s gamma would increase as bond prices fell , giving bigger changes in delta and allowing the firm &apos;s delta-hedge futures trading to better capture price movements at lower levels . 
&quot; That &apos;s kind of big if they sell that many ( combos ) , &quot; the brokerage trader said . 
traders also noted some outright put buying , which reflected growing interest in downside protection . 
one firm was seen buying 2,000 contracts of August 111 puts . 
still , bond prices recouped early losses by late trade and subdued volatilities in general , helped by a fairly well received two-year T-note auction . 
the $ 15.5 billion auction produced a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.46 times and a high yield of 6.027 percent , at which 90 percent of bids were awarded . 
implied volatility for August T-bond futures options was a touch softer at 7.9 percent , while September was steady at 8.2 percent shortly before the close . 
implied volatilities for December and March Eurodollar futures options were off about 0.2 point each at around 9.5 and 11.6 percent respectively as futures stayed range-bound . 
one firm was said to have sold a total of about 10,000 lots of short-September 93.50 / 93.75 strangles . 
short September options expire in September 1997 but are priced off September 1998 futures , which closed unchanged at 93.65 . 
&quot; It &apos;s a pretty good sale if the Fed doesn &apos;t do anything ( at the July FOMC meeting ) , &quot; a brokerage trader said , citing break-even levels in futures of 93.27 and 93.98 after premium intake of about 23 basis points .
