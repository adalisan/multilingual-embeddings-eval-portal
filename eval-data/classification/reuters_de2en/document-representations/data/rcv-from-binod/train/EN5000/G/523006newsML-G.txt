Olympic bronze medallist Graeme Smith of Britain faced an unwanted wait on Sunday to learn his fate in the 1,500 metres freestyle on the last day of the world short-course swimming championships . 
the programme &apos;s longest event is contested on the strength of heat times , with no final , and Smith had to swim in the morning session because of a slow submitted time , with his main rivals not entering the action until the evening session . 
Smith won his heat on Sunday in 14 minutes 46.85 seconds , a time which would have given him the gold at the last world short-course championships in Rio de Janeiro in 1995 . 
he was not allowed to swim in the fastest seeded heat because his one race of the past year in a 25-metre pool was a relatively slow 15 : 27.47 at the British short-course championships last December . 
Smith was not permitted to submit the 15 : 02.48 with which he took the Olympic bronze in Atlanta last July because that was achieved in a 50-metre long-course pool and he had a short-course time on record . 
&quot; I was really disappointed that nobody in the ( British ) association said I needed to do a short-course time , &quot; said Smith , who had imagined his Olympic time would count . 
&quot; If someone beats me by a few tenths ( of a second ) tonight I &apos;ll be very disappointed .
