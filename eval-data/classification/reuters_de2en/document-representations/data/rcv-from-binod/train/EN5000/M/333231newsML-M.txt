the Bangladesh taka closed unchanged at 42.5250 / 5300 to the dollar in a quiet interbank session on Saturday , dealers said . 
&quot; The market was absolutely quiet . 
there was almost no transaction between taka and dollar , &quot; said one dealer with a foreign bank . 
dealers said the market was dull due to virtually no demand for the U.S. currency , of which there was an adequate supply . 
the weekend closure of international markets further strained demand , they said . 
call money rates finished at 6.0 to 7.0 percent against Thursday &apos;s 6.25-6.75 percent . 
Friday is the weekend in Moslem Bangladesh .
