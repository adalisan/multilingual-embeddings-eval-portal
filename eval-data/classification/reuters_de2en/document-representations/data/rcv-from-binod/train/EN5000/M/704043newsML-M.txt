British Petroleum sold a 550,000 barrel cargo of Cusiana crude oil to a U.S. refiner at 90 cents a barrel under September West Texas Intermediate / Cushing fob , trade sources said on Thursday . 
the price was five cents higher than the level at which Ecopetrol , Colombia &apos;s state oil company , sold two Cusiana cargoes to another U.S. refiner late on Wednesday . 
the Ecopetrol cargoes , originally scheduled to load Aug 4-8 and Aug 10-14 , are expected to be co-loaded onto an LR2 vessel . 
the U.S. refiner is likely to keep one cargo and resell the other , trade sources said . 
six remaining cargoes of Cusiana are still available for August loading , plus one cross-month cargo belonging to Ecopetrol . 
BP , Colombia &apos;s top equity producer , has the next cargo loading August 12-16 .
