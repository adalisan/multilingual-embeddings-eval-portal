Central Asia is showing signs of economic recovery after years of disastrous slumps , but the former Soviet region has been extremely slow in luring foreign money , a new United Nations economic survey said on Monday . 
the U.N. &apos; s Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) predicted in its annual survey that recovery would continue in Kyrgyzstan , where Gross Domestic Product grew six percent last year , and in Uzbekistan , which turned the corner with two percent growth . 
GDP growth in Kazakhstan was forecast to recover to two percent in 1997 from 1996 &apos;s 0.5 percent , while it was continuing a nosedive in the impoverished mountainous republic of Tajikistan , where it contracted by 17 percent last year . 
the ECE said economies of the Turkic-speaking region stretching from the Chinese border to the east to the Caspian Sea to the west were coming out from the cold only slowly . 
it estimated that 50 percent of GDP came from the private sector in Kyrgyzstan , some 40 percent in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan but only 20 percent in Turkmenistan and Tajikistan . 
foreign trade liberalisation too had some way to go , with the state handling most imports and exports in all of the republics except Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan . 
former communists have kept power in most of the Central Asian republics , where liberalisation of prices , the end of state subsidies from Moscow and galloping inflation have sent living standards crashing . 
Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , Kyrgyzstan , Turkmenistan and Tajikistan , all go-slow reformers , accounted for just one percent of overseas direct investment in the world &apos;s developing and transitional economies , the ECE said . 
the survey said the region continued to scare away foreign investors with its curbs on foreign investment , including restrictions on foreign banks and on repatriation of profits . 
Kazakhstan , which was reforming faster , was getting the lion &apos;s share with some $ 2.8 billion in overseas direct investment early in 1996 , it said . 
&quot; The gradualism which all five governments have embraced for the pace of transition measures can be seen as having partly served as a cover to delay the impact of market-oriented restructuring , &quot; the ECE said . 
the survey said per capita foreign direct investment flow in Kazakhstan , where more than 27,000 Kazakhs now work for foreign companies or joint ventures compared to some 6,400 in 1993 , rose slightly to $ 54 in 1996 from $ 50 in 1995 . 
this was more than five times the figure in Russia , which had $ 10 per capita foreign direct investment flow in 1996 . 
comparative 1996 figures for other Central Asian countries were not available , but in 1995 , per capita foreign direct investment flow was $ 41 in Kyrgyzstan , $ 57 in Turkmenistan , only $ 5 in Uzbekistan and just $ 2 in Tajikistan .
