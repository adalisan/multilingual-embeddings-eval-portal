testimony ended Tuesday in the rape trial of Army Staff Sgt. 
Delmar Simpson , clearing the way for final arguments in the case Wednesday . 
Simpson &apos;s lawyers rested their case , in which they sought to show that all his sexual encounters with female trainees were consensual , after defence witnesses testified two of his alleged victims had said their sexual encounters were unpleasant . 
army spec . 
Hannah Pitt , describing a conversation with one of the trainees Simpson is alleged to have raped , told the court : &quot; ( Rape ) wasn &apos;t actually said , but when she was talking to me about it , it wasn &apos;t a happy feeling . 
Pitt had previously told investigators the trainee and Simpson had had consensual sex . 
Simpson , 32 , is charged with 19 counts of rape involving six women , and with 35 other counts including indecent exposure , battery and maltreatment . 
he has pleaded innocent to those charges but has admitted 11 counts of improper sexual intercourse with trainees and five of propositioning . 
Simpson &apos;s lawyers have argued that all of Simpson &apos;s sexual encounters reflected an atmosphere of wanton sexual activity at the Army &apos;s Ordnance Centre and School , part of the Aberdeen proving Ground . 
after the defence rested , the prosecution concluded its case with the presentation of two rebuttal witnesses . 
a military jury is expected to begin deliberations on the Simpson case following closing arguments Wednesday and instructions to the six-Member military jury . 
Scott Alexander , who oversaw Simpson and other drill sergeants at the ordnance centre , testified Tuesday that he had no explanation for being unaware of sexual misconduct there . 
&quot; It &apos;s very disturbing to me that such events have occurred , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s beyond me why there was not any inkling whatsoever to any of the misconduct conditions . 
army Judge Col. Paul Johnston said , in a discussion with lawyers outside of the jurors &apos; presence , that official ordnance centre policy encouraging an open atmosphere for reporting sexual harassment apparently was ignored . 
&quot; The culture within the unit was that they didn &apos;t report &quot; ( violations ) , he said . 
also testifying Tuesday , Pvt. 
Donna Jackson said the trainee Pitt had testified about had sex with Simpson more than once . 
but she also acknowledged , under cross-examination from prosecutor Capt. 
Theresa Gallagher , that the woman tried to warn others about drill sergeants at the facility . 
&quot; She was also warning you about the drill sergeants , that they did cruddy things to people ? 
&quot; Gallagher said . 
&quot; Yes , ma &apos;am , &quot; Jackson said . 
referring to a conversation with the woman regarding an encounter with Simpson , Jackson said , &quot; She didn &apos;t say &apos; rape &apos; to me when I spoke to her that night , but she was angry towards him ( Simpson ) . 
E-4 Tamila Carrington , who acknowledged having sex with Simpson , testified that an alleged rape victim was laughing about her sexual experience with Simpson . 
Carrington said she reunited with her Aberdeen friend a year later . 
Carrington said she believed that if her friend was raped , she would have told her . 
Simpson is the first of 12 trainers at the proving ground charged with sexual misconduct to go to trial , although four other cases have been resolved through plea agreements or administrative means .
