bonds were gaining slightly in line with the the firmer international trend with the spread between the benchmark 10-year cash and the Bunds consolidating around 90 basis points . 
but the greatest potential for gains was seen at the shorter end where investors were likely to be encouraged by expectations of a rate cut soon -- possibly on Friday -- by the Bank of Portugal and the firm escudo . 
the spread with the 10-year Bund stood at 89 basis points , unchanged on Tuesday &apos;s close . 
&quot; A cut of 25 basis points by the Bank of Portugal is not totally discounted in prices at the short end . 
therefore , gains are almost certain , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; The spread between the two and the 10 years has to rise above 100 and perhaps even reach 110 basis points , &quot; said one trader . 
the escudo was steady at 100.32 / 34 to the mark against its 100.31 / 34 opening .
