copper and aluminium prices pushed higher on Wednesday on bouts of shortcovering and ended near the day &apos;s highs , dealers said . 
Three-months copper finished the afternoon kerb at $ 2,163 , up $ 27 , after early short covering gains met little in the way of selling . 
&quot; The real resistance is at $ 2,175 / 80 . 
nearby spreads are still tight and there may some more short covering to be seen in the market , &quot; a dealer said . 
the market &apos;s attention was focused on tight nearby dates ahead of the &quot; third Wednesday &quot; pricing next week . 
cash to December backwardation was around $ 50 , cash for a day went out at $ 17 / $ 18 , while cash to threes ended at $ 145 . 
news the Dutch Bureau of Statistics admitted supplying flawed data on copper flows through Rotterdam , which cleared up the puzzle of substantial hidden stocks , was a background factor . 
aluminium also ended firmer , up $ 23.50 at $ 1,527 , after a bout of shortcovering pushed up values in the afternoon . 
&quot; There was some shortcovering following the refusal of the market to break below $ 1,500 over the last few days , and it ran into some stops above $ 1,520 this afternoon , &quot; a dealer said . 
aluminium was also attracting increased business ahead of the third Wednesday , analysts said . 
&quot; There &apos;s been some forward buying and since the market is still short it has the potential for a short covering rally , &quot; said William Adams of Rudolf Wolff .
