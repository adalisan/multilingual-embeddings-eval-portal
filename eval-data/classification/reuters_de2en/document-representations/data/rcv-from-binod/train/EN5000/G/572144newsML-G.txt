American women can be their own toughest critics , according to a survey released on Friday that found most felt motherhood was easier a generation ago -- and that their own mothers did it better . 
the main problem is trying to balance work outside the home with raising a family , the Pew Research Center for The People and The Press reported , referring to a survey of 1,101 U.S. women released two days before Mother &apos;s Day . 
&quot; fully half of American women with children under 18 now work full time , and the biggest challenge they face , in their own words , is dealing with time pressures attendant to being a mother as well as a worker and a wife , &quot; the survey said . 
&quot; No wonder American women believe overwhelmingly that the job of raising children these days is harder than it was a generation ago . 
seventy-one percent of women under age 30 said motherhood was tougher now than 20 or 30 years ago , and that escalated to 86 percent among women over 50 . 
more than half of all women surveyed -- 56 percent -- felt today &apos;s mothers were doing a worse job than their mothers did ; only 11 percent said mothers now do a better job . 
among mothers , only 35 percent said they were very satisfied with their performance as parents . 
only 17 percent of those surveyed thought the increase in women working outside the home was good for society , and 41 percent thought it was bad . 
the rest felt it made no difference . 
asked to rate how happy they were with life , single mothers of children under 18 ranked lowest , with only 33 percent saying they were very satisfied . 
unmarried , childless women under 40 came next , with 34 percent , followed by unmarried women over 40 with 38 percent . 
by contrast , 59 percent of married women with grown children said they were very satisfied . 
only half of married , working mothers with children under 18 could say that . 
overall , 48 percent of those surveyed said they were very satisfied with their lives . 
women generally took a dim view of societal changes that affect the family , with 65 percent saying single motherhood is bad for society , 62 percent feeling negatively about unmarried couples having children and 56 percent disapproving of gay and lesbian couples raising children . 
in the political arena , another survey found that one in four Americans believes a woman will be president in the next two election cycles , and 78 percent believe women will play a larger role in politics 10 years from now . 
that survey of 1,000 Americans was sponsored by the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University . 
in another development aimed at riding the Mother &apos;s Day wave , the Women &apos;s Legal Defense Fund urged an expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act to cover mid-sized businesses . 
the act , aimed at easing care for newborns and infirm relatives , offers 12 weeks of unpaid leave for employees at companies with 50 or more employees . 
the fund said 13 million more workers would be covered if the act included companies with 25 or more employees . 
&quot; Too many people are still forced to make an impossible choice between job and family when a crisis strikes , &quot; fund president Judith Lichtman said in a statement . 
&quot; Congress should quickly expand the FMLA to help more American balance their work and family responsibilities . 
at least six measures to expand the act have been proposed in Congress .
