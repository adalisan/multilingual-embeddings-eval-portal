December &apos;s U.S. trade data is expected to end a two-month string of narrowing deficits , though it was still too soon for the dollar &apos;s 1996 advance to have played much of a role , economists said . 
&quot; It &apos;s way too early to be looking for those effects to show through , &quot; said Dana Johnson , managing director of research at First Chicago Capital Markets Inc . &quot; It &apos;s more a sense it ( was ) already deteriorating for other reasons . 
the trade deficit in goods and services is expected to have fattened to $ 9.9 billion in December , according to a Reuters poll of Wall Street forecasters . 
the number , due on Wednesday at 0830 est / 1330 GMT , trails a smallish $ 8.4 billion gap in November and a more surprisingly tiny $ 8.01 billion imbalance in October . 
Johnson cited sluggish overseas growth as one reason for faltering demand for U.S. exports . 
but , other economists expect the unadjusted bilateral numbers with some major U.S. trade partners to show more improvement in December , before the strong dollar cuts into the U.S. trade position later in 1997 . 
Jonathon Basile , economist at HSBC Markets Inc , forecasts the bilateral deficit with Japan narrowed to $ 3.9 billion in December , from $ 4.3 billion the previous month . 
the gap with China should have fallen about $ 700 million to $ 2.3 billion . 
with West Europe he expects it shrank to about $ 700 million . 
&quot; The rise we &apos;ve seen in the dollar , especially against the yen and now the mark , points to wider trade gaps with those countries in particular over the next year , &quot; Basile said . 
however , he added : &quot; It does work with a lag , when you see this kind of move in the dollar . 
the dollar rose more than eight percent against the mark and almost 12 percent versus the yen last year . 
it surged about another 10.5 percent and eight percent respectively so far in 1997 , but economists often say measurable changes in trade performance can lag exchange rate moves by 18 months or more . 
economists expect the wider gap in December resulted from both a fall in exports and a jump in imports to the U.S. 
Carey Leahey , senior economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc , projects a 1.25 percent drop in exports from November &apos;s unadjusted $ 71.97 billion . 
he looks for imports to have risen 0.8 percent from the previous $ 80.37 billion . 
on the import side of the equation , the U.S. will continue to draw in more automotive parts , as domestic manufacturers continue to play catch up after the disruptive Canadian auto- workers strike in October , economists said . 
Basile expects the deficit with Canada widened by about $ 400 million in December . 
also , imports of computer-related products and industrial supplies such as crude oil , the price of which was still high in December before easing early this year , are expected to have had a negative impact on the deficit . 
exports of civilian aircraft and telecommunications products should fall . 
car exports are also expected to be lower despite the increase in imported auto parts . 
on the whole , the wider trade December gap should bring the overall fourth quarter deficit back on track with deficits earlier in the year , which were trending considerably larger than indicated in October and November , economists said . 
&quot; The last couple of months look to be a little better than trend and all we &apos;re really thinking about is reversion to trend here , &quot; said Johnson . 
however , if the U.S. import / export tally continues to outperform expectations , U.S. credit markets may start to back-pedal on recent forecasts of an economic slowdown , Leahey said .
