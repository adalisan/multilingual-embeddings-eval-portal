Ethiopia charged 5,198 former officials of the deposed Dergue military junta on Thursday including more than 2,000 in detention -- some held without any charge for nearly six years . 
special prosecutors said some were charged with genocide and war crimes and others with aggravated homicide and wilful injury . 
their trials are expected to last up to three years . 
those charged included former Marxist dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam , in exile in Zimbabwe , and 71 other officials already on trial in Addis Ababa since December 1994 , officials said . 
also charged was former marathon runner Mamo Wolde , 65 , who won Olympic gold medals in Mexico City in 1968 and Munich in 1972 and has been held in Alem Bekagne ( The End of the World ) , the special section at Addis Ababa &apos;s central prison . 
the charges against him were not made public on Thursday . 
but the chief prosecutor said last year he could prove that Mamo was the head of the revolutionary guard in the capital &apos;s Area 16 during and after the &quot; Red Terror &quot; of the 1970s when the Dergue killed those suspected of political opposition to it . 
Mamo says he is innocent and a penniless former athletic hero . 
all those charged are accused of being former officials of the Dergue Marxist military junta which seized power in 1974 and ruled until Mengistu was overthrown by guerrillas in May 1991 . 
the long delay in charging the suspects has alarmed human rights groups and foreign donors . 
chief Special Prosecutor Girma Wakjira told reporters the delay was because the problem was so complex . 
&quot; collecting , compiling and consolidating evidence on the one hand and deciding the law applicable for the trials on the other hand were major directions to be pursued , &quot; Girma said . 
charges included killing , torturing and causing the disappearance of 14,209 victims . 
prosecutors said defendants were split into categories including field commanders and crime perpetrators . 
they are charged under the Ethiopian Penal Code of 1957 and face the death penalty or life imprisonment if found guilty . 
Girma said 2,246 of those charged were in prison while 2,952 were charged in absentia . 
another 120 prisoners held for lesser but related offences had been released on bail throughout Ethiopia , Girma added . 
he accused the defendants of &quot; systematic human rights violations &quot; in chains of repression involving thousands of people down to the smallest village in the remotest part of the country . 
&quot; There were no magical or ready-made solutions , &quot; he added . 
&quot; The only solution was to remand detainees in custody according to the criminal procedure code of Ethiopia and to continue working hard to charge or release the detainees . 
the defendants will be tried throughout the country . 
summonses were expected to be issued for those charged in absentia . 
Girma said he planned to start extradition proceedings against anyone who then failed to appear in court . 
he gave no date for the start of the first new trial , saying it was up to the courts . 
the prosecution said it would present some 3,000 witnesses and large amounts of documentary and audiovisual film and tape evidence as well as forensic and other experts to prove its cases .
