U.S. December Standard and Poor &apos;s 500 futures closed lower for a second consecutive session , mired in profit-taking from recent gains and nervousness near record levels . 
at midday , December dropped through the psychologically key 700.00 , and sell programs and sell stops exacerbated the declines . 
traders said December &apos;s inability to hold early gains and failure to follow through on bounces to the middle of the day &apos;s range kept buyers wary . 
December closed down 4.25 points to 700.50 in a range from 698.70 to 707.20 . 
support at Friday &apos;s low of 697.35 held . 
&quot; It was pretty much profit-taking and a lack of follow through when we came up early , &quot; an S &amp; P 500 futures trader said . 
he cited good buying from several firms around the 700.00 level that stemmed losses . 
late weakness in December Treasury bond futures added to the heavy stock indices tone , traders said . 
in afternoon trade , debt traders focused on comments from Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence Lindsey , who told a community development lending conference that curbing inflation may mean a temporary rise in future rates . 
futures traders said a late rebound in December Nasdaq 100 futures kept a floor under December S &amp; Ps late . 
traders early in the session blamed some jitters on rumors , later denied , that Russian President Boris Yeltsin had died . 
others said nervousness stemmed from ideas the market had come too far , too fast . 
&quot; A lot of guys certainly have some trepidation about piling on to the market here . 
several traders noted one Wall Street firm selling S &amp; Ps and buying T-bond futures . 
trading overall was moderate , but heavy at times during the session , traders said .
