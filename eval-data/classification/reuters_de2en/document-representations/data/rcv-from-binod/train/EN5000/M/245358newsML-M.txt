new York precious metals futures ended higher on low volumes Tuesday , as the complex continued to consolidate following last month &apos;s slide to three year lows for gold prices . 
&quot; investor aversion toward purchasing precious metals continues to be the dominant theme as international equity and debt markets post robust returns , &quot; CPM Group managing director Jeffrey Christian said . 
&quot; Investors have not been heavy buyers of gold over the past two years , &quot; he said . 
&quot; In fact net investment demand for physical gold has been at its lowest level since the 1970s . 
COMEX February gold closed up 80 cents at $ 370.50 an ounce , after trading in a $ 371.30-369.40 range . 
total estimate gold futures volume was 16,000 lots . 
spot gold in the bullion market ended quoted $ 368.40 / 80 , compared to the London Tuesday afternoon fix at $ 368.25 , and the New York close Monday at $ 367.90 / 368.30 . 
total silver futures estimated volume was 9,000 lots . 
&quot; In the gold market , investment demand exerts a strong influence on price movements , second only to the impact of jewelry sector demand , &quot; CPM Group said . 
&quot; Looking ahead to what may bring investors back to gold , perhaps the most critical factor may be gold &apos;s role as a portfolio diversifier , although currency market concerns also could lead some investors toward gold over the next year or so , &quot; Christian said . 
&quot; The outlook for U.S. equity values is not bad at present and few investors want to forego participation in the greatest stock market advance in history , until there are signs it is ending . 
&quot; The key sign to watch for will be a decrease in corporate earnings projections . 
meanwhile , funds remain heavily net short in gold futures , but with commercial players already beginning to wind down activity for the year , a year-end short covering rally could provide some interest in the next few weeks , traders said . 
open interest in February gold futures stood at 92,517 lots Monday , with total COMEX gold futures open interest at 184,547 lots . 
while COMEX February gold remains in the downtrend it has been in for most of the year , the strength of the downtrend has begun to wane a little and momentum indicators are beginning to recover again from an oversold condition , analysts said . 
the standard 14-day ADX indicator , which attempts to measure the strength of a trend , has slipped to 26 percent in the past few days from 27 percent last week , while a standard nine-day RSI ( relative strength indicator ) recovered to 29 percent at the close Tuesday from a low of 16 percent on December 3 . 
the spot gold / silver ratio continued to slide though , ending at 76.11 Tuesday , from 77.12 Monday and down from a high of 80 on November 6 , reflecting the relative strength of silver . 
NYMEX January platinum closed up $ 1.50 an ounce at $ 371.70 , after seeing a new contract low Monday . 
the April gold / April platinum spread ended slightly firmer around 90 cents an ounce , after falling sharply Monday to close at just 30 cents an ounce from $ 2.00 Friday . 
the spread saw a recent high at $ 9.40 an ounce on November 21 .
