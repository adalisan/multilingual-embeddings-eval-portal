crude oil in the Mediterranean and West African markets continued oversupplied and under downward pressure , traders said . 
although few Urals cargoes were seen offered , a deal on Tuesday heard below dated Brent - $ 1.10 a barrel reflected the oversupply . 
&quot; And we should see a few small cargoes emerging before the end of the month , &quot; one refiner said . 
one Kirkuk contract holder said the Iraqis were still offering spot barrels but buying interest was subdued . 
&quot; They are offering barrels on the spot market for markets other than the Med , &quot; he said . 
negotiations continued between Syrian state oil company Sytrol and term contract holders . 
prices were wide apart with Sytrol around dated Brent -40 / 45 cents and some buyers holding off around dated Brent -80 cents . 
with such a large discrepancy in price ideas some customers expected the first March barrels to be lifted on the basis of an official selling price to be agreed later . 
&quot; Then maybe lifters for the second half of the month can threaten not to take their second half ( of the month ) barrels , &quot; one regular customer said . 
West African grades were all plentiful and with little buying interest emerging from the U.S. to support prices , most traders expected differentials to fall further . 
the next Forcados cargo offered was to load March 9-11 and thought destined for the U.S. 
this was followed by an unsold March 12-14 loader , a 14-15 and a 16-17 loader . 
in total at least eight cargoes remained unsold in March . 
by the 26th of January all February barrels had been sold , traders said . 
Forcados was assessed around dated Brent + 45 cents though traders said they would not be surprised if the next deal was actually lower . 
&quot; This market is a dog , &quot; one seller said . 
although some Nigerian equity holders were looking at contingency plans should the threatened DPR oil workers strike go ahead on Friday , most felt the Nigerian government would ensure any disruptions were minimal . 
&quot; I can &apos;t see them allowing major disruptions to occur with their main revenue earner ( crude ) , &quot; one trader said . 
another added that nobody expected loadings to be disrupted and did not see a problem in bills of lading being signed but that further paperwork might take longer to come through . 
&quot; So you might get the documents 40 days after loading rather than 30 days , &quot; he said .
