the ( U.S. ) Air Force may reverse its decision to exonerate the general who was in charge of the housing complex in Saudi Arabia where 19 American airmen were killed by a truck bomb , the New York Times said on Tuesday . 
the Air Force absolved Brig. 
Gen. Terryl Schwalier of blame in the June 25 blast after deciding that protective measures around the complex in Dhahran were adequate . 
but Tuesday &apos;s report said Deputy Defence Secretary John White called the Air Force &apos;s justification &quot; not sufficient &quot; in a confidential memo sent to top Air Force leaders last month . 
the paper said the memo ordered the Air Force to review the evidence and decide if someone should be punished . 
the paper said Congress members are also pressuring the Air Force to reconsider its December decision to exonerate Schwalier . 
&quot; Schwalier took some steps , but it seems to me that he didn &apos;t go far enough , &quot; Sen. Richard Shelby told the paper in an interview . 
White and senior aides to Defence Secretary William Cohen say they only want the Air Force to support its case better and say they are not searching for a scapegoat , the paper reported .
