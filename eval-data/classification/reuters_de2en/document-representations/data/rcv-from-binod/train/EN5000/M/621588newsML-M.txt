Danish bond prices slipped undramatically on Wednesday ahead of U.S. data , hit by market rumours of unofficial opinion polls pointing to a left-wing victory in Sunday &apos;s second round of the French general election . 
&quot; We expect the downward trickle to continue until the afternoon &apos;s U.S. data starts coming in , with the main focus on the April durable goods figures , &quot; one dealer said . 
the benchmark eight percent state bond due 2006 was down 0.27 point from the start at 110.25 , yielding 6.43 percent in 1.9 billion crown turnover , while the forthcoming seven percent 2007 benchmark fell 0.19 point to 102.77 , yielding 6.61 percent . 
the 2007 &apos;s turnover was only 500 million crowns , while the 2006 June future rose 0.18 point to 110.28 with 10 contracts traded . 
the six percent mortgage bond due 2026 gained 0.13 point to 88.83 . 
the crown traded at a virtually unchanged 3.8087 per mark at 1150 GMT . 
the 2006 &apos;s 10-year yield gap with Germany was unchanged at 48 basis points from the start , with the 2007-bund gap also unmoved at 66 bps .
