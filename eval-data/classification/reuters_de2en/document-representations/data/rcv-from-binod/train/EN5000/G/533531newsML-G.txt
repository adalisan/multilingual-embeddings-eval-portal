Nick Pullen sits locked in the Lotus position , face raised to the ceiling , eyelids flickering . 
suddenly he starts to bounce and , rotating his arms , propels himself energetically along two mattresses . 
according to the Natural Law Party this is yogic flying and it is the answer to all the world &apos;s problems . 
&quot; But he &apos;s only hopping , &quot; say sceptical journalists gathered for the campaign launch of two Natural Law Party candidates ahead of Britain &apos;s May 1 election . 
&quot; Well , we haven &apos;t actually achieved the flying stage , &quot; concedes Hugh Kelly , candidate for Milton Keynes South West . 
ancient Vedic law states there are three stages to yogic flying . 
by the third stage practitioners are able to fly at will but contemporary devotees haven &apos;t been able to get past the first , hopping stage because of all the &quot; collective stress &quot; in society , Kelly explains . 
at Britain &apos;s last national election in 1992 , when the party was founded , it won 0.4 percent of the vote . 
it now claims to have branches in 50 countries and to have won seats in Italy , the Netherlands , Croatia , Serbia and Germany . 
with 7,000 yogic flyers at work , a ruling Natural Law Party would be able to cut taxes -- eliminating Value Added Tax and reducing income tax -- because of the fall in spending on health , defence and policing , says Kelly . 
despite being confined to hopping , the Party claims its yogic flyers have already brought benefits to Britain . 
a group of 200 practitioners on Merseyside , northwest England , have produced a 15 percent cut in the region &apos;s crime rate since 1988 , the party maintains . 
Merseyside police are doubtful . 
&quot; But we welcome anything that brings a reduction in crime , &quot; says a spokeswoman . 
only half a dozen journalists turned up for the launch conference in a large , hotel function room in the centre of Milton Keynes , some 40 miles ( 65 km ) north of London . 
both candidates wear pale grey suits , a little too summery for the chill day , with striped shirts and sober ties . 
each takes his turn to say his piece , while the other gazes meditatively into space . 
Kelly , with his broad shoulders and broader smile . 
dwarfs his partner , Martin Simson , and he has an evangelist &apos;s fervour . 
&quot; We &apos;re bringing the light of science into politics , &quot; he beams . 
Simson , a balding , 35-year-old concentrates on the societal ills that are preventing the party &apos;s yogic flyers from getting off the ground . 
&quot; At the moment , governments are a puppet of collective stress in society , &quot; he says . 
Yogic flying -- or indeed hopping -- reduces society &apos;s collective stress , bringing all kinds of beneficial results such as improving the nation &apos;s health and bringing down the crime rate , Kelly says . 
thankfully , not everybody has to take up the arduous task of flying to bring about this virtuous result . 
a group of just 800 yogic flyers would be enough to sort out all Britain &apos;s troubles , according to a precise mathematical formula worked out by the Natural Law Party &apos;s guru , Maharashi Mahesh Yogi -- the Indian mystic who converted the Beatles to transcendental meditation in the 1960s . 
the important thing is that they all fly together , twice daily , says Simson . 
&quot; Yogic fying creates bubbling bliss in the individual and society , &quot; he says . 
the obvious place to find huge numbers of yogic flyers is in the armed forces and this is one of the central planks of the Party &apos;s manifesto . 
under Natural Law Party rule , three percent of Britain &apos;s armed forces -- about 7,000 people -- would become a &quot; prevention wing &quot; practising transcendental meditation and yogic flying . 
&quot; This is an effective and scientifically-proven method of reducing negativity and conflict . 
the remainder of the armed forces would carry out their duties as before , while the prevention wing would eliminate conflict at its source by preventing the birth of an enemy , &quot; says the Natural Law Party . 
an army spokesman declined to speculate on how British soldiers might react to being told they were to become yogic flyers . 
&quot; try the Royal Air Force , they might be interested , &quot; he suggested . 
the party is also ready to address foreign policy matters -- the 15 nations of the European Union are not ready for economic union yet &quot; because they haven &apos;t got a harmonious collective consciousness &quot; . 
Simson and Kelly are standing for the two seats Milton Keynes , a town built in the 1960s and 70s to house some of London &apos;s overspill . 
the Natural Law Party &apos;s headquarters , a vast turreted mansion called Mentmore Towers -- a gift to the Maharishi &apos;s followers from former Beatle George Harrison -- is nearby . 
both Simson and Kelly live at Mentmore Towers , where they are part of a team of 20 yogic flyers bringing peace to the prosperous county of Buckinghamshire . 
so far , the fruits of their efforts are not much in evidence -- or are they ? 
the broad avenues of Milton Keynes are uncannily clean . 
Smartly-dressed office workers chat happily as they walk in pairs across the concrete plazas from one gleaming steel and glass building to another . 
even the plants in the ubiquitous flower beds seem unnaturally tidy and obediently green .
