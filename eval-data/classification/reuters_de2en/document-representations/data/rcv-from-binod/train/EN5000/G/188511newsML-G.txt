Boris Becker and Monica Seles have confirmed they will defend their singles titles at the Australian Open in January , tournament organisers said . 
&quot; We certainly look forward to welcoming back our defending champions , &quot; tournament director Paul McNamee said in a statement . 
Seles , a four-time Australian Open champion , crowned her comeback to tennis by winning at Melbourne Park this year , extending her unbeaten winning streak at the grand slam event to 28 matches . 
she was sidelined from tennis for 28 months after being stabbed at a tournament in 1993 . 
Becker revived his career in Melbourne last January by clinching his first grand slam title for five years and his sixth in total . 
&quot; Monica &apos;s victory last year , overcoming such adversity , is one of sport &apos;s greatest achievements , &quot; McNamee said . 
&quot; It &apos;s also great to see Boris &apos; entry , given the wrist injury problem he sustained at Wimbledon . 
clearly his recent victory in Stuttgart over world number one Pete Sampras shows he &apos;s back in good form and we look forward to his return . 
the Australian Open will be staged in Melbourne from January 13-26 .
