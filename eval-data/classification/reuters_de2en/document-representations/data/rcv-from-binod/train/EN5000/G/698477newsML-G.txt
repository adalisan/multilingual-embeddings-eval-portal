Ukraine &apos;s President Leonid Kuchma looked set to end speculation about the political fate of his controversial prime minister by accepting his resignation on Wednesday . 
an aide to Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko , 44 , who has been in hospital since June 19 , said he told close advisors on Tuesday that he had submitted his resignation . 
the local media , which has speculated widely about Lazarenko &apos;s links to the lucrative energy sector and a mounting campaign for his dismissal by Western and Ukrainian officials , immediately started considering possible replacements . 
&quot; The prime minister called a meeting with his close aides and he told us he had offered his resignation to the president . 
he was sure the president would accept it , &quot; the aide said . 
other aides had said it was just a ploy when Kuchma replaced Lazarenko with his deputy Vasyl Durdynets on June 19 &quot; for the time of his illness &quot; and subsequent events seemed to confirm that . 
the chief doctor at the elite government hospital at Feofaniya outside Kiev said at first that it was very likely that Lazarenko would have an operation for a severe form of varicose veins in the legs which could cause a heart attack or stroke . 
but the doctor said last week that Lazarenko , a solid , dark , bespectacled figure , might still have an operation and could not comment on his state , saying simply : &quot; His condition is the condition of someone who is undergoing medical tests . 
Lazarenko &apos;s top aide said he was suffering from exhaustion and Kuchma &apos;s spokesman said he &quot; unfortunately &quot; had no idea what kind of illness Lazarenko had . 
Lazarenko took over as prime minister in May 1996 from Yevhen Marchuk , who was accused of mishandling the economy and self-promotion . 
in turn , he was blamed in part for slow privatisation and failing to stamp out government corruption . 
Western media have said that Lazarenko was behind Ukraine &apos;s biggest gas trader , the United Energy Systems of Ukraine , and alleged that he received $ 200 million in revenues . 
he was the initiator and backer of a scheme introduced in 1995 which involved private companies distributing gas on the Ukrainian market . 
he denies any personal gain . 
Kuchma has slammed Lazarenko &apos;s goverment for failing to push through reforms and this year &apos;s budget , which did not receive parliament &apos;s approval until June 27 . 
Ukraine desperately needs to implement reforms to qualify for a multi-billion-dollar payment from the International Monetary Fund , which has said it may delay an interim stand-by deal until Ukraine meets the rest of a list of 41 conditions . 
Kuchma has the right to appoint an acting prime minister for 60 days but his choice would then need majority approval in parliament , which is due to break up in mid-July and reconvene in September . 
suggested potential replacements for Lazarenko included Anatoly Kinakh , head of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs , and Serhiy Tyhypko , deputy minister in charge of reforms , who has an image as a youthful reformer who could boost Ukraine &apos;s image abroad . 
analysts have also predicted that Olexander Tkachenko , a prominent leftist and first deputy speaker in the conservative-dominated parliament , could be in the running . 
Durdynets , the acting prime minister , is a former police general seen as loyal to Kuchma but lacking the support he would need in parliament to approve his appointment .
