Iberia &apos;s 10-year bonds may get a lift from any eventual rise in U.S. interest rates next week , providing it were only a quarter of a point , but the mood on monetary union will again determine how they perform against the Bunds , analysts said . 
they said that the market was already discounting the U.S. Federal Reserve would increase its discount rate by 25 basis points when its Open Market Committee meets on March 25 . 
a rise of 50 basis points , however , would be taken as a sign that the Fed saw greater cause for concern about inflation than markets had thought . 
if there are no negative declarations ( on monetary union ) and the Fed raises rates 25 basis points ... the spread of the ( Spanish ) Bonos ( against Bunds ) could narrow , &quot; said analyst Valentin Fernandez of Credit Lyonnais in Madrid . 
in this scenario , the spread between the 10-year Bono and its Bund equivalent could narrow below 120 basis points from around 125 at present , the analyst said . 
a Reuter survey of 48 European economists , showed 34 expecting the Fed to raise the federal funds rate , which currently stands at 5.25 percent , by at least 25 basis points . 
&quot; Twenty-five basis points are more than incorporated into prices , in the ( Portuguese bonds ) ot and the ( Spanish ) Bonos , and if this happens ( the Fed raises by 25 basis points ) , the market is going to buy , &quot; said Serge Goncalves of Finmat in London . 
&quot; If the Fed goes 50 basis points , this will hurt the &apos; core &apos; markets , like Germany , more than the peripheries , &quot; said analyst Nuno Godinho of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Lisbon . 
analysts said that if the Fed were to tighten 50 basis points , there was still good support for the Spanish and Portuguese 10-year bonds at yields of 7.30 and 7.00 percent , respectively , against their current 7.13 and 6.90 percent . 
Spanish Economy Minister Rodrigo Rato meets his French counterpart Jean Arthuis on Monday and markets will be watching closely for confirmation that they still see the single currency being launched in January 1999 and that Spain can be part of it . 
&quot; The meeting is important . 
the ot and the Bonos could gain support if the timetable for monetary union is reaffirmed , along with Spain &apos;s progress in convergence , &quot; said a trader at a London bank . 
but analysts saw more upside for Spain than Portugal because the ot was already trading with yields 25 basis points below those of Spain , which was seen as excessive and due largely to the lack of liquidity in the Portuguese market . 
&quot; With the Fed tightening ( monetary policy ) , the dollar consolidating gains and tension about peripheral currencies fading ... the Bonos are likely to draw more benefit than the ot , &quot; the London trader added . 
analysts said that the recent rise in yields at the short end , triggered by concerns over monetary union and the Fed , had probably been overdone , bearing in mind that there was still room for official rate cuts in both Spain and Portugal . 
&quot; Perhaps the Bank of Portugal will not cut rates this week . 
but that is the way ahead , clearly , &quot; said Finmat &apos;s Goncalves .
