a member of Italy &apos;s ruling centre-left alliance said on Wednesday it had worked out a joint parliamentary motion with the opposition centre-right Freedom Alliance over the deployment of a security force for Albania . 
&quot; We have reached an agreement with the parliamentary party leaders of the Freedom Alliance on an eight-line text , &quot; said Sergio Mattarella , chairman of the centrist Popular Party . 
the Chamber of Deputies ( lower house ) is expected to vote on the Italian-led mission at around 1800 GMT . 
the motion will carry the signatures of parties from both blocs . 
Prime Minister Romano Prodi , grappling with the worst crisis of his 11 months in office , earlier told the Chamber he would ask President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to decide his fate if key ally Communist Refoundation deserted him in the vote . 
the party has confirmed it intends to vote against the 6,000-strong force , the first such mission to be led by Italy , which has U.N.-approval and is due to start deploying next week . 
Scalfaro , the supreme arbiter in Italian politics , could in such an event either ask Prodi to tender his resignation or send him back to parliament for a confidence vote on the government .
