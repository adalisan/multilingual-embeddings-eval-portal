the Federal Reserve was widely expected to keep leading short-term interest rates unchanged when its policy-making council meets on Tuesday to map out the future course of U.S. monetary policy . 
with the economy humming along at a comfortable speed without experiencing any bumps in inflation , the central bank has little reason to raise rates now , analysts said . 
that rosy economic outlook helped Wall Street recover some of the heavy losses stock prices suffered last week . 
the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 108.70 points at 7,803.36 on Monday after losing more than 247 points on Friday amid growing worries over the future of U.S. corporate profits and a dip in the dollar &apos;s value . 
a group of 31 economists polled by Reuters unanimously said they expected the Fed to keep the key federal funds rate -- what banks charge each other for overnight loans -- unchanged at 5.50 percent . 
recent economic data strongly suggest growth is moderate and inflation is steady as the U.S. economy has entered the seventh year of economic growth -- the third-longest period of expansion since the end of World War Two . 
&quot; Raising short-term rates at this time would be tantamount to putting on a raincoat and walking around with an oversized umbrella on a perfectly sunny day , &quot; said Anthony Chan , chief economist at Banc One Investment advisors in Columbus , Ohio . 
the Fed last changed interest rates on March 25 , when it raised the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to pre-empt inflationary pressure . 
it stood by at its last two rate meetings in May and July , convinced that the U.S. economy would calm down by itself from its break-neck speed at the start of the year . 
from a torrid 4.9 percent pace in the first quarter of the year , economic growth slowed to a more sustainable 2.2 percent in the April-July quarter as consumers reined in spending and inventories began to build up . 
growth is expected to pick again in the third quarter , but analysts disagree on whether that would be sufficient to prompt the Fed to tighten credit again . 
some two-thirds of the economists polled by Reuters projected the Fed would raise borrowing costs at least once before the end of the year . 
analysts said raising the cost of credit now would choke off the expansion prematurely and risk sending already nervous markets into a tailspin . 
higher interest rates usually hurt stock markets by making bonds a relatively more attractive investment . 
&quot; I would be very surprised , even shocked , if the Fed did anything at this meeting , &quot; said Lyle Gramley , a former member of the central bank &apos;s Board of Governors .
