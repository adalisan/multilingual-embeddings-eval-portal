Malaysian tin price fell to a new 27-month low of 13.74 ringgit ( $ 5.46 ) a kg on Tuesday after a weaker London market sparked off selling , traders said . 
the metal dropped 12 cents from Monday &apos;s close . 
&quot; A lot of selling came into the KLTM from all sources after sellers saw the price fall in London yesterday , &quot; a trader said . 
the market saw an opening offer of 123 tonnes against bid of 59 tonnes . 
final turnover was 113 tonnes against 78 on Monday . 
&quot; buyers are scarce and prefer to adopt a wait-and-see attitude as the market is falling . 
they are hoping that the metal will fall further , the trader added . 
buyers were from Europe , Japan and Malaysia . 
the Malaysian price premium over the London market narrowed to $ 55 a tonne against $ 80 on Monday . 
fundamentally , the market was still sound and prices should rebound as the fall was just in line with a lower London close , traders said . 
&quot; We are optimistic that demand will come back because of the attractive prices . 
but it will depend on the performance of the London market tonight , &quot; another trader said . 
most traders were expecting the price to climb back to the psychological level of 14 ringgit .
