the Democratic Republic of the Congo appealed on Tuesday for urgent action to save its dwindling wildlife , but an environmental conference failed to agree any major initiatives because of the country &apos;s recent political upheaval . 
&quot; The situation is dramatic . 
we have to act , we have to act swiftly before it is too late , &quot; Environment Minister Eddie Angulu of the former Zaire told the one-day conference . 
&quot; At the Virunga national park ( in Eastern Congo ) , the population of hippopotamus has been reduced . 
it went down to 1,500 in 1996 from 30,000 in 1990 , &quot; Angulu told delegates from major international conservation organisations and donors . 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo has the largest share of the continent &apos;s tropical forest and vertebrates , but poaching and lack of effective environmental policies have brought a number of species to the brink of extinction . 
the Swiss-based World Wide Fund For Nature and the Howard Gilman Foundation of the United States took part in the Kinshasa conference . 
Claude Martin , director general for the World Wide Fund for Nature , told Reuters that many projects were held in abeyance in Africa &apos;s third-largest state because of political instability . 
former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko was ousted by rebel forces under Laurent Kabila in May , putting an end to Mobutu &apos;s 32-year rule and installing Kabila as head of state . 
Martin said some steps had to be taken to protect wildlife , but that they could only be short-term . 
&quot; The minister has cried for help . 
urgent measures have to be taken in the short term . 
initially we will spend about $ 3 million on an emergency programme with this country , &quot; he said without elaborating . 
&quot; The only population of northern white rhinoceros is in this country . 
it has to be protected . 
it has gone down to 30 , &quot; he said . 
over 1.5 million Rwandan refugees crossed the border into former Zaire in 1994 during the civil war in Rwanda , causing considerable damage to wildlife in Zaire as they felled trees and carelessly hunted animals . 
Mobutu &apos;s government said in 1995 that the &quot; ecological catastrophe &quot; was estimated at $ 2 billion . 
it appealed in vain for international assistance .
