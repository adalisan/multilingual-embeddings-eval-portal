a high-ranking German official urged NATO on Wednesday to respect Russia &apos;s security concerns by halting discussions about further eastern expansion after the first round of enlargement . 
Russia was still upset about NATO &apos;s initial decision to take in new members from Central and Eastern Europe and talks about a second wave of enlargement could create new tensions , visiting German junior foreign minister Helmut Schaefer told reporters . 
&quot; It is frightening the extent to which Russia feels hurt and wounded . 
I was not expecting such a strong reaction , &quot; Schaefer said after talks with Russian officials , artists , journalists and intellectuals . 
he said NATO should pause for reflection after the summit on July 8 and 9 in Madrid when the Alliance starts its first wave of expansion . 
&quot; After the first round we should think about a security system for the whole of Europe before more harm is done , &quot; Schaefer said . 
&quot; I warn all those in Germany who , out of jingoism , want to take all sorts of countries into the Alliance . 
Russia &apos;s former communist allies Poland , the Czech Republic and Hungary are expected to be admitted into Nato in the first round . 
Romania and Slovenia are also fighting for quick membership but face US resistance . 
Moscow is furious about Nato enlargement , saying the move would harm its security interestls for a new security plan which could involve the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 
&quot; What we need is an alternative concept , &quot; he said .
