Belgium coach Georges Leekens on Monday named Serbian-born Gordan Vidovic and recalled PSV Eindhoven striker Gilles De Bilde for the June 7 World Cup qualifier against San Marino . 
de Bilde had ruled himself out for Belgium &apos;s past two group seven qualifiers , against Wales and Turkey when he was banned until the end of March for punching an opponent in a league game in December . 
he moved to PSV from Anderlecht when serving the ban and helped his new team clinch the Dutch title on Sunday . 
Mouscron midfielder Vidovic obtained Belgian nationality last month . 
Leekens had wanted to call up Vidovic for the Turkey match last month but FIFA was unable to confirm in time that Vidovic had never played for Yugoslavia or Serbia . 
de Bilde &apos;s PSV team mate Luc Nilis , who also missed Belgium &apos;s two previous qualifiers , is sidelined again because of a nagging ankle problem .
