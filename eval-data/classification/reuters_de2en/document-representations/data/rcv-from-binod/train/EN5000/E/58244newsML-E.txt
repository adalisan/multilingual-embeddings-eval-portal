Mexican consumers continued to penny-pinch in the second quarter of the year , in the aftermath of the crushing 1995 recession , suggesting at present a half-cocked recovery , analysts said . 
in a review of supply and demand in second quarter gross domestic product ( GDP ) data released on Friday , inventory building and government investment projects carried the economy more than the Mexican shopper . 
&quot; You &apos;re not firing on all cylinders here . 
you &apos;ve still got a fairly fragile situation , &quot; said Denis Parisien , economist at I.D.E.A. 
in New York . 
&quot; Those people who are expecting a four to five percent growth rate next year may end up getting disappointed . 
a 7.2 percent rise in second quarter GDP announced last month triggered a wave of optimism that Mexico &apos;s economy was fully on the mend after the economic crisis the year before . 
but that bullishness has been tempered by data since , and analysts say stock prices have suffered as a result . 
in Friday &apos;s breakdown , Q2 private consumption rose 2.9 percent , a lower-than-expected increase that looks lackluster when compared with the depths of recession in the second quarter of last year , Parisien said . 
on the other hand , aggregate supply was up 10.5 percent during the period . 
&quot; Given that aggregate demand is up so little , you &apos;ve got a big increase in inventories , &quot; Parisien said . 
in the same data in the first quarter , economists had hailed a surprising rebound in consumer demand . 
that recovery was not borne out by retail sales figures in later months , however , that some economists argued remained sluggish . 
&quot; households and small businesses are still struggling to refinance their debts . 
there &apos;s no discretionary income to go out and spend , &quot; Parisien said . 
helping compensate in the second quarter , economists said , was a sharp increase in government investment spending , that rose 38.4 percent in Q2 compared with the same period a year before . 
private investment was up 13.9 percent . 
the government pumped money into infrastructure projects in the second quarter , in a bid to grease the wheels of the recovery and help boost employment . 
but its ability to stoke the economy long-term is considered volatile . 
&quot; taken as a whole ( including the 7.2 percent GDP rise ) , the numbers suggest that the recovery is as strong as we expected , but the underpinnings of demand are somewhat less certain than we expected , &quot; wrote Morgan Stanley economist Ernest Brown in a report on Monday . 
he said demand was &quot; based somewhat less on the consumer , and somewhat more on inventory accumulation and government investment spending , both more volatile sources of spending &quot; . 
in a cautionary note on the speed of recovery , he cited anecdotal evidence that government investment spending may have fallen sharply in the third quarter from second quarter levels . 
he also aired doubts about inventories . 
&quot; inventory rebuilding at high levels will have to be continually validated by accelerating consumer and investment spending in coming quarters if this source of demand is to continue . 
Brown , however , stuck by his forecast of estimated growth in 1997 of 4.0 percent . 
&quot; Mexico &apos;s recovery is doing just fine , but the patient isn &apos;t out of the woods yet , &quot; he wrote .
