suspected Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) rebels have killed three civilians in an attack in central Turkey , police said on Tuesday . 
assailants opened fire on two cars on a lonely road in the central province of Sivas on Monday night , killing two women and a two-year-old child , a police official said . 
&quot; According to the information we have it was most probably the PKK , &quot; he told Reuters by telephone from Sivas . 
the guerrillas killed a policeman and another person in an attack on an intercity bus in the same area last week . 
Sivas has only a small Kurdish population and is not one of the ten southeastern provinces under emergency rule where the rebels are most active . 
but rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan warned last week that his forces would stage attacks on the periphery of the mainly Kurdish southeast to stretch security forces . 
more than 3,000 people have been killed in 12 years of conflict between soldiers the rebels , fighting for autonomy or independence . 
the rebels damaged two government buildings in the town of Baskale , near the Iranian border , in a rocket attack on Monday night , Anatolian news agency said . 
no-one was injured .
