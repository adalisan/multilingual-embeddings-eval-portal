Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Thursday Israel had not abandoned its construction of a new settlement on occupied territory south of Jerusalem and that this was &quot; viewed as particularly serious . 
his comments were contained in a written report expected to be made public shortly . 
it was requested by an emergency special session of the General Assembly in April which demanded the immediate cessation of construction at the site , called Har Homa in Hebrew and Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic . 
the Assembly resolution , adopted by a vote of 134 to three with 11 abstentions , also demanded a halt to all other Israeli settlement activities and called for an end to all support for &quot; illegal Israeli activities &quot; in the occupied territories . 
&quot; According to the information available to the United Nations , the government of Israel , as of June 20 , 1997 , has not abandoned its construction of a new Israeli settlement at Jabal Abu Ghneim , &quot; Annan said . 
even before the report was issued , the Palestinian U.N. observer mission declared its intention of calling for the reconvening of the emergency Assembly session . 
Annan detailed exchanges which led him to conclude that conditions set by Israel made it impossible for him to send a special envoy to the area to help prepare his report . 
it was therefore based on &quot; reliable sources available to the United Nations at headquarters and in the field , &quot; he said . 
the report said settlement activity continued unabated throughout the occupied territories even during 1992-96 , a reference to the period prior to the election of Israel &apos;s right-wing government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . 
&quot; The Abu Ghneim incident is nevertheless viewed as particularly serious for a number of reasons , &quot; Annan added , citing political , geographic , demographic and economic factors , as well as effects on the peace process . 
politically , the start of building at Jabal Abu Ghneim on March 18 &quot; represents the first move to construct an entirely new settlement on occupied Palestinian lands since a freeze was imposed on such activities by the previous Israeli government in the context of the peace process . 
geographically it &quot; represents the final link in a chain of settlements constructed by Israel around occupied East Jerusalem , &quot; while demographically it would have a &quot; significant effect on further advancing the forced alternation of the religious and ethnic composition of occupied East Jerusalem . 
economically it was &quot; expected to have damaging effects on an already devastated Palestinian economy in the occupied territories . 
the report said Israel &apos;s refusal to abandon construction at Jabal Abu Ghneim &quot; appears to represent , in the view of the Palestinian people , the largest single negative factor in the breakdown of the peace process , and the fomenting of unrest in the occupied territories . 
&quot; Palestinian communities in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank , including Jerusalem , have responded with two months of public demonstrations and protest . 
Annan said Israeli settlement expansion activities also continued during this period in numerous locations throughout the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip . 
Israel was also widely reported to have issued plans for the creation of new settler housing units in the West Bank and Gaza Strip . 
&quot; External support for settlements and their economic infrastructures continued ... including through private support from foreign companies and individuals , &quot; the report said . 
&quot; There was also a marked increase in Palestinian violence against Israeli civilians , settlers and military personnel , &quot; the report said , mentioning several fatal incidents including the March 21 bombing of a Tel Aviv cafe .
