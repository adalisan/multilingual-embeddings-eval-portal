the Clinton administration settled or issued judgments in a record number of Superfund toxic waste cleanup cases in 1996 , Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday . 
&quot; Nineteen ninety-six was one of Superfund &apos;s best years ever ... generating $ 790 million worth of cleanup work at contaminated sites across the country , &quot; Reno said at a news conference . 
the Justice Department collected a record $ 384 million in payments from parties found responsible for dumping toxic waste that the government had to clean up . 
and it won commitments from private parties to conduct cleanups worth $ 406 million , according to a Superfund enforcement report released Thursday by the department . 
the report comes out at a time when the Clinton administration has been trying to prove to Congress that it has speeded up toxic waste cleanups by reaching more settlements with parties that dumped waste at Superfund sites . 
Republicans and the administration agree that the way to speed up cleanups is to stop the slew of lawsuits that responsible parties file against paying for cleanups . 
while Republicans are looking to prevent lawsuits simply by making the government pay for more cleanups , the Environmental Protection Agency has urged Congress instead to write into law the reforms it has made to settle more cases . 
assistant Attorney General Lois Schiffer said reforms such as exempting those who dumped tiny amounts of waste from paying cleanup costs and easing waste treatment standards based on future uses of the sites had led to more settlements . 
&quot; EPA is selecting remedies that companies find more palatable to undertake , &quot; Schiffer said at the news conference .
