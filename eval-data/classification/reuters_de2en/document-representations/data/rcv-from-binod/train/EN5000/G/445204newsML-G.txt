the most visited area of California &apos;s Yosemite National Park reopened on Friday , more than two months after violent winter storms and floods forced its closure . 
flooding in early January washed away roads and damaged cabins and campsites in the Yosemite Valley area , where most park lodges and campgrounds are located . 
while large portions of the huge park were reopened in the weeks that followed the floods , Yosemite Valley was closed until now as crews cleaned up debris . 
it was the longest closure in the park &apos;s 106-year history , officials said . 
&quot; A lot of people have worked hard to make this day possible , &quot; Yosemite National Park superintendent B.J. 
Griffin said at Friday &apos;s reopening ceremony . 
&quot; We &apos;re excited to welcome visitors back this afternoon . 
despite the cleanup , debris was strewn along the Merced river and crews were still stabilizing roads and buildings in the valley . 
fewer campsites were open and some hiking trails were literally washed away . 
&quot; We &apos;ve stabilized things . 
we &apos;ve patched things up , &quot; said Al Nash , a Yosemite spokesman . 
&quot; But two or three years of construction to recover is ahead . 
it &apos;s going to take a long time to settle things down . 
the cost of storm and flood repairs at the national park has been estimated at $ 178 million , but park officials said the cost could climb once the snow has melted and crews were able to get into areas inaccessible during the cold months . 
but some environmentalists said the floods would return the park to a more natural state and help to reduce human encroachment . 
&quot; It was a big cloud with a beautiful silver lining , &quot; said Barbara Boyle , an official with the Sierra Club environmental group . 
the 760,000-acre ( 307,000-hectare ) park , 150 miles ( 240 km ) southeast of San Francisco , is visited by over four million hikers , climbers and sightseers each year , drawn by its towering mountains , high waterfalls and scenic wilderness .
