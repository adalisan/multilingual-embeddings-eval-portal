Zimbabwe &apos;s government is trying to lure vital foreign investment by cutting short the time needed to approve projects and by opening up sectors currently reserved for local investors , a legal official said on Thursday . 
Bharat Patel , a legal adviser , told a business seminar that the Zimbabwe Investment Centre act would soon be amended as part of this drive , but gave no time frame . 
the current 60-day investment approval period would be cut to 28 days , he said . 
&quot; Another feature of the amendment is that where there is no notification , an investment will be deemed approved after 45 days , &quot; he added . 
the investment law would also be amended to allow new foreign investors to take minority shareholdings in reserved sectors such as food production , primary horticulture , wildlife ranching , livestock development , forestry , fishing and road transportation , with local investors having the controlling stake . 
the state-funded Zimbabwe Investment Centre was set up in 1994 and has managed to attract foreign investment worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the southern African state . 
but local economic analysts say Zimbabwe must improve its current incentives and also cut its bureaucratic procedures to attract more investors .
