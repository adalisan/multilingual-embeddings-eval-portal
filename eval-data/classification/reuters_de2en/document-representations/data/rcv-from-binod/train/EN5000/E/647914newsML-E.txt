voters in Georgia &apos;s peach County will go to the polls June 17 to decide whether a special-purpose sales tax should be levied to pay off school bonds approved in 1994 , the Macon Telegraph said . 
voters approved a 20-year general obligation bond issue in 1994 to fund seven school construction projects totalling $ 14.6 million . 
since then , property tax rates have increased by about 4.25 mills , an increase of about $ 170 a year on a $ 100,000 home , to pay debt service on the bonds . 
the new proposal would levy a one-cent special purpose sales tax for five years , raising about $ 2 million a year . 
if approved , the sales tax would replace the property tax millage .
