pop singer Madonna and other Hollywood stars were out in force on Saturday night for the long-awaited world premiere of &quot; Evita &quot; , a movie musical about Eva Peron &apos;s rise to power in Argentina . 
&quot; I feel like Cinderella , &quot; said a teary-eyed Madonna as she strode down the red carpet in front of thousands of screaming fans at the Shrine auditorium . 
&quot; Evita &quot; , which opens on Christmas Day , is a screen opera about the life of Eva Peron , the daughter of a poor farmer who became the wife of Argentina &apos;s President Juan Peron , played by Jonathan Pryce , and wielded power in her own right . 
Director Alan Parker and other cast members said the pop diva , who is no stranger to scandal , was perfectly cast to play Evita , who was considered a saint by the working class but was often maligned by members of the ruling class . 
&quot; She &apos;s extraordinarily professional and hard-working , &quot; director Alan Parker said of Madonna as he arrived at the festive premiere . 
&quot; She was always brilliantly prepared and very charismatic . 
it &apos;s very easy to work with her . 
Madonna , wearing a rose-coloured Givenchy dress with a nipped-in waist , was one of several celebrities who turned out for the event wearing outfits inspired by Eva Peron &apos;s era . 
it &apos;s the power woman look , &quot; said actress Tippi Hedren . 
while fashion designers are already betting that the holiday season &apos;s most-anticipated movie will draw floods of women to the stores in search of Evita-style clothes , many celebrities are also hoping that the film will breathe new life into the movie musical of yesteryear . 
&quot; Evita &quot; , which is woven around the songs of the popular Broadway musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice , includes no spoken dialogue . 
I loved all those Fred Astaire films , &quot; said actress Marisa Tomei who turned out for the premiere . 
Tony-award winning actress Glenn Close , currently starring in the popular &quot; 101 Dalmations &quot; , said , &quot; It &apos;s one of the great musicals . 
the music is just mind-boggling , very emotional , very beautiful and it &apos;s a wonderful coming together of the character and the musical , &quot; she said . 
the film &apos;s producers hope the star-studded cast , which also includes heart-throb Antonio Banderas as the film &apos;s cynical Everyman narrator , will be the recipe for a box-office smash . 
yet , with the unusual operatic format , distributor Walt Disney Co decided to take no chances and ran full-page advertisements announcing advance ticket sales for the epic musical as early as three months ago . 
indeed , the movie &apos;s premiere was considerably more hyped than most premieres in tinsel Town , according to several celebrities . 
&quot; This is a circus ! 
&quot; said Banderas , smiling and standing close to his wife , actress Melanie Griffith , before they entered the auditorium .
