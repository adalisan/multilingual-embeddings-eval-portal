survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing and the victims &apos; families celebrated the conviction of Timothy McVeigh on Monday , but many said even justice would not take their pain away . 
as a Denver jury found McVeigh guilty of blowing up the Alfred P. Murrah building on April 19 , 1995 , in an attack that killed 168 people , those hardest hit said justice had finally been served . 
&quot; It &apos;s just such a relief in my heart . 
I feel like a weight has been taken off of me , &quot; said Donna McKinney , who lost an aunt , a cousin and two close friends in the bombing . 
McKinney was among hundreds of people who gathered at the bombing site in downtown Oklahoma City to listen to the verdict , and she burst into tears of relief . 
&quot; We &apos;ve lost so many people , but at least he didn &apos;t get away with it . 
across town , bomb survivor Arlene Blanchard whooped with joy , jumped up and down and then sang &quot; amazing Grace &quot; to her five-month-old son with tears running down her face after hearing the verdict on her television set . 
&quot; Oh , thank you Jesus , &quot; Blanchard cried as the first guilty verdict was read out . 
she was in the army recruiting office of the Murrah building when the bomb exploded , and suffered back and neck injuries . 
at the bomb site , hundreds of people clapped and punched the air in victory when the verdicts came in , but Bud Welch , whose 23-year-old daughter Julie was killed in the bombing , said he could not celebrate even though he was convinced McVeigh was guilty . 
&quot; I thought it would be all joy but it isn &apos;t , &quot; Welch said . 
&quot; It &apos;s a very dull victory . 
the bottom line is that my little girl isn &apos;t coming back and I have the rest of my life to deal with that . 
most of the victims &apos; relatives want McVeigh to be given the death penalty at the end of the trial &apos;s sentencing phase , which starts on Wednesday . 
but many concede even that would not be enough to ease their pain . 
&quot; I supect that even if we get a death penalty , it is not going to make me feel any better . 
we &apos;ll have justice , but it is not going to change anything , &quot; said Sharon Medearis , whose husband Claude , a senior special agent of the U.S. Customs Service , was killed in the blast . 
nevertheless , survivors and relatives agreed that they were at least saved the misery of a hung jury or an acquittal , and all had words of praise for the jury and U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch . 
&quot; I am very proud of our Constitution , which has shown it can provide a trial that is appropriate even for McVeigh . 
we don &apos;t live in a vigilante society and this trial certainly represents a civilised nation seeking justice , &quot; bombing survivor Paul Heath said .
