DUNEDIN , March 12 - Sri Lankan cricket captain Arjuna Ranatunga did not have the look of a worried man when he returned to the scene of his country &apos;s latest sporting disaster , NZPA reports . 
a supreme diplomat , and as such well versed in masking his true feelings , Ranatunga played down his side &apos;s embarrassing defeat of an innings and 36 runs by New Zealand in the first cricket test in Dunedin . 
new Zealand outplayed Sri Lanka comprehensively to power to victory inside four days on Monday . 
while the kiwis enjoyed the spoils of victory -- namely a day of leisure and recreation -- the Sri Lankan players were back at the coalface yesterday conducting an open wicket practice session at Carisbrook . 
&quot; We have had lots and lots of bad games down the years . 
that was not the worst of them , &quot; said Ranatunga , who is now into his 16th season at international level . 
&quot; We didn &apos;t play to even 50 percent of our capabilities in Dunedin ; New Zealand played much the better cricket and as such deserved all the credit for their win , &quot; he told NZPA yesterday . 
&quot; It was very disappointing overall . 
we won the toss and did not capitalise on the pitch conditions and then our batting let us down . 
the tourists head to Hamilton today to prepare for the second test starting on Friday desperately short of time to repair the psychological damage inflicted by the New Zealand side here . 
their bowlers need plenty of work to rediscover their rhythm after being restricted to just two days of cricket on tour before the first test while their batsmen have to temper their natural flamboyance to preserve their wickets . 
&quot; We have a lot of homework to do before the second test to analyse our faults . 
we &apos;ll just have to get it right as soon as possible , &quot; Ranatunga said . 
new Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said the Sri Lankan batsmen always gave his bowlers a chance because of their natural inclination to attempt to find the boundary . 
&quot; You feel you always have a chance against them because they are dashers . 
that &apos;s where bowling dot balls against them is very important , &quot; Fleming said . 
&quot; dot balls are a form of attacking bowling against these guys . 
&quot; At the same time you do have to be careful that if they do get away that you have the bandages to heal the wounds . 
hopefully the cuts they make aren &apos;t deep enough . 
&quot; It &apos;s a matter of maintaining pressure . 
they are not happy with ones and twos , they &apos;re happy with boundaries . 
new Zealand are certain to go into the second test with changed bowling personnel . 
the need for a third seamer has been recognised by the selectors , who have brought experienced Wellington medium pacer Gavin Larsen into the squad and introduced Central Districts swing Bowler Andrew Penn for the first time . 
the New Zealanders are taking 13 players to Hamilton after it was confirmed yesterday that left arm opening Bowler Geoff Allott could not be considered due to a back injury and because of concerns about the fitness of Wellington speed merchant Heath Davis . 
the injury forced Allott to miss the test in Dunedin while Davis operated here under duress caused by knee and Achilles complaints . 
Fleming was proud of the way Davis bowled through the pain and spoke of the player &apos;s &quot; will to play &quot; for his team . 
&quot; Heath was carrying an injury but bowled out of his skin . 
he &apos;s bowling through his injuries . 
he &apos;s the type of guy who is so intent on doing well and performing to his best that he puts it ( pain ) behind him . 
new Zealand team physiotherapist Mark Plummer rates Davis &apos; chances of being fully fit by Friday at 80 percent . 
the home side &apos;s lack of resources on the bowling front at Carisbrook were self-inflicted after Allott &apos;s withdrawal and the decision not to draft in another seamer . 
Allrounder Chris Harris was instead rushed down from Christchurch to perform 12th man duties and has now been released for the second test . 
Simon Doull , who collected eight wickets in the game , and Davis had backup from part-timer medium pacers Matt Horne and Nathan Astle as well as spin specialists Daniel Vettori and Dipak Patel . 
the Trust Bank Park pitch in Hamilton has proven fertile ground for seam bowlers this summer , something national selection panel convener Ross dykes acknowledges . 
&quot; The Trust Bank Park pitch this year has given significant assistance to the bowlers and the selectors believe it wise to have all the necessary bowling options available to utilise whatever conditions apply on the morning of the match , &quot; he said .
