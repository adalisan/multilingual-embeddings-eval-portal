June notionnel futures traded on MATIF will look bearish on Friday while the gap up to Thursday &apos;s low remains unfilled , technical analysts said . 
&quot; On an hourly basis we have divergence between the bollinger bands and this divergence , coupled with the fact stochastics and MACD are not oversold , this means the market is bearish on a daily basis . 
&quot; said Phillipe Cahen , technical analyst at Credit Lyonnais in Paris . 
at 0824 GMT , June notionnel futures were at 128.20 , down 42 basis points on the day . 
the contract gapped down from Thursday &apos;s low at 128.56 to open at 128.26 . 
Bollinger bands are lines drawn at standard deviations around the price action to give support and resistance . 
Cahen said a close below 128.26 , would suggest the market should decline towards the lower bollinger band on daily charts which comes in at 127.16 . 
&quot; With the gap from the open still not filled , the market is bearish , &quot; he said . 
to the upside analysts said the top of the gap would act as resistance . 
&quot; If we close the gap and go higher than 128.62 ( Thursday &apos;s close ) , then we could move towards the previous high , although I think it is very unlikely , &quot; said Cahen . 
the high on Thursday was 128.94 , while above that level analysts said there was resistance at 129.38 , 
Simon Mattholie , senior proprietary trader at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London , said there was a slightly stronger case for buying France than for buying Germany . 
&quot; We have taken out crucial support this morning , but there is another level which is coming in at 128-04 , the low on April 14 , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It certainly looks as if the trend could be turning tail . 
he said for downside protection players would probably look down towards the 126.80 / 86 region . 
but Mattholie said he was cautious of the French market . 
&quot; If anything the technicals could make a strong argument that if the market begins to improve at low levels it could actually have bottomed , &quot; he said . 
if the notionnel manages to break through intital resistance from the top of the gap , he said it could rotate as high as the 128.78 to 128.80 region . 
&quot; But that would have to be a selling opportunity , &quot; he said . 
at the short end , June Pibor futures were at 96.30 , down four basis points on the day .
