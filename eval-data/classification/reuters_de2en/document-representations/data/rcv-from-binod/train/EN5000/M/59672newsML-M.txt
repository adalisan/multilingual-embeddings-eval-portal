--------------------- ( Sept 17 ) ------------------------------ 
* Long Australian bond yields made a steady decline throughout the day , spurred on by an aggressively bid T-bond tender , taking the 10-year bond back below 8.0 percent . 
* U.S. faces August industrial production and capacity usage . 
Long-dated Australian bond yields made a steady decline throughout the session , spurred on by an aggressively bid A $ 700 million Treasury bond tender , to close at their lowest level in three weeks . 
the benchmark November 2006 bond yield dived below 8.0 percent for the second successive session , but this time the move held once it became clear that the supply had been easily absorbed , traders said . 
&quot; The 2001 stock had been tight for sometime , and it &apos;s always nice to see a long bond ( 2008 ) go off well at a tender . 
it &apos;s looks as if someone took the whole lot , &quot; one trader said . 
the January 2001 stock went off at an average yield of 7.44 percent and the August 2008 at 8.04 percent . 
however , the market again finds itself dependent on the U.S. to maintain the current rally with no major data due for release until Wednesday &apos;s local merchandise imports for August . 
U.S. treasuries face August industrial production and capacity usage later today , which could provide another clue to the policy action that the FOMC might take on September 24 . 
recent inflation data seemed to suggest that the Fed will be on hold this time round , but the bond market continues to debate the issue , leaving it fairly flat after Friday &apos;s prices spike . 
the Australian / U.S. 
10-year bond yield spread reversed an early widening trend as the local market rebounded on the tender . 
the local yield curve also flattened amid switching to the long end to cover short positions placed prior to the bond sale . 
the December 10-year bond &apos;s bounce from an initial 91.930 and through Monday &apos;s 92.030 high sees the contract begin to fill a chart gap between 92.060 to 91.110 , inherited from the now expired September position .
