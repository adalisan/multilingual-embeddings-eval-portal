the Bulgarian Lev closed at about 1,568-1,573 per dollar , flat on the morning &apos;s 1,567-1,573 after a calm and rangebound interbank trade as demand for levs for wage and tax payments was high , dealers said . 
&quot; The Lev was supported by foreign currency sales from banks and clients , which have to meet wage and tax payments due by the end of the month , &quot; a bank dealer said . 
a cut in the central bank main interest rate by 8.4 points to 43.08 percent annually , which became effective on Monday , failed to pressure the Lev . 
the Lev closed at around 1,575-1,578 per dollar on Friday . 
dollar demand for pending payments by some final clients rose in the afternoon but foreign currency supply was high enough to counter a Lev drop . 
the mark closed at 928 / 932 levs . 
the French franc changed hands at 274 / 276 levs , tracking the dollar / franc on international markets as local banks were trading francs in the usual light volume . 
the French franc &apos;s share in the local forex market turnover is below one percent .
