interbank rates were little changed on Tuesday with early activity confined to bidding by finance companies for one-month money , dealers said . 
&quot; There &apos;s some interest in the one-month but elsewhere , it &apos;s very quiet , &quot; said a dealer at a Malaysian bank . 
one-week money was at 6.80 / 90 percent against 6.9 / 7.0 on Monday , while two-week and three-week were steady at 7.00 / 10 and 7.10 / 20 percent respectively . 
one-month money at 7.30 / 35 percent against 7.25 / 30 . 
three-month at 7.35 / 40 percent and six-month at 7.40 / 45 , were both unchanged . 
dealers said they expected rates to hover at current levels with players continuing to await announcement of a new long-term government bond issue . 
speculation has been rife that Bank Negara will issue new Malaysian Government Securities ( mgs ) to roll over maturing bonds . 
the overnight interbank rate is expected to stay around 7.0 percent ahead of Wednesday &apos;s 500 million ringgit payment for a 30-day Bank Negara bill issue , dealers said . 
the issue is to roll over maturing bills of the same amount . 
the maturity is on Friday . 
interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were also generally steady . 
at 0300 GMT , the benchmark three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank offered Rate ( KLIBOR ) December contract was unchanged at 92.69 , or an implied yield of 7.31 percent . 
March 1998 was steady at 92.64 , or 7.34 percent .
