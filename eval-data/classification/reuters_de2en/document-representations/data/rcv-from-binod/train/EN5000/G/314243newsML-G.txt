the hunt for men capable of masterminding a victorious Lions tour of South Africa this year will begin in earnest when Scotland kick off their Five Nations campaign against Wales on Saturday . 
it is 12 years since the Welsh won at Murrayfield but the 101st meeting between the two countries also represents a chance to sort out an abnormally large number of contenders for the Lions number 10 jersey . 
coach Ian McGeechan knows all about Gregor Townsend who he sees on a daily basis in English club rugby at Northampton , yet the gifted 23-year-old has spent the season playing most of his rugby at centre . 
that leaves the door ajar at fly-half for the likes of Craig Chalmers and Arwel Thomas , the respective fly-halves on Saturday , as well as two other well-known names pressed into unfamiliar roles . 
record Welsh pointscorer Neil Jenkins finds himself at full-back , while former captain Jonathan Davies will sit on the replacements &apos; bench awaiting the chance to show he still has some magic at his fingertips . 
the Lions pecking order is much less straightforward than it seemed in Cardiff in September when Townsend , Jenkins , Mike Catt of England and David Humphreys of Ireland modelled the new kit the Lions will wear in South Africa . 
perhaps it was a jinx . 
the upshot has been that neither Townsend nor Jenkins will wear the number 10 jersey on Saturday , Humphreys has become third choice for Ireland and Catt is waiting to hear if he will be reprieved by England after his display against Argentina last month . 
Chalmers , who will be winning his 50th cap , believes Wales should have opted for Jenkins with Davies at full-back , and is looking forward to his duel with the diminutive Thomas . 
&quot; Anyone with ambition will naturally want to be in South Africa in the summer . 
but right now all I want to do is to cement my place in the Scotland team . 
Welsh coach Kevin Bowring , in turn , felt the Scots have made an error in keeping Townsend at centre , assuming he suffers no late reaction to the shoulder injury he suffered in training this week . 
&quot; I thought they would have gone for two strong-tackling centres with Townsend at fly-half , but I &apos;m sure they will still use him a lot , enabling the back row to run off him . 
former Welsh captain Steve Fenwick is more blunt . 
&quot; Chalmers is no tackler and Townsend is not a big bloke , so if I was Wales I would look to attack them head-on . 
in the last two years Scotland have won their opening three Five Nations encounters only to lose to England in their final match , but now come face to face with a Welsh side convinced they are on the up . 
&quot; We are the two closest teams in the championship in terms of our attitude towards the game . 
I think it will be a pretty exciting contest , &quot; said Bowring . 
&quot; We were pipped at home by them last year , and I will be happy if we can do likewise to Scotland on Saturday . 
the match could offer a last chance for Welsh winger Ieuan Evans to finish on the winning side against the Scots at Murrayfield . 
in his 69-cap career , Evans has lost four times in Edinburgh and failed to score a try .
