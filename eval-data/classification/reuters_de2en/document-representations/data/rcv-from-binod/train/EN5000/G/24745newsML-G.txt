hurricane Edouard , maintaining its strength of 140 mph ( 225 kph ) , was turning more northward on Friday , posing an indefinite threat to the middle and northern U.S. Atlantic Coast , the National Hurricane Center said . 
hurricane Fran and tropical storm Gustav were also being monitored , said meteorologist Richard Pasch . 
the storm was beginning a northward movement , Pasch said , adding that people from Georgia and North and South Carolina northward should pay attention to weather forecasts ahead of the Labor Day weekend , the traditional end-of-summer holiday . 
Riptides and five- to six-foot ( 1.5- to 1.8-metres ) waves were reported along North Carolina beaches , and swells were expected to reach 12 feet ( 3.6 metres ) on Friday , forecasters said . 
forecasters said computer models indicated a high pressure ridge could force Edouard toward the mid-Atlantic coast in three days . 
in coastal areas of North Carolina battered by Hurricane Bertha in mid-July , residents and business owners took a wait- and-see attitude . 
Motel owners in Hatteras Village said they had had few cancellations as people seemed to be holding to their Labor Day weekend plans , at least for the moment . 
&quot; I think people are waiting to see what it &apos;s going to do , &quot; Katie Oden , owner of the Sea Gull motel , said . 
&quot; It might hurt us even if it does turn , but you got to take it as it comes . 
hurricane Fran remained weak and passed north of the islands of the northeastern Caribbean , Pasch said . 
the storm was a minimal hurricane , with top winds of 75 mph ( 120 kmh ) , and forecasters said little change in strength was expected in the next day . 
Fran &quot; is following the general path of Edouard , &quot; Pasch said , &quot; adding that it was too soon to predict any landfall . 
NASA said on Thursday it was prepared to haul shuttle Atlantis back to its hangar if Edouard or Fran threatened Florida &apos;s Kennedy Space Center . 
tropical Storm Gustav was 900 miles ( 1,448 km ) west of the Cape Verde islands at 5 a.m. ( 0900 GMT ) , Pasch said . 
Gustav was declining in power and could be downgraded below tropical storm status later on Friday . 
&quot; It &apos;s the busiest time of the year for hurricanes , &quot; National Hurricane Center forecaster Bill Fredericks said ( on ( Thursday . 
&quot; The peak of the season is always around the Labor Day holiday .
