Israel and the PLO traded accusations on Monday over a bloody market bombing whose plotters have yet to be traced . 
an aide to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said signs now pointed to militant groups abroad , and insisted that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologise to the Palestinian leader for tough measures Israel has taken against his administration . 
Netanyahu countered that even if the bombers came from outside , they had to be assisted by Arab militants operating under Arafat &apos;s nose . 
&quot; It is a reasonable assumption , based on previous incidents , that wherever they came from , they were assisted by a local group and a local infrastructure , &quot; Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem . 
&quot; This infrastructure is situated , organised and operates within the areas of the Palestinian Authority , &quot; he said . 
two militants blew themselves up at Jerusalem &apos;s main outdoor market last Wednesday , killing 13 people in twin bombings that bore the hallmarks of Islamic suicide attacks . 
a leaflet issued later that day claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of the Moslem Hamas group but both Israel and the PLO have cast doubt on its authenticity . 
Israel has failed to identify the bodies of the two bombers . 
one Israeli official said authorities did not have their fingerprints on record . 
Netanyahu suspended peace talks with the Palestinian Authority after the attack , sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip and vowed to withhold crucial tax and customs revenues due to the Palestinian Authority under peace deals until Arafat cracked down on Islamic militants . 
&quot; There are too many signs that these are people who came from abroad , &quot; said Arafat aide Ahmed tibi , adding that pictures of the perpetrators published in the Palestinian press drew no response . 
previous Islamic bombings have been followed by large wakes at the homes of bombers &apos; families in the West Bank and Gaza Strip . 
Palestinians point to the absence of such wakes this time as proof the bombers came from abroad . 
&quot; In light of all this alleged evidence ... I think the whole campaign against the Palestinian Authority and against Chairman Arafat personally is unnecessary , damaging and inappropriate and Mr Benjamin Netanyahu will do well to phone the chairman and apologise , &quot; he told Israel Radio . 
Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group , main Palestinian opponents of an Israel-PLO conciliation that began in 1993 , have killed scores of Israelis in suicide attacks , including four bombings during a nine-day stretch last year . 
their roles in last year &apos;s bombings prompted the PLO to crack down on the groups . 
Hamas has since avoided taking direct credit for attacks , said an Israeli official who refused to be identified . 
but Israeli security forces have also been on the lookout for militants from abroad seeking to infiltrate the Jewish state &apos;s borders . 
in May 1996 , a Lebanese Shi &apos;ite Moslem guerrilla with a stolen British passport smuggled explosives into Israel , apparently planning to blow up an Israeli airliner , according to Israeli security sources . 
the Hizbollah militant was arrested after seriously injuring himself making a bomb in an East Jerusalem hotel .
