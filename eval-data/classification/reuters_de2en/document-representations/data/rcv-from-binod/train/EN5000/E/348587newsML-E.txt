Australia &apos;s current account deficit for December was A $ 1.408 billion , compared with a A $ 1.893 billion shortfall in November , the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported . 
&quot; The number being right at the bottom of market expectations is a good monthly result for the Aussie dollar . 
sentiment is very , very weak but of course it is so much influenced by the volatility in these monthly export numbers . 
so reading a new trend in the 1.4 ( A $ billion deficit ) would be extremely dangerous . 
it certainly highlights that the underlying deficit is higher than that 1.4 ( A $ billion ) on an ongoing basis , but it is a good monthly result . 
&quot; I think the real reason I &apos;d like to get the champagne corks out for is the fact that it was the last monthly current account release . 
it &apos;s certainly a release whose passing won &apos;t be mourned by many market economists . 
it &apos;s a good result , but these monthly numbers are reasonably volatile and we can &apos;t read too much into that eight percent rise in exports because we had to see a good export performance sometime . 
but what I think is pretty good about these numbers is that now we have got the full year &apos;s current account in , we &apos;ve only got a deficit of about A $ 19.2 billion for 1996 which is much , much better than the A $ 26 billion that we had in 1995 . 
&quot; Clearly some of the pessimism about the current account in some quarters recently has been overstated . 
overall , this is broadly in the type of A $ 1.2 billion and A $ 1.3 billion range that it has been in for some time and it is likely to be in that range at least for the next few months . 
as we go through 1997 though and into 1998 the current account is likely to pick up somewhat . 
&quot; Obviously somewhat better than expected , just seeing it come in at 1.4 ( A $ billion ) after those couple of higher numbers . 
I think we are still certainly very much on track for about a A $ 20 billion figure for the year ( 1996 / 97 to June 30 ) , and in some ways it &apos;s not a bad sort of figure to see out the monthly current account deficit &apos;s passing . 
the particularly good news obviously is that big jump in exports across the board . 
&quot; We weren &apos;t expecting such a rise in exports , but it &apos;s not going to alter our view at all . 
it keeps us on track for a current account deficit of A $ 20 billion for 1996 / 97 , which is in line with the government &apos;s forecast .
