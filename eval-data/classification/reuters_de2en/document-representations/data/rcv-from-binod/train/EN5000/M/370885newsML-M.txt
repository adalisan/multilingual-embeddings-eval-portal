new Zealand long bond yields closed lower on Tuesday mainly as a result of a swap transaction in the 04 bonds . 
dealers said one buyer dominated the market and the trader market was happy to give up stock . 
the bank bill market ended close to Monday &apos;s close after a choppy session mainly dominated by the currency . 
dealers said the market appeared weak at one stage but found new strength when the currency and Trade-Weighted Index rebounded . 
&quot; I think the futures don &apos;t look too bad but technically it doesn &apos;t look that flash , &quot; said a bill dealer . 
bonds are expected to continue to range trade but one Wellington bank chief dealer said yields were close to their medium-term bottom and he expected a gradual rise as growth and inflation pressures fed through . 
dealers said there was mild encouragement for his &quot; business as usual &quot; approach and clear statement that he was not going to interfere with the New Zealand dollar . 
a comment from Alliance Party leader Jim Anderton after meeting the Reserve Bank Governor that Don brash wanted the dollar lower and interest rates higher was dismissed . 
dealers said the market knows brash wants a different mix but he has also acknowledged he can &apos;t achieve it .
