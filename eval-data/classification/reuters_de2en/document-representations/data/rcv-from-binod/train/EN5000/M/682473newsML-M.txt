British interest rate futures have scope for a post-budget rally next week , analysts said on Tuesday . 
but lingering question marks over the degree of fiscal tightening Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown will deliver next Wednesday mean investors should tread carefully , they added . 
&quot; We &apos;ve had a sharp sell-off and may have come far enough -- but you can &apos;t rule out one last big panic going in to the budget , &quot; said David Coleman chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy . 
&quot; But the risk / reward has altered a bit . 
if Brown unveils a tight budget , it should take the pressure off the short end , so there may be a short covering bounce post budget -- maybe even before . 
but analysts added failure by Brown to target fiscal tightening at consumers may send short sterling tumbling again as the onus for stemming surging demand falls entirely on monetary policy . 
&quot; Without doubt , if there is serious fiscal tightening in the budget there &apos;s going to be some bounce in short sterling , &quot; said one gilts salesman at a British bank . 
&quot; But it &apos;s got to be aimed at the consumer , otherwise we &apos;ll be stuck on using monetary policy to choke demand leaving potential downside for the ( short sterling ) strip . 
a stronger than expected rise in May retail sales last Wednesday sent short sterling reeling as investors revised up their interest rate expectations . 
robust growth in May M4 money supply data the following day added to the picture of powerful consumer spending and boosted expectations of an imminent 50 basis point interest rate rise . 
December short sterling plunged 30 basis points in five days to a low of 92.71 on Tuesday , before it bounced back to 92.75 by 1240 GMT . 
the March 1998 contract shed 36 basis points to a low of 92.56 , but also bounced back in early trade to 92.63 , suggesting a degree of short covering already , analysts said . 
with British base rates currently at 6.5 percent and expectations of as much as a half point rise at the next monetary meeting on June 9-10 , there appears to be little value in the strip short term , analysts said . 
&quot; Markets are expecting three-month Libor at 7.25 percent at the end of the year which translates into around 7.0 percent on base rates , &quot; said Brian Hilliard , chief economist at SocGen Strauss Turnbull . 
&quot; That &apos;s not overly aggressive so I would say there &apos;s not a lot of value in the curve . 
but analysts said that at some point prices of back month contracts would have to adjust since the curve was unusually flat . 
the spread between June 1998 and June 2000 , was just three basis points on Tuesday with the former at 92.58 and the latter at 92.55 . 
&quot; That &apos;s also down to the budget , &quot; said the gilts salesman . 
&quot; The whole market is flat but that will have to change , especially if we get a bad set of figures . 
the short end would certainly go down , but the longer end would perhaps be left alone . 
CIBC &apos;s Coleman said the market had rationalised the unusual shape of the curve by convincing itself that the Bank of England would tighten rates very quickly then have a period of stability . 
&quot; It &apos;s saying that all the tightening is going to be done this year and that they &apos;ll be nothing else , &quot; he said . 
&quot; But that &apos;s a bit optimistic so there is some scope for that spread to widen a bit further . 
Hilliard agreed : &quot; The curve is pretty optimistic at present so it wouldn &apos;t take very much to damage that .
