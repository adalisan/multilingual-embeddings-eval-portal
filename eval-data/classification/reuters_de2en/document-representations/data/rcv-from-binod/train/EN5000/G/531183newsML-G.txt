Severiano Ballesteros will not decide until the final day for selection on August 31 whether he will become Europe &apos;s first playing Ryder Cup captain , he said on Wednesday . 
speaking on the eve of the 550,000 pounds ( $ 825,000 ) Spanish Open , Ballesteros refused to rule himself out of the team , even though he has not made one cut in six events this year including his sole American outing , the Masters . 
asked if he had set a decision deadline , he replied : &quot; Some time later . 
when the BMW International is over and the team is announced after August 31 . 
not before . 
&quot; It &apos;s going to be difficult to qualify for the team but I always have the chance to pick myself . 
Europe &apos;s captain for Valderrama currently lies 31st on the Ryder Cup table and faces a mammoth task if he is to make the top 10 automatic selections . 
recently he has turned to the coach who honed the game of man-of-the-moment Tiger Woods , Butch Harmon , to try to rediscover his form . 
&quot; You try coaches like going to different doctors , &quot; added Ballesteros , &quot; and I &apos;ve given Butch a chance now after trying others who were good teachers but not good for me . 
time will tell . 
Ballesteros faces a stiff test to make the event at the 7,054 yards , par-72 La Moraleja II course -where the 1992 World Cup was played , count tellingly for Cup points if he does make his first cut of the year . 
in the field is Australian Greg Norman in his first tour event in Spain for 15 years , having worked a reciprocal deal with Ballesteros to play in each other &apos;s tournaments . 
Ballesteros will now play the Holden classic early next year in Australia . 
Norman was deposed from the world number one spot on Sunday after a record 96 weeks by American Tom Lehman . 
but with Lehman and Zimbabwean Nick Price ( 4th ) not playing this week &apos;s U.S. Tour event , only compatriot Steve Elkington ( 3rd ) stands in the way of Norman returning to top place if he finishes as low as 17th . 
Elkington is playing the U.S. Tour &apos;s Chrysler classic and if he wins and Norman is outside the top six here , Elkington would become world number one for the first time . 
&quot; As far as I &apos;m concerned Tiger Woods is the best player in the world at the moment , and to have a system which says otherwise questions it , &quot; pointed out Norman . 
&quot; But if I win this week and get back to number one then all well and good . 
in a strong Spanish Open field , Irishman Padraig Harrington defends . 
but three Europeans who finished in the top 12 in Augusta , where Norman missed the cut , Costantino Rocca of Italy ( 5th ) , Bernhard Langer of Germany ( 7th ) and Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal ( 12th ) , continuing his comeback , are also among the favourites .
