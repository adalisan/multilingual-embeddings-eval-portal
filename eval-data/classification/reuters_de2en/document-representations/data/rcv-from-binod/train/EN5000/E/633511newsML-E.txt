barely a month before crucial mid-term elections , Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo Tuesday unveiled an ambitious economic plan to boost economic growth and create jobs for recession-weary Mexicans . 
the plan , jointly presented by Zedillo and Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz , aims for economic growth of 5 percent on average until the millennium and promises to cut inflation to 7.5 percent by the year 2000 . 
&quot; Our perseverance is starting to bear fruit , &quot; Zedillo said at a ceremony at his official residence , Los Pinos . 
in a speech directed as much at foreign investors as to Mexican voters , Ortiz vowed the administration would never allow Mexico to suffer another financial crisis like the 1994-1995 peso crash . 
Mexico &apos;s economy is forecast to grow by 4.5 percent this year , after rising by 5.1 percent in 1996 . 
but Ortiz forecast growth rising yearly to 5.6 percent by 2000 , a presidential election year . 
he also forecast private savings of 18 percent by the end of the century from 16 percent at present , and investment rising to 25 percent of gross domestic product . 
economists in Mexico and abroad said the targets looked optimistic , especially for growth and inflation , while others said projections for higher domestic savings were ambitious given the level of household debt . 
others questioned how the government could confidently set such targets just a month before mid-term congressional elections , in which the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party looks destined to loose its majority in Congress . 
&quot; There is a question mark over how the new Congress will affect ( the plan ) , &quot; said Ann Ginsberg , economist at Valores Finamex . 
but one government official said Tuesday &apos;s announcement was an electoral coup for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( pri ) , raising the political cost for the opposition if it tried to deviate from a programme . 
he said it also raised the stakes for the conservative National Action Party ( PAN ) opposition , forcing it to come out in the open on whether or not it would back the pri on economic policy if the pri loses its long-held congressional majority . 
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador , president of the left-wing opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) , was scathing . 
&quot; We think there is no sense in talking about macroeconomic recovery if this is not reflected in the pockets and on the tables of Mexico , &quot; he said .
