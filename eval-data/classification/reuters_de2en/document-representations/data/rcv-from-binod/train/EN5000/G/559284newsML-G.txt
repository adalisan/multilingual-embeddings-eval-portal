Albania will be thrown back into chaos if political parties cannot reach a compromise over arrangements for a general election , a group of European politicians said on Monday . 
leaders from the Council of Europe &apos;s Parliamentary Assembly said there seemed to be a chance for Albania &apos;s political parties to reach a package of compromises so the poll could proceed on June 29 . 
however , Albanian President Sali Berisha &apos;s refusal to compromise over citizens &apos; committees , set up in some towns as Albania slid towards anarchy in March , was a stumbling block in talks . 
he insists they are disbanded before the election . 
&quot; If there was to be no election ... it means chaos for Albania , &quot; Jaakko Laakso , a Finnish member of the United European Left , told a news conference after two days of talks by the European politicians in the capital Tirana . 
&quot; It concerns the salvation and fate of Albania to have elections now . 
Peter Scheider , of the Socialist Group , said a compromise package seemed possible from all the parties involved in an interim multi-party government . 
&quot; The only person who did not see a chance to reach such a package and was clearly against it was the president , &quot; said Scheider , an Austrian . 
&quot; It must be one of the jobs of the parties to convince the president . 
Prime Minister Bashkim Fino , a Socialist , heads the nine-party interim government that was formed on March 9 . 
its right-wing Democratic Party predecessor resigned amid a wave of violence over the collapse of popular , high-risk savings funds . 
to stop the slide towards chaos , Berisha agreed to appoint the interim government and call a fresh election . 
this calmed passions among Albanians still smarting from a poll last May , described by international observers as seriously flawed , which gave the Democrats a landslide victory . 
but the Democrats and the Socialists have to agree on a list of issues . 
these include the number of seats to be decided by proportional representation , constitutional changes , and the treatment of citizens &apos; groups or salvation committees , which sprang up as law and order disintegrated . 
some Albanian politicians see the committees as bridging the gap before local governments , the police and army resume control . 
others say the committees are run by armed , criminal gangs with political motives , making a free and fair poll impossible . 
&quot; I think it is critical ... these bands are disbanded , &quot; said Norwegian Hallgrim Berg , of the European Democratic Group . 
Parliament has to agree on the proposed election by May 15 for the poll to be able to proceed on June 29 . 
&quot; It has become progressively clearer .. that the way in which these committees are to be dealt with is likely to be the critical issue , &quot; said Briton Sir Russell Johnston , of the Liberal , Democratic and Reformers group . 
&quot; It seems to us in the other important areas -- the election law , the question of the genocide law , the question of television time for the election -- compromise is possible . 
Fino and the other party leaders in the interim government were due to meet later on Monday to continue discussions .
