a corruption probe into alleged links between the Rome judiciary and building firms has shattered Italy &apos;s summer calm , sending politicians , magistrates and tycoons rushing from the beaches to their lawyers &apos; offices . 
newspapers reported on Wednesday that more than 30 people are under official investigation in the case , which is being spearheaded by magistrates in the central city of Perugia . 
a further 70 are expected to give evidence before the end of the month in an investigation which has re-ignited interest in Italy &apos;s faltering campaign to root out high-level corruption . 
the probes have already forced the head of the anti-Mafia police to resign while Minister for Foreign Trade Augusto Fantozzi was forced to break off his holiday last week to explain his links with a leading suspect in the inquiries . 
the case revolves around one of Rome &apos;s top tax experts , Sergio Melpignano , and building magnate Domenico Bonifaci . 
both men are being held in prison while magistrates look into charges that they controlled huge slush funds to corrupt Rome judges in cases such as the infamous Enimont scandal , a major milestone in the mass graft probes of the early 1990s . 
a Perugia court on Wednesday rejected a defence bid to have Bonifaci and Melpignano released from jail . 
&quot; Not only does there remain serious evidence of guilt , as seen in the custody order , but this evidence has been hardened by subsequent investigations , &quot; the court ruling said . 
unlike in previous probes headed by the elite anti-graft team of &quot; Clean Hands &quot; prosecutors in Milan , Perugia magistrates have kept largely tight-lipped about their inquiries and few details have emerged in Italy &apos;s normally well-informed press . 
but newspapers agree that the case has sucked in a host of well-known figures from the Rome establishment . 
&quot; At the centre of the investigations are ( Rome &apos;s ) most important construction chiefs , &quot; the daily Corriere della Sera said on Wednesday . 
&quot; The probe will cause perhaps 100 people to miss their end-of August holidays , &quot; it added . 
Fantozzi was so worried by the implications of the case that , when old photographs were published last week of him leaving a cafe with Melpignano , he ended his summer break and rushed to Perugia to explain what he had been doing . 
the minister , who is not under investigation in the case , said he had merely sought to use Melpignano &apos;s influence to get a Rome newspaper to stop printing unfavourable articles about him . 
this admission drew mutterings of disapproval from some government allies but Prime Minister Romano Prodi rallied to his defence and said it was not a matter for him to resign over . 
Perugia magistrates believe Melpignano and Bonifaci controlled numerous slush funds , including some 39 billion lire ( $ 21.6 million ) earmarked for bribes in the Enimont case . 
the Enimont scandal was the single most important case to emerge from the vast &quot; Clean Hands &quot; graft investigations that broke in 1992 and toppled Italy &apos;s corrupt political old guard . 
it involved the chemical company Montedison , which paid more than $ 100 million in kickbacks to extricate itself from a disastrous joint venture with state energy company ENI .
