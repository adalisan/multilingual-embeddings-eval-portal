U.S. economic figures will take a back seat in the week ahead , allowing a scattering of data releases from other countries to take precedence in financial markets , analysts say . 
Teis Knuthsen , international economist at First Chicago in London , said Friday &apos;s durable goods data for September will be overshadowed by the prospect of non-farm payrolls data for the same month , due on November 1 . 
data released earlier in October showed a surprise fall in the all-important payrolls number , backing the Federal Reserve &apos;s decision to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged in September . 
&quot; Until that unexpected ... drop is either confirmed or rejected by the next payrolls report , all the other U.S. data will be secondary , &quot; he said . 
durable goods data alone were unlikely to be sufficiently influential to change market sentiment , analysts said . 
&quot; durable goods figures are very volatile numbers , &quot; said Nick Stamenkovic , economist at DKB International in London . 
&quot; After last month &apos;s fall we should see some rebound , but that on its own isn &apos;t going to be enough to turn sentiment around . 
the August figure showed a fall of 3.1 percent , but analysts forecast a September rise of 1.8 percent . 
in Germany , the focus will be figures for the broad M3 measure of money supply in September , expected early in the week . 
a Reuters poll predicted an 8.4 percent rise in the year-on-year rate of growth compared with 8.7 percent in August . 
Stamenkovic said a figure of 8.1 percent would reignite hopes of a cut in the key German repo rate , now 3.0 percent . 
he said strong survey evidence and the weak mark had taken the pressure off the Bundesbank to ease rates , but he still expected a 25 basis point cut by the end of the year . 
the forecast is for quarter-on-quarter rise of 0.4 percent , and a year-on-year rise of 2.3 percent . 
&quot; GDP is most important because it has potential to make a significant change in the market &apos;s outlook , &quot; said Smith . 
&quot; There has been a sentiment swing to expect a rate hike before March . 
he said there was some talk that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Ken Clarke would raise interest rates as soon as October 30 , to avoid having to raise them just before the general election . 
Britain &apos;s ruling Conservative government must call a general election by the end of May 1997 . 
British retail sales data for September are also due for release on Wednesday , with expectations for a monthly fall of 0.1 percent . 
but Smith said he expected the crucial consumer figures to surprise the market , with a drop of 0.8 percent . 
&quot; We are expecting to see a hefty fall in retail sales which the market hasn &apos;t priced in , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The message it will give is that consumers aren &apos;t accepting price increases . 
Monday also sees the start of a two-day Bank of Japan regional managers &apos; meeting , where BOJ governor Yasuo Matsushita was scheduled to deliver a speech . 
analysts said the meeting was expected to show that Japanese interest rates were on hold for the time being . 
the outcome of Japan &apos;s general election on Sunday will also be watched closely by the markets , although most believe Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashiimoto &apos;s Liberal Democratic Party is poised to win . 
some political analysts forecast a possible landslide . 
national Japanese consumer price data for September is due for release on Friday , with a year-on-year fall of 0.2 percent forecast by the markets . 
French consumer prices are also due at the end of the week , and analysts say a weak number would unsettle the markets . 
&quot; If growth in France and Germany diverges it will increase scepticism about plans for a single currency , &quot; said Smith .
