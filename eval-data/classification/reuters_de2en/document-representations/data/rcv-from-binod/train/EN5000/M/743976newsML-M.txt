guilder rates held steady in quiet trade on Monday , with the upcoming Friday expiry of money market cash reserve posing few problems , dealers said . 
call money was quoted fractionally up at 3.12 percent bid from 3.06 percent last Friday but volumes were tiny , they said . 
under the cash reserve arrangement , money market players are required to maintain a minimum reserve at the central bank . 
at times its expiry can result in a last-minute liquidity shortage , but this was currently not a factor , traders said . 
the guilder held up against the mark , quoting at 112.57 per 100 marks compared with Friday &apos;s 112.58 fixing .
