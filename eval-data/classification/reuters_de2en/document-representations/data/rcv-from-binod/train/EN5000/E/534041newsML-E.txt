the Bundesbank on Wednesday restated its opposition to International Monetary Fund gold sales , saying these could hurt the IMF &apos;s credibility . 
the IMF has for some time been considering the sale of a small amount of its gold reserves to top up its Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility , which offers low-cost loans to poor countries . 
the additional funds are needed to bridge a gap of up to five years between the end of the year 2000 , when a shortage of funds is expected to arise , and 2005 , when the facility will become self-financing . 
Germany has led a small group of countries which oppose the idea of gold sales , effectively blocking the plan . 
in its 1996 annual report , the Bundesbank said , &quot; From the German point of view the proposed sale of IMF gold to finance the interim-ESAF is to be rejected in just the same way as proposals to use regular IMF funds for this . 
it argued that the gold reserves gave the IMF the &quot; financial integrity &quot; to carry out its main mandate of surveillance of its member countries &apos; economic and exchange rate policies and the offer of temporary aid when needed . 
&quot; The attempt to resolve the problem of financing the ESAF by resorting to the use of regular Fund monies or through gold sales would also weaken the Fund and damage its credibility as a monetary institution , &quot; the Bundesbank said . 
it proposed a resolution to the temporary financing of the ESAF by extending the use of current funds and seeking voluntary bilateral contributions from member states .
