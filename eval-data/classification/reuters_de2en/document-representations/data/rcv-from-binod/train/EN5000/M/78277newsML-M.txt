Mexican stocks closed sharply lower due to technical factors and lack of investor interest , but the declines were limited by a partial late recovery in market heavyweight Telmex . 
&quot; There were a lot of orders to buy Telmex towards the close , and that picked us up a bit , &quot; a floor trader said . 
the blue chip IPC index closed down 34.97 points , or 1.07 percent , at 3,239.53 , but above a session low of 3,213.63 . 
Telmex , which has a weighting of some 30 percent in the IPC closed at 12.00 pesos ( $ 1.59 ) , 2 centavos down ( 1 cent ) but off an early low of 11.82 pesos ( $ 1.57 ) 
the percentage gainers list was dominated by financial groups Abaco and GBMatla . 
Abaco L series shares gained 34 centavos ( 5 cents ) to 2.46 pesos ( 33 cents ) on speculation and GBMatla A series gained 41 centavos ( 5 cents ) to 4.51 pesos ( 60 cents ) on small cross trades . 
&quot; As well as being a stock that lends itself to same-day buy-sell trades , there are rumours that its banking division will raise capital , &quot; a trader said about Abaco . 
the percentage loss leaders &apos; list included mostly low volume trades , and the only appreciable trade was in publishing stock GFesa , which fell 14 centavos ( 2 cents ) to 2.50 pesos ( 33 cents ) is not frequently traded . 
a total of 112 stocks changed hands , of which losers outnumbered winners by 63 to 21 
technical analysts pointed out that the IPC had broken through an important support at 3,260 points . 
&quot; Now we &apos;ve broken through the support , the correction may extend to the 3,180-point mark . 
the good news is that volume has improved and new capital may now flow in , &quot; said one analyst . 
&quot; What it needs is more liquidity . 
if we fall a little more , buyers will step in to snap up bargains , &quot; he added .
