the opposition Labour party , doing its utmost to upstage Prime Minister John Major &apos;s last party conference before the election , on Thursday used a new recruit to poke fun at the government -- a puppet . 
the latex puppet of Major from the popular satirical television show , &quot; Spitting Image &quot; , was the star of a Labour party political broadcast aired on all Britain &apos;s four main channels . 
the puppet , grey from head to toe to poke fun at Major &apos;s image as a colourless politician , was shown in a series of disastrous historical situations trying to think of ideas for his keynote conference speech on Thursday . 
as captain of the Titanic as it hit the iceberg , a fiddling Emperor Nero amid the flames of Rome and a French aristocrat on his way to the guillotine , Major at each scene was doomed and derided by members of his government -- also puppets . 
each scene was also used to attack the government record on policies like crime , housing and the economy . 
it ended with a puppet of the cat who lives at Major &apos;s Downing Street offices escaping and knocking on the door of a grinning puppet of Labour leader , Tony Blair . 
as the real Blair intoned &quot; After years of broken promises , enough is enough , come home to Labour &quot; , the cat slipped inside . 
major has presented a show of party unity at the conference , the last before an election which must be held by May . 
but Labour is far ahead in polls . 
its use of puppets was just another example of the slick media and marketing techniques adopted by Labour under Blair , who has attracted thousands of new , young recruits to the party as he has shifted it from the left to the centre . 
&quot; Spitting Image &quot; , the show created by puppetmakers Peter Fluck and Roger Law , enraged and intrigued the politicians , showbusiness stars and sporting figures who became its victims until its 12-year history ended in a final series last year . 
the concept has been franchised around the world and puppetmakers from Moscow to Tokyo have begun giving their stars and politicians the same treatment . 
major , battling to take his party back into office for a fifth term , is in good company . 
his predecessor , Margaret Thatcher , was turned into one of &quot; Spitting Image &apos;s &quot; best-selling spin-offs -- around 120,000 Thatcher puppets were sold .
