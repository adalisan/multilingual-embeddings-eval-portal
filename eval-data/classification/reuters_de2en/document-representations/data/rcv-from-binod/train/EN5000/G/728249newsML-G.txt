Pakistan captain Rameez Raja has warned his players that Bangladesh will be tough opponents in their Asia Cup match on Wednesday . 
Pakistan , who lost by 15 runs to Sri Lanka on Monday , know they must beat the ICC trophy winners at Colombo &apos;s R. Premadasa Stadium to stay in contention for the cup . 
&quot; Bangladesh is not an easy match , &quot; Rameez told Reuters . 
&quot; They ( Bangladesh ) have come here to play one-day cricket and I am expecting a fight from them . 
&quot; As I have said on so many occasions , the team that plays well on a particular day wins . 
if we focus on what we are to do , we can do it . 
we want to win this cup desperately . 
Pakistan are not expected to make any major changes to the side which lost to Sri Lanka . 
Bangladesh captain Akram Khan said his team were well prepared but looking to the future . 
&quot; We performed well in all departments to win the ICC trophy in Malaysia early this year but we are up against superior opposition here , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Our approach is to play positive and good cricket and prepare a team for the next World Cup in England in 1999 . 
&quot; tournaments like the Asia Cup provide us with the opportunity to assess our strengths and weaknesses towards achieving that goal . 
Bangladesh , who have received tremendous help from West Indian coach Gordon Greenidge , have made five changes to their team which won the ICC trophy .
