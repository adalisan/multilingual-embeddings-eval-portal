the Mexican bourse was still down in slow midday dealings on Thursday but had recouped some earlier losses , as foreign bargain hunters stepped in on cue from strong trade data . 
&quot; We &apos;re down but the market is calm , bottom-fishers step in each time it dips . 
many prices began to pick up when the trade balance data came out , &quot; a floor trader said . 
the leading IPC share index was down 30.00 points , or 0.62 percent , at 4,806.49 . 
the IPC had earlier reached as low as 4,793.99 on what dealers said was profit-taking after an extended record-breaking run . 
trading volume was much reduced from earlier sessions this week at 52.1 million shares . 
the Finance Ministry announced mid-morning it had revised Mexico &apos;s trade surplus for May up to $ 220 million , from a preliminary figure of $ 88 million . 
traders said the data alleviated fears the peso may no longer have been competitively priced for exporters . 
dealers said foreign buyers were tending to favor telecomms firm Telefonos de Mexico ( Telmex ) and paper company Kimberly-Clark de Mexico . 
Telmex had gained 20 centavos to 21.10 pesos , while paper company Kimberly-Clark Mexico was down 10 centavos at 37.00 pesos but had recovered from an earlier low of 36.85 pesos . 
on the broad market , sliders outpaced gainers by 45 to 39 .
