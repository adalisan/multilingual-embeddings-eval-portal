Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides was expected in Athens on Thursday to formulate a common line with Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis over how to handle Turkish threats over a missile purchase by Cyprus . 
&quot; The common Athens-Nicosia line towards Turkey will be reaffirmed during the visit . 
Cyprus does not stand alone in this dispute , &quot; a government official told Reuters . 
Clerides , acommpanied by a number of his senior ministers , will meet Simitis on Friday and probably again on Saturday . 
Turkey , which controls the northern third of Cyprus , has threatened several times last week to use force in Cyprus to halt the deployment of the Russian-made missile system , raising the spectre of a wider conflict with fellow NATO member Greece . 
U.S. envoy Carey Cavanaugh ended a trip in the area on Thursday saying a potential crisis had been averted after a promise by Greek Cypriot officials that the anti-aircraft missiles won &apos;t be installed for another 16 months . 
&quot; This visit has turned out to be a successful diplomatic mission in what the United States was concerned could have been a crisis atmosphere , &quot; Cavanaugh told a news conference in Ankara after stops in Cyprus and Athens . 
but Turkey has discounted some of Cavanaugh &apos;s optimism , saying the 16-month timeframe is meaningless because the S-300 missiles were not due to be delivered until mid-1998 anyway . 
Ankara has not backed down on its threats to strike and the Greek Cypriots insist they will still set up the missile system . 
Greece says Cyprus is an independent state and has the right to safeguard its territory with the purchase of new weapons . 
the U.S. have opposed the missile purchase but have sternly warned Ankara against striking in Cyprus . 
Cyprus has been divided since Turkey invaded in 1974 in response to a Greek Cypriot coup engineered by the military government then ruling Greece . 
Ankara maintains some 30,000 troops in a self-declared Turkish Cypriot state in the north . 
Athens has a defence pact with the Greek Cypriot administration , regarded internationally as the island &apos;s only legitimate government .
