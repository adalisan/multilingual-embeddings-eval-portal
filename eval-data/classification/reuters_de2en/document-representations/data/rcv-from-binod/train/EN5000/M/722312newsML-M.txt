traders said scattered pieces of physical gas oil was heard sold to China with a parcel of less than 20,000 tonnes done at $ 156.50 per tonne , cost-and-freight basis for end-July , and another 30,000-tonne lot heard done at around $ 155- $ 156 per tonne . 
current fob values were seen around $ 19.80- $ 20.00 per barrel . 
Naphtha swaps remained in backwardation following a spate of physical purchases by a Thai petrochemical company which eased the physical overhang traders said . 
traders said Thai aromatics usually processes condensate for petrochemical production and the ongoing flurry of near-term naphtha purchases may signal some technical trouble with their facilities . 
as a result of the purchases , a 10-to-15-cent backwardation was established in the monthly time spreads over the three third quarter months . 
August was quoted at $ 21.10 / $ 21.20 and September bid at $ 21.00 , brokers said . 
traders said the strength was also due to increased ethylene production in Japan . 
fuel oil swaps edged lower from morning levels , following up on the fall due to the overnight overnight 26-cent drop in August Brent which closed at $ 17.96 per barrel , brokers said . 
July was last quoted at $ 98.75 / $ 99.50 , down from Thursday &apos;s $ 99.50 / $ 100.25 , while August lost 25 cents from Thursday to $ 98.50 / $ 99.00 .
