King Hussein of Jordan has urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to implement all accords with the Palestinians to overcome a growing crisis between the two sides , the official Petra news agency said . 
it said the king telephoned Netanyahu on Thursday night after Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti met Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in the West Bank town of Ramallah . 
King Hussein &quot; stressed the need to implement the agreements signed between Israel and the Palestinian side and to work to prevent a deterioration in the situation , to confront all the difficulties which confront the peace process and to emerge from the current crisis &quot; , the agency said . 
it quoted Netanyahu as saying in reply his government was committed to implementing the self-rule accords which the previous Labour government signed with the Palestinians . 
Netanyahu &apos;s government , which took office in June , has lifted a freeze on Jewish settlement building in the West Bank and Gaza Strip imposed by the previous government in 1992 . 
its announcement on Tuesday of plans to build a new neighbourhood on a West Bank settlement sparked accusations from Arafat that the Jewish state was declaring war on Palestinians . 
Kabariti , visiting the West Bank for the first time as prime minister , said Israeli attempts to talk peace while building new settlements were futile . 
&quot; We informed the president ( Arafat ) that we do not accept any analysis that calls for continuing settlement expansion and at the same time to say that the peace process is all right , &quot; he said . 
Israel rushed police reinforcements to Jerusalem and tightened its closure of the West Bank in response to Arafat &apos;s call for Palestinians to converge on the holy city for Moslem prayers on Friday .
