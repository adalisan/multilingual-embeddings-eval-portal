the government of Mexico , a country with a history of electoral fraud charges , pledged Tuesday to hold clean mid-term elections on July 6 . 
&quot; The upcoming elections will demonstrate legality , transparency and equality , &quot; Interior Minister Emilio Chuayffet told legislators . 
Mexicans will elect all 500 members of the lower house of Congress , one-fourth of the Sentate , six state governors and a mayor for Mexico City . 
&quot; The main concern of candidates and the political parties is no longer transparency , but electoral competition , &quot; said Chuaffet , who is charged with maintaining internal security and is a powerful member of President Ernesto Zedillo &apos;s cabinet . 
the elections are widely seen as a major test for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( pri ) , which has dominated Mexican elections since coming to power in 1929 .
