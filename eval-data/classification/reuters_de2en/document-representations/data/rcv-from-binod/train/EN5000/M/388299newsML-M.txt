Eagle-Picher Industries , the U.S. germanium producer , said the U.S. government should speed up its sale of surplus germanium to help plug the supply gap , and keep prices from staying too high which has encouraged substitution . 
&quot; I think the stockpile should sell 10 tonnes a year for four years rather than 4 tonnes a year for ten years , &quot; Dennis Thomas , Eagle-Picher &apos;s general manager told Reuters . 
Thomas was attending a meeting here called by the Defense National stockpile Center to discuss the U.S. government &apos;s first sale of germanium in several years . 
any change to the amount up for sale would have to be approved by the Congressional market impact committee , Connelly said . 
for 1997 Thomas forecast global output of 75 tonnes of fresh production , and 30 tonnes of recycled metal , the latter a 50 percent increase on 1996 . 
&quot; This year total demand will probably be 125 tonnes , &quot; he added . 
the gap in supply will have to be plugged by stockpiles . 
Thomas estimated that last year some 5 to 8 tonnes of market share was lost as high metal prices prompted consumers to use rival materials , especially in applications such as PET plastics used in packaging , and positron emission tomography equipment in CAT scans . 
Eagle-Picher wanted to see more stockpile material offloaded in the near-term to bridge the gap until more metal from elsewhere comes on stream in the coming years . 
&quot; I would say 50 percent of the germanium used in the world could be recycled , &quot; Thomas said . 
Eagle-Picher &apos;s second biggest customer who deals in fiber optics , has never recycled metal but will begin doing so this year , reducing their offtake of virgin production . 
nevertheless the expectation of stockpile sales has begun to dampen prices , Thomas said . 
in January the Ukraine announced it sold some 4 tonnes of germanium , and Thomas believed this was the end of the Ukrainian stockpile . 
&quot; My understanding is there is 8.5 tonnes of metal left in the Russian stockpile and 29 tonnes of germanium dioxide , but I don &apos;t know how much of it is going to move , &quot; Thomas said . 
he also noted that Japan , which bought more than 50 percent of its annual requirements in one application in 1995 were largely out of the market last year . 
&quot; They could be serious buyers in 1997 . 
there is potential demand from them and they could be bidding for the germanium oxide from Russia .
