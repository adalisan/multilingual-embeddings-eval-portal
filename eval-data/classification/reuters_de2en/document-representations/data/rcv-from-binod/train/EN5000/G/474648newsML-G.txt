France asked the European Union on Friday to call an emergency meeting of senior foreign ministry officials to seeks ways of salvaging the faltering Middle East peace process , the French Foreign Ministry said . 
&quot; France this morning asked the presidency of the Middle East peace process group of the EU to call an emergency meeting at directors &apos; level , &quot; ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt told reporters . 
he said Foreign Minister Herve de Charette had discussed the issue with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa who asked for a European initiative in the peace process . 
&quot; Minister de Charette shares his Egyptian colleague &apos;s point of view , &quot; he said . 
Rummelhardt also remarked that the closing off by Israel of Palestinian self-ruled territories after a suicide bomb attack in Tel Aviv &quot; punished an entire population &quot; . 
he said Palestinians should be allowed unfettered access to their Jerusalem holy sites during the holiday period . 
the French call for new EU action came as U.S. presidential envoy Dennis Ross shuttled between Israelis and Palestinians in an attempt to rescue Middle East peace . 
Ross met Palestinian negotiators in Jerusalem for two hours on Friday before heading into a meeting with Israel &apos;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Foreign Minister David Levy and Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai .
