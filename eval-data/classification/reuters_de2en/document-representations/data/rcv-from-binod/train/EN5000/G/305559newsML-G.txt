police kept their distance during a peaceful anti-government demonstration in Haiti &apos;s capital on Tuesday in stark contrast to a clash that seriously wounded one man during a protest last week . 
about 200 demonstrators , a few of whom carried gasoline in bags , yelled threats to police during the march , singing &quot; If you shoot , we will burn you . 
but march leaders maintained order and one man was stopped from throwing a Molotov cocktail . 
last Thursday , Dieuseul Sibil , 23 , had his hand blown off when he picked up a tear gas grenade thrown by police during a demonstration . 
while police and demonstrators never directly clashed on Tuesday , there was a mist of mace in the air at times during the march after police cars passed by . 
the demonstrators showed their defiance by burning a tire in front of two patrol cars near the National Palace . 
the burning of tires , which are piled on corners for small repair businesses , is the most common manner of expressing political dissatifaction in Haiti . 
police arrested two men on Monday for possession of tires and gasoline , saying they were trying to cause disorder . 
Tuesday &apos;s demonstration was part of a week-long effort by more than 100 popular organisations calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Rosny Smarth , who they say cannot solve the impoverished country &apos;s problems . 
both parliamentarians and the popular organisations are against plans to privatise nine key government-run businesses , a policy championed by Smarth and President Rene Preval . 
both Smarth and Preval defended their economic vision before parliament on Monday , saying Haiti needs to depend on the international community . 
privatisation will allow Haiti to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and grants from international monetary institutions . 
unemployment has reached as high as 80 percent in Haiti , where the majority of people earn less than $ 100 per year .
