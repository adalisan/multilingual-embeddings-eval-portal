Argentine President Carlos Menem , heading to Washington this week , denied on Monday he would seek U.S. approval on anti-corruption measures or sound out opinion about his former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo . 
Cavallo was sacked in July after doing a widely praised job reforming the economy . 
he is now on a lone crusade against graft which could land him in jail for slander -- something economists warn would damage Argentina &apos;s image abroad . 
Top-selling newspaper Clarin reported on Sunday that Menem wants to know from bankers he meets on Wall Street on Wednesday whether Cavallo is a &quot; lone sniper &quot; or whether his allegations of a cover-up in high places have credibility abroad . 
&quot; I have no reason to go and ask the United States about Cavallo , who no longer belongs to the government , &quot; Peronist leader Menem , who will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday in Washington , told a small group of foreign correspondents . 
Cavallo has accused two senior Menem ministers , his chief of staff and Supreme Court judges of covering up corruption . 
one minister is suing and Cavallo fears he may be jailed . 
but he refuses to back down and has announced he wants to run for Congress next year and for president in the future . 
Menem , whose re-election in May 1995 was largely thanks to Cavallo &apos;s reforms , praised him as a &quot; brilliant ex-minister , &quot; but said his departure and subsequent criticisms had not undermined the continued progress of the economy . 
&quot; Everyone feared Cavallo &apos;s departure from government would make things difficult . 
on the contrary , the economic model has been consolidated , &quot; said Menem , forecasting growth this year of at least 4 percent and more than 5 percent next year . 
the president also bridled at the suggestion that he needed U.S. approval for the fight against corruption . 
&quot; I don &apos;t have to give account of myself to the United States on this . 
anyway , we should also ask about corruption in the United States , or don &apos;t you think they have corruption ? 
&quot; Menem said . 
he recalled that one of the biggest graft scandals here in recent years involved the Argentine unit of U.S. computer giant International Business machines Corp. 
Clinton will visit Argentina between March and July 1997 , a trip he did not make in his first term despite relations that are generally so cozy that Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella once described them as &quot; carnal .
