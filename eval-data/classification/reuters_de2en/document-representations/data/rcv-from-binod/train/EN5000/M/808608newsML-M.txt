Egyptian share prices on Tuesday scored their highest rise in two weeks . 
the Capital Market Authority overall index closed 1.93 points higher at 339.43 , the highest level since August 5 , in below-average trade of 39.96 million pounds ( $ 11.8 million ) . 
&quot; The number of shares which went up were almost double the number of shares that went down . 
this is a good indicator , &quot; Shawkat Raslan of Prime Investments told Reuters . 
&quot; The whole market is going up , but slowly . 
most people in the market now are long-term ( investors ) , &quot; he added . 
the blue-chip Abu Qir fertilisers and Chemical Industries performed well , ending 2.95 pounds up at 77.61 but volume was a relatively low 783,000 pounds . 
&quot; The volume was low because shareholders do not want to sell , particularly after the firm announced it was allowed to export fertilizers after a two-year ban , increasing profits by 15 percent , &quot; Raslan said . 
Suez cement , a favourite in the cement sector , was among the busiest stocks of the day , with 3.4 million pounds of trade . 
the equity rose 0.38 pounds to 64.82 . 
the company &apos;s GDRs which trade on the London stock exchange are priced at a higher level and this makes the local share attractive , Raslan said . 
&quot; The problem with this firm is that there is a large number of shares in the market and that &apos;s why it moves very slowly , &quot; he added . 
a strong performance by Housing and Development Bank pushed its share up 1.89 pounds to clost at 87.89 . 
&quot; It was reported that the bank made 31.9 million pounds of profits in the first six months of this year against about 42 million in the whole of 1996 , &quot; Raslan said . 
Egyptian Electro cables was a victim of a government announcement that an anchor investor was sought to buy the firm &apos;s shares , still held by the state , at 110 pounds a share , Raslan said . 
the equity shed 1.33 pounds to end at 99.14 . 
the index for openly traded firms rose to 470.08 points from 462.71 points on Monday and that for the rarely traded &quot; closed &quot; firms rose to 249.62 from 249.47 .
