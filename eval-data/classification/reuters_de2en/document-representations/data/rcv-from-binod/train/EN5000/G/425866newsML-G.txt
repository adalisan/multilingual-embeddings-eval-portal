American Larry Barber shot a two-under-par 70 for a two-day total of 136 to share the lead with Lee Westwood of Britain at the midway point of the Malaysian Open on Friday . 
Westwood chalked up an even-par 72 after setting a course record of eight-under-par 64 on the opening day . 
&quot; I reckon shooting 72 after a 64 is not all a bad thing , &quot; Westwood said . 
&quot; The pressure is off me now that I &apos;m level and not in front . 
Barber , son of former top golfer Miller Barber , said : &quot; The first 10 holes today were about the best I have ever played . 
unfortunately the next eight were not so hot . 
American Christian Chernock and Harumitsu Hamano of Japan were two shots behind the leaders .
