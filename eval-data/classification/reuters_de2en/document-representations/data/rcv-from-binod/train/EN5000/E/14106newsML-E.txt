export earnings from the free Export Processing Zone in Mauritius are expected to reach 20.5 billion rupees ( $ 1 billion ) in 1996 , a top Mauritius EPZ Association ( MEPZA ) official said on Monday . 
&quot; Big customers from France and England who left Mauritius five to six years ago and went to other sources are gradually coming back to us , &quot; MEPZA chairman Francois woo told Reuters . 
&quot; They say producers in Mauritius are more reliable in terms of delivery and quality , &quot; woo added . 
in 1995 , the Mauritian EPZ sector exported 18.3 billion rupees worth of manufactured goods , mainly clothing items such as shirts , pullovers and casual wear . 
&quot; The tough winter in Europe also helped to boost demand for our ( clothing ) products this year as stocks in our export markets quickly got depleted . 
Mauritian book orders are full until summer 1997 , &quot; said woo , who is also managing director of leading textile producing units in Mauritius . 
export of textile products through the EPZ was the main engine behind the economic turnaround which Mauritius staged during the second half of the 1980s . 
but with rapid wage increases in late 1980s , Mauritian textile products lost their competitive edge at the turn of the decade and the traditional European customers went to other countries with much lower production costs . 
the &quot; Made in Mauritius &quot; label was recently seen attracting renewed interest from these customers as local production units improved their product quality and customers service . 
&quot; It &apos;s not mere luck that these customers are coming back to us . 
Mauritian manufacturing firms have been through a sort of filtering . 
the non performing ones died but this is like a natural ( selection ) process . 
on the other hand , we have also witnessed the survival of the fittest , &quot; woo said . 
firms operating in the Mauritian EPZ totalled 481 units at end 1995 , down from an all time high of 591 in 1988 , figures from the Central Statistical Office show . 
&quot; Some years back EPZ firms were thought to be heading towards a sure death because of world trade liberalisation . 
but if the ones remaining continue to improve themselves , we have every good reason to be more optimistic now , &quot; woo said . 
he cited two reasons why EPZ firms in Mauritius are still upbeat : investments in high technology manufacturing and improved quality of products and services . 
woo said EPZ investments in new equipment remained erratic with an expected 700 million rupees in 1996 , up from 400 million rupees in 1995 , but down from 1.2 billion rupees in 1992 . 
he said a nation-wide consciousness campaign on improving product quality over the past few years also helped to improve the international image of the Mauritian manufacturing base . 
&quot; As compared to five years back , there is no longer any need to convince people that the customer is king , &quot; woo said . 
woo said Mauritius as a manufacturing base suffered from two major drawbacks : absence of raw materials that have to be imported and the island &apos;s geographical isolation , far from its main markets , resulting in high delivery costs .
