this week &apos;s low wage and inflation results have convinced many analysts there will be a cut to official interest rates later this morning . 
in what would be the fifth easing within a year , many economists predict a cut of half-a-percentage point , as the Reserve Bank acts to stimulate the economy to create jobs . 
reserve Bank Governor Ian Macfarlane is in Shanghai , but colonial State Bank chief economist Hans Kunnen said that does not lessen the chances of a big announcement at 9.30 a.m. 
&quot; We live in the 1990s , there are fax machines , there are Internet things , these things can be done , but it really all depends what decisions were taken at the previous Reserve Bank board meeting , &quot; Mr Kunnen said . 
&quot; They may already have decided to do something provided the wage and inflation numbers were good , and they both have been very good numbers . 
analysts believe any fears the Reserve Bank may have had about too much economic growth pushing up inflation are now allayed , and if it does not lower rates today , it will after the next Reserve Bank board meeting on August 5 . 
Mr Kunnen said the rate cut may even be three-quarters of one per cent . 
unions claim the latest wages figure show that low-paid workers should have been granted more in their Living Wage case . 
figures show wages grew only 3.7 percent over the past year , well below the expectations of markets and the Reserve Bank . 
ACTU President Jennie George claims the Industrial Relations Commission could have provided a larger increase without affecting the economy . 
in April , the IRC granted the lowest paid an increase of $ 10 a week . 
the ACTU had asked for more , including a $ 20 a week safety-net increase for low paid people . 
Ms George said another pay rise to low paid workers would actually boost consumption in the economy . 
a Supreme Court hearing of a bail application for a man accused of throwing flammable liquid at a 10-year-old girl , will resume in Townsville this morning . 
the Court adjourned late yesterday to consider whether he should have psychiatric assessment . 
justice Kerry Cullinane requested the adjourment to enable council to draft possible orders about the psychiatric examination of the 52-year-old man as a condition of bail . 
the man is charged with grevious bodily harm and aggravated assault in relation to an incident which left Samantha Green with second and third degree burns . 
crown Prosecutor Michael Connolly said even if the man undergoes examination he should be placed in custody ; describing the attack as a serious offence that could not be put down to someone losing their temper . 
the accused &apos;s defence argued there was more to the case than had been revealed . 
police have located a third body at the scene of a fatal shooting near Moora , about 170 kilometres north of Perth . 
they say the body is that of a male in his early 20 &apos;s , but have not released any other details . 
yesterday , police located the bodies of a man and woman at a property , 27 kilometres south-west of Moora . 
a relative of the dead couple reported an incident at a farm property off Rowse Road , about one o &apos;clock . 
a search was started soon after for a man reported to be armed with a high-powered rifle . 
it is believed that the man police were searching for was the son of the dead couple . 
Federal Opposition leader Kim Beazley says British ministers have questioned him about the state of the race debate in Australia . 
Mr Beazley is in London for talks with the new Labour government of Prime Minister Tony Blair . 
he mentioned the race debate in a speech to an Australian Studies centre in London , saying Pauline Hanson and her supporters were an image problem Australia could control . 
Mr Beazley said the Hanson phenomemon has been raised by political leaders and business figures he &apos;s been meeting . 
&quot; Of course it resonates much more in the Asia / Pacific region than it does here in the UK . 
but certainly it &apos;s raised as an issue , and I think it merely makes it that much more important for those of us in political life in Australia to confront it &quot; , Mr Beazley said . 
BHP says it is spending $ 1 billion on capital investments , mostly at Port Kembla , to ensure there is a future for the steel industry in Australia . 
the comments come as the BHP Board meets at Port Kembla . 
BHP &apos;s Managing Director , John Prescott says the commitment to the industry comes despite there having been no growth in the domestic steel market in 20 years . 
Mr Prescott says the decision is being taken for the future . 
he says the company operates in an industry which has stiff world competition , and has virtually no tariff protection in Australia . 
he says the Port Kembla plant is as big as it is because the company exports 40 percent of what it makes . 
but the Australian Workers Union says it can not accept BHP &apos;s claims that it is not walking away from its involvment in the Australian steel industry . 
Newcastle union organiser , Kevin Maher , says BHP is pouring money into developing new steelmaking technology overseas , while retaining old technology at its Port Kembla steelmaking plant . 
the AFL should know today whether it has successfully appealed against the Supreme Court &apos;s ruling in the Greg Williams case . 
the AFL Tribunal suspended Williams for nine matches for unduly interfering with an umpire , after Carlton &apos;s Round One match against Essendon . 
but Carlton had the suspension quashed , with Supreme Court Justice Heddigan ruling Williams had been denied natural justice . 
the AFL appealed , arguing the ruling had significant implications for its judicial system . 
the Appeal Court is scheduled to deliver its judgement this morning .
