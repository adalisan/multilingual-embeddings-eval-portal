Britain &apos;s financial markets will get a valuable insight into domestic demand and the state of the public finances this week , but providing both are in line with expectations , the market could edge up and outperform . 
&quot; The momentum of domestic demand , which will be revealed in January retail sales figures , will be instrumental for gilts , &quot; said Philip Shaw , group economist at Union plc . 
the data are due on Wednesday and forecast to show a 0.2 percent rise on the month compared with December &apos;s surprise 0.8 percent fall . 
but the year-on-year rate of growth will rise to 3.8 percent compared with 2.9 percent in December . 
Kevin Adams , gilts analyst at BZW , agreed retail sales are the key data of the week . 
if the data show activity has failed to recover from December &apos;s dip , it will force a rethink of the economic outlook for this year , he said . 
&quot; The market will be looking for a bounce after December . 
if it doesn &apos;t get it , it will begin to question the assertion that growth will remain robust this year , &quot; he said . 
the figures will be studied by Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George who are at loggerheads over the need for an interest rate rise . 
Clarke , who wants rates to stay on hold at 6.0 percent , said last week there was no evidence the economy was recovering fast . 
but the Bank , which wants a quarter point rate rise , believes there is considerable risk demand will accelerate later this year . 
PSBR data on Tuesday will also offer the market information on the state of the public finances in January , a crucial tax gathering month . 
the Reuters consensus forecast suggested the data , due at 0930 GMT on Tuesday , will show a surplus of 3.5 billion sterling in January , versus a 2.1 billion deficit in December . 
and M4 data due on Thursday are likely to show broad money growth eased in the year to January to 9.1 percent from 9.5 percent in the year to December . 
&quot; As long as the numbers are not too troublesome there is a good chance gilts will outperform Bunds , &quot; said Adams . 
&quot; There seems to be a reasonable tone to the market overall with both domestic and international investors looking on it kindly . 
the spread between gilts and Bunds edged out to 176 basis points on Monday from 173 on Friday . 
however , the Bank &apos;s announcement on Tuesday of terms for next week &apos;s long-dated gilt auction could complicate matters . 
the Bank will auction gilts with a maturity of 2021 or beyond on February 25 . 
while some traders hope for a new 30-year gilt , most think the Bank will go for a more cautious new tranche of existing 8.0 percent gilts due 2021 . 
&quot; I think there is a small chance the Bank will go for a new 30-year gilt , but whatever it does it means long-dated yields will edge up , &quot; said one trader . 
but despite uncertainty over the auction , some analysts like the look of the ultra long end of the curve . 
&quot; The long end of the curve has now reached some attractive spread levels and , despite the auction details , we like the idea of a flattening medium term , &quot; said Tom Rayner , analyst at Societe Generale . 
&quot; This is based on the inflation outlook which should soon improve and result in lower forecasts for 1997 . 
at the short end , analysts said there is little opportunity for value at the very short end which is pricing in a very optimistic picture on interest rates . 
&quot; The short end is factoring in rates peaking at seven percent , and while that might be right , it still means little or no risk premium , &quot; said Adams .
