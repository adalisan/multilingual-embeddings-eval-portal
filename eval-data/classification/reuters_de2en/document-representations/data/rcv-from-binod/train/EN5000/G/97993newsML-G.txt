John Collins scored his first international goal for almost 18 months to help Scotland to a 2-0 World Cup victory over Latvia on Saturday . 
the Monaco midfielder gave his side the lead in the 18th minute . 
Stuart McCall touched a free kick short to Collins and he drove home a left-foot shot from just outside the penalty box . 
the goal was Collins &apos; ninth for his country , but his first since he scored against San Marino last year . 
Hibernian striker Darren Jackson sealed an important European group four win for the Scots with a second goal in the 77th minute . 
he curled a right-foot shot beyond diving Latvian goalkeeper Oleg Karavajev for his first international goal . 
Scotland , missing several key players because of injury , were indebted to goalkeeper Andy Goram for several fine saves as they battled to preserve their slender lead for much of the second half . 
Goram was forced into a spectacular save in the 74th minute from a ferocious 30-metre shot by centre-back Mikhail Zemlinksi .
