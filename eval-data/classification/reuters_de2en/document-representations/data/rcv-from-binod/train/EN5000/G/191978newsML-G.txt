hundreds of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees trudged back through light rain on Friday to the land they fled in panic after the genocide against Tutsis in 1994 . 
as night fell , a human tide of refugees moved slowly through the east Zairean town of Goma in the direction of the Rwandan border a few kilometres ( miles ) away . 
&quot; We &apos;ve got at least 250,000 on the move and there are another 500,000 out there , &quot; said Stefano Severe , head of the U.N. refugee agency in Goma . 
a Reuter correspondent reported the refugees were moving past the once-teeming Mugunga camp at the rate of 30,000 an hour and were backed up westwards along the road as far as 20 km ( 12 miles ) . 
Mugunga camp , a major base for Hutu militia and former Hutu government troops as well as refugees since the 1994 exodus into Zaire , was deserted -- burnt , looted and ransacked . 
Hutu fighters , blamed for the genocide of some 800,000 Rwandans , mostly minority Tutsis , were reported to have fled into the bush , having lost their two-year bid to stop ordinary refugees leaving the sprawling camps . 
the exodus followed six hours of fierce bombardment of Mugunga by a coalition of Zairean rebels , including ethnic Tutsis , on Thursday . 
the rebels have seized a strip of Zaire along its eastern border in a month of fighting against Rwandan Hutus and the Zairean army and militia . 
&quot; We left Mugunga an empty camp , we all fled because of the fighting yesterday , &quot; said refugee Vincent Nzehsi . 
there are no militia in the camp , they are all in the forest , &quot; he explained . 
&quot; The impasse has been broken . 
people are moving in the right direction ... There could be up to the total population of the camps moving towards Rwanda , &quot; Ray Wilkinson of the U.N. refugee agency told Reuters at Mugunga camp . 
the mass movement took place as the U.N. Security Council prepared to vote on a resolution to send a multinational force to ease the plight of an estimated 1.2 million Hutu refugees from Rwanda and Burundi scattered across eastern Zaire . 
it was good news for the international community which , wary of the hazards posed in the lawless region , had warned it would not take on the armed Hutus -- members of Rwanda &apos;s defeated ex-army and the dreaded Interahamwe militia . 
the U.N. &apos; s World Food Programme , waiting on the Rwandan side of the border with food previously used to tempt the refugees back , said up to 10,000 had already crossed with a further 275,000 backed up along the road . 
Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu , himself a Hutu , went to the Gisenyi border post to welcome his fellow countrymen . 
he received a tumultuous reception from the refugees . 
Rwanda &apos;s 54,000-strong army is dominated by Tutsis who swept the then Hutu-led government from power in 1994 after the genocide . 
many Hutu refugees had been too terrified to return to Rwanda -- despite U.N. encouragement -- because of intimidation by Hutu militia and out of fear of reprisals by Tutsis . 
a spokesman said aid organisations had not yet decided whether or not to shelter the returnees in temporary transit sites or return them directly to their home districts . 
in Washington , the White House welcomed the return but said it was still pressing on with arrangements for possible participation in an international rescue force . 
&quot; The situation is still very complicated and our assessment continues , &quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters . 
&quot; We are seeking assurances that the environment there would not present hostilities to any potential multinational force . 
the United Nations said it was delighted the refugees were heading home from eastern Zaire , but said a multinational force was still badly needed to help provide aid and logistics . 
&quot; Everybody is absolutely elated , but we still desperately need the multinational force , &quot; U.N. spokesman Sylvana FOA told Reuters at U.N. headquarters in New York . 
the rebels , openly supported by Rwanda , began shelling a few hours after confirmation an international force would soon be sent with no mandate to disarm the Hutu fighters . 
Rwanda and aid organisations had warned failure to tackle Hutu thugs would risk a re-run of 1994 when they were effectively saved by an international intervention which froze the military situation on the ground . 
the Hutu presence has also destabilised eastern Zaire and was a major factor in the rebellion led by Zairean Tutsis against the Zairean army one month ago . 
underlining the volatile nature of the region , home to a complex set of inter-related political and ethnic conflicts , Zaire said it would wage war on Burundi and Rwanda which it accuses of violating its territory in fighting in its east . 
&quot; We are determined to wage a total war ... We have the means , &quot; Zairean Deputy Foreign Minister Lokondo Yoka told a news conference in Brussels .
