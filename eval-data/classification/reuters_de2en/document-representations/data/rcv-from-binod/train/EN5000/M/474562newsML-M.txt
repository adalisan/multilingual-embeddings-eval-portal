shares on the Cyprus bourse jumped 3.02 percent during the week , mainly inspired by buying in the banking sector , especially of Hellenic Bank HBCP.CY , traders said . 
&quot; The upsurge in the volume was definitely related to the Hellenic Bank shares , &quot; said Christodoulos Ellinas of Share Link . 
Hellenic fully paid shares closed at 293.5 on Friday , up 2.5 percent from last week &apos;s close of 286.5 . 
newspapers have speculated that local businessman Nicos Shakolas , who chairs a number of companies on the 41-share bourse , is trying to increase his stake in the bank to five percent . 
the Shakolas Group has not commented on the speculation , fuelled by news of an off-the-floor purchase of 220,000 Hellenic shares by Interamerican Insurance , which is controlled by the group . 
the Cyprus Stock Exchange ( CSE ) index closed at 81.03 on Friday from 78.65 last week , with gains recorded in all seven sub indices . 
the bank index , the strongest on the bourse , closed with gains of 3.65 percent , approved investment firms with gains of 6.9 percent and insurance companies gains of 3 percent . 
the temporary suspension of trade in cement industries Vassiliko cement and the Cyprus cement Company was still in force by the CSE board of directors on Friday . 
the CSE temporarily suspended trading in shares of the two companies on March 11 amid unconfirmed reports Cyprus cement was making a bid for the full or partial takeover of Vassiliko . 
bourse sources told Reuters the suspension would probably be lifted by the middle of next week following the approval by parliament of a mergers and acquisition bill last Thursday . 
the bill guarantees equal treatment of shareholders in bid situations , with offers being made to all shareholders on a pro-rata basis .
