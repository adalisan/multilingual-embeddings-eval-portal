the Zimbabwe dollar was quoted firmer on the U.S. dollar and the rand but was easier against European currencies at the close of Wednesday &apos;s lacklustre interbank session , dealers said . 
they added that trade was largely directed by overseas market trends . 
&quot; Nothing much happened today . 
it was a very quiet ( local ) market , &quot; commented one dealer . 
the unit finished the day at 10.5850 / 6050 against the U.S. dollar , up from Tuesday &apos;s 10.5900 / 6100 , but tumbled to 17.2700 / 3400 from 17.0220 / 0650 against pound sterling , tracking a weaker U.S. dollar on the British currency abroad . 
it was also easier on the German mark at 7.0500 / 0700 compared to 7.0090 / 0270 while against South Africa &apos;s troubled rand it firmed to 2.2300 / 2400 from 2.2570 / 2640 .
