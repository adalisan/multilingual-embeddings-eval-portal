the Helsinki Stock Exchange is not not interested in joining the cooperation between the Stockholm and Copenhagen bourses announced on Thursday , the daily Helsingin Sanomat reported on Friday . 
the bourse had earlier said cooperation would be difficult , and although European cooperation models are still open , it may find opportunities there , especially if Finland joins EMU . 
&quot; It would be awkward if we were to tie our hands to cooperating only with Stockholm and Copenhagen , &quot; Helsingin Sanomat quoted bourse managing director Juhani Erma as saying .
