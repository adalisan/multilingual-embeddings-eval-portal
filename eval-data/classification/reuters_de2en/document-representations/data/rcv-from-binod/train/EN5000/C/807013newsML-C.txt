Swiss private banking group Julius Baer Holding said on Monday it expected an &quot; above-average result &quot; for 1997 after first-half business boomed in flourishing world financial markets . 
Baer , one of the few specialist fund management groups in Europe which is listed , said six-month net profit after minorities jumped 62 percent to 107.5 million Swiss francs ( $ 71.5 million ) while assets under management rose 39 percent to 78.3 billion Swiss francs . 
&quot; Based on our current perspective , we therefore anticipate an above-average result and significant growth of consolidated profit in 1997 , &quot; the parent company of Zurich-based Bank Julius Baer said in a statement . 
&quot; We have expanded the assets under management disproportionately in the past six to 12 months -- also substantially in excess of our long-term plan -- which provides a very robust basis for future business . 
Baer also said it had gradually repurchased 30,000 of its own shares from the market in order to service a 1.5 percent convertible 1993-1998 bond , which will require 65,000 bearer shares altogether . 
&quot; The possibility of repurchasing additional shares depends on market developments , &quot; Baer said . 
half-year profits were boosted by a 63 percent jump in trading income to 129 million Swiss francs and 45 percent higher commission and fees income of 216.2 million . 
new client business accounted for around five billion Swiss francs of the increase in assets which also benefited from the strong equities markets and a lower Swiss franc , the company said . 
private clients continued to represent about 70 percent of asset volume . 
investment funds accounted for about 12 percent or nine billion Swiss francs of total assets under management , with new fund business coming especially from Germany and Italy . 
analysts praised the results , which follow a bumper crop of first-half net profit reports from Switzerland &apos;s Big Three universal banks . 
&quot; This is a clearly positive result , &quot; Zurich Kantonalbank said in a daily market report . 
&quot; The important areas of commission and service fees as well as trading results were convincing , &quot; it added . 
operating costs rose by 28 percent to 244 million Swiss francs , but the cost / income ration improved to 61 percent from 68 percent a year earlier due to the stronger rate of income growth .
