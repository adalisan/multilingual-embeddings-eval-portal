new Zealand &apos;s yield curve inverted further on Monday and monetary conditions eased to levels considered provocative to the Reserve Bank . 
however , the RB may be reluctant to act ahead of inflation data on Tuesday where the market believes quarterly inflation below the RB &apos;s 0.3 percent could justify its push to ease conditions beyond the bank &apos;s desired level . 
simultaneously , the New Zealand dollar has been losing ground in sympathy with the Australian dollar and a further dumping of the Australasians overnight could push the Monetary Conditions Index into a precarious position . 
it closed 66 points easier than the RB &apos;s desired level -- about the same level that caused the RB on Friday to state that conditions were too easy . 
&quot; If the Aussie gets dumped overnight and the kiwi goes with them then we could be in serious trouble , &quot; said one senior dealer . 
longer bond yields fell in sympathy with the U.S. and Australian markets . 
bills were stuck with sellers reluctant above the psychological 7.5 percent but buyers scarce because of the easiness of the MCI . 
the market is mainly nervous about the inflation data . 
while economists have had a track record of accurately predicting the figure , this quarter dealers are more than usually nervous about the prospect of a rogue number . 
economists on average forecast the June quarter CPI would rise 0.14 percent which would see core inflation rise 0.33 percent for an annual rate of 1.5 percent . 
if the quarterly underlying inflation rise is 0.2 percent , the market may be prepared to test the RB and at 0.1 percent the bills would definitely rally . 
&quot; I don &apos;t know how the bank would wear that , &quot; said one senior dealer , who added that a figure of 0.4 percent or 0.5 percent would spark a very rapid sell-off in anticipation of intervention by the bank .
