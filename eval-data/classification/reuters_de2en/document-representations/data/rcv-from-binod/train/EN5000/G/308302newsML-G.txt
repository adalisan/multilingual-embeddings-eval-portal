President Boris Yeltsin is recovering from a serious bout of pneumonia but must stay in hospital for the rest of the week because of the risk of complications , the chief Kremlin doctor said on Wednesday . 
&quot; I should say that this is a fairly serious illness , which of course brings with it a whole range of possible complications , &quot; said Sergei Mironov , who said last Friday that Yeltsin would leave hospital early this week . 
he told a news conference that Yeltsin &apos;s condition had &quot; stabilised considerably &quot; but the 65-year-old president , who had initially insisted on only three days in hospital , had been persuaded that he needed more time to be treated in hospital . 
Mironov singled out a visit to the Banya , the traditional steam bath which Yeltsin loves , as the cause of the pneumonia . 
as Mironov gave his latest update , Yeltsin &apos;s political foes were stepping up efforts to oust him on health grounds . 
the opposition communists , still his main sparring partners five years after the Soviet Union broke up , said Yeltsin was unable to exercise power and the country was in deep crisis . 
Communist deputy Viktor Ilyukhin , who heads the Duma &apos;s security committee , said he would press for a parliamentary vote on Friday to oust Yeltsin for health reasons , even though legal experts said such a vote would have no legal force . 
&quot; We deputies cannot ignore the public &apos;s worry , &quot; Gennady Seleznyov , the communist chairman of the opposition-dominated lower house of parliament , said at the start of a new parliamentary session . 
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said his party , the biggest in the lower house , would decide on Thursday whether to support moves to force Yeltsin from office . 
&quot; The president last year worked four months -- only during the election campaign -- and on the whole he didn &apos;t focus on government affairs but on promises , &quot; Zyuganov , who lost to Yeltsin in last July &apos;s presidential election , told reporters . 
&quot; For any citizen of the country it raises the question : &apos; Why isn &apos;t there any leadership in the country ? 
the Russian constitution is vague on removing an ailing head of state , saying only that the president &quot; ceases his functions &quot; if his health is too weak to remain in office . 
it does not specify who decides on a move which such far-reaching implications . 
Yeltsin , who turns 66 on February 1 , has been in Moscow &apos;s elite Central Clinical Hospital since January 8 with pneumonia of both lungs . 
doctors on Tuesday issued the first report of substantial progress in tackling the pneumonia , which Yeltsin suffered just two months after he had heart surgery . 
Mironov dismissed the talk of removing Yeltsin from office , saying he had only been in hospital for a week . 
&quot; His condition has stabilised to a significant extent in the last three days . 
his temperature has already been showing normal readings for almost six days , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I think that he should stay in the Central Clinical Hospital ... until the end of this week . 
beyond that it will depend on the course of his illness . 
he said daily doctors &apos; meetings to discuss Yeltsin &apos;s health would continue although he was no longer restricted to bed even as doctors were trying to limit his workload . 
&quot; Sometimes he gets up at 3.30 , 4 o &apos;clock and works on documents and then three hours later he might sleep for another hour and a half , &quot; Mironov said . 
&quot; Of course we try to limit his workload because the illness he now has is quite treacherous . 
Mironov said they were still counting on Yeltsin being able to attend a summit of leaders of 12 former Soviet states in Moscow towards the end of January . 
the pneumonia is the latest health problem for Yeltsin , who had a heart bypass on November 5 and was away from the Kremlin for most of the time from the end of June until December 23 . 
it has renewed discussion of his ability to rule the 150 million-strong Russian population and raised the issue of whether an election might be called ahead of schedule . 
the next election is due in the year 2000 .
