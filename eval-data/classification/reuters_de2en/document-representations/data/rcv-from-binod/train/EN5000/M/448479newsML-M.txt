the ringgit was rangebound in late Asian trading for lack of any fresh trading factors , dealers said on Monday . 
they said there was little activity in the afternoon after the minor transactions in the morning , which were mainly for corporate customers . 
&quot; Dollar / ringgit is very very quiet today because there is no factor to trade on , &quot; said a U.S bank dealer in Singapore . 
he said the market still favoured the ringgit though in the near-term a strong dollar was keeping it subdued . 
&quot; There was some ( dollar ) selling interest around 2.4770 level , but around 2.4760 some commercial demand from KL stopped the movement , &quot; said the head of dealing at a Malaysian bank . 
he said activity was mainly driven by commercial demand and interbank players were quiet . 
there was also little activity in ringgit / Singapore dollar , though some profit-taking was expected soon , dealers said . 
&quot; The ringgit is still looking to strengthen in the medium and long-term , &quot; said a dealer with another Malaysian bank .
