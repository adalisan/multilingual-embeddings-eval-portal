Fourty-five expatriot aid workers were stranded in danger in the eastern Zairean town of Uvira on Monday after attempts to evacuate them failed , a senior aid official said . 
the aid workers were spending the night at United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees &apos; ( UNHCR ) premises after an evacuation flight was cancelled and plans to drive in convoy to the Burundian capital were halted . 
&quot; Right now we have 45 expatriots stuck in an extremely dangerous situation . 
they are going to spend the night in UNHCR offices , &quot; a senior aid official in Bujumbura told Reuters . 
&quot; To say the least they are very demoralised because their hopes were raised when they thought they were getting out , &quot; the official added . 
the expatriots spent the afternoon waiting for the arrival of an evacuation flight from Bukavu and were forced to cancel a plan to drive to Bujumbura at around 5.30 pm ( 1530 GMT ) , having received border clearance from Burundian authorities . 
renewed attempts to evacuate the group would be made on Tuesday , a western diplomat said . 
in Rome , the U.N. World Food Programme said that it would try to evacuate U.N. personnel and staff of non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) from eastern Zaire on Tuesday . 
it said this followed a last-minute decision by Zairean authorities to allow a WFP-chartered plane to fly into Uvira . 
the WFP estimated that between 44 and 54 U.N. and other aid workers were in the region , including two of its own staff . 
almost all of Uvira &apos;s foreign community is being temporarily evacuated because of heavy fighting between Zairean authorities and ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels . 
more than 200,000 Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees are heading north towards Bukavu after fleeing a string of camps north of Uvira as a result of the fighting . 
&quot; There is a temporary suspension of activities in Uvira because of heavy fighting but when the fighting stops some of them will go back , &quot; the aid worker said on condition his organisation was not named . 
aid agencies are planning a renewed effort to help the refugees and Banyamulenge displaced by the fighting and efforts by Zairean authorities to clear them from a plateau north west of Lake Tanganyika .
