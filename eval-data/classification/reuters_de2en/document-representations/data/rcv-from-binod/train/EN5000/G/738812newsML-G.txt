some 600 Albanians deported from Greece complained on Friday they were robbed by armed gangs as soon as they crossed the border into an area no longer patrolled by troops of a European security force . 
Albanian border police chief Abedin Hitaj said 13 busloads of Albanians had crossed from Greece in the last two days . 
&quot; That is the greatest influx of migrants to be returned by force in the last four-five months , &quot; said Hitaj , adding that the deportees said they were rounded up from their homes or workplaces mainly in Athens and the city of Patra . 
violence which flared in Albania after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes early this year has continued despite a June 29 election . 
the state exercises little or no authority in many regions over gunmen armed with looted weapons . 
some 390 Romanian troops of the Multinational Protection Force left Gjirokaster on Wednesday for Durres port , from where they are due to leave for home by ship on Saturday . 
local people complained they had done little besides accompanying international monitors during the election . 
deportees were obliged to walk the 28 km ( 15 miles ) from the Kakavie border point to Gjirokaster , the nearest town . 
buses and taxis refuse to operate because of the armed gangs . 
&quot; As if our detention and loss of money in Greece were not enough , we were were robbed three times by armed masked men on our land , &quot; said Fadil Luto , 48 , from the southern district of Mallakaster . 
scores of deportees passed the night in private companies &apos; compounds protected by local armed guards . 
a large ethnic Greek minority , estimated at 60,000 to 120,000 people , lives in southern Albania , while an estimated 350,000 Albanian immigrants , most of them illegally crossing the border , live in neighbouring Greece . 
after four years of tension Tirana and Athens settled most of their grievances , signing a friendship treaty and an accord to legalise the status of Albanian immigrants in Greece in March and May of last year . 
force spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Giovanni Bernardi said 260 Italians of the 151st infantry regiment would return home by ship from Vlore on Sunday . 
he said the first 340 Spanish troops would leave on July 22 and 23 by ship from Durres . 
&quot; The last contingent will leave Albania on August 11 from Rinas airport and Durres port , &quot; Bernardi told Reuters . 
some 7,000 troops were deployed across Albania in April in Operation Alba to protect aid deliveries and ensure elections ran smoothly . 
a senior politician of the leftist coalition which will form the next government has told diplomats he would have liked the force to stay until the end of the year , to give the new government time to reorganise the national army and police . 
&quot; As far as I know almost all Albanians would like the force to stay longer but we have accomplished our mission , &quot; Bernardi said . 
diplomats say there is talk of bilateral Italian or Greek security arrangements once the new government is formed .
