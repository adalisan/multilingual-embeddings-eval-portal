Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin inspected Russia &apos;s nuclear strike force on Friday and , as the U.S. Secretary of State held talks in Moscow , the Kremlin number two declared the atomic arsenal was still in working order . 
there was no indication that the timing of the visit to the strategic command headquarters at Odintsovo outside Moscow was anything other than coincidence . 
Chernomyrdin had met the new U.S. Secretary of State , Madeleine Albright , on Thursday . 
but the significance of his remarks could scarcely go unnoticed as Albright met President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin and tried to persuade the Russian establishment and people that NATO &apos;s plans to expand into eastern Europe posed no threat . 
&quot; Everything is in the highest state of readiness , &quot; Chernomyrdin , filmed by Russian television , said during his tour of the bunkers . 
&quot; Everything is working as it should do . 
Itar-Tass news agency later quoted a military source as saying the premier told senior officers that recent test firings showed that Russia &apos;s nuclear arsenal was reliable . 
Chernomyrdin told his audience : &quot; To not take account of this factor when making vital military-political decisions on a pan- European or global scale would be short-sighted and premature . 
Yeltsin had ordered Chernomyrdin to inspect the missile forces , the backbone of Russia &apos;s nuclear strike power , after Defence Minister Igor Rodionov complained last week that they were close to collapse because of poor funding . 
Rodionov later said he had not meant there was any immediate threat of the nuclear forces going out of control . 
Chernomyrdin said on Friday there were problems that needed sorting out , but did not specify them . 
&quot; There are problems , serious problems . 
but they are soluble problems and the will be solved , &quot; he said . 
the government wanted more information about the real situation in the missile forces . 
there have been reports of poor morale , maintenance difficulties and other problems -- all of which have caused concern in the West . 
Chernomyrdin said the government considered it a priority to provide funding and other necessary conditions for maintaining the high readiness of the missile forces . 
Russian leaders have said they will consider taking &quot; adequate measures &quot; if NATO goes ahead with plans to expand eastwards and they are worried that new members in eastern Europe could have nuclear weapons based on their territory . 
Rodionov has said that under certain circumstances , Moscow &apos;s missiles might be pointed westwards , although other Russian leaders have played down his suggestion . 
security Council secretary Ivan Rybkin said last week Moscow could , in some circumstances , launch a nuclear strike against a conventional aggressor , though the Kremlin played down the idea . 
as part of its efforts to reassure Moscow that NATO enlargement poses no threat , the Western alliance says it sees no reason to base nuclear weapons on the soil of new members . 
Albright said on Friday : &quot; We are no longer in a situation of you versus us . 
we are all on the same side . 
but much complex work remained to be done , she said .
