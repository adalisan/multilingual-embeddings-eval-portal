the Brussels bourse held up well on Thursday despite Wall Street &apos;s move lower and traders said a downwards correction was now long overdue but was still proving highly elusive . 
&quot; The strength of Brussels is remarkable . 
this market needs a correction but nobody wants to sell , &quot; one trader said . 
the Bel-20 share index ended a moderately active day 1.12 points up at 2,146.55 having earlier hit a new year high of 2,154.14 . 
it has risen in almost a straight line from 1,871.05 on January 2 . 
steel cord and wire maker Bekaert , metals group Union Miniere and utility holding firm Tractebel were the stars on an otherwise featureless market . 
&quot; There was not that much going on this morning but then Bekaert , Union Miniere and Tractebel moved up and the rest of the index ( stocks ) followed , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; There was also some buying of the index itself , &quot; he added . 
Bekaert ended 1.4 percent higher at 21,300 francs , having at one stage hit 21,375 . 
traders said the stock went up on news earlier that the company was on the verge of a $ 95 million deal in Brazil . 
&quot; Bekaert has been concentrating on emerging markets and Brazil was a glaring hole in Latin America . 
now it can focus on synergies with its other operations in the region , &quot; one trader said . 
traders could give no single explanation for the Union Miniere strength , but they noted that the dollar was strong and zinc prices were high -- both of which were positive for the group , which is undergoing a restructuring . 
Tractebel ended 0.8 percent up at 15,125 francs , having earlier hit a year high of 15,300 francs . 
traders said the rise was due to a combination of a gas pipeline deal in Jordan the company announced after the market closed on Wednesday and a general feel-good factor about the firm . 
Generale Bank and BBL rose respectively 125 francs to 12,875 and 90 francs to 7,550 , but traders noted that the market in the stocks was not liquid .
