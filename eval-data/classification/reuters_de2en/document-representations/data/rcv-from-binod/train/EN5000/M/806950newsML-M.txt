Greek shares tracked the performance of major international bourses on Monday on the back of Wall Street &apos;s weak show on Friday , but strength in OTE telecom helped limit overall losses . 
&quot; Trading volume remains meagre amidst the peak of the summer holiday season and prices sway easily under the influence of external factors , &quot; said Athanasios Trikatzis , broker at Hermes brokerage . 
news of a 3.11 percent fall in Wall Street stocks on Friday , the combined result of concerns for a falling dollar and corporate profits , was closely monitored by local market participants and was cited as a reason for Monday &apos;s drift in the Athens bourse &apos;s benchmark index . 
nervousness in foreign equity markets took its toll on Greek stocks which remain directionless within a narrow trading range around 1,600 points , Trikatzis said . 
&quot; I think investors used the conditions in international markets as an excuse to take profits on a quiet 100-point rise of the benchmark index in recent days on practically no fresh news , &quot; said a fund manager who wished to keep his anonymity . 
the market remains vibrant and investor interest in equities is rather high , the fund manager added . 
the Athens benchmark index lost 1.39 percent or 22.91 points at 1,622.90 from Thursday &apos;s 1,638.47 close . 
all sector sub-indices settled lower . 
Industrials led the market with a 2.03 percent drop , with banks softening 1.54 percent . 
turnover reached 7.8 billion drachmas on volume of 1.8 million shares , including a block of 30,000 shares of Alpha Credit Bank traded at 20,000 drachmas . 
Decliners beat advancers 149 to 46 with 14 shares unchanged on 209 traded .
