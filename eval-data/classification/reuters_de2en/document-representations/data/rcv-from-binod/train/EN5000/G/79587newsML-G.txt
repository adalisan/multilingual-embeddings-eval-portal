&quot; Stop throwing stones . 
this will not help now , &quot; a Palestinian policeman shouted at demonstrators . 
but his words were followed by a hail of gunfire on Thursday as Palestinian and Israeli forces fought gunfights in Gaza reminiscent of militia battles in Beirut . 
the Palestinian Higher Security Council late on Wednesday said Palestinian President Yasser Arafat had ordered his security forces to defend their people . 
as the day wore on , the Palestinian death toll rose . 
while Palestinian police advanced on Israeli targets , demonstrators from Arafat &apos;s mainstream Fatah faction came out from behind cement blocks and hurled stones at Israelis . 
&quot; We are going to Jerusalem , &quot; the demonstrators chanted in a reference to the city sacred to Moslems and Jews and the issue at the centre of the violence that erupted on Wednesday . 
witnesses said about 200 Palestinian demonstrators pelted Israeli soldiers with stones near Netzarim Jewish settlement , and Israelis fired live ammunition , rubber bullets and teargas . 
Palestinian police fired back . 
groups of demonstrators then skirted the checkpoint and threw stones at the settlement from surrounding fields . 
Jews living in the fortified enclaves spoke of a war being waged on the doorsteps of their homes . 
there were similar scenes at nearby Kfar Darom settlement and at other Israeli sites . 
Members of three different Palestinian security forces , including Coast Guards in navy blue and green military uniforms , hid behind cement blocks and ambulances while firing at Israelis sheltering behind their military jeeps . 
a Palestinian youngster , joining the gunbattle near Netzarim , picked up the rifle that a Palestinian policeman dropped after being shot in the neck . 
the boy , who looked to be 12 to 14 years old , fired at Israeli soldiers until Palestinian policemen persuaded him to hand over the weapon .
