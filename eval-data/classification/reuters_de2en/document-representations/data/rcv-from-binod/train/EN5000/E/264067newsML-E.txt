China has reported a basically balanced budget for this year and will maintain its moderately tight fiscal policy next year , Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli said on Wednesday . 
State revenue increased by 18.1 percent in the first 11 months of the year , and China was expected to hold the state deficit within the targeted range for 1996 , the Xinhua news agency quoted Liu as telling a national conference on fiscal work . 
China &apos;s fiscal situation had entered a smooth period of development since the new fiscal and tax system was established three years ago , Liu said . 
official figures show state revenue has been growing by 90 billion yuan annually in the last four years . 
&quot; This fully demonstrated that China &apos;s reform in its fiscal and tax system is successful , &quot; Liu said . 
however , Liu warned of problems such as tax losses , unrestricted spending and fiscal disorder . 
&quot; wasteful activities and over-spending should be strictly stemmed all over the country to ensure a slower growth in expenditure than in revenue , and contain the state deficit within a reasonable range , &quot; Liu was quoted as saying .
