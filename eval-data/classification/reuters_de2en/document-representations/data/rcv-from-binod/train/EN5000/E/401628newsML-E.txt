the Indian government said on Wednesday that foreign direct investment ( FDI ) totalled $ 1.71 billion between April and December 1996 , up from $ 1.50 billion in the same period in 1995 . 
the government &apos;s annual Economic Survey said foreign portfolio investment totalled $ 2.343 billion in April-December 1996 , more than double the $ 1.121 billion in the same period in 1995 . 
fresh inflows of funds from foreign institutional investors ( FIIs ) totalled $ 1.511 billion in April-December 1996 , up from $ 1.002 billion in the corresponding period in 1995 . 
&quot; With the decline in share prcies in late 1996 , FII flows may accelerate further to reap the benefits of &apos; bottom fishing &apos; , but some uncertainty remains , &quot; the survey said . 
the report said foreign exchange reserves , compriising foreign currency assets , gold and Special Drawing Rights ( SDRs ) , rose to $ 24.0 billion at the end of January 1997 from $ 21.6 billion at the end of May 1996 . 
foreign currency assets stood at $ 19.8 billion on January 31 , 1997 , the equivalent of 5.5 months of imports of goods . 
the survey said : &quot; Although the current level of reserves is comfortable , there is a need for a further build-up in reserves to have greater flexibility in exchange rate management , to absorb any unanticipated external shocks , to facilitate India &apos;s move towards full capital account convertibility and to impart confidence in the international investor community about the soundness of India &apos;s balance of payments .
