NYCE December cotton fell to a contract low but rebounded slightly by the close , as players anticipated a bearish U.S. Department of Agriculture supply and demand report , market sources said . 
&quot; The numbers are telling us that there is too much supply chasing too little demand , &quot; said David Brandon Jr , a senior analyst with Smith Barney . 
December cotton settled 0.59 cent weaker at 70.72 cents per pound , traded 71.10 to 70.35 , a contract low . 
the back months finished down 0.63 to 0.05 . 
volume was estimated at 12,000 lots . 
industry sources peg the U.S. production estimate between 18.4 million and 18.58 million 480-lb bales , compared with 18.159 bales last month . 
substantial increases in the crop are likely to show up in Texas , the Delta , and the Southeast , they said . 
industry sources also expect the USDA to boost its estimates for Australia and West Africa , and cut forecasts for Brazil , Pakistan and CIS . 
Brandon said the estimate for ending stocks will be a key number in tomorrow &apos;s report . 
with output up and consumption flat , the USDA could raise its estimate to around 5.0 million bales from its October forecast of 4.5 million bales . 
&quot; If we add a couple of million bales to U.S. carryover it will dampen prices and discourage farmers , &quot; Brandon said .
