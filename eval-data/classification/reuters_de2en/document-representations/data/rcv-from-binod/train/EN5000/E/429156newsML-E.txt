the median forecast of economists is for year average growth of 3.0 percent , and they said the lower growth result may have some impact on the budget bottom line . 
with unemployment still seen fairly high by mid year , tax receipts should be lower than expected and welfare payments will probably be higher than expected . 
while the government stood by its 1996 / 97 forecast this week , economists said that as the 1997 / 98 budget is due in May , the government may still revise the growth forecast before year end . 
against the expectations of lower growth in the current financial year , economists see growth in 1997 / 98 economists as being stronger than expected

with revised data showing the pace of growth slightly slower than originally reported last week , economists said employment should post its fifth consecutive rise , in line with expectations of a strengthening economy . 
one of the most watched 
indicators in the second half of the year , the expectation of the labour force statistics has lessened given the less likelihood of another rate cut in the past month . 
however , economists did say that after the growth of the December quarter the risks to employment growth are probably to the downside . 
economists said they were looking for a continuation of the recent trend away from refinancing and into new construction as the housing sector starts to recover from 
its two year slump . 
the preconditions for sustained recovery from the slump since mid-1994 have been set in place , and economists are now looking for a run of positive housing finance numbers as the housing upswing gathers pace .
