Mexico &apos;s international reserves fell sharply to $ 21.258 billion as of June 20 , compared to $ 22.391 billion on June 13 . 
the central bank said that its net international assets as of the same date also fell to $ 13.602 billion from $ 15.170 billion the week before . 
Banco de Mexico said in a statement that it had changed its methodology for measuring net international assets , which are defined as gross international assets minus central bank liabilities with the IMF and assets of less than a six-month duration from other central banks . 
it said it has decided to measure assets through a more precise method of calculating the value of IMF liabilities and gold reserves that has been used in previous months as part of the net international reserves calcuation . 
&quot; Because this method of valuation is more precise , the central bank has decided to apply it to net international assets as well as reserves , &quot; the Banco de Mexico said . 
it said the change in methodology resulted in a $ 421 million increase in assets from one week to the next . 
net international assets on June 13 would have been $ 15.603 billion using the new methodology , it said . 
the central bank also said the level of international reserves and assets were affected by the creation of a separate dollar fund to house monies to be used in the previously announced prepayment by Mexico of some $ 6 billion in 2001 notes . 
the payment will be made on August 6 . 
the new fund held $ 3.046 billion as of June 20 , $ 2 billion of which were from international reserves , Banco de Mexico said . 
the central bank said the decrease of $ 1.567 billion in net international assets during the period was due to : 
--Federal government expenses worth $ 2.017 billion , explained above . 
--Payment to state oil and gas monopoly Pemex worth $ 9 million . 
--An increase of $ 421 million due to the new methodology in valuing gold and IMF liabilities , also explained above . 
--A net gain of $ 38 million for a combination of factors including changes in the dollar value of non-dollar assets and liabilities held by the bank ; net returns on interest rates and from trading of metals and securities ; and net deposits in dollar accounts from commercial banks at the central bank . 
Banco de Mexico said that between April 18 and April 25 the monetary base fell 2.518 billion pesos due to a fall in the seasonal demand of bills and coins . 
in the same period , the government &apos;s balance at the central bank fell by 181 million pesos , made up of the difference between an increase in government tax receipts held at the bank of 9.364 billion pesos and a decrease of 9.545 billion pesos used in the above-mentioned fund . 
the bank said it undertook monetary regulation operations for a total of 6.420 billion pesos in the same time frame to offset the increase in tax receipts .
