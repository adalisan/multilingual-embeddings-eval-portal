the Venezuelan Bolivar closed slightly firmer at 480.00 / 481.00 per dollar Tuesday compared to 480.75 / 481.75 per dollar Monday , as the Central Bank met demand for foreign currency and investors sought bolivars to buy short-term Bolivar denominated paper , traders said . 
&quot; There was demand for currency from big banks , but this did not affect the rate because , as well as participation by the Central Bank , there was some currency offer from brokerages seeking bolivars to buy TEM bills , &quot; one said . 
yields on six-month monetary stabilization , or TEM , bills rose 182 basis points to 18.71 percent at Tuesday &apos;s auction . 
demand for bolivars saw the inter-bank lending rate jump to around 25 percent at one point before settling back around 13 percent , another trader said . 
the rise in TEM yields -- which set the benchmark for wider interest rates -- should ease the pressure on the Bolivar in coming days , traders added .
