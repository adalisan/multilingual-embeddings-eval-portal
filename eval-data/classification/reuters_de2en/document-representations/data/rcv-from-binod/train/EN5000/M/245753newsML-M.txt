South African gold miners have not been pressured into heavy forward selling because a weak rand has given them breathing space , an official of Anglo American Corp of South African Ltd said on Tuesday . 
recent weakness in gold prices have been attributed , in part , to producer selling . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think there is a huge amount of ( South African ) forward selling at these levels , &quot; Clem Sunter , chairman of corporate affairs for Anglo American , told Reuters on the sidelines of an investment conference in London . 
Sunter , who until earlier this year was chairman of Anglo &apos;s gold and uranium division , declined to say whether Anglo itself had increased its hedging position recently . 
Anglo , the world &apos;s biggest gold producer , said in October that its gold hedging programme had earned it between 800 million and one billion rand over the past six years . 
but Sunter said the market effect of any additional forward selling would be largely offset by previous forward positions which are now coming to maturity . 
&quot; I personally doubt that the new hedging positions are larger than those positions coming to maturity , &quot; Sunter said . 
this year &apos;s weakness of the rand has lead to a steadily rising domestic gold price even as the dollar level has hit the lowest in over three years . 
some analysts believe South African producers may wish to lock in the strong rand price through forward selling and other hedging strategies . 
&quot; They don &apos;t have to ( hedge ) , the rand has taken the pressure off for the time being , &quot; Sunter said , adding that he was only referring to South Africa . 
the situation may be different in Australia and North America .
