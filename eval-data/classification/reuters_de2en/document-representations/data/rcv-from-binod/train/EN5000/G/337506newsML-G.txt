Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso &apos;s plan to run for a second term faces its initial big challenge on Tuesday night when the Chamber of Deputies votes for the first time on a constitutional amendment that would allow re-election . 
the amendment , if approved in Congress , would allow Cardoso a chance to become Brazil &apos;s first president to win a second consecutive term in office . 
fearful of a legacy of past imperial powers , Brazil has never allowed sitting presidents , governors or or mayors to seek to extend their time in office through re-election . 
Cardoso , midway through his four-year term , says his re-election would provide the political stability required to continue his economic reforms to streamline the state . 
below are a series of questions and answers which may help explain how Cardoso intends to guide his re-election dream through the shifting sands of Brazilian politics . 
the constitutional amendment allowing re-election is due to be put a first of two votes in the Chamber of Deputies , the lower house of Congress . 
it requires a three-fifths majority , equivalent to 308 votes , to approve the measure both times to be approved and advance to the Senate . 
to begin voting on a constitutional amendment , a minimum of 308 deputies must register their presence on the floor of the lower house . 
the Workers Party , the biggest opposition party , along with other left-wing parties and an anti-Cardoso faction of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party ( PMDB ) , the largest party in Congress , will refuse to register , forcing the government to get its supporters on to the floor en masse to begin proceedings . 
if the bill is approved , the lower house will then vote on a series of changes to its text proposed by the opposition , including clauses that would oblige the government to hold a referendum and a plebiscite on the issue . 
another proposed change would make holders of executive office , including the president , to step down for a determined period during re-election campaigns . 
the floor of the Chamber of Deputies is notoriously volatile , with over 15 different parties jostling for power or scheming to defeat the government . 
last year , the government suffered a major defeat there when deputies failed to give it the three-fifths majority it needed for pension reform . 
some of the proposals the government will have to defeat with a three-fifths majority , meaning it will have to make sure its supporters stay in the lower house after the initial vote . 
others changes require 308 opposition votes in favor for approval , a tall order . 
once given first approval in the lower house , the second vote is usually considered something of a formality . 
the government is worried , however , that the upcoming internal elections in Congress may upset its carefully constructed web of support for re-election . 
the Senate tends to be less of a headache for the government than the rowdy Chamber of Deputies because it only has 81 members , most of whom are generally Cardoso-allied . 
but fur will fly in the election for Senate president and there could be seething resentment afterwards . 
senators from PMDB , who insisted the party &apos;s deputies must wait for the outcome of the Senate presidency race before voting on re-election but were outmanoeuvered by the government , are reported to be furious . 
most observers say Cardoso would gain lots of clout over Congress if given the chance of a second term . 
in the short term , that would help speed up his civil service , pension and tax reforms which are stuck in Congress . 
in the long term , deputies could flock to his Brazilian Social Democratic Party at the expense of other parties , principally the PMDB . 
Cardoso &apos;s prestige would also be translated into more votes for the PSDB in the 1998 congressional elections . 
( ( --Brasilia newsroom , 5561 2230358 ) ) 
the second vote in the Chamber of Deputies is expected to take place around February 15 . 
technically , it could take place next week but Congress will be distracted by elections to choose the new presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate . 
the following week is Carnival when the last thing on peoples &apos; minds will be politics . 
it &apos;s not the end of Cardoso &apos;s re-election dream . 
the government can begin the process of approving the amendment all over again after February 15 , when a new , year-long session of Congress begins . 
to do that , however , the once-defeated bill will have to be put to a second vote before February 15 so it can be officially shelved and then resuscitated . 
but defeat today would take the wind out of Cardoso &apos;s sails and undermine his prestige in Congress .
