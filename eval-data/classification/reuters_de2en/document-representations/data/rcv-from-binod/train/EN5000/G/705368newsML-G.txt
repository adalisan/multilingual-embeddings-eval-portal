Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral &apos;s fractious party voted on Thursday to choose a leader in an election overshadowed by corruption allegations and the prospect of a bitter split in its ranks . 
leaders of the Janata Dal , the largest group in Gujral &apos;s 15-party United Front coalition , used the ballot box for the first time in the party &apos;s nine years to select their leader . 
but the dose of democracy , imposed by an activist Election Commission and supported by the Supreme Court , was obscured by the incumbent party leader &apos;s call to boycott the polls . 
Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav , who is chief minister of the populous eastern state of Bihar , said voter lists had been rigged against him . 
&quot; I will not allow anybody to capture the party through proxy and that is why I have given the call for boycott of the elections , &quot; Yadav said on Wednesday . 
Yadav &apos;s supporters in Bihar said they would hold their own convention on Saturday in the state capital Patna to re-elect him as leader of their faction . 
results of the balloting in the main faction were not expected before Sunday . 
Yadav and 55 others have been indicted by federal police in a $ 280-million corruption case involving the alleged embezzlement of state animal husbandry funds . 
last month , the case forced a junior minister to resign from Gujral &apos;s two-month-old government . 
but Yadav , who says he is innocent , has refused to step down either as chief minister or party leader . 
Gujral , who with other senior leaders has urged Yadav to quit , played down the split as he cast his vote at party headquarters in Delhi . 
&quot; There could be differences of opinion and perception , but we all belong to one party , &quot; he said . 
former prime minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda had veiled criticism for Yadav . 
&quot; Some of the senior leaders want to avoid the election and they tried their best , &quot; he said . 
newspapers underscored the tension that had built between Yadav and the main contender , Sharad Yadav , who is also from Bihar but no relative . 
&quot; Mr ( Laloo ) Yadav decided to complain against the constitution of the electoral college only after his efforts to have himself anointed as party chief failed , &quot; The Hindu newspaper said in an editorial . 
&quot; It is clear that the dispute that is being witnessed in the Janata Dal is merely a feud between two factions . 
Sharat Yadav said : &quot; If you wipe out all this dust that has gathered during the past nine years , there is bound to be some problem . 
Gujral has tried to keep above the fray for fear of being dragged into a fight that could weaken his grip on power . 
political analysts said Laloo Yadav was not expected to withdraw his crucial support to the centre-left alliance . 
but continued tension in the coalition &apos;s main party would doubtless complicate Gujral &apos;s task and could embolden its make-or-break ally , the Congress party .
