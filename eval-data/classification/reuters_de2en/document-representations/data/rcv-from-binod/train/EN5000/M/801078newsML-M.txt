aluminium prices are likely to probe downside support at $ 1,680 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) in the near-term , but that level is likely to hold , Japanese traders said on Thursday . 
&quot; During Asian hours , moderate technically driven buying was detected . 
aluminium prices may test $ 1680 , but I have a feeling that the downside would be solid partly on physical buying interest , &quot; a trader at a major trading house said . 
traders said that the market is still in a technical correction phase after prices became overextended on the upside . 
traders were also watching whether the increase in LME aluminium stocks in recent days suggests a change in inventory trends . 
one trader said some metal might have been attracted to warehouses by the backwardation , which , although softer on Wednesday on the LME , could blow out next week when August dates are traded . 
at 0632 GMT , benchmark three-month aluminium was quoted at $ 1,697 / $ 1,701 a tonne , marginally up from $ 1,696 at London &apos;s afternoon kerb close on Wednesday . 
copper prices were expected to drift within recent ranges for the near-term amid the summer lull .
