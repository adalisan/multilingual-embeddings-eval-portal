the national leader of Mexico &apos;s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( pri ) on Monday said he was confident that his party would remain the leading party in Congress after the July 6 mid-term elections . 
&quot; At this point it can be said categorically -- and I &apos;m quite aware of where I say it , how I say it and why I say it -- that a majority is practically guranteed , &quot; Humberto Roque Villanueva told reporters in this northern industrial city . 
Mexicans elect all 500 members of the lower house of Congress , one-fourth of the Senate , six state governors and a mayor for Mexico City in a race that political analysts and pollsters say will be a major test for the pri , which has ruled Mexico since 1929 . 
Roque said the pri is leader in polls in the six states that will elect a governo : Colima , San Luis Potosi , Queretaro , Sonora , Campeche and Nuevo Leoon .
