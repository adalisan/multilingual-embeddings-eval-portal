reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said on Thursday that a jump in money supply and private credit extension in January showed there was no scope for easing monetary policy at present . 
but he cautioned against reading too much into one month &apos;s data . 
&quot; One should not over-react to this , and see what happens in February . 
but it certainly confirms that there is no room at this stage for relaxing on the monetary policy , &quot; he told Reuters by telephone from Pretoria . 
&quot; We &apos;ve certainly not seen a very convincing decline in the rates of increase in the monetary aggregates . 
South Africa &apos;s year-on-year broadly defined M3 money supply grew 16.89 percent in January , preliminary Reserve Bank figures showed . 
annual private sector credit growth was 17.07 percent . 
both figures were considerably higher than the consensus of economists who had forecast 15.8 percent and 15.3 percent respectively . 
Stals said the jump in money supply reflected the large inflow of foreign funds in January , which had boosted reserves . 
the big increase could also reflect , in part , statistical anomalies such as holiday dates . 
he noted that M3 had not shown the normal seasonal decline last month with unadjusted M3 totalling 319.62 billion rand , virtually unchanged from December &apos;s 319.45 billion .
