Egyptian share prices rose on Sunday to reverse a week-long trend that had pushed the overall index to a five-month low . 
the Capital Market Authority ( CMA ) all-share index climbed 2.26 points to 345.69 in below-average turnover of 33.20 million pounds ( $ 9.8 million ) . 
&quot; We &apos;re expecting the whole market to go up in the summer . 
news coming in reflects this rise . 
it &apos;s probably been encouraged by government hints that it could privatise some utilities , &quot; said Mohammed Abdullah , managing director of Intercapital . 
national Societe Generale ( NSG ) was the day &apos;s most active share , rising 0.7 pounds to 81 after trading in four million pounds . 
&quot; National Societe Generale is looked upon as one of the good banks . 
it had a capital increase recently and a stock split , which added a lot of liquidity . 
it will continue to do well , &quot; Abdullah said . 
the French-dominated bank has issued five-year floating-rate notes denominated in Egyptian pounds to raise 150 million pounds for medium-term financing . 
NSG said in a published announcement on Sunday that the subscription , which opened on June 17 , would close on June 30 because it was oversubscribed but it did not say by how much . 
the banks &apos;s general assembly agreed in March to increase NSG &apos;s capital to 120 million pounds from 100 million by issuing one free share for each five . 
commercial International Bank traded in shares worth 3.2 million pounds but closed 0.25 pounds lower at 70.25 . 
fertiliser firm Egyptian Financial and Industrial ( EFI ) was the day &apos;s second most actively-traded share , climbing 6.99 pounds to 203 after shares worth two million pounds changed hands . 
&quot; This is one of the bourse &apos;s golden stocks . 
it is has stirred the interest of foreign investors because of its expansion plans and growth prospects , &quot; Abdullah said . 
the privatised firm was started with a &quot; strong buy &quot; rating by London-based stockbrokers T. Hoare and Co. earlier this month . 
analysts said they based their recommendation on , among other things , the firm &apos;s expansion plans which will make it the world &apos;s largest producer of Single Super phosphate fertiliser by 1999 . 
the Egyptian state sold 65 percent of EFI &apos;s total 3.25 million shares to private investors last year . 
Abdullah said he expected the milling sector to reap the rewards of a public share offer in Alexandria flour Mills which opened on Sunday for two days . 
the state &apos;s Holding Company for Rice and flour Mills has offered to the public at least 400,000 shares , or 10 percent , of Alexandria flour Mills at an initial offer price at 75 pounds per share . 
the state has previously sold part of its stake in several milling firms but it has said it will not reliquish its majority control of the sector because of its &quot; strategic nature &quot; . 
the index for openly traded firms rose to 465.94 points from 461.15 points on Thursday and that for the rarely traded &quot; closed &quot; firms rose to 257.69 from 256.47 points . 
of the 88 shares traded , 37 rose , 31 fell while 20 ended unchanged .
