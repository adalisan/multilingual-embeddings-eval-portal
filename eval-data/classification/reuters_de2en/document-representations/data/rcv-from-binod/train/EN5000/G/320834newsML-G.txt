Unseeded Spaniard Carlos Moya coolly earned a place in the semifinals of the Australian Open on Tuesday after organisers decided to take the heat out of the year &apos;s first grand slam . 
on the third day of a heatwave which has seen courtside temperatures exceed 50 degrees Celsius ( 122 Fahrenheit ) , tournament referee Peter Bellenger sparked a blazing row by ordering that the stadium roof be shut . 
&quot; I was going to play anyway so even if it &apos;s snowing , raining or 60 degrees ( Celsius ) , I don &apos;t care , &quot; Moya told reporters after beating fellow-Spaniard Felix Mantilla in four sets . 
&quot; I was prepared to play in these conditions , &quot; retorted a furious Mantilla . 
&quot; I think it may have been a different match in the sun and wind . 
in the first women &apos;s quarter-final , South African 12th seed Amanda Coetzer showed the same form which helped her bring down top seed Steffi Graf as she ousted American hopeful Kimberly Po . 
Coetzer is seen as the player with the best chance of beating Swiss starlet Martina Hingis if both win through to Saturday &apos;s final . 
her performance on Tuesday could only have reinforced that view . 
Moya put friendship aside as he disposed of 16th-seeded Mantilla 7-5 6-2 6-7 6-2 in two hours and 29 minutes in the air-conditioned stadium . 
the two men are training partners in the former Olympic city of Barcelona . 
since ousting defending champion Boris Becker in the first round , tournament heart-throb Moya has cut a swathe through the draw . 
the local press has dubbed him &quot; King Carlos of Spain &quot; . 
once considered just another Spanish clay-court baseliner , Moya has grown in confidence throughout the championship and on Tuesday he added delicate sliced drop shots and volleys from the net to his usual strong groundstrokes . 
&quot; Felix does not make stupid mistakes , so if you want to beat him you have to take risks , &quot; Moya said . 
Mantilla , who started practising with the roof open and only had four trial serves after it was closed , fought back in the third set and won a tie-break 7-5 . 
but Moya was back in control in the fourth set , breaking his friend &apos;s serve in the fourth game and producing a second-serve ace three games later to go up 5-2 . 
he broke Mantilla &apos;s serve again to wrap up the match . 
it was the best performance by a Spanish man at the Australian Open since Andres Gimeno lost the 1969 final to Australian great Rod Laver . 
Moya &apos;s semifinal opponent will be either world number two Michael Chang of the United States or Chilean danger man Marcelo Rios , the ninth seed . 
number 12 seed Coetzer , who toppled Graf on Sunday , beat Po 6-4 6-1 in a match lasting 67 minutes . 
although Po managed to break Coetzer &apos;s serve once in each set , the South African converted six of six break points . 
she wrapped up the match by breaking Po to love . 
Coetzer also criticised the decision to shut the roof for the day &apos;s play , although she conceded that it had given her and Po a break from the heat . 
Coetzer &apos;s next opponent will be either 1995 champion Mary Pierce of France or Belgian 16th seed Sabine Appelmans . 
Pierce and Applemans were due to play on Tuesday night with the stadium roof once again opened , barring possible rain .
