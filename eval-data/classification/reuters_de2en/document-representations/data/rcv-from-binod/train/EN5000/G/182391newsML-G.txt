Latin America &apos;s democratic leaders have issued their clearest collective call yet on the Western Hemisphere &apos;s lone non-elected regime , Cuba , to allow more political freedoms . 
as expected , the leaders of 19 nations plus Spain and Portugal went through the motions of condemning the Helms-Burton law tightening the U.S. embargo on Cuba at an Ibero-American summit in Chile ending on Monday . 
but in a surprisingly strong statement , they issued a consensus view that no country can call itself a democracy without holding free and fair elections and allowing basic political freedoms . 
dubbed the Declaration of Vina del Mar , the statement said governments should let political parties operate freely , allow &quot; open and transparent &quot; debate and give public and periodic accountings of their actions to their citizens . 
after three days of scrupulously avoiding any direct mention of Cuba , some finally admitted what this talk about elections and political freedoms was really referring to . 
&quot; The issue of Cuba was not treated in an explicit manner . 
but any observer realises that it was treated implicitly in the declarations and deliberations , &quot; said Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera . 
Chilean host and President Eduardo Frei , who set the tone in his opening speech by saying only electoral democracies were &quot; legitimate &quot; , called the Vina del Mar statement the most significant ever adopted at an Ibero-American summit , an annual event since 1991 . 
&quot; There is no pressure on Cuba . 
there are differences of opinion about it , and those have been expressed , &quot; said one foreign minister , speaking not for attribution . 
as if to signal respect for the difference of opinions , Cuban leader Fidel Castro signed the declaration along with the other leaders at the summit &apos;s final session . 
but in the final hours , he heard a polite but steady drumbeat of calls for reform to the political system he has led since he overthrew dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959 . 
&quot; Democracy means the same thing for everyone in the whole world and that includes Cuba , &quot; said Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres . 
Argentine President Carlos Menem compared Castro unfavourably to former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet , saying the latter had allowed Chile to return to democracy while Castro &quot; has led Cuba for 37 years . 
such a comparison would have drawn scorn and shock from Latin American leaders only a few years ago . 
&quot; Some of the presidents wanted to express themselves on Cuba . 
there was a feeling that the best place to do that was in their individual statements , &quot; said the foreign minister .
