after 1,000 days , Angola &apos;s staggering peace process has never been so fragile or the country so close to a return to hostilities , diplomats and officials say . 
on November 20 , 1994 , the Angolan government and former rebel movement the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) , signed a peace agreement in the Zambian capital Lusaka ending nearly two decades of civil war . 
the deal brought the country the longest period of peace since a war of independence was launched against Portugese colonial power in the 1960s . 
&quot; This is by far the most critical point in the peace process since the agreement was signed in 1994 . 
a return to conflict in Angola is a real possibility , &quot; one Western diplomat told Reuters . 
a key goal of the Lusaka accords was achieved in April when a unity government was formed and UNITA members took up their seats in the country &apos;s national assembly . 
but recent weeks have shown a rapid deterioration of the peace process as the government launched a military offensive into UNITA territory and UNITA dragged its feet on remaining crucial elements of the Lusaka agreement . 
in June the United Nations Security Council demanded that UNITA define the number of armed men it still has , begin handing over some of the vast territory is still controls to the government and transform its propaganda radio station , Vorgan , into a non-partisan entity . 
the former rebels were given until last Friday to reply to the demands or face possible sanctions , including restrictions on travel and banking . 
on Friday U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan gave the Security Council the go ahead to impose sanctions by saying last minute &quot; half-hearted concessions by UNITA , under pressure and on the eve of Security Council deliberations , are no longer acceptable . 
diplomats say there may be some delays before sanctions come into force , but they are likely to be in place by September . 
but they will only be words and promises , there will be nothing concrete to them , &quot; said an official close to the peace process . 
the former rebels are already under fuel and arms sanctions that military officials say have been ineffective . 
instead the new sanctions will have a strong psychological effect on an already isolated UNITA and signal to the Angolan government that UNITA is seen by the international community as responsible for the setbacks to the peace process . 
&quot; Practically , the sanctions mean nothing . 
to impose sanctions against a foreign state is hard enough , against a guerilla organisation like UNITA it is impossible , &quot; said a Western diplomat . 
&quot; When the U.N. imposes sanctions the Angolan government will see it as as the U.N. taking sides , saying UNITA is guilty , &quot; he added . 
one official , long close to the peace process , put it bluntly . 
&quot; No matter which way the sanctions issue goes , it is going to be disastrous for Angola . 
if the sanctions are imposed then the government will wait a bit before they move against UNITA . 
if the sanctions are imposed the government will move pretty quickly , &quot; he said .
