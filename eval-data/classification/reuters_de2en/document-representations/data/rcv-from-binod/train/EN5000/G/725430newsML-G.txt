the Russian commander of the crippled Mir space station is overtired and has a problem with his cardiovascular system , Mission Control said on Monday . 
Vasily Tsibliyev , 43 , who is due to undertake risky repairs at the end of the week to save the ageing station , said he had noticed the trouble shortly after the remote-controlled cargo craft he was manoeuvring slammed into Mir on June 25 . 
&quot; It came as a surprise , &quot; he said during a crackly television link-up with Mission Control at Korolyov , outside Moscow . 
journalists could not hear his description of the trouble due to static . 
experts on the ground called it a cardiovascular problem -- relating to the heart , blood supply or lungs , 
Tsibliyev asked whether he could take any medicine , but was advised against it before he and flight engineer Alexander Lazutkin enter Mir &apos;s damaged Spektr module for the repairs . 
their American colleague , NASA physicist Michael Foale , will sit in the escape capsule to evacuate all three if something goes wrong during the complex and unprecedented operation . 
&quot; The main thing is not to worry . 
try to rest as much as possible , &quot; a Mission Control doctor told Tsibliyev . 
&quot; Today we have carried out medical experiments using an exercise bike to test the cosmonauts &apos; cardiovascular systems ... Tsibliyev &apos;s reaction appeared to be negative , &quot; Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin said after the television linkup . 
&quot; The doctors &apos; initial reaction is that Tsibliyev is overtired . 
he has problems with his sleep but his general condition is within the norm &quot; . 
Spektr was holed during the collision -- Mir &apos;s worst ever accident -- and , airless , it is now sealed off from the station . 
Tsibliyev and Lazutkin are due to undertake the complex repair works on Thursday or Friday night . 
mission Control transmitted a video of a mock-up of the unprecedented repair operation undertaken by fellow cosmonauts wearing bulky space suits in a swimming pool -- the nearest they could get to conditions in orbit . 
it will be studied by the crew before a planned six-hour dress rehearsal on the cramped 11-year-old station on Tuesday . 
British-born Foale will be on hand to help his Russian colleagues during the trial run . 
the job will be on Thursday or Friday night , mission director Vladimir Solovyov said . 
the two cosmonauts have prepared their spacesuits for the sortie into the holed Spektr module to reconnect electric cables and restore power from the module &apos;s solar panels . 
rapid reactions after the collision allowed the crew to seal off the Spektr as air escaped through the hole . 
but closing the hatches meant cutting off up to half of Mir &apos;s power supply . 
a Progress cargo vessel brought repair tools and other vital supplies to Mir a week ago and the crew have now finished unloading it . 
among the supplies was equipment to improve communications , making it easier for the cosmonauts to view the training film and stay in contact with Earth during the repairs . 
but the crew have been puzzling over the purpose of one bit of equipment they found on Progress . 
&quot; We are trying to get an answer from you , what is that tap which looks like one in the kitchen ? 
Tsiblieyev said in Monday &apos;s television exchange . 
but no one could immediately tell him . 
&quot; Wait and we will find out , &quot; replied a Mission Control official .
