Japan &apos;s trade surplus is unlikely to continue to grow as drastically as it did in May , Economic Planning Agency ( EPA ) Minister Taro Aso told a news conference on Thursday . 
I don &apos;t expect it to grow as much as it has been doing , &quot; Aso said . 
Aso said that a surge in the trade surplus in May was due to special factors such as the weakness of the yen , lower oil prices , car trade and a drop in demand after an increase in Japan &apos;s consumption tax in April . 
he said he did not think these special factors would continue .
