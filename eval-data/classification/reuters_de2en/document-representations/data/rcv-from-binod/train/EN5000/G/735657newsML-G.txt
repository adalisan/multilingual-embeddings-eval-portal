Cuba on Thursday forcefully criticised the acquittal by a U.S. court of three Cubans accused of hijacking a small plane to Florida last year , saying it could encourage similar actions by other Cubans . 
the three Cubans were found not guilty by a federal jury on Wednesday in Tampa , Florida . 
Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso told a regular news briefing that acquitting the three went counter to stated U.S. policy that it sought to combat hijackings and other acts of terrorism . 
&quot; When you acquit hijackers and you allow them to remain in the United States subject to a decision on their migratory status ... you are stimulating this kind of activity with the message that people who do such things will get away with it , &quot; Alfonso said . 
&quot; This makes a mockery of all the statements that the U.S. authorities make on their interest in combating terrorism , air piracy and other acts of violence , where Cuba is concerned , &quot; he added . 
Adel Regalado Ulloa , Leonardo Reyes Ramirez and Jose Roberto bello Puente , all from Havana , could have been sentenced to a minimum of 20 years in prison each if they had been found guilty by the jury in the U.S. District Court trial . 
they are being held pending action by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalisation Service on their request for asylum . 
Federal prosecutors accused the three of forcing a Cuban pilot to fly them to Florida last Aug . 16 . 
the small plane crashed in the Gulf of Mexico . 
the men were rescued by a Russian freighter and turned over to the U.S. Coast Guard . 
the pilot , allowed by Cuban authorities to attend the trial , testified Monday that the defendants threatened him with a gun and a knife to make him fly them to Florida . 
the defendants said the pilot was a willing participant in the flight and lied about the threats to protect himself from punishment in Cuba . 
Alfonso said the trial , which began on Monday , was strangely rapid and appeared to have been timed to coincide with two days of talks that began Wednesday in New York between Cuba and the United States to review implementation of migration accords signed in September 1994 and May 1995 . 
he said the verdict did not contribute to implementing the letter or spirit of those accords , which he said were aimed at ensuring safe , legal and orderly migration of Cubans to the United States . 
under the 1995 agreement , Washington undertook to repatriate Cubans intercepted trying to reach the United States by boat , while raising the number of visas for Cubans to 20,000 a year . 
both sides also agreed to oppose acts of violence associated with illegal emigration by Cubans towards the United States . 
the aim was to halt a flow of Cuban boat people over the Florida Straits that reached crisis point in 1994 when more than 30,000 left the Communist-ruled island on flimsy rafts . 
another Cuban accused of a hijacking , former Interior Ministry officer Jose Fernandez Pupo , had been declared not guilty of air piracy by a court in Washington on May 29 . 
Fernandez Pupo had been charged with seizing a small passenger plane at gunpoint and forcing it to land at the U.S. 
Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba a year ago . 
Cuba described that court verdict as an example of U.S. &quot; political manipulation .
