a slick television ad shows Singapore military officers regaling young women about their careers in the navy and seeing places like exotic Thailand or cosmopolitan Australia . 
the recruiting commercial for the navy is one of many for the armed forces in Singapore media aimed at getting people to join up . 
and stay in . 
they reflect the reality that to retain its soldiers , the Singapore Armed Forces ( SAF ) competes with a battalion of employers in the country &apos;s robust economy . 
what we have is what we &apos;ve got , &quot; Lieutenant-General Bey Soo Khiang , the 41-year-old SAF chief , told Reuters in an interview . 
&quot; The SAF has to work within the constraints of the tight manpower resource in Singapore , &quot; he added . 
one Singaporean said a long-time soldier in his family recently left the SAF to take a more lucrative job in the private sector . 
the decision is common in the tiny city-state . 
with a per capita income now running ahead of its former colonial master Britain , the attraction to get out is strong . 
&quot; In a very good period of economic growth , recruitment and more so the retention aspect suffers , &quot; Bey said . 
&quot; Most of them are very young . 
many of their officers do not appear to stay long in the service , &quot; a Philippine army officer involved in regular bilateral exercises with the SAF said . 
the SAF has some 50,000 full-time soldiers and 250,000 reservists in a population of just under three million people . 
in contrast , neighbouring Indonesia &apos;s armed forces total nearly 500,000 . 
general Bey said one thing the SAF has done is cut down on the number of people needed , for example , to fire a cannon . 
the SAF acquired 155 mm howitzers in 1973 which had a range of 20 km ( 12.5 miles ) , could fire four rounds a minute , took 12 minutes to deploy and required 12 men to operate . 
a modified howitzer which went into service in the SAF last year has doubled the firing rate , takes about two minutes to deploy and can be operated by just six men , Bey said . 
that effort to increase efficiency is just one example of how , manpower limits or not , the SAF is far froom toothless . 
&quot; Without doubt , Singapore maintains the best equipped military in Southeast Asia , and one of the most professionally run in the entire region , &quot; a recent report by the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy ( PERC ) said . 
Singapore has 15 U.S.-made F-16 fighters in its arsenal and recently ordered 18 more F-16s at a cost of US $ 890 million . 
engine and avionic upgrades have given its estimated 70 A-4 Super Skyhawks and 43 F-5 planes a new lease of life . 
the navy strike squadron consists of six missile corvettes , six missile gunboats and six anti-submarine patrol vessels . 
&quot; It is not a zero-sum game , as it were , that when you cut down manpower , you trade off firepower . 
that is not true , &quot; General Bey said . 
&quot; What we are trying to do is try to develop the SAF with the capability to defend Singapore if the need should arise . 
if we have a capable armed force , then it will act as a deterrent , &quot; Defence Minister Tony Tan said in an interview . 
&quot; The emphasis on defence is understandable ... at the back of everyone &apos;s mind is the unspoken fear that Singapore &apos;s two Malay-Moslem neighbours -- Malaysia and Indonesia -- may one day join together to eliminate the annoyingly prosperous Chinese-dominated island on their doorstep , &quot; the PERC said . 
that prospect seems far-fetched currently since Singapore maintains good ties with both Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur . 
general Bey sees no threat to Singapore &apos;s security for now , but says , &quot; Instability can rear its ugly head very quickly . 
out of nowhere , it just comes up . 
one way the SAF copes is through a network of ties fostered with its neighbours and allies like the United States , Britain and Australia . 
military exercises have been held with Thailand and the United States , another army exercise was held with New Zealand and joint annual exercises are held with the Philippines . 
&quot; Our view has always been that the climate of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific is best ensured by an architecture of strong bilateral relationships complimented by multilateral arrangements like the ARF ( ASEAN Regional Forum ) , &quot; Tan said . 
the ARF , organised by the Association of South East Asian Nations in the early 1990s , allows the organisation to discuss security issues with the United States , Japan and China every year . 
ASEAN groups Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore , the Philippines , Thailand and Vietnam . 
asked if ASEAN &apos;s armies were slowly moving towards a more formal structure , Tan said : &quot; It &apos;s already an ASEAN-wide setup . 
all of us have good relationships with one another . 
so that is a good start .
