Croatian stocks closed mixed to lower on Wednesday with top shares trading on solid volumes and traders foresaw stagnation for most prices this week . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see any leaps forward in the days ahead , unless the dollar builds up again which could push up ( drugs firm ) Pliva and Zagrebacka Banka , &quot; said Zoran Ilic of Consult Invest brokerage . 
&quot; But tourist firms could be on the losing side , &quot; he said . 
four of 19 issues traded on Wednesday rose , eight fell , six were flat and one traded for the first time . 
volume was lower at 24,753 units while turnover fell to 13 million kuna . 
in the longer term , Ilic said the central bourse &apos;s recent decision to lift taxes on deals made between mid-July to mid-August could help the market liquidity during a usually dead summer season . 
&quot; Some stocks could perhaps avoid their usual summer fate and trade at stable levels , &quot; Ilic said . 
Wednesday &apos;s top gainer Zagrebacka Banka added 29.9 kuna or 1.5 percent to 2,000 kuna , selling 2,768 shares . 
Pliva sold 2,081 units , shedding 11 kuna to 501 and it was seen as fluctuating around 500 kuna in the days ahead . 
traders said the strong dollar helped Zagrebacka &apos;s recovery and was also one of the factors which contributed to Tuesday &apos;s record sale of Pliva &apos;s shares -- over 25,000 . 
&quot; All bigger selling orders for Pliva have been completed , so if the dollar does not go wild again , I don &apos;t think Tuesday will be repeated , &quot; Ilic said , adding two big buyers were responsible for the record sale . 
ship repair company Viktor Lenac traded for the first time , after listing its shares in the top segment of the Zagreb bourse this week and becoming the fourth fully-listed stock . 
it sold 3,700 units , closing at 116 kuna . 
&quot; It is a good firm and demand is quite decent , but its offer on the bourse is pretty weak , &quot; one trader who declined to be identified said . 
cement factory Nasicecement , stable at 445 kuna , sold most shares on Wednesday -- 9,700 in a sole transaction behind which was a foreign bank . 
the stock made its market debut earlier in July . 
&quot; ( Bank ) Creditanstalt obviously has an order to buy a large stake in Nasicecement , &quot; one broker said . 
food processor Podravka closed flat at 250 kuna on volume of 3,846 units . 
biggest decliner shipper Jadroplov lost 15 kuna or 10.3 percent to 130 with 86 shares sold .
