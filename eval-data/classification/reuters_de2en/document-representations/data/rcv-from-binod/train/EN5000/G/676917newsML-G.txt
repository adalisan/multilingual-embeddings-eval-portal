angry Palestinians unleashed barrages of fire bombs and stones at Israeli soldiers , who shot and wounded at least 24 of them in the West Bank town of Hebron on Friday in the fiercest day of clashes in a week . 
witnesses and hospital officials said one 18-year-old Palestinian shot in the head with a rubber bullet was in critical condition . 
the clashes underscored tensions over a three-month impasse in Israeli-Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) peace moves and Israel &apos;s expansion of Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank , including Arab East Jerusalem . 
Friday &apos;s violence began when about 100 stone-throwing youths attacked some 60 Israeli soldiers barricaded behind an iron gate separating Jewish enclaves from PLO-controlled areas . 
the first casualty in the Friday clashes was a youth wounded when Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets toward a masked Palestinian who taunted them by waving a burning Israeli flag . 
the youth , who stood near the masked man , was hit , and demonstrators carried him away in a local car to hospital . 
the clashes intensified when the crowed swelled to several hundred . 
masked demonstrators unleashed barrages of fire bombs and stones at Israeli snipers firing rubber bullets from behind barricades , street corners and rooftops , witnesses said . 
one Israeli soldier was hurt when a stun grenade he was trying to hurl at demonstrators fell near him . 
some youths used sling shots against soldiers , while others threw stones by hand . 
the street linking the two parts of Hebron was littered with stones . 
demonstrators broke into chants such as &quot; PLO , Israel No &quot; and &quot; With soul and blood we redeem al-Aqsa &quot; , referring to Islam &apos;s third holiest shrine in Jerusalem , each time a fire bomb landed on the street near the soldiers . 
in one instance , youths hurled a barrage of firebombs at a roof-top room where soldiers were taking cover , setting it on fire . 
firefighters extinguished the flames which threatened the entire building , witnesses said . 
an Israeli army spokeswoman confirmed that firebombs were used in the clashes but she said no soldiers were hurt . 
the clashes dwindled in the afternoon after Palestinian security men in civilian clothes stepped in , pushing demonstrators back , witnesses said . 
clashes erupted in Hebron last Saturday after a U.S. congressional vote demanded President Bill Clinton recognise Arab East Jerusalem -- revered by Palestinians as the capital of their future state -- as part of Israel &apos;s capital . 
more than 100 Palestinians have been wounded in the clashes , including many children .
