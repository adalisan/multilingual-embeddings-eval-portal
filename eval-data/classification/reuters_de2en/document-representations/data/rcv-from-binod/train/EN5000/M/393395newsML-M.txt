the IPE natural gas futures market saw the period from April to August move up in thin trade on Friday , while March and September slipped back . 
the market is now in backwardation from April through to August , before moving back into contango in September and resuming what one broker said was a more predictable pattern of trade . 
&quot; It &apos;s been a reasonable week , &quot; he said . 
&quot; People are looking to use the IPE as an extra source of income , using it to punt around . 
this was seen disappointing compared to the record-breaking sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday . 
but a broker said that as the week wore on bid / offer ranges were getting tighter and there was some hope that interest was increasing even though volumes had turned down . 
Institute of Petroleum ( IP ) Week functions &quot; had a lot to do with the slump in volumes on Thursday , &quot; said a broker .
