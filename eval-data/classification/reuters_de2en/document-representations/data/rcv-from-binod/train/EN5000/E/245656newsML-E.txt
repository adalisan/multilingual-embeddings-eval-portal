the countries of Central eastern Europe should press ahead with modernising their financial sector so as to get ready for European Union ( EU ) membership by 2002-2003 , the World Bank said on Tuesday . 
&quot; Our assessment is that all of these countries are well under way to prepare themselves for EU accession , &quot; said Michel Noel , World Bank Chief of Country Operations in Central Europe . 
&quot; But there are certain areas which require special attention . 
Noel spoke in a lecture to the Central European University about the developments in the financial sectors of Slovenia , Hungary , Slovakia , Poland and the Czech Republic since they have been building market economies . 
the financial sectors of these countries showed a mixed picture and there were no front-runners , he said . 
the countries in the region had the common problems of less developed capital markets , weaker banking supervisions and less privatised banking sectors than needed , Noel added . 
Noel said banking supervisions in the region had the appropriate regulatory background but the quality of their operations still needed improvement to meet the new standards of market economy . 
&quot; That &apos;s key number one challenge in these countries . 
&quot; he told Reuters . 
&quot; The second challenge is in particular with the development of the capital markets , &quot; he said , adding that low turnovers on capital markets in the region hindered financing equitiy , debt and new emerging enterprises . 
&quot; With these low turnovers there is a missing element in the financial sector , &quot; he said . 
&quot; In this area the single most important decision that these countries could make is to reform their pension systems so that private pension funds would flourish and become prime actors to deepen the capital markets , &quot; he added . 
Noel said all the countries of the region should go ahead with the privatisation of banks to prepare their economies for the challenges in the EU . 
he said large state-owned banks in the Czech and the Slovak republics were probably in need of strategic investors to help them to continue restructuring . 
Poland should also privatise some of its large specialised banks , and Slovenia &apos;s largest bank , Ljubjanska Banka was also near a stage where it was ready for privatisation , he said . 
Hungary did much for the privatisation of its banks in the past eighteen months and it should finish what it has begun , Noel added . 
Noel said in his lecture that the insurance sector of the region was less prepared for EU membership than the banking systems , as competition was limited with a relatively small number of insurance companies being present on these markets .
