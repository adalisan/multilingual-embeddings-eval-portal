Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri said on Monday Lebanon would have no need for new foreign borrowing in the near future if his proposed $ 1 billion bond issue to fund emergency social spending was approved . 
&quot; There will be no need for new bonds , &quot; he told Reuters . 
&quot; We have a $ 1 billion bond that needs approval . 
there will be no new bonds ( in the near future ) . 
if there are , there has to be funding to issue them , &quot; he said on the sidelines of an economic conference in Beirut . 
Hariri , plagued by a chronic cash shortage and worried by signs of unrest and a civil disobedience campaign in the eastern Bekaa Valley , this month stunned cabinet ministers with the 30-year $ 1 billion bond proposal . 
if approved by the government , bonds require authorisation from parliament where foreign debt is a volatile issue . 
financiers say the government had made preparations to issue three-year bonds before the first mention of 30-year bonds . 
Central bank sources said any $ 1 billion bond issue would likely involve a range of maturities . 
Hariri &apos;s opponents say he has poured billions of dollars into reconstructing the country ravaged by a 1975-90 civil war while ignoring rural poverty and development needs and burdening the budget . 
his government has come under pressure from former pro-Iranian Hizbollah ( Party of God ) leader Sheikh Sobhi Tufaili who has launched a &quot; hunger revolt &quot; in the form of a civil disobedience campaign to underline poverty in Lebanon . 
&quot; This government has spent more than any other government on development , &quot; Hariri told Reuters . 
Hariri met with economists and private sector business leaders on Monday to review the government &apos;s economic policies , a meeting described as the first of its kind by newspapers . 
participants said the discussion was heated and focused on problems in all sectors of the economy and controversial issues such as the debt . 
Adnan al-Kassar , head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry , said Lebanon needed to take into account the &quot; deterioration in living conditions &quot; caused by the civil war . 
his remarks from a closed session broadcast on state television triggered a quick response from Hariri . 
&quot; I don &apos;t agree that there is a deterioration in living conditions , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Living conditions have improved . 
Hariri , an ambitious entrepreneur , is trying to lure foreign investors and has said his multi-billion dollar reconstruction drive is essential for Lebanon &apos;s economic health . 
he said Lebanon &apos;s biggest company Solidere &apos;s plan to lift all ownership restrictions on its shares and allow foreign investors and local institutions to buy them would likely win government approval . 
&quot; This decision was part of moves to encourage foreign investment , &quot; he said .
