Pakistan will gradually dismantle trade barriers with its arch-rival India on the way to granting it most favoured nation ( MFN ) status by the year 2000 , Commerce Minister Ahmed Mukhtar said Thursday . 
&quot; We are committed to give the MFN status to all the South Asian countries by the year 2000 but will approach the issue in a phased manner , &quot; Mukhtar told a seminar on trade with India . 
he said barriers on raw materials would go first and then those on finished goods , but not without what he predicted would be tough negotiations with India . 
Mukhtar said Pakistan and India , as members of the World Trade Organisation and partners in the South Asian preferential Trade Agreement ( SAPTA ) , were committed to liberalising trade , but might still need to protect domestic industrial investments . 
&quot; Even after according MFN , it is still permissible to impose non-tariff barriers or ban certain items that would adversely affect domestic industry by the imposition of anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties , &quot; he said . 
Pakistan and India are the main trading partners in the seven-nation South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) which launched SAPTA last year in a first step towards the goal of creating a regional free-trade zone . 
SAARC members have agreed to cut tariffs on 35 items under the pact . 
India has already granted MFN status -- under which two countries undertake to give each other the maximum tariff concessions on their mutual trade which they already grant to other countries -- to all SAARC nations , including Pakistan . 
Mukhtar noted the tension between Pakistan and India , which have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947 . 
&quot; Three wars have been fought , our country was dismembered , in Kashmir the carnage continues . 
this notwithstanding , the question arises is it the time to bury the hatchet , &quot; he said .
