Slovenia on Wednesday said it had dismissed its honorary consul to Liberia , two months after an Italian prosecutor issued an international warrant for his arrest on suspicion of smuggling arms . 
in June , an Italian prosecutor issued an arrest warrant for Nicholas Oman , accusing him of smuggling arms to Slovenia , Croatia and Bosnia . 
the warrant was soon recalled due to lack of evidence . 
the Slovenian government declined to explain its decision to remove Oman . 
&quot; The decision was taken on July 25 , but it remained confidential until now because the man and the country in question had to be notified first , &quot; said Branko Vidrih , a spokesman for the government information office . 
Oman was appointed Slovenia &apos;s honorary consul to Liberia in 1993 .
