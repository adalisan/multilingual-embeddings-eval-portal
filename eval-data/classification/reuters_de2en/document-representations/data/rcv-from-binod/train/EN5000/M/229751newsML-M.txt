new York-based commodities exchange NYMEX / COMEX said on Monday it expected to decide by the first quarter of calendar 1997 whether to expand its copper warehouse network outside the United States . 
&quot; Right now Latin America has been the one ( potential site ) that &apos;s gotten the most attention , &quot; John Moore , chairman of the COMEX Governors Committee , told Reuters . 
Moore earlier told an Asia-Pacific commodity Markets Conference that the rival London Metal Exchange ( LME ) had virtually &quot; declared war &quot; on NYMEX / COMEX when it began opening copper warehouses in the United States about two years ago . 
Moore would not rule out establishing a warehouse network in a host of countries including Mexico and Australia , but said specific plans have not yet been formulated . 
&quot; Canadians have continuously shown an adverse reaction to having warehouses in Canada , &quot; he said .
