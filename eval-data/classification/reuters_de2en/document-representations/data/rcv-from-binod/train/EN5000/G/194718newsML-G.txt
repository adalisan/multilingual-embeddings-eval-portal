Australia &apos;s Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said on Saturday that outspoken race row MP Pauline Hanson was pushing a &quot; dumb and divisive &quot; political agenda . 
speaking in Melbourne before the launch of a photographic exhibition on multiculturalism by Marina Mahathir , daughter of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad , Fischer also defended his government &apos;s refusal to criticise Malaysia for the suppression of a conference on East Timor last weekend . 
Hanson sparked a passionate national debate on race and immigration with a maiden parliamentary speech two months ago warning Australia was being swamped by Asians . 
the Queensland MP also criticised government assistance for Aborigines and has aimed her barbs at other minority groups too . 
&quot; As the member for Oxley ( Hanson ) works her way through her predictable list , mainly Asians , Aborigines , gays and most recently Indonesian and Singaporean soldiers , it can be fully expected next week it will be the Maories and kiwis and maybe even an invasion from Chile , &quot; Fischer said . 
Australia had a large intake of Chilean migrants in the 1970s . 
Fischer said he understood Hanson would appear on a television gardening programme next week . 
&quot; Her agenda remains dumb and divisive and is now taking the next media turn to be expected , namely the garden show circuit . 
Australian Prime Minister John Howard has been widely criticised for not directly condemning Hanson for her remarks . 
but Fischer , who heads the junior party in the ruling conservative coalition and is also trade minister , has been less reluctant to attack Hanson . 
Fischer defended the federal government &apos;s decision not to lecture Malaysia over a short-lived conference last week on human rights in the territory of East Timor . 
Malaysian police arrested 46 international participants at the conference , including 10 Australians . 
&quot; At the end of the day there will be areas where Australians and the Australian government will disagree with aspects of human rights ... in Asia , &quot; Fischer said . 
&quot; But that should be kept in perspective as many in Asia disagree with certain internal policies of Australia .
