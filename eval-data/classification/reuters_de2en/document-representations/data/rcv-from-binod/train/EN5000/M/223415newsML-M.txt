1625 GMT - The Swiss franc closed lower against the dollar but was slightly firmer against the market in quiet late trade thinned by the U.S. thanksgiving Day holiday . 
dollar / Swiss touched a new 22-month high versus the franc in Europe of 1.2988 . 
the last time the franc traded lower against the dollar was February 8 , 1995 , when the dollar got up to 1.3018 francs . 
Adam Beaudin , trading strategy analyst at Credit Suisse , said the thin market created opportunity to push the dollar higher . 
the dollar was also near key levels in the yen , at 114.00 , in the mark at 1.54 and the Swiss franc at 1.30 , which may be difficult to break decisively above . 
Beaudin said the Swiss franc was helped a bit against the mark by comments from Swiss National Bank chief economist Georg Rich . 
rich , asked by reporters for comments on the current exchange rate situation , said the Swiss National Bank was satisfied by the reaction of the exchange rate to its monetary policy . 
some traders interpretted his use of the word &quot; satisfied &quot; to mean that the SNB was content with levels as they are and was not seeking further franc declines . 
the Swiss franc may have also gained from favourable reaction on Thursday to the Swiss government &apos;s latest bond tender , which garnered an allocation of 766 million Swiss francs SWIW . 
the allocation was larger than some traders had expected . 
* Dollar closes at 1.2950 / 2960 Swiss francs versus 1.2880 / 2890 francs at Wednesday &apos;s close . 
* Mark ends at 84.51 / 54 Swiss francs versus 84.57 / 59 francs on Wednesday .
