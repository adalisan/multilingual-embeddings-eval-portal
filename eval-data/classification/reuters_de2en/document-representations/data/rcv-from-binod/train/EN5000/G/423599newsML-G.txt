Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Thursday he would reshuffle his cabinet in the next few days , heightening expectations that liberal Kremlin Chief-of-Staff Anatoly Chubais is to join the government . 
&quot; There will definitely be changes ... There will be a series of changes in the coming days , &quot; Chernomyrdin told an evening news conference following a cabinet meeting . 
earlier in the day , President Boris Yeltsin told parliament he wanted a government shake-up to end the deplorable economic and social situation in the country . 
Chernomyrdin refused to name names and declined to say what , if any , role Chubais , the architect of Russia &apos;s post-Soviet privatisation programme , might have in his government . 
&quot; I think that Anatoly Borisovich ( Chubais ) is a specialist , a high-calibre economist . 
if he does work in the government , it will be a gain for the government , of that I &apos;m sure , &quot; he said . 
the prime minister declined to give details of the upcoming government changes , but stressed said he would announce his plan &quot; literally &quot; in the next few days . 
official sources said Chubais was almost certainly to become Chernomyrdin &apos;s number two . 
Interfax news agency quoted Kremlin sources as saying Yeltsin would sign a decree on Friday naming Chubais first deputy prime minister overseeing economic reforms . 
Chubais , who was instrumental in Yeltsin &apos;s presidential re-election campaign last year , is loathed by Yeltsin &apos;s communist and nationalist opponents in parliament who accuse the 41-year-old economist of personally profiting from the sell-off -- charges he denies . 
earlier on Thursday , Chubais said Yeltsin had not yet decided whether to parachute him into government . 
in his remarks , Chernomyrdin , who has been prime minister since December 1992 , said he accepted Yeltsin &apos;s criticisms of the administration and would work to put matters right . 
Chernomyrdin earlier told the cabinet he was planning an overhaul of the way his government ran its business to implement reforms and reduce bureaucratic interference in the economy . 
&quot; The time has come to concentrate on the most essential questions -- to change the style of the government &apos;s work , its structure and personal composition . 
we will act decisively and systematically , &quot; the premier said . 
Chernomyrdin also said the Finance Ministry should not be the dominant body in economic policy and that the role of the Economy Ministry in this area should be strengthened . 
that could spell the sack for Finance Minister Alexander Livshits , who has already suffered Chernomyrdin &apos;s public wrath this week . 
&quot; The Economy Ministry should be the headquarters of the country &apos;s economic policy , &quot; he told the cabinet . 
&quot; Here is where the conception of the budget and the development of federal programmes will begin . 
Chernomyrdin said the Economy Ministry should not be less powerful than the Finance Ministry , which was displaying excessive bureaucracy and arrogance towards the regions and other ministries . 
the premier said he wanted to end some ministries , hangovers from Soviet days of comprehensive central planning , which are responsible for specific industrial sectors , many of which have now been almost entirely privatised .
