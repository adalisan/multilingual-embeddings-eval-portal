the Chinese yuan closed slightly down at 8.2952 on Tuesday from Monday &apos;s 8.2950 against the U.S. dollar in Shanghai on profit-taking , traders said . 
the weighted average price on Monday was 8.2948 . 
the yuan opened higher at 8.2941 and hit an intraday high of 8.2940 early in trading . 
it then consolidated for most of the session , hitting a low of 8.2956 right before the close . 
trading was active with most business done at about 8.2948 , traders said . 
dealers said profit-taking set in after the yuan &apos;s solid rise over the past week , forcing it back below the psychologically-important 8.2950 level at the close . 
&quot; The yuan failed to rise further today due to heavy selling pressure after the rises of the last week , though pro-yuan sentiment is still strong on the market , &quot; one trader said . 
in the past few weeks , whenever the yuan has moved above the 8.2950 level , profit-taking has set in , he added . 
a second dealer said the level was important mainly due to signs that the central bank was prepared to intervene to prevent the yuan from rising beyond it . 
&quot; The central bank &apos;s intentions are never made clear , but fears of intervention have had an impact on the market , &quot; he said . 
dealers said they expected the yuan to move around 8.2950 on Wednesday . 
the yuan closed up at 6.5921 from 6.6493 against 100 Japanese yen and up at an intraday high of 1.0656 from 1.0700 against the Hong Kong dollar .
