three naked British soldiers enjoying a drink in a crowded bar in a Cyprus holiday resort were arrested by police on Wednesday . 
the three were charged with indecency and each fined 150 pounds ( $ 295 ) at a civilian court , a British army spokesman said . 
&quot; While regrettable , last night &apos;s incident can only be put down to high jinks , &quot; spokesman Mervyn Wynne-Jones said . 
the three Royal marines - Glynn Mike McNary , 19 , Matthew Ronald Hughes , 22 , and Paul Anthony Bray , 22 - were in Cyprus on a training mission .
