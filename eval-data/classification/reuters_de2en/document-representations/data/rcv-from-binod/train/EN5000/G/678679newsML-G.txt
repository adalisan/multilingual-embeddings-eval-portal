Slovakian sprinter Jan Svorada completed a hat-trick of victories in the Tour of Catalonia by taking an uneventful fourth stage on Sunday . 
Briton Chris Boardman retained his 12-second lead in the overall standings and looks likely to increase his advantage in Monday &apos;s time-trial . 
Svorada had to shake off strong challenges from Federico Colonna and Federic Moncassin to win the stage . 
&quot; This time it was more difficult because I had to start from further out , &quot; Svorada said . 
the jockeying for position ahead of the sprint for the line provided some of the few interesting moments in the stage . 
the race continues on Monday with a 22-km time-trial starting and ending in Vic . 
the route is ideally suited to Boardman , the world one-hour record holder . 
Boardman has held the lead since the first day and , after resisting the challenge of the mountain specialists , is clear favourite to win .
