the Fed is likely to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at the next meeting of its policy-setting body on May 20 , Massachussetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) professor Rudiger Dorbusch said . 
&quot; I expect that the Fed raises rates ( on May 20 ) because at the current pace of economic growth we &apos;re heading toward the end of the year toward 4.5 percent unemployment rate . 
and really nobody has the right to believe that that isn &apos;t an inflation issue , &quot; Dornbusch said . 
in an interview with Reuters Financial Television , the economist added that he believes the Fed has to raise rates by &quot; 25 basis points now and 25 basis points ready at hand sometime later in the year . 
the MIT economist also said he expects the dollar to remain in its current trading range . 
&quot; With a turn around in Europe and Japan , mild but coming on , it was a question of time when the dollar would normalize and nobody wanted to sleep with a long dollar position 
&quot; By the same token now we are in a neighborhood where the dollar would stay , but with volatility , &quot; Dornbusch said . 
Dornbusch said he does not expect the dollar exchange rate to rise to 1.80 marks . 
the MIT economist also said he believes a range between 110 and 120 yen per dollar is &quot; plausible . 
&quot; There is no hard exchange rate target ... but between 110 and 120 I don &apos;t think central banks have any interest whatsoever to intervene , &quot; Dornbusch said .
