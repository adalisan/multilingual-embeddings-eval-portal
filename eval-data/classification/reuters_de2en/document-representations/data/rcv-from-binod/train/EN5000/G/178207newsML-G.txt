Stan Collymore answered his critics by turning up to play -- and then scoring twice as Liverpool Reserves beat Sheffield Wednesday Reserves 4-0 at Anfield on Saturday . 
it was widely rumoured around Liverpool that Collymore , the one-time English record signing who was fined a club record 20,000 pounds ( $ 33,000 ) by Liverpool after failing to appear for a reserve game in midweek , would not turn up to play in Saturday &apos;s reserve match either . 
but Collymore proved his critics wrong , and scored the opener after 26 minutes and added a second from the penalty spot seven minutes later . 
Collymore &apos;s refusal to play for the reserves at Tranmere on Wednesday and recent poor form when he has played for the first team have created rumours that his turbulent 16-month spell at Anfield is about to end . 
he joined the club for a then-British record fee of 8.5 million pounds ( $ 14 million ) from Nottingham Forest before the start of last season , but there has been much speculation he might move to either Aston Villa or return to Forest .
