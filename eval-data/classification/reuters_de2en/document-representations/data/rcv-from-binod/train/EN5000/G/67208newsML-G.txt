a poll published Friday of Colorado voters showed President Clinton leading his Republican rival Bob Dole by 41 percent to 36 percent , but with a five-percentage point margin of error the Rocky Mountain state looks like a tossup . 
the poll in The Denver Post was conducted by the Norwest Public Policy Research Programme at the University of Colorado at Denver . 
reform Party standard-bearer Ross Perot had six percent and 12 percent were undecided , according to the poll of 407 registered voters taken between Sept . 9-12 . 
dole , the former senator from neighbouring Kansas , has visited Colorado three times since he received the Republican nomination in August . 
Clinton has also campaigned here since the Democratic convention . 
the poll also showed a dead heat in the hotly contested election for the Senate seat being vacated by one-term Republican Hank Brown . 
Republican Representative Wayne Allard was a favourite of 40 percent of those polled to 39 percent for millionaire lawyer Democrat Tom Strickland , who has never held public office . 
seventeen percent were undecided .
