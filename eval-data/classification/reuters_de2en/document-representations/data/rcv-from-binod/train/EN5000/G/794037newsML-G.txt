officials finally showed Fernando Carreira the money on Tuesday , handing the Miami caretaker $ 45,000 in rewards for leading police to suspected serial killer Andrew Cunanan . 
Carreira , who stumbled upon the alleged killer of Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace in Cunanan &apos;s houseboat hideout , did not get his reward without a fight . 
he hired a lawyer , filed a lawsuit and became an instant celebrity after authorities initially balked at turning over the cash . 
at a ceremony at Miami Beach City Hall , Carreira , 71 , was given checks totalling $ 35,000 . 
with the $ 10,000 he had already collected from a New York gay and lesbian group , that made Carreira $ 55,000 richer . 
by mistake . 
but it was him , &quot; he said . 
&quot; So I think that put a stop on a lot of problems ... and saved millions and millions of dollars to the taxpayers . 
Carreira found Cunanan , the suspected killer of Versace and four others , on July 23 when he went to check on a houseboat he looked after . 
when he went aboard , he heard a gunshot , fled and called police . 
after a four-hour siege , police stormed the houseboat and found the body of Cunanan , who had shot himself . 
Carreira never saw Cunanan , and police initially played down the caretaker &apos;s role , saying they would have to examine his story carefully before handing over the rewards . 
new York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the $ 10,000 reward offered by his city would not be given to Carreira because he had not called a special Cunanan hotline . 
but the Portuguese immigrant battled back , and the public was clearly on his side . 
while he filed suit against Miami Beach and Dade County and made the rounds of television talk shows , volunteers collected money on Miami Beach streets under the rallying cry &quot; Show Him the Money . 
&quot; &quot; Show me the money &quot; was a frequently repeated line in the recent movie &quot; Jerry Maguire . 
the money Carreira collected on Tuesday included $ 10,000 each from Miami Beach , Dade County and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement , while the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau provided $ 5,000 . 
Carreira wore a suit for the occasion instead of the Versace shirt he had lately taken to wearing .
