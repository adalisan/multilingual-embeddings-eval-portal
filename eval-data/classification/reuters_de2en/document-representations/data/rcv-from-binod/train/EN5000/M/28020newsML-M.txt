the Australian / U.S. 
10-year bond yield spread hit its lowest level in over two years as the local market factored in the possibility of a further easing in monetray policy as early as this week , traders said . 
the spread contracted to around 115 basis points early on Monday after breaching resistance at 120 basis points , and a further narrowing is seen possible . 
fears of an interest rate hike in the U.S. amid further data signally an expanding economy sent U.S. treasuries reeling on Friday and dragged Canadian and New Zealand bonds with them . 
however , a subdued local inflation outlook saw some decoupling from the U.S. move by the local market , traders said . 
&quot; This spread may be squashed a little but further , but we have come a long way in a short period of time , &quot; said Tim Pfitzner , economist at National Australia Bank . 
the 10-year spread has contracted from over 250 basis points since mid-April . 
the U.S. market is closed today for Labor Day . 
political factors also weighed on New Zealand debt ahead of the N.Z. 
election on October 12 . 
meanwhile , domestic rate cut speculation saw the local yield curve steepen with the cash three / 10-year spread spiking to it highest level in almost a year at 95 basis points .
