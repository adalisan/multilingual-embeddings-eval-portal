with little critical questioning , President Bill Clinton &apos;s nominee for transportation secretary sailed easily through Senate confirmation hearings on Wednesday and headed for final approval next week . 
Federal Highway Administrator Rodney Slater , asked about his role in a Clinton re-election working group that advised blacks not to vote for Republicans because they opposed civil rights , said the language did not reflect his thinking . 
Sen. John McCain , chairman of the Commerce , Science and Transportation Committee , cited an election report by the African American Working Group that labeled Republicans as enemies of civil rights and urged blacks to vote Democratic . 
Slater told the panel he was very much a part of the group , but &quot; I think it &apos;s unfortunate that maybe that language was stated that way , &quot; and he said it was never intended to debase Republicans . 
he added , &quot; It has always been my policy to give a person a reason to vote -- for something -- rather than to vote against something . 
McCain , an Arizona Republican , added that there was nothing in Slater &apos;s record while a member of the Arkansas state highway commission and as federal highway administrator that indicated he shared those anti-republican views . 
Slater , questioned about his extensive travel as federal highway administrator , logging in some 300,000 miles ( 480,000 km ) to 40 states , said the trips were necessary to meet local highway officials and to assure that local highway needs were met . 
he added that any campaigning he did while on the trips was not paid for by public funds . 
throughout the hearing Republicans and Democrats alike gave the nominee high marks , with no indication there would be any opposition when the committee met to vote . 
McCain said he expected both a committee vote and a vote in the full Senate sometime next week . 
Slater pledged to continue the U.S. effort to end restrictive bilateral aviation agreements in favour of free market &quot; open skies &quot; accords . 
he said that progress was being made in the two-year old U.S. attempt to write an open skies pact with Britain , adding &quot; We hope to reach common ground soon , &quot; but gave no details . 
Slater , aware of the constituent interests of committee members , sought to present an open mind to their concerns that ranged from Amtrak , rail mergers , subsidies for airlines serving remote regions and car exhaust emission standards . 
he said he would urge renewal of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act to assure that various modes of transport link up nationwide to better move people and cargo . 
asked about dedicating 50 cents of the federal gasoline tax to help finance money-losing Amtrak , Slater said a bill to fund the national passenger railroad system would be submitted later , and said only that creative funding approaches had to be considered . 
and asked about renewing a regulation that carmakers gradually improve the fuel efficiency of cars , he said , &quot; We are continuing to look at the issue . 
pressed by carmakers who said improved fuel efficiency meant that smaller , and more dangerous , cars had to be built , the government froze the standards several years ago . 
environmentalist would like to see them reinstated . 
asked about rail mergers , Slater noted that law now says the public interest must be taken into account , along with competitive issues , but added that a review might be needed . 
&quot; In light of both recent and pending rail mergers , we might want to re-examine those merger standards to see if they are producing the kind of rail system that is truly in the public interest , &quot; he said .
