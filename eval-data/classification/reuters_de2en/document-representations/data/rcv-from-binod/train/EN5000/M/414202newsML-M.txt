Mediterranean and West African crude oil markets remained weak and inactive on Monday and a million-barrel cargo of Iraqi Kirkuk for loading before March 10 remained on offer , traders said . 
the cargo is extra to six spot contracts totalling 6.05 million barrels approved by the United Nations to bring revenue from the oil-for-food deal close to the $ 1 billion target for the first three months . 
&quot; No one &apos;s seen it placed as yet . 
Kirkuk looks competitive , assuming that there is going to be the appetite from refineries to take it , &quot; a trader said . 
provisional values were assessed by some traders around 25 / 30 cents below the official selling price of dated Brent - $ 1.55 . 
Kirkuk has been trading at around dated Brent - $ 1.70 / $ 1.60 a barrel on the spot market . 
talk that a Urals traded at dated Brent -94 / -95 cents on Friday failed to convince traders the market had moved substantially away from dated - $ 1 / - $ 1.10 . 
traders said sour demand was not seen picking up before mid-month because a large amount of Urals was placed in the first decade of March . 
with sour sentiment weak , the closure for 72 hours of maintenance of the main crude oil pipeline feeding the Russian Black Sea oil terminal at Novorossiisk failed to put a floor under Urals , traders said . 
offers for March loadings of Syrian Light are still around dated Brent -60 cents , with Sytrol dug in around -50 cents , traders said . 
Libya left most crude export prices unchanged for March loadings but cut the price of its key Es Sider crude by 10 cents to dated Brent -5 cents , traders said . 
Cyprus has applied for United Nations permission to buy 110,000 tonnes of crude oil from Iraq , a representative of the Commerce Ministry said , adding the price per barrel would be at the OPS . 
traders said the West African spot market was even quieter than last week because several customers of Nigerian state oil company NNPC had left their offices to go to Lagos for discussions on term contracts . 
bonny Light and qua Iboe was assessed notionally at dated Brent + 40 / 45 cents , around five cents weaker , with weak appetites at European and Far Eastern refineries seen mostly to blame for continuing softness . 
Forcados was notionally valued 10 cents weaker at dated Brent + 15 / 20 cents . 
Cabinda was seen at the equivalent to dated Brent -90 cents . 
traders said an assessment heard in New York of minus $ 1.25 / $ 1.50 a barrel fob , loading in March , sounded like a buyer &apos;s number .
