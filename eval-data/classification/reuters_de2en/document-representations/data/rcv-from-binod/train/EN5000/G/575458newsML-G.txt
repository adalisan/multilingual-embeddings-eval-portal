Australian marathon swimmer Susie Maroney , 22 , neared her goal of a U.S. landfall on Monday as she passed Sand Key , a tiny island about six miles ( 10 km ) east-southeast of Key West . 
&quot; She &apos;s going with the tide and with the current , &quot; said Connie Tignatiello , one of Maroney &apos;s U.S. coordinators , who said she was in contact with Maroney &apos;s lead boat , the reel Lady . 
Tignatiello said she expected Maroney to make landfall in between 1-1 / 2 and three hours . 
&quot; She &apos;s strong enough to swim right up to Fort Taylor Beach , &quot; she said , referring to the historic fort on the western tip of Key West , considered the southernmost point in the continental United States . 
Maroney had already bested her failed effort last year to become the first person to cross the 90-mile ( 145-km ) Florida Straits , which divide Florida and Cuba and have been considered one of swimming &apos;s last great challenges . 
a storm , heavy seas and adverse currents forced Maroney to abandon that attempt last June when she was only 12 miles ( 19 km ) short of the Florida keys and after she had battled for 38-1 / 2 hours . 
she vomited and hallucinated before being plucked from the water . 
two television crews , from Australia and the United States , were aboard accompanying boats , filming Maroney &apos;s current attempt . 
Tignatiello said one of the pontoons supporting the shark cage had been damaged overnight on Sunday as Maroney swam through rough water , raising questions about how long the swimmer would be able to remain in the cage . 
&quot; They &apos;re scared to let her out of the shark cage , because not only is it rough but they &apos;ve spotted two sharks , &quot; she said .
