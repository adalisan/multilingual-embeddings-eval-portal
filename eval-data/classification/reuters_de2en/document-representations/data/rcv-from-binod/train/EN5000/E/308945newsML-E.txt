California Gov. 
Pete Wilson &apos;s $ 66.6 billion 1997-1998 budget plan is balanced with a modest reserve but does not provide funding for current or future emergencies , the Legislative analyst said Wednesday . 
the Republican governor &apos;s proposed general fund budget is balanced with a reserve of $ 553 million . 
the Legislative analyst &apos;s Office , which provides fiscal and policy advice to the California legislature , said the modest reserve was an improvement but was relatively small compared to the size of the budget . 
&quot; Building a larger reserve should remain a key budgetary priority , &quot; the analyst said . 
&quot; The governor &apos;s proposed reserve of $ 553 million could be eaten up very quickly , &quot; Legislative analyst Elizabeth Hill told reporters at a briefing . 
given today &apos;s favorable economic conditions , Hill added , the state should build up the budget reserve in case of emergencies . 
Wilson released his proposed 1997-1998 state budget on January 9 . 
it called for funding increases for education and prisons and significant funding reductions for welfare . 
the plan also included a 10 percent bank and corporation tax cut phased in during 1998 and 1999 . 
the budget-year cost of the proposal was estimated at $ 88 million , Hill said . 
the annual cost of the proposed tax cut would rise to $ 647 million in 2000-2001 when the proposal is fully phased in , the Legislative analyst said . 
Wilson &apos;s budget forecasts were generally consistent with recent projections made by other economists , although Wilson &apos;s personal income forecast was slightly above the consensus . 
hill said the budget &apos;s revenue forecast was lower than the Legislative analyst &apos;s forecast by $ 266 million in 1996-1997 and $ 399 million in 1997-1998 , or $ 665 million combined . 
the difference reflected the budget &apos;s more conservative sales tax revenue estimates , the Legislative analyst said .
