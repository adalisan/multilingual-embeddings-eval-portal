NWE gasoline prices rose sharply on Thursday and were waiting for further direction from NYMEX after a round of U.S. inventory reports . 
American Petroleum Institute said on Wednesday night that gasoline stocks fell 2.9 million barrels , while the Energy Information Administration showed a drop of 1.8 million barrels . 
but traders said the sharp rally in crude and NYMEX gasoline late Wednesday mirrored a strong gasoline market here . 
traders said the arbitrage to the U.S. still looked open , underpinning NWE . 
&quot; The market at this stage looks very strong , &quot; one trader said . 
Eurograde barges jumped $ 7- $ 8 with offers now at $ 232 fob Ara and regular unleaded at $ 218 / $ 220 . 
premium unleaded traded at $ 228 fob Ara and three times at $ 230 , they said . 
a 15,000 tonne premium unleaded cargo traded late on Wednesday at $ 223 fob for prompt delivery , near price levels today . 
CIF cargoes were priced at $ 230 / $ 231 .
