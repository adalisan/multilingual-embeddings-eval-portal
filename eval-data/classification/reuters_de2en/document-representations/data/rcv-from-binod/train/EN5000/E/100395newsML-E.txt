the Commerce Department makes a key ruling Tuesday in a controversial anti-dumping case brought by Florida tomato growers against Mexico , amid charges U.S. producers are using politics to get protection . 
the case has stirred up a firestorm of differing opinions among agricultural groups , lawmakers and factions within the administration who believe that either the American growers have a justified gripe , or that the U.S. industry is making a blatent attempt during an election year to get special favours . 
&quot; What we &apos;ve objected to is the politicization of the whole process , &quot; said Todd Kemp of the National grain &amp; Feed Association , a producer lobbying group . 
&quot; We think it &apos;s an election year effort to help a small group of Florida growers , and it &apos;s fairly transparent . 
critics of the industry complaint said Florida &apos;s 25 electoral votes have caused the administration to look more sympathetically at the U.S. growers &apos; position and could colour the Commerce Department &apos;s decision . 
even Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor has been accused of playing politics to try to gain Florida &apos;s support and applying pressure to agency officials to come out with a decision favouring American producers . 
&quot; We have total confidence in the integrity of the process , and in the integrity of the result , &quot; said the official . 
officials representing U.S. growers admitted that the U.S. industry has used current politics to advance its case , but said if American growers do not get relief soon , many U.S. vegetable farms will be lost and Americans will end up paying more for foreign-grown produce . 
&quot; All we &apos;re asking for is enforcement of U.S. dumping and trade laws . 
our industry is hanging on by a thread , &quot; said Ray Gilmore of the Florida Fruit &amp; Vegetable Association . 
&quot; Presidential politics is a key , because we believe our blip on the radar is brighter now than it will be after November , &quot; said Gilmore . 
U.S. tomato growers have charged that since the North American Free Trade Agreement was implemented in 1993 , Mexico has been &quot; dumping &quot; its produce in the United States at below market prices , taking away more than $ 400 million worth of business from U.S. producers . 
growers from about a dozen states are represented in the complaint , but Florida , which grows 95 percent of the fresh tomatoes produced in the United States in the winter months , clearly has the largest stake in the issue . 
Florida producers launched an aggressive campaign earlier this year to protect their market share , which has dropped from almost 70 percent when NAFTA was signed to under 40 percent this past winter . 
they filed two trade complaints with the government , and launched a drive on Capitol Hill to change trade laws in their favour . 
their effort to change legislation has stalled in the halls of Congress , and a federal agency this summer dismissed one of the industry &apos;s complaints . 
but sources close to the investigation said the U.S. industry has a much better chance in the dumping case for a favourable decision . 
the Commerce Department &apos;s International Trade Administration will make a prelminary ruling on whether Mexican tomatoes are being dumped in U.S. markets and at what levels . 
if the decision is in favour of the U.S. industry , the department &apos;s investigation continues , and a final ruling will be issued at the end of November , which could lead to import duties on Mexican tomatoes next year . 
Mexico has threatened to retaliate against other U.S. agricultural imports if action is taken against its tomato growers . 
that possibility has caused a large group of U.S. farm organisations to oppose the complaint .
