* Australian bonds push into firmer territory through the afternoon as market remains optimnistic on chances of a rate cut following this week &apos;s RBA board meeting . 
* analysts say market vulnerable to pullback if rates steady . 
Australian bonds posted some afternoon gains to finish in positive territory as the market remained buoyed on the prospect of a local rate cut following this week &apos;s Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) board meeting . 
bonds had been flat to firmer through a thin morning session , but afternoon buying took bonds higher but trade remained thin . 
while firmer , bonds remain below the levels of earlier this month when a rate cut was aggressively factored in . 
economists see the prospect of a rate cut during July as a better than even chance , although much will depend on the outcome of the U.S. FOMC meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday . 
Robertson said the market had moved to factor in a cut aggressively on the back of two figures reported earlier this month - a 1.7 percent fall in April retail trade and a 40,300 fall in May employment . 
&quot; The market is clearly vulnerable to the RBA being less profoundly affected by these data and remaining on hold this week , &quot; he said , and others agreed . 
&quot; The key risk to the market will be if the RBA holds off reducing rates to assess the key price and activity data released over the month of July , &quot; Societe Generale economist Glenn Maguire said .
