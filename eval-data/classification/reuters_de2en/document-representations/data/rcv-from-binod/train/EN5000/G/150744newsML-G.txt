the specter of the O.J. 
Simpson murder case hangs over next week &apos;s election for Los Angeles County district attorney . 
unless he can shed the sobriquet &quot; the man who lost the Simpson trial , &quot; Gil Garcetti risks not being re-elected on November 5 to a second four-year term . 
even as Simpson &apos;s civil trial was taking place , Garcetti , who became America &apos;s best-known district attorney last year under the intense media spotlight of Simpson &apos;s criminal trial , was facing a challenge from one of his own deputies , John Lynch . 
at the March primary Garcetti was forced into a runoff election after he picked up only 37 percent of the vote to Lynch &apos;s 21 percent . 
lynch was hammered in his campaign about the apparent inability of the district attorney &apos;s office under Garcetti to win big cases such as the Simpson murder trial . 
Garcetti countered by portraying Lynch as an insensitive bureaucrat , uninterested in issues like spousal and child abuse that Garcetti championed . 
and in recent TV ads he turned the tables on Lynch , and the war of words has turned nastier . 
Garcetti pointed to his challenger &apos;s apparent mishandling of several other well-publicized trials , including the prosecution of savings-and-loan chief Charles Keating . 
Garcetti &apos;s ad concluded Lynch is &quot; too risky to be D.A. 
lynch branded the spots &quot; sleazy &quot; and &quot; a pathetic attempt to scare people , &quot; pointing out that he won Keating &apos;s conviction on fraud charges and that the case was overturned only because of faulty jury instructions by the judge . 
&quot; For 10 months this campaign has been about Gil , &quot; said Garcetti &apos;s campaign manager Matt Middlebrook . 
&quot; Now John &apos;s getting hot under the collar because all of a sudden it &apos;s about him . 
but it is the Simpson case that haunts Garcetti . 
Simpson was acquitted on October 3 , 1995 , in the murders of his ex-wife and a friend , despite what Garcetti said was a &quot; mountain of evidence . 
&quot; The former football star was on trial this week in a civil wrongful-death lawsuit brought by the families of the victims . 
during debates with Lynch Garcetti defended his record . 
&quot; We convinced about 80 percent of the people of this country about the guilt of that defendant , &quot; he said . 
lynch responded by saying : &quot; The only verdict that matters is those 12 people in the jury box . 
those people , somehow , were not convinced . 
in addition to losing the case Garcetti earned the wrath of other staff in his office for giving big bonuses to the high-profile lawyers who unsuccessfully prosecuted Simpson -- Marcia Clark , Christopher Darden and William Hodgman . 
Garcetti also received criticism after two separate juries were deadlocked in the murder trials of the Erik and Lyle Menendez , who shotgunned their wealthy parents in their Beverly Hills home . 
the brothers were convicted at a second trial this year and given life sentences . 
and a string of other high-profile losses have dogged Garcetti since he succeeded IRA Reiner in 1992 : 
-- Four white police officers were acquitted in state court of beating black motorist Rodney King after they were captured on videotape raining blows on him . 
the acquittal sparked deadly street riots in Los Angeles , and two of the men were later convicted in federal court . 
-- A year-long child molestation investigation against pop star Michael Jackson ended in 1994 with no charges filed . 
-- rap star snoop Doggy Dogg and his bodyguard were acquitted of murder earlier this year . 
Erwin Chemerinsky , a law professor at the University of Southern California , said , &quot; I think it is unfair to evaluate ( him ) solely on his handling of one case . 
he should be evaluated on the basis of how he runs the office and not on one atypical case . 
&quot; Overall he &apos;s done a very good job , although some things have occurred that troubled me , &quot; he said without specifying . 
&quot; Unfortunately I think people will vote on the basis of the Simpson case , &quot; said Chemerinsky .
