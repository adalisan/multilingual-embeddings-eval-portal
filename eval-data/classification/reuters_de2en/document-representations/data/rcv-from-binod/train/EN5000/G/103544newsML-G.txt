Russian security chief Alexander Lebed called on Tuesday for closer military cooperation between Russia and NATO within the framework of the alliance &apos;s Partnership for Peace ( PFP ) programme . 
I am sure that in the near future we will be able to organise close cooperation , &quot; Lebed said after during a visit to NATO &apos;s military headquarters . 
Russia last year agreed to join the alliance &apos;s PFP programme , designed to fill the security vacuum in Europe following the collapse of communism , but no progress has since been establishing joint actions envisaged in the programme . 
Alliance leaders have pressed Moscow to move ahead with PFP while negotiations continue on some form of upgraded NATO-Russia relationship , possibly in the form of a charter or treaty . 
Lebed was talking to reporters after being escorted round NATO &apos;s military headquarters by the alliance &apos;s top commander in Europe , U.S. General George Joulwan . 
the two men visited the control room from which the alliance-led peace mission in Bosnia is directed . 
Russia has some 2,000 troops serving in the mission .
