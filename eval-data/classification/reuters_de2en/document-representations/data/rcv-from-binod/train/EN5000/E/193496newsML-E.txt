the U.S. manufacturing sector will likely soften in the fourth quarter as some inventory overhang at the retail level may keep industries from increasing output , Wall Street analysts said . 
higher retail inventory &quot; is going to act as a constraint on production in the fourth quarter , &quot; said Robert Dederick , chief economist at Northern Trust Co . 
the retail inventory accumulation carried over from the third quarter is expected to keep industrial production slow even if consumers decide to return to the stores with gusto for year-end holiday shopping , pundits said . 
&quot; I guess we &apos;re now in the process of liquidating ( the inventory build-up ) and that &apos;s why industrial production is so soft , &quot; said William Griggs , managing director at consulting firm Griggs &amp; Santow Inc . 
a slew of economic reports released on Friday showed that business inventories were up 0.1 percent in September , against a revised 0.3 percent in August . 
analysts said the small increase was due to a drop in wholesale inventories , which fell 1.28 percent . 
a breakdown of the number , however , showed manufacturers &apos; inventories were up 0.3 percent in September versus August , while retailers &apos; holdings jumped 0.84 percent in the period . 
automobile inventory was up a brisk 1.4 percent in the period as major manufacturers increased production on fears of a major strike by U.S. auto workers . 
analysts estimate the economy now has around $ 2.0 to $ 3.0 billion in inventories to liquidate at the manufacturing level and about $ 6.0 to $ 7.0 billion to burn at the retail level . 
&quot; In the wholesale sector you probably don &apos;t have much at all to liquidate , &quot; said an analyst at a U.S. bank who asked not to be named . 
&quot; Most of the problem is in the manufacturing and the retail sectors , &quot; he added . 
industrial production and capacity utilization data released by the Federal Reserve on Friday confirmed Wall Street &apos;s forecast of faltering industrial production . 
October output was down 0.5 percent against a 0.3 percent rise in the previous month . 
capacity utilization slipped to 82.7 percent against 83.4 percent earlier . 
analysts said the report showed a weak reading even though a decline in auto production -- due mostly to a strike at General Motors in Canada , which forced some plants to shut in the U.S. -- was responsible for most of the drop . 
&quot; Ex-auto the number still would &apos;ve been down 0.1 percent , &quot; said Elliott Platt , director of economic research at Donaldson , Lufkin and Jenrette . 
&quot; The numbers suggest businesses probably are ... cutting back production in order to make sure there &apos;s no excess build-up in inventory , &quot; Platt added . 
most analysts said , however , they were not extremely concerned about an inventory overhang problem going into the next year . 
they said they expect consumer spending to pick up in the fourth quarter from the very low levels registered in the third quarter , which may , as a result , clear part of the inventory buildup and prop up some production in the pipeline . 
&quot; I &apos;d think we &apos;re going to be pretty much living out of inventory , production will be on the sluggish side but I think final sales will come back and you &apos;re not going to go into next year with a big problem , &quot; Griggs said .
