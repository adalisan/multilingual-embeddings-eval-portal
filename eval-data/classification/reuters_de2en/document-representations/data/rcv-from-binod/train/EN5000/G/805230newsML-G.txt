Croatia is holding a Bosnian Croat indicted for war crimes and may hand him over to the international tribunal in The Hague , a judge at the Zagreb county court told Reuters on Monday . 
&quot; I know that one ( Bosnian Croat ) is here but I cannot give you the name or anything else , &quot; the judge said . 
he said there were still legal proceedings to go through before the man could be transferred to The Hague . 
a human rights monitor said at the weekend that Croatia was holding at least one of the six men who have been indicted in The Hague for war crimes committed in 1993 in the village of Ahmici in central Bosnia . 
but the most wanted of the suspects , Dario Kordic , who was a high-ranking politician in Croat-controlled Bosnia , was not among them , the monitor said . 
the Hague indictment against Kordic and five others describes attacks on hundreds of Bosnian Moslem houses in villages in the Lasva Valley area of central Bosnia . 
the United Nations in Zagreb said they had not been informed that an indicted suspect was currently in custody . 
speculation is mounting throughout the former Yugoslavia that indicted suspects may be forced to surrender to The Hague or may choose to hand themselves over as international pressure intensifies to get the parties to comply with peace agreements . 
foreign Minister Mate Granic told his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel in Frankfurt on Saturday that the so-called &apos; Vitez group &apos; of seven indicted Bosnian Croats were ready to give themselves up to the tribunal if they were assured of a quick trial .
