Finnish investors are taking a more bearish stance on markka bonds in the second half of 1997 . 
worries over the bumpy run up to the European single currency and the receding outlook for a domestic non-inflationary pay deal for 1998 were unsettling them . 
&quot; There are quite a few uncertainty factors around : the hassle around the EMU process looks set to continue ... U.S. interest rates could come under rising pressures , &quot; said Aarre Sahramaa , fixed income portfolio manager at the Local Government Pension Insitution , one of the country &apos;s biggest investors . 
&quot; For sure ( markka ) bonds will not be in such a hot demand as in the first half , &quot; he said on Tuesday , adding that he would be wary of any further investment in longer maturities . 
in the first five-months of the year , the markka bond market has boomed as investors have had pleanty of cash . 
the state treasury has issued some 22 billion markka ( $ 4.2 billion ) worth of government serial bonds to the market . 
but as bond yields have traded around historical lows this year , Sahramaa said the trend in yields , which rise when bond prices fall , was more likely to turn up than down in the longer-term . 
&quot; I expect the trend in European ( interest ) rates to turn within a year . 
in two years time interest rates could be roughly two percentage points higher , &quot; he said , adding that the Finnish-German yield gap could nevertheless remain steady . 
in the benchmark 10-year maturity , the Finnish yield premium over Bunds has been between 30 and 40 basis points . 
Finnish insurer Pohjola &apos;s portfolio manager Jaana Cawen said there was reason for caution as &quot; bonds had already broken record levels this year &quot; . 
the recurring uncertainties over the timetable for the planned third stage of economic and monetary union ( EMU ) and rising fears of looser entry criteria have caused occasional grief for Finnish bonds and investors said that saga was likely continue in the autumn . 
although the Amsterdam EU summit was seen shedding new light on the EMU process , investors said the Franco-German compromise on the growth and stability pact was a watered-down version of the original package and so pointed to a softer euro currency . 
&quot; In the autumn worries over the soft euro and the ( domestic 1998 ) pay deal will grow , but during the summer the bond market is likely to lie low and bonds will trade in tight ranges , &quot; Cawen said . 
the Paper Workers &apos; Union &apos;s announcement last week that it will not join a comprehensive pay deal next year awoke fears of demands for excessive pay rises . 
Sahramaa said the break-away by the paper workers could be followed by other groups of workers and jeopardize any chance of reaching another comprehensive wage agreement with modest pay hikes to help keep inflation in check . 
but the consensus among investors was that the Bank of Finland would not easily resort to a rate hike -- although it warned on Monday it may have to consider tighter monetary policy if inflation risks grew -- before the Bundesbank made a move . 
&quot; With Finland desperately wanting to be among the core EMU countries , the Bank of Finland &apos;s hands are more or less tied to German monetary policy , &quot; said one investor requesting anonymity . 
but if the broad pay settlement looked set to fall apart , Sahramaa said the central bank could as a last option tighten monetary policy like it did in June 1995 before the autumn wage round . 
the Bank of Finland &apos;s tender rate at 3.00 percent has been on par with the German repo rate since October 1996 . 
investors said they would also be eyeing developments in the United States . 
in the light of recent U.S. economic indicators a rate hike seemed unlikely at the next Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting in July , but June data could already be more inflationary , they said . 
a rate hike in the U.S. would signal a bearish trend for Europe as well . 
&quot; A ( U.S. ) rate hike would dampen investors &apos; faith and prompt selling , &quot; Sahramaa said . 
&quot; But we are in the fortunate position that we can just sit back and wait -- refrain from buying and hope for better times .
