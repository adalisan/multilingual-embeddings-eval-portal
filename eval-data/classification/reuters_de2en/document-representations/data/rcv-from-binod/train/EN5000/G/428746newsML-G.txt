a lawyer for talk show host Jenny Jones was fuming Friday over the release of a videotaped deposition in which Jones said she misled convicted murder Jonathan Schmitz about her fateful show on same-sex secret crushes . 
flamboyant Detroit-area attorney Geoffrey Fieger , who is suing &quot; The Jenny Jones Show &quot; and its producers for $ 25 million in damages on behalf of Scott Amedure &apos;s family , distributed edited excerpts of the 2.5-hour deposition Thursday . 
Schmitz was convicted in November of murdering Amedure in 1995 , three days after Amedure revealed a crush on him during the taping of a &quot; Jenny Jones &quot; segment on same-sex secret crushes . 
in the deposition , Jones said she did not know what Schmitz was told about the show , but said she did not want him to know that his &quot; secret crush &quot; was a man . 
&quot; I cared that he not know , otherwise we wouldn &apos;t have had a show , &quot; Jones said . 
Jones said it was the practice of the show to withhold some information from guests who agree to appear on shows in which they learn on camera the identity of a person who has affections for them . 
&quot; When you do a secret crush show , you don &apos;t give full disclosure , &quot; Jones said . 
Jones said she could remember little about what was said to and about Schmitz in preparation for the show . 
Fieger told the Oakland Press that Jones was a &quot; prevaricating liar . 
&quot; Her ignorance is intentional and preconceived . 
J. Michael Huget , the Detroit attorney who is representing the show and its producer , Warner Brothers &apos; Telepictures productions , said the release of the tape was &quot; highly inappropriate . 
&quot; Fieger &apos;s obviously worried that the case will not stand up in court , so he has to resort to selectively edited soundbites , &quot; Huget said . 
Huget said he intends to prove that Schmitz was responsible for his own actions . 
&quot; We intend to show that from Schmitz &apos; own actions , he knew his crush could be a man or a woman and he willingly came on the show with this knowledge , &quot; Huget said .
