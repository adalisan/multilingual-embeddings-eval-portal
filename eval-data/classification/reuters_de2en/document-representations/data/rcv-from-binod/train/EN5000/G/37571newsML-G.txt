Simpson knew he would be cleared of killing his ex-wife the night before the verdict was announced and faked his look of surprise in court , according to the author of a new book on the criminal trial . 
new Yorker magazine writer Jeffrey Toobin told a television interviewer Simpson learned in advance from a jail guard of the jury &apos;s decision to find him not guilty . 
&quot; One of the things I &apos;ve learned since the trial is that one of the most famous moments in television history , which is that shot of O.J. , is fundamentally a fraud , &quot; Toobin said in excerpts of an interview released before broadcast on NBC News &apos; &quot; Dateline Sunday &quot; on Sept . 8 . 
a Los Angeles jury found Simpson not guilty on Oct . 3 , 1995 of stabbing to death his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in June 1994 but he still faces a wrongful death civil trial starting Sept . 17 . 
the former football star is being sued by the families of the murder victims , who allege he is responsible for their deaths . 
Toobin , whose book is called &quot; The run of His Life , &quot; said the jurors reached their verdict on the night of Oct . 2 and had a party during which they told Los Angeles sheriffs guarding them that the verdict was not guilty . 
one of the sheriffs called a friend who was guarding Simpson and told him , Toobin said in the interview . 
&quot; One of the sheriffs came up to him ( Simpson ) and said &apos; I want your autograph tonight because you &apos;re going home tomorrow . 
&apos; Simpson said &apos; what ? 
&apos; , &quot; Toobin said . 
he quoted the sheriff as saying &quot; We know . 
jury voted to acquit .
