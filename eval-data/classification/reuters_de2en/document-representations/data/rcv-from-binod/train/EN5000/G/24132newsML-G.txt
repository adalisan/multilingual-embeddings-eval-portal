Russia &apos;s security tsar Alexander Lebed flew on Friday to rebel Chechnya for talks with local separatists during which he hopes to sign a framework document on how to define its future status , Interfax news agency said . 
Itar-Tass news agency said that before his departure Lebed had spoken by telephone to President Boris Yeltsin , who is on holiday outside Moscow . 
Interfax quoted Lebed &apos;s press secretary as saying he aimed at reaching &quot; sweeping agreements &quot; at the current stage of talks but adding that the rebels might need some time to consider Moscow &apos;s proposals . 
the spokesman gave no details of the draft plan but said it dealt with political aspects of the conflict -- the most sensitive issue in the 20-month-old war in which more than 30,000 people have been killed . 
Interfax said Lebed &apos;s trip would last one day and he would fly first to the capital of the neighbouring region of Dagestan and then move to the separatist region by helicopter . 
Lebed has been seeking in vain a meeeting with Yeltsin to get his approval for the peace plan but the Russian leader stays out of the public eye and receives no visitors at his country residence . 
this has triggered speculation about his health .
