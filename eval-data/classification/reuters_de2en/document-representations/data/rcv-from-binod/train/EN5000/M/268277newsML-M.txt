Dutch money market rates were mostly glued to Wednesday &apos;s levels in slow trade on Thursday , ignoring several Bundesbank announcements . 
&quot; The Buba &apos;s decision to leave its ( main interest ) rates unchanged did not surprise the market , and although their M3 growth target for the next two years does seem rather low to me , it does not matter much to us , &quot; one dealer said , adding that the actual M3 figures would be carefully watched next year . 
&quot; It &apos;s the results that count , not the targets , &quot; he said . 
the Buba set its M3 growth target for 1997 and 1998 at 3.5 to 6.5 percent , bringing it down from the current four to seven percent , which has been continuously surpassed this year . 
it also announced it kept its main discount , Lombard and repo rates unchanged , as expected by market players . 
trade was again slow due to the end-of-year effect . 
&quot; The ( money ) market will lay backwards till January , &quot; one dealer said . 
he said most activity was concentrated in call money and up to the end of December . 
one to three month deposits were quoted slightly higher than yesterday ( 3.02-3.10 ) , but were not very active , dealers said . 
&quot; There are some parties keen on buying over the year-end , but no sellers . 
the rates for these deposits are below what I consider as realistic , &quot; one dealer said . 
the guilder was quoted at 112.240 per 100 marks , virtually unchanged from yesterday ( 112.235 ) .
