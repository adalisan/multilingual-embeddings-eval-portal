Croatian interbank call money rates remained mostly unchanged on Wednesday , dealers said , and the trend of mostly call money loans being granted continued . 
&quot; For the first time in a while we have had some money left over on the supply side , &quot; a dealer told Reuters . 
fresh loans totalled 31 million kuna out of which all but one were call money loans granted at a steady 10.5 percent rate . 
some ten million kuna was left on the supply side . 
Tuesday &apos;s overnight trade totalled 156 million kuna with one bank seeking funds to cover its shortfalls and the rest being used by banks to maintain their mandatory reserves . 
the dealer said the main reason there was more overnight trade that usual was that funds were granted at a lower rate than usual .
