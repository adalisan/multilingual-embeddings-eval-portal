new Jersey Gov. 
Christine Whitman said increased state intervention in Camden &apos;s finances would not lead to a takeover of the city , the Philadelphia Inquirer reported Wednesday . 
the state &apos;s Department of Community Affairs is examining whether a special board could be established to work with the mayor and city council on policy decisions . 
a decision on such a board could be announced as early as next month . 
but Whitman said the review is not a step toward a full-scale state takeover of the cash-strapped city , according to the newspaper . 
Camden has yet to submit a balanced budget for fiscal 1997 , which ends on June 30 . 
the city is trying to close a $ 796,000 deficit in the $ 100 million spending plan .
