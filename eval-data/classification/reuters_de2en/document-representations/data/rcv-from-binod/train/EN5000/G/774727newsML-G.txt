thousands of German soldiers and volunteers on Sunday worked feverishly to bolster sodden dikes on the Oder river and for the first time officials said they were hopeful of winning the battle to hold the dam . 
helicopters flew tonnes of sand and gravel from a central landing area to weak spots in the dike in the Oderbruch basin near the villages of Hohenwutzen , Reitwein and Zollbruecke , where soldiers have toiled day and night to save the dike . 
should the dike break , which officials say is still possible , water would flood the Oderbruch basin , an area 17 km ( 11 miles ) wide and 50 km ( 30 miles ) long on Germany &apos;s frontier with Poland , engulfing villages , farms and factories . 
&quot; On the 17th day of the catastrophe it appears as if we are coming out of the defensive , &quot; said Brandenburg state premier Manfred Stolpe in Frankfurt an der Oder . 
Brandenburg environment minister Matthias Platzek , during a visit to one of the massive repair sites at the dike near Hohenwutzen , also appeared optimistic . 
&quot; I believe we might be able to hold the dikes , &quot; he said . 
while officials emphasised that water levels must fall further before there is no longer any immminent danger of a break in the dike , they have never been so upbeat since the Oder river began rising dangerously nearly three weeks ago . 
while soldiers laboured in the muddy fields of wheat and sunflowers near Hohenwutzen , dozens of mothers and grandmothers from the village spent the night baking and surprised soldiers with a gift of cake and coffee at the foot of the dike . 
further south in Ratzdorf , where the Oder and Neisse rivers that form Germany &apos;s eastern border meet , water levels have been falling steadily . 
but the river must fall over one metre ( yard ) further to ease the pressure on the water-logged dikes . 
Germany has escaped the worst of a month of flooding that killed more than 100 people in Poland and the Czech Republic , but damage to homes , businesses and farms has been extensive . 
what has saved the dike in the vulnerable Oderbruch region has been a massive deployment of muscle and machinery by the army that has quickly reinforced every break in the dam , and the spirit of local villagers refusing to give up their homes to what has seemed like inevitable destruction . 
the battle to save the dikes has brought east and west Germans closer together , seven years after unification , and has driven home to many east Germans what they have gained since dumping the communist regime in 1989 . 
&quot; Those of us who spent forty years in East Germany never had it as good as those in the West , &quot; said Magdalena Schroeder , 63 , of Hohenwutzen . 
&quot; We learned how to help one another because we had to , and that is just what we are doing now . 
but the westerners brought their technology along with the soldiers and if they hadn &apos;t we would have been under water a long time ago .
