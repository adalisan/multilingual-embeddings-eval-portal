Chinese copper consumption is likely to sharply exceed most estimates , eroding stocks and pushing prices to $ 1.30 per lb ( $ 2,866 per tonne ) by the end of this year , a report by Bankers Trust said . 
&quot; There is ample evidence to suggest that there will be significant upward pressure on the copper price during 1997 and particularly 1998 , &quot; it said . 
prices should reach $ 1.45 / lb ( $ 3,197 / tonne ) by the end of 1998 . 
demand for the metal in China in recent years has probably been greatly underestimated and intensity of use will rise in the future , Bankers Trust said . 
most estimates of Chinese copper use have been too low due to the difficulty of tracking an economy that has been growing at about 10 percent per year over the past 15 years . 
official surveys may be missing the growing private sector . 
&quot; CNNC ( China National non-ferrous metals Industry Corp ) estimates its coverage of the 10 non-ferrous metals to now account for 65 to 68 percent of total annual outputs , &quot; the report said . 
an analysis by Bankers Trust of Chinese GDP and industrial production as well as microeconomic components which use copper are at odds with the official rate of copper consumption and add weight to the argument that demand has been underestimated , it added . 
copper intensity of use should rise in coming years since most of government restrictions on copper consumption imposed during the 1980s have been lifted , the Five Year plan targets many industries which are big copper users , and the introduction of the Shanghai and Shenzen Metal Exchanges have boosted private sector trade . 
bankers Trust estimates consumption in 1997 at 1.621 million tonnes and 1.862 million in 1998 , placing the market in a deficit of 210,000 tonnes this year and 472,000 tonnes next year . 
most analysts believe the market will show a surplus by the end of the year as new mines come on stream and swamp the market . 
&quot; Bankers Trust is expecting stocks to decline to 2.6 weeks consumption in 1997 and further to 0.4 weeks of consumption in 1998 . 
such a stock position would clearly cause a sharp upward move in the copper price which is likely to be accompanied by a high degree of volatility , &quot; the report said . 
&quot; Our assessment of the global stock-to-consumption ratio sharply diverges from the current market outlook , &quot; it added . 
the demand pressure should continue into 1999 , which will leave the market in deficit and the copper price at least at $ 1.35 / lb ( $ 2,976 / tonne ) .
