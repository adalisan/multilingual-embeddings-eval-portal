the Spanish government has resumed talks with GRAPO Marxist guerrillas to negotiate the group &apos;s dissolution and stop its violent activities , an Interior Ministry spokesman said on Monday . 
the talks with jailed GRAPO leaders , which began in February under the previous Socialist administration , had been on hold during the transition to a conservative government . 
the spokesman confirmed that talks had resumed , but refused to comment on progress saying they needed to be conducted with the &quot; maximum possible discretion . 
prison officials said the jailed members of GRAPO , the October First Anti-Fascist Resistance Group , were &quot; sick of prison &quot; and willing to negotiate . 
some have been in prison for 20 years . 
they are looking to legalise GRAPO &apos;s political arm -- the outlawed Communist Party of Spain-Reconstituted ( PCE-R ) , a splinter group of the official and recognised Communist Party of Spain -- and to get the prisoners pardoned . 
officials quoted in Spanish newspapers said there had been many contacts between military intelligence agents and the prisoners and the talks were going well . 
&quot; There could be results , or even an accord , in days or weeks , &quot; an unamed source from the Interior Ministry told daily newspaper El Pais . 
the main sticking point is a dispute over a businessman from Aragon , Publio cordon , who was kidnapped on June 27 , 1995 . 
GRAPO says the group released him on August 17 , 1995 after the family paid a 390 billion peseta ( $ 3 billion ) ransom in Paris , where the outlawed PCE-R is based . 
the government and the family insist he is still being held . 
GRAPO was active mainly in the early years of Spain &apos;s transition to democracy in the late 1970s . 
it killed some 80 people in an effort to overthrow the Spanish government and establish a Marxist state . 
most of its member are in jail but a small number still stage occasional shows of force .
