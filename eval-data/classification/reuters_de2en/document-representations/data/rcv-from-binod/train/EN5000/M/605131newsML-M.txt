shares on the Lima stock exchange closed Thursday with solid gains as a record bull run in the mining sector provoked investors to buy other leading stocks whose prices were relatively cheap , brokers said . 
the trend is likley to continue Friday , they added . 
the General Index rose 2.13 percent to 2,007.7 , while the blue-chip Selective Index climbed 1.55 percent to 2,931.2 , according to preliminary figures given at the market &apos;s close at 1330 local time ( 1830 GMT ) . 
the market &apos;s bull run this month , which has been based on a fast-growing economy and high interest in polymetallic miners due to elevated zinc prices , lifted the General Index past the 2000 mark for the first time today . 
in a total of 2,367 trades , volume was a healthy 43.0 million soles ( $ 16.2 million ) , brokers said . 
&quot; Given various positive factors , the market will keep seeing rises , &quot; Manuel Torres of local brokerage Finvest said . 
&quot; The zinc price has given , and will continue to give , mining stocks a boost . 
and , then , the economy is getting stronger all the time , and this is pushing up the industrial sector . 
the country &apos;s leading bank , Banco de Credito , attracted strong interest , soaring 7.3 percent to 5.00 soles on volume of 662,000 shares . 
Peru &apos;s largest brewery group Union de Cervecerias Peruanas Backus y Johnston SA recorded strong gains for the second consecutive session , jumping 3.45 percent to 2.40 soles on volume of 262,000 shares . 
polymetallic miner Atacocha continued its rise , climbing 10.23 percent to 2.37 soles on heavy volume of 2.0 million shares . 
but Morococha &apos;s series of steep rises was interrupted as the miner gained a modest 0.45 percent to close at 6.69 soles on 438,000 shares .
