U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke to Saudi Arabia &apos;s King Fahd by telephone on Saturday as U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry headed to the Gulf to try to secure Arab support for a possible military showdown with Iraq . 
the official Saudi Press Agency said the two leaders discussed bilateral ties . 
it did not give further details . 
Perry &apos;s tour of the region is due to include stops in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia , launch pad for the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War . 
Saudi Arabia has tried to distance itself from the latest military strikes against Iraq . 
the kingdom has said it would have refused to give the U.S. access to its bases for last week &apos;s missile attacks on Iraq had such a request been made . 
Iraq declared on Friday it would &quot; suspend &quot; its missile attacks on U.S. and allied aircraft policing no-fly zones over Iraq but Clinton ordered 5,000 more troops to Kuwait and sent Perry on his regional tour .
