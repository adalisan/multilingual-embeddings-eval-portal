the lower house of the Belarussian parliament , created after a controversial referendum last November , on Friday unanimously backed a newly-signed integration deal with Russia . 
&quot; This gives us hope for a proper life for the fraternal Slav peoples , &quot; Leonid Rachkov , chairman of the chamber &apos;s international affairs commission , told the house . 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and hardline Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko signed the deal formalising a loose union between the two former Soviet republics a week ago . 
the deal was a watered-down version of the original draft , amended last month after liberals in the Russian government warned it could give Lukashenko too much power and damage Russia by linking it with its poorer and less reformed neighbour . 
speaking before all 85 deputies voted in favour of the deal , Rachkov said it had been made possible by the referendum , in which Lukashenko won sweeping new powers and which some western institutions have noted was widely seen as illegitimate . 
&quot; This event is connected with the hard period of last year when we ... after the referendum , started constitutional reform and hastened this development , &quot; Rachkov said . 
the old parliament , swept aside by Lukashenko after the referendum , has been reduced to criticising his authoritarian rule through the opposition media but has no real influence . 
opposition activists refuse to recognise the new parliament and are fiercely opposed to the integration deal , which they say is a sell-out of Belarussian interests . 
the opposition says it will not protest against the deal &apos;s ratification because it considers it null and void . 
but some young opposition activists are expected to hold a rally on Friday near the central bank headquarters protesting against the union with Russia and commemorating clashes near the bank a year ago between police and opposition . 
most Russians and Belarussians , nostalgic for the Soviet Union , support the integration moves between their two states contained in last week &apos;s charter , and the outline Union Treaty signed on April 2 . 
the lower house of Russia &apos;s parliament is expected to give its assent to the documents in a vote scheduled for June 6 . 
the upper house of the new Belarussian parliament , called the Council of the Republic and packed with Lukashenko &apos;s allies , decided to vote on the deal on June 11 , at the same time as Russia &apos;s upper house .
