South African President Nelson Mandela , 78 , said on Monday he was in good health and challenged a reporter to a boxing match to prove the point . 
Mandela cancelled an official appointment on Friday and set aside several days to rest ahead of a visit to the Indian sub- continent . 
the president on Monday had a 30-minute meeting with Diana , Princess of Wales , and reporters asked him afterwards about his health . 
&quot; My health is fine . 
do you want to challenge me ? 
&quot; he asked , raising his fists to Spar . 
Mandela was a keen amateur boxer in his youth . 
last year unsubstantiated rumours about his health sent the rand into a slide against the dollar and other major currencies . 
the currency has since recovered some of its sharp losses .
