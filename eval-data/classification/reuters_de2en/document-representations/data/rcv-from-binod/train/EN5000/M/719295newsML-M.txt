heavily oversold London Metal Exchange ( LME ) copper prices edged up slightly in Asian trade on Thursday , but technically the market remains very weak and could be heading for $ 2,100 if support at $ 2,200 cracks , dealers said . 
&quot; The current copper market shows further weakness on technical factors even though it is extremely oversold , &quot; a trader with a local LME brokerage firm said . 
the trader said a chart gap between $ 2,308 and $ 2,365 seemed to be a runaway gap , which is also called a measuring gap . 
the runaway gap is a sign of weakness in a down trend and usually occurs at about the halfway point in the trend . 
&quot; The target of the current downward move is estimated at $ 2,100 a tonne , &quot; the trader added . 
but he said there was strong support at $ 2,200 a tonne as technically copper prices need a corrective bounce to reduce the market &apos;s oversold position . 
the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) for three-month copper fell to 21.88 percent on Wednesday from 33.44 percent the previous day . 
the market generally considers an RSI of 70 or more as overbought and 30 or less as oversold . 
LME broker Brandeis also said in its daily report the technical outlook for copper was poor after prices gapped sharply lower on the charts . 
Wednesday &apos;s close indicated a test of support around $ 2,200 / $ 2,210 and then at $ 2,185 , it said . 
dealers said heavy deliveries of physical copper from China and South Korea were also depressing the market . 
but they said possible Chinese buying , expected to emerge later in the second half of this year , could bolster copper . 
&quot; A further slide of three-month copper prices to below $ 2,200 a tonne is likely to lure Chinese buyers back to the market in the second half of this year , &quot; one dealer said . 
dealers said the copper market continued to shrug off production stoppages as a seasonal consumer slowdown in Europe and the U.S. was also beginning to affect order books . 
Sterlite Industrial &apos;s 100,000 tonnes a year copper smelter in India has been shut down since Sunday due to a suspected gas leak . 
activity at the Neves Corvo copper mine in southern Portugal was paralysed for the third day running on Wednesday as miners continued to strike over working hours . 
broker Brandeis said the 10-day moving average of three-month zinc prices was providing good support at $ 1,448 a tonne . 
resistance was seen at $ 1,470 , although there is a gap to be filled between $ 1,445 and $ 1,443 on the charts . 
Brandeis said support was seen at about $ 1,540 / $ 1,5030 , with immediate resistance at $ 1,565 / $ 1,570 .
