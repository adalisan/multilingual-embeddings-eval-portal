Northern Ireland &apos;s peace talks were finally set to get off the ground on Tuesday after political parties made the first breakthrough in four months of wrangling and set a basic agenda . 
the first substantive negotiation was to be held later in the day against a background of renewed tension across the British province caused by a week-old IRA guerrilla attack on Britain &apos;s army base at Lisburn , south of Belfast . 
the talks group all Northern Ireland &apos;s pro-British and pro-Irish parties except Sinn Fein , excluded because of the failure of its IRA guerrilla allies to renew a 17-month ceasefire . 
this means parties will discuss ways to get guerrilla groups to surrender their weapons while the Irish Republican Army , whose war against British rule lies at the heart of the conflict , is not represented . 
progress was seen deepening the isolation of Sinn Fein , whose IRA allies reject any preconditions for talks and refuse to discuss dismantling their arms stockpiles . 
but it would enhance the credentials of two small political parties representing the IRA &apos;s arch-foes , Loyalist groups who waged a 27-year war of terror against the Catholic community to avenge IRA attacks , delegates said . 
Loyalist militia have so far stuck by a two-year-old ceasefire and have not retaliated for last week &apos;s IRA bombing of the Lisburn base , the first IRA attack in Northern Ireland itself for two years . 
their spokesmen in the Progressive Unionist Party ( pup ) and Ulster Democratic Party ( UDP ) , drawn into the political process for the first time in years , have appealed to the guerrillas not to wreck fragile hopes of peace by avenging the IRA attack . 
delegates said the breakthrough was made possible by agreement between seven out of nine parties on how to tackle the surrender of arms held by guerrilla groups , the issue which has dogged an Anglo-Irish peace process for two years . 
but the issue remained theoretical because both the IRA and Loyalist guerrillas have said disarmament can only take place as part of an overall settlement reconciling pro-British Unionist and Irish nationalists . 
the parties will discuss how guerrilla groups could carry out so-called decommissioning of their arsenals in stages as the talks progress , an idea first floated by their U.S. chairman , former Senator George Mitchell . 
&quot; As a result of this agreement there will be substantive discussions on decommissioning at an early date , &quot; David Trimble , leader of the Ulster Unionist Party ( UUP ) , the main voice of continued British rule , told reporters . 
the talks have been bogged down since they were launched by Britain and Ireland in June under the chairmanship of Mitchell , U.S. President Bill Clinton &apos;s Ireland adviser . 
unionist parties , which want the province to stay British , suspected Mitchell of favouring their Irish nationalist rival , the Social Democratic and Labour Party ( SDLP ) . 
they sought to rewrite the terms of his chairmanship and define the rules of procedure in moves which prevented any discussion at all of Northern Ireland &apos;s future until now .
