the Australian dollar went slack at the midsession as early efforts to shoulder aside US $ 0.7535 resistance went the same way as every other attempt recently . 
traders said a late short squeeze had come courtesy of bids from just two banks and there was a resounding lack of follow-through buying when the local market opened . 
instead offers on AUD / yen trickled out of Tokyo and the dollar was soon losing ground on the crosses as well . 
the rebuff reaffirmed the strength of the US $ 0.7470 / 7540 range which has confined the currency for the last week or more and left dealers despairing on the chances of a breakout in the short term . 
support was seen at 75 cents and more importantly around last week &apos;s floor at US $ 0.7470 . 
on the crosses it had slid to 85.77 / 87 yen from 86.63 / 78 late Monday , tracking the U.S. dollar which sagged more than a yen to 114.10 by the midsession . 
the initial dollar weakness was caused by comments from Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto urging the U.S. to cooperate on stabilizing exchange rates . 
if the dollar were too weak , Hashimoto said , Japan might be tempted to sell its holdings of treasuries and buy gold . 
treasuries slid in response and Wall Street dived 2.47 percent as investors took profits . 
Hashimoto later moved to repair the damage issuing a statement through the MOF that his remarks were misinterpreted and Japan had never sold treasuries in the past because of the over-riding importance of the U.S.-Japan relationship . 
however , dealers said the dollar &apos;s initial fall had already triggered stop loss sales by then which swamped any improvement in sentiment the correction may have engendered . 
a lack of domestic data had the market looking elsewhere for inspiration and some hoped to find it in key Japanese economic figures due Wednesday . 
the Bank of Japan &apos;s Tankan survey of business sentiment is seen as a bellweather of both the econmy and interest rates . 
it is almost an axiom amongst analysts , for instance , that the BOJ would not tighten unless the main diffusion index was positive two quarters in a row . 
this index measuring the sentiment of large manufacturing firms showed a reading of plus 2.0 in the March quarter , the first positive result since November 1991 . 
another positive number would seem , therefore , to fulfill market conditions for a hike in Japan &apos;s record low rates . 
some analysts have revised down their forecasts for the index recently , however , as the aftershock of a VAT hike in April cast a cloud over business sentiment . 
indeed , market rumours abounded today that the index would be quite a bit softer than previously thought . 
median estimates are now for a reading of minus 0.8 but range from minus four to plus four . 
furthermore , the volatility caused by the VAT change -- seen in everything from retail sales to exports -- made the index less reliable than usual . 
incidentally , the main diffusion index has a good historical correlation with the Reserve Bank &apos;s commodity price index reflecting Japan &apos;s position as the largest single consumer of Australian commodities . 
a sustained recovery in the index therefore , should be positive for the A $ over time even if it meant Japanese interest rates might also be nudged higher . 
the Tankan survey also includes important readings in the real economy such as manufacturer &apos;s plans for capital investment and employment intentions , which may be more useful than the main index itself .
