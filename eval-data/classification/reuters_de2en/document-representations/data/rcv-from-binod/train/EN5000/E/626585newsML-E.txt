Brazil looks set to post a lower-than-expected trade deficit in May for the first time in months , but economists see few reasons to cheer the result . 
most economists say Brazil should register a $ 200 million trade gap in May , making it the country &apos;s lowest deficit in more than seven months . 
just two weeks ago , a Reuter survey of eight banks and brokerages forecast an average May trade gap of $ 495 million , with estimates ranging from $ 700 million to $ 100 million . 
&quot; So far it looks like May will be better than expected , but this is not enough to conclude everything is O.K. 
and the trend is positive , &quot; said Marcelo Carvalho , chief economist at J.P. Morgan in Brazil . 
the market keeps a close eye on Brazil &apos;s trade picture because a surge in import growth over the past two years is one of the key factors pressuring the nation &apos;s current account balance of payments deficit . 
Brazil &apos;s current account gap , which was 3.25 percent of gross domestic product last year , is expected to hit 4.25 percent of GDP this year and top 5.0 percent of GDP next year . 
the Ministry of Commerce and Industry released some encouraging news this week when it reported that the month &apos;s trade balance through May 25 showed a deficit of $ 78 million . 
the balance for the entire month was expected next week . 
Fabio Fukuda , an economist at trend Analise , said fewer petroleum imports , lower demand from retailers and the effect of import financing restrictions imposed in March combined to slow imports in May . 
also helping was the fact that the second quarter is a strong export season for Brazil , which harvests its crops in the period . 
despite the anticipated better result in May , economists said they were not revising year-end forecasts . 
J.P. Morgan , for example , still sees Brazil ending 1997 with a $ 13.3 billion trade gap . 
such a result would be significantly higher than 1996 , when Brazil &apos;s trade account closed $ 5.5 billion in the red . 
Brazil &apos;s trade gap for the first four months of 1997 is already over $ 4.0 billion .
