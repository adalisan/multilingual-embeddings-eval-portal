sixty eight French peacekeepers who died while serving in the United Nations mission in former Yugoslavia were honored in an emotional ceremony on Wednesday by their families and fellow officers . 
six families who lost their kin in Bosnia flew from France to Sarajevo to attend a mass at the main cathedral and to dedicate a plaque to the dead soldiers . 
most were killed during a 3-1 / 2 year war in Bosnia . 
the parents of the last to be killed , Captain Gilles Carreau , who died in July 1995 after serving three weeks in Bosnia , said Sarajevo held a special meaning for them . 
&quot; This is the city in which my son lived his last moments . 
his father Jean-Claude , a retired bank clerk , had founded a nation-wide association of parents and friends of victims who took part in intervention in former Yugoslavia ( ANPAVI ) . 
&quot; Today , Sarajevo is more than a name for me . 
it is a passion . 
a plaque with sixty-eight engraved names was erected on Tuesday at the entrance to the Sarajevo airport where three French officers were killed in April 1995 by an artillery shell . 
French peacekeepers controlled the airport throughout the 1992-1997 war which enabled the delivery of the humanitarian aid to beseiged Sarajevo . 
&quot; Nobody should forget this happened , &quot; Jean-Claude Carreau said after the plaque was unveiled . 
NATO peacekeepers replaced U.N. soldiers in Bosnia after the fighting ended with a peace accord in December 1995 . 
several French soldiers serving as NATO peacekeepers have died during the past 16 months in various accidents but not from hostile fire .
