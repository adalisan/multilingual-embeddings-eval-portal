U.S. golfer Tiger Woods was likely to survive the halfway cut of of the Australian Open after an even-par second round on Friday but was still well behind leader Greg Norman , who was five-under when rain stopped play . 
world number one Norman was two holes from completing his second round when rain and failing light left him and 38 others to complete their rounds on Saturday . 
Woods &apos;s 72 on a sodden Australian Golf Club course was completed after an earlier two-hour rain delay and gave him an aggregate seven-over 151 after his opening 79 on Thursday . 
Norman was even with the card for the day after his opening round 67 and led on the course by one shot from Sweden &apos;s Klas Eriksson , who has three holes of his second round left . 
only two players , Rolf Muntz of the Netherlands and Australia &apos;s Rodger Davis , were under par after finishing their second rounds . 
Muntz was on two-under 142 after a 71 and Davis , who described the conditions as the worst he had seen in 22 years as a professional , shot a 72 to be on 143 . 
Woods , 20 , birdied the 17th hole before torrential rain forced players off the course and then returned to negotiate the final hole safely . 
&quot; I &apos;ve always enjoyed playing in bad weather for some reason , &quot; he told reporters . 
&quot; It was pretty brutal out there . 
most of the birds were even walking . 
putting again Woods him down despite a practice session with coach Butch Harmon before his round . 
however , the poor scoring resulting from the bad weather meant he was likely to survive the cut for the top 60 players plus ties . 
Woods was annoyed when an approach shot into a bunker at the 18th robbed him of a birdie chance and a sub-par round . 
Norman , who played a social round with visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday , said he was pleased with his round despite the constant delays . 
despite his disappointing start to the Open , Woods confirmed he would take part in the Australian Masters in Melbourne from February 13 to 16 .
