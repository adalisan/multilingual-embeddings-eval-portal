Argentine stocks slipped off their highs at the close Friday but still mustered strong gains helped by sound turnover , dealers said . 
&quot; The market has clearly regained the initiative thanks to a wave of buying on Wall Street and could tilt further to the upside , &quot; said analyst Jorge Bonanno at Interfin brokers . 
the blue-chip MerVal index index jumped 2.1 percent to 532.26 , boosting gains this week to 4.5 percent . 
floor volume surged to a five-week high of 26.7 million pesos , against 16 million Thursday and a recent daily average of 12 million . 
&quot; The sense we get here is that Wall Street is really driven by electoral factors , perhaps even more than by interest rates these days , and I think the Bolsa is likely to remain conditioned by that trend , &quot; said Bonanno . 
locally , investors will remain anxious to see progress on tax and Labor reforms , dealers said . 
&quot; Things are slowly getting better but for the markets the key word is &apos; slowly , &apos; which means &apos; painful &apos; , &quot; said a trader at a large emerging markets brokerage . 
he said the government is trying to make up for a lack of economic leadership which has kept players guessing for weeks . 
&quot; ( President Carlos ) Menem &apos;s speech yesterday seemed aimed at recovering lost ground , &quot; said the trader , referring to a meeting of ruling Peronist Party leaders Thursday in which Menem made a resounding appeal for unity . 
technical analysts forecast the MerVal would rub up against resistance at 540 early next week and then pull back gently on profit-taking . 
&quot; We should also start to see more selective trading , with investors screening each sector carefully to see how tax hikes and other planned fiscal measures could hurt business and earnings , &quot; Bonanno said . 
in the session the broad market outperformed the MerVal with a 2.4 percent gain . 
winners thrashed losers 50 to 10 and 10 issues closed unchanged . 
over-the-counter deals picked up to 88.3 million pesos from 66.9 million Thursday . 
top MerVal gainers were construction stock Juan Minetti and Banco de Galicia , which charged up 5.1 percent and 4.8 percent , respectively . 
oil giant YPF , the market bellwether , grew a hefty 2.5 percent on news of a leadership change next April , while heavyweights Telefonica and Telecom both rallied 3.0 percent . 
the only MerVal losers were foods giant Molinos , which shed 0.3 percent , and petrochemical concern Ipako , which stumbled 6.0 percent after surging 14 percent Thursday on news it was merging with second-tier holding company Garovaglio . 
Garovaglio , which will absorb Ipako , rocketed 18.6 percent in the session after a 10 percent gain Thursday while Baesa , also a second-line stock , mimicked Thursday &apos;s action with a 10 percent rise driven by reports of a debt restructuring plan .
