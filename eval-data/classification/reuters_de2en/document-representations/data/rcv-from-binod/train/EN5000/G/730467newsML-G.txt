Hungary has made &quot; impressive progress &quot; and is well placed to start European Union membership talks early next year , Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said on Monday . 
speaking after a meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn , Juncker also said the talks , which are expected to begin with up to six applicants , should be based on each country &apos;s performance and not on the group as a whole . 
the EU &apos;s executive Commission agreed in principle last week to recommend the 15-nation bloc opens talks with five central and east European candidates , with Hungary among those closest to meeting the political and economic requirements for joining . 
the proposed list also includes Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovenia and Estonia , as well as Cyprus . 
in December , an EU summit in Luxembourg will decide on the prospective new members and the mechanism for conducting talks , with the possibility of a &quot; waiting-room &quot; system for those left out of the first enlargement wave . 
&quot; We want the enlargement talks to start ... as early as possible in 1998 . 
we want them to be conducted at a firm rhythm ( and ) we have no time to lose , &quot; Juncker , whose country currently holds the EU &apos;s revolving presidency , told a joint news conference with Horn . 
&quot; We would also like these talks to work on the principle of differentiation . 
we will not talk with a group but with each country individually , &quot; he said . 
such an approach could imply that while a group of countries all start membership talks together , they might not all finally be admitted as members at the same time . 
Juncker said it was too soon to say what the December summit would decide on the Commission proposal , adding its evaluations would be studied objectively in the months ahead . 
&quot; Hungary has made enormous progress and is much better prepared than others ... so I rule out that an examination of its application to be a candidate would produce ( any ) surprises , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We contemplate talks with Hungary with optimism . 
he added he did not want to commit himself to a date for the conclusion of the enlargement talks . 
Horn said he had presented Juncker with Hungary &apos;s preparations for the start of enlargement talks , working on the assumption they would begin in early January . 
he said Hungary , together with Poland and the Czech Republic , also wanted to help other countries not in the first wave of EU enlargement , and could swap experiences with them . 
the Commission adopted the recommendation document , Agenda 2000 , without much discussion during a meeting of EU Commissioners in Strasbourg , France , before their formal presentation of the decision to the European Parliament on Wednesday . 
the decision means that other aspiring members -- Latvia , Lithuania , Slovakia , Bulgaria and Romania -- will have to wait , although they will each have contractual accession partnerships allowing them to prepare at their own speed for joining . 
the Commission &apos;s proposal will not be the last word on who will negotiate EU entry , as it could be overturned by EU governments , which have different national interests at stake . 
Horvath said he foresaw no problem in the European Union accepting the Commision &apos;s recommendation in the case of Hungary . 
&quot; We expect there to be a lively discussion , but in the case of Hungary national parliaments as well as other institutional decision-making bodies of the European Union will not find any areas which will disqualify Hungary from being included , &quot; he said . 
he added that feedback Hungary had received so far regarding a Commission questionnaire it had completed had been &quot; realistic , balanced , as well as overwhelmingly positive &quot; . 
&quot; However , we definitely expect that ( Agenda 2000 ) will point out a few areas in which we will have to work , &quot; he said . 
Horvath welcomed the inclusion in the Commission &apos;s list of Estonia , a former Soviet republic which along with the other Baltic states of Lithuania and Latvia failed to make the first round of NATO enlargement announced last week . 
&quot; This is the first enlargement round where they are taking in a country from the former Soviet bloc , &quot; he said . 
&quot; By this , the EU is giving a clear indication for openness , for enlargement as well as underlining the chance for all countries who meet the criteria to qualify for starting accession talks .
