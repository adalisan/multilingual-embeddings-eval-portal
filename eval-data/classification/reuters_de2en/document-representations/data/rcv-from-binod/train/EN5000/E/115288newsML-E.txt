bilateral trade agreements with countries like Zimbabwe and Zambia could not resolve southern African trade inequalities by themselves , Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said on Monday . 
addressing the Commonwealth Press Union &apos;s biennial conference , Mbeki said a regional trade agreement was needed between the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) . 
asked why South Africa was imposing &quot; punitive tariffs &quot; on Zimbabwean textiles while &quot; dumping &quot; its products in neighbouring countries , Mbeki said that before Zimbabwe gained its independence in 1980 , textiles from the former Rhodesia were granted tariff-free access to the South African market . 
&quot; That was part of the system of support that the apartheid regime lent the colonial regime in Zimbabwe , &quot; he said . 
this system changed before the African National Congress-led government was elected in South Africa , he said . 
Mbeki added , &quot; we are sensitive to the impact of this on the textile industry in Zimbabwe &quot; . 
two months ago a clthing and textile agreement was reached between South Africa and Zimbabwe after extensive negotitations . 
Zambia is currently pressing for a similar trade agreement . 
in August SADC states initiated a trade protocol in Lesotho and the ministers were instructed to work out details and meet again in six months . 
issues needing to be addressed include weak customs controls in South Africa , which allow large volumes of illegal imports . 
some countries import clothing and textiles &quot; from elsewhere &quot; , label them as locally made and export them to South Africa , Mbeki said . 
he said that South Africa was also aware that it had to consider the possible impact on neighbouring countries of its planned free trade area with the European Union . 
turning to crime , Mbeki said that the new government had inherited a &quot; very difficult &quot; situation . 
&quot; Perhaps we did not quite understand the depth of the crisis this country was in , &quot; he said . 
part of the problem was that although the previous government had developed a strong security police service to deal with political crime , it had resulted in poor criminal intelligence units , he said . 
asked whether South Africa was considering anti-trust legislation , Mbeki said the government was not so much concerned about the size of corporations , but that &quot; the preponderance of market power should not be used in order to limit competition .
