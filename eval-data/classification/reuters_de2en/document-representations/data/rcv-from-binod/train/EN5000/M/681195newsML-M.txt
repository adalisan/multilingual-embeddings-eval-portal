U.S. Plains feedlot cattle early Monday were bid lightly at $ 63.00 per cwt and passed by owners pricing cattle at $ 65.00 , feedlot sources said . 
&quot; Today is going to be an inventory day , with the packer out looking around and checking his inventory , but I don &apos;t expect to see any trading , &quot; a Kansas feedlot operator said . 
Feedyards were current following last week &apos;s moderate to active trade at $ 64.00 , several sources said . 
the price was up $ 1.00 from the previous week . 
outlooks for firm prices this week were fueled by quick delivery of cattle sold last week , some cattle feeders said . 
the quick deliveries suggested packers were not too far out front on their inventories , sources said . 
&quot; Over half the cattle sold last week are gone already , &quot; a Kansas source said . 
however , support from the strong packer demand could be offset by outlooks for slower beef buying by retailers as they finish stocking up for Independence Day promotions , the sources said . 
beef prices Friday were quoted down $ 0.16 to $ 0.35 per cwt , with 189 fabricated loads sold , USDA reported . 
weekly movement totaled 1,080 loads compared with 1,608 a week ago . 
sources said the lower prices and lighter sales reflected the slowdown in holiday-related buying , as most retailers already had booked adequate beef supplies . 
choice beef weighing 700-850 lbs was quoted by USDA at $ 103.44 on Friday , down $ 0.35 from Thursday , the only weakness since the previous Friday , but up $ 5.32 for the week , the statistics showed .
