Bulgaria &apos;s ruling Socialists named current culture minister Ivan Marazov as their new bid in the October 27 elections after the Supreme Court blocked the candidacy of Georgi Pirinski two days ago , officials said on Wednesday . 
art historian Marazov started the campaign with Pirinski as his vice-presidential candidate . 
Marazov , 54 , was nominated during a night meeting of the Bulgarian Socialist Party ( BSP ) high council , composed largely of former communists . 
&quot; Marazov seemed an appropriate choice as he is already familiar to our supporters from the election campaign with Pirinski , which started last month , &quot; said a BSP pressofficer . 
Marazov will be flanked by deputy foreign minister Irina Bokova as vice-presidential nominee . 
Bokova was responsible for relations with the European Union . 
Bulgaria &apos;s Supreme Court on Monday blocked the presidential candidacy of Socialist Georgi Pirinski on the grounds that he was born and spent his early childhood in the United States . 
Pirinski , current foreign minister , was born in New York in 1948 of a Bulgarian father and American mother . 
his family moved in the mid-1950s to Bulgaria where Pirinski made a career in the old ruling communist party . 
but the Bulgarian Supreme Court upheld a ruling by the Central Electoral Commission ( CEC ) that Pirinski , who has a Bulgarian passport , be disqualified from the presidential race because he was not born in Bulgaria . 
the constitutional court ruled in July that the country &apos;s president must be a Bulgarian citizen by birth . 
BSP officials had believed the father &apos;s nationality would be sufficient to determine Pirinski junior was also a Bulgarian . 
&quot; Marazov is a reasonable choice . 
presidential candidates can submit papers and amendments to their applications in CEC until September 22 . 
the Supreme Court is expected to rule later on Wednesday on CEC &apos;s refusal to register the presidential candidate of the anti-communist opposition because of legal inconsistencies . 
Petar Stoyanov , a lawyer who beat incumbent President Zhelyu Zhelev in Europe &apos;s first primary election in June , has had difficulties in having his application papers signed after one of the opposition coalition of parties backing him , sacked its leader .
