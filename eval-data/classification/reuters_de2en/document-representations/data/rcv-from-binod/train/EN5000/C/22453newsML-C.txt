Dutch-Belgian insurance group Fortis said on Thursday it wants to expand its businesses worldwide through both acquisition and organic growth , particularly in the life insurance and investment sectors . 
&quot; We do have an external growth strategy and we want to build another strong base in Europe ; we want to expand in the U.S. and in the longer term we would like to build a position in Asia as well , &quot; director Saskia van Opijnen told Reuters in a telephone interview from Utrecht . 
Fortis earlier announced a 21 percent increase in first half profits to 366 million ecus . 
analysts had forecast Fortis , which is equally-owned by Fortis Amev and Fortis AG , to report a net profit of between 341 million and 371 million ecus . 
Yvette Van der Schaaf , director group reporting , said any acquisitions must meet the group &apos;s criteria of 12 percent return on equity per annum and seven to 12 percent growth in earnings per share . 
she did not rule out acquisitions in any area , but added , &quot; We like life and investment , where it &apos;s profitable of course ... It depends on performance and price . 
in Europe , Fortis &apos; main markets are the Netherlands , Belgium and to a lesser extent Spain . 
in the UK Fortis has a non-life operation and in France a life company . 
in the U.S. , Van der Schaaf said Fortis was taking measures to tackle the disappointing performance of its life business , which was in part due to cyclical factors . 
&quot; We are being very selective about what lines we want to be in and the way we handle them , &quot; she added . 
Fortis United States reported a 10 percent fall in operating profits to 45 million ecus . 
the health insurance result remained in the red but was up on the first quarter , the company said . 
apart from improving existing U.S. operations , van Opijnen said Fortis was also looking at acquisitions &quot; if attractive files present themselves . 
in Asia , Fortis currently has only a small participation in Singapore . 
&quot; Our ideas there are really very long term , so we don &apos;t have any specific ideas right now , &quot; Van der Schaaf said , adding that there were no specific targets for geographical spread . 
&quot; We want to have a spread over different cycles and different products , but we don &apos;t have a specific philosophy of wanting such a percentage in Asia or in Europe and so on . 
&quot; That depends on developments and opportunities , &quot; Van der Schaaf added . 
on the banking side , where the group continued to perform well , it is still looking for an acquisition in the Netherlands . 
&quot; In the Netherlands we clearly need to grow . 
we see several possibilities there , by acquisition if possible , but there has to be a bank which meets the criteria and which is prepared to be acquired , &quot; Van der Schaaf said . 
the outlook for the remainder of the year was positive , Van der Schaaf said , hence the decision to raise the forecast for 1996 earnings per share growth to seven percent . 
&quot; The first half was really better than expected . 
not just in one line ; that actually applies to all lines , with the exception of accident and health , but that was forecast , &quot; she added .
