Turkey &apos;s staunchly secularist army looked set on Monday to pile more pressure on Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan at a key meeting that has paralysed the Islamist-led government . 
the top brass at the extraordinary meeting of the Supreme Military Council were expected to demand that Erbakan approve the expulsion from the army of officers suspected of Islamist tendencies . 
a stern-faced Erbakan sat surrounded by 15 generals and anti-Islamist Defence Minister Turhan Tayan at a table in a pose for television cameras at the start of meeting at military headquarters . 
&quot; This meeting will evaluate domestic and foreign threats directed at Turkey as well as the discipline and moral situations of some Turkish armed forces personnel , &quot; the military said in a short statement . 
newspapers said about 100 officers and non-commissioned officers , most of them accused of being Islamists , were to be drummed out of the army at Monday &apos;s meeting . 
army pressure on Erbakan to curb a rise in Islamist sentiment has exposed serious cracks in the coalition government . 
two MPs from the alliance &apos;s True Path Party secularist wing resigned at the weekend , leaving the government with a majority on paper of only one in the 550-seat parliament . 
three True Path ministers have quit the cabinet in recent weeks in frustration at Erbakan &apos;s failure to comply with army demands for a government crackdown on Islamist activism . 
the Turkish press has reported that True Path leader Tansu Ciller , also the foreign minister , has asked Erbakan to make her prime minister as the only alternative to the government collapsing . 
aides to Ciller , who was Turkey &apos;s first woman prime minister , said her programme of public appearances for the day would become clear only after the military talks had ended . 
none of the major political parties had scheduled any events and stocks in Istanbul were little changed by mid-morning . 
the Hurriyet daily newspaper said the generals would also query Erbakan about the presence of MPs from his Welfare Party at a demonstration in Istanbul earlier this month in favour of Islamist education . 
a cut in religious school education is one of the soldiers &apos; key demands in a proposed return to the strict secularism of the 1920s , when republican Turkey was forged out of the ashes of the Ottoman Empire . 
a prosecutor last week filed a case at the constitutional court for the banning of Welfare for its alleged undermining of Turkey &apos;s secularist principles . 
a Moslem preacher close to Welfare appeared in a security court charged with urging the establishment of sharia Islamic law in a Friday prayers sermon , Anatolian news agency said . 
&quot; This type of speech in a public place like a mosque is not only against the law , it also negatively affects social peace , &quot; the agency quoted a charge sheet read out in court as saying . 
the state-appointed preacher , Ali Kukcuker , works at a mosque in the front courtyard of Welfare &apos;s headquarters in Ankara . 
he faces between one and three years in jail .
