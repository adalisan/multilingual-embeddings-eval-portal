three months of budget surpluses and a surge of privatisation revenues have left some Israeli traders bracing themselves for a tight bond market in the coming months . 
&quot; There are already the first sparks of a tighter supply in the bond market , which is causing yields to fall . 
but we expect an even tighter supply in the coming months , &quot; said Ilan Doron of Solid Financial Markets . 
he said that if the government meets its revenue target of four billion shekels ( $ 1.2 billion ) from privatisations this year , the government would only need to issue 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion shekels in new bonds a month , rather than the norm of 1.8 billion shekels . 
he said the figure could fall to 1.5 billion shekels a month in the final quarter . 
&quot; In the second half of the year we expect there to be seven billion shekels worth of surplus redemptions in the bond market , compared with 1.5 billion shekels in the first half of the year , &quot; Doron said . 
the government has posted budget surpluses over the last three months cutting the deficit to 1.162 billion shekels so far this year . 
the government is targetting a full-year deficit of 9.74 billion shekels . 
in addition , the Treasury is seeking 800 million shekels in budget cuts . 
one reason that the government has contained the deficit is the surge of privatisations in the first half . 
the government sold big blocks of shares Bank Leumi , Israel Discount Bank and Israel Chemicals Ltd . 
but other analysts said they did not expect the government to reduce its fundraising this year . 
one market source , who asked not to be identified , noted that the government was so far only keeping to its targeted privatisation revenues . 
he downplayed the importance of the budget surpluses saying they were not uncommon in the first half of the year and tended to revert to deficits in the second half . 
the government had to date not reduced its debt issues , which have been averaging 1.8 billion to 2.0 billion shekels a month since the beginning of the year , the source said . 
Doron said that if the government does raise less debt the impact will be felt across the market but Danny Alt of Nesuah Trading and Investment said that the impact , if there is one , will be felt mainly in bonds linked to the consumer price index ( CPI ) , which are the Treasury &apos;s main fundraising instrument . 
Doron forecast that yields on CPI-linked bonds , especially long bonds , would fall to around 3.7 percent to 3.9 percent by the end of the year . 
yields are currently 4.0 percent to 4.3 percent . 
&quot; This phenomenon could worsen if Bank Hapoalim is privatised this year , which could reduce issues by two to three billion shekels more by the end of the year , &quot; Doron said . 
Alt said a tighter supply of CPI-linked bonds would not affect the market dramatically . 
&quot; One must remember that there is less demand for CPI-linked bonds because of lower inflation expectations , &quot; he said . 
he added that corporate bonds would pick up any slack from the fewer Treasury issues . 
&quot; Many companies have started issuing convertible bonds to take advantage of the bullish equity market , &quot; Alt said . 
but he agreed that yields have started to fall on CPI-linked bonds because of fears of a tight supply . 
&quot; The big test will be at 4.0 percent , &quot; he said . 
&quot; If yields on CPI-linked bonds fall below 4.0 percent then the impact will be significant , &quot; he said .
