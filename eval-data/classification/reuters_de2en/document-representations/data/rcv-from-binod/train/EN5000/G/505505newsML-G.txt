the Italian government pledged on Sunday to restore Turin &apos;s Renaissance cathedral and an adjoining royal palace to their former glory after a devastating fire wrecked parts of the two buildings . 
experts sifted through the still-smouldering debris to discover how Saturday &apos;s blaze started , while local residents complained that despite recent fires in other historic Italian buildings , Turin cathedral did not have an adequate fire alarm system . 
Pope John Paul said he would honour the firemen who risked searing heat and falling debris to pluck the world famous Turin shroud , one of the most revered relics in the Roman Catholic world , from the dramatic inferno . 
but the baroque Guarini chapel , where the mysterious winding sheet had been housed for centuries , was gutted by the blaze along with a section of the adjoining royal palace . 
&quot; This is the moment to start work so that everything is restored as it once was . 
it is a commitment I make on the part of the government , &quot; Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni said in an interview in the Turin newspaper La Stampa on Sunday . 
early estimates suggest millions of dollars of damage was done by the seven-hour blaze . 
Prime Minister Romano Prodi has called a cabinet meeting for Monday to discuss the situation . 
initial eyewitness accounts suggested that the fire first took hold in the large , ornate chapel at the back of the cathedral , which was under restoration . 
but attention has switched to the adjoining palace , where United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan had attended a gala dinner shortly before the alarm was raised . 
&quot; This is where we have found the highest level of carbonisation and it could therefore be the focal point of the fire , &quot; Serafino Vassalli , deputy chief of the Turin fire service , was quoted as saying by La Repubblica daily . 
newspapers speculated that generators , brought in to provide additional electricity for the gala dinner , might have caused a short-circuit . 
a spokesman for the fire investigation team declined to discuss the speculation . 
&quot; All possibilites are being looked into , nothing has been ruled out , &quot; he said , adding that arson had not yet been excluded . 
a heavy stench of smoke still hung in the air in the centre of this prosperous northern Italian city more than 24 hours after the fire was finally tamed . 
the Turin shroud , a yellowing piece of cloth imprinted with the image of a man &apos;s body that many people take to be the figure of Christ after his crucifixion , was moved to a secret location after its escape from the flames . 
in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo , where the Pope is on a visit , Vatican officials said the Pontiff had decided to honour the firemen who saved the shroud with a special Vatican award . 
&quot; The Pope has decided to confer honours on the chief of the fire service and each one of the firemen who saved the shroud , &quot; said chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls . 
while there was relief in Turin that the shroud was safe , people were also angry that the Guarini chapel did not have a fire alarm system , saying this meant the blaze was well advanced before rescue teams arrived . 
&quot; It shows the lack of care , superficiality and lack of commitment ... perhaps it is not just a ministerial problem but an Italian problem , &quot; La Stampa wrote in an editorial . 
last year a blaze gutted Venice &apos;s famous Fenice opera house while a historic theatre in the southern Italian city of Bari burned down in 1991 . 
investigators believe both fires might have been started deliberately .
