Slovenian bank Hmezad said on Wednesday it expects 1996 net profit to remain barely changed from last year &apos;s 122,316 tolars ( $ 815.4 ) . 
the bank expects profits this year to improve due to the cooperation of business activities between Hmezad and Banka Celje , which recently increased its stake in Hmezad to 40 percent from the previous 15 percent . 
Hmezad last year paid a dividend of 1,400 tolars per share . 
Deputy executive Stana Tilinger told Reuters that balance sheet assets jumped some 20 percent to 10.3 billion tolars ( $ 6.87 million ) in 1996 . 
&quot; Our balance sheet in 1996 grew as a consequence of increased business and the number of clients , &quot; Tilinger said . 
on Wednesday , shares of bank Hmezad were trading 3.91 percent higher at 12,500 tolars on volume of 30 shares .
