coconut oil prices are expected to continue staggering this week , weighed down by the steep fall in soyoil in Chicago and prospects of rising copra and alternative vegetable oil supplies in the region , traders said . 
&quot; But don &apos;t expect active trade this week . 
the market will not be playing with a full deck of cards due to a vegetable oil convention in Budapest , &quot; said a senior trader . 
traders said coconut oil prices may slide further by $ 5 to $ 10 per tonne this week before it stages a technical rally . 
&quot; I expect a sell-off due to the CBOT soyoil news , reports of rising palm production in Kuala Lumpur and coconut oil exports from both the Philippines and Indonesia , &quot; said a foreign dealer in a large commodity house . 
&quot; But a rebound is imminent as export values of coconut oil have dropped between $ 60 and $ 70 per tonne for the last 30 days , &quot; the dealer added . 
coconut oil last traded at $ 655 per tonne for June / July shipment in Rotterdam on Monday , another trader said . 
coconut oil stocks increased to 20,100 tonnes in Rotterdam as of May 12 compared to 17,429 the previous week . 
domestic copra prices also dropped to nine pesos per kg from 10.50 the previous week . 
crude coconut oil dipped to 16 pesos per kg from last week &apos;s 17.30 due to prospects of better Philippine cocout harvests in the second half of the year . 
Philippine coconut products exports in the first four months of the year fell 18 percent to 451,828 tonnes , according to a preliminary report by the United coconut Association of the Philippines . 
the country exported a total of 552,239 tonnes of coconut products in January to April 1996 . 
preliminary data also showed coconut oil exports in the first four months of the year fell 20 percent to 251,604 tonnes against 314,897 in the same period last year . 
but traders expect better export numbers in the second half of the year which historically accounts for 60 percent of the Philippine coconut harvests for the year . 
coconut Oil refiners Association president Jesus Arranza said recently he expected coconut oil exports to rise to between 1.2 and 1.3 million tonnes this year from 813,157 in 1996 .
