U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said a strong dollar increased confidence in U.S. markets and kept interest rates and inflation low . 
answering questions from the audience after a speech to the Investment Company Institute , Rubin said , as he has before , that currencies should not be used as an instrument of trade policy . 
he also repeated the Group of Seven nation &apos;s recent concern that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals . 
Rubin was asked if he was concerned the recent steep rise of the yen would dampen the Japanese enthusiasm for investing in the United States . 
&quot; Two weeks ago people were asking me about the decline of the yen , now they are asking me about the rise of the yen , &quot; he quipped . 
&quot; We don &apos;t sashay around , we have a policy , we believe in it , we follow it , &quot; Rubin said . 
&quot; We don &apos;t adjust ourselves to the day-to-day movements of the markets . 
&quot; I think a strong dollar increases confidence in our markets , which is good for the cost of capital , lowers inflation , lowers interest rates , and that is our policy , &quot; he said . 
Rubin also repeated the concern of Japanese government officials &quot; a little bit ago &quot; about recent movements in the yen &quot; and we said we share their concerns . 
&quot; You put all that together and that is our dollar policy , clearly and crisply articulated for your guidance . 
&quot; You can trade off that if you like , &quot; he said .
