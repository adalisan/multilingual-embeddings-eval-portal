Rwandan businessman Alfred Musema has been transferred from a Swiss jail to face genocide charges before a U.N. tribunal in Tanzania . 
Musema , who was director of a tea factory in Rwanda , was put on a plane bound for the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha on Tuesday , accompanied by two Swiss security officers , federal police spokesman Falco Galli said on Wednesday . 
Musema came to Switzerland seeking political asylum but was arrested in February 1995 on the basis of information from U.N. investigators . 
the Rwandan , from the tiny central African country &apos;s western border region of Kibuye , was indicted by the U.N. tribunal last year on charges of taking part in 1994 &apos;s Hutu-led slaughter of minority Tutsis 
the Swiss Federal Court , based in Lausanne , ruled for the transfer of Musema early this month and rejected his appeal to stay in Switzerland . 
the U.N. tribunal , plagued by widespread mismanagement and financial waste according to a U.N. probe , has indicted 21 people . 
its work has been painfully slow . 
many suspects continue to live freely abroad . 
the tribunal &apos;s maximum penalty is a sentence of life in prison .
