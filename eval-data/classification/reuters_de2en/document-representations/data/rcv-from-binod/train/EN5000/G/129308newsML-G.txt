the Central Intelligence Agency did not have a blueprint for introducing crack cocaine into Los Angeles , according to a published report on Sunday . 
the Los Angeles Times , citing interviews with officials , drug dealers and researchers , said crack cocaine -- a cheap drug created by cooking cocaine with water and baking soda into a rock-like substance -- was already flowing into Los Angeles &apos; gang-ridden neighbourhoods in South Central long before Nicaraguan traffickers arrived on the scene . 
in August , the San Jose Mercury News reported a Nicaraguan drug network , with ties to the CIA-backed contra rebels , allegedly opened up the first cocaine pipelines to Los Angeles . 
however the Los Angeles Times said an investigation into the drug trade found no evidence that any significant drug profits from the Nicaraguan drug ring were sent back to the contras . 
far from the millions allegedly sent , less than $ 50,000 went to the rebel cause , according to a contra supporter quoted by the newspaper . 
the CIA &apos;s alleged involvement in the rise of crack cocaine in Los Angeles has become a hot topic in recent weeks with politicians using it as a campaign issue . 
however , the newspaper said it has not turned up any evidence that the CIA pumped crack cocaine into distressed neighbourhoods in order to fund the contras . 
&quot; This was not some grand design of the drug cartels or someone at CIA headquarters in Langley , va . , who is sitting around thinking up ways to raise money for the contras , &quot; UCLA professor and researcher Ronald Siegel told the newspaper . 
instead , the newspaper said , cocaine was being shipped from Colombia . 
&quot; If there was cocaine being brokered by Nicaraguans , it was not much , &quot; a former Drug Enforcement Agency official in Los Angeles told the newspaper . 
&quot; All the people we saw were Colombians , Colombians , Colombians . 
these guys worked the cocaine from the ton to the kilo . 
CIA director John Deutch told Congress when he ordered a CIA investigation into the issue that he saw no evidence the allegation was true but believed it warranted investigation .
