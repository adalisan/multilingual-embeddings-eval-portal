German shares advanced in tentative bourse trade on Tuesday , buoyed by Wall Street &apos;s overnight gains and quietly confident that an expected U.S. rate hike later today will not exceed 25 basis points . 
the 30-share blue-chip DAX index ended the floor session up 11.41 points at 2,638.45 , its gains supported by a steady dollar and firm Bund futures , but amid moderate volumes . 
attention was firmly focused on the U.S. Federal Reserve &apos;s meeting later today amid broad expectations for a quarter-point rate rise -- an increase dealers said would be moderate enough to avoid panicking markets . 
&quot; We don &apos;t believe anything too dramatic on rates can happen before the ( U.S. November 5 ) election for political reasons . 
on the other hand , something serious could happen after then , &quot; one Frankfurt trader said . 
the dollar , while lower than Monday &apos;s levels , traded comfortably above the 1.5100 level and was seen as offering some support to shares . 
pharmaceuticals group Schering AG gained 3.15 marks to 116.45 on some buying interest after news it was partnering Denmark &apos;s Novo Nordisk in fertility product research .
