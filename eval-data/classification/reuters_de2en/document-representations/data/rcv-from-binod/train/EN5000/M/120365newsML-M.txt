Jordanian stock hovered in narrow range at end of weekly trade on Wednesday with some speculative banking trade behind most of the activity , dealers said . 
the Amman Financial Market 60-share index rose a slight 0.02 percent to 146.75 points from 146.72 points on Tuesday . 
twenty-two stocks declined against only six advancing and 18 closed unchanged . 
brokers said the Jordanian stock exchange , highly sensitive to Middle East peace moves , was still in a wait-and-see mood that is keeping investors on the sidelines , awaiting outcome of Israeli-Palestinian talks . 
&quot; It &apos;s speculative trade by holders of stock to achieve profit either in downward or upward trade that has characterised trade in otherwise very thin activity , &quot; one broker said . 
a bloc trade involving one million shares in the Middle East Complex , manufacturer of under license Korean Goldstar consumer electrical goods , accounted for the overall healthy 1.3 million dinar turnover of both the official and primary market . 
with a turnover of 690,703 dinars , the key industrial stock shed 0.01 dinars to 0.66 dinars . 
the market has been dogged lately by an impasse in Palestinian-Israeli talks and growing doubts that neighbouring Iraq will be able to sell oil before the end of the year . 
brokers say the Central Bank &apos;s high interest rates policy has dampened investment by institutional investors , including banks , in the market . 
banks , who have shunned the market in favour of higher yield instruments , are waiting on the sidelines further adding to the woes of the cash-short exchange , dealer say . 
select bank shares dominated with two stocks , Philadelphia Investment Bank and Middle East Investment Bank eyed by investors focusing on their coming capitalisation issues to meet Central Bank requirements by year-end . 
brokers cited rumoured foreign investor interest in the planned capital hikes by both banks as motivating some of the current speculative buying still mainly undertaken by floor traders . 
PHIB shares rose 0.060 dinars to 1.37 dinars in large 136,639 dinar turnover while MEIB shares shed 0.04 dinars to 1.10 dinars after trade worth 27,550 dinars . 
brokers said long-term holders of Livestock and Poultry , who saw their shares fall by a third in the last two weeks , were behind persistent speculative trade trying to prop it up . 
but the stock which saw more selling than buying pressure on Wednesday was unchanged at 0.64 dinars after trade worth 25,547 dinars . 
the private Pearl Investable Index of the 45 best performing shares on the exchange shed 0.05 percent to 80.67 points from 80.71 points , 15.54 percent down from the same time last year . 
a total of 1,119,000 shares worth 729,918 dinar changed hands in healthy trade in the parallel market .
