marketing of products on the Internet is carving a larger niche in the German market and is the most important new trend in direct marketing , an industry expert said on Thursday . 
the director of interactive media at the German Direct Marketing Association ( DDV ) , Monika Beumers told Reuters that marketing in cyberspace has become a window of opportunity particularly for mid-sized companies . 
&quot; The fast in this area are going to eat the slow alive , &quot; Beumers said , adding that it was a mistake for such companies to hesitate on investing in online marketing for the sake of short-term profits . 
Beumers said the future of online marketing would entail more exchanges of personal data from individual users in return for information about new products or services from companies . 
&quot; This makes so-called push technology possible , which means that not only can users call up offers , but they can also sign up to get specially-prepared data packages , &quot; Beumers said . 
push technology is a feature which allows computer users to subscribe to receive regular shipments of specific information by electronic mail or over a screen saver . 
Beumers said the information exchange between consumers and companies could allow media firms and agencies , as well as online services , to step in as service providers . 
she said there were between 30 and 50 agencies in Germany which are established in the online-marketing field .
