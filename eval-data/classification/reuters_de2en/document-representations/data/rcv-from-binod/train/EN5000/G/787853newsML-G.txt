Katyusha rockets fired from Lebanon slammed into a town in northern Israel on Friday , escalating violence that has killed 13 people this week . 
the Israeli army said a woman was slightly wounded in the attack , which damaged a synagogue where worshippers had gathered for morning prayers in the Upper Galilee town of Kiryat Shmona . 
it was the first time Katyushas had hit the town in the more than 15 months since Israel and pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas undertook not to fire on civilian targets . 
later on Friday Israeli responded sending warplanes to rocket Palestinian guerrilla targets in hills outh of Beirut , Palestinian officials said . 
the Israel Army had no comment on the report . 
two jets fired two rockets into the Na &apos;ameh hills where the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command ( PFLP-GC ) has bases -- 15 km ( nine miles ) south of Beirut . 
the flare-up coincides with a deep crisis on another front , between Israel and the PLO , after a twin Islamic militant suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market on July 30 . 
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross is due in the region on Saturday to mediate between Israel and the Palestinians . 
Jewish settlers in the West Bank town of Hebron said on Friday that they had received a permit to begin groundwork for six new homes in one of their existing enclaves . 
four hundred Jews live amidst 100,000 Palestinians in Hebron . 
while the government has yet to issue permits to build the homes , approval of the groundwork was sure to further anger Palestinians who say settlement building pre-empts peace talks . 
Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai told reporters in English on a tour of northern Israel : 
&quot; Hizbollah damaged today the agreement ... We will do everything that we think that is necessary against the Hizbollah and other terrorism groups in Lebanon . 
the understanding was part of a 1996 ceasefire that ended a 17-day Israeli onslaught mounted to protect northern towns in which about 200 people , mainly Lebanese civilians , were killed . 
Hizbollah , fighting to drive Israeli troops from a south Lebanon occupation zone , denied it launched Friday &apos;s attack . 
but the group &apos;s chief , Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah , said in Beirut that Hizbollah would resume Katyusha attacks on Israel because the 1996 accord had not protected Lebanese civilians . 
&quot; We say the resumption of using other means to protect civilians has become necessary , &quot; Nasrallah said . 
Hizbollah threatened earlier this week to carry out attacks inside Israel . 
&quot; The trouble here , the difficulty , is that the Hizbollah is continuing to act as a proxy army for the Syrians , &quot; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s aide David Bar-Illan , told Reuters . 
Syria has 35,000 troops in Lebanon . 
since Monday , 13 people have died in the violence , including seven Lebanese civilians and a pro-Israeli militiaman , starting with an Israeli commando raid in which five Hizbollah guerrillas were killed with a roadside bomb . 
Israel set up the 15-km ( nine-mile ) border zone in Lebanon with the declared aim of protecting its northern border . 
after the Jerusalem bombing in which 15 people including the attackers died , Israel halted peace talks with the PLO and sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip , stopping trade and preventing Palestinians from getting to jobs in Israel . 
it has also frozen financial transfers . 
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has slammed the blockade as a declaration of war and told Palestinians to &quot; prepare for what will come &quot; . 
he told reporters on Friday he expected Ross &apos;s trip would bring &quot; a stop to this collective punishment which the Israeli government is forcing on the Palestinian people &quot; . 
the European Union , which has a key mediating role in the Middle East peace process , said on Friday it was concerned about what it termed Israel &apos;s counter-productive measures . 
&quot; The EU has decided to ask its representatives in Tel Aviv to make a demarche to Foreign Minister ( David ) Levy to make our concern known , &quot; Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos , whose country currently holds the 15-nation bloc &apos;s rotating presidency , said in a letter to Arafat . 
Netanyahu has accused Arafat of facilitating the work of the bombers and said he must crack down on militants before peace negotiations can resume and Israeli sanctions are lifted . 
the war of words drew a rebuke on Thursday from U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who urged both sides to revive a spirit of partnership on peace . 
Yedioth Ahronoth daily on Friday quoted Netanyahu telling a closed meeting Arafat was acting &quot; like Saddam Hussein in Iraq &quot; . 
&quot; He sacrifices the Palestinian people on the altar of his stubbornness . 
he is playing with the suffering of the Palestinians , &quot; Netanyahu was quoted as saying . 
an opinion poll published on Friday in Yedioth Ahronoth showed 71 percent of Israelis backed Netanyahu &apos;s blockade . 
but the poll , by the Dahaf Institute , showed that 66 percent favoured renewing peacemaking and only 32 percent were in favour of halting it . 
two percent had no response .
