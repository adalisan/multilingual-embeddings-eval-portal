Danish share prices rose in defiance of expectations on Tuesday , propelled mainly by keen interest in shipping heavyweight A.P. 
Moeller , with help from biotech group Novo Nordisk and telecoms group Tele Danmark . 
&quot; We had a positive day , primarily due to new buying in the A.P. 
Moeller companies , &quot; a dealer said , adding that he expected to see the KFX top-20 index gain another 0.5 to 1.0 point on Wednesday . 
the index closed 1.28 point up , at 154.74 , in modest overall bourse turnover of 698 million crowns . 
its June future rose 0.65 point to 153.20 with 120 contracts , each of 100,000-crowns , traded . 
Novo Nordisk rose 10 crowns to 669 crowns and Tele Danmark put on nine crowns to end at 335 , clawing back much of its 11-crown loss from Monday &apos;s profit warning . 
the 51 percent state-owned Tele Danmark on Tuesday issued a new statement saying that losses resulting from new regulatory proposals would be less than previously thought . 
the news came after the market closed but had been widely anticipated .
