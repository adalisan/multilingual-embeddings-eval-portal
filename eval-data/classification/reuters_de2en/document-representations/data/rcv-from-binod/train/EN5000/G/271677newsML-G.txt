Japanese foreign minister Yukihiko Ikeda on Friday met distraught relatives of the Lima hostages and told them negotiators were taking pains not to provoke or be deceived by the guerrillas . 
&quot; He told us that the Peruvian government is dealing cautiously and straightforwardly with the guerrillas so as not to be deceived by smooth talk , &quot; said Michiko Konishi , 52 , whose husband Toshiro , a 53-year-old Japanese restaurant owner , is among the roughly 400 captives . 
&quot; He said the worst thing to do was to provoke them , and that Peru was in complete agreement with this , &quot; said the soft-spoken Konishi , frail from three sleepless nights since the guerrillas stormed the residence of the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence . 
Konishi was one of about 60 relatives , many of them women , of Japanese-Peruvian hostages gathered at the Peruvian-Japanese Society for a meeting with Ikeda . 
security was tight around the building , with each guest escorted in and out by armed police . 
they were frisked and their bags opened for checks before entering . 
many of the women coming out of the gathering , held in closed quarters , shielded their faces from the TV cameras that mobbed them as they emerged and refused to comment . 
men who came out just shook their heads as they left . 
most looked weary and nervous . 
Ikeda made a speech to all those gathered and then met quietly with smaller groups to take questions . 
asked whether any of the relatives expressed frustration at the handling of the situation , either by the Japanese or the Peruvian government , Konishi said she had not heard any . 
unlike the vocal demands for information and criticism in other recent international tragedies like the TWA crash in New York , there was a mood of almost stoic fatalism among the group . 
even when speaking to Peruvian reporters in Spanish , those relatives of Japanese descent showed the reserve and lack of emotion typical of Japanese society . 
the building that houses the Peruvian-Japanese Society , surrounded by a four-tier electrified fence , has become the crisis centre for the community since the hostages were taken . 
the incident , unprecedented in the 100-year history of Peru &apos;s Japanese community , erupted only about a half mile ( 1 km ) from the crisis centre . 
the first group of 790 Japanese immigrants arrived in Peru in 1899 and became farmers . 
the Peruvian-Japanese society houses a 1,000-seat theatre and a medical clinic , as well as a Japanese-style garden . 
on Wednesday , one day after the attack , about 30 executive members of the society who had escaped captivity met in its auditorium to discuss how to deal with the situation . 
about 300 members divided into several groups to deal with blood transfusion , food , nursing and other assistance . 
executive members voted to work in the society office around the clock in order to have a doctor on call 24 hours a day . 
Ikeda tried to assure the relatives that their loved ones were not suffering major hardships . 
&quot; He told us that he understood that the situation inside was calm and that everyone had room to stretch their legs , and that food and water was being provided , &quot; Kohishi said . 
&quot; He gave us his word that top priority was the safety of their lives .
