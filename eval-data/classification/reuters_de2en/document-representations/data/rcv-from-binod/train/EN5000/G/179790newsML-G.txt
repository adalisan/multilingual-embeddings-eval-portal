Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi on Monday lambasted the United Nations for calling on African states to meet the cost of participation in any peace force for eastern Zaire . 
with refugees now feared to be dying in their thousands , Meles said the U.N. demand risked causing further delays . 
&quot; The U.N. Security Council decision that the cost of the operation of ( the neutral force to Zaire ) should be borne by the participating countries ... would naturally make it difficult for African countries to take part in this effort , &quot; Meles said . 
he was addressing the opening session of the Conflict Prevention Committee of the Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) , itself criticised for failing to come up with any meaningful response to the humanitarian crisis in Central Africa . 
last week , a summit of regional leaders in Nairobi called for a &quot; neutral force &quot; to be set up and funded by the Security Council , effectively handing back the issue to the international community after earlier calls for a regional initiative . 
&quot; It is indeed a pity that when African countries have shown a clear disposition to fulfil their responsibilities and take the lead on matters affecting them directly , they are being denied an effective means to do this by the international community , &quot; Meles added . 
some 1.2 million Hutu refugees have fled their camps because of fighting between Tutsi rebels and the Zairean army . 
the United States denied on Monday it was blocking creation of an international force to aid the refugees , saying it had still seen no coherent plan for assembling one . 
several ideas are on the table , but only France has launched a diplomatic campaign to try to secure international backing and Paris &apos;s motives are deeply distrusted by Rwanda , which supports the Tutsi rebellion . 
Meles said he also opposed a 20-day period proposed by U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to send troops to the region . 
&quot; Given the magnitude of the humanitarian and political problems faced by the international community in eastern Zaire , it should be possible with for the U.N. to send a multinational neutral force in a far shorter period , &quot; he said . 
Meles reiterated Ethiopia &apos;s commitment to send troops to the proposed force &quot; provided that principles outlined in the statement by the Nairobi summit are adhered to and provided that all the ground rules for the deployment of the neutral force are worked out by the Security Council . 
among the OAU &apos;s 54 states only Ethiopia and Mali have so far pledged to send troops . 
underlining the reluctance of countries to become involved , only nine foreign ministers of the 17 member states of the OAU &apos;s conflict committee attended the one-day session in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa . 
East African peace mediator Julius Nyerere asked South African President Nelson Mandela on Saturday to contribute to a Zaire peace force but Mandela said he needed more information . 
but Mandela said he needed specific details and said he was still &quot; in the dark &quot; about the situation on the ground .
