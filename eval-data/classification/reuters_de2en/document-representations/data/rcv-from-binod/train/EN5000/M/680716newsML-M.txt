the Indian rupee ended steady at 35.81 / 82 against the dollar on Monday , dealers said . 
the spot rupee moved in a narrow groove as hopes of an intervention by the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) prevented the rupee weakening despite poor dollar demand , dealers said . 
the RBI bought outright July and August dollars on Monday , pushing the forward premiums up by a few paise , dealer said . 
RBI has been buying in the spot market in recent months . 
&quot; December dollars fell to the 72 / 74 paise from the 76 / 77 paise level , &quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank . 
RBI bought only July and August dollars but this helped push up December premiums to 76 / 77 levels , dealers said . 
they said the RBI was &quot; killing several birds with one stone , &quot; through its Monday intervention . 
it was also supporting the dollar and holding the rupee at the current level without releasing rupees into the system immediately , dealers said . 
the six month annualised forward premium crashed through the 4.0 percent mark , closing at 3.97 percent on Monday . 
the forward premiums have been crashing as exporters continued to sell their receivables and importers continued to avoid hedging their risks , dealers said .
