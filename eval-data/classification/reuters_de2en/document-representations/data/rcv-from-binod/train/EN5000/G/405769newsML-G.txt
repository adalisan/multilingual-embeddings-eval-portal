convicted murderer Coleman Wayne Gray on Wednesday awaited execution by the state of Virginia at 9 p.m. est but was still hoping for a last-minute reprieve . 
Gray , 39 , was convicted of the May 1985 murder of grocery store manager Richard McClelland and his case has wound its way through the legal system for more than 11 years . 
now Gray &apos;s life hangs by two slender threads -- his lawyer has filed petitions to the U.S. Supreme Court and has asked Virginia Gov. 
George Allen for clemency . 
meanwhile , preparations for his execution by lethal injection in Virginia &apos;s Greensville correctional Centre were going ahead . 
Gray &apos;s mother has come to be with him but will have to leave him at 3 p.m. 
one of his lawyers , Donald Lee , drove down to the prison Tuesday night to say goodbye , and another will be with him Wednesday . 
if no stay is granted , Gray will eat his last meal at 6 p.m. and take his last shower an hour later . 
an all-white jury convicted Gray , who is black , of robbing and abducting McClelland , a white , and shooting him six times in the back of the head despite his pleas for mercy . 
he was found guilty largely on the testimony of his accomplice , Melvin Tucker , but Gray insists that Tucker was the trigger man . 
Tucker also testified in the penalty phase of Gray &apos;s trial that he bragged of having committed two other murders -- the 1984 killings of Lisa Sorrell and her 3-year-old daughter Shanta -- in much the same way he allegedly killed McClelland . 
the prosecutor had promised the defence it would not bring in additional evidence about the Sorrell murders , but he went back on his word and introduced gruesome forensic evidence about the case , which the defence was unprepared to rebut . 
the defence lawyers did not know , so the jury never heard , that there was another strong suspect in the Sorrell case . 
in fact , Gray was never charged with the Sorrell murders . 
in an affidavit filed last week to the Court of Appeals in Richmond , Tucker recanted his testimony about the Sorrell killings , saying he was forced to perjure himself by the prosecution to avoid the death penalty . 
but he still maintains Gray killed McClelland . 
&quot; My testimony concerning Coleman Gray telling me that he killed the Sorrell woman and child was a lie , &quot; Tucker said in his affidavit . 
but the Richmond court rejected the petition . 
last year Virginia led the nation in executions with eight . 
critics say the system penalises the poor , especially blacks accused of killing whites . 
the American Bar Association recently called for executions to be suspended , calling the system &quot; a haphazard maze of unfair practices with no internal consistency &quot; and condemning what it said were &quot; longstanding patterns of racial discrimination in courts across the country . 
there is also criticism of the use of lethal injection , which has become the method of execution used by most states . 
Alex Kozinski , an appeals court judge in California who has been involved in several capital cases , said lethal injection had become the method of choice because it was reliable , painless and nonviolent . 
&quot; But I find it creepy that we pervert the instruments of healing -- the needle , the pump , the catheter , FDA-approved drugs -- by putting them to such antithetical use . 
it also bothers me that we mask the most violent act society can inflict on one of its members with such an antiseptic veneer , &quot; he wrote recently in the New Yorker . 
the first time Gray &apos;s case reached the Supreme Court in 1995 , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that he had been denied his fundamental right to due process and said the prosecutor &apos;s behaviour had &quot; fatally infected &quot; his case for the death penalty . 
but the court , by a scant five to four majority , ruled against Gray .
