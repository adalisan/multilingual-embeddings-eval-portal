Australian captain Mark Taylor took a blinding catch in the slips and made a polished 45 as his side took a firm grip on the fifth test -- and the ashes -- against England at Trent Bridge on Saturday . 
Taylor put on 51 for the first wicket with Matthew Elliott as Australia began their second innings looking to capitalise on a first innings lead of 114 . 
Elliott fell to a magnificent diving catch by John Crawley on the square-leg boundary as he tried to hook Andy Caddick . 
but Taylor and Greg Blewett ensured that England , who must win the test to have a chance of winning the series , ended the third day thinking more realistically only of survival . 
both were dismissed , along with Mark Waugh , before the close but Australia , who lead the six-test series 2-1 , finished on 167 for four , an overall lead of 281 . 
Taylor , like Elliott , miscued a hook off Ben Hollioake and skied a simple chance to Nasser Hussain at mid-wicket and Mark Waugh was lbw to Dean Headley . 
Blewett , ignoring the scoreboard which was posting his name as &quot; Blewitt &quot; , consolidated Australia &apos;s dominance , however , with a fine 60 . 
unfortunately it ended when he was adjudged to have gloved another attempted pull off Caddick to wicketkeeper Alec Stewart . 
Replays suggested , however , that he may not have touched the ball . 
the day started well for England , who resumed on 188 for four in reply to Australia &apos;s first innings of 427 . 
the Surrey pair of Graham Thorpe , dropped in the slips by Steve Waugh on 31 , and Adam Hollioake extended their fifth wicket stand to 102 before both departed in the space of five deliveries . 
Adam Hollioake was the first to go for 45 when he edged a delivery from Paul Reiffel and Taylor took a fine catch diving low to his right at first slip . 
in the next over , Thorpe , on 53 , gave leg-spinner Shane Warne his fourth wicket when Blewett snapped him up at short-leg . 
Ben Hollioake , denied the chance of batting with his brother , made an assured 28 but Reiffel and Glenn McGrath worked their way through the lower order to dismiss England for 313 . 
McGrath took four for 71 and Warne four for 86 . 
McGrath said : &quot; We &apos;re in a pretty good position . 
if we get a lead of 400 tomorrow , that &apos;s pretty daunting . 
&quot; The wicket will start to turn a bit more , which should help Shane . 
England coach David Lloyd said : &quot; We bowled with great fire , determination , commitment and endeavour . 
both Hollioakes looked assured , strong and comfortable . 
but we &apos;re firmly second favourites . 
earlier in the day , Michael Atherton denied a report in a British newspaper that he had offered to resign as England captain on the eve of the match . 
Atherton said he intended to continue as captain at least until the end of the series .
