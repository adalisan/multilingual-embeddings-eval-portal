Hutchison Whampoa Ltd on Wednesday held the first of a series of roadshows in a bid to raise US $ 1 billion in the Yankee market . 
it is a multi-tranche deal , with market sources suggesting maturities could include five , 10 , 20 , 30 and 40 years . 
Hutchison has not commented on pricing , although unconfirmed reports indicate 80 basis points over U.S. treasuries for the 10-year tranche . 
&quot; Basically , we feel very comfortable with this credit , &quot; one member of the winning group said , citing its 35 percent stake in The Hong Kong Electric Co Ltd 0-006.HK , and its ownership of two cement plants . 
&quot; These are very stable businesses , &quot; he commented . 
Syndication should start on Friday , with an all-in of about 50 basis points , or slightly less , bankers said . 
this is well down on the 97 basis point all-in paid by New World Infrastructure Ltd in its recent five-year term loan / revolver , reflecting their respective ratings . 
the issue through the Singapore branch carries a coupon of 30 basis points over six-month London Interbank offered Rate . 
food processor and distributor ng Fung Hong Ltd is expected to seek US $ 150 million either through a floating-rate note or a loan . 
ng Fung Hong is 25.91 percent owned by red chip China Resources Enterprise Ltd . 
Everbright Bank of China will launch a US $ 64 million syndicated loan on Thursday , bankers said . 
the five-year facility pays a margin of 46 basis points over the one- , three- or six-month London Interbank offered Rate . 
the loan has been fully underwritten by the arrangers -- Bayerische Landesbank , Chase Manhattan Asia , Deutsche Bank and ING Barings . 
major shareholders of the bank are China Everbright-IHD Pacific Ltd and China Everbright Group , which is controlled by China &apos;s State Council .
