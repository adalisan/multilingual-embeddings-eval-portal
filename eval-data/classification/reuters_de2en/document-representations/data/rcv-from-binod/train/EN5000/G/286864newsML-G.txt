former Russia coach Pavel Sadyrin has taken over at CSKA Moscow after being sacked by Zenit St Petersburg in November , the Moscow premier league club confirmed on Saturday . 
Sadyrin , who crowned a previous spell at CSKA by winning the last championship of the Soviet Union in 1991 , had announced the move on New Year &apos;s Day . 
but Alexander Tarkhanov , who guided CSKA to fifth place in the 1996 Russian championship , said he knew nothing of the deal and was not planning to resign . 
the CSKA management said bluntly that Tarkhanov had no contract with them and that Sadyrin had been appointed . 
Sadyrin will not face his first major challenge on the pitch until spring , when the 1997 season begins , but players were due back in training on Saturday after their winter break . 
Sadyrin parted company with Zenit after they finished 10th in the league , a year after he led them back to the top flight . 
he was a player with the club when it was known as Zenit Leningrad and later coached them to the 1984 Soviet league title . 
he was sacked as Russia &apos;s coach after a stormy two years which ended with a humbling exit from the 1994 World Cup finals . 
several key players boycotted the squad amid accusations of arrogance and inexperience .
