a fire burned through the downtown area of this flooded city early on Sunday morning , complicating evacuation efforts and forcing officials to divert scarce resources to fight the blaze . 
&quot; This fire is still burning out of control , &quot; an unnamed firefighter told a television newscast shortly before midnight local time on Saturday ( 1 a.m. EDT on Sunday ) . 
firefighting efforts were hindered as several feet of muddy floodwater sat still in the streets of downtown Grand forks , preventing firetrucks from approaching the blaze . 
the swollen Red River began to spill over clay dikes Friday , forcing thousands of people to evacuate and inundating hundreds of homes and businesses . 
thick black plumes of smoke billowed into the sky after the fire broke out on Saturday afternoon in a multi-story commercial building . 
television footage showed that the fire had spread to at least three buildings , although Grand forks Fire Department officials could not confirm how many structures were burning . 
there were no reports of serious injuries or of a possible cause . 
&quot; They &apos;re trying to control the fire , &quot; said Don Shields of Grand forks Emergency Management . 
&quot; It &apos;s awfully difficult ... to pinpoint a cause when you &apos;ve got that kind of water that we do in the downtown area . 
it was a scene of bitter irony as firefighters searched frantically through murky brown water for hydrants to which they could attach hoses . 
these efforts were unsuccessful , and authorities then tried an aerial assault on the blaze . 
a low-flying airplane dumped a chemical retardant on the fire , but the effort was futile and the flames raged on . 
authorities stopped the airborne effort as darkness fell over the city . 
rescue workers had to evacuate 20 people from one burning building -- people who were supposed to have already left the area but had stubbornly remained behind . 
officials said an unspecified number of residents in the mandatory evacuation area stayed in their homes too long , making evacuation efforts more difficult and more dangerous . 
grand forks Mayor Pat Owens imposed a curfew over the evacuation area , and said police and National Guard troops would arrest any unauthorised people in those zones . 
&quot; We urgently ask residents to leave voluntarily before they are in an emergency situation , &quot; Owens said . 
&quot; We have not lost any lives in this flood so far , and we desperately want to keep it that way . 
the flood shut all three bridges connecting Grand forks to its sister city East Grand forks , Minn . 
the bridge closures meant that the Red River was impassable for vehicles between Fargo , N.D. , and the Canadian border -- a distance of about 150 miles . 
thousands of flood victims filled three cavernous airplane hangars Saturday evening at the U.S. Air Force Base 15 miles west of downtown Grand forks . 
hundreds of cots were laid out side by side in the hangars , and weary evacuees pulled covers over their heads to gain some sense of privacy . 
at least one group was taking a small degree of pleasure from the disaster . 
university of North Dakota President Kendall Baker cancelled the rest of the school &apos;s academic year Saturday , sending approximately 11,000 students into an early summer vacation .
