- Michigan Gov. 
John Engler announced Monday that 11 sites have been selected for the state &apos;s new tax-free &quot; Renaissance Zones . 
if approved by the state &apos;s Administrative Board on Wednesday , the sites will become virtually free of state income , property and business taxes , as well as local income , property and utility taxes as of Jan . 1 . 
State sales taxes would still be collected in the Renaissance Zones and property taxes needed to pay debt service on unlimited tax general obligation bonds issued by local governments and school districts will also be collected , state officials have said . 
however , tax increment financing debt sold by downtown development authorities or special district are not accommodated under the law , passed by the state legislature in July . 
as for operating funds lost by communities , the state will replace those funds for school districts , community colleges and libraries . 
&quot; Today , Michigan begins the nation &apos;s boldest experiment in the renewal of distressed communities , &quot; Engler said in a news release . 
he added that the zones , the first of their kind in the nation , would help distressed parts of Michigan attract jobs . 
recommended sites for the zones were 120 acres in the Benton Harbor , St. Joseph , Benton township area ; 1,345 acres in Detroit ; 836 acres in Flint , 536 acres in Grand Rapids ; 110 acres in Lansing ; 743 acres in Saginaw ; 2,917 arcres in the Gogebic , Ontonagon , Houghton counties area ; 556 acres in Manistee County ; and 1,870 acres in Montcalm and Gratiot counties . 
two former military sites in Warren and Oscodo were also recommended for the zones .
