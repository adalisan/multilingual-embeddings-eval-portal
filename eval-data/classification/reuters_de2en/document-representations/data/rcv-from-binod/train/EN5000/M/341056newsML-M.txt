the recent runup in frozen concentrated orange juice futures is not expected to translate into higher prices at the checkout counter , analysts said , since retail prices have remained artificially high for the past year . 
&quot; Prices were high to begin with , &quot; Dean Witter vice president Celeste Georgakis , said . 
&quot; Until we quantify the ( freeze ) damage , the industry doesn &apos;t want to move ahead . 
the freeze that swept through the Florida citrus belt earlier this month sparked fears that juice yields will fall , and fueled FCOJ futures to a high of 99.00 cents a lb Tuesday , from a recent low of 76.40 cents . 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture is not expected to release a tally of the damage until mid-February , but the Florida Department of Agriculture estimates losses at $ 60 million . 
mark Gutsche , a spokesman for Tropicana , said the company has not decided whether to raise orange juice prices . 
&quot; everyday people are realizing it was a more significant freeze , &quot; Gutsche said . 
&quot; But we don &apos;t know whether it will have an impact on consumer prices . 
Merrill Lynch anlayst Judith Ganes said retail prices should remain unchanged and could eventually decline if demand falls even further , regardless of the recent rally in futures prices . 
huge crops expected in the U.S. and Brazil for both the current season and next year should put additional pressure on prices , she said . 
the USDA put Florida &apos;s crop at 220 million 90-lb boxes before the freeze . 
last year , retail prices for orange juice surged to reflect a sharp rise in cash prices . 
while cash prices have remained lower since the fall , futures prices have declined significantly , and consumers have seemingly lost their taste for orange juice , the price of a carton of orange juice has remained high . 
&quot; Retailers are into making a profit , and when their prices go up they are quick to raise prices , &quot; Philip Lesser , an economist with the Florida Department of citrus , said . 
&quot; However , they are not as quick to adjust the numbers in their computers when prices come down . 
the department launched a $ 40 million advertising campaign in September to promote orange juice as a heart-healthy drink to boost consumption amid record output . 
while it is too soon to gauge the campaign &apos;s effect , the public supports its message , according to consumer tracking polls . 
&quot; We expect that to translate into increased sales , &quot; Lesser said .
