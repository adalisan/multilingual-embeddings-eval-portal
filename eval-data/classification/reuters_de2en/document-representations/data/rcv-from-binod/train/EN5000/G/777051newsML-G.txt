Portugal said on Monday it regretted a decision by South Africa to expel its ambassador over the leaking of a misdirected note from President Nelson Mandela to Indonesian President Suharto . 
&quot; The South African authorities , alleging a misunderstanding between the Portuguese embassy and the South African presidency , last Friday ( August 1 ) requested the departure from Pretoria of Ambassador Vasco Valente , &quot; a Foreign Ministry statement said . 
&quot; The ambassador , who had been due to leave Pretoria at the end of August , returned to Lisbon the next day , &quot; it added , saying Portugal regretted the decision . 
South African government sources had earlier confirmed that the ambassador had been given 48 hours to leave . 
it was the first time South Africa had expelled a diplomat since Mandela became the its first democratically elected leader in 1994 . 
the sources said Mandela had written to Suharto in mid-July , asking him to release East Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao as a first step towards resolving the conflict there . 
the letter was sent in error to the embassy of Portugal , East Timor &apos;s former colonial power , and was neither returned nor forwarded to the Indonesian embassy . 
Mandela &apos;s proposal was leaked to newspapers in Portugal before Suharto was made aware of it and the incident bruised his attempt to bolster a United Nations effort to resolve the conflict over Indonesia &apos;s disputed rule in East Timor . 
the South African sources said the incident had not permanently damaged relations with Indonesia or Portugal . 
Mandela , whose own release after 27 years in jail opened the way in 1990 to a peaceful settlement in South Africa four years later , met Gusmao during a recent visit to Indonesia . 
he has since invited Suharto to visit South Africa in November , following a proposed visit by East Timorese bishop and Nobel peace laureate Ximenes Belo in October . 
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan will see Mandela on Friday to discuss their joint initiative for peace in East Timor . 
Indonesia entered the territory in 1975 after Portugal relinquished colonial rule in 1974 , and a small group of armed guerrillas are still fighting Indonesian rule , which is not recognised by the United Nations .
