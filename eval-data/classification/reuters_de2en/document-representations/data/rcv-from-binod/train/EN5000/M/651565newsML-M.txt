Naphtha prices slipped in quiet afternoon trade in Tokyo , while traders focused on continuing term contract talks with Kuwait and Abu Dhabi , traders said on Tuesday . 
Abu Dhabi National Oil Co ( ADNOC ) notified three Japanese trading houses , one Japanese refiner and one South Korean petrochemical firm of its revised offer price of $ 21.75 per tonne over the ADNOC formula for one-year supply contracts starting in July . 
the new offer level compared with ADNOC &apos;s original offer of $ 22.50 over the formula . 
in the current term year , the premium was set at $ 6.80 . 
ADNOC told clients that the latest offer was final and that they could either take it or leave it , traders said . 
however , one trader said his firm would not accept ADNOC &apos;s new offer as he believes ADNOC is still willing to negotiate .
