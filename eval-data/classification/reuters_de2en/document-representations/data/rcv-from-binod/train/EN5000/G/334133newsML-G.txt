England &apos;s tailenders frustrated the New Zealand attack on Monday to establish a 131-run first innings lead at tea on the fourth day of the first cricket test at Eden Park in Auckland . 
replying to New Zealand &apos;s first innings 390 , England were all out for 521 , with the tea interval delayed 15 minutes . 
Lefthander Graham Thorpe added only two runs to his lunchtime score of 117 before treading on his wicket when facing allrounder Chris Cairns . 
he batted 340 minutes , faced 245 balls and hit 17 fours for his magnificent third test ton . 
he added 114 in 177 minutes with Dominic Cork for the seventh wicket . 
while the run rate slowed appreciably with Thorpe &apos;s dismissal , the tailenders put paid to New Zealand &apos;s hopes of a quick end to England &apos;s first innings . 
Cork and Darren Gough took 46 balls to score 18 runs until Gough was caught behind by Lee Germon off a scorching Danny Morrison delivery . 
Cork and Alan Mullally used up 35 balls adding seven at a time when England might have looked for fast runs to put some pressure on New Zealand &apos;s second innings . 
Cork made 59 , his second test half century , before being brilliantly caught by Bryan Young , running back at midwicket and diving full length to clutch the ball . 
but the final insult for the New Zealand bowlers came from last pair Mullally and Phil Tufnell , who added 43 in 79 balls . 
that partnership delayed the tea adjournment until Mullally was caught behind off Morrison for 21 . 
Tufnell finished unbeaten on 19 . 
the last three wickets of the innings fell to fast-medium Morrison , who was flattered by ending with the best figures of the New Zealand attack , three for 104 .
