the number of cattle placed in major U.S. feedlots during July will be key on Friday &apos;s government cattle on Feed Report as analysts already know that the total number of cattle on feed were above year-ago levels . 
the placements number will indicate the supply of market-ready cattle available to packers in coming months . 
a Reuter survey of analysts produced an average estimate for July cattle placements in feedlots with 1,000 or more head in the seven key states at 100.8 percent of a year ago in a range of 96.0 to 106.5 percent . 
some analysts expect a shift from larger-than-year-ago placements to smaller placements due to recent tighter feeder cattle supplies . 
but others cited high prices in deferred live cattle futures which may have encouraged continued hefty placements . 
they referred particularly , to a period in late July , when Chicago Mercantile Exchange December live cattle futures traded in the 73-cent-per-lb area , setting new contract highs in the process . 
by comparison , that contract early Wednesday was trading at 71.900 cents . 
&quot; We are making the shift from placements running above a year ago levels to under year ago levels , &quot; said Dan Vaught , analyst with A.G. Edwards , who estimated placements at 98 percent . 
&quot; I think we are going to run ( placements ) under last year probably through October at least , &quot; Vaught said . 
chuck Levitt , senior analyst with Alaron Trading Corp estimated placements at 96 percent of a year ago , adding that he was anticipating that some cattle movement during July was from one pasture to another and from pastures into holding pens and not directly into feedlots . 
he also said placements during July could actually be closer to 100 percent and any number slightly under 100 would be considered neutral . 
but Levitt added that a number over 100 percent would be very bearish , especially in light of a five-percent reduction in feeder cattle supplies . 
&quot; If the placements come in above a year ago , considering we had the tighter supply of feeder cattle to draw from , that would be flatly bearish , &quot; Levitt said . 
Tom Tippens , CEO of Professional cattle Consultants , estimated placements at 106.5 percent , citing high-priced futures which likely encouraged more placements . 
&quot; People are still very optimistic - we have big premiums in the back end of futures which continued to encourage placements , &quot; Tippens said . 
however , feedlot marketings were considered active during July and all analysts surveyed expected that marketings were above July 1996 marketings . 
July marketings estimates averaged 105.5 percent of a year ago in a range of 103 to 107 percent . 
the marketings increase compared with a year ago reflects a larger-than-year-earlier fed cattle supplies in the slaughter mix . 
cow and bull slaughter was down 13 percent this year from last during July , while total cattle slaughter was up about 1.5 percent , analysts said . 
but even with active marketings this still leaves a lot of cattle on feed versus a year ago , they said . 
estimates for the total number of cattle on feed in the seven major feedlot states averaged 115.6 percent of a year earlier , in a range of 114 to 117.8 percent . 
&quot; A 15-percent increase in the numbers on feed still indicates that we have a large front end supply of cattle to eat our way through the remainder of summer and most of the fall period , &quot; Levitt added . 
analysts continued to estimate seven-state numbers while building historical data on the relatively new 12-state part of the report . 
USDA made revisions to its seven-state report and introduced a 12-state report in January 1996 .
