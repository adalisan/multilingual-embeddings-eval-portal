a white former paratrooper who prosecutors called &quot; pure , unmitigated evil &quot; was sentenced to life in prison on Thursday for gunning down two black people in a racially motivated killing . 
in a rambling address to the court before he was sentenced , ex-Army soldier James Burmeister apologised to the families of the victims but called the case against him &quot; smoke and mirrors &quot; and said his fight for justice was not over . 
superior Court Judge coy Brewer sentenced Burmeister , 21 , to two consecutive life prison terms after a jury deadlocked 11-1 in favour of executing him . 
Burmeister , who will have to serve at least 50 years on the two murder convictions before becoming eligible for parole , also was sentenced to 16 to 20 years for conspiracy to commit murder . 
&quot; We &apos;re delighted the son of a bitch will be put away for the rest of his life , &quot; prosecutor Edward Grannis said . 
Burmeister was found guilty last Thursday in the racially motivated slayings of Michael James , 36 , and Jackie Burden , 27 , on Dec . 7 , 1995 . 
the jury found he shot the couple at close range as they walked along a street in Fayetteville , which adjoins Fort Bragg , home to the U.S. Army &apos;s elite 82nd airborne Division . 
in a halting speech to the court , his voice occasionally cracking , Burmeister apologised to the victim &apos;s families for the pain they suffered but criticised the state &apos;s case against him . 
&quot; If the state has chosen to blame me for this , so be it for now , &quot; Burmeister said . 
it &apos;s not over by any means . 
the seven-man , five-woman jury deliberated for about seven hours over two days before saying it was hung . 
once the jury was declared deadlocked , Brewer could not impose a death sentence by state law . 
jurors who spoke to reporters after the hearing said they had deadlocked 11-1 in favour of the death penalty . 
the holdout was a woman . 
&quot; I &apos;m sure when she told the court that she could impose the death penalty if it was warranted , that when faced with the reality , she could not do it , &quot; juror Darcy Day , 28 , said . 
jurors said they hoped the result of the trial would send a message to hate groups that such violence would not be tolerated .
