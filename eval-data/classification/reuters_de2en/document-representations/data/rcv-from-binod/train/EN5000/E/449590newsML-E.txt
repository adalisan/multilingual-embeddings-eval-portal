South Africa could not afford expansionary budgets if it was to deliver on its macroeonomic plan designed to double growth by 2000 , finance department director general Maria Ramos said on Tuesday . 
briefing the parliamentary finance committee after last week &apos;s 1997 / 98 budget , Ramos warned that populist budgets aimed at improving social services regardless of cost would be counter-productive . 
Ramos and state expenditure director general Hannes Smit told the committee the management and control of state finances would be improved by the development of three-year budgets . 
government is currently working on a medium term expenditure framework ( MTEF ) involving a shift from the present system of year-on-year budgets to three-year rolling budgets . 
this would allow for greater stability and certainty in planning and over time would reduce the need for rollovers and for front-loading for capital expenditure projects . 
&quot; Importantly , it allows for reprioritisation and rationalisation . 
it allows you to make choices , &quot; she said . 
this would require a degree of risk assessment as well and it was therefore clear that a different set of skills would to needed to those currently needed in budgeting . 
on the revenue side , the department of finance was also starting to work on a medium term revenue framework to identify revenue sources and how they tied in with the overall direction of taxation policy , borrowing strategies and spending limts . 
she said this approach was important because if government merely adopted &quot; a popular , expansionary route and simply set out to fulfill the expenditure wish lists &quot; without taking revenue into account , it would not meet its development goals . 
&quot; The expansionary scenario , incidentally , is one that does not allow the economy , because of the resource constraint , to grow by more than three to 3.5 percent , &quot; she said . 
some departments would have to face budget cuts as services were rationalised while growth sometimes would level off even in priority social services , she said .
