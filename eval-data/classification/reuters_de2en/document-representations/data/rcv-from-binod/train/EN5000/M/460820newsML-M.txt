* Central Bank closes overnight borrowing facility 
Philippine interbank call loan rates remained at an average of 10.03125 percent on Friday but touched a low of 10 percent after the Central Bank again closed its overnight borrowing facility , traders said . 
&quot; It ( the Central Bank ) opened for a little while and closed it . 
so banks had no choice but to lend to each other , &quot; a dealer said . 
the Central Bank had done the same thing on Thursday , saying it had already squared its positions . 
market volume fell to 6.865 billion from 10.179 billion pesos , marked by 21 lenders and 18 borrowers . 
&quot; Everybody is cautious right now , waiting for Central Bank &apos;s next move . 
it didn &apos;t change its overnight rate but it closed its overnight borrowing facility , &quot; a big bank dealer said . 
thus , banks didn &apos;t see active positioning in the secondary market , traders said . 
there were buyers of short-term bills just to meet corporate requirements , they said . 
banks , however , were more interested in buying the one-year bills where rates were higher than the Central Bank &apos;s , they said . 
a Reuter poll of six financial institutions gave bid rates of 10.625 to 10.50 on the one-year bills .
