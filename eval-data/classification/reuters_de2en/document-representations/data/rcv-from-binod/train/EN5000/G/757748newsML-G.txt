on the eve of his meeting with an influential group of U.S. senators , NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said on Thursday he believed support for expansion of the alliance was growing in the Senate . 
&quot; I do think and I do feel that a bipartisan movement is growing in the Senate in order to achieve this objective of having NATO open to new members before 1999 , &quot; Solana said . 
&quot; I think that is an objective that will be good for everybody , &quot; Solana said in a discussion before the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia and other foreign affairs organisations . 
on Friday , Solana is to meet in Washington with the 28-member Senate NATO Observer Group to make his case for NATO expansion . 
among those expected at the meeting is Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott , a Republican from Mississippi . 
a two-thirds vote of the 100-member Senate is required to ratify the expansion of NATO to include former Soviet bloc members Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic . 
the three countries were invited earlier this month to join the alliance , which currently has 16 members . 
the new members are expected to enter in April , 1999 . 
the expansion must be ratified by the parliaments of all current members . 
Friday &apos;s meeting will be Solana &apos;s first formal meeting with the Senate group to discuss the expansion , but he said he had been in frequent contact with senators and U.S. congress members . 
NATO spokesman Jamie shea told Reuters that Solana was &quot; confident &quot; that NATO expansion would win approval , but that he regarded close involvement with the Senate members as essential . 
&quot; It will be carefully scrutinised . 
there will be a debate , &quot; shea said of the enlargement plan . 
&quot; We want , at a very early stage , to engage them .
