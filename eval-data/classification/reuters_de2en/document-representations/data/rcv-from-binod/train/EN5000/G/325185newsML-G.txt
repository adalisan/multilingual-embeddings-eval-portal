the European Commission , flying in the face of Franco-German eagerness to see the European Union embrace former Iron Curtain countries at the millennium , said on Wednesday no new country was likely to join before 2002 . 
days after French President Jacques Chirac told Hungary he saw no reason why it and other central European neighbours could not join by 2000 , the EU executive predicted lengthy and complicated talks . 
&quot; Taking into account the possible duration of negotiations and time needed for ratification , the earliest realistic date for the first accessions is likely to be no earlier than 2002 , &quot; it said in a 30-point fact sheet on the EU &apos;s expansion process . 
the Commission -- charged with preparing the groundwork for talks with 10 applicant central and eastern European countries -- was only saying in public what officials have been saying privately for some time . 
but the Czech Republic , Poland and Hungary -- the most economically advanced applicants -- hung on to every word recently as Chirac and French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said a target date of 2000 was achievable if there was &quot; political will &quot; . 
Chirac , trying to overturn the east &apos;s vision of France as against its integration , is championning the enlargement into former communist Europe and the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation . 
he counts on the backing of France &apos;s ally of modern times , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl . 
as the shining economic stars of the former communist bloc Poland , Hungary , and the Czech republic have lobbied hard to get in on their own merits and not wait for struggling countries like Bulgaria and Romania to catch up . 
the three Baltic States -- Latvia , Estonia and Lithuania -- have also applied , along with Slovenia and Slovakia . 
Warsaw , Prague and Budapest are also seen as favourites to be invited for a first wave of separate expansion talks at NATO at an alliance summit set for July 8-9 in Madrid . 
Alliance sources said on Wednesday Slovenia was emerging as the best placed outsider . 
Romania was likely to be left out of NATO &apos;s first expansion , despite heavy lobbying by France , they said . 
the European Commission confirmed that it was unlikely the new EU members would be able to join the bloc at the same time . 
the Commission is currently working on individual advice -- taking into account the political and economic situation in each country . 
the treaty is scheduled to be concluded in June at the EU &apos;s Amsterdam summit . 
the Commission is working out the advice on the basis of 30,000 pages of questionnaires supplied by the applicants . 
on Wednesday it pointed to improvements which were needed in some countries in judicial systems , privatisation and banking and said some countries still had to prove respect for minorities and independence for radio and television stations . 
&quot; Democratic criteria are going to be an important element in the opinions . 
the performance of the applicant countries is on the whole satisfactory but some problems are apprarent , &quot; the Commission said . 
the EU is also due to start talks with Cyprus while Malta &apos;s application to join has been put on hold .
