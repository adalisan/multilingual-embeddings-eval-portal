Vietnam has set up an independent police department to tackle a growing drugs problem highlighted by a recent heroin-trafficking scandal involving security personnel . 
official media said on Wednesday that the &quot; C17 &quot; department would be responsible for combating narcotics and related crimes and advising the country &apos;s police chief on how to involve the public in fighting drugs . 
the move separates the country &apos;s drugs squad from the Economic Police , one of several arms of the Ministry of Interior &apos;s central police department . 
Interior Minister Le Minh Huong was quoted by the Communist Party daily as saying that the degenerate behaviour of some officers had dented the prestige and credibility of the police . 
&quot; In future we must be determined to overcome ... shortcomings and remaining problems , to dismiss and expel degenerate officers from our force , &quot; he told hundreds of officers who gathered to mark the 35th Tradition Day of the Vietnam People &apos;s Police ( VPP ) . 
eight people were sentenced to death and 14 to prison terms -- most for life -- in May for for their part in a massive heroin-trafficking racket . 
half of the defendants were police officers or border guards , which turned the case into a national scandal . 
the courtroom drama also highlighted Vietnam &apos;s emerging role as a transit route for heroin from remote , opium-poppy growing areas of neighbouring Laos and Burma . 
drug experts say the country &apos;s moves over the past decade to open borders long closed to the outside world , combined with rampant corruption , have brought a bonanza for international dealers . 
despite Huong &apos;s criticism , media reports showed that the Tradition Day meeting was more of a congratulatory affair . 
Huong highlighted the force &apos;s &quot; brilliant feats of arms &quot; and Senior Politburo member Nong Duc Manh was no less sparing in his praise . 
&quot; The VPP has displayed sustained zeal in improving their professional skills and efficiency to maintain political stability , national security and law enforcement , with most policemen proving to be loyal to the nation &apos;s path to development and socialism ... &quot; he said .
