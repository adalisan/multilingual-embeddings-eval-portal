Tokyo naphtha prices were little changed in lacklustre trade on Tuesday with most end-user demand for February having been met , traders said . 
output cuts at some Singapore refineries had yet to affect the market . 
&quot; Today &apos;s prices are mostly notional as there are few firm players in the market , &quot; one naphtha trader said . 
First-half April open-spec naphtha was assessed at $ 229.00 / 230.50 in afternoon trade . 
it was sold from a Japanese trading house to a Singapore trader at $ 239.50 on Monday . 
Second-half March was quoted at $ 230.50 / 232.00 , compared with late Monday &apos;s levels of $ 232.00 / 233.00 . 
Naphtha spreads were also stable , with second-half March / second-half April indicated at plus $ 3.00 / 4.00 . 
shell Singapore and Esso Singapore have started production cuts at their refineries on the back of plunging product prices . 
traders considered the crude run cuts as a bullish factor on the regional naphtha market . 
but the move has yet to affect the naphtha market , traders said . 
with February requirements largely satisfied , naphtha buyers at petrochemical firms are taking a breather before starting probing the market for March cargoes , traders said .
