Irish bonds remained strong along the curve in thin afternoon trade on Wednesday , buoyed by ongoing punt strength in the ERM grid , dealers said . 
&quot; We started out well bid at the shorter-end on the back of sterling &apos;s strong performance . 
sterling fell away around mid-day but we are still in good shape and have managed to hold on to yesterday &apos;s gains , &quot; one dealer said . 
&quot; volumes have not been particularly large while yields are lower . 
Irish bonds are four basis points lower in the 10-year area and between five and six basis points lower in the shorter-end . 
we have managed to outperform other markets again today , &quot; the dealer added . 
traders attributed Ireland &apos;s outperformance to the punt &apos;s position at the top of the ERM grid where it was trading around 11.52 percent above the weakest currency . 
&quot; That has led to downward pressure on interbank rates but we have also seen a lot of resistance from the Irish Central Bank , &quot; the dealer said , adding that the bank had been draining liquidity from the money market . 
by 1655 GMT , the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was up 15 pence from Tuesday &apos;s close at 103.65 to yield 5.58 percent while the key benchmark eight percent bond due 2006 was up 27 pence from the close at 111.32 to yield 6.36 percent . 
dealers said Irish bonds were trading at 143 basis points over German bunds in the five-year area and 84 basis points over bunds in the 10-year area . 
one-month money rate was at 5.69 / 5.81 compared to 5.56 / 5.69 at Tuesday &apos;s close while the one-year money rate was at 5.75 / 5.88 compared to 5.63 / 5.75 at the close . 
dealers said attention tomorrow would continue to focus on the currency but the market would also keep an eye on the U.S. where the Treasury plans to sell $ 12.0 billion of 10-year notes on Wednesday followed by $ 10.0 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday . 
it auctioned $ 17.75 billion of three-year notes on Tuesday . 
new issuance of U.S. corporate bonds was expected to continue to slow on Wednesday as companies waited out the U.S. Treasury &apos;s quarterly refunding this week , dealers said . 
despite the current lull , several corporations are preparing to sell new bond issues once the auctions are over , syndicate sources said .
