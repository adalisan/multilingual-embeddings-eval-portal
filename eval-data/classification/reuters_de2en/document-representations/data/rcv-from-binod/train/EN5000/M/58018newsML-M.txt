the Budapest Stock Exchange ( BSE ) closed flat as reflected by the BUX index and traders said prices were supported by the dollar &apos;s strength . 
the dollar &apos;s movements , subject to potential interest rate hikes , will remain a key factor for a while , traders said , adding they did not expect major news from the corporate side . 
&quot; The dollar &apos;s movements will influence the bourse , &quot; Attila Gazdik of New York broker Budapest said . 
&quot; Some events may influence individual companies , but news moving the whole market are unlikely . 
nevertheless , traders said , rises in PVC prices may have beneficial impact on chemical company Borsodchem &apos;s price which moved strangely today . 
in the first deal in today &apos;s session Borsodchem shares changed hands at five forints / share , a price which urged the Budapest bourse to suspend trade in the share . 
trading in the paper continued later in open outcry , instead of the otherwise fully computerised share trading . 
Borsodchem ended unchanged at 2,950 forints .
