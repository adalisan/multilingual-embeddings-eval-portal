negotiators from the Big Four trade powers -- Japan , the United States , the European Union and Canada -- are still working on a draft agreement to scrap tariffs on information technology products by the year 2000 , a Japanese government source said on Wednesday . 
&quot; They are still working on a draft declaration among the Quad ( Big Four ) , &quot; the source told Reuters . 
&quot; They are still fighting -- some working-level negotiators of some countries are getting crazy , &quot; he added . 
the Big Four late on Tuesday showed to a group of other countries interested in joining an Information Technology Agreement ( ITA ) a draft framework for the accord , but the proposal did not include the contentious area of what products precisely would be covered -- an issue over which the EU and the United States remain at odds , the source said . 
nor did the framework include a definite timetable for tariff elimination , a touchy issues for developing countries , the source said . 
&quot; Different parties have different views , &quot; the source said of the timetable issue . 
quad negotiators hope to work out their own differences ahead of another meeting with developing and other interested countries expected to take place on Wednesday afternoon , the source said . 
&quot; I am hopeful we will reach a consensus before the afternoon meeting starts , &quot; he said . 
but he declined to comment on the impact of the Big Four &apos;s appeal to others to join the ITA of any failure to reach a four-way accord . 
Japan has been strongly backing the U.S.-led initiative to forge an infotech agreement by Friday , when the World Trade Organisation concludes its first ministerial meeting . 
&quot; We want to get as wide participation as possible , &quot; another Japanese government source said .
