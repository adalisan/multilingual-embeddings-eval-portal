overnight guilders bumped back up to customary levels on Friday on the back of a new special advances pact and the start of a fresh three-month credit quota . 
dealers said call money traded most of the day at 2.75 percent although some deals were done at 2.87 percent . 
this was sharply higher than Thursday , when one-day money plunged to 2.0 percent bid as banks used up their remaining allotment on the final day of the credit quota . 
dealers said Friday &apos;s special advances allocation had been sufficient to meet market needs . 
the Dutch central bank said earlier it had allocated 2.46 billion guilders to the market under a seven-day pact . 
&quot; The amount was well-received , the market had been expecting around 2.3 billion , &quot; one dealer said . 
but another said the market was less pleased with the 10.7 percent cap on individual bank applications up to three billion guilders . 
the guilder was virtually unchanged against the mark , quoting at 112.18 per 100 marks from Thursday &apos;s 112.175 fixing .
