early calls on CME hog futures ranged from 0.100 cent per lb lower to 0.200 higher while indications on pork belly futures raised from 0.200 cent a lb lower to 0.200 higher , livestock analysts said . 
trading in both pits was expected to be choppy as traders even positions ahead of the quarterly estimated hogs and Pigs report to be released later Thursday , analysts said . 
analysts &apos; estimates for all U.S. hogs averaged 99.2 percent of a year ago in a range of 97 to 100.9 percent . 
hogs kept for breeding estimates averaged 101.4 percent and ranged 98.5 to 104 and hogs kept for market averaged 99 percent of a year ago and ranged 96 to 100.8 percent . 
effects of the Taiwan pork ban will also continue and should remain an underlying supportive factor to summer months . 
expectations are that demand for U.S. pork will be at its highest during the third quarter after other countries which import from Taiwan use up their stocks in storage , sources said . 
rolling of long April hog positions into back months ahead of its spot position next week and pressure from currently weak cash hog markets should keep the nearby under previous levels , they said . 
the latest CME lean hog index jumped $ 2.10 higher to $ 69.80 per cwt . 
the surge reflected the recent sharp rise in cash hog prices that occured after news of Taiwan &apos;s pork export ban . 
lower cash pork belly prices were cited as a selling factor in pork belly futures , but trade may be uneven as the market awaits the USDA hog report and further developments from Taiwan , analysts added .
