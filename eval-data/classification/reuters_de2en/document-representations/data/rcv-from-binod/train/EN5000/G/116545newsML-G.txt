Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said on Tuesday security concerns may prevent a regional ministerial group from visiting Burundi to assess the military junta &apos;s commitment to dialogue to end ethnic war . 
Mkapa said the team made up of foreign ministers from Tanzania , Kenya , Zaire , Cameroun and Uganda was initially scheduled to leave for Burundi on Tuesday but this had now been switched to Wednesday while security details are worked out . 
&quot; The question is how they will be received and whether security concerns will prevent them ( from arriving ) , &quot; Mkapa told a news conference . 
&quot; It is an important mission that could signal the beginning of an important breakthrough of the crisis , &quot; he added . 
the ministers had met behind closed doors in the Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam on Tuesday to plot the next move against Burundi after the ruling army junta shunned talks with Hutu rebels . 
the meeting followed Burundi &apos;s declaration on Monday that it would defy regional leaders who are demanding that the army junta talks to Hutu rebels . 
Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka told Reuters from Dar es Salaam that consultations were continuing and the foreign ministers committee mandated by heads of state to go to Burundi to assess the situation was awaiting clearance from Burundi . 
&quot; We are consulting all round , &quot; said Musyoka . 
African leaders told Burundi &apos;s military ruler Pierre Buyoya on Saturday to open unconditional talks with Hutu rebels within a month or face further sanctions . 
defying a U.S. suggestion to ease the embargo , now more than two months old , regional leaders decided to send a ministerial committee to Burundi to check on Buyoya &apos;s commitment to unconditional negotiations stated in a letter from him to the Arusha summit meeting . 
but Musyoka said his team could not leave for Burundi on Tuesday because it was still awaiting landing clearance from the military authorities in Burundi . 
at their latest summit in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha on Saturday , the regional leaders gave Burundi one month to enter negotiations with Leonard Nyangoma &apos;s Forces for the Defence of Democracy ( FDD ) and smaller Hutu armed factions . 
the leaders from Cameroun , Ethiopia , Kenya , Rwanda , Uganda , Tanzania , Zambia , Zaire and the Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) warned of penalties against any group in Burundi which refuses to negotiate within a month . 
the leaders also refused to ease economic and transport sanctions against Burundi until strongman Major Pierre Buyoya began talks with rebels fighting his Tutsi military junta . 
but the leader of Burundi &apos;s main Tutsi opposition party on Tuesday hailed Buyoya &apos;s move to reject talks with the rebels and attacked Tanzania and Kenya -- main actors in Saturday &apos;s move to maintain sanctions -- as countries bent on hitting Burundi . 
&quot; We support the government decision to reject talks with the rebels . 
it is a good move to show that we cannot be controlled or ruled by Tanzania and Kenya , &quot; Charles Mukasi , leader of the Uprona party told Reuters . 
&quot; It is Kenya and Tanzania which are supporting the Hutu genociders . 
they ( rebels ) have their headquarters in Kenya , &quot; Mukasi said . 
the embargo was imposed on landlocked Burundi on July 31 as punishment for the military coup six days earlier which installed Buyoya . 
killings by the rebels , the army , militias and even ordinary villagers occur every day in the tiny tea and coffee-growing central African state . 
human rights and aid workers estimate the killings at 1,000 monthly and over 150,000 in the past three years , including a president and an archbishop .
