the dollar , which has soared against the Japanese yen and German mark recently , was likely to keep climbing due to the strong U.S. economy , economists said Wednesday . 
analysts said the hands-off approach to the dollar by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin was both laudable and inevitable since U.S. economic prospects were so much better than overseas partners like Germany and Japan . 
&quot; It is really the superb performance of the U.S. economy against the rest of the world -- low inflation , low unemployment , the seventh year of expansion , very strong productivity -- that is making the dollar the currency to hold , &quot; said Allen Sinai , chief global economist for Primark Decision Economics Inc. in Boston . 
&quot; Market fundamentals are driving the dollar to record levels and they will take it to further highs , &quot; Sinai predicted . 
he said it was always preferable to let fundamentals &quot; call the tune &quot; in setting relative values of the dollar , the Japanese yen and the German mark . 
the dollar touched a 4-1 / 2-year high of 127 yen on Wednesday and a three-year peak of 1.7270 marks in New York trading , before giving up some of those gains . 
the dollar ended at 126.80 yen , up from 126.30 Tuesday , and at 1.7255 marks , up from 1.7155 marks . 
even lawmakers from districts hit hardest by a higher dollar , like Michigan &apos;s car manufacturing centres , doubted there was any effective way to brake the dollar . 
pushing partners like Japan to let more imports in was the favoured approach . 
&quot; As difficult as it is to successfully press Japan on opening its markets , it &apos;s even more difficult to try to control currencies directly , &quot; said Representative Sander Levin , D.-Mich. 
Levin said he and other lawmakers intended to tell Rubin in a Thursday meeting that their favoured policy remedy was a tougher approach to Japan . 
&quot; The more that direct intervention in currency markets is difficult , the more important it is that we press on these other fronts , &quot; Levin said . 
but manufacturing industries may be getting set to campaign for currency intervention , fearing the dollar &apos;s rise will price them out of foreign markets and foster a rising tide of cheaper foreign-made goods . 
Gordon Richards , an economist for the National Association of Manufacturers ( Nam ) , said 60 percent of its members complained in a survey three weeks ago that their sales and profits were being hurt by the rising dollar . 
fully 50 percent said if it went higher -- as it has done -- then the United States should actively intervene in currency markets to drive down the value of the dollar . 
Richards said association directors were meeting for three days starting Thursday , with the dollar &apos;s value certain to be discussed . 
&quot; There is abundant evidence to suggest that , in the short term , intervention can be a powerful and credible policy tool , &quot; Richards said . 
Rubin , just back from a major Asian trip that took him to Japan , the Philippines and Vietnam , has studiously avoided saying anything more than that a strong dollar restrains U.S. inflation and keeps interest rates low . 
the currency has been strong for &quot; quite some time , &quot; he always adds . 
economist Sung won Sohn of Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis said he strongly believed the Treasury &quot; should do nothing &quot; to try to directly affect currencies unless values were &quot; gyrating . 
there is no sign that imbalances are developing , he added . 
&quot; What we are seeing today and yesterday is not disorderly , &quot; Sohn said . 
&quot; A lot of people have been saying the dollar is too strong , but in the immediate future I think it &apos;ll continue to appreciate . 
&quot; The United States is now the No . 
1 productive economy in the world , &quot; Sohn said , which attracts capital and investment and adds to the dollar &apos;s luster .
