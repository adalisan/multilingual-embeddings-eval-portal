President Bill Clinton on Thursday condemned the &quot; callous &quot; killing of a British soldier by a suspected IRA gunman and urged pro-British loyalists in Northern Ireland to show restraint . 
&quot; I am grieved and outraged by the callous killing of a British soldier in Northern Ireland yesterday , &quot; Clinton said in a written statement . 
&quot; The first lady and I extend our deepest sympathy to the soldier &apos;s family and to the British government and people on the loss of this young man . 
the 23-year-old soldier was manning a checkpoint outside the village of Bessbrook in Northern Ireland when he was hit by a shot from a high velocity rifle on Wednesday night . 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility but the British and Irish governments quickly blamed the Irish Republican Army , which is fighting to oust Britain and reunite the province with the rest of Ireland . 
&quot; All those who care about the future of Northern Ireland must join me in condemning this cowardly crime , &quot; Clinton said . 
&quot; I remain convinced that the people of both of Northern Ireland &apos;s traditions want to take the path of peace and reconciliation , not hatred and violence . 
the killing was the first since the IRA bombed a British army base last October killing one soldier and injuring 30 and it put a further strain on a cease-fire by the IRA &apos;s Protestant Loyalist foes . 
&quot; The loyalists and their leaders have shown great courage and restraint in not allowing themselves to be drawn into an escalating spiral of violence . 
he said peace talks in Belfast , chaired by special U.S. envoy George Mitchell , still had his full support . 
&quot; I urge all those taking part , who share a commitment to democratic values , to move as rapidly as possible into substantive negotiation about the future of Northern Ireland , &quot; Clinton said . 
U.S. officials have denied British media reports that Clinton is shifting his position on Ireland and may be backing away from the accommodating position he earlier took towards Sinn Fein , the IRA &apos;s political wing . 
the reports were linked with rumors in Britain that Clinton was to replace the U.S. envoy in Dublin , Jean Kennedy Smith . 
on Thursday newspapers in Britain and Ireland said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had canceled a meeting with Britain &apos;s Northern Ireland Secretary during her visit to London next week due to anger at what has been interpreted in Washington as British attempts to manipulate U.S. policy . 
a heavyweight bipartisan congressional delegation , led by Benjamin Gilman , chairman of the House of Representatives International Relations Committee , was due to fly to Belfast on Friday as part of a European tour . 
Dan Michaelis , spokesman for New York Republican Peter King , a delegation member long involved in Irish affairs , said the trip would send a message that Washington &quot; will remain engaged in a positive way to encourage the peace process . 
he said the 15-member delegation would meet officials from all political groups in Northern Ireland , including Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams . 
they would spend Friday night in Dublin , including a meeting with Irish Prime Minister John Bruton , and travel on to London for further discussions on Ireland with Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine before going on to Bonn , Strasburg and Brussels .
