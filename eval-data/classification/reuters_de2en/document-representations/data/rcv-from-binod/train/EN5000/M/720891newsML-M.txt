any investor optimism on the London stock market will be put to the test on Thursday following last night &apos;s plunge on Wall Street , technical analysts said . 
the FTSE 100 index will be thrown off guard by the 119 point plunge on the Dow , which ended at 7,842.43 on Wednesday , and the immediate reaction in London will be a mark down , so that the FTSE may touch the region of around 4,730 , initially . 
but a defiant gesture from bargain hunters may save the day later on to take the FTSE back up to 4,660 . 
the index will once again test its 10-day moving average -- now at 4,736 -- which is beginning to flatten out and indicates a near-term consolidation phase for the market , analysts said . 
this is despite the market &apos;s trend for making lower intra-day lows so far this week . 
a trendline connecting these lows has been falling at a rate of 15.5 points per day and a parallel line which connects the FTSE &apos;s intra-day highs this week indicates the market is capable of travelling in a 47- point range . 
&quot; The market will remain cautious ( near-term ) but may show resilience near 4,730 , &quot; said one analyst . 
&quot; But it still needs to clear 4,780 for a fighting chance to move higher -- and this does not seem likely over the next few days , &quot; he added .
