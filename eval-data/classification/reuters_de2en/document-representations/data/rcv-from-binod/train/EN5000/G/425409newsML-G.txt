sacked Indonesian legislator Sri Bintang Pamungkas , ousted from parliament and convicted of defaming President Suharto , has been detained on subversion charges , his wife said on Thursday . 
Bintang &apos;s wife Erna told Reuters her husband was officially detained late on Wednesday along with two other leaders of his fledgling United Democratic Party of Indonesia ( PUDI ) on subversion charges . 
&quot; He was telephoned at 8 a.m. ( on Wednesday ) by officials from the Attorney-General &apos;s office and told they wanted to discuss PUDI and his agenda on his EID al-Fitr card , &quot; Erna said . 
in cards sent last month to mark the Moslem festival of EID al-Fitr , Bintang also enclosed the programmes of the unrecognised party he set up last year , regarding the general elections . 
the party urged Indonesians to boycott the general elections and reject possible re-election of President Suharto in presidential polls next year . 
Erna said the three men went voluntarily to the Attorney-General &apos;s office for further questioning around 2 p.m. 
&quot; He then telephoned at 10 p.m. saying he was waiting to see if he would be detained or not , &quot; she said . 
&quot; The letter of detention had not yet been completed but there was already an order that he be detained by the President because he rejected the general election , &quot; she said , adding Bintang then telephoned 30 minutes later to confirm his detention .
