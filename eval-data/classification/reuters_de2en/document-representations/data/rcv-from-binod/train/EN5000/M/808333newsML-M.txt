Argentine bonds finished higher Tuesday , helped by the U.S. Federal Reserve &apos;s decision to hold U.S. interest rates steady . 
but traders underlined that the market saw very little activity with most now predicting a gradual climb after recent losses . 
&quot; The market is slightly long . 
nobody is in a hurry to buy at these levels , &quot; said a trader at a local bank . 
Argentina &apos;s FRB Brady bond was up 1 / 8 at 95-1 / 2 while the par bond rose 1 / 4 to 74-1 / 8 . 
another trader predicted the market &quot; will come back slowly . 
despite the Federal Reserve &apos;s decision to hold rates steady , the Argentine market is likely to continue to focus on U.S. markets , considering their recent volatility .
