Bank of England governor Eddie George said his view on British interest rates in the past few months had remained unchanged , implying that he was not in favour of tightening or easing monetary policy . 
when asked by reporters whether his view on interest rates had changed , George replied : &quot; No . 
speaking at a Bank of England seminar on post-1997 Hong Kong monetary arrangements , George said UK inflation pressures were still subdued in the short term . 
&quot; I expect inflation to be fairly benign in the short run , &quot; he said . 
but he added : &quot; We expect to see domestic demand feeding into output . 
&quot; A survey released early on Tuesday by the British Retail Consortium pointed to &quot; strong healthy growth in domestic demand &quot; , he added . 
the question as to whether there was any need to tighten rates depended on how rapid the outurn would be , George said .
