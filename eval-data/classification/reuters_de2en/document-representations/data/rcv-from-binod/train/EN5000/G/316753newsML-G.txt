Reformists from Bulgaria &apos;s ruling Socialists joined a new rival leftist group on Saturday in a sign the party might split under the strain of 13 days of popular unrest . 
mired in a deep economic crisis , the government of former communists held out against protests demanding early elections led by the Union of Democratic Forces ( UDF ) , who remained adamant that they would not tolerate any new Socialist cabinet . 
students danced in Sofia &apos;s streets , ethnic Turks and Gypsies held rallies and taxis jammed the Danube town of Rousse to protest against economic misery and for elections not constitutionally required for almost another two years . 
President-elect Petar Stoyanov , due to be sworn in on Sunday , says he might offer the Socialists the new ruling mandate denied them by his predecessor Zhelyu Zhelev . 
but moves by Socialist dissidents on Saturday fuelled opposition hopes that enough deputies would vote against it to force dissolution of parliament and polls as early as March . 
the New Left in Bulgaria coalition , proposed by the Bulgarian Socialist Party ( BSP ) reformist wing and a small , liberal Marxist party , brings them together with other leftist organisations and four deputies who left the BSP on Thursday . 
&quot; I am here because of an illusion and because of a dream , &quot; Socialist deputy Nikolai Kamov , head of parliament &apos;s foreign policy and European integration committee , told the founding meeting . 
&quot; The illusion is that the BSP is able to evolve to accept the values and political practices of the European Left ... My dream was that children born around 1989 would be able to get European passports when they turned 18 . 
&quot; I think the next week will be decisive for the development of Bulgaria . 
if we can come together from the left and the right , we shall succeed . 
the BSP , made up largely of former communists who renamed the party after the end of one-party rule in 1989 , registered a mere eight percent support in one opinion poll this week and would be almost certain to lose any elections held soon . 
new Left in Bulgaria set up an organising committee led by liberal Marxist politician Alexander Tomov , who told the meeting : &quot; The Bulgarian Left has not done as we wanted , as they did in Hungary and Poland &quot; . 
Dimitar Yonchev , one of the four defecting BSP deputies , called New Left social democratic . 
&quot; We are for transparent privatisation . 
we want a solid group of owners in society and we support a Euro-Atlantic orientation for Bulgaria . 
the ruling party has barely begun reform of the crumbling state-run economy and is lukewarm on EU and NATO membership , not wanting to upset its allies in Moscow . 
but Yonchev said the opposition , too , lacked constructive policies . 
the new coalition wanted a broad-based interim government of technocrats to rule until elections , under either a Socialist or opposition mandate , he said . 
UDF chairman Ivan Kostov met outgoing president Zhelev on Saturday and said a Socialist attempt to cling to power would do further damage to an economy stricken by inflation of more than 300 percent , seeking rescue by the IMF and World Bank . 
&quot; An attempt to form a Socialist government , which will waste several months and then fall , will thwart any possible agreements with international lending institutions in the first months of the summer , which will inevitably lead to default on foreign debt , &quot; he said . 
Kostov called for an interim government to negotiate with international bodies on a strict monetary regime and pave the way for polls which he said could be held by the end of March . 
if not , he added , &quot; we expect trade unions to react with a serious nationwide strike accompanied by strong political protests &quot; . 
strikes so far have been brief symbolic stoppages . 
government officials appear nervous that the president-elect &apos;s inauguration could be a flashpoint for a showdown like one a week ago , when protesters ransacked parliament and clashes with police left 196 injured . 
the Socialists said talks with the opposition could resume after Stoyanov becomes president . 
the opposition is boycotting parliament but says it will attend his inauguration .
