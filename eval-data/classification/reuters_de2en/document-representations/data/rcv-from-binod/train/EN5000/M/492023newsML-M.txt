temperatures dipped in the High Plains early Monday but conditions were not cold enough to cause any significant damage to the hard red winter wheat crop , dealers said . 
&quot; I spoke to four customers in northwest Kansas this morning and they told me the wheat is not at a point where it ( cold ) will cause any problems , &quot; one Kansas dealer said . 
another dealer in western Kansas said moisture remained more of a concern than the cold temperatures . 
there was again no signficiant moisture in the area over the weekend , the dealer added . 
dealers said in Oklahoma the wheat is more advanced and therefore more susceptible to a cold snap but temperatures were not as low as in Kansas .
