the dollar is expected to drift in Asian trading time on Monday , hit hard by a lack of players on the last trading day of the year , with upward moves likely to be capped just under 116 yen on profit-taking , dealers said . 
Friday &apos;s New York trade saw the dollar surge to near 45-month highs on the yen , to 116.20 yen , before drifting slightly lower . 
concerns about the weakness of Japanese stocks and the economy continued to buoy the U.S. currency . 
Tokyo dealers said that while few people will be interested in active yen buying , some profit-taking sales of the dollar just under 116 yen should prevent rises during the day . 
dealers said the most active operators in Tokyo on Monday are likely to be trading and securities firms , with limited participation from Japanese banks . 
most exporters have already begun New Year holidays , making Singapore operators likely to be among the most active participants during the day . 
&quot; The big thing to watch for today is at what level will the profit-taking against the yen emerge , as this is expected to set the pace for dollar / mark trade as well , &quot; a trust bank dealer said . 
the yen is expected to remain weak in the crosses , particularly against the mark and the pound , he added . 
this yen weakness is expected to continue in overseas trade , where brisk yen sales have been the hallmark of the past few trading days , one dealer said , adding that overseas trade is likely to be much more active than that in Tokyo . 
the fact that the dollar was up from its Friday New York close in early Asian trade , to 115.60 / 70 yen from 115.25 / 35 yen , meant that even should active profit-taking emerge , the dollar was unlikely to dip below 115 yen , he added . 
trade against the mark is expected to be quiet in the absence of fresh trading factors , with the dollar &apos;s moves against the yen likely to lead trade .
