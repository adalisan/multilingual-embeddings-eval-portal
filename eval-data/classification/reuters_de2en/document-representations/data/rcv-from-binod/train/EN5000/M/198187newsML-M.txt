jet fuel premiums in Singapore have risen to trade above prevailing spot prices on renewed buying from North Asia for the winter , industry sources said on Monday . 
on Friday , one 30,000-tonne cargo was sold for mid-December lifting at a 10-cent premium to Singapore spot quotes , on a free-on-board ( fob ) basis , they said . 
the sale compared favourably with earlier deals done for November lifting cargoes which were sold at parity or up to 20 cents below Singapore spot quotes , fob basis , traders said . 
the market was boosted by buying for November and December cargoes by Japan and China . 
in the middle of last week , one Japanese refiner bought two 30,000-tonne cargoes for December delivery at between 1.60 and 1.65 a barrel above Singapore spot quotes on a cost-and-freight ( c-and-f ) basis , 10 cents above the previous deal . 
Japan has so far bought around five spot cargoes for arrival in December , one more than November . 
it has already bought two spot cargoes for arrival in January . 
on its part , China last week bought two cargoes a premium of between $ 1.30 and $ 1.40 on a c-and-f basis , traders said . 
one 35,000-tonne cargo was to be delivered to Northern China during end-November , while a smaller 25,000-tonne cargo was to be deliverd to Southern China in early December , a Chinese state-owned trader said . 
the cargoes were sold below c-and-f Japan prices due to cheaper freight costs of about 30 cents , traders said . 
traders said South Korea also recently bought about four jet fuel cargoes for delivery in December . 
these sales also boosted fixed price deals in Singapore with a 100,000-barrel cargo traded on November 14 at $ 30.95 a barrel fob Singapore , up 40 cents from the previous deal done a day earlier . 
but prices slipped last Friday to around $ 30.70 / $ 30.80 per barrel on softer crude values .
