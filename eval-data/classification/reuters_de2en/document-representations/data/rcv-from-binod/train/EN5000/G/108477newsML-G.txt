strong support from women and seniors gives President Bill Clinton a fighting chance to win the state of Florida in the Nov . 5 election , a victory that could deal a fatal blow to Republican Bob Dole . 
Clinton leads narrowly here less than a month before the vote -- great news for the Democratic president , who seems poised to win re-election even without Florida , and terrible for Dole , for whom this should be a reliable Republican base . 
U.S. presidential elections are actually 51 separate elections in each of the states and the District of Columbia . 
the winner in each state gains that state &apos;s votes in the Electoral College , where a 270-vote majority prevails . 
Florida is the fourth biggest state with 25 electoral votes . 
it has gone to the Republicans in nine of the past 11 presidential elections , including every one since 1980 . 
&quot; If Clinton wins Florida ... he wins the whole shooting match , &quot; said Richard SCHER , a political scientist at the University of Florida . 
&quot; Even if he doesn &apos;t win , he gains by forcing Dole to spend valuable time and money in a state that ought to be solidly in his pocket by now . 
White House aides say Clinton views winning Florida as a personal challenge . 
he only narrowly lost here to then-President George Bush in 1992 despite spending little time or money in the state , and aides say the loss rankles . 
&quot; We are fighting as hard as we possibly can for every vote in Florida , &quot; said Vice President Al Gore . 
&quot; The response we &apos;re getting is coming not just from Democrats but from record numbers of Republicans ... 
I think the Dole campaign may be in for a surprise where Florida is concerned . 
Florida was once solidly Democratic but that started changing 20 years ago . 
in 1980 , there were 1.4 million Republicans and 3.1 Democrats , although Ronald Reagan still began the current string of Republican wins here that year . 
last year , there were 3.1 million Republicans and 3.5 million Democrats . 
Floridians like to tell outsiders their state is a cross-section of America . 
Northern Florida is similar to the rest of the deep South , where conservative voters have largely abandoned the Democratic Party for the Republicans . 
Central Florida has seen a large influx of retirees and other newcomers from the Midwest , many of whom are conservative-minded and also vote Republican . 
South Florida around Miami has large enclaves of Cubans , passionately devoted to the Republicans , and senior citizens , many of them Jewish , who may constitute the most reliable Democratic constituency in the state . 
but in the past two years , Clinton has succeeded in gaining a beachhead within the Republican coalition by peeling away seniors and women and some Hispanics , said Susan McManus , a political scientist at the University of South Florida . 
&quot; Democrats have chipped away a certain portion of elder women , both Republican and independent , by using the issues of Medicare and Social Security , &quot; she said referring to the programmes that provide a safety net for the old and sick . 
&quot; For younger women , Clinton has scored with his emphasis on education , college loans and opposition to gun control and the environment , &quot; she said . 
for seniors , Dole &apos;s age of 73 has also been a problem . 
&quot; They are aware of the effects of age on themselves and they are wary voting for a man of 73 , &quot; McManus said . 
Robert Joffee , a public opinion expert with the Mason-Dixon polling company , said Clinton was the beneficiary of a huge gender gap , with white women backing him by 51 percent to 37 percent . 
among white women registered as independents , Clinton leads by 54 percent to 24 percent . 
Joffee &apos;s polling has also found Dole suffering from high negative ratings . 
he was viewed favourably by 42 percent of Floridians but unfavourably by 41 percent . 
the senior vote is more significant in Florida than anywhere else in America . 
in the 1990 census , 23 percent of the state populace was 60 or over and 8 percent 75 or more . 
seniors vote in greater numbers than any other age group -- the over-65s could make up a third of the state &apos;s voters on Nov . 5 -- and they vote their pocketbooks . 
many are angry at perceived Republican plans to cut Medicare and Medicaid , although Republicans insist Democrats have distorted this issue precisely to scare the seniors .
