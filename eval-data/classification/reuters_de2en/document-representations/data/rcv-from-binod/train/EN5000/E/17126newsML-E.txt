the index of U.S. consumer confidence rose to a new six-year high of 109.4 in August from a revised reading of 107.0 in July , the Conference Board said on Tuesday . 
the expectations component of the August index rose to 97.7 from a revised 95.0 in the previous month , and the current conditions component was up at 126.9 versus a revised reading of 125.0 in July . 
the survey shows consumer attitudes &quot; may be on an upward trend after remaining stagnant for more than a year , &quot; the Conference Board said . 
the survey showed mixed expectations for job availability . 
twenty-three percent of families said jobs are &quot; hard to get , &quot; up slightly from July , while 15 percent said they expect more jobs to become available during the next six months , up from 14 percent in July . 
the Conference Board said consumer confidence &quot; is higher now than at any time since early 1990 . 
confidence rose in most regions of the United States compared with readings at this time last year . 
the Pacific Coast rose most dramatically , climbing nearly 24 percent compared with the June , July or August figures in 1995 , the Board said . 
the only region showing a decline was the Rocky Mountain area , down about 3.0 percent .
