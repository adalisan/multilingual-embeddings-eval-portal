Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai met on Sunday night at their border to hammer out details of a Hebron agreement , witnesses said . 
&quot; tonight &apos;s meeting will concentrate on the substance of certain security issues . 
President Arafat and Minister Mordechai will be discussing and trying to bridge the gap , &quot; chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told reporters beforehand . 
Israeli and PLO officials have said they expect Arafat and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to sign an agreement giving the Palestinians control of 80 percent of Hebron by Tuesday , the end of the year . 
Hebron is the last of seven occupied West Bank cities Israel agreed to give self-rule under an agreement signed with the PLO in 1995 . 
U.S. President Bill Clinton &apos;s Middle East envoy Dennis Ross was due back in the region on Monday to mediate any last-minute snags and attend the signing . 
security concerns have held up the handover in Hebron , including demands by Netanyahu for additional measures he says are needed to protect the 400 Jewish settlers in the heart of the town of 100,000 Arabs .
