the ringgit treaded quietly despite the dollar &apos;s top-heavy range against the yen , dealers said . 
a lack of local direction and mixed views on ringgit corporate demand , kept the Malaysian currency in a narrow band . 
&quot; Absolutely nothing happened . 
I think the market &apos;s waiting for direction , &quot; said one market analyst . 
the dollar was choppy in Asia , falling more than one full yen on Japanese corporate repatriation into yen . 
dealers gave mixed immediate views on the ringgit . 
expectations that Japanese multinationals have begun selling ringgit for dollars ahead of the Japanese year-end book closings in March may weaken the ringgit . 
but this is balanced by bullish medium-term views of the ringgit and talk of ringgit-demand from Malaysian corporates . 
at the Kuala Lumpur close at 1000 GMT , ringgit was at 2.4820 / 30 a dollar from 2.4830 / 55 at the Thursday close .
