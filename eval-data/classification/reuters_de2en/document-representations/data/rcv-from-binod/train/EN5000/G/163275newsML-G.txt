African leaders will grapple with the dramatic dimensions of the conflict in eastern Zaire on Tuesday but are so far resisting European pressure to intervene militarily . 
the potential scale of the crisis , threatening the break-up of the continent &apos;s second-largest country and with the lives of more than a million Rwandan refugees in the balance , is a daunting agenda for what is slated as a one-day summit . 
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi , hosting the session in Nairobi , will meet at least seven other leaders and the head of the 54-nation Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) . 
on the eve of the summit , the Banyamulenge Tutsi rebels announced a three-week unilateral ceasefire to allow the Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire to return to Rwanda and Burundi . 
Zaire &apos;s shaky government repeated on Monday it would boycott the Nairobi summit and all other talks until Rwandan troops are off its soil . 
Rwanda , Burundi and Uganda deny they are backing the ethnic Tutsi rebels scoring one victory after another against Zaire &apos;s ramshackle army . 
but numerous foreign witnesses saw Rwandan troops in the Zairean city of Goma last weekend . 
the European Union ( EU ) , whose member states include all the former colonial powers in Africa , proposed last week that the OAU raise a military force to go into Zaire after a ceasefire and on humanitarian grounds . 
the people most at risk are more than one million refugees from Rwanda &apos;s majority Hutu tribe , living in eastern Zaire since they fled in 1994 fearing retribution for the genocide of minority Tutsis . 
the refugees , pushed by the fighting into hellish mega-camps where cholera could erupt at any time , have so far refused to go back to Rwanda . 
but Zaire does not want them and without a major military-backed humanitarian operation they face death from disease in their Hutu Alamos . 
France called on Monday for quick international talks on creating stability in Zaire &apos;s North and South Kivu provinces so refugees could return to the camps there . 
but neither the rebels , nor the Tutsi military leaderships in Rwanda and Burundi , will want the camps reopened . 
neither the OAU nor any African leader has said they are willing or able to send a military force , even if the EU and the United States foot the bill . 
how do you mobilise an African force -- harmonising logistics , supplies , transportation , chain of command -- in such a short time ? 
&quot; queried David Kikaya , a Kenyan foreign ministry official , before news of the rebel ceasefire offer . 
the rebels say their goal is to topple Zaire &apos;s ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko . 
rebel sympathisers will push at the summit for Zaire to recognise the Banyamulenge as full citizens , saying the conflict has its roots in Zaire &apos;s refusal to treat them as equals despite up to 200 years &apos; residency . 
Kikaya voiced the view of many in Africa that the EU and wealthy nations are passing the buck by advocating a solo African military intervention . 
&quot; It means you are trying to marginalise Africa . 
when it &apos;s an African problem let Africa deal with it . 
when it &apos;s a problem outside Africa , let the United Nations deal with it . 
we are all members of the U.N. , &quot; Kikaya told Reuters . 
Kenya expects the presidents or prime ministers of Eritrea , Ethiopia , Rwanda , Tanzania , Uganda and Zambia , the OAU secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim and Cameroon &apos;s foreign minister . 
that group excludes five of Zaire &apos;s nine neighbours . 
Kenyan officials say Moi is consulting with other African leaders . 
one result could be the scrapping of South Africa &apos;s controversial arms and military hardware sale to the mainly Tutsi Rwandan army . 
Moi urged South African President Nelson Mandela , in a telephone conversation on Sunday , to suspend the $ 18.5 million deal until Rwandan troops leave Zaire . 
a South African minister said on Monday his government would be guided by leaders of the Great Lakes region -- an imprecise group of central African states . 
any agreement in Nairobi on Tuesday will need to overcome sharp policy differences between leaders about the genesis of the broader Hutu-Tutsi crisis and its solution . 
the poison in those ethnic relations has spread from Rwanda and Burundi to Zaire , all three former Belgian colonies .
