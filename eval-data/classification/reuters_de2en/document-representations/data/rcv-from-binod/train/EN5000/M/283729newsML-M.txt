Colombian stocks edged higher led by bank stocks in markets still sluggish after the Christmas and New Year break . 
Bogota &apos;s IBB index closed 0.15 percent up at 844.41 amid a 281 million peso volume , limited to just seven stocks . 
Medellin &apos;s IBOMED general price index gained 0.32 percent closing at 13,466.54 amid a 679 million peso volume , in a session where just six different stocks were traded . 
&quot; It &apos;s obvious the markets are still affected by the New Year holidays when many shareholders and brokers leave the city and switch off from business , &quot; one Bogota broker said . 
on the Bogota exchange , Banco de Colombia rose 0.72 percent to 418 . 
the bulk of the session &apos;s volume was concentrated in brewing giant Bavaria , which ended unchanged at 4,100 in total trade of 142 million pesos . 
Bancoquia bank , in which Spain &apos;s Grupo Santander will shortly complete the purchase of a 55 percent stake , fell back 2.72 percent to 2,500 . 
Banco Ganadero climbed 5.47 percent to 270 on the Medellin exchange amid a flurry of demand from small investors . 
the day &apos;s volume was concentrated in a 445 million peso trade in supermarket chain Almacenes Exito , unchanged at 3,100 . 
&quot; We don &apos;t think the 1996 inflation figure will be good news for the stock market because it means interest rates are likely to remain high . 
that means investors are unlikely to turn their gaze to the stock market for the time being at least , &quot; another Bogot broker said . 
the National Statistics Department announced the consumer price index rose 21.63 percent in 1996 , outstripping the government target of 17 percent .
