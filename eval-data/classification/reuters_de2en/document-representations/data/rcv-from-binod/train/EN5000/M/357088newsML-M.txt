Commonwealth Bank of Australia ( CBA ) announced on Wednesday that it has been mandated to arrange the first Kangaroo issue for a Hong Kong issuer . 
Asian debt markets were otherwise quiet as activity in financial markets slowed before the long Lunar New Year holiday , which starts on Thursday . 
Kangaroo bonds and notes are debt instruments issued by foreign borrowers in the Australian domestic market . 
up to now , issuance has been exclusively by Korean banks . 
the Hong Kong borrower is GE Capital Finance , which is wholly owned by AAA-rated General Electric Capital Corp , which in turn is 100 percent held by General Electric Co of the United States . 
GE Capital Finance is one of 37 restricted licence banks operating in Hong Kong . 
it has a long-term foreign currency rating of Single-A from Standard and Poor &apos;s Corp , equal to Hong Kong &apos;s sovereign ceiling . 
CBA expects the issue to be fully placed before its launch in late February . 
Andrew Fung , head of capital markets at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Hong Kong , said the issue offers GE Capital Finance a way to diversify its funding at a good price . 
at current swap rates , bankers said the FRN &apos;s yield to investors roughly translates into 36 basis points over the Hong Kong Interbank offered offered Rate . 
even with fees , which have not been disclosed , that rate is expected to be less than what the borrower paid last year for a Hong Kong dollar floating rate certificate of deposit issue . 
as for investors in Australia , &quot; they get the added yield of Hong Kong sovereign risk without any corporate risk because the parent is rated AAA &quot; , said Fung , adding &quot; we think this is a good way to introduce Australian investors to Hong Kong credits &quot; . 
he noted that the size of the issue was constrained by the borrower &apos;s needs , not by demand . 
Fung also said that he expects Australian investors will be willing to take Hong Kong companies &apos; corporate risk -- as long the companies are investment grade -- as well as Hong Kong sovereign risk in the near future . 
bankers said Thai Farmers Bank and Bangkok Bank are taking a look at the Kangaroo market . 
South Korea &apos;s Cho hung Bank reportedly has a cast an eye in that direction as well , but bankers noted that most Korean issues are on hold right now . 
in other news from Hong Kong , bankers said the syndicated loan issues for Kerry Holdings and Cheung Kong and the debut floating rate note issue for Hysan Development will be launched into general syndication shortly after the lunar new year holidays . 
Hong Kong financial markets will re-open on Monday , February 10 . 
some markets in the region will be closed for a longer period of time .
