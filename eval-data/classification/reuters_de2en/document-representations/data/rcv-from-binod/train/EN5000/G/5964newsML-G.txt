the Dayton accord is being badly implemented , forcing loyal citizens to accept in peace what they fought against in war , Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said in a speech on Wednesday . 
his remarks cast doubt on the legitimacy of the Bosnian peace process and of nationwide elections scheduled for September 14 . 
&quot; No one can expect us to legalise something that we have been fighting against and ask us to accept the results of a war of conquest and genocide , &quot; Izetbegovic told an international conference on post-war Bosnia . 
&quot; A hesitant , inconsistent and insufficient implementation of the Dayton agreement just leads to that . 
as days go by our doubts and questions are multiplying . 
Dayton brought an end to the 43-month Bosnian war last December and set a course for the country &apos;s reunification as a unitary , multi-ethnic state within its pre-war borders . 
Bosnia &apos;s three armies were supposed to stand down , freedom of movement was meant to be restored and refugees were guaranteed the right to return to homes from which had been ethnically cleansed . 
the peace process was then to culminate in free and fair elections to establish common institutions to bind Bosnians together in a decentralized state comprised of a Moslem-Croat federation and a Serb republic . 
the deployment of 53,000 NATO-led combat troops forced Bosnia &apos;s three armies to return to barracks and store their weapons and ammunition in cantonment areas open to inspection . 
by comparison , the civilian side of the Dayton agreement has limped forward with constant obstruction from Bosnia &apos;s three main nationalist parties . 
hardline separatist Croats and Serbs have not abandoned their desire to break-away from Bosnia . 
while Izetbegovic &apos;s Moslem nationalist SDA party preached multi-ethnicity during the war it too is drifting away from that position under constant pressure from Croats and Serbs whose mono-ethnic politics are proving contagious . 
the SDA &apos;s commitment to a unitary state now appears based more on territorial ambition than ethnic tolerance . 
these communal tensions have stymied freedom of movement , making it virtually impossible for refugees to return to their homes across what have become de facto ethnic boundary lines . 
even the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe which is supervising the elections admits there is little prospect of the vote being free or fair . 
by most accounts the nationalist parties will win handily , with the Croats and Serbs interpreting the result as a referendum endorsing their partition policies rather than reunification . 
&quot; We cannot afford to lose in peace what we have defended with our blood in the hard years of the war , &quot; Izetbegovic told his audience on Wednesday . 
&quot; Our goal is an integral and democratic Bosnia and Hercegovina and a stable peace .
