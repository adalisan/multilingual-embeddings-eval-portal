Swiss gross domestic product ( GDP ) was unchanged on an annualised , seasonally-adjusted basis in the fourth quarter of 1996 compared with the third quarter , the Federal Office for Economic Policy said on Tuesday . 
the third-quarter decline was revised to 0.6 percent from the 0.7 percent originally reported . 
for all of 1996 , GDP fell 0.7 percent compared with 1995 , extending a slide that has kept the economy basically stagnant since 1990 . 
the economic office &apos;s director said it expected a modest upturn in 1997 . 
&quot; We expect a rise in 1997 GDP of around 0.5 percent , &quot; director Hans Sieber told Reuters . 
he said fourth-quarter 1996 data showing GDP stagnated compared with the third quarter indicated that the economy was moving through its trough in the winter semester 1996 / 97 . 
&quot; We assume that the second half of 1997 will be better . 
in particular we expect positive momentum for foreign demand in light of significantly better exchange rates as well as somewhat better economic perspectives in Europe , &quot; he said . 
this momentum will not be enough , however , to spark a self-sustaining rebound in a domestic economy still undergoing deep structural changes , he added . 
&quot; For 1997 we expect only modest overall economic growth , in the first semester continuing stagnation but in the second semester clearly better results . 
we are emerging from stagnation but one should not be too optimistic .
