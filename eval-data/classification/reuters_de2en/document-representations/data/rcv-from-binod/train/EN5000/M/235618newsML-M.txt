Asia &apos;s liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) buyers are reeling from decade-high prices set by Saudi Arabia , the world &apos;s largest LPG exporter , as the northern hemisphere winter begins , industry sources said on Wednesday . 
Saudi LPG prices in December soared to the highest level in a decade at $ 310 per tonne , up more than US $ 100 from a year ago . 
the sources said prices of LPG , which is used for home heating , cooking and for making plastics , have soared on rising demand from India and China , coupled with a huge drawdown of stocks in the United States because of the cold weather . 
the high prices have forced upset term buyers in Japan , South Korea and Taiwan to reduce imports . 
Japan , which imports up to 70 percent of Saudi Arabian LPG export , or 10 million tonnes a year , has already suffered losses of up to $ 3.00 a tonne since April when the price rise began , Japanese sources said . 
&quot; The price rise has prompted retailers and wholesalers to seriously consider adjusting domestic prices , which have never been changed for the past 10 to 15 years , upwards , &quot; a trading source in Japan said . 
earlier this month , an official with Japan &apos;s Agency of Natural Resources and Energy told Reuters in Tokyo the agency was considering easing stockpile requirements for LPG importers by mid-December due to high prices . 
a Japanese law requires LPG importers to maintain stockpiles equivalent to a minimum of 50 days of imports or about two million tonnes . 
but most buyers are unwilling to pay the high prices to meet demand and the stockpile requirement , said a Japanese trader . 
a source from state-owned Indian Oil Corp ( IOC ) told Reuters that the company was in a dilemma -- either it met demand and &quot; blow the budget &quot; or left customers short of supplies . 
&quot; If prices continue to rise , we cannot afford to pay , &quot; the IOC source said . 
buyers in China are also worried . 
while domestic retail prices have already risen to around 4,000 yuan ( $ 482 ) per tonne , compared with 3,000 yuan one month ago , international prices are still too high for buyers to cope , they said . 
a trader in Hong Kong said Chinese imports were expected to be halved in December from November volumes . 
traders said Asian buyers hoping to find relief in January &apos;s prices were likely to be disappointed . 
they said LPG prices were likely to peak in February ahead of the festive season when the Chinese Lunar New Year coincides with the Moslem religious holidays of EID al-Fitr . 
&quot; Demand for cooking and heating fuels is expected to go through the roof during that season , &quot; said a Singapore trader .
