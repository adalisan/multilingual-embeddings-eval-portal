CBOT corn futures closed higher on a decline last week in the condition rating for the U.S. crop and on uncertain weather patterns in the U.S. Midwest , traders said . 
&quot; There is uncertainty over the weather . 
the silking ( pollination ) continues to lag expectations so it &apos;s stretching out the time some damage can be done , &quot; said FIMAT futures analyst Dan Cekander . 
the corn silking or pollination pace as of Sunday stood at 21 percent , below the 22 percent of a year ago and well below the 32 percent average pace . 
USDA said Monday that as of Sunday the U.S. corn crop was 68 percent good to excellent , below the 73 percent in that category the previous week . 
the market was expecting a two to three percentage point decline in the corn ratings , not a five percentage point drop . 
corn closed 1 / 2 to 2-1 / 4 cents per bushel higher , with September up 2-1 / 4 at $ 2.47-1 / 2 . 
December was up 1-3 / 4 at $ 2.48-1 / 2 . 
old crop July corn expired quietly at 1201 CDT Tuesday and settled 7-1 / 4 higher at $ 2.71 . 
the volatile weather patterns again came to the forefront this week . 
weather Services Corp said rains fell across central Illinois Monday , but amounts and coverage were lighter than expected . 
&quot; We had a little more rain yesterday , but again , I don &apos;t think it was enough to end the drought concerns , &quot; WSC meteorologist Mike Palmerino said . 
it was a little bit disappointing . 
it could have produced better than it did .
