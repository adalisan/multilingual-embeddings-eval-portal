the Peruvian military has arrested a retired general who has frequently accused the army and intelligence services of human rights abuses including the use of death squads , officials said on Tuesday . 
&quot; Gen. ( Rodolfo ) Robles has been arrested at the request of the Supreme Military Justice Council ... for insubordination , &quot; Congress &apos; Vice President Carlos Torres told reporters . 
Robles &apos; family , however , claimed on national radio the arrest was more like a kidnapping as eight people grabbed the retired general , bundled him into a car and sprayed an aerosol can in his face to stop him from shouting . 
Robles has frequently spoken out against Peru &apos;s military since he said an army &quot; death squad &quot; killed 10 students and a university teacher in 1992 . 
he went into exile in Argentina to avoid trial after this accusation but later returned to Peru when the government granted him amnesty . 
recently he said at least one member of the same &quot; death squad &quot; had attacked a local television station . 
the government admitted the attack included military personnel .
