strong gains in Czech Komercni Banka moved the Prague Stock Exchange &apos;s PX50 index higher for a fourth straight session , as the bank &apos;s U.S. agent won approval to convert more Komercni shares into global depositary receipts ( GDRs ) . 
the official PX50 index finished the week 23.4 points , or 2.12 percent higher , at 514.5 points , while the Reuters Prague 11-share RPIX index gained 53.3 points , or 5.24 percent , since last Friday to close at 1,069.8 . 
Komercni , the largest Czech commercial bank , rose 106 crowns to 1,854 as Bank of New York received an approval from the Czech National Bank to convert another three percent of Komercni &apos;s shares into global depositary receipts ( GDR ) . 
currently 10 percent of Komercni &apos;s shares are converted through the U.S. bank . 
dealers said Komercni shares rose sharply ahead of the midday GDR announcement in Prague , which came first when Komercni &apos;s spokeswoman was asked by Reuters to comment on market rumours that the decision had been taken . 
traders said they were convinced that the decision was already in the market , but it was not clear from where the information originated . 
one Prague trader said demand for Komercni shares was strong from abroad , and said the news of the raise of the GDR limit was first known overseas . 
&quot; In the morning , orders from abroad appeared .... the first ones to start buying were foreign firms , &quot; said the dealer who spoke on the condition of anonymity . 
&quot; I think that the news was first in the States , earlier than here , &quot; he said . 
elsewhere , telephone monopoly SPT Telecom rose 100 crowns on Friday to 3,710 in heavy activity still driven by fundamental confidence in the issue . 
&quot; In SPT demand is continually strong from abroad , &quot; said Pavel Ruzicka , a trader at Patria Finance . 
petrochemical shares also recorded gains , with Chemopetrol Group rising 40 crowns to 1,219 and Kaucuk Group adding 15 crowns to 1,316 . 
overall on the bourse , 123 issues gained , 76 lost and 45 held unchanged on Friday . 
a total of 914,690 shares changed hands on turnover of 842 million crowns .
