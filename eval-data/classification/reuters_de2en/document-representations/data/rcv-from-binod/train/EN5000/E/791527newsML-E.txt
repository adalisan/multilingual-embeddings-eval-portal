retail sales data due out this Wednesday are expected to help the U.S. Treasury market establish a fresh view of the strength of third-quarter growth and future Federal Reserve policy , market participants said . 
&quot; This number is important for both market psychology and to test what has been discounted &quot; as far as monetary policy , said Steven Ricchiuto , chief economist at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp. 
less than two weeks ago &quot; the market said the Fed is on hold forever and they were never going to tighten again . 
this ( data ) will determine how much tightening it put back in , &quot; he added . 
economists noted a shift in sentiment away from the rosy scenario popular until the beginning of August . 
market players had long believed the economy could continue to grow strongly without boosting inflation . 
but the various purchasing managers &apos; reports , which showed solid economic growth and higher prices , and the strong July employment data changed that view . 
now , rather than expecting the Fed to stay on hold , and possibly even ease credit next year , the market has started to talk about a tightening as early as September . 
&quot; This is a pivotal number to analyze psychology , &quot; said Ricchiuto . 
overall sales in July are expected to have risen 0.7 percent , with sales excluding autos seen up 0.4 percent , according to a Reuters poll of economists . 
but in the wake of strong auto and chain-store sales figures , some analysts are looking for stronger numbers . 
Brian Jones , economist at Salomon Brothers , predicts a 1.1-percent overall retail sales gain and a 0.5-percent rise in the core rate along with upward revisions to June data . 
even so , he said , &quot; retail sales may understate consumer spending , &quot; since the series incorporates spending on goods , but not on services . 
goods spending comprises only 40 percent of the total , leaving the remaining 60 percent spending on services unaccounted for until the end of the month , when personal spending expenditures data are released . 
in addition to auto and department store spending , sales at drug stores , gas stations and on building materials and furniture are expected to have boosted retail sales in July , economists said . 
although bond yields already reflect expectations of a strong set of numbers , Treasury prices could fall further if the market &apos;s fears are realized . 
&quot; We &apos;re going through a worry phase where strong growth begets fears of higher inflation , &quot; said Mitchell held , chief economist at Smith Barney Inc .
