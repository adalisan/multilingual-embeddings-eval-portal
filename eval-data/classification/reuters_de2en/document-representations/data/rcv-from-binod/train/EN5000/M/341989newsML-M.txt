U.S. West Coast light crudes were little changed on Tuesday in line with a flat West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) market and no trades for Alaskan North Slope ( crude ) , traders said . 
with no new ANS deals reported Tuesday , and diffs flat at $ 1.45 under March WTI , outright prices rose a slight five cents to $ 22.35 / 22.55 a barrel . 
traders said heavy California grades were flat Tuesday but saw near-term weakeness amid talk Tuesday that Tosco cancelled deliveries of three crude contracts to its Martinez , Calif . , refinery . 
the company throttled back production at the facility last week after a fire shut its hydrotreater . 
Tosco declared force majeure on roughly 40,000 barrels-per-day , a trader said . 
that left extra crude in a market amply supplied by planned shutdowns at Mobil and Chevron . 
California oil companies offered heavy oil at an average price of $ 18 Tuesday , or $ 1.50 less a barrel than three weeks ago . 
traders reported cargoes sold at 50 to 25 cents under those averages and expected further declines . 
outright prices for Kern River , a representative heavy grade , were offered at $ 17.75 and bid about $ 17.50 .
