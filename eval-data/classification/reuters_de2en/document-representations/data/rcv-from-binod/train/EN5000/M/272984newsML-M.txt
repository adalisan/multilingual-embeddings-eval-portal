Brazilian stocks ended down in weak trade amid profit-taking ahead of Christmas and concerns about President Fernando Henrique Cardoso &apos;s bid to stand for re-election in 1998 , brokers said . 
&quot; It may not be as sure a thing as many had believed , &quot; one dealer said , adding some local players also took profits ahead of the two-day Bolsa holiday . 
the Sao Paulo bourse &apos;s Bovespa index of 49 most- traded shares slipped 0.43 percent to close at 69,126 points on slow turnover of 200 million reais ( $ 192.3 million ) . 
brokers said the market saw a mild technical correction due to the weak volume , led by Telebras , after Friday &apos;s rise . 
they said prices also fell on concerns Cardoso may not yet have the votes sewn up to approve a re-election bill . 
an official said Monday the government now expects Congress &apos; lower house to vote on the bill on January 13 , rather than January 8 as originally forecast , to allow the PMDB party to hold a one-day convention on the issue the day before . 
among blue chips , benchmark Telebras preferred fell 1.0 percent to end at 79.00 reais . 
Telebras voting common closed flat at 73 reais while Telesp preferred closed off 1.97 percent to end at 565.50 reais after rising strongly last week . 
other leaders ended mixed . 
State miner CIA Vale do Rio Doce closed up 1.24 percent at 20.35 reais and state oil monopoly Petrobras ended 0.32 percent higher at 159 reais . 
but state power holding Eletrobras ended off 0.27 percent to close at 370 reais . 
the dip in Eletrobras preferred followed the general trend among power shares as the Bolsa &apos;s Electrical Energy Index of nine most liquid power shares slipped 0.87 percent to end at 1,853 points . 
meanwhile , state-owned Banco do Brasil &apos;s preferred share rose 2.86 percent to end at nine reais after the bank released figures showing it posted a 25.9 million-real net profit in November .
