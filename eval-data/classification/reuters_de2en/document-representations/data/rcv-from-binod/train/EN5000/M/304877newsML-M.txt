CSCE March coffee futures jumped to its highest level in eight months Tuesday on speculative and commission house buying amid concerns about dwindling near-term supplies , traders said . 
&quot; Overall stocks are low , &quot; said Refco Inc analyst Ann Predergast . 
&quot; CSCE stocks are low , consumer stocks are low and producer stocks are low . 
Most-active March delivery rose 3.75 cents per lb on the day , to close at 122.20 cents , its highest settlement since May 17 , after ranging from 122.50 to 119.25 . 
Second-position May ended 2.45 cents higher , at 118.85 cents , while the outer months finished up 0.65 to 2.05 cents . 
the March / May switch , a barometer of nearby availability , widened to 3.35 cents , up from 2.05 cents at the close Monday . 
supply jitters were fueled by the latest decline in certified coffee stocks , traders said . 
the CSCE reported after Monday &apos;s close certified coffee stocks in U.S. warehouses fell by 9,070 60-kg bags in the week ended January 10 , to 23,388 bags . 
no bags were pending grading or recertification . 
after Tuesday &apos;s close , the CSCE , which will now update its certified stock data daily instead of weekly , reported stocks fell by 250 bags as of Jan . 13 , to 23,138 bags . 
traders await the Green Coffee Association of New York &apos;s monthly stock report for December to get a broader picture of the supply situation . 
most traders expected the data , slated for release after Wednesday &apos;s close , to show an increase of some 50,000 to 100,000 bags on the month , although some traders forecasted a decline of up to 150,000 bags . 
after breaching near-term resistance at 121.50 cents today , traders pegged March &apos;s next upside target at 124.00-125.00 cents . 
support was seen around 120.00 . 
volume was fairly heavy at an estimated 11,875 lots , up from Monday &apos;s official tally of 8,481 lots .
