South Korea on Monday dismissed North Korea &apos;s explanation for the infiltration of a submarine last week as &quot; not worthy of consideration &quot; . 
a defence ministry spokesman told a news conference that Pyongyang was simply trying to defuse criticism by saying the vessel had drifted into Southern waters as a result of engine failure . 
the North Korean explanation came in a statement carried by its official Korea Central News Agency . 
Pyongyang also demanded the return of the submarine and its crew , including the bodies of those killed . 
&quot; The North Korean explanation about the ship is nonsense . 
it is not worthy of consideration , &quot; the South Koran spokesman said . 
&quot; It is nothing but North Korea &apos;s habitual , deceitful policy aimed at defusing criticism . 
&quot; The intrusion was a carefully planned infiltration , &quot; the spokesman added . 
South Korean authorities believe 26 North Koreans came ashore from the submarine on Wednesday . 
twenty have been shot and killed and one captured alive .
