Guatemalan officials launched a probe on Thursday into the cause of a plane crash that killed five people , including a top official from U.S. telecommunications company GTE Corp. 
civil aviation officials said they had no immediate theories on why the Westwind 24 corporate jet slammed into the side of a mountain just outside Guatemala City early on Wednesday , killing GTE senior executive Bruce Haddad , his wife and three Venezuelan crew members . 
&quot; We are investigating , but it will take time . 
we can &apos;t put forward any theories because we have to get to the bottom of it , &quot; German Bran , a Guatemalan civil aviation official , told Reuters . 
officials said late on Wednesday , however , that the plane may have drifted off course shortly before it crashed near the Pacaya Volcano , some 15 miles ( 25 km ) west of the capital . 
&quot; It was good weather , 9 kilometres ( 5.6 miles ) visibility . 
the tower told the pilot -- and it &apos;s on tape -- a few seconds before the accident that he was off course , &quot; Ronald Peter Zineri , Guatemala &apos;s director of civil aviation said . 
officials said they did not know if parts of the airplane , which was scattered widely across a steep and heavily wooded mountain , would be removed from the crash site for analysis . 
the bodies of Haddad , an American who lived in Irving , Texas , his wife and the crew members were brought to Guatemala City on Thursday while authorities made funeral arrangements with family members . 
&quot; All five bodies will be returned to their countries of origin , &quot; Augusto Lopez of funeral home Funerales Reforma told Reuters . 
he added that the Haddads would be cremated as per requests by family members . 
the plane had taken off from Caracas , Venezuela , picked up the Haddads in Lima , Peru , and was to make a stop in Guatemala City on its way to Dallas , Texas .
