Britain on Wednesday unveiled plans for some of the strictest gun laws in the world , banning the majority of handguns in response to the Dunblane massacre when a loner shot dead 16 young children and their teacher . 
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth told parliament the government would present legislation that would ban at least 80 percent of Britain &apos;s 200,000 legally held handguns . 
the only handguns Britons would be allowed are single-shot .22-inch calibre weapons , widely used in shooting competitions . 
they would have to be held under lock and key at gun clubs , which would have to meet stringent new security standards . 
Interior minister Michael Howard said the new regulations could become law before Christmas if other parties cooperated . 
&quot; The country expects nothing less , &quot; Howard said . 
Forsyth , whose own parliamentary constituency includes Dunblane , was presenting the findings of an inquiry into the massacre carried out by a senior judge , Lord Douglas Cullen . 
&quot; Members of the House ( of Commons ) will want to study the report for themselves , but I conclude that this was an act of calculated wickedness , &quot; Forsyth told a sombre chamber . 
Cullen had recommended more modest curbs , including a requirement to keep handguns at gun clubs and not at home . 
but Major , with a majority of just two in the 651-seat lower chamber of parliament , was advised that he risked defeat in parliament unless he went much further . 
a petition organised by Dunblane parents for a total ban on handguns has collected 750,000 signatures and helped persuade the main opposition Labour party to back complete prohibition . 
the Labour Party signalled that Major could still face a tough fight to win approval for the proposals . 
labour &apos;s Scottish affairs spokesman , George Robertson , praised the government for listening to the force of public opinion but urged it to &quot; take that final but fundamental step towards the eradication of handguns in our country &quot; . 
Robertson , whose children attend the school where the massacre occurred in March , said : &quot; There is no place in any decent , civilised society for handguns of any kind . 
&quot; Let us therefore resolve that the lasting legacy of the evil which visited Dunblane on March 13 will be the complete outlawing of handguns . 
police welcomed the announcement . 
&quot; The gun lobby for too long have enjoyed the privilege of their &quot; sport &apos; whilst ignoring the vast majority of people &apos;s abhorrence of the sheer firepower of modern weapons , &quot; the Police Superintendents &apos; Association said . 
Dunblane has become synonymous with senseless violence since Thomas Hamilton , a loner with a worrying fondness for young boys , walked into the town &apos;s primary school in March and coldly began a slaughter of the innocents that shocked the world . 
he then turned one of his four semi-automatic pistols on himself . 
Hamilton held gun certificates from the police and was a member of a gun club . 
the Scottish police inspector who granted Hamilton a gun licence has resigned , Forsyth said . 
gun lobbyists argue that most of the 57,000 holders of handgun licences practise target shooting and other legal activities and should not have to pay for the actions of one deranged gunman . 
it was the second time within months that a developed country has cracked down on firearms following a mass slaughter . 
in July , Australian Prime Minister John Howard won national agreement to laws banning self-loading guns and tightening firearm ownership rules after 35 people were shot dead at the Port Arthur tourist site on the island of Tasmania on April 28 . 
Forsyth announced a raft of complementary measures including improved security at schools and closer vetting and supervising of adults working with children and young people . 
home Secretary Michael Howard also unveiled steps to make it harder for individuals and gun clubs to obtain licences . 
in addition he proposed a ban on mail-order purchases of firearms and the sale of expanding ammunition of the type Hamilton used .
