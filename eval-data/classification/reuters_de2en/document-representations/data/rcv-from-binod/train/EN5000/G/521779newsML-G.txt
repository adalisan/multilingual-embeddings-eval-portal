the German government on Friday presented multimedia legislation to parliament , hailing it as a pioneering effort to tame the wild electronic frontier of the Internet . 
the parliamentary debate , which kicked off the final leg of a process expected to lead to the passage of the Information and Communications Services Bill , opens in a week overshadowed by the surprise indictment of online service CompuServe in Bavaria . 
defending the government &apos;s efforts to &quot; protect the weakest &quot; in society with tough laws to fight illegal misuse of the Internet , Research and Technology Minister Juergen Ruettgers said the problem should not be exaggerated . 
&quot; The Internet must not become a legal vacuum . 
this country is not prepared to tolerate certain things that appear there , &quot; he said . 
Germany has acted to stop neo-Nazi electronic magazines on the World Wide Web , usually located abroad but viewable by Germans over the Internet , from distributing diatribes which deny the Nazis killed Jews in concentration camp gas chambers -- the so-called &quot; Auschwitz Lie &quot; , which is illegal here . 
&quot; We must continue to forbid the Auschwitz lie , regardless of whether it is spread in black and white or in bit and byte , &quot; Ruettgers told the sparsely-attended debate . 
Bonn has stepped up efforts to fight pornographic images , easily viewable by children on Web sites around the world . 
certain hard-core images are illegal in Germany . 
Bavarian prosecutors earlier this week indicted Felix Somm , the head of CompuServe &apos;s German operation , on charges of aiding the exchange of child porn and extremist propaganda via its online service . 
Ruettgers said , however , that the issue of Internet smut should not be blown out of proportion . 
&quot; We are talking here about just one percent of the total content available on the Internet , so I don &apos;t want discussion of these things to get the upper hand . 
but it is still important that we have some rules and guidelines , &quot; he said . 
while the new law would set standards for child protection in cyberspace , it mainly seeks to define which activities require regulation and which can be operated without any formal licence or regulatory oversight . 
to do this it distiguishes between traditional media forms that use the Internet and should therefore fall under media regulations and new services such as electronic mail that the government says should not be classified as media . 
speaking for the opposition Social Democrats ( SPD ) , deputy chairman Wolfgang Thierse said trying to censor the Internet would fail , but he called for the police to set up a national coordination centre to monitor illegal online activities . 
in addition Ruettgers , who has been dubbed Germany &apos;s &quot; Future Minister &quot; , took issue with the frequent analysis that Germany was falling behind its Western partners in the race into cyberspace . 
Germany spends less than the United States or Japan per capita on educating students about multimedia and there are far fewer personal computers in homes and offices . 
Ruettgers said the situation was improving . 
online connections rose 40 percent last year to 2.3 million and German companies were stepping up efforts to adapt new technology . 
&quot; It is important that this law has come , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We are the first country in the world that has launched an effort to clearly define the legal framework ( for multimedia services ) . 
the SPD , while generally in favour of the legislation , said the government was far too optimistic in its assessment of Germany &apos;s competitive position in the new digital economy . 
Thierse said the bill ignored the convergence of traditional media and television and computing . 
it would have been better to expand existing media laws than to create a new legal framework that has no teeth . 
&quot; Who can tell the difference between communications services and media in an age where technological developments are all leading towards the television . 
Microsoft is already moving in this direction in the United States , &quot; he said .
