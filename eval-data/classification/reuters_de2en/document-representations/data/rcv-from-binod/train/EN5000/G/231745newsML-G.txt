Spanish police have uncovered a base used by ETA Basque separatist guerrillas in central Madrid , Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said on Tuesday . 
he told journalists that the &quot; safe house &quot; , situated in a busy commercial district of central Madrid , had been stuffed with arms and attack plans and has been a base for ETA &apos;s Madrid command . 
anti-terrorist police said the apartment contained automatic rifles , submachine guns , cases of bombs , grenades and various explosives together with plans for future armed operations . 
ETA ( Basque Homeland and Freedom ) has been fighting the central Spanish authorities for Basque independence since 1968 . 
some 800 people have been killed in the conflict so far . 
police said the base had apparently been in use until April and that noone had been arrested in the operation . 
police said they had found plenty of fingerprints in the apartment that could help them identify the members of the Madrid command . 
police said Rufino Arriaga , believed responsible for a car bomb attack in May that killed an army sergeant in Cordoba , had rented the apartment , along with two others . 
they said the command was also behind the February shooting death of Francisco Tomas y Valiente , a well-known retired judge . 
the apartment is in a building full of frequently changing tenants , making it easier to maintain anonymity , police said . 
the last such base was found in Madrid in 1992 .
