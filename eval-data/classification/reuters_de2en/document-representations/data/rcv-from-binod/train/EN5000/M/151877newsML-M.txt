Shenzhen &apos;s B share index rose on Tuesday on demand for Shenzhen-based counters and the A share index fell slightly in record turnover , brokers said . 
brokers said the rise was due in part to speculative buying of Shenzhen-based shares , such as Shenbao , which surged HK $ 0.62 , or 29.81 percent , to HK $ 2.70 on a single trade of 100 shares , brokers said . 
the issue will definitely fall back in future sessions and in turn pull down the index , they added . 
Chiwan Petroleum was the second best performer on speculative buying , brokers said . 
the counter is due to go ex-rights on October 30 , the Shenzhen bourse has said . 
brokers said the counter &apos;s recent steady advance was due to investor confidence in the firm &apos;s results this year . 
demand for Shenzhen-based property from Hong Kong should pick up after mid-1997 when the territory is handed back to China , which would benefit the company , analysts said . 
Hainan Pearl River , the sharpest loser , dropped HK $ 0.05 or 2.50 percent to HK $ 1.95 , on trade of 23,700 shares , in speculative selling , brokers said .

the composite index edged up 0.02 points , or 0.01 percent , to finish at 363.89 .

Shenzhen Development Bank surged 1.19 yuan , or 7.14 percent , to 17.85 yuan on massive trade of 88.49 million shares .
