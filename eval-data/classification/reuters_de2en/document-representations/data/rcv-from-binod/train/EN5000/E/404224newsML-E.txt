a leading Mexican business group on Tuesday said new credit was vital for Mexico to achieve its goal of 4.5 percent economic growth in 1997 . 
&quot; This year we have the enormous responsibility of substantially improving credit , because if not how are we going to generate 4.5 percent GDP ( growth ) ? 
&quot; , said Carlos Gutierrez , head of the National Manufacturing Industry Chamber . 
he said many companies , still struggling to recover from the 1994-1995 peso crisis , needed liquidity to get projects off the ground . 
he said the chamber , known as Canacintra , was advising its members on how to apply for credit and on providing loan guarantees to speed up the flow of funds .
