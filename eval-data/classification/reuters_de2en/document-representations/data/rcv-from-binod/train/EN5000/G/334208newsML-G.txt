Britain on Monday told the Irish Republican Army it would be hunted down remorselessly unless it ended its campaign of violence . 
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said the IRA , which has unleashed a fresh round of bomb attacks in its efforts to end British rule in the province , could not bully its way to the conference table . 
&quot; We will pursue you with every means open to us under the law , &quot; he said in a speech . 
&quot; We shall never give up . 
we shall go to any expense . 
you will never be safe . 
in a message to Gerry Adams , president of the IRA &apos;s political wing Sinn Fein , Mayhew said : &quot; In this democracy you cannot bully your way to the negotiating table . 
&quot; You must show us all that you are content to rely , like the rest of us , on the ballot , and that you will never again supplement it by the bullet . 
then you will be welcome to take your seat . 
Britain said earlier it was not seeking the expulsion of Protestant Loyalist political parties from multi-party peace talks despite sectarian attacks blamed by police on Loyalist extremists . 
Northern Ireland Office junior minister Michael Ancram told reporters before round-table talks he did not believe politicians linked to the banned Protestant extremists had breached peace principles which are a condition of seats at the talks . 
Sinn Fein , a bitter foe of the pro-British Loyalist guerrillas , accused Britain of &quot; practising double standards &quot; by barring it while keeping Loyalists at the table . 
Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said in a statement that the Irish government and chief Catholic nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party &quot; should now be arguing for immediate entry for Sinn Fein into the talks &quot; . 
the Loyalist parties , the political wings of outlawed extremist groups , want Northern Ireland to remain British . 
Sinn Fein has been barred from the talks until the Irish Republican Army , which is fighting for the province to be united with Ireland , reinstates a truce it ended last year with bombs on the British mainland . 
Ancram stressed there could be no double standards and that Britain would continue to evaluate the position . 
after a bomb attack on a Catholic family last week , Britain issued a stiff warning to Loyalist parties that representations might be made to have them thrown them out of talks if it was felt that they had breached peace principles . 
Ancram said on Monday : &quot; The evaluation we have made is not going to lead us to make a formal representation . 
police chiefs blame Loyalist guerrillas for what they regard as revenge attacks after a surge in hostilities by the IRA . 
but they have not publicly linked the incidents to the politicians &apos; allies in the Combined Loyalist Military Command ( CLMC ) , which declared a ceasefire in October 1994 . 
Loyalist politicians who say they want to see all violence ended insist that the CLMC is still holding to a ceasefire .
