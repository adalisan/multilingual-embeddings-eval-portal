Italian government bond ( BTP ) futures on Monday looked vulnerable to a considerable slide after the lira rejoined Europe &apos;s Exchange Rate Mechanism ( ERM ) on Sunday , technical analysts said . 
Chartists said the market , which reached a new contract record at 128.70 on Monday , was becoming frothy and unlikely to sustain much longer the bull run that has gripped it since August . 
&quot; The market is extremely volatile in this current environment , &quot; said Tom Hobson at Merrill Lynch in London . 
after hitting the new high , BTPs went into reverse on reports that Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi could face trial on charges of abuse of power while he was head of the state holding company IRI . 
December BTP futures were 0.17 percentage points lower on the day at 127.75 . 
Chartists said the BTPs could make renewed moves towards fresh highs , but investors should be cautious . 
&quot; We &apos;re on &quot; reversal watch &apos; with this market at the moment , &quot; said David Sneddon , technical analyst at Credit Suisse in London . 
Sneddon said signs late last week that the direction of the lira and the BTP contract were diverging were a clear warning . 
&quot; Mark / lira has declined , and the BTP has come up but not really penetrated very much , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Looking at the BTP on a long-term charts , it really looks as if this is quite an unsustainable move . 
December BTPs have staged a sharp rally since August , putting on several major spurts . 
Chartists said the speed of the move undermined its strength , and suggested that any technical break lower would spark a sharp decline in BTP prices . 
analysts said one key point for a possible break lower was the 128.50 to 127.56 area . 
&quot; If we came back below the 127.55 hourly pivot region , that would certainly suggest an immediate loss of upside momentum , &quot; said Sneddon . 
&quot; Then the market could come back and challenge its recent lows . 
technical analysts pointed to 126.62 , the low plotted on daily charts on November 22 , as further support , but said the risk of further sharp declines was looming . 
Charles Diebel , senior fixed income analyst at Technical Data , said things looked dangerous for BTPs below 127.56 . 
&quot; Below 127.56 , there is really not very much in the way of support until we get to the 125.00 area , &quot; said Diebel . 
&quot; And that is a long way down . 
while chartists said the chance of a limited upside move was still there for BTPs , investors should tread very carefully . 
&quot; If the market continues to rally quickly , we may take some profits 20 to 30 basis points higher than we are now , &quot; Hobson , Merrill &apos;s director of technical analysis , told Reuters Financial Television . 
credit Suisse &apos;s Sneddon agreed . 
&quot; The greatest luxury would be not to have to be in this market at all , &quot; he said .
