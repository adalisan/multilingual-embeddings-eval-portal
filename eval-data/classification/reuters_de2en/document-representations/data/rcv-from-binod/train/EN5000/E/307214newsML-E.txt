retail sales growth in Britain continued to slow in December as the month got off to a poor start and only picked up pace a few days before Christmas , the British Retail Consortium ( BRC ) said on Tuesday . 
like-for-like sales grew 4.3 percent year-on-year in value in December , the slowest rate since April . 
the BRC said growth was in line with that recorded last December but down from the 4.9 percent rate seen in November and 5.9 percent in October . 
&quot; This Christmas was a nail biting time for retailers , with a last minute surge creating a reasonable December for most retailers , &quot; said Andrew Higginson , chairman of the BRC Economic Affairs Committee . 
&quot; There is no evidence of a boom and the retail market remains highly competitive keeping price increases in check . 
on the basis of these figures , there appears to be no justification for an increase in interest rates . 
the underlying rate of increase in the value of retail sales also fell back , to 5.0 percent in the three months to December , versus 5.8 percent in the previous three months to September . 
&quot; A very poor start to December came right in the last few days before Christmas , &quot; the BRC said , adding that the late pick-up in sales was followed by an encouraging start to the January sales period , when high street retailers traditionally slash prices . 
it added there was a good performance in electrical and DIY sectors but some disappointment in others such as food and drink , clothing , footwear , furniture and carpets . 
&quot; The poor performance experienced ( in footwear ) in November persisted through December with disappointing overall results despite widespread &quot; sale &apos; activity prior to Christmas , &quot; it said . 
Andrew Sentance , chief economic advisor to the BRC said the figures confirmed the current consumer recovery was very different from that in the late 1980s . 
&quot; Lower value growth may partly reflect lower inflation in the retail sector -- particularly in terms of food prices - which will help to offset the upward pressure on the RPI from higher petrol prices , &quot; he said . 
&quot; concerns that an inflationary consumer boom is emerging seem well wide of the mark .
