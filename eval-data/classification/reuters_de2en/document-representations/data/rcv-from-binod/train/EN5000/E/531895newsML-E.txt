the New Zealand government said on Thursday it posted a NZ $ 3.104 billion operating budget surplus for the nine months to March 31 , 1997 , against a forecast surplus of $ 3.049 billion . 
net public debt as a percentage of GDP was 26.9 percent at March 31 against a forecast 27.3 percent , and compared with 31.5 percent at June 30 , 1996 . 
Treasury said several factors were responsible for the improvement in the operating result . 
non-tax revenue was $ 104 million or 4.6 percent above forecast , largely due to higher than expected dividend income and gains on marketable securities and deposits . 
expenses , excluding net foreign exchange gains , were $ 182 million or 0.7 percent lower than forecast . 
in addition , the net surplus ( less distributions ) attributable to State-owned enterprises and government entities was $ 66 million ( 39.8 percent ) greater than forecast . 
partly offsetting these favourable variances was taxation revenue that was $ 275 million ( 1.1 percent ) lower than forecast . 
Treasury said the year-to-date favourable variance in the operating balance had fallen by $ 110 million in the month of March , due primarily to indirect tax revenue falling by $ 161 million against forecast . 
this was largely due to timing differences in goods and services tax revenue reversing . 
improvements against forecast for the month in expenses of $ 43 million partly offset the lower than forecast indirect tax revenue . 
the government &apos;s net worth stood at $ 6.682 billion against a forecast $ 6.599 billion and against $ 3.344 billion at June 30 , 1996 . 
the improvement in the net worth was mainly due to the higher than forecast operating surplus of $ 3.104 billion and net asset revaluations of $ 234 million . 
net public debt was $ 24.963 billion , $ 306 million ( 1.2 percent ) lower than forecast , and $ 3.674 billion ( 12.8 percent ) lower than at June 30 . 
this was principally due to lower than forecast net purchases of physical assets ( $ 322 million ) , largely due to timing differences in the purchase of specialist military equipment and delays in the building of new school sites . 
Treasury said the significant reduction in net public debt since June 30 was principally due to proceeds from the sale of Forestry Corporation of New Zealand and the net cash inflows from operations over the past nine months . 
net cash flows from operating and investing activities were $ 4.93 billion , compared with a forecast inflow of $ 4.834 billion . 
the $ 3.104 billion operating surplus in the nine months to March 1997 compares to surpluses of $ 3.491 billion and $ 4.269 billion in the nine months to March 1995 and March 1996 respectively .
