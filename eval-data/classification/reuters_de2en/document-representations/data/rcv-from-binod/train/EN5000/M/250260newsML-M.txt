tight supplies will affect U.S. distillate prices through this winter despite an increase in stocks , U.S. Energy Information Administration Chief Jay Hakes said Wednesday . 
speaking to an energy group , Hakes said the supply situation for heating oil is still &quot; very , very serious , but moving in the right direction . 
&quot; Hakes noted weekly EIA figures released earlier showed distillate stocks were 10 percent below last year &apos;s level as opposed to 16 percent below the previous week . 
Hakes said a more serious tight supply-demand situation , at least in the short term , has developed in the propane market , where he said prices likely will remain volatile through the winter . 
the EIA chief also said there was growing concern about supplies of natural gas as stocks were 10 percent below last year &apos;s level and volatility was increasing in the spot markets . 
&quot; You can expect volatility for gas as well during the winter , &quot; Hakes said . 
he said gas stocks have been moving &quot; in a negative direction , &quot; adding , &quot; I think this obviously will put more pressure on gas in the next few weeks . 
gasoline stocks are one percent below last year , but he said supplies could become a concern later if refineries continue to focus on distillate production .
