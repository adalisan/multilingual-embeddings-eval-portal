the dollar soared over a pfennig in early trade on Thursday , boosted by by its safe-haven status after Germany &apos;s central bank renounced government plans to revalue its gold assets . 
in equities , Paris stocks bounced back as investors went bargain hunting after the bourse was hammered on Wednesday by fears that the left may be well placed in Sunday &apos;s runoff parliamentary elections . 
Elswhere , London made an unsteady start . 
most of the excitement was in currency markets where the dollar got off to a good start because of the rift between Bonn and its Bundesbank central bank . 
&quot; If you are talking about safe-haven currencies , then sterling and the dollar spring to mind , &quot; said Stuart Frost , analyst at NatWest Markets . 
the Bundesbank &apos;s harsh attack on the government , which aimed to revalue gold and currency reserves to give a much-needed cash injection to public finances , sent jitters through the market in the run-up to European Monetary Union . 
the dollar surged to 1.7055 against the mark in early transactions , compared to 1.6902 in late European trade on Wednesday . 
the U.S. curency was also stronger against the yen . 
the public row in Germany has added spice to EMU uncertainty as it follows the unexpectedly strong showing for the French Socialists in weekend elections . 
market expectations are that if the Socialists are elected during the final run-off this weekend , they will push for Italy and Spain to be included among EMU &apos;s founding members -- watering down the euro from the start . 
&quot; The dollar should be favoured against the deutschmark because of the French elections and because the gold-revaluation rift has given a blow to Germany &apos;s reputation , &quot; said Claudio Demolli , foreign exchange strategist at Merrill Lynch . 
analysts also said the gold revaluation plan , which would help Germany cut back its deficits to make the grade for EMU , would also make it more difficult for Germany to reject countries such as Spain and Italy in the first round . 
against the yen , the dollar got a boost from an unexpected fall in Japan &apos;s April industrial production , which dampened expectations of higher Japanese rates . 
in equity markets , Paris soared by over one percent after closing down 3.63 percent , its second big drop of the week on the enhanced prospects for the left in elections on Sunday . 
dealers said the boost came from bottom-fishing after the week &apos;s sharp falls . 
&quot; This is a market of excesses , &quot; one trader said . 
&quot; There have been sharp changes that didn &apos;t mean very much . 
but dealers said that despite Thursday &apos;s rebound , many investors were remaining cautious because of the market &apos;s instability in recent sessions . 
the market was again influenced by election result rumours , this time by talk a poll by the Swiss newspaper La Tribune de Geneve set for release Thursday evening on the internet would show the right well placed ahead of Sunday &apos;s runoff . 
in London , stocks recovered after making a negative start , hit by the new uncertainty over EMU and overnight losses on the Wall Street . 
they were trading in the plus column by mid-morning . 
&quot; The market is around its highs and when you get wobbles like these around Europe , the market &apos;s not too happy , &quot; said BZW strategist , Steve Wright . 
sterling strengthened against the mark , a factor which has squeezed profits warnings out of UK industry recently and driven share prices down . 
&quot; Sterling is back up at 2.79 ( against the mark ) and that &apos;s not going to help , &quot; said a dealer . 
in Frankfurt , floor trade was closed because of a public holiday . 
dealings on the electronic IBIS index were mixed in thin volumes and there was little initial reaction to Bundesbank clash with Bonn . 
bourse trade resumes on Friday . 
the dollar was quoted at 1.7050 marks and 116.40 yen compared with 1.6902 marks and 115.86 yen in late European trading on Tuesday .
