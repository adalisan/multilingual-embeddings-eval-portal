cash cocoa trade in Europe has perked up , with sellers offering some extremely cheap beans into the market early in the week and chocolate makers taking advantage of a slide in terminal prices later on . 
trade sources said on Friday there had been some good selling of the 1997 / 98 main Ivorian crop when the market was a little higher early in the week . 
they noted both broker-to-industry business and outright shipper selling . 
&quot; There was some belated selling of the main crop when the market was a bit steadier -- some of it at ridiculous prices , &quot; one trade source said . 
Abidjan shippers were cited as offering beans for March delivery at up to 30 stg under the London terminal . 
in other cases there was trade-to-industry business at around 20 stg under for positions from January next year through to March . 
&quot; The 30 stg under deals sound very cheap but these were no doubt shippers selling outright at franc prices equivalent to that sterling value , &quot; another added . 
in other business , one trade source cited a 1,000-tonne U.S. deal done from Europe for spot Ivory at $ 170 over the New York terminal market . 
London-traded cocoa futures began the week around the 1,030 stg mark , basis the July position . 
by Friday , July had dipped below 1,000 to hit a morning low of 992 stg . 
&quot; There has been some good speculative selling this week but also industry offtake around to pick it up . 
I think the market has probably found a bottom , &quot; one trader commented . 
European demand has not been restricted to beans , with sources also reporting large quantities of butter sold to Swiss and German chocolate manufacturers . 
deals were reportedly done for the third and fourth quarter of this year at ratios of 2.40 and 2.43 times September and December respectively . 
traders said the prices were not impossible but sounded on the cheap side . 
some put the butter market nearer to 2.45 . 
others also reported Swiss and German interest in Ivory and Nigerian beans for 1998 and 1999 . 
interest nearby remains slack . 
major U.S. trade house Phibro continues to be a talking point , with traders citing it as one of the major buyers on the London terminal market on Thursday . 
its worldwide cocoa stockpile , believed to be up to 500,000 tonnes was originally hedged on March and May positions , but has now has been moved forward to December and beyond , traders said . 
however , there still seems to be little worry on behalf of industry of a potential squeeze occurring , at least near-term . 
&quot; No one is showing the slightest interest in anything until December . 
I thought they ( Phibro ) may have been in a position to give the market a bit of a squeeze at one point -- now I &apos;m not so sure , &quot; one trader said .
