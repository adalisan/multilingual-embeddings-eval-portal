Damascus , Aug 6 ( Ruter ) - Peace in the Middle East was impossible as long as Israel proceeded with building Jewish settlements in land it occupied from Arabs in 1967 , Syrian newspapers said on Wednesday . 
the official newspapers also warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was pushing the region towards a &quot; grave explosion &quot; and urged Arabs to prepare for &quot; military and political &quot; battles with Israel . 
&quot; Netanyahu &apos;s government , under an already-set plan , is pushing the region to a grave explosion aiming at mixing cards and pulling the carpet from under the peace process , &quot; the ruling party newspaper al-Baath said . 
it accused Israel of planning to build new Jewish settlements in the West Bank , Jerusalem and the Golan Heights to &quot; create a status quo that would make it impossible to resume peace talks now or at any time in the future . 
&quot; In a few years and before the end of Netanyahu &apos;s rule there would be no Arab land that was not judaised so to cut the way short before any future concessions , &quot; it added . 
sporadic Syrian-Israeli peace talks hit a deadlock after Netanyahu said he would not hand back the strategic Golan in return for peace . 
Syria &apos;s key demand is full withdrawal from the Heights , captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War . 
the daily al-Thawra said the United States , as Israel &apos;s closest ally and main sponsor of the Middle East peace process launched in 1990 , was to blame for the crisis facing peacemaking . 
&quot; It is important to hear the U.S. view and its evaluation of the criminal practices by Israel and its attempts to drag the region to explosions and wars ... , &quot; it said . 
&quot; We are used to America &apos;s bias to Israel ... America is primarily responsible for Israel and its behaviours and for the current crisis in the peace process and for Israel &apos;s military fooling around in the region . 
Thawara said Arabs should mobilise and prepare for political , military , cultural , economic and all sorts of battles against Israel . 
&quot; The ( Arab ) confrontation should be as big as the looming Zionist expansionist danger which is targetting our land and existence , &quot; it said . 
Al-Baath added : &quot; As there is an absence of active and decisive international move and as it seems the U.S. has washed its hands of its role in the peace process , the region is reluctantly heading towards explosions that Israel and those who support it are responsible for .
