the Singapore dollar remained weak despite the release of strong trade data on Monday as market participants continued to focus on the city-state &apos;s competitiveness against a backdrop of regional currency turmoil . 
Singapore &apos;s non-oil domestic exports rose a nominal 8.8 percent year-on-year in June to Singapore $ 7.45 billion after falling 1.0 percent in May , the Trade Development Board ( TDB ) said . 
a Reuters poll of 12 economists last week had forecast a 6.3 percent nominal rise in non-oil exports . 
the Singapore dollar was quoted at 1.4657 / 67 to the U.S. dollar at 0810 GMT after falling to a low of 1.4670 . 
it had firmed in early trade as interbank interest rates spiked up on the back of tight money market liquidity . 
some dealers attributed the Singapore dollar &apos;s softness to reports which cited TDB comments on the Singapore dollar as meaning the government was watching the real , not the nominal exchange rate . 
the dealers interpreted these as indicating Singapore authorities would condone a weakening of the currency to keep exports competitive . 
the market latched onto the comments about the real exchange rate simply because of the need for export competitiveness , although traders pointed out that it was not the TDB which controlled exchange rate policy . 
&quot; There was this piece of news that the thing to note was the real exchange rate , not the nominal exchange rate . 
so the sing dollar needs to be weaker to be competitive against the rest of the Asian currencies , &quot; a U.S. bank dealer said . 
a TDB official said Singapore &apos;s trade growth was not likely to be affected by recent falls in Southeast Asian currencies because long-term fundamentals were what mattered . 
Chan Kam Fai , director of the TDB &apos;s trade policy division , told a news briefing Singapore &apos;s fundamentals looked good . 
&quot; What is important is not the nominal exchange rate but the real exchange rate because any change in the nominal exchange rate is eventually short term in nature in terms of export competitiveness , &quot; Chan said . 
the Singapore dollar has weakened by almost 2.5 percent against the U.S. dollar this month in line with sharp declines in Southeast Asian currencies following the de facto devaluation of the Thai baht and Philippine peso .
