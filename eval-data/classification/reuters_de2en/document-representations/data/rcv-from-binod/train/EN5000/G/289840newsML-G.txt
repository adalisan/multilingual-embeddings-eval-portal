President Suharto called on Monday for Indonesia &apos;s general elections in May to be a &quot; festivity of democracy &quot; without violence . 
Suharto , delivering his annual budget address to parliament , described the May general election as &quot; a festivity of democracy for use . 
normally as a festivity , the general election must bring happiness to all of us . 
&quot; A general election campaign that causes damage -- both physical and to people &apos;s property -- must be avoided , &quot; Suharto said in the address broadcast live on national television . 
&quot; The excesses of such a campaign will only disgrace the general election and tarnish the democratic practices that we want to uphold in this country , &quot; he said . 
Suharto said it was for this reason that the government had wanted to put the emphasis on a dialogue campaign by discussing development issues . 
last month it issued regulations banning street rallies in the official one month campaign period . 
he said it was unavoidable that the political climate would heat up ahead of the election . 
&quot; What we have to avoid is an uncontrolled situation , clashes and animosity among ourselves . 
this certainly is unhealthy and even endangers our nation , &quot; Suharto said , calling on people not to be antagonised by differences between each other . 
&quot; These kind of differences are the characteristics of democracy . 
therefore , we can overcome them through democratic means as well , &quot; Suharto said . 
four major riots have errupted in Indonesia in the last six months , two of them in the last two weeks . 
political and social analysts said this indicated how quickly ethnic and religious tensions could explode in this disparate nation of 200 million people . 
officials in briefings ahead of the budget speech said the government would boost spending on information at home and abroad by 56.2 percent to 286 billion rupiah ( $ 121 million ) . 
they said this covered increased political activity due to the elections and a general improvement in disseminating information through the archipelago of more than 13,500 islands . 
Monday &apos;s Jakarta Post newspaper quoted United Development Party ( PPP ) head Ismail Hasan Metareum as saying an unfair election could easily trigger riots given recent examples of public volatility . 
Metareum , head of the minority Moslem-orientated party , said at a party anniversary rally on Sunday that the public had become more sensitive to malfeasance , arrogance , hypocrisy and abuse of power . 
&quot; We urge central and regional authorities and security officers to take a lesson from this recent development within society , instead of inciting public resentment by violating fair play at the general election , &quot; he was quoted as saying . 
he added that one of the three official election contestants -- the ruling Golkar , PPP and the Christian-Nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party ( PDI ) -- was immature because it relied on the bureaucracy , who are all Golkar members , to win elections . 
Golkar , which has won the majority of the votes in the last five elections , is aiming to win 70 percent of the vote in the May 29 poll , two percent higher than its share at the 1992 election when the PPP receive 17 percent and the PDI 15 percent . 
the only three parties legally permitted to run will contest 425 seats in the 500-member parliament . 
the balance is allocated to the armed forces whose members do not formally vote .
