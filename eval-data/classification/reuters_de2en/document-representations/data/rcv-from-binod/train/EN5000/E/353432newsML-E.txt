Hungary &apos;s gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth is likely to accelerate this year , rising by three percent , after two years of almost flat performance , HSBC James Capel said in a country report , dated February 3 . 
&quot; We are looking for the Hungarian economy to bounce back from a period of sluggish growth in 1995 and 1996 and expand by a forecast three percent in 1997 , &quot; HSBC &apos;s emerging market strategist Nigel Rendell said in the report . 
according to preliminary figures Hungary &apos;s GDP increased by some 1.5 percent in 1995 and 0.5 percent in 1996 , he said . 
the government forecasts the GDP to grow by two to three percent in 1997 . 
economic growth will be increasingly underpinned by the domestic market as the year progresses and private consumption would also start to recover after being hit by two years of declining real income , HSBC said . 
investments were likely to be encouraged by the continuing decline of interest rates , Rendell said , adding that HSBC expected three-month interest rates to drop 200 basis points in 1997 from 21.5 percent in December 1996 and compared with 30.5 percent in December 1995 . 
HSBC also believes that Hungary &apos;s year-on-year inflation will go down to 17.4 percent by the last month of the year from 19.8 percent last December and 28.3 percent at the end of 1995 . 
Rendell said the general belief that the government was likely to favour some relaxation of the budget targets ahead of the 1998 elections appeared to be justified , but the extent of the slippage was likely to remain small . 
&quot; We expect some easing of the fiscal rein as the 1998 election approaches , but the extent of the loosening will be modest , &quot; the report said . 
HSBC projects that the general budget deficit will be maximum 5.5 percent of the GDP in 1997 , compared with the government &apos;s 4.9 percent target .
