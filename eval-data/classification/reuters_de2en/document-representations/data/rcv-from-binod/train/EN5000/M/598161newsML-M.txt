light sales early Tuesday mushroomed to brisk trading at $ 67.00 per cwt by midday in the U.S. Plains feedlot cattle market , feedlot sources said . 
the $ 67.00 level was steady with thin trade Monday and last Friday , but down $ 1.00 from last week &apos;s top price . 
about 50,000 head sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area and about 48,000 in Kansas , they said . 
daily totals will likely be larger once late sales were tallied , the feedlot sources said . 
Tuesday &apos;s sales ensure that feedlots and packers will be able to wind down going into the three-day holiday weekend . 
all major U.S. cattle slaughter and processing plants will be closed Monday , May 26 , in observance of Memorial Day , meat company sources said . 
brisk cattle trading so early in the week was also tied to packers &apos; desire to ensure adequate supplies of live cattle right after the holiday , the feedlot sources said . 
the holiday weekend unofficially starts the summer cookout season and is typically the hottest holiday beef demand period , market sources said .
