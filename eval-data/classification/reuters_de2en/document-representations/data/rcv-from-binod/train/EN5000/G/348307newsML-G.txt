Algeria &apos;s Armed Islamic Group ( GIA ) has posted warnings in the capital that more Algerian personalities will be killed , residents said on Friday . 
news of the threat surfaced one day after a retired general was killed and assassinated union leader Abdelhak Benhamouda , a staunch supporter of President Liamine Zeroual , was buried . 
&quot; The warnings are in tracts pasted on walls in Hussein Dey , &quot; one resident said by telephone . 
&quot; They are signed by the GIA and apparently were put up just a few days ago . 
they ( the GIA ) are threatening soon to attack all Algerian personalities , journalists , film-makers and senior executives . 
about 60 media employees have been killed since mid-1993 in attacks blamed by authorities on the rebels . 
journalists work under draconian laws on what they can report on security issues and are accused by Islamists of supporting the government . 
Hussein Dey , a working class suburb in the overcrowded capital Algiers , is a bastion of Moslem fundamentalists . 
one of Algeria &apos;s best known figures , UGTA union leader Benhamouda , was shot dead last Tuesday in the city &apos;s central May 1st Square . 
no-one has been arrested . 
the authorities blamed Moslem fundamentalists for gunning him down . 
his death , just weeks after he had announced he would form a political party , and the escape of the killers in the heavily -policed city , provoked a storm of questions in Algeria &apos;s independent newspapers as to who had really killed him , or ordered his elimination . 
Benhamouda was given a martyr &apos;s funeral on Thursday , attended by the president and senior government figures . 
shortly afterwards , Algerian security forces reported that a &quot; terrorist group &quot; -- Algeria &apos;s official term for Moslem fundamentalists -- had killed retired general Habib Khelil in the western Algerian city of Oran . 
security sources told Reuters they believed Khelil was in his 60s . 
they said he had been responsible for army logistics under late president Houari Boumedienne and ran the army recruitment service under former president Chadli Benjedid . 
about 60,000 people have been killed violently since the authorities in January 1992 cancelled a general election which Islamists were set to win . 
a new general election is promised in the first half of this year .
