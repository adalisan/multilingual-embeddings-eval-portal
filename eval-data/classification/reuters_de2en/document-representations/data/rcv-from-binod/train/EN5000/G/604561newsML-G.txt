France coach Aime Jacquet included a crop of strikers when he named his squad of 22 on Thursday for the World Cup warm-up Tournoi de France next month . 
Jacquet , whose main preoccupation since a sterile Euro 96 campaign in England last year has been a shortage of goals , picked recent regulars Patrice Loko and Christophe Dugarry and added Marc Keller of Karlsruhe , Lyon &apos;s Florian Maurice and Nicolas Ouedec who plays for Espanyol . 
to play in attack just behind the strikers in the June 3-11 tournament , Jacquet has chosen Internazionale &apos;s Youri Djorkaeff , Ibrahim Ba of Bordeaux and Metz winger Robert Pires . 
the tournament , with matches at the World Cup venues of Lyon , Nantes , Montpellier and Paris , includes world champions Brazil , Italy and England .
