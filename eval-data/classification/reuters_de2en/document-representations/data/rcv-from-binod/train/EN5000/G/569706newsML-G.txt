a London-based Kuwaiti and three Americans have been indicted for selling damaged parts scavenged from two aircraft destroyed by Iraqi troops in Kuwait during the Gulf War , prosecutors said on Thursday . 
the 25-count indictment unsealed in Chicago followed the arrest in Hawaii on Tuesday of Kuwaiti citizen Faleh Al-Rashidi , a parts dealer operating in London . 
the multi-billion-dollar used airplane parts market has come under increasing scrutiny because unscrupulous dealers reap huge profits from selling parts that should be scrapped . 
U.S. authorities have indicted 130 people in the past seven years for dealing in non-airworthy parts . 
in the current case , charred parts were scavenged from a British Airways Boeing 747 and a Kuwaiti McDonnell-Douglas DC-9 destroyed by occupying Iraqi troops on Kuwait City &apos;s airport tarmac in 1991 . 
with the aid of two conspirators who have not been charged , the four men allegedly falsified insurance and airline documents to obscure the origin of the parts and sold them to brokers . 
&quot; These parts were sold to at least 10 customers ; brokers who in turn sell parts to airlines both in the United States and other countries , &quot; U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois Jim Burns said . 
burns said federal authorities were satisfied that airlines that obtained the roughly $ 500,000 worth of faulty bolts , fan blades and other parts scavenged from Kuwait had replaced them . 
Federal authorities also seized three truckloads of parts -- representing 90 percent of the parts smuggled into the United States from the two planes in Kuwait -- at the now-defunct Navaero Aviation Corp. in the Chicago suburb of Alsip . 
also indicted on multiple fraud counts were Navaero &apos;s former chief executive officer Robert Mansfield , along with salesmen Dennis McCormick and David Dohm . 
all three were expected to turn themselves in for arraignment , and Rashidi was to be transported to Chicago .
