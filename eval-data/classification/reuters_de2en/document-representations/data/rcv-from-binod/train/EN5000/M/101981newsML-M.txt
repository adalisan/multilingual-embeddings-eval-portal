the dollar was stumped for inspiration in late European trade after an early drop , as the market threw its focus forward to U.S. data at the week &apos;s end . 
the U.S. currency was undermined by a firming mark , itself boosted when a Bundesbank council member urged clear , credible fulfilment of the European monetary union convergence criteria . 
Franz-Christoph Zeitler &apos;s call echoed Buba President Hans Tietmeyer &apos;s warning yesterday that countries should not &quot; window dress &quot; economic data in order to meet EMU requirements . 
the dollar shrugged off French prime minister Alain Juppe &apos;s assertion that it was chronically undervalued . 
&quot; It &apos;s just a reiteration of the Europeans &apos; total self-interest in enjoying a stronger dollar , which means weaker European currencies , which means more chances of export-driven growth , &quot; said Stephen Hannah , director of research at IBJ . 
the dollar was quoted at 1.5255 / 60 marks by 1509 GMT , off a session low of 1.5235 but down from late Monday &apos;s European level of 1.5306 / 11 . 
dollar / yen was steady at 111.27 / 32 versus late yesterday &apos;s 111.24 / 29 -- shaking off an early dip to 110.99 -- but dollar / Swiss franc fell to 1.2492 / 02 from its previous close here of 1.2555 / 65 . 
&quot; There &apos;s not anything which everyone &apos;s talking about that &apos;s the flavour of the moment -- it &apos;s just as and when orders come up , &quot; said Robin Poynder , chief forex dealer at Charterhouse . 
barring any surprise from the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday , analysts said there was little on the horizon likely to spur the dollar out of familiar ranges before Friday , when U.S. PPI and retail sales data for September appear . 
&quot; The market is looking for signals on U.S. inflation to see what the current state of probabilities is regarding a Fed hike next month , &quot; said Hannah , adding that the prevailing market expectation was for steady U.S. policy until next year . 
Japanese August current account figures , forecast to show a surplus of 474 billion yen compared to 648 billion last time , are due out at 2350 GMT tonight . 
analysts warned that the data could boost the yen at the dollar &apos;s expense if they indeed showed the surplus declining at a slower rate . 
elsewhere , the mark gained ground on the crosses although it was past its best in late trade . 
it was unfazed by a rise in German unemployment which economists said argued for easier monetary policy .
