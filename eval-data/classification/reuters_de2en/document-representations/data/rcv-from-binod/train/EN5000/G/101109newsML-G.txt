a volcano near the Papua New Guinea town of Rabaul which erupted on Friday and forced the evacuation of about 300 people has calmed down , officials said on Monday . 
&quot; There were one or two loud noises during the night but nothing to worry about , &quot; PNG national disaster and emergency services director leith Anderson told Reuters . 
he said people evacuated over the weekend were returning to their homes . 
Rabaul , a port town on New Britain Island 800 km ( 500 miles ) northeast of Port Moresby , was devastated in September 1994 when two volcanoes on either side of it erupted , forcing the evacuation of its 30,000 residents . 
five people died in the 1994 evacuation and during attempts to return to the town over the next few days to rescue belongings from looters . 
it was also shaken by an earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale in August last year . 
Tavurvur volcano erupted on Friday , spewing ash some 4,000 metres ( 13,200 feet ) into the air . 
the eruption lasted nearly three hours and lava flows continued over the weekend . 
its last serious eruption before 1994 was in 1937 when the volcano continued to be active for about four years , Anderson said . 
&quot; It could quite easily go on for a few more years -- it &apos;s something you can &apos;t tell , &quot; Anderson said . 
&quot; Or it could stop again tonight and come back again in another 50 or 60 years .
