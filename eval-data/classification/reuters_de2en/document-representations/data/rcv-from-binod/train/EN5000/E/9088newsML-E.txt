Zimbabwe &apos;s central bank has cut its rediscount rate by two percentage points to 27.5 percent , citing a downward trend in annual inflation , the bank said in a statement released on Thursday . 
&quot; Current projections show the rate of inflation falling to about 20 percent in December 1996 and further down to about 16 percent by June 1997 , &quot; the Bank said . 
Zimbabwe &apos;s annual consumer inflation rate dipped to 22.0 percent in July from 28 percent in January , helped down by a fall in food prices on the back of a good harvest this year . 
&quot; In line with this trend and in accordance with stated policy , the bank &apos;s rediscount rate has been reduced by two percentage points to 27.5 percent with immediate effect , &quot; it said in the statement dated August 20 but released on Thursday . 
the bank last cut its lending rate in November 1994 -- to 29.5 percent from 30 percent -- but has maintained a tight monetary policy over the past two years to fight resurgent inflation , blamed by local economists on high state spending .
