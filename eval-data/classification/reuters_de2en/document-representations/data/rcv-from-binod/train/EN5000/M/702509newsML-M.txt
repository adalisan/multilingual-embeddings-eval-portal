&quot; Just going into it there was definately a lack of interest , &quot; said one T-bill dealer with a bank-owned brokerage . 
&quot; It was definately a little bit sloppy . 
the auction , which produced an average yield of 3.193 percent had tail of 10 basis points and high-low spread of 19 basis points . 
the Government of Canada one-month cash T-bill traded with a yield of 3.22 percent in the wake of the auction , up from 2.95 percent at Monday &apos;s close . 
the dealer said the high average yield of the issue helped to attract some account buying after the initial release of auction results . 
concern about U.S. non-farm payrolls data tomorrow , the conclusion of the U.S. Federal Reserve &apos;s Open Market Committee meeting this afternoon were the large amount of supply all contributed to the lack of interest in the 35-day T-bill auction , said Rob Palombi , senior fixed-income analyst with mms International . 
Palombi said the poor results of the cash management bill were unlikely to have a major impact on this afternoon &apos;s auction . 
the Government of Canada this afternoon will auction C $ 4.7 billion in three-month , six-month and one-year T-bills .
