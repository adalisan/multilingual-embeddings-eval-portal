Socialist Prime Minister Costas Simitis won a parliamentary vote of confidence early on Sunday pledging to close the gap between Greece and its European Union partners through spending cuts and increased growth . 
Simitis was backed by 161 deputies in the 300-seat parliament while 134 voted against him and five were absent . 
his PASOK party scored an easy victory in elections last month which gave him an absolute majority of 162 seats . 
the vote came at the end of a three-day debate during which Simitis and his ministers told parliament that Greeks must make sacrifices so that the country will be able to join the European Monetary Union ( EMU ) by the year 2000 . 
&quot; The distance separating our economy from the rest of the EU countries is significant . 
we must decide to take the step that will bring us closer , &quot; Simitis said in his closing speech . 
&quot; Greece must participate in this effort ( to meet EMU criteria ) or else it will be set aside by its partners . 
he said upper middle-class Greeks will pay more taxes in 1997 to finance state deficits . 
&quot; Those who have the means will be called to contribute more , &quot; Simitis said . 
&quot; By the year 2000 our fiscal targets must be achieved and we must take brave decisions soon despite the cost . 
national Economy and Finance Minister Yannos Papandoniou said during the debate that targets for 1997 included a slash in the general government deficit by 3.4 percentage points and a drop in the average inflation by two percent . 
inflation was running at 8.5 percent in September , more than three times the EU average , and the EMU criteria call for an inflation rate of no more than two points above the three best EU performers . 
Papandoniou said the acceleration of public and private investments would boost GDP growth by three to 3.5 percent next year compared to 2.6 percent in 1996 . 
he said the government would introduce new laws before the presentation of the 1997 budget at the end of November which would freeze public hirings , and abolish tax breaks introduced by Simitis predecessor , late prime minister Andreas Papandreou . 
government officials have said they expect to raise some $ 1.8 billion from public spending cuts and the abolition of tax breaks in 1997 . 
but much of the money will go to finance a huge armaments programme in the next five years to deter territorial ambitions by neighbouring Turkey on Greek islands in the Aegean Sea . 
&quot; trillions of drachmas ( billions of dollars ) will be invested in the next five years to safeguard our national sovereignty , &quot; Defence Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos said . 
&quot; We have no choice . 
Simitis said during his pre-election campaign that the arms bill could be partly financed through foreign borrowing .
