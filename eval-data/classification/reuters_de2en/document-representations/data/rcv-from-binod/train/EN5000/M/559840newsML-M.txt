small cap stocks surged on Monday with the Russell 2000 and Nasdaq indexes posting impressive runs that , in a rare display , topped the strong gains of the mighty Dow Industrials on a percent basis . 
the Russell 2000 , a widely-used barometer for tracking small capitalization issues , jumped 2.39 percent to close up 8.45 points at 362.43 . 
the Nasdaq composite Index was also sharply higher , up 2.60 percent , or 34 points , to 1339 . 
adding to strength in the sector , prudential Securities analyst Claudia Mott turned bullish on small-cap stocks . 
&quot; Its a real change of opinion for me to be the least bit positive , &quot; she said in a telephone interview . 
speculation about a cut in the capital gains tax on profits from the sale of stocks helped trigger the gains . 
&quot; We &apos;ve got a sellers &apos; strike going on . 
if you own these stocks , why sell ? 
&quot; said Salomon Brothers &apos; analyst David Shulman . 
he said it was no coincidence that small caps started surging on Friday afternoon after word came that a budget agreement might be reached in Washington . 
on Friday , the Nasdaq rocketed 2.7 percent to 1305 . 
the Russell jumped 2.4 percent to nearly 354 . 
Mott said the next six months &quot; could be gangbusters &quot; for small caps . 
she cited their severe underperformance , cheap valuations , the easing of flows out of small cap mutual funds and the possibility of the capital gains tax cut . 
small caps have performed dismally compared with the equity of larger companies over the past year . 
for the past 12 months , the Russell 2000 index has fallen &quot; a whopping 20.02 percent -- the second worst trailing 12- month performance in the history of the index , &quot; according to prudential . 
Mott , the chief of small cap research , also said attention tends to shift onto the Russell as investors try to guess the changes that will take place when the index is rebalanced at the end of June , as it is every year . 
selling pressure has also abated as the sharp outflow of money out of small cap mutual funds abated recently . 
&quot; So many money managers were dealing with redemptions and they &apos;ve had to sell stock to fund the redemptions , &quot; she said . 
the Dow Industrials also roared to a record high , up 144 points to 7215 . 
but the index actually trailed the small caps stocks on a percent basis , rising only 2.03 percent . 
but both small cap experts were quick to point out that the rally could be short-lived , especially in the face of a possible rise in interest rates . 
second quarter earnings performance could also quash a rally . 
&quot; More people are ignoring the possibility of a rate hike , and they do so at their peril , &quot; said Shulman , Salomon &apos;s chief equity strategist . 
&quot; Because I think we will get a tightening &quot; by the Federal Reserve sometime this year . 
in a report released ahead of the run-up in small cap stocks in the past two sessions , Dean Witter &apos;s chief investment strategist Peter Canelo said a sustainable recovering might be &quot; in the offing &quot; for small caps if the Fed raises rates only once or twice more . 
&quot; But should the Fed push rates ... more than 50 basis points from current levels , even a capital gains tax rate cut might do little more than provide a temporary reprieve in the ongoing bear market in smaller capitalization issues , &quot; Canelo said in the report . 
the Russell 2000 &apos;s gains were the second- and third-largest daily advances since the index &apos;s inception in January 1987 , according to the Frank Russell company . 
among the 33 companies Mott said are quantitatively attractive were Arvin Industries Inc , Aviall Inc , Cyrix Corp , Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co , Hutchinson Technology Inc , IHOP Corp , Innovex Inc , New England Business Service Inc , Standard Products Co , Techne Corp , Wall Data Inc and zebra Technologies .
