the Hang Seng index &apos;s push into record territory should provide a timely boost to sentiment for initial public offerings ( IPOs ) in Hong Kong after investors gave some recent listings a poor reception , analysts said . 
&quot; Activity in the IPO market is expected to pick up , &quot; said Patrick Cheng , corporate finance director at HSBC Investment Bank Asia . 
&quot; The recent rally in the stock market , plus relatively high liquidity , is a positive sign for the market . 
the Hang Seng soared 721.10 points , or 4.61 percent , last week to close at 16,379.22 on Friday , while recording a record intraday high of 16,449.53 during the session . 
analysts said a recent flurry of trading suspensions had dampened investor interest in smaller stocks , prompting a switch into IPOs . 
&quot; More retail investors will go back to the new issues due to the recent and frequent trading suspensions in second- and third-line stocks , &quot; said Ricky Tam , senior research manager at Delta Asia Securities . 
twenty-one stocks were suspended from trade last week , either because of unusual share price movements and turnover fluctuations or pending corporate announcements . 
the poor performance of recent new issues , linked to a quieter market following Hong Kong &apos;s return to Chinese rule on July 1 and weakness in property stocks , was only likely to have a mild impact on future IPOs , the analysts said . 
the public offering of Angang New Steel Co Ltd , the first new listing in Hong Kong under Chinese rule , was only 99.7 percent subscribed . 
the stock ended its trading debut on July 24 at HK $ 1.70 , 4.3 percent higher than its issue price . 
shares of Winsan ( China ) Investment Group Co Ltd , whose Hong Kong IPO was 1.3 times subscribed , dived below their issue price on their market debut on July 25 , ending at HK $ 1.84 each against the issue price of HK $ 2.01 . 
China Southern Airlines Co Ltd shares , whose Hong Kong IPO was 2.44 times subscribed , ended their July 31 debut 31 3.72 percent above their issue price , at HK $ 4.875 . 
&quot; Many investors were sidelined due to concern about the property sector . 
people also preferred to stay away to see what Hong Kong would be like after the handover , &quot; said Cheng . 
&quot; The transition ran very smoothly . 
nothing major happened that would affect people &apos;s confidence in Hong Kong . 
Guangdong brewery Holdings Ltd and CASIL Telecommunications Holdings Ltd are expected to receive a warm response when they are listed in Hong Kong , thanks to the strong backing of their China parents and bright earnings prospects . 
Guangdong brewery , a unit of Guangdong Investment Ltd , is expected to see a subscription rate of about 200 times for its IPO which closed last week , market sources said . 
dealing is due to begin on August 8 . 
CASIL , a unit of China Aerospace International Holdings Ltd , could register a subscription rate of more than 50 times , the sources added . 
it issued 150 million shares at HK $ 1.18 each , which are expected to begin trading on August 11 . 
but telecommunications services provider City Telecom ( HK ) Ltd could make a weak debut on Monday with investors worried about keen competition in the industry , analysts said . 
the company offered 100 million shares at HK $ 1.80 each in Hong Kong . 
the stock is due to make its debut on August 7 .
