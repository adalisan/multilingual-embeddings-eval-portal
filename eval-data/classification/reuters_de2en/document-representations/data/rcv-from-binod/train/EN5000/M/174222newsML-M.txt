a strong Euro could in time edge out existing reserve currencies such as the dollar and yen , Dutch central bank governor Wim Duisenberg , the future head of the European Monetary Institute , predicted on Thursday . 
&quot; A stable Euro could win ground from the dollar as a reserve currency , &quot; Duisenberg said in a speech to mark the opening of an international investors fair in Duesseldorf . 
a text of the speech was made available to journalists prior to delivery . 
&quot; At present the dollar is the dominant currency ... for transactions on most export markets ... ( but ) invoicing / payment in euro rather than dollars could become customary , &quot; he said . 
this was because U.S. suppliers could in future be outnumbered by Eurobloc suppliers in markets such as chemicals where they were currently dominant , Duisenberg said . 
&quot; The bigger the role of the euro in ( international ) payments traffic the more attractive it becomes as a reserve currency , &quot; he added . 
furthermore economic and monetary union ( EMU ) would offer investors from outside the EMU-bloc more investment opportunities than existing national markets , he said . 
while the introduction of a single European currency would have a limited impact on share markets in the short-term , bond markets would undergo a sea-change , Duisenberg said . 
existing currency segments would fall away , with the creditworthiness of the issuing institutions becoming a much stronger factor in investment decisions . 
&quot; In the absence of exchange rate risk , price differences between bonds will be determined by debtor risk and , to a lesser extent , differences in liquidity , &quot; Duisenberg said . 
debt issues by EMU member states will be denominated in euros from January 1 , 1999 , and Duisenberg said he expected other market players , particularly multinationals , to immediately follow suit . 
Duisenberg said fixed-income investors would likely spread their portfolios wider in the absence of exchange rate risk , but that in doing so they would more frequently be faced with unfamiliar borrowers . 
&quot; The creation of a deeper Euro-capital market will thus bring with it an increasingly important role for credit ratings , &quot; he predicted , adding that it was conceivable that after EMU all new bond issues would be accompanied by a credit rating , as is customary in the U.S. 
the switch to a single European currency would significantly boost competition in the financial sector , particularly on the professional markets . 
large-scale players would have the edge on the new issues market , he said , but the size of a new Euromarket could offer financial institutions greater opportunities to specialise .
