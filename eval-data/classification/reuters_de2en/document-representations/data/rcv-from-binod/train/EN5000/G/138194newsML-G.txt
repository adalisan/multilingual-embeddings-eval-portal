a military prosecutor said on Wednesday that he had sought the indictment of a second former SS officer on a charge of involvement in the worst atrocity in Italy in World War Two . 
the prosecutor , Antonino Intelisano , said he had asked judges to charge former SS major Karl ( corrects from Erich ) Hass with complicity in multiple murder over the massacre of 335 men and boys at the Ardeatine caves south of Rome in March 1944 . 
the charge is the same as that against former SS captain Erich Priebke , whose re-trial was ordered this month by an appeal court which annulled a controversial military court verdict that he could not be punished for the crime . 
&quot; If the indictment is accepted then we would try the two men together , &quot; Intelisano told Reuters . 
Intelisano said he expected the indictment hearing for Hass , 84 , to take place around November 20 and that a trial would probably begin from mid-December . 
Hass is living under police supervision at a clinic in Rome where he is recovering from a fractured pelvis . 
he injured himself last June trying to clamber over a hotel balcony and flee on the eve of testimony as a prosecution witness at Priebke &apos;s original military court trial . 
Hass , whose home is in Switzerland , eventually testified from a hospital bed . 
both he and Priebke , 83 , have admitted to shooting two of the 335 caves victims , 75 of whom were Jews . 
they were rounded up and shot at the caves in a reprisal for a bombing by Italian partisans which killed 33 German soldiers . 
Priebke also drew up lists of the victims but pleaded at his first trial that he was following orders and would have been killed had he disobeyed . 
&quot; Their level of responsibility ( in the massacre ) may be different but the charge against them is the same , &quot; Intelisano said . 
Priebke was extradited from Argentina to Italy last November and has since been held in jail on remand . 
his trial ended in uproar on August 1 when the panel of three judges decided in a split verdict that while he was guilty of multiple murder he could not be punished because of mitigating circumstances and expiry of a statute of limitation . 
angry protesters laid siege to the military court , trapping Priebke and the judges inside in a stand-off which ended after several hours when Priebke was re-arrested . 
the Court of Cassation , Italy &apos;s highest appeal court , voided the initial verdict last week . 
Germany has asked Italy to extradite Priebke and Hass for a war crimes trial there . 
the Italian legal process takes precedence over the request .
