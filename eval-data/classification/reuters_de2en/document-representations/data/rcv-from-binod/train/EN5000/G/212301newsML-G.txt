more than 5,000 impoverished Croatian pensiors protested in Zagreb on Saturday in demand for &quot; a dignified life &quot; in a fresh challenge to government policies . 
displaying banners telling the conservative authorities &quot; You Are Getting Rich While We Are starving &quot; , and &quot; You Eat Meat , We Get bones &quot; , they demanded a 40 percent increase in their pensions . 
an austerity programme imposed in Croatia since 1993 has caused wide poverty outside the ruling elite . 
President Franjo Tudjman &apos;s HDZ party has been accused of corruption and economic malpractices for its privatisation policies that created a class of newly rich . 
pensioners make up a large portion of the Croatian population . 
their previous appeals to the government for more money yielded no result . 
pensions in Croatia average $ 150 a month . 
cornered by demands for higher salaries , the government has announced plans to launch a new social welfare law in 1997 , foreseeing higher expenditures and improved social justice . 
on Thursday about 100,000 people rallied in Zagreb to support a popular radio station the government tried to shut down in the largest protest since Croatia gained independence in 1991 . 
the protest grew into a public demand for more democracy in the country .
