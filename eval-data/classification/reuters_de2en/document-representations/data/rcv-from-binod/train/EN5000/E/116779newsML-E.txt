Argentina Tuesday scrapped a special Customs handling fee for foreign trade which will generate savings of $ 500 million , DGI tax service and Customs chief Carlos Silvani said . 
&quot; From now on any person or company will be able to carry out proceedings to dispatch merchandise , without being forced to use the services of Customs handlers , &quot; Silvani told a news conference . 
those handlers charged between 0.5 percent and 3.0 percent of the cost of the merchandise . 
Silvani said a new decree signed by President Carlos Menem deregulating foreign trade would &quot; facilitate the placement of our products abroad ... lowering operational costs and improving the real exchange rate . 
&quot; There is a pressing need to simplify all foreign trade proceedings , &quot; he said .
