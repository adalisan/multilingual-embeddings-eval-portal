former right-wing contra rebels kidnapped members of a Nicaraguan government peace commission who were travelling to disarm them on Tuesday , an army spokesman said . 
the Northern Front 3-80 contra group had planned to surrender its arms at the village of Kuskawaas , in the northern mountains of Nicaragua , but instead kidnapped five members of the commission there early in the morning , army spokesman Milton Sandoval told Reuters . 
unconfirmed radio reports said up to 45 people might have been abducted but Sandoval said he only had confirmation of five -- four soldiers from a special Disarmament Brigade and a church leader , Gustavo Parajon . 
&quot; The kidnap is confirmed , it happened at 0500 hours local time ( 1100 GMT ) and was ( carried out by ) El Cadejo &apos;s group , &quot; Sandoval said . 
&quot; El Cadejo &quot; is the nickname of a militant leader among the remnants of the former contras . 
backed by then-U.S. president Ronald Reagan , the contras waged war on Nicaragua &apos;s Sandinista revolutionary government during the 1980s . 
although Nicaragua now has its second democratically elected non-Sandinista president , small groups of former contra rebels are still active in remote regions .
