Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto concluded a brief visit to the Netherlands on Wednesday by laying a wreath at a monument to Dutch victims of Japan &apos;s World War Two occupation of the Dutch East Indies . 
sheltered by an umbrella to protect him from a light drizzle , Hashimoto emerged from his limousine and approached the monument in the company of Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok . 
he placed the white floral wreath on a stand , stepped back and made two solemn bows . 
Dutch war historians estimate that almost 20,000 Dutch civilians and prisoners of war perished in Japanese detention camps , succumbing to malnutrition , disease and exhaustion . 
Japanese troops took some 37,000 Dutch prisoners of war and interned some 80,000 civilians in the former colony which has been known as Indonesia since its independence after the war . 
about 200 Dutch women and girls were kept as sex slaves , euphemistically referred to at the time as &quot; comfort women &quot; . 
a small group of camp survivors turned out to present a petition to Hashimoto in which they sought an apology from the Japanese government and compensation for their suffering . 
but they were denied access to the prime minister and the petition was accepted on his behalf by the Japanese ambassador . 
speaking at a news conference before visiting the monument , Hashimoto spoke of Japan &apos;s &quot; deep remorse &quot; for past misdeeds . 
&quot; We accept with humility the fact that Japan &apos;s actions caused untold suffering , &quot; he said . 
Hashimoto was in the Netherlands to attend the annual summit meeting between Japan and the European Union . 
he was due to fly to Norway for a visit later on Wednesday .
