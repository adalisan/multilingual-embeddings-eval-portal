Donald brash , governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand , on Friday said he sees strong support for his country &apos;s law that requires the central bank to seek low inflation as its key objective . 
&quot; Market research commissioned by the Bank recently suggested that 63 percent of the public were aware that delivering low inflation was the Bank &apos;s key objective , and 73 percent were in favor of that objective , &quot; brash said in a paper he delivered to a symposium here that is being sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City . 
brash pointed out that within the business and farming communities there are some groups under pressure from weak commodity prices who have asked whether there might be non- monetary means of curbing inflation . 
&quot; However , &quot; brash added , &quot; almost unanimously , those same people are very quick to reject any thought of a return to the days of high and variable inflation .
