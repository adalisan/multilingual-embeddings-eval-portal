the Greek government is not planning to impose a 10 percent one-off charge on corporate profits proposed by a recent report on achieving convergence targets , National Economy and Finance Minister Yannos Papandoniou said . 
&quot; The government is not planning to impose new surprise taxes on anyone , &quot; Papandoniou told Athens daily &quot; Ta Nea &quot; , in an interview published today . 
referring to press reports that the one-off charge recommended by economics professor Yiannos Spraos could be used to combat unemployment , Papandoniou said the government had &quot; more contemporary , expedient and decisive &quot; ways to deal with the pressing problem of unemployment . 
these included plans to establish a company to handle the Greek state &apos;s holdings and inflows from the privatisation programme . 
&quot; With this capital we will finance investments both in projects and in human capital and with these resources we will be able to bolster our employment policy ... The idea that for each new policy you need a new tax is outdated , &quot; he said .
