prominent Gambian barrister Ousseynou Darboe has said he plans to form a political party and run against military ruler Captain Yahya Jammeh in next month &apos;s presidential election . 
Jammeh has banned the three main political parties but two smaller parties have said they plan to put up candidates provided they can meet tough registration conditions . 
&quot; I was contacted by a cross-section of the community from Banjul to up-country and asked to contest the presidential elections , &quot; Darboe , vice-chairman of the influential Gambia Bar Association , said on Friday . 
he said he would submit his application to the electoral commission next week . 
Darboe said he intended to protest to the minister of local government about public figures such as traditional chiefs who were already campaigning on behalf of Jammeh . 
a decree published last Wednesday said anyone involved in politics before campaigning officially starts on September 9 would face a fine of one million dalasis ( $ 100,000 ) or life imprisonment . 
Jammeh has said he will stand as a civilian candidate in the September 26 election but will not campaign as he does not want to get involved in politics . 
candidates must gather 5,000 signatures from around the country by the September 5 registration deadline . 
the Commonwealth said on Tuesday the election rules were flawed and would allow the small West African country &apos;s military leaders to strengthen their grip on power . 
the Commonwealth last year suspended the membership of army-ruled Nigeria . 
Gambia &apos;s military rulers lifted a two-year ban on all political activity on August 14 , then announced two days later that the country &apos;s three main parties would be excluded . 
they banned anyone who had served as a minister under ousted president Sir Dawda Jawara , head of state from independence from Britain in 1965 until 1994 , and excluded Jawara &apos;s People &apos;s Progressive Party , the National Convention Party of Sheriff Mustapha Dibba , and Hassan Musa Camara &apos;s Gambia People &apos;s Party .
