prisoners armed with makeshift weapons took four prison officers hostage in Dublin &apos;s Mountjoy Prison on Saturday night , officials said . 
the convicts , whose weapons included iron bars and a blood-filled syringe , were demanding a move from the prison &apos;s segregation unit . 
six prison officers were originally taken hostage . 
but two were later freed , one being sent to the prison governor to ask Justice Department officials to intervene . 
none of the four remaining hostages were thought to be injured . 
one of the prisoners involved in the protest is believed to be Paul Ward , facing conspiracy-to-murder charges in connection with the fatal shooting of investigative crime journalist Veronica Guerin . 
the Victorian prison has long suffered from severe overcrowding and drug-taking .
