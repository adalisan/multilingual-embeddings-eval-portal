SIMEX Nikkei futures ended fractionally firmer in thin trade on Friday , but dealers said the market looked set to make further gains . 
a news report quoting a Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) official saying the central bank was worried about an excessive fall in long-term interest rates pushed the benchmark Nikkei 225 December contract briefly to a low of 21,460 , dealers said . 
but it recovered to close 10 points above its previous settlement of 21,540 on volume of a mere 10,375 lots . 
&quot; Domestic and foreign investors are looking for dips to buy shares as long as dollar / yen doesn &apos;t collapse , &quot; said a dealer with a Japanese futures house . 
he said the market was likely to be buoyed by expectations of Japanese general elections on October 20 after Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto dissolved parliament on Friday . 
&quot; The Japanese government is weak now . 
hopefully , after the elections the ruling party will consolidate its power , &quot; said the trader . 
he said the December Nikkei should find support around 21,400 , but would need to clear 21,700 before heading higher .
