the Mexican peso ceded some earlier gains at the close on Tuesday after dealers decided to buy back some dollars they had sold , but at cheaper prices , traders said . 
&quot; I saw a lot of irrational ( dollar ) selling this morning ... , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; There was no dollar inflow ... for the peso to have firmed so much . 
the benchmark 48-hour peso and its 24-hour stablemate ended 0.45 and 0.6 of a centavo firmer , respectively , at 7.9750 / 7.9780 and 7.9720 / 7.9740 per dollar . 
the 48-hour peso had earlier firmed to 7.9650 / 7.9780 per dollar in mid-morning trade . 
same-day peso contracts closed mid-morning 1.7 centavos firmer at 7.9570 / 7.9620 per dollar . 
&quot; Dealers went short dollars at 7.9700 per dollar in the hope the peso would get stronger , but it didn &apos;t work so they had to buy back dollars , &quot; another trader said . 
&quot; It was sheer speculation . 
even locals who tried to firm the peso ended up having to buy dollars , &quot; he added . 
dealers said forecast gains in domestic interest rates at the central bank &apos;s primary auction tonight only partly justified a firmer peso . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see there being much demand at the Cetes auction . 
I didn &apos;t see many foreigners buying pesos to bid for Cetes , and the market won &apos;t like that . 
you may see the peso soften because of that tomorrow , &quot; a dealer said . 
nine money market dealers surveyed by Reuters predicted Banco de Mexico would assign bellwether 28-day Cetes at an average of 20.77 percent . 
this would be an increase of 147 basis points . 
Banco de Mexico was due to announce the results of its primary action at 1830 local time / 2330 GMT .
