the United States was disapointed with the results of Canadian foreign minister Lloyd Axworthy &apos;s recent trip to Cuba , a senior Clinton administration official said on Monday . 
Axworthy was the top Canadian official to visit the Communist-ruled island in two decades when he went to Havana in January for talks with Cuban President Fidel Castro and other officials . 
&quot; We appreciate the efforts of the Canadian government to try to promote democracy and human rights , and we know that it was in that spirit that the foreign minister went to Cuba , &quot; Commerce Undersecretary Stuart Eizenstat said . 
&quot; We were disappointed with the results , &quot; added Eizenstat , who is also Clinton &apos;s special envoy for Cuban affairs , during a conference on the so-called Helms-Burton law hosted by U.S. , Canadian and European think tanks . 
despite being close allies and trading partners , Ottawa and Washington differ sharply on their policies toward Cuba . 
the United States has kept an embargo against Cuba for over 35 years while Canada has good relations with Castro &apos;s government and is a major investor in the island . 
they also are at odds over the Helms-Burton law , a U.S. legislation that penalizes foreign companies doing business with properties confiscated from Americans in Cuba . 
Eizenstat noted that only two of some 14 points in a joint declaration Axworthy signed in Cuba dealt with human rights . 
one referred to the creation of a &quot; complaints office &quot; within Cuba &apos;s parliament for citizens to voice grievances . 
&quot; We had hoped that there would be an ombudsman office , separate from the government ... that would have provided a forum for Cuban citizens to register complaints about deprivations of human rights , &quot; Eizenstat said . 
&quot; Instead , they have a complaints office that could be complaints that your electricity is not working , and , rather than being at arm &apos;s length , it &apos;s in the National Assembly , which is a thoroughly government-controlled or Communist-dominated institution , &quot; he added . 
the United States was also dismayed by the fact that the communique seemed to favor only Canadian nongovernmental organizations operating in the island . 
&quot; So , one has to say , for the first visit of a Canadian foreign minister ( to Cuba ) in 37 years , we would have hoped for more , &quot; added Eizenstat , who nevertheless said Washington knew that Ottawa had made a sincere effort . 
Canadian officials have defended their policy towards Cuba pointing out that U.S. sanctions have failed to weaken Castro , who has been in power since 1959 .
