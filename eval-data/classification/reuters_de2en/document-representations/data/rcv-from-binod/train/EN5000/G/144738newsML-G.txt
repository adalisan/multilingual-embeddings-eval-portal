the European Union will increase pressure on Burma over human rights on Monday , suspending all high-level visits there and refusing visas to members of Burma &apos;s ruling Council , EU diplomats said on Friday . 
the decision is expected at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg . 
a plan to impose new restrictions on Rangoon was agreed earlier this week by senior officials and is expected to be approved without debate by the ministers . 
Burma &apos;s military government has caused international protest by detaining a top official in Nobel Peace laureate &apos;s Aung San Suu Kyi &apos;s National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party . 
moves due to be agreed include banning entry visas for members of the SLORC and their families and for top members of the military or security forces viewed as impeding democracy in Burma . 
it would also ban EU ministers and other top officials from visiting Burma . 
the EU would renew for six months its existing sanctions against Burma , which include a suspension of non-humanitarian aid or development programmes . 
diplomats and party sources in Rangoon say Kyi Maung , deputy chairman of the NLD and one of Suu Kyi &apos;s closest confidants , was detained for questioning by SLORC on Tuesday . 
describing the arrest as an outrage , Amnesty International said Kyi Maung had done nothing more than call for peaceful political change . 
the SLORC on Wednesday accused him of colluding with some students involved in an early-morning protest .
