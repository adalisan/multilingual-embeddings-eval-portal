* T-bill auction rates seen moving sideways 
the Philippine overnight rate inched higher to 11.09375 percent from 11.0625 percent as banks tapped the interbank market to cover their reserve deficiencies , traders said . 
&quot; This is just the usual Monday rate uptick , &quot; one trader said . 
interbank trades done on Mondays are valued the previous Fridays , so banks which have deficiencies over the weekend try to make up on Mondays . 
value turnover rose to 22.308 billion pesos with rates ranging from a low of 11.0625 percent to a high of 11.25 percent . 
twenty-nine financial institutions lent out money , while 26 others were on the borrowing side . 
the rate hike was marginal since the system received fresh funds of around 6.0 billion pesos from maturing Treasury notes , one trader said . 
the new inflow has also prompted banks to keep the secondary Treasury bill rates steady . 
many of them were expecting the rates to remain unchanged during the auction . 
banks were selling their three-month bills between 11.45 to 11.5 percent , and buying bills with rates of 11.525 to 11.6 percent . 
six months bills were being bidded between 11.90 percent to 12.05 percent , and offered between 11.75 percent to 11.95 percent . 
one-year bills at 12.65 to 12.75 percent on the bid side , and offered between 12.575 and 12.625 percent .
