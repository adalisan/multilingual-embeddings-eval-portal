a total of 252 offshore companies were registered in Malta in 1996 , up 16.6 per cent over the 1995 figure , a report issued on Wednesday said . 
the annual report of the Malta Financial Services Centre ( MCFS ) , said that last year put an end to the distinction between offshore and onshore companies engaged in international business operations . 
the new registrations mean that 2,400 offshore companies were listed since the register was open on June 30 , 1989 . 
at the end of 1996 the number of offshore companies stood at 1,401 , of which 617 were in general trading and 784 were non-trading . 
existing offshore companies are allowed continue to operate until 2004 and may in the meantime convert to onshore companies . 
during 1996 , 49 offshore companies converted to onshore companies while a further 194 new international trading and holding companies opened headquarters . 
the report says the Malta Financial Centre further strengthened its foothold in investment services and banking activities in 1996 with 18 investment services licences being issued to 17 companies and one trader . 
Bannister said that competition remained intense . 
&quot; We are being judged by the quality of service that we provide to financial institutions , and we continue to be committed to maintaining the highest possible standards in the services we offer , &quot; he said . 
the Centre &apos;s regulatory and supervisory roles have been enhanced and will include shortly regulation of international companies seeking a listing on the Malta Stock Exchange among other changes expected next year .
