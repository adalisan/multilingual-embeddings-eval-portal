U.S. West Coast refined oil product prices were steady in subdued midday talk , with traders saying trade would not liven up until the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) releases its stocks data tonight . 
some feared the apparent return to service of Chevron &apos;s Los Angeles-area catalytic cracking unit in El Segundo over the weekend would put downward pressure in a market already aching from poor refining profit margins . 
they said the bullish effects of a coker fire at Mobil &apos;s Los Angeles area refinery could thus be muted by the return of the Chevron unit . 
Chevron could not be reached for comment . 
traders said the Mobil coking unit could be back in service within a week , though Mobil officials were not immediately available to comment on the talk . 
Mobil previously declined to comment on the outage , citing company policy . 
offers on gasoline generally slipped but bidding was too thin to assess whether any weakness had spread to buyers . 
regular CARB-grade cleaner burning gasoline was offered in Los Angeles a quarter cent cheaper at 65.75 cents a gallon , while regular conventional gasoline offers slipped 0.50 cent to 62.50 cents a galllon .
