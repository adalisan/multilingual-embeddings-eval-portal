a group of Greek conservative opposition deputies asked the Justice Ministry on Wednesday to release imprisoned former dictator George Papadopoulos , who is hospitalised in critical condition . 
in a petition to the minister , 38 New Democracy deputies said Papadopoulos , 78 , who led a 1967 coup and subsequent seven-year dictatorship , was suffering from a rare terminal disease and should be freed on humanitarian reasons . 
&quot; He is in his 24th year in jail and in his sixth month in hospital , &quot; the petition said . 
&quot; Are you prepared to begin the process of terminating the execution of his sentence due to danger to his life or irreperable damage to his health ? 
the former army colonel was convicted of high treason in 1975 and sentenced to death along with other coup leaders but their senteces were later commuted to life in prison . 
previous attempts by the conservatives when in power to free them on humanitarian grounds have met a storm of protest from leftist parties and groups representing the thousands of Greeks exiled and tortured during the seven-year junta . 
the justice ministry turned down a pardon request by four coup leaders in 1994 , when a socialist government was in power . 
Papadopoulos , who has been on life support machines and under guard at an Athens state hospital for months , had vowed never to seek a pardon because he believed his dictatorship stopped communism from taking over Greece . 
&quot; Our democracy is strong and not in danger from a elderly man of 78 years who suffers a rare , severe and terminal illness , &quot; the deputies &apos; petition said .
