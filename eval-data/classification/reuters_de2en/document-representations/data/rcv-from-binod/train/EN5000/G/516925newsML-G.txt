Slovenia &apos;s government , seeking to join the European Union ( EU ) , said on Thursday it had passed a draft law on association and would send the proposal to parliament shortly . 
&quot; The agreement was passed and will be sent to parliament in a few days along with additional supplements , &quot; Marta Kos , director of the government &apos;s Public Relations and Media Office , told Reuters . 
the association agreement , a trade and cooperation pact that carries with it a promise of eventual EU membership , was signed in June 1996 but has yet to be ratified by most EU member parliaments . 
Kos said the necessary supplements consisted of a blueprint of Slovenia &apos;s strategy for EU entry , a list of new laws that have to be introduced and a three-year programme of bringing Slovenia &apos;s existing legislation into line with EU standards . 
sources close to the government said the draft was most likely to be sent to parliament next week . 
Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek said on Wednesday he expected parliament to ratify the agreement next month . 
European Commission President Jaques Santer last week said Slovenia &apos;s ratification was a precondition for the country to be included in the first round of nations to start negotiations on EU membership , probably in early 1998 . 
Slovenia hopes to become a member of the EU as soon as possible and so far is the only successor state of the former Yugoslavia that has signed an EU association agreement .
