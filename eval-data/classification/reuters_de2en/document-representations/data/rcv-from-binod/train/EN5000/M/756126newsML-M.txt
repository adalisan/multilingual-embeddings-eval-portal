NWE high sulphur fuel oil prices softened on Friday despite gains in crude oil futures as demand for bunker fuel flagged and more supplies of Russian fuel appeared on the horizon , traders said . 
high sulphur barges traded at $ 89 fob Ara for prompt stored material in the morning and then rose to trade between $ 90 and $ 91 , before prices fell back to $ 89 / 90 . 
high sulphur cargoes were thinly talked but players said that new supplies of Russian material were appearing . 
one regular buyer suggested 120,000 tonnes of cracked Russian fuel oil would load in Klaipeda and St Petersburg before August 5 . 
another said he expected some 150,000 tonnes by August 10 . 
these avails follow a period of scarcity in the Baltic which has taken E-4 straight-run premiums up to $ 7- $ 8 over the mean / mean / mean of published quotes . 
low sulphur cracked cargoes were steady to weaker . 
a 20-25,000 tonne prompt cargo was heard sold by an NWE refiner on Thursday to a trader at $ 95 fob NWE , to co-load with another cargo already owned by the same trader , and this was thought likely to move to Israel . 
but dealers suggested low sulphur material would be worth a dollar or so less than this on Friday .
