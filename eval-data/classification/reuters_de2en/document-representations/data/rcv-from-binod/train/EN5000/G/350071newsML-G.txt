Algeria &apos;s independent newspaper El Watan said on Sunday that 31 people had been killed in the Algerian town of Medea , with their throats cut and heads severed . 
&quot; More than 30 people had their throats cut this night , &quot; the paper , normally well informed on security matters , quoted a resident as saying late on Saturday . 
&quot; They are going soon to wipe out the whole town , in silence . 
we can no long continue to endure all these horrors ... Public opinion must be alerted , &quot; the resident told the newspaper . 
EL Watan carried the report in the face of a warning last week to the press from the Interior Ministry that it would act against the media , some of which it accused of inflating figures of killings . 
on Friday , as Algeria was mourning the assassination earlier last week of its most powerful trade union leader Abdelhak Benhamouda , Algerian security forces in a statement said eight people had been killed in nearby Sidi Moussa district during the night of Wednesday to Thursday . 
according to the resident quoted by El Watan , the latest massacre was carried out on the night of Friday to Saturday by around 50 &quot; terrorists &quot; -- the term usually used in Algeria for Moslem fundamentalists , who have been fighting for five years to try to overthrow the Algerian authorities .
