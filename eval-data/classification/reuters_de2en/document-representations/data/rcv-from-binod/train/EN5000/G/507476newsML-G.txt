labour leader Tony Blair &apos;s carefully nurtured relations with the British media took a knock on Monday when outraged newsmen accompanying him on his election tour claimed they were being asked to pay for his staff &apos;s hotel bills . 
journalists checking out after a night at the luxury Hyatt Regency hotel in Birmingham , latest stop on the opposition leader &apos;s campaign , were presented with a 148 pound ( $ 240 ) bill . 
when some checked the cost with the hotel &apos;s marketing director , Roddy Gordon , he told them : &quot; You are all journalists , you are going to find out anyway -- the Labour Party have asked us to mark up the rates . 
furious political correspondents , whose papers are giving Labour more backing than they have received from the media for decades , surrounded Labour press officer Leslie Smith to demand an explanation . 
eventually , she told them it was all a &quot; cock up &quot; and promised 40 pound refunds all round . 
&quot; There was confusion rather than conspiracy . 
we are very sorry and we are happy to put it right , &quot; Smith said . 
but the refund did not totally satisfy journalists who pushed Smith to tell them whether the media was effectively paying for rooms for herself and other key Blair aides . 
Smith said she was unclear whether hotel bills for a few party staff were being subsidised either by the price of journalists &apos; hotel rooms or by the 7,500 pounds cost of a &quot; season ticket &quot; seat on the Blair &quot; battlebus &quot; for the six-week campaign ahead of the May 1 election . 
the price is similar to that being charged by the ruling Conservatives for a seat about the bus of Prime Minister John Major . 
the row ensured that coverage of a keynote speech by Blair on education -- the topic he has said will be the passion of the government he hopes to form -- was sparse . 
the speech was billed as the start of a new positive phase of the Labour campaign , designed to halt a small slide in its opinion poll ratings to around 17 points ahead of the Conservatives . 
Blair pledged that as his plans to get more young people off welfare succeeded , he would ensure that a greater proportion of government income went on projects such as cutting class sizes . 
&quot; Education is social justice , education is liberty , education is opportunity . 
education is the key to the future of this country , &quot; he said .
