there was a time when , with a single call , left-wing Sandinistas could paralyse the country . 
but years spent in opposition have weakened their influence over the masses -- a blessing to new President Arnoldo Aleman . 
Sandinista leaders fumed as Aleman won Nicaragua &apos;s Oct . 20 election , alleging fraud . 
then , as the burly right-winger took office on Jan . 10 , they warned of street protests as Aleman placed supporters in almost all positions of power , shutting out the Sandinistas . 
former Sandinista President Daniel Ortega warned of a looming dictatorship by Aleman &apos;s Liberal Alliance and refused to rule out violent protests . 
Nicaraguans had waited tensely to see how the legendary Sandinista militants , known for their boisterous street protests , would react . 
but the feared social explosion ended in a whimper . 
&quot; They have clearly lost much of their ability to summon the people to the streets , and unless they adapt to the new reality they are going to lose more , &quot; political analyst and former Sandinista Oscar Rene Vargas told Reuters . 
even among die-hard Sandinistas there was a resigned acceptance of Aleman &apos;s right-wing rule and a feeling that the era of street protests and popular mobilisation was past . 
&quot; The times have changed . 
it seems we Nicaraguans have been fighting forever , and a lot of my friends are tired of confrontation , &quot; Carmen Quintana , a Sandinista supporter who sells tamales in a Managua street market , said . 
unable to summon popular outrage , contrite Sandinista leaders , led by Daniel Ortega and his brother Humberto , filed into Aleman &apos;s presidential office earlier this week for a series of historic meetings billed as the start of a reconciliation between the bitter rivals . 
the agreement to meet Aleman marked a major turnaround for Ortega who had refused to acknowledge the new government &apos;s legitimacy , claiming its election win was fraudulent . 
&quot; I think this attitude on the part of the Sandinistas , especially the openness of Ortega , reflects a new orientation by the Sandinista Front based on their realisation they have no possibility of returning to power through coups , insurrections or violent protests , &quot; Liberal legal expert Roger Guevara MENA told the local newspaper La Tribuna . 
since losing the 1990 elections to former President Violeta Chamorro , the Sandinistas have also lost their once-complete control of the army and police , which were created following the 1979 revolution as armed branches of the Sandinista party . 
but despite the setbacks , the Sandinistas , who governed Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990 with Cuban and Soviet backing , clearly remained the second political force in Nicaragua . 
they emerged from the Oct . 20 elections the only opposition force to Aleman &apos;s Liberals in Nicaragua , political analyst Carlos Fernando Chamorro said . 
they won 38 percent of the vote in the elections , hold 36 of the 93 seats in Nicaragua &apos;s National Assembly and control 51 city councils . 
but the revolutionary mythology surrounding the Sandinista leaders has clearly frayed . 
bloodied by back-to-back defeats in presidential elections , analysts say the Sandinistas must change their political leadership -- including Ortega -- to survive . 
the same ageing group of guerrilla commanders who toppled former dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979 still run the Sandinistas , and they have not been able to adapt to the new global environment , Rene Vargas said . 
&quot; The Sandinista Front needs new faces in its leadership . 
if there is not a deep renovation in its political directorate , the tendency for the Sandinistas will be to continue losing its political space , &quot; he said .
