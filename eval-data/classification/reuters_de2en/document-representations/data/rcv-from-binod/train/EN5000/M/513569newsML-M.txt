U.S. West Coast crude prices were flat with steady benchmarket grade midday Wednesday , though refiners expected discounts to fall as they offered South American grades to one another , they said . 
West Coast spot crude traders focused on Oriente crude , an Ecuadorian grade , which Texaco offered for late April delivery at $ 1.35 to $ 1.40 a barrel under Alaska North Slope ( ANS ) crude , traders said . 
the shipment holds 360,000 barrels . 
&quot; We &apos;re not the lowest offer out there , &quot; a trader said , noting that Glencore trading house offered at $ 1.50 under ANS . 
the April cargo precedes two full cargoes due in May . 
Texaco &apos;s offer follows its purchase of 400,000 barrels of ANS on Friday , which displaced the South American cargo . 
the price , $ 1.32 off May WTI , is 0.27-cent widening from the last deal . 
outright prices stood at $ 18.18 / 18.38 a barrel , flat with Tuesday . 
line 63 and California heavy crude markets remained well- supplied , with no deals reported Monday or Tuesday .
