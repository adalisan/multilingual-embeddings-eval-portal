India on Friday closely monitored what it called an &quot; extremely fluid situation &quot; in Afghanistan and stepped up security at residences maintained in New Delhi by the families of two former Afghan presidents . 
one of the ex-presidents , Najibullah , and his brother were executed by the Taleban militia after its forces swept into the ruined Afghan capital , Kabul , overnight and proclaimed the complete enforcement of Islam in the war-wracked country . 
the other former president , Babrak Karmal , was believed to be in Moscow . 
Afghanistan &apos;s ambassador to India , Masood Khalili , told a news conference in New Delhi on Friday that the current president , Burhanuddin Rabbani , and members of his government were about 25 km ( 15 miles ) north of Kabul . 
he said Rabbani &apos;s government still controlled 13 of Afghanistan &apos;s 31 provinces . 
Kabul &apos;s dramatic overnight collapse was the result of a considered decision by the Rabbani government not to endanger the lives of the city &apos;s 1.5 million civilian population , the ambassador added . 
&quot; Now they will decide how and when they should launch or enforce their military strategy against Taleban , &quot; Khalili said . 
Najibullah &apos;s widow , meanwhile , was seen being driven off at speed in a bullet-proof car from her New Delhi residence to an undisclosed destination , apparently in the direction of Delhi &apos;s airport . 
Indian troops had surrounded the sprawling Najibullah house in the exclusive Asian Games Village and some soldiers took up positions on rooftops near the Najibullah complex . 
&quot; We heard the news on television , it &apos;s shocking , &quot; Roman Baryalai , a nephew of Babrak Karmal , said in New Delhi of the Taleban takeover . 
he said he had not heard from his uncle , who was in Moscow . 
an unknown number of wounded soldiers loyal to President Rabbani were being treated in several private hospitals in the Indian capital . 
Khalili said he was confident the government would push the Taleban from Kabul with forces posted on the heights to the north and northwest of the city . 
government forces were still as close as seven km ( four miles ) from the capital , he said . 
meanwhile , the Indian government said it had evacuated its diplomats from Kabul just hours before the city fell to the Talebin militia . 
foreign Secretary Salman Haider told a news conference that 11 Indian officials left on the last flight from Bagram military airbase near Kabul on Thursday night . 
&quot; We are watching an extremely fluid situation which is very unclear , &quot; Haider added . 
India joined President Rabbani in accusing Pakistan , which lies between India and Afghanistan , of interfering in Afghanistan &apos;s internal affairs . 
Ambassador Khalili , at his news conference in New Delhi , accused the Islamic militia of seeking a military rather than a political solution . 
Pakistan says it has a neutral position on the civil war has apparently signalled its recognition of the new Taleban administration set up in Kabul .
