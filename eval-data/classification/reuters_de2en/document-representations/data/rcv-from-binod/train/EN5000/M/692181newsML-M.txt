Colombia cut its internal coffee price by another 0.55 percent Friday , setting it at 378,375 pesos per 125-kg load , the National Coffee Growers &apos; Federation said . 
it was the sixth price cut since Jan . 31 , when a new sliding- scale formula was introduced to adjust prices paid to growers on a weekly basis and allow them to better track world market prices . 
the latest drop in the internal price follows last week &apos;s 3.27 percent cut and a steep 11.6 percent cut the week before that . 
a federation spokesman said it was based on Friday &apos;s low $ 2.23 per pound trading price for Colombian coffee in New York .
