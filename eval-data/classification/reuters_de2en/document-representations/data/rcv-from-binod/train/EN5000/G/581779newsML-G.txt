diplomats and observers say a presidential race between incumbent Algirdas Brazauskas and Parliamentary Chairman Vytautas Landsbergis would be a political battle royale but would mean little more . 
&quot; It is the two great men of Lithuania &apos;s post-independence history coming to the final tussle , &quot; said one diplomat . 
the two are long-time political rivals , dating back to Lithuania &apos;s struggle for independence , when Brazauskas headed Lithuania &apos;s Communist Party and Landsbergis led the independence movement . 
Landsbergis announced Saturday that he will run as a candidate for Lithuania &apos;s top office in the December election , but Brazauskas , who remains popular with voters , has not said whether he plans to seek a second term as head of state . 
&quot; Brazauskas is a sly old fox , but he has his supporters and those who dislike him , and so does Landsbergis , &quot; the diplomat added . 
despite their conflicting pasts and personalities , few observers see any outstanding policy differences between the two , especially in foreign policy . 
both men are staunch supporters of Lithuania &apos;s drive to join NATO and the European Union . 
&quot; I doubt if it makes any bit of difference ( who wins the election ) , &quot; the diplomat said . 
personality is a bigger factor , diplomats say , noting that the colourful and eccentric Landsbergis may be the more eloquent spokesman for Lithuania &apos;s interests . 
in a recent New York Times op-ed , conservative American pundit William Safire called Landsbergis &quot; a soft-spoken music teacher who stood up to Mikhail Gorbachev &apos;s bully boys in 1990 to assert his nation &apos;s independence . 
but the parliamentary chairman is also known for a grating style that is less than diplomatic . 
&quot; Landsbergis is the more elegant , but he does have the capacity to irritate , &quot; the diplomat said . 
&quot; He is very direct but he has his country &apos;s interests in mind , &quot; said another diplomat . 
&quot; Sometimes you have to be that way to get your country &apos;s interests heard . 
although famous in the West for helping , as Safire says , &quot; to pry apart the Soviet empire , &quot; Landsbergis &apos; heroic exploits do not necessarily translate into political capital at home . 
&quot; There is quite a big difference between Lithuanians &apos; opinion and the West &apos;s , &quot; said Violeta Gaizauskaite , a political journalist at Lithuanian daily Lietuvos Rytas . 
&quot; Landsbergis is not so popular in Lithuania as in Western countries , &quot; Gaizauskaite said . 
Landsbergis , with his esoteric manner of speaking , often seems out of touch with the concerns of ordinary voters , many of whom are struggling to make ends meet in the harsh environment of a transition economy . 
Brazauskas , who made his own contribution to the independence struggle by splitting the Lithuanian Communist Party from Moscow &apos;s rule , is also respected . 
and when it comes to campaigning , he has few , if any , equals in Lithuania . 
he is known for his down-to-earth , folksy style . 
&quot; It seems he is most popular not as president but as a man , &quot; Grazauskaite said .
