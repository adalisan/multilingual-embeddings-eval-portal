France trumpeted its restrictive drug policies on Tuesday and renewed appeals to the Netherlands to tighten liberal narcotics laws . 
Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre said French arrests of drug dealers rose eight percent in 1996 and that police seized 17 percent more ecstasy and 20 percent more heroin than in 1995 . 
he said that deaths from drug overdoses fell 20 percent . 
&quot; We intend to continue &quot; , Debre told parliament . 
he added that a transfer of some police to anti-narcotics duty should help the crackdown . 
without naming the Netherlands , Debre said &quot; we have taken an extremely firm position regarding certain of our ( European Union ) partners and we hope that this partner will progressively adopt our views . 
France has often criticised the Netherlands , where modest amounts of soft drugs are sold at so-called &quot; coffee shops &quot; . 
Paris has held up fully opening its borders under a seven-nation EU pact , partly by arguing that Dutch drug laws promote smuggling . 
Debre ruled out any relaxation in French laws . 
&quot; I have to assure you that there &apos;s no question of us legalising , in any way , sale and consumption of toxic substances , &quot; he said . 
according to Dutch statistics , the Netherlands has 1.6 drug addicts per 1,000 head of population , well below about 2.5 per 1,000 in France .
