after rallying briefly on mixed U.S. jobs data on Friday , Belgian shares will remain vulnerable to more U.S. data in the next few weeks , especially as the Federal Reserve FOMC meeting on May 20 nears , dealers said . 
&quot; We &apos;re going from day to day as far as the U.S. is concerned , &quot; one analyst said . 
meanwhile the prospect of dividend payouts continues to provide support , especially for high yielding stocks . 
the Bel-20 index .BFX finished 8.32 points or 0.37 percent higher at 2,253.83 after hitting a new high of 2,257.40 , beating the previous session &apos;s record , following the U.S. jobs figures . 
shares were first enthused by news of a lower-than-expected rise in April pay-rolls , before coming off the highs as they digested a fall in the unemployment rate to 4.9 percent from 5.2 percent . 
lower yields in the Belgian bond market and a positive start to Wall Street in the afternoon provided underlying support , though this was countered by a continued weaker trend in the franc / dollar . 
&quot; There &apos;s been interest in those shares going ex-dividend ( like ) holdings and banks - their dividends are relatively high compared to the rest , &quot; the analyst added . 
steel cord and wire maker Bekaert , which one analyst said was suffering from a downgrade by an international broker , fell 2.45 percent to 20,900 francs . 
dealers noted however wide bid and ask spreads were exaggerating many prices on Friday when a modest 2.2 billion francs worth of Belgian shares was traded altogether after some players decided to take another day off following Thursday &apos;s May Day holiday ,
