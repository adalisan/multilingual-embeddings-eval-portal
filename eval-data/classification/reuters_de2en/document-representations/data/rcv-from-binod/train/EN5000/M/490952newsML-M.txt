gas oil trade in Singapore is now more focused on May which reflected the backwardated market with two deals done at lower levels , traders said on Monday . 
but the market continued to find support from a Singapore trader who bought another 450,000 barrels , bringing his total to over eight million barrels since early May . 
the trader bought two cargoes for May 3-7 lifting from a European major at $ 26.40 per barrel , free-on-board ( fob ) basis , 30 cents below its purchase on Friday for end-April / early May cargoes . 
but the trader bought a cargo for April 22-26 lifting from the major at $ 26.90 , unchanged from Friday . 
traders said another cargo was heard bought by the same local trader from a Dutch trader at $ 27.25 for April 25-29 lifting fob , but traders discounted this deal as beyond the current market level for that period . 
traders said the lower deals reflected a weakening market , with as many as nine sellers seen in the market . 
swaps shaved off 30-50 cents to be last quoted at $ 26.25 / $ 26.30 per barrel for May , while April was quoted at $ 25.00 / $ 25.10 after falling to a low of $ 24.95 . 
jet fuel also saw abundant offers with four sellers seen offering at low levels . 
fob cargoes were offered around $ 25.10 per barrel , while a cost-and-freight cargo was seen at $ 25.00 , about $ 1.40 below Friday &apos;s offer . 
India also failed to provide much support to the weak jet market with its purchase of two cargoes in its tender for May , despite market expectations of three cargoes . 
the cargoes were sold by bb Energy and Shell at $ 34.84 per tonne above the high of Mediterranean quotes , c-and-f Indian east coast .
