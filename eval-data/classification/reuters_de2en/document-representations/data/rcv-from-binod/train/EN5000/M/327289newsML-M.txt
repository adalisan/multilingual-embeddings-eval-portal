an investor placed a big bet on a market correction by June with a put bear spread in S &amp; P 500 stock index options on Thursday . 
the SPX June 725 put and the June 775 put each traded 14,770 contracts . 
the 725s went out mostly at 10-5 / 8 and the 775s went out mostly at 22 . 
&quot; They did a June 775-725 put bear spread for 10 points , &quot; said Michael Schwartz , managing director at Oppenheimer &amp; Co . &quot; The profit potential if the market is at 725 or lower ( at expiration ) is 40 points . 
the profit would be the difference between the 50-point spread of the options and the net cost to do the trade . 
&quot; It looks like a big speculation on a correction or just a hedge fund hedging a large portfolio , &quot; Schwartz said . 
he said the trade , done throughout the day in small blocks , was likely driven by an institutional investor because SPX options are geared toward insitutions , with European-style expirations . 
options with European-style expirations can only be exercised on the expiration day . 
American-style options can be exercised at any time up to the expiration . 
in afternoon trading , the underlying SPX was up 1.49 poitns at 787.72 , off its session high of 794.67 , which was a record intraday peak . 
the index had reached five-straight record closing highs through Wednesday , when it finished at 786.23 , shrugging off a drubbing in blue chip International Business machines Corp 
the SPX June 725 put had open interest of 36,278 through Wednesday and the 775 put had open interest of 4,450 . 
most other SPX options were not particularly active , with few trading more than 3,000 contracts . 
in the S &amp; P 100 index .OEX , put options continued to be the option of choice , with put volume outpacing call volume by 55,501 to 41,846 . 
the OEX was up 2.37 at 773.55 after hitting an all-time intraday high at 779.85 . 
the heaviest OEX volume was in the February 790 call , which traded nearly 5,200 contracts , and the February 775 put , which traded about 5,040 . 
other actives included the February 700 put , the February 760 put , the Febraury 775 call ADN the February 780 call .
