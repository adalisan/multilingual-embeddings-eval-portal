Croatia &apos;s ruling nationalist party is counting on the charisma of President Franjo Tudjman and opposition disunity to stave off big losses in coming regional elections , analysts say . 
the April 13 vote for county and municipal bodies will be the first in independent Croatia held beyond the shadow of war and on all of its sovereign territory , including a separatist Serb enclave due to be &quot; reintegrated &quot; under central rule soon . 
it will show whether Tudjman , 74 , the helmsman of Croatian statehood , can help his unpopular party ( HDZ ) to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat by the sheer force of his personality . 
Tudjman would like to set the stage for his bid to be re-elected in presidential elections set for this summer . 
the HDZ ( Croatian Democratic Union ) hopes to profit from the Croats &apos; traditional preference for a strong leader , heightened by sympathy for Tudjman over his recent bout of cancer which has visibly aged him but not sapped his trademark vigour in public . 
if things go wrong for the HDZ on April 13 , the result will test the authoritarian Tudjman &apos;s readiness to admit defeat and avoid protests like those in Serbia that forced authorities to reinstate opposition victories in annulled municipal elections . 
two years ago , he vetoed an opposition bloc victory in Zagreb municipal voting , citing &quot; national security &quot; . 
this enabled him to retain HDZ control over the region which has a quarter of Croatia &apos;s population and powerful levers of the economy . 
Tudjman rejected several opposition candidates for Zagreb mayor before naming his own to rule provisionally . 
the opposition coalition fell apart after personality squabbles and no street protests occurred , unlike in Serbia . 
but an attempt by Tudjman-backed HDZ rightists to shut down popular independent Radio 101 last November triggered huge protest rallies in Zagreb and the government backed off . 
diplomats believe the sobering experience of the Radio 101 outcry , the example Serbian protesters set for politically disaffected Croats and Croatia &apos;s recent admission to the Council of Europe , will make it harder for Tudjman to ignore election setbacks this time . 
Croatian rulers have probably learned lessons from the fiasco of cancelled election results in Serbia , &quot; said one diplomat . 
&quot; Croatia certainly doesn &apos;t want to be labelled by the Western press as being no better than Serbia . 
other commentators believe Tudjman could use his veto to delay opposition takeovers in selected districts until summer and then engineer renewed HDZ-led administrations without serious protest , possibly by enticing rivals into coalitions . 
&quot; Tudjman , unlike ( Serbian President Slobodan ) Milosevic , would have some legal tools for his acts . 
a protracted process would not irritate people like outright fraud would , as happened in Serbia , &quot; said analyst Davor Gjenero . 
&quot; And the opposition would not dare call protesters out on the streets during the tourist season , which is so vital for the Croatian economy , &quot; he said . 
Croats are also less inclined than Serbs to protest action because they fear instability after a ruinous war and favour consensus politics . 
this might include HDZ coalitions with opposition parties in the case of close election results leaving Tudjman &apos;s party , by far the country &apos;s biggest , in the driver &apos;s seat . 
most recent polls show the HDZ &apos;s approval rating down to between 20 and 35 percent in major towns with rival coalitions of two to three parties running close or slightly ahead . 
Tudjman told a Western interviewer recently he would respect any election result , but added with a chuckle , &quot; The HDZ cannot possibly lose &quot; . 
Tudjman will top all electoral slates of his Croatian Democratic Union ( HDZ ) although he will not be a candidate for any office , betraying the fear of party strategists that it cannot win without his omnipresence . 
it has serious electoral appeal problems . 
so it had to put Tudjman atop all the lists . 
he is still the main card , the only one still able to pull the faithful vote in , &quot; said a senior Western diplomat . 
popular resentment has grown over perceived economic mismanagement and profiteering by an HDZ elite while most Croats struggle on an average monthly wage of $ 350 in a country as expensive as affluent Germany or France . 
yet Croatian opposition parties are an unimaginative bunch with bickering , colourless leaders who have had trouble forming and sticking to coalitions that would unseat the HDZ . 
but analysts wonder whether they they can beat the HDZ decisively without an alliance with the Social Democrats , who have been spurned for their communist past although they poll up to 20 percent in some districts , including the capital . 
a novel aspect of the next vote will be the participation of former rebel Serbs in Croatian politics for the first time . 
tens of thousands of Serbs will be eligible to vote in Eastern Slavonia , Croatia &apos;s last surviving breakaway enclave now under United Nations transitional administration . 
but Western monitors believe Serb parties will win only a few of 30 municipalities because Croats formed a majority before fleeing in the 1991 war against Serbs , and will now vote en masse , largely for the HDZ . 
a significant number of adult Serbs , by contrast , may flee reintegration to nearby Serbia rather than vote .
