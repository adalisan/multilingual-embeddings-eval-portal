REX Chapman set a playoff record with nine three-pointers and scored 42 points Friday as the Phoenix suns stunned the defending Western Conference champion SuperSonics 106-101 in the opener of their best-of-five playoff series . 
Chapman , who had scored 27 points in three career postseason games , shot down the SuperSonics with the best long-range performance in playoff history . 
&quot; Thank goodness Rex Chapman was on fire tonight , &quot; said suns coach Danny Ainge . 
&quot; He carried us . 
he was unconscious . 
Chapman was 9-of-17 from behind the arc , breaking the record of eight three-pointers set by former Sun Dan Majerle against Seattle on June 1 , 1993 . 
&quot; I guess it is like being in a zone , &quot; said Chapman . 
&quot; But I really didn &apos;t feel that way in the second half . 
I was just trying to make it to the end of the game . 
Chapman made four three-pointers and scored 19 points in the second quarter , giving Phoenix a 51-44 halftime lead . 
he made two more clutch three-pointers in the final three minutes of the game to key a decisive 11-2 surge . 
&quot; That &apos;s what the playoffs are about , great moments like that , &quot; suns guard Kevin Johnson said . 
&quot; No matter what happens , Rex will go down as having one of the greatest moments in playoff history . 
he put on a show . 
Gary Payton had 23 points and nine assists and Shawn Kemp added 19 points and 15 rebounds for Seattle , which shot 50 percent from three-point range , missed just two free throws and held a 45-33 rebounding advantage -- and still lost . 
in Los Angeles , Shaquille O &apos;Neal put on his own offensive explosion , overpowering single coverage to score 46 points in leading the Lakers to a 95-77 win over the Portland Trail Blazers in the opener of their Western Conference series . 
o &apos;Neal was 17-of-27 from the field and a surprising 12-of-18 from the line for his highest-scoring game as a Laker . 
he also had 11 rebounds and continually took advantage of Portland centres Arvydas Sabonis and Chris Dudley . 
Elden Campbell added 20 points for the Lakers , who allowed Portland just one basket in the final 4 1 / 2 minutes . 
Sabonis and Rasheed Wallace scored 18 points apiece for the Trail Blazers , who beat the Lakers three out of four times in the regular season . 
Portland shot just 41 percent ( 30-of-73 ) from the field . 
in Chicago , Michael Jordan and Steve Kerr scored 11 points each in the fourth quarter as the defending NBA champion Chicago bulls held off the Washington bullets 98-86 in the opener of their Eastern Conference first-round series . 
forwards Dennis Rodman and Toni Kukoc were back from injuries to put the bulls at full strength . 
Jordan had 29 points , eight rebounds and eight assists and slowed down lightning-quick point guard Rod Strickland in the second half . 
Scottie Pippen added 16 points and 10 rebounds for the bulls , who never trailed after the first 20 seconds . 
&quot; Defense , I feel , won the game for us , &quot; said Jordan , who shot 12-of-25 from the field . 
&quot; I think we were all a little bit tentative tonight , &quot; Pippen said . 
&quot; Having Toni and Dennis back in the lineup was great but we certainly didn &apos;t have our usual chemistry going , at least not early in the game . 
Chicago native Juwan Howard had 21 points and Strickland added 19 points , 10 rebounds and eight assists for the bullets , who were making their first playoff appearance in nine years . 
All-Star forward Chris Webber scored just eight points before fouling out . 
Rodman sported gold hair and a brace on his sprained left knee . 
he grabbed nine rebounds before he was ejected for arguing in the fourth quarter . 
Kukoc , returning from a torn tendon in his foot , scored seven points on 1-of-10 shooting . 
in Atlanta , Dikembe Mutombo had 26 points and 15 rebounds and the Atlanta hawks shut down the Detroit pistons in the second half for an 89-75 victory in the opener of their Eastern Conference playoff series . 
the 7-2 ( 2.18 m ) Mutombo , who received his Defensive Player of the Year trophy before the game , anchored a defence that held the pistons to 32 points in the second half . 
Mutombo also made a huge impact on offence as he came within one point of his season high . 
&quot; Dikembe was very good in the low post , &quot; hawks coach Lenny Wilkens said . 
&quot; Coming in , we thought he should be more of an offensive threat than in past years . 
Dikembe &apos;s game has evolved offensively , so we kept going to him . 
Christian Laettner scored 18 points for the hawks . 
grant Hill had 20 points , 14 rebounds and seven assists for the pistons , who won three of four games from Atlanta during the season . 
&quot; They just have bigger bodies , &quot; pistons coach Doug Collins said . 
&quot; Unfortunately for our team , I have to make Grant Hill work so hard for us and he got tired . 
their physical size wore us down .
