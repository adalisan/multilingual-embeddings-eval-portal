European bourses started the week with steep losses on Monday , badly rattled by Wall Street &apos;s two percent drop on Friday caused by of fears of higher U.S. interest rates . 
on currency markets , the dollar was stronger against the mark and yen as traders pondered whether Friday &apos;s rout was the start of trend weakness or just a correction . 
sterling was also looking more robust . 
London , Frankfurt and Paris stocks all tumbled by about one percent at the opening before recovering somewhat . 
Europe &apos;s performance was virtually a rerun of the poor showing on Friday . 
London investors were unsettled by New York , which ended 156.78 points off at 8,031.22 on Friday . 
things were helped a little by inflation figures on Monday which were at the low end of forecasts but the mood remained edgy . 
&quot; The future of the market hangs on whether the interest rate cycle has indeed peaked and we &apos;ll have evidence of that all through the week , &quot; said a dealer . 
&quot; The market &apos;s nervous about whether it &apos;s peaked and despite the drop on Friday , the FTSE ( 100 ) was up about 130 points on the week so thing &apos;s look rather vulnerable , &quot; said another dealer . 
this was well below the psychologically important 5,000-point barrier it breached last week for the first time , leaving some investors worried that the bull run had gone too far , too fast . 
in Frankfurt , stocks opened down about one percent but recovered some ground by mid-morning . 
&quot; The sell-off this morning was on the back of Wall Street and the dollar , but it has been squeezing back since that . 
not exactly a huge correction , &quot; a Frankfurt broker said . 
&quot; People were keeping an eye on the Bund ( government bonds ) this morning and the fact that it is positive has helped to stabilise things in the equity market . 
but generally this is real Monday morning stuff , volumes are thin and you have traders selling off from Friday , &quot; he said . 
on the downside , shares in pharmaceuticals group Altana AG were the biggest losers . 
Altana was down 13 marks , or 7.98 percent , at 150 marks . 
dealers said there was speculation in the market about problems over further development of its Pantoprazol product , but no-one at Altana was available for comment . 
Paris too clawed back some of its early losses but was still down 0.5 percent . 
&quot; It &apos;s relatively calm , it &apos;s not a huge sell-off , &quot; equity salesman John Fordyce at Oddo said . 
blue chips led the declines , including Alcatel Alsthom , down 1.52 percent , with 69 million francs in trades and Elf-Aquitaine down 1.32 percent . 
in currency markets , the dollar was at 1.8557 marks and 115.70 yen , up a pfennig and half a yen on the levels seen on Friday after it plunged four pfennigs and over four yen . 
but a sustained recovery might be difficult , dealers said . 
&quot; nervousness will continue even though at this stage people are more inclined to be buyers than sellers , &quot; said Chris Furness , foreign exchange strategist at 4Cast Ltd in London . 
Furness said the market was a directionless , with no U.S. data scheduled for Monday and as traders awaited the Bundesbank &apos;s repo announcement on Tuesday . 
&quot; Nobody is quite prepared to put their foot into the water yet , &quot; he said . 
the sharp decline of the dollar last week was in part triggered by simmering speculation that the Bundesbank might nudge the repurchase rate higher from 3.00 percent at Tuesday &apos;s repo tender . 
the sell-off accelerated late in Europe on Friday after Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing was quoted in a newspaper as saying German price developments were moving in the wrong direction in all areas , including consumer prices . 
the British pound rebounded three pfennigs to 2.9470 marks and was up four cents to $ 1.5889 in early trade from Friday &apos;s dramatic falls . 
sterling has been badly hit by official signals that British interest rates had peaked for the time being . 
but chartists said an extension to the recovery faces tough initial resistance at 2.95 marks and $ 1.59 . 
&quot; Sterling is the only one of the major crosses which has seen a trend reversal , &quot; said Nico Bakker , technical analyst at ABN-AMRO in Amsterdam . 
the dollar was quoted around 1.8557 marks and 115.70 yen , compared with 1.8453 and 115.12 in late trading on Thursday . 
gold was at $ 324.85 an ounce in the morning , down from Friday &apos;s London close of $ 325.05 . 
silver was steady at $ 4.41 .
