silver prices could rise as high as $ 6.00 an ounce by late 1997 as a continued deficit between supply and demand draws down above-ground silver inventories to critically low levels , New York-based industry consultant CPM Group said Thursday . 
&quot; The amount of bullion available to the market has declined sharply since the end of 1989 and is estimated to be at the lowest levels in more than 46 years , &quot; CPM Group managing director Jeffrey Christian told analysts at a briefing at the publication of the Group &apos;s 1997 silver survey . 
COMEX nearby active March silver futures were down 2.5 cents at $ 5.175 an ounce early Tuesday . 
last year , spot silver tumbled from a high of $ 5.27 on Aug 26 to a 19-month low of $ 4.66 on Nov 27 . 
since 1989 , the amount of silver used by fabricators in the manufacture of jewelry , silverplate , photographic film and paper has exceeded the supply of silver refined from mine production and old scrap resulting in a large drawdown in the above-ground world silver inventories built up in the 1980s . 
&quot; However , more than 1.0 billion ounces have been used of the 1.5 billion ounces of silver bullion inventories that are estimated to have existed at the beginning of 1990 , &quot; CPM group said in its report . 
CPM Group estimates that at the end of 1996 , around 452.8 million ounces of silver existed worldwide in reported and unreported bullion inventories . 
inventories were sufficient to cover 62.9 percent of 1996 &apos;s total fabrication demand or 7.6 months of demand at 1996 &apos;s rate of silver use . 
&quot; Given our current projections for the silver market in 1997 , bullion stocks could fall 36 PCT to 289.6 million ounces by the end of 1997 , equal to 4.7 months of fabrication demand , &quot; the report stated . 
reported inventories have fallen by 162.4 million ounces from a peak of 350.6 million in September 1992 to 188.2 million at year-end 1996 ( before adding in the previously unreported inventories at Wilmington Trust Company in Delaware ) , the report said . 
but unreported inventories are estimated to have dropped much more dramatically , by perhaps 900 million ounces . 
&quot; Even those that have played silver heavily from the short side in the last 15 months are aware that they are going to have to play it from the long side in the next few years , &quot; Christian told analysts . 
after the inclusion of Wilmington Trust stocks , registered inventories in COMEX vaults totaled 203.45 million ounces on Jan 1 , but by Jan 31 silver in COMEX vaults had declined to 194.85 million ounces .
