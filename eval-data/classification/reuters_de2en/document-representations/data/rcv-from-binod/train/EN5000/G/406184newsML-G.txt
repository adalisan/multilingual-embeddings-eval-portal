Austria on Thursday unveiled a package aimed at tightening immigration laws and giving preference to Austrians in the job market . 
the coalition government of Social Democrats and the conservative People &apos;s Party faces growing public concern over mounting unemployment . 
in January , unemployment hit a post-World War Two record of 4.1 percent at 300,000 people . 
from now on no new immigrants would be allowed into Austria except those with key skills that are not available in the country , Interior Minister Karl Schloegl told a news conference . 
foreign families would only be allowed to join relatives who had been living in Austria for a long time , he added , without specifying how long . 
&quot; Some 60,000 foreigners who live here legally but have no job permits will get access step by step to the job market . 
but foreigners will only be employed when no Austrians can be found to fill the vacancies , &quot; said Schloegl . 
far-right Freedom Party leader Joerg Haider , who has pressed for years for curbs on immigration , described the proposals as &quot; misleading packaging &quot; . 
Haider demands an immediate halt to all immigration and the forced repatriation of unemployed foreigners who have lived in the country for less than three years . 
State benefit to jobless foreigners costs Austria 780 million schillings ( $ 65 million ) annually , he claims . 
Haider told a news conference on Thursday that foreigners should be sent home with the help of state loans which they would then have to repay .
