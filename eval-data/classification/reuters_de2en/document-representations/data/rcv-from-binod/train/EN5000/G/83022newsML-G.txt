bookmakers were left running for cover on Saturday as Frankie Dettori rode seven winners from seven rides and made two punters half-millionaires . 
on one of the most astonishing days in British racing history , the cumulative odds on Dettori &apos;s winners amounted to 25,095-1 , sending shudders down the oddsmakers &apos; spines . 
one lucky backer in northern England staked just over 60 pounds ( $ 93 ) in a special combination bet with bookmakers William Hill on all Dettori &apos;s mounts and ended the day over 500,000 pounds ( $ 780,600 ) richer . 
another punter won a similar amount with a Ladbrokes shop in London after staking an each way accumulator costing 10 pounds ( $ 15.6 ) . 
William Hill spokesman David Hood said : &quot; It is the worse day in bookmaking history . 
our managers will be settling bets until midnight . 
&quot; The fifth winner was expensive , the sixth dismal and after the seventh it was time to put the lights out . 
another Hill spokesman , Graham Sharpe , echoed : &quot; Frankie &apos;s seven winners have made this the blackest day in British bookmaking history . 
it &apos;s a disaster . 
we don &apos;t expect any sympathy but it &apos;s the worst day &apos;s business we &apos;ve done since Lester Piggott was in his heyday and winning the Derby every year . 
&quot; It will cost us millions . 
we will tot up the damage when everybody &apos;s back at work . 
Dettori &apos;s last three winners were all favourites , forced down to much shorter prices than forecast by the sheer weight of money running up from earlier bets , such as doubles and trebles . 
Dettori joked with racegoers after his historic seventh win : &quot; I &apos;m just warming up , is there any more racing ? 
this is everybody &apos;s dream . 
God was on my side . 
go and collect your money . 
thousands stayed behind to salute Dettori &apos;s feat , which included four winners for the Godolphin team trained by Saeed bin Suroor . 
he threw his goggles into the crowd and then sprayed onlookers with the champagne . 
Mike Dillon of bookmakers Ladbrokes said : &quot; When the most popular jockey riding wins all the races , you lose . 
but I have to say this is tremendous day for the racing industry . 
the two-day Ascot festival ends on Sunday with another seven-race card . 
Dettori has mounts in each and the first three are favourites . 
on such sparkling form he might even fancy a tilt at a record set in August 1933 by Sir Gordon Richards who rode 12 winners in succession . 
the first came in the last race at Nottingham , followed by all six the next day at Chepstow and the first five the next day at the same track . 
another Ladbrokes spokesman , Ian Wassell , said : &quot; Tomorrow is another day to try to get some of our money back . 
it &apos;s the Ascot festival again . 
he &apos;s in all seven again tomorrow and we hope he won &apos;t repeat the dose ! 
&quot; I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll have floods of people looking to do the same bet again tomorrow .
