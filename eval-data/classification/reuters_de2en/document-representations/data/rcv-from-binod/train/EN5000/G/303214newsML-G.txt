Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday said he was &quot; shocked &quot; at the killings by the Burundi army over the weekend and called on the country to prevent further massacres . 
soldiers from Burundi &apos;s Tutsi-dominated army shot dead 126 Burundian Hutu refugees who had been expelled from Tanzania and tried to escape from a detention centre in Burundi on Saturday , an army spokesman said . 
he said seven soldiers had been arrested . 
Annan , in a statement , said that Burundi &apos;s U.N. ambassador had been called in to convey the world body &apos;s concern to the country &apos;s leaders , headed by Maj. Pierre Buyoya , who came to power last summer in an army coup . 
Annan said that while he welcomed the fact that Burundi &apos;s authorities seemed to have taken action against some of the perpetrators he &quot; strongly urges the authorities to ensure that the rule of law is scrupulously followed to prevent further masacres by the army . 
Annan said that the latest tragedy underscored the need for an immediate ceasefire followed by negotiations among all parties &quot; to put an end to this abhorent cycle of violence whose first victims are the innocent civilian populations .
