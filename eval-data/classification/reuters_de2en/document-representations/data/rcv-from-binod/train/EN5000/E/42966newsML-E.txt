the Canadian province of British Columbia said Tuesday it recorded a budget deficit of C $ 463 million in the first fiscal quarter to June 30 . 
that compared to a C $ 228 million deficit in the same period a year ago . 
provincial Finance Minister Andrew Petter said the first-quarter deficit was C $ 149 million higher than internal government forecasts . 
Petter said the government planned to cut C $ 750 million in spending over the next 18 months . 
Petter said the cuts would come from streamlining and efficiency moves . 
a ministry spokesman attributed the deficit surprise to lower than expected revenue from forest industry fees and poor forecasting . 
he said the government was overhauling its forecasting methods . 
the province has been under attack over its finances . 
it said in July it had a C $ 235 million deficit in the fiscal year to March 31 rather than a C $ 16 million surplus ( corrects to insert word &quot; surplus &quot; ) as previously forecast . 
it blamed that performance on a shortfall in forestry fees as well . 
opposition politicians have accused the government of withholding the deficit news until after a May provincial election in which the New Democratic Party held on to power by a slim margin . 
the government stuck to that forecast Tuesday but Petter said achieving it was predicated on economic growth of at least two percent as well as the spending cuts . 
Petter said he could not guarantee it would achieved . 
the province said growth forecasts ranged from one to 2.6 percent . 
if economic growth came at the low end of forecasts the province would face a &quot; challenge &quot; in achieving its target , Petter said . 
the province said forest revenues were C $ 90 million below budget in the first quarter in part because of lower than expected lumber and pulp prices .
