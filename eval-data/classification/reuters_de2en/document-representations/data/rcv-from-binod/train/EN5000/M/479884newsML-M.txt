the Israeli shekel &apos;s representative rate was fixed higher against the dollar on Tuesday after the U.S. currency declined on overseas markets , dealers said . 
the central bank bought dollars to support the foreign exchange rate . 
&quot; The shekel rose against the dollar following the decline of the dollar abroad after sharp falls in U.S. markets , &quot; said Guy Levi at Bank Leumi . 
&quot; The dollar &apos;s decline pushed the basket below the lower edge of the trading band and the Bank of Israel had to intervene in the market , buying dollars , on a relatively high scale , &quot; Levi said . 
the central bank has been intervening regularly in the market to defend the basket , which has been trading at the bottom end of its band for two months . 
&quot; Volume was high after a four-day Easter break , &quot; Levi added . 
the representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.3570 shekels against 3.3610 on Thursday . 
the basket , composed of the dollar , mark , pound sterling , French franc and yen , was fixed at 3.6617 shekels against 3.6587 on Thursday .
