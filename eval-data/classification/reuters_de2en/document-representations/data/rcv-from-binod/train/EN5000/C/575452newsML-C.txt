British food and drinks group Grand Metropolitan plc , set to merge with Guinness plc , said on Monday its first-half , pre-tax profits rose 3.5 percent to 471 million pounds ( $ 765.6 million ) before charges . 
grand Metropolitan said the pound &apos;s strength reduced its first-half operating profit by about 30 million pounds , while its pre-tax , pre-exceptionals profit was cut by some 28 million pounds . 
however , this impact was mitigated by a 12 million pound gain on hedging activities related to its U.S. earnings , the company said . 
the company raised its interim dividend by 6.8 percent to 6.25 pence per share . 
&quot; The strength of our food and drinks brands and the clear focus of our management on investing where we can earn good returns , give us confidence that we will continue to make progress , &quot; said chairman George Bull in a statement . 
grand Met said its Burger King fast food restaurants had a first-half operating profit of 69 million pounds , up 4.0 percent in local currency terms . 
the company said Burger King &apos;s U.S. market share rose in the first half , with same-store sales rising 2.5 percent , although that trend slowed in the second quarter . 
burger King &apos;s European businesses posted a first-half operating loss , mainly due to closure costs of 20 stores in Britain and five in Germany . 
&quot; The underlying trading performance therefore improved significantly on the second half of last year , &quot; the company said , adding that the outlook for Burger King worldwide was good . 
among its other operations , Grand Met said Pillsbury &apos;s reported operating profit rose five percent to 248 million pounds -- representing 10 percent local currency growth -- boosted by improved sales mix and margins in the U.S. 
operating profits for Grand Met &apos;s IDV drinks arm rose 5.0 percent in local currency , but its reported profit slipped 1.0 percent to 208 million pounds due to sterling &apos;s strength .
