current fixed-term sanctions against athletes who fail dope tests should be scrapped in favour of shorter bans , International Olympic Commission ( IOC ) medical chief Prince Alexandre de Merode said on Wednesday . 
they will always be questioned by the law courts , &quot; De Merode told a news conference after a meeting of anti-doping experts . 
&quot; What is the point of an inapplicable sanction ? 
&quot; We have also had to adapt to the social evolution in sports . 
as a result , I think we will try to find a solution that is adequate for today &apos;s realities ... Who does not evolve , dies . 
the International amateur Athletic Federation ( IAAF ) has mandatory four-year bans for the most serious doping offences . 
last year , worried by rising legal costs , the IAAF council tried to force a cut in its mandatory bans to two years at its congress but failed after an emotional debate . 
however some countries such as Germany have ruled that four-year bans on athletes are illegal under restraint of trade legislation , making such penalties unenforceable . 
former East German sprinter Katrin Krabbe recently won a court battle to overturn a ban , opening the door to German athletes to sue the IAAF if banned long-term . 
other successful legal cases against IAAF-imposed bans by athletes include those of American 400 metres runner Butch Reynolds and British middle-distance runner Diane Modahl . 
two athletes were also allowed to compete in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics despite positive dope tests prior to the Games because sports chiefs were afraid of legal action . 
&quot; Sanctions that were around 40 or 50 years ago are no longer any use , &quot; insisted de Merode . 
&quot; If we have sanctions that are systematically thrown out by the law courts , it is clear that the IOC have learnt nothing and that the fight against doping is lost , &quot; he said . 
&quot; A sanction is only useful in so far as it can be applied . 
de Merode said long bans that prevented an athlete from earning a living were no longer acceptable . 
he suggested three proposals , starting with short , flexible bans ranging from between one to six months . 
these could be accompanied by measures banning the athlete from a certain number of competitions . 
&quot; This would have the advantage of losing him or her money , reducing his or her market value but allowing the athlete a way back into the sport , &quot; he said . 
a second measure would be to impose financial sanctions -- &quot; they don &apos;t kill but they hurt , &quot; he said . 
the third measure would be &quot; educational &quot; in nature , forcing an athlete to remain under special surveillance for a period of up to one year to prove his or her clean status . 
&quot; This would be a more modern solution . 
a fixed sanction is out of date , it is no longer possible today , &quot; De Merode said . 
he dismissed suggestions of a sea-change in policy at the IOC , saying the proposals were realistic . 
questioned by Reuters on any time frame for new sanctions to be introduced , De Merode was vague . 
&quot; You know that when you raise new ideas , they have to be discussed , &quot; he said .
