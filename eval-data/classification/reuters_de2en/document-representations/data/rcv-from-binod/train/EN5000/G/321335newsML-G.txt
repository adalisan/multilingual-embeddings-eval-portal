justice Minister Carlos Medellin said on Tuesday that Colombia not only deserves full U.S. &quot; certification &quot; for its anti-drug efforts but that it should be rewarded for them as well . 
&quot; judging what &apos;s been done , objectively , ( we deserve ) not only full certification but decorations , &quot; Medellin said . 
U.S. President Bill Clinton must decide by March 1 whether to certify that Colombia is cooperating in the global fight against drugs . 
Clinton &quot; decertified &quot; the Andean nation last year , a move partly prompted by the scandal stemming from charges that President Ernesto Samper used millions of dollars in drug money to finance his 1994 election campaign . 
U.S. government sources have ruled out the possibility that Colombia will regain full certification this year . 
and a judge &apos;s decision last week to give extremely lenient prison sentences to two of the world &apos;s most powerful drug traffickers has fuelled widespread speculation that renewed decertification could trigger U.S. economic sanctions that Clinton fell short of imposing last year . 
Medellin , who spoke in an interview with the Radionet news network , stressed that the government had nothing to do with the decision handed down last Friday by a so-called &quot; faceless &quot; or anonymous judge in Cali . 
the judge gave prison sentences to brothers Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela , the billionaire leaders of the Cali drug cartel , that could allow them to walk free in as little as five years . 
the Rodriguez brothers and other Cali cartel kingpins are alleged to have poured up to $ 6 million into Samper &apos;s election campaign .
