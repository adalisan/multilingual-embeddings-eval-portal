Philippine stocks took a further battering on Tuesday and market analysts said the short-term outlook was no more promising despite a host of strong economic indicators . 
since October 1 , the Philippine Stock Exchange index has fallen by more than four percent , mainly on last quarter portfolio shuffling by foreign funds and on fears of an impending end to the current property boom . 
Tuesday &apos;s fall of 83 points , or 2.7 percent , to 3,037 coming on relatively higher trading volumes led to predictions the downward trend would continue . 
&quot; gazing at our crystal ball , we see darkness , &quot; Manila brokerage Anscor Hagedorn said in a report . 
&quot; That &apos;s how the market is right now : full of uncertainty , no clear direction in sight . 
the fall came after the Philippines last Friday announced that inflation had fallen to a nine-year low of 4.4 percent in September , down from 7.9 percent in August . 
brokers said the selling , concentrated on the heavily capitalised property sector , was triggered by foreign funds . 
&quot; They ( foreign funds ) are taking profits on the Philippines and moving it elsewhere , &quot; Raul Ruiz , vice-president for research at brokerage Sun hung Kai Securities said . 
Manila stocks had risen by over 20 percent since January while other markets in the region were depressed , &quot; which is why most fund managers are trying to book profits &quot; , he said . 
foreign funds account for over 50 percent of daily volumes on the Manila stock market which average around 2.5 billion pesos ( $ 95 million ) . 
but on Tuesday , the volume surged to nearly 3.0 billion pesos ( $ 114 million ) . 
&quot; With relatively high turnovers accompanying drops , technicals point to the continued drop in the index , &quot; brokerage BPI Securities said in its market report . 
one broker said the biggest seller was the Hong Kong-based fund Jardine Fleming whose brokerage unit in Manila is by far the biggest on the Philippine Stock Exchange . 
but a spokesman for Jardine in Hong Kong denied it was selling and said the fund was still overweight in Manila . 
brokerage Philippine Asia Equity Securities in its report on Tuesday said : &quot; The market was hugely down today as foreign fund managers continued to reduce their weightings on Asian markets including the Philippines . 
the stock market picture has contrasted with the overall economic mood in the country with interest rates seen falling to a single digit by next year . 
yields on the Philippines &apos; benchmark 91-day treasury bills have been falling continuously for the past few months . 
at the latest auction on Monday , the rate fell to 11.587 percent from 13.189 percent on May 7 . 
the lower interest rates coupled with a forecast by Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson of 7.0 to 7.5 percent gross national product ( GNP ) growth in 1996 had put together all the ingredients needed for a bull run .
