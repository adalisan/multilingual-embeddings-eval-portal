the Polish bourse , which has risen 20 percent since December 10 to 15,974.6 points , should extend this week &apos;s slower 3.6-percent growth next week , though a correction looked ever more possible , analysts said . 
&quot; The level of 16,000 points could provide temporary psychological resistance but I think it will be beaten in the near future , &quot; said Tomasz Cwintal , an analyst at Bank Gospodarki Zywnosciowej ( BGZ ) brokerage . 
analysts said continued growth by large-cap stocks such as Elektrim , which gained 21.2 percent this week , signalled buying by foreign and institutional investors acting on their firms &apos; fresh picks for 1997 . 
they said another good sign was that 1996 year-on-year inflation ended at a respectable 18.5 percent , with the central bank saying it would likely put off for a month a possible interest-rate rise to cut fast credit growth . 
analyst said investors would be watching firms &apos; December earnings results , most of them due on Friday and Monday . 
firms such as the week &apos;s top gainers , Optimus up 27.6 percent and Polfa Kutno up 26.9 percent , were seen helped by expectations of strong seasonal earnings . 
analysts said Optimus was also boosted by the announcement it would receive a dividend from a subsidiary and that it would seek a strategic investor after completing its convertible bond programme , which was running smoothly . 
they said Kutno was also buoyed by speculation it would shed its veterinary medicines division . 
but analysts said a profit-taking correction still loomed . 
&quot; Our most recent highs have not been accompanied by those really high turnovers ... and last year we saw corrections after similar gains over similar periods , &quot; said Wojciech Bialek , an analyst at Magnus brokerage . 
Bialek saw the bourse extending gains before being hit by a correction at mid-week . 
analysts said the week &apos;s top losers , Indykpol down six percent and Espebepe , were both hit by profit taking after recent gains . 
they said the bevy of small primary offers slated for January and February would likely not draw significant capital from stocks , with larger offers such as copper concern KGHM Polska Miedz SA at mid-year seen drawing more funds . 
on Monday public offering subscription periods of builder Unibud SA and chipboard maker Grajewo SA start , the latter representing the largest of the batch at the start of the year . 
analysts said Stomil Sanok , which surged 9.1 percent on Friday after opening 120 percent above issue , could soon extend gains despite the threat of a brief correction .
