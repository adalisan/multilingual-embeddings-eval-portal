Germany &apos;s Bundesbank council was set to release a statement on a Bonn plan to revalue its assets on Wednesday evening which one council member said had been backed unanimously by the 17-man policy-making group . 
Council member Helmut Hesse told Reuters at a reception in Frankfurt , which began soon after the council meeting had ended , that the statement from the central bank would be released at around 1700 GMT . 
&quot; The central bank council approved the statement unanimously , &quot; Hesse said . 
he added that the statement had been passed to the Finance Ministry for its consideration before release . 
a second Bundesbank council member , Hans-Juergen Koebnick , confirmed the timing for the release and added the statement would be &quot; brief and worth reading &quot; . 
neither man made any comment on the contents of the prepared statement . 
the plan tabled by German Finance Minister Theo Waigel to revalue the Bundesbank &apos;s gold and foreign exchange assets to drum up funds to ease Bonn &apos;s strapped finances had topped the agenda for the scheduled Bundesbank council meeting . 
no details have been formally published yet , although a German newspaper reported in broad terms on the plans earlier on Wednesday . 
in Bonn , officials were tight-lipped on the contents of a draft paper on the proposed changes in accounting procedure which was being considered at the Bundesbank meeting . 
the Boersen-Zeitung had reported that the paper contained proposals for a revaluation of central bank reserves which will result in a payment to Bonn in two tranches , one in 1997 and one in 1998 . 
the newspaper , which did not name its sources , said Bonn had proposed an interim balance sheet which will allow a payment of more than 10 billion marks ( $ 5.9 billion ) in 1997 . 
coalition sources had told Reuters on Tuesday that a revaluation towards market prices could boost federal finances by an extra 10 billion to 12 billion marks in 1997 and by a similar amount in 1998 . 
neither Waigel nor Juergen Stark , secretary of state at the finance ministry , attended the meeting , although both made an appearance when the plan was presented two weeks ago . 
financial markets will be looking closely at the Bundesbank statement to assess the level of the central bank &apos;s support for the Bonn plan . 
Waigel &apos;s scheme has already unsettled some who say the move will pave the way for a weak single European currency . 
Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier , the opposition SPD &apos;s financial expert , told German radio she rejected a revaluation of the gold reserves at the current time combined with an early transfer of special profit to the government . 
&quot; Operation gold hoard clearly damages the reputation of the Bundesbank and of European monetary union , &quot; she said . 
she added the impression was correct that &quot; this tweaking of balance sheets is being done to reach the criteria for the euro . 
Waigel told journalists in Frankfurt on Tuesday that a special interim Bundesbank balance sheet had been drawn up and as a result Bonn could receive a payout from such reserve revaluations this year . 
but his comments came as Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer was reported in an unconfirmed newspaper report as having warned Bonn two months ago that any such revaluation in the run-up to EMU risked damaging Germany &apos;s credibility . 
the Bundesbank has some 95 million ounces of gold in reserve valued at well below current market levels . 
confusion still remains about whether Bonn can find a way to use the measure to cut back its 1997 budget deficit to the three percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) required for entry into the single European currency . 
the Bundesbank &apos;s council meeting on Wednesday is one of its regular fortnightly meetings . 
it has been brought forward by one day because Thursday is a regional holiday in Germany . 
the Bundesbank &apos;s discount rate , the floor to money market rates , and the Lombard ceiling rate have been steady at 2.50 percent and 4.50 percent respectively since April last year .
