CIM Resources Ltd said on Tuesday it has increased sales of coking coal to Japanese steel mills by 30 percent to over 1.3 million tonnes for the 1997 fiscal year ( April-March ) . 
CIM said negotiations with the Japanese steel mills resulted in a net decline in price of about 1.5 percent when compared with terms for current fiscal year 
CIM chief executive Michael Palmer said the sales outcome was very pleasing as the majority of coal sold into Japan had now been committed on long-term contracts with three major customers . 
he said CIM had accepted a small price reduction for the coal due to the highly competitive nature of the international market . 
&quot; Whilst the price negotiated , which will nett CIM approximately 1.5 percent below the average of contractual prices received in the current JFY ( Japanese fiscal year ) , was disappointing compared to industry expectations prior to the negotiations , it was a far better result than that achieved by other Hunter Valley coking coal producers , &quot; the statement said . 
&quot; The substantial increase in tonnage and the long term contracts , together with the lower than average price reduction , confirm the high level of acceptance of Stratford coking coal by the Japanese steel mills , which have reported positively on the performance of the coal in coke oven blends , &quot; it said .
