the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) has no plans for an immediate rate rise and earlier quoted comments by the BOJ deputy governor on monetary policy were not correct , a senior BOJ official said on Wednesday . 
&quot; The BOJ has no plans to raise rates immediately , &quot; Takahiro Kawase , director of the BOJ &apos;s policy planning department , told reporters in a briefing . 
Kawase , who also attended the meeting with Rengo , said the deputy governor explained to the labour group that the central bank will , for the time being , continue to carry out a monetary policy that emphasises strengthening the basis for economic recovery . 
&quot; We have not changed the monetary policy stance that we have taken up until now , &quot; Kawase said . 
he added that Fukui expressed an &quot; understanding &quot; of Rengo &apos;s consideraton for pensioners living on interest payments but not of its request for a rate rise . 
Kawase also said Rengo &apos;s explanation of their meeting , made at a news conference earlier on Wednesday , was not correct . 
an executive of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation ( Rengo ) , Japan &apos;s largest grouping of labour unions , told reporters that BOJ Deputy Governor Toshihiko Fukui said in a meeting with the group that the BOJ is considering the right timing to raise the official discount rate but that it does not want to make a hasty decision . 
the group visited the bank and requested a rise in the official discount rate . 
Fukui was also quoted as saying that the request was understandable . 
the quoted comments triggered massive selling of Japanese government bonds , dragging down Tokyo share prices and the dollar as well .
