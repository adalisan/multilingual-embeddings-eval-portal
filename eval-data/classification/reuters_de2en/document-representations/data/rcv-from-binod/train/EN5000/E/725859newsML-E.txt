a slower recovery in Japan &apos;s non-manufacturing sector and by smaller firms will not affect the overall economic recovery , the Bank of Japan &apos;s ( BOJ ) Osaka branch manager Eiichiro Kinoshita said on Monday . 
asked whether the difference in the rate of recovery among different industries and companies of different sizes will hinder the economic recovery , Kinoshita said : &quot; Although there may be an increase in the number of those being left behind , this will not influence ( overall ) economic movements . 
Kinoshita , who is also an executive director of the central bank , said he felt there was a need for certain industries to take up the role of leaders in the economic recovery . 
&quot; The strength of such industries and the extent of their impact is an important factor in gauging the economy . 
but there will be some industries which cannot catch up ( with the economic trend ) and will be left behind , &quot; Kinoshita said . 
other BOJ managers at key branches in Nagoya , Sapporo and Fukuoka said that current foreign exchange rates would not significantly affect exports from their regions . 
&quot; Basically , in the near term , current exchange rate levels will not significantly hurt exports or cause them to decrease , &quot; Yoshiharu Obata , manager of BOJ &apos;s Nagoya branch , told reporters . 
Obata said that , although the yen is stronger than it was when it weakened to 127 yen per dollar earlier in May , manufacturers in the Nagoya region , home to a good deal of automobile-related production , have become less susceptible to currency fluctuations due to restructuring efforts . 
Naoto Furutachi , manager of the BOJ &apos;s Fukuoka branch , added that the current exchange rate level was within the range expected by companies in his region . 
he added , however , that exporting manufacturers in his region did not want the yen to strengthen any further . 
in the Osaka area of western Japan , the Osaka branch &apos;s Kinoshita said the difference in the rate of recovery between large and small manufacturers was not expanding . 
the smaller non-manufacturers are being affected by structural changes , but the slower rates of recovery are more a result of differences in how each firm deals with the changes , he said . 
corporate capital spending among manufacturers in the Osaka area is relatively steady , with small and medium-sized firms also positive about investing , he said . 
&quot; There may be substantially more capital investment compared with the previous year , &quot; Kinoshita said . 
capital spending among non-manufacturers is rather weak , due to the winding down of investments related to rebuilding after the massive Kobe earthquake of early 1995 and the completion of new mobile phone facilities . 
&quot; Overall , we see no big change in capital investment among non-manufacturing firms , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There &apos;s no big change in economic trends ( in the Osaka area ) . 
we don &apos;t expect the economy to worsen from its present state , but we see no factors which indicate that the speed of the recovery will strengthen immediately , &quot; Kinoshita said . 
movements in private consumption and corporate capital spending , the key components of private-sector demand , are as expected , he said . 
the negative impact of the rise in the consumption tax from April is evident , but there are no indications that purchasing power has decreased or that consumer sentiment has worsened , Kinoshita said .
