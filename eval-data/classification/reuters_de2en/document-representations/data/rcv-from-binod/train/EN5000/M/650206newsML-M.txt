U.S. Treasury securities prices ended narrowly range bound on Tuesday as traders had little economic data for direction on the economy . 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond manufacturing new orders index fell to 16 from 25 in April and the service revenues index fell to 26 in May from 33 in April , but neither statistic had much market impact . 
&quot; The market &apos;s a little bit choppy . 
there &apos;s not a lot going on , &quot; said Josh Feinman , vice president and global markets economist at Bankers Trust Co . 
Feinman said more market participants were becoming comfortable with the notion that the Federal Reserve would not move to hike short-term interest rates at its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meeting on July 2 . 
he added that whether the Fed would voted to move was a close call , but more data over the next several weeks would weigh heavily on any decisions . 
Feinman expected that the Fed had the leeway to hold off in July , but that the federal funds rate would be raised 6.0 percent by the end of the year as economic growth would pause and then begin to rise again . 
&quot; There was a lot of hedge fund selling , &quot; said Cary Leahey , senior economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc . 
he added that a strong Redbook report on retail sales ( up 2.3 percent in the latest survey ) helped push prices lower . 
&quot; The unemployment rate is a lagging indicator &quot; so people are still unsure on whether the economy is slowing or not , Leahey said . 
he said the Fed was not likely to raise interest rates again in July , but he as most economists said it was a tough call . 
the Fed last hiked the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at its March 25 meeting . 
&quot; We &apos;re going to do exactly what we &apos;re doing ( range trading ) until Thursday , &quot; said Fred Sturm , economist at Fuji Securities Inc . 
retail sales were scheduled for released on Thursday , and were considered the most important data for the week . 
the only wild card that may make Wednesday &apos;s session interesting is the value of the dollar , Sturm said . 
&quot; We &apos;re going to be doing exactly this until Thusrday morning . 
&quot; The consumer is king and the court Chamberlain is inventory , &quot; Sturm said . 
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended at 97-10 / 32 , down 5 / 32 , yielding 6.84 percent . 
two-year notes ended at 100-5 / 32 , down 1 / 32 to yield 6.16 percent . 
five-year notes fell 3 / 32 to 100-7 / 32 to yield 6.45 percent and the 10-year note was off 5 / 32 to 100-14 / 32 , its yield at 6.56 percent .
