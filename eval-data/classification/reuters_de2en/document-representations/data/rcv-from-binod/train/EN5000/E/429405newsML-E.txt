the lack of a transparent policy framework and unwieldy bureaucratic procedures have throttled the growth of India &apos;s infrastructure sector , crucial for achieving higher economic growth , business leaders said . 
&quot; The government policy framework needs clarity , comprehensive speedy clearances and simplified procedures , &quot; said Subodh Bhargava , group chief executive and vice-chairman of Eicher Goodearth Ltd . 
foreign and domestic business leaders speaking at an international conference during the weekend urged the government to overhaul its ailing infrastructure to step up economic growth . 
the government estimates that Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) will grow by 6.8 percent in the 1996 / 97 fiscal year ending March 31 , and by seven percent or more in 1997 / 98 . 
&quot; Will it not be correct to say that , everything remaining the same , better infrastructural support could lead to a national economic growth rate of 8.0 percent or higher ? , &quot; said D.V. 
Kapur , chairman of reliance Power Limited . 
India &apos;s six infrastructure industries - electricity , coal , steel , crude oil , petroleum products and cement - grew 3.3 percent in the April-December period of 1996 compared with 8.8 percent in the same period in the previous year . 
business leaders urged the government to introduce transparency in policy , speed up approvals and set up a regulatory mechanism to ensure a &quot; level playing field &quot; to firms in infrastructure . 
&quot; The ground rules must be spelt out upfront and not changed mid-stream , &quot; said Deepak Parekh , chairman of Housing Development Finance Corp Ltd . 
senior power sector officials also blamed complex and inefficient bureaucratic procedures for an acute power shoratge that appeared to be thwarting industrial growth . 
India , which opened up infrastructure under a liberalisation programme in 1991 , needs massive investments of $ 130-150 billion in the next five years to ease bottlenecks in power , telecommunications , roads , airports and ports . 
&quot; Infrastructure investment must be really beefed up , &quot; Rakesh Mohan , director general of the National Council of applied Economic Research ( NCAER ) , said . 
&quot; We need $ 130-150 billion of investment in the next five years . 
Mohan said domestic savings , which stood at 25.6 percent of GDP in 1995 / 96 compared with 24.9 percent in the previous year , was encouraging and should be more efficiently used for financing infrastructure . 
&quot; The problem is that savers will require creditable safe instruments , &quot; he added . 
the government must open up insurance and pension funds and facilitate creation of a vibrant bond market to raise funds for infrastructure development , Mohan said . 
long-term sophisticated financial instruments , both in debt and equity , were not currently available to investors , Parekh said . 
but many business leaders felt it was not the paucity of funds but bureaucratic red tape which prevented firms from investing in India . 
&quot; You keep your democracy but drop your socialism , &quot; Gordon Wu , managing director of Hopewell Holdings Ltd , said . 
&quot; Cut the red tape .
