spring wheat bids continued to climb on Wednesday , in line with gains in MGE futures , with basis increases also noted as elevators tried to attract wheat , several cash merchants said . 
&quot; We had 39 ( rail ) cars for receipts today , so until we get some more cars showing up , we &apos;re going to keep firming up the basis , &quot; a Minneapolis-based dealer said . 
he said more than 200 cars would be needed to meet demand . 
bids there were up 14 cents to $ 4.96 per bushel while futures prices rose by only 8-1 / 2 cents to $ 4.16 . 
that location was quoting bids at $ 4.62 per bushel on Monday .

MGE December wheat futures have risen 38 cents per bushel since last week . 
in Montana , the rally sparked some farmer selling this week as prices moved back above $ 4 per bushel , a dealer said . 
&quot; We &apos;re loading a train , we &apos;re buying wheat . 
things are pretty busy around here , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It &apos;s been a while since I &apos;ve been able to say that .
