investment bank Deutsche Morgan Grenfell ( DMG ) NZ Ltd said on Wednesday it expected New Zealand &apos;s economic growth to weaken over the next three years . 
DMG chief economist Ulf Schoefisch said the effect of increased fiscal expenditure on growth over the next three years would be largely offset by tight monetary policy . 
&quot; As a result , economic growth will only average 2.8 percent , compared with 3.7 percent over the past three years , &quot; he said in an economic commentary . 
Schoefisch said that a combination of expansionary fiscal policy and tight monetary conditions would mean growth being driven primarily by the domestic sector . 
but DMG &apos;s forecasts showed that household sector demand for goods and residential property would be relatively weak . 
maintaining the exchange rate at whatit called an &quot; overvalued &quot; level would constrain export growth and further encourage imports , he added . 
Schoefisch also expected the current account deficit to widen to five to six percent of GDP in three year &apos;s time from 4.2 percent in calendar 1996 . 
a &quot; pre-emptive &quot; approach to monetary policy would succeed in keeping inflation pressures under control , within the underlying inflation forecast , averaging 1.6 percent over the three years . 
weak growth and increased government spending would also reduce the fiscal surplus to around 1-2 percent of GDP , he said . 
as a result , DMG forecast the net public debt to GDP ratio would be 23 percent by the end of the decade , markedly above the 18 percent projected by the treasury . 
according to the German bank , the trough of the current growth cycle is occuring now -- in the first half of this year . 
the bank also forecast that , assuming there is a mild downward correction in the New Zealand dollar , 90-day bank bill rates could be expected to drift up over the year . 
it forecast the yield premium of 10-year New Zealand government bonds over their U.S. equivalents would be in a 100 to 130 basis point range .
