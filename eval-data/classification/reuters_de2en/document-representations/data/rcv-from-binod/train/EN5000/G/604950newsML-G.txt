President Boris Yeltsin , in a forceful display of authority over the armed forces , sacked Russia &apos;s two top defence officials on Thursday , accusing them of dragging their heels over much-needed military reform in the middle of a budget crisis . 
Yeltsin singled out Defence Minister Igor Rodionov and general staff head Viktor Samsonov for a televised tongue-lashing at a meeting of the Defence Council of military leaders . 
&quot; I am not simply dissatisfied , I am indignant over the state of reforms in the army and the general state of the armed forces , &quot; Yeltsin said angrily before he sacked the two . 
&quot; The soldier is losing weight while the general is getting fatter . 
Yeltsin , who was backing reformist defence aide Yuri Baturin with his decision to sack Rodionov , then brought in a veteran of the strategic nuclear forces as acting defence minister . 
but he did not say how a long-term successor should carry out the costly goal of constructing a professional army from the top-heavy relics of the once-pampered armed forces , whose needs have contributed to the budget crisis currently facing Russia . 
signalling his firm backing for the government &apos;s reformist camp in the tussle over the future of the military , Yeltsin appointed two senior liberal ministers to the powerful Security Council of senior officials . 
the liberals , First Deputy Prime Ministers Boris Nemtsov and Anatoly Chubais , will defend government policy in the opposition-dominated State Duma lower house on Friday , when deputies debate a government request to cut spending across the board . 
Ministers , worried by dismal tax revenues but determined to resist pressure to print money to pay overdue wages and pensions , are asking for spending cuts totalling 108 trillion roubles ( $ 17.5 billion ) . 
but a vote would not be binding and ministers , taking comfort from vague phrasing in the budget law , which says the government must submit spending plans to parliament but does not say parliament must approve them , are likely to ignore it . 
Russia &apos;s military reform and security policy depends heavily on the nature of its ties with the Western NATO alliance . 
Yeltsin is due to sign a document in Paris next week setting out its new relationship with NATO . 
Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky on Thursday hailed the deal as a diplomatic triumph , but warned the Western alliance that offering membership to former Soviet republics would be like playing Russian roulette . 
&quot; We hope that sensible leaders in the West will not want to play Russian roulette , &quot; Yastrzhembsky said , referring to the daredevil game in which gamblers put one bullet in a revolver , spin the chamber , put the gun to their heads and fire . 
Yeltsin , who wants to strengthen ties with neighbouring states before the NATO expansion , is due to sign a union charter with Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko on Friday . 
both leaders have said they are determined to move towards closer integration , but they appear at odds over some key issues including the ultimate aim of the union . 
Lukashenko , unwilling to lose his own presidential status , has made clear that Belarus will remain a sovereign state . 
&quot; We have a certain limit -- our Soviet experience . 
under the Soviet Union we ( Belarus ) had our own United Nations membership , &quot; Lukashenko said . 
Yeltsin has spoken of Russia and Belarus merging into a single federative state by the end of the integration process . 
Yeltsin is due to visit Ukraine next week , although Kiev &apos;s top security official said on Thursday he had a &quot; bad feeling &quot; about whether the much-postponed visit would go ahead . 
&quot; A very active campaign has begun in Russian circles ... aimed at breaking off President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s visit , &quot; said Security Council secretary Volodymyr Horbulin . 
&quot; Before ( Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma &apos;s ) visit to the United States there was a warm hope that everything would be fine ... Now I have a bad feeling . 
but we &apos;ll our do our utmost to make this visit happen , without losing our dignity . 
in a further display of authority Yeltsin refused to sign a controversial law claiming Russian ownership of art seized from Nazi Germany during World War Two . 
he sent it back to parliament , saying procedures used to adopt the law had violated the constitution .
