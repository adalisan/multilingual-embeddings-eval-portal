a $ 50 million Euronote issued on Monday by Lebanon &apos;s Byblos Bank sold out in 30 minutes and Beirut bankers said its popularity showed that international financial markets were increasingly bullish on Lebanon . 
the issue was three times oversubscribed , according to Beirut finance house Lebanon Invest which managed the issue with SBC Warburg . 
&quot; It was allocated in half an hour . 
it was three times oversubscribed , &quot; Omar Jaroudi , senior manager for business development at Lebanon Invest , told Reuters . 
Byblos is one of Lebanon &apos;s fastest-growing banks , a trailblazer in the mortgage , credit card and personal loans business . 
it raised $ 11.6 million on the international equity market in a private share placement last year . 
its three-year bond , issued in London and to be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange , was set at 285 basis points over similar U.S. treasuries and has a yield of 9.335 percent . 
this compared with a 325 BP spread for a trailblazing $ 60 million Eurobond issued in June by Credit Libanais , another Beirut commercial bank . 
&quot; That &apos;s an excellent new benchmark ... especially as it was so much oversubscribed , &quot; Jaroudi said of the spread . 
an executive with anotrher Beirut bank said the success of the issue showed that demand for Lebanese paper in the international market was improving . 
&quot; There is bullish sentiment building . 
it says there is an improvement in the perception of Lebanon risk , &quot; said the banker , who asked not to be identified . 
Jaroudi said subscribers included local and foreign financial institutions . 
&quot; We had good interest from local financial institutions and from Japan and Europe , the ( United Arab ) Emirates and Saudi Arabia . 
the main European interest was from financial institutions in Switzerland , &quot; he said . 
Lebanon Invest also managed Byblos &apos; share placement last year . 
Jaroudi said the shares , which were issued at $ 2.62 , were now trading privately at $ 3.80 . 
they are not listed on the Beirut Stock Exchange . 
Beirut banks are showing increasing interest in raising money on the international market because of a lack of growth in deposits on the local market and the need for medium- and long-term financing to finance reconstruction projects .
