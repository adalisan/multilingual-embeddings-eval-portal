Poland &apos;s economy is not yet overheating , but it may overheat unless interest rates remain relatively high , the National Bank of Poland ( NBP ) President Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz said . 
&quot; I think that maybe it &apos;s not yet overheating , but it &apos;s quite probable to get overheating , &quot; Gronkiewicz-Waltz said in an interview for Reuters Financial Television at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland aired on Monday . 
&quot; It is the reason why we are keeping interest rates relatively high and why we decided last week to increase ( mandatory ) reserve requirements , &quot; she said . 
Gronkiewicz-Waltz said in an interview taped over the week-end that real interest rates would grow . 
but she added that future decisions on official rates , now at 25 and 22 percent , would depend on the impact the increase of obligatory reserves . 
&quot; We have to see what will be the behaviour of banks after the increase of reserve requirements , what will be the impact of the increased requirements on market interest rates , reverse repos and others , &quot; Gronkiewicz-Waltz said . 
last Monday the NBP announced that from February 28 it was increasing mandatory reserves on zloty call deposits to 20 percent from 17 percent and was doubling the reserves on currency deposits to four percent . 
Gronkiewicz-Waltz also reiterated the central bank &apos;s weak-zloty forecast , saying that the country &apos;s large trade deficit should keep the zloty from strengthening against the basket of currencies this year . 
&quot; We have quite a high deficit in our trade balance , so I think that we won &apos;t have appreciation of the zloty , &quot; she said . 
on Monday the zloty was about 2.4 percent stronger than the central bank &apos;s parity rate , the centre of the local currency &apos;s 14-percent trading band .
