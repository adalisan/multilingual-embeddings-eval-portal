Norwegian shares were lifted by a firming dollar with dollar-sensitive industrial conglomerate Norsk hydro hitting an all-time high on Tuesday . 
shipping shares were also performing well because of the dollar , traders said . 
Oslo &apos;s Total share index rose 0.63 percent to 1,247.51 points for a life high , but turnover was thin at 739 million crowns . 
&quot; Blue chips are doing well and hydro in particular , &quot; one trader said . 
hydro , the largest listed company in Norway , finished 1.01 percent higher at 402 crowns for the first time . 
&quot; By and large it is foreigners who are buying hydro stock , which is being pushed up by the strong dollar . 
some investors are probably also positioning themselves for hydro &apos;s second-quarter result on Monday . 
the shipping index rose 0.49 percent partly because of the positive dollar development . 
&quot; We also expect a strong tanker market in the near future , which is good for Bergesen , &quot; a trader said . 
the A share in Bergesen , Norway &apos;s largest shipping group , ended 0.54 percent higher at 185 crowns .
