Dutch money rates edged up fractionally across the board on Monday , but dealers said volumes were minimal . 
overnight guilders were trading up around six basis points during the morning session at 3.12-3.18 percent , while three- month , six-month and one-year guilders were all quoted two basis points higher at 3.24 , 3.32 and 3.44 percent bid respectively . 
but dealers said the higher prices were unlikely to presage a rise in short-term liquidity rates , saying the guilder &apos;s relative softness against the mark was not underpinned by major trading volumes . 
the guilder was bidding at 112.65 per 100 marks on Monday , unchanged from its Friday fixing . 
some market watchers predict a renewed rise in the special advances rate if the guilder / mark cross reaches 112.670 . 
guilder / mark parity within the exchange rate mechanism has been set at 112.673 guilders per 100 marks .
