about 100 more Cuban doctors will go to work in South Africa this year , taking the total there to about 300 , visiting South African Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma said on Thursday . 
in an interview with the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina , Zuma said some 206 Cuban doctors were already working in South Africa . 
the first Cuban doctors went to South Africa last year on three-year contracts in a programme to improve medical facilities in poor rural and township areas . 
Zuma met President Fidel Castro on Tuesday and passed on greetings from President Nelson Mandela , Prensa Latina said . 
Cuba and South Africa established diplomatic ties in May 1994 , the day after Mandela took office .
