the Indonesian rupiah was softer against the dollar due to a spillover from the weaker Malaysian ringgit in early trading on Monday , dealers said . 
one U.S. bank dealer said fresh ringgit selling in a market response to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad &apos;s comments pushed the rupiah lower . 
however , profit-taking limited the downside . 
Mahathir told reporters on Friday the ringgit &apos;s fall of about five percent against the dollar was not much &quot; if compared with the deutschemark which has fallen by 17 percent &quot; . 
the dealer said dollar profit-takers and selling from state banks capped the upside at the 2,610 level . 
another local bank dealer said corporate orders and foreign dollar selling helped the rupiah recover to 2,601.0 / 03.0 at 0240 GMT from an opening of 2,608.0 / 13.0 . 
but the rupiah was lower than Friday &apos;s close of 2,598.0 . 
&quot; There were some fights at the 2,600 level . 
if the rupiah falls through the 2,600 barrier , it becomes the resistance level , but if it strengthens above that , the 2,600 becomes the support level for the rupiah , &quot; the U.S. bank dealer said . 
the dealer said there was some resistance for the rupiah to breach the 2,600 barrier because of renewed pressure on the Malaysian ringgit . 
&quot; There is not much drive in the market . 
volume is pretty thin , with operators seen sidelined . 
it &apos;s a non-event day . 
the U.S. bank dealer said swaps were also stable on adequate liquidity supply in the money market . 
overnight money was at 15.0 / 15.5 percent on Monday morning . 
overnight swap was at 0.45 / 0.55 and Tom / next at 0.40 / 0.42 . 
one-month swap was at 19.5 / 20.5 , two at 37.0 / 42.0 , three at 57.0 / 63.0 and six at 118.5 / 122.0 points . 
the central bank kept its intervention band at 2,378 / 2,682 but raised the conversion band to 2,573 / 2,621 on Friday from 2,567 / 2,615 on Thursday .
