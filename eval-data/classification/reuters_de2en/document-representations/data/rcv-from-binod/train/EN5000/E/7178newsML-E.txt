the following are analysts reaction to the west German IFO business confidence index for July , which rose to 94.1 from 90.4 in June . 
the June figure was a three-month low . 
economists in a Reuter survey had on average predicted the index at 91.0 for July . 
Karen Kricks-Brunnlieb , Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt 
&quot; The figure is much higher than expected , but it doesn &apos;t change our expectations because we do not expect a repo rate cut . 
Armin Kayser , Swiss Bank Corp , Frankfurt : 
&quot; I think the IFO numbers have been quite in contrast to economic reality during the last few months . 
the assessment of the business situation , which is one part of the IFO business sentiment figure , has been deterioriating while the real data , such as industrial production , has been trending upward . 
my view has not changed because of this data . 
the upward revision of new orders data and the improvement in the IFO data do not favour a rate cut . 
there is no strong reason for the Bundesbank to stimulate the economy . 
&quot; This is very difficult to assesss . 
June was a very difficult figure and saw it as an abberation to the trend . 
the July figure is again somewhat an abberation figure . 
one sector may have contributed to the data , the energy sector . 
&quot; The overall picture of the economy is that it slowed down considerably . 
the overall perception will definitely not change because of this figure . 
&quot; We still see a 60 percent probability of a repo rate cut tomorrow , of about five to 10 basis points . 
it would keep the interest rate hopes alive . 
&quot; We still see potential for a ( discount ) rate cut two percent . 
Fritz Engelhard , Bayerische Vereinsbank , Munich : 
&quot; It is an improvement over last month but we have to take the figures as they are . 
the rebound is from a very weak reading and , of course , I think the trend must continue to that extent . 
&quot; I think that this number doesn &apos;t change much in the Bundesbank &apos;s view to cut the repo rate by about 10 basis points . 
even if they don &apos;t do it tomorrow , the expectations should be very high that they do it soon . 
they focus very much on credit growth . 
&quot; A second thing is that the Bundesbank is focusing very much on the forex market . 
the mark is not at the level that they would like . 
they would prefer a weaker mark .
