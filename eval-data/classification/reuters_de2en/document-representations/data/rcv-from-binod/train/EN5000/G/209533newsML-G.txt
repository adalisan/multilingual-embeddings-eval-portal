unidentified gunmen opened fire with grenade launchers and automatic rifles on a bus carrying Russian border guards in the Tajik capital Dushanbe on Friday , killing two servicemen and wounding six . 
&quot; They &apos;ve done this to scare us , &quot; said a Russian officer at the scene who declined to be identified . 
shattered glass covered the site of the attack which was cordoned off by Tajik and Russian security forces . 
officials said the gunmen opened fire from a student &apos;s hostel some 30-40 metres ( yards ) away from the bus . 
they said several people had been detained . 
the attack followed an incident on Thursday when another group of gunmen fired on a bus in Dushanbe , seriously wounding two Russian servicemen . 
thousands of Russian troops guard the remote , mountainous country &apos;s border with Afghanistan and fulfil peacekeeping duties there . 
civil war has raged for four years in the former Soviet republic between forces of the embattled Tajik government and those of the Islamic opposition . 
dozens of Russian soldiers in Dushanbe have been killed and injured in attacks blamed on the opposition .
