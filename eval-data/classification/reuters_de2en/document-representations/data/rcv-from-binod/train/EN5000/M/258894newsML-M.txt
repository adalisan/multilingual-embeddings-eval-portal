CBOT rice futures closed firm on a strong tone in the benchmark Thai price and on slow producer sellling in the U.S. , traders said . 
&quot; The Thai price was at $ 325 ( per tonne ) , up from about $ 320 last week , &quot; a trader said . 
traders noted a small volume of domestic and export business but farmer selling was light , which helped keep prices firm . 
prospects for sales of rice to Iraq lent some support to world prices , traders said . 
&quot; Support on Iraq is looming in the background for 200,000 tonnes but that ( rice ) probably will come from Vietnam , &quot; a trader said . 
rice futures volume was estimated at 350 contracts , above the 326 traded Friday . 
rice futures closed one to three cents per cwt higher , with January up two at $ 10.69 .
