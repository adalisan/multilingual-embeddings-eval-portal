German Chancellor Helmut Kohl could scarcely have chosen a more apt spot for his talks on Thursday with Russian President Boris Yeltsin . 
the stately spa resort of Baden-Baden near the French border is no stranger to Russian rulers . 
Yeltsin &apos;s reputation as a risk-taker and his recent health problems also seem quite in place in a town best known for its casino and curative waters . 
&quot; Nice town you &apos;ve got here ! 
&quot; he told delighted locals during a brief walkabout in the sunshine . 
few , if any , of the crowned heads who passed through Baden-Baden in its 19th-century heyday would have shaken hands and even performed a brief mime in the way Yeltsin did . 
but his visit followed in a tradition of tsars and aristocrats who came to take the waters and gamble away family fortunes . 
Fyodor Dostoyevsky , who spent weeks at a time at the roulette tables , immortalised the tortured soul of the Russian aristocracy -- and Baden-Baden casino in the process -- in his novel &quot; The gambler &quot; . 
writers Nikolai Gogol , Lev Tolstoy and Ivan Turgenev also spent long spells in the resort after Tsar Alexander I established its popularity in Russia with a visit in 1813 . 
&quot; It is good here -- green , sunny , fresh and beautiful , &quot; Turgenev wrote of Baden-Baden , where he set his novel &quot; Smoke &quot; among the Russian community . 
Yeltsin , who earned a reputation as a risk-taker when he broke the back of Soviet communism , might have sensed the ghost of the last tsar as he swept past the gold onion-domed Russian Church on his way into town on Wednesday . 
Nicholas II , executed with his family after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution that all but put an end to the Russian presence at the spa , worshipped at the church . 
it now finds itself caught in a property dispute between Moscow and Bonn . 
Yeltsin , facing earnest requests from his friend Kohl for the return of German artworks seized by Soviet troops from the Nazis , was to put forward a counter-demand at the talks . 
he wants churches like that in Baden-Baden returned to the Moscow-based Orthodox Church , overturning a Nazi-era law that handed them to the aristocratic Russian church in exile . 
the Kremlin emphatically denied reports in the German press that Yeltsin , who lunched with Kohl in a country restaurant before accepting a &quot; Man of the Year &quot; award from the German media , might undergo medical treatment during his stay . 
many of Baden-Baden &apos;s leafy villas , nestling in the rolling landscape of the Black Forest , have been turned into upmarket clinics specialising in a range of complex treatments for those needing more than a simple drink or a bathe in the health-giving waters . 
the 66-year-old president , who had a heart bypass last November and suffered pneumonia early this year , is due to take a few days &apos; holiday in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on his return . 
Yeltsin looked pale and tired when he first met Kohl . 
some locals hope Yeltsin &apos;s visit could stimulate the already noticeable trickle of Russian visitors coming back to Baden-Baden . 
High-rolling &quot; New Russians &quot; , who got rich quick under Yeltsin , are already in evidence , following in Dostoyevsky &apos;s footsteps at the gaming tables . 
some hotels offer Russian borshch -- beetroot soup -- on the menu . 
and the only graffiti in evidence in the otherwise spotless town was in Russian -- &quot; I love you , &quot; it said .
