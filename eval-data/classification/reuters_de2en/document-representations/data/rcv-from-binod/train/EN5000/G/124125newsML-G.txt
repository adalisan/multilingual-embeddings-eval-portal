French President Jacques Chirac has decided his foreign minister will not accompany him on a visit to Israel next week but a junior minister will defy Israeli opposition and visit a disputed Palestinian headquarters in Arab East Jerusalem , his spokesman said on Thursday . 
presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said Chirac had told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of his intention to send Foreign Minister Herve de Charette to Orient House , the unofficial PLO headquarters in East Jerusalem , in line with European Union policy , during the French leader &apos;s visit to the Middle East from Saturday . 
Netanyahu had objected and prolonged negotiation had not eased the Israeli stance , she said . 
&quot; The president has decided with great regret that Mr de Charette will not accompany him to Israel , although he will be on all the other stages of the trip , &quot; Colonna said . 
&quot; The president has decided that junior health minister Herve Gaymard will be charged with going to Orient House . 
the diplomatic clash was announced two days before Chirac is due to begin a tour of Syria , Israel , the Palestinian territories , Jordan , Lebanon and Egypt .
