authorities say there are increasings signs that drug traffickers were involved in two high-profile criminal cases linked to the most powerful circles of Mexican politics , a newspaper roeported on Sunday . 
the Mexico City daily El Financiero said officials were building a case linking drugs to the March 1994 assassination of ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio , in part because of contacts Colosio may have had with particular drug barons . 
&quot; We have to investigate whether the policies that Luis Donaldo Colosio was trying to implement could have affected certain drug cartels , &quot; El Financiero quoted the special prosecutor in the case , Luis Raul Gonzalez Perez , as saying . 
according to the El Financiero report , investigators have established that Colosio had contacts with the Juarez-based Gulf cartel . 
Gonzalez alluded to an incident in which Colosio barred a known leader of the Gulf cartel from attending a campaign party , cancelling his invitation at the last minute . 
the report comes two days after the Swiss government said it suspected that drug money has flowed into the Swiss bank accounts of Raul Salinas de Gortari , the brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . 
Raul Salinas was arrested in 1995 for the 1994 killing of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu , secretary general of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( pri ) . 
he later was charged with illegal enrichment after authorities discovered the Swiss bank account , which contained $ 84 million . 
the recent disclosures add to increasing anecdotal evidence that the Colosio assassination and case of Raul Salinas &apos;s millions were both intertwined with the drug trade . 
U.S. officials say international drug cartels spend $ 6 billion a year bribing Mexican officials for safe passage of their illicit product to the lucrative U.S. market . 
Colosio was gunned down at a campaign rally in the northern border city of Tijuana on March 23 , 1994 . 
so far only one man , confessed gunman Mario Aburto , has been definitively linked to the crime after a lengthy probe in which four special prosecutors have pursued 27 lines of investigation . 
Colosio was forced to cancel the party invitation of Humberto Garcia Abrego , brother and lieutenant of Juan Garcia Abrego , the one-time chief of the Gulf cartel , El Financiero said . 
Juan Garcia Abrego was caught in 1996 and deported to the United States , where he was sentenced to life in prison by a federal court . 
according to one unproven theory , the Tijuana-based Pacific drug cartel may have wanted Colosio dead for fear that he was too close to the rival Gulf cartel and might side with them in order to crack down on Tijuana . 
&quot; We can &apos;t count out that narco-traffickers are involved ( in the Colosio murder ) , &quot; El Financiero quoted Gonzalez as saying . 
in the second case , pri secretary general Ruiz Massieu was shot and killed outside a Mexico City hotel on Sept . 28 , 1994 . 
in Feburary 1995 , Raul Salinas was arrested on suspicion of ordering the murder . 
after Raul Salinas was jailed , his wife was caught attempting to withdraw money from a secret Swiss bank account that her husband controlled under an assumed name . 
the Swiss government , which since has frozen the $ 84 million pending an investigation , issued a statement on Friday saying witnesses in the United States have tied him to drug traffickers . 
Raul Salinas , questioned by Swiss prosecutors last week , has claimed the money came from an investment scheme involving some of Mexico &apos;s richest men .
