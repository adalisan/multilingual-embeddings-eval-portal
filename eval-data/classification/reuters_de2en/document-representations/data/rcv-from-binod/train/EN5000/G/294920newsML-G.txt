British tycoon Richard Branson , attempting to become the first man to fly round the world in a balloon , will be forced to land within the next few hours due to a technical problem , Britain &apos;s Press Association news agency said on Wednesday . 
the agency said the balloon was expected to land in North Africa . 
&quot; We can &apos;t tell you any more at this moment , &quot; it quoted a spokesman for Branson as saying . 
the agency said Branson and his two co-pilots , who lifted off from an air base near the Moroccan city of Marrakesh on Tuesday , were all well . 
&quot; This is one of the most magnificent adventures that anyone could have in their lifetime , &quot; Branson had told reporters before lift-off . 
at Branson &apos;s mission control centre in London , a spokeswoman had said the team spent the first few hours aloft getting to know how to handle the balloon , the Virgin Global Challenger . 
they then headed up into the jetstream they hoped would carry them across North Africa , Saudi Arabia , India , the South China Sea , the Pacific and the United States before landing in Britain in a 24,000-mile ( 38,600 km ) trip expected to take between 14 and 21 days .
