an international human rights watchdog on Thursday criticised China &apos;s plan to roll back political freedoms in Hong Kong , a move that has sparked outcries from Britain and elsewhere in recent months . 
&quot; Freedom of association and freedom of assembly are fundamental rights under international law , &quot; Sidney Jones , head of Human Rights Watch / Asia , said in a statement sent to media . 
China &apos;s parliament last Sunday approved a plan to throw out or amend a clutch of Hong Kong laws -- including those that provide for democratic elections and protect civil liberties -- when Beijing takes Hong Kong back from Britain on July 1 . 
the plan dilutes Hong Kong &apos;s bill of rights , the law on forming political parties and another on free association that takes a liberal approach to public protests and demonstrations . 
the existing laws were part of Britain &apos;s effort to sow seeds of democracy in its last years of rule in Hong Kong . 
but China is bent on rolling back these liberties , arguing that they violate the Basic Law , the constitution that will govern Hong Kong after its return to the Chinese fold this year . 
in the statement , Jones said China &apos;s plans &quot; contradict efforts to make local laws fully compatible with international human rights standards &quot; . 
she also charged that China had failed to give any strong explanation as to how the liberalisation laws of recent years contravened the Basic Law . 
the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch urged Tung Chee-hwa , the man picked to govern Hong Kong after the handover , to reject the instatement of repressive draconian laws curbing human rights . 
Tung &apos;s government should also widely tap the public &apos;s views before forming new laws , it said .
