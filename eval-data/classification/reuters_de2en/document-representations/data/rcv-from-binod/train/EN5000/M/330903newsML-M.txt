&quot; The exports probably set the tone this morning and then funds bought it , &quot; said Ron Kucha of O &apos;Connor and Co . 
USDA early Friday said U.S. net export sales of corn during the week ended January 16 totaled 1.262 million tonnes , well above expectations for 500,000 to 800,000 tonnes . 
also USDA Friday said U.S. exporters reported a sale of 122,736 tonnes of corn to an unknown destination and a sale of 112,000 tonnes to Taiwan . 
gains in soybeans also contributed to the gains in corn and the market was poised for a large placement number in Friday &apos;s USDA cattle on feed report . 
livestock analysts said the number of cattle placed on feed in U.S. feedlots during December would be 8.2 percent above a year ago . 
but the number of cattle placed on feed during December , according to USDA , was roughly 10 percent below the expectations , leading to ideas for a weaker tone in corn futures come Monday . 
corn futures closed 3 / 4 to 2-1 / 2 cents per bushel higher , with March up 2-1 / 2 at $ 2.72-3 / 4 . 
gains in corn were limited by the entrance this week of China on the sellers &apos; side of the corn export arena . 
grain analysts Friday said China &apos;s new status as an exporter of corn and Argentina &apos;s expected huge crop could slice U.S. corn exports by as much as four million tonnes during the remainder of the marketing year . 
Fund buying in corn totaled roughly ten million bushels with E.D. 
and F. Man a buyer of two million bushels of March , tradh as did O &apos;Connor and Co and Refco Inc , traders said . 
corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 42,000 contracts , above the 37,850 traded Thursday . 
in corn options , USA Trading bought 200 March $ 2.40 puts at 1 / 8 cent , Farmers commodities Corp sold 200 May $ 2.60 calls at 14 cents and Tenco Inc bought 300 March $ 2.70 puts at 3-1 / 2 cents , traders said .
