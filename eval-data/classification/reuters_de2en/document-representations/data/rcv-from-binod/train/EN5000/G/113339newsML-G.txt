German police were still searching for a multi-millionaire Frankfurt businessman Sunday , three days after his brother paid a four million mark ( $ 2.62 million ) ransom to kidnappers . 
police said they had few clues to the whereabouts of Jakub Fiszmann , a 40-year-old businessman who was violently abducted Oct . 1 . 
police lifted a local news blackout Saturday in the hopes of obtaining tips from the public . 
authorities believe Fiszmann , a member of one of Germany &apos;s wealthiest but most publicity-shy families , is still alive and being held captive near Frankfurt . 
police confirmed reports the family has total assets that exceed 400 million marks ( $ 262 million ) . 
Fiszmann &apos;s brother paid the ransom , as the kidnappers had demanded , Thursday . 
but they did not release Fiszmann as promised , the authorities said . 
the businessman runs a real estate and electronics company in Frankfurt .
