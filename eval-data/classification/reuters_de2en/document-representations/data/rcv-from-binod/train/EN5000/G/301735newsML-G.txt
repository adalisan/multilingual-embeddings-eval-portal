U.S.-brokered talks between Israel and the PLO over self-rule for the town of Hebron have reached an impasse over the timing of three further Israeli redeployments from mainly rural areas of the West Bank . 
&quot; The first phase of the redeployment has been agreed with the Israelis to start on February 28 , &quot; the official said , disclosing the starting date for the first time . 
&quot; The three phases ... will be completed within 12 months of the implementaton of the first phase , but not later than mid-1998 , &quot; he said . 
Israel has proposed to complete the West Bank pullbacks by May 1999 and the United States has suggested mid-1998 . 
the PLO had demanded Israel stick to a peace deal under which the withdrawals were to have been completed by September this year .
