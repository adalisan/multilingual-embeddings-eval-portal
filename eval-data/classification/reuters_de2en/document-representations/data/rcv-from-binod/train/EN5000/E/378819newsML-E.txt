Florida &apos;s Dade City , a small Pasco County community , will seek a bank loan to cover back taxes owed on a building financed with certificates of participation , finance director Jim Class said Friday . 
city commissioners voted last month to take out a loan after a court ruled that it owed Pasco County $ 175,000 in back property taxes on the building , Class said . 
the city issued $ 2.9 million of COPs in 1991 to buy the building , which it rents to the state welfare agency . 
the issue was controversial from the start , with several city commissioners opposing it , Class said . 
the controversy continued when Pasco County tried to collect property taxes on the building . 
&quot; One of the selling points was , they thought the building could be considered exempt from property taxes because it was owned by the city and used by a state agency , &quot; Class said . 
but a court ruled otherwise late last year and ordered Dade City to pay $ 175,000 to Pasco County to cover three years of back taxes and interest . 
at that point , Class said , some of the commissioners who originally opposed the plan suggested that the city refuse to allocate debt service payments on the COPs . 
&quot; There hasn &apos;t been any serious discussion &quot; of non-allocation , Class said , adding , &quot; We tried to explain to them what the credit implications would be . 
the community of 5,600 people , 30 miles northeast of Tampa , has a AAA credit rating but issues very little debt , he said . 
Commissioners voted last month to seek a bank loan to pay the taxes because the rent from the building , while adequate to cover debt service and administrative costs , &quot; wouldn &apos;t cover a lump sum payment like that , &quot; Class said . 
he said it was possible there may be more discussion of non-allocation before the next debt service payment of $ 155,000 is due on the COPs on April 1 . 
but he questioned whether the city could halt the debt service payment if it wanted to . 
class said that under terms of the issue , the rent on the building is paid directly to a trustee , who pays the debt service . 
&quot; The city doesn &apos;t actually see any of the money , &quot; he said . 
the debt service is not part of the city &apos;s $ 6 million annual budget , he added .
