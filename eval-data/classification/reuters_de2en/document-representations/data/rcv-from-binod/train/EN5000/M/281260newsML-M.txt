cash and futures JGBs ended the last trading session for the year on Monday with mild losses due mainly to hedge selling by institutional investors , traders said . 
the key March contract ended at 124.20 , down from its 124.41 close on Friday . 
turnover was 19,946 contracts . 
&quot; Hedge selling is the flavour of the day , though it &apos;s a bitter one , &quot; said a European bank trader . 
the March was driven down to a low of 123.97 on selling by investment trusts , which tried to hedge against losses on bond investment trusts that they had set up previously . 
some said that sporadic selling by foreign accounts was also detected . 
charts were clearly sending sell signals after the March JGB hit double-tops in the past few months and is now apparently on a downward trend , chartists said . 
the key JGB contract hit a record high of 126.58 on November 28 , which was followed by short-term depression . 
but , it rallied its strength again and climbed as high as 126.41 on December 20 . 
the next major chart support lies at 122.50 , they said . 
however , some said that near-term damage to the JGBs might not be extensive . 
&quot; Any uninterrupted slide below the 123.50 support appears unlikely in view of new cash potentially available for bond investment that is currently parked in the call market or held by agricultural financial institutions , &quot; said a senior trader at a city bank &apos;s brokerage arm . 
reflecting the availability of this cash , the key overnight call rate dropped to 0.42-0.43 percent from 0.48 percent on Friday . 
the hefty amount of cash was believed to have come from the government scheme to clean up the financial mess left by failed mortgage firms . 
the Deposit Insurance Corp of Japan ( DIC ) has said that Japanese agricultural financial bodies received a net 3.57 trillion yen on December 26 as part of the government scheme to wind up the mortgage firms . 
in the cash market , the benchmark 182nd 10-year JGB ended the day at 2.575 percent , up from 2.550 percent on Friday .
