the dollar ended European trading up nearly three yen on Thursday as worries of a Washington-Tokyo trade rift receded , while Europe &apos;s bourses closed with big gains lifted by another record-breaking performance on Wall Street . 
the U.S. currency clawed back recent heavy losses and surged by four yen in early trade after a senior Japanese official eased market fears over trade tension with the United States . 
it paused for breath in late afternoon , slipping back slightly . 
in equities , European bourses were boosted by U.S. figures showing subdued inflationary pressures , which sent the Dow Jones industrials soaring by one percent to an intra-day record of 7661.70 points , after four consecutive record closes . 
London closed at a record and Frankfurt &apos;s computerised IBIS index was driven up nearly two percent to a trading peak . 
Paris stocks were given an extra lift as anxiety faded over possible disruption to the timetable for the launch of Europe &apos;s single currency . 
the currency markets grabbed most attention . 
Japanese Finance Ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara , dubbed &quot; Mr. 
yen &quot; for his influence on exchange rates , galvanised trading with overnight comments about currencies and the trade balance . 
the dollar , which plunged to a seven-month low against the yen on Wednesday , recovered after Sakakibara , director general of the Ministry &apos;s International Finance Bureau , said Japan would act &quot; decisively &quot; against excessive currency moves . 
he added that the issue of U.S.-Japan trade relations was &quot; being played up excessively &quot; and that Japan &apos;s current account surpluses would not be a major topic of discussion when leaders of the big industrial nations meet next week in Denver . 
fears that the burgeoning Japanese surplus would renew trade friction with Washington made the dollar slump to 110.70 yen on Wednesday . 
after Sakakibara &apos;s comments , the dollar surged to 114.20 yen before steadying at 113.93 at the close . 
&quot; You need a pretty strong stomach to play the dollar / yen market right now but we think the worst is probably over , &quot; said Jeremy stretch , currency strategist at NatWest Markets . 
&quot; I would expect the dollar to be a buy on dips from here and to grind higher again . 
concern about a trade row grew after U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said on Wednesday Japan should avoid running up external surpluses that would hurt global growth . 
the U.S. currency also climbed against the mark as hopes hopes grew that EU countries would soon agree on the budget deficit stability pact which imposes fiscal discipline after they join economic and monetary union . 
expectations have increased that France , which earlier asked for time to consider the issue , would soon agree to the pact . 
European Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy said on Thursday he believed a deal would be reached at the EU summit in Amsterdam next week . 
&quot; The easing of the problems vis-a-vis the stability pact has seen people move out of marks , &quot; said White at Yamaichi . 
the dollar is seen as a safe-haven currency in the event of a &quot; soft &quot; European single currency . 
European equity markets also had a good day , taking comfort from the U.S. data , which showed weaker-than-expected retail sales and allayed fears of a near-term interest rate rise . 
London , Europe &apos;s biggest bourse , which made a dull morning showing , perked up after Wall Street &apos;s opening to cap its recent bull run with another closing peak . 
&quot; We were struggling a little bit until the U.S. retail sales numbers came in and took us by surprise , &quot; said one dealer . 
the growing EMU optimism , coupled with Wall Street , cheered the Paris bourse , which climbed by 2.4 percent to end at 2760.27 points , after steep losses following the socialist victory in this month &apos;s election . 
&quot; In the medium term , the markets will continue to rise and we are maintaining our objective of 3,000 on the index in six months , &quot; said Roland Cagnon , stocks strategist at CDC Bourse . 
in Frankfurt , where floor trading ended well up even before Wall Street opened , dealings on the computerised IBIS index surged nearly two percent , lifted by Wall Street and the revitalised dollar , but fell back slightly before the close . 
&quot; The dollar is strong today and the retail figures in the U.S. were encouraging , &quot; a German share trader said .. 
the dollar was at 1.7265 marks and 113.93 in late European trade compared with 1.7144 marks and 111.36 yen on Wednesday . 
gold closed at $ 342.65 an ounce , compared with Wednesday &apos;s close of $ 344.05 . 
silver was down one cent at $ 4.76 .
