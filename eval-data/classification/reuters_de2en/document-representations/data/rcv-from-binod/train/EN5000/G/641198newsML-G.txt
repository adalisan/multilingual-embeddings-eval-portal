as a jumbo serenely munched carrots behind them , U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday trumpeted plans to save the dwindling population of Asian elephants . 
the Asian tusker is a symbol of the &quot; blue collar working world &quot; with its long history as a domesticated draft animal , Hawaii Democrat Rep. Neil Abercrombie said . 
now its life in the wild is threatened . 
&quot; The increasing pressures of human population growth , along with the necessary changes in land use , has caused habitat destruction that now has elephants and people in direct competition for resources , &quot; Rep. Jim Saxton , a New Jersey Republican , told a news conference on the Capitol lawn . 
also attending were several other House members and a 26-year-old elephant named Asia , which snacked as they spoke , oblivious to the grand if unfamiliar setting . 
they aim to introduce legislation to give Asian elephants protection similar to that enjoyed by their bigger African relative , whose numbers have suffered from large- scale ivory poaching . 
the Asian elephant , found in Thailand , Burma , India , Vietnam , Cambodia , Laos , Sri Lanka , Indonesia and Malaysia , is listed as an endangered species . 
just 35,000 to 50,000 remain in the wild and 16,000 are in captivity . 
the lawmakers said their bill was focused on helping initiatives of Asian countries to conserve elephants and their habitat . 
it would back efforts to monitor population trends and herd movements , to crack down on poaching laws and enforce trade bans on ivory , and to resolve conflicts with humans . 
with rapid human encroachment on elephants &apos; habitat , conflicts are spiraling , Asian elephant specialist Raman Sukumar said . 
&quot; The traditional tolerance of farmers towards the elephant is disappearing in a world undergoing a rapid socio-economic transformation , &quot; Sukumar said . 
poaching of male elephants &apos; tusks is &quot; sweeping Asia to feed the demand from the rich East Asian countries , &quot; he added . 
this is throwing herds &apos; sex ratios out of balance , reducing genetic variation and weakening herds . 
Sukumar said several countries were anxious to protect their wild elephant populations but efforts might meet some resistance in countries such as Cambodia and Vietnam . 
the bill seeks $ 5 million a year for five years , but the lawmakers said they expected just $ 1 million a year . 
Saxton said he expected Asian elephants would be discussed at a meeting on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) that starts on June 9 in Zimbabwe . 
the Clinton administration said on Tuesday it would oppose efforts by several African nations to take their elephant populations off the endangered list at that meeting .
