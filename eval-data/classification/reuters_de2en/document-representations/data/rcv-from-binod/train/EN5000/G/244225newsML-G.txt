a tenth person has died in a food poisoning outbreak in Scotland , Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth said on Monday . 
Forsyth told a political meeting the latest victim of E Coli bacteria poisioning had died in hospital in Glasgow but he gave no further details . 
the poisoning first appeared among pensioners attending a lunch and was traced to cook meat pies supplied by an award-winning Scottish butcher &apos;s shop . 
officials say there are now 204 confirmed cases of E coli poisoning , making it the worst such outbreak in Britain . 
e coli is a common gut bacteria that is normally harmless , but a toxic strain that lives in cattle can be passed to humans via manure or improper slaughtering . 
recent outbreaks of E coli poisoning have been reported in the U.S. and Japan . 
more than 20 cases in Washington state , Colorado , California and Canada were linked to unpasteurised apple juice . 
in 1993 , 500 people were affected in the Seattle area and three children died after eating undercooked hamburgers . 
in Tokyo last July , 11 people , mainly schoolchildren , died and 9,500 became ill in an outbreak there .
