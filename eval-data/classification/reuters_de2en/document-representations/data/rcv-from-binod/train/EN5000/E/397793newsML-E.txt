Ecuador &apos;s new government has no plans to change macroeconomic policy or sharply devalue the Sucre currency , a senior government official said on Sunday . 
the official , who requested anonymity , took part in talks on Friday between a government delegation led by President Fabian Alarcon and a group of foreign investors . 
&quot; The president told them the country needs foreign investment , that the exchange rate won &apos;t surge and that macroeconomic policy will not be modified , &quot; he told Reuters . 
Alarcon and other top officials met on Friday with 20 members of the international financial community including representatives of J.P. Morgan and The Chase Manhattan Bank . 
&quot; In the interview the foreign investors were guaranteed economic stability , transparent investment processes and judicial security , &quot; the official said . 
&quot; The Central Bank &apos;s strategy will be to modify the exchange rate curve without causing currency jumps . 
finance Minister Carlos Davalos said on Friday that the two-week-old government &apos;s economic program would be unveiled this week , causing some jitters in the currency markets . 
in December 1994 Ecuador introduced a crawling-peg devaluation system which sets bands to control currency movements . 
the current mini-band has a spread of three sucres and was intended to bring the exchange rate to 4,000 sucres to the dollar July 1 , when a currency convertibility system similar to Argentina &apos;s was to go into effect . 
the plan was designed by former Argentine economy minister Domingo Cavallo at the request of Abdala Bucaram -- the former Ecuadorean president who was ousted two weeks ago by Congress on grounds of &quot; mental incompetence &quot; at the end of a 48-hour general strike against economic cutbacks . 
Alarcon scrapped the convertibility plan but the trade unions have threatened to resume protests unless he also rejects neoliberal policies and privatization plans . 
the dollar closed on Friday with a rise of 14 sucres at 3,755 sucres amid fears the currency would be devalued as part of the new imminent package of measures . 
traders said on Friday the Central Bank auctioned between 13 and 15 million pesos to keep the currency in check . 
the Sucre was devalued 24.27 percent in 1996 and 28.85 percent in 1995 .
