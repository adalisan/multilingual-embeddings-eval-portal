armed men attacked Iran &apos;s cultural centre in the Pakistani town of Multan on Thursday , killing five people in the second such attack in a month , the official Iranian news agency IRNA reported . 
&quot; Armed terrorists attacked the Iranian cultural centre in the east central Pakistani city of Multan a short while ago and killed the head of the centre and four local staff members , &quot; it said . 
&quot; The terrorists set the centre on fire before escaping the scene , &quot; IRNA added . 
the attack was the second on an Iranian cultural centre in Pakistan in a month . 
Sunni Moslem militants , angered by a bomb blast that killed their leader and 25 other people , set an Iranian cultural centre on fire in Lahore on January 19 . 
there were no casualties . 
the January attack appeared to be the latest in a long-running feud between militants in Pakistan &apos;s majority Sunni and minority Shi &apos;ite communities , which cost about 170 lives last year . 
Shi &apos;ites form about 15 percent of Pakistan &apos;s population of over 130 million , but are a majority in neighbouring Iran . 
IRNA reported on Wednesday that Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati will visit Pakistan early next week for talks on regional and international issues . 
it said he would be the first foreign minister of an Islamic country to visit Pakistan since Nawaz Sharif was elected as prime minister of Pakistan this month .
