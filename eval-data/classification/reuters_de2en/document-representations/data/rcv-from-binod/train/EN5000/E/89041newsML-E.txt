the Swiss Purchasing Managers &apos; index ( PMI ) rose to 50 percent in September from 45 percent in August , but only due to a seasonal increase in production , according to Swiss Volksbank ( SVB ) and the Swiss Association for Material Management and Purchasing ( SVME ) . 
Volksbank and SVME said an increase in the production index also took place in September 1995 following summer holidays in July and August . 
the production index rose to 63.6 percent , but all other indices were below 50 percent , the statement said . 
the Swiss PMI , published since September 1995 , is based on surveys in which companies are asked to rate eight sub-indices as higher , lower or unchanged from the month before . 
the categories are production , orders on hand , purchasing volume , purchasing prices , delivery times , inventory purchases , inventory sales and business activity . 
the monthly index started the year at 62.9 percent in January .
