Richard Branson &apos;s hopes of becoming the first person to circle the globe in a balloon were threatened on Wednesday by a technical problem which looks set to force him to land in North Africa , mission officials said . 
Britain &apos;s Press Association news agency quoted the officials as saying the British tycoon &apos;s balloon was likely to make a forced landing within the next few hours . 
the balloon was expected to land at 0600 GMT in Algeria , about 50-70 miles ( 80-110 km ) east of the border with Morocco , project director Mike Kendrick told the agency in London . 
&quot; We have no reason to believe it will not be a normal and successful landing , &quot; Kendrick added . 
the Press Association said it meant Branson &apos;s hopes of breaking &quot; the last great aviation record left on earth &quot; looked set to end in failure . 
mission officials said rescue services in Algeria had already been alerted . 
Kendrick said Branson had contacted him by radio telephone from the balloon about the technical problem . 
&quot; Richard said , typically : &apos; I am sorry to disappoint you , Mike , we are having to land . 
we have got a duration problem . 
please say sorry to everybody , and we will talk to you later &apos; . 
Branson and co-pilots Per Lindstrand and Alex Ritchie lifted off from an air base near the Moroccan city of Marrakesh on Tuesday in what is believed to be the world &apos;s biggest balloon . 
&quot; This is one of the most magnificent adventures that anyone could have in their lifetime , &quot; Branson told reporters before lift-off . 
at his mission control centre in London , a spokeswoman said the team had spent their first few hours aloft getting to know how to handle their balloon , the Virgin Global Challenger . 
they then headed up into the jetstream they hoped would carry them across North Africa , Saudi Arabia , India , the South China Sea , the Pacific and the United States before landing in Britain after a 24,000-mile ( 38,600 km ) trip expected to take between 14 and 21 days . 
speaking from aboard the the 1.1 million cubic feet ( 30,000 cubic metres ) balloon , filled with hot air and helium , Branson said they had reached 38,000 feet ( 11,500 metres ) . 
&quot; We &apos;re on our way , &quot; he said , heading over the Algerian border . 
he said the flight had got off to a shaky start , but the venture was back on course . 
&quot; It was a little bit of a hairy launch . 
the balloon went up a little bit faster than we thought , about 2,000 feet a minute , and started spewing helium . 
we seemed to head off in the wrong direction , but all was well in the end . 
Branson has been racing against American balloonist Steve Fosset who is planning a similar round-the-world attempt , launched from Switzerland . 
Ritchie replaced Rory McCarthy as a co-pilot at the last minute after McCarthy suffered a sudden attack of bronchitis which doctors feared could turn into pneumonia . 
Branson , flamboyant 46-year-old head of the Virgin group of companies , has launched an airline and products ranging from condoms to cola and pensions . 
his planned dawn takeoff was delayed by the complexities of inflating the giant balloon , a task taking over 12 hours . 
he had to cancel a previous attempt to fly round the globe from Marrakesh last January because of bad weather . 
he has already crossed the Atlantic and Pacific by balloon . 
the record for the furthest flown by a manned balloon is 8,382 km ( 5,208 miles ) from Japan to California , set by American Ben Abruzzo and three co-pilots in 1981 .
