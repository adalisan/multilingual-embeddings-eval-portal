NYMEX electricity futures were trading higher Wednesday in a slight recovery from a down trend earlier this week , industry sources said . 
despite the rising values , little fundamental news was seen influencing the market , the sources said . 
&quot; We &apos;re moving up slowly , people seem to have more of a feel for the range of the market , &quot; said one New York-based futures trader . 
July Palo Verde ( PV ) was trading up 18 cents at $ 27.00 following exchanges in a range of $ 26.85-27.40 , while August was bid at $ 29.75 and offered at $ 30.00 from Tuesday &apos;s settlement at $ 29.74 per MWh . 
electricity futures prices eased Monday and Tuesday on mild weather in the U.S. West and rising supplies of power as generation units returned from maintenance and refueling outages . 
parts of the Southwest were experiencing triple digit heat , with an expected high of 103 degrees Fahrenheit in Phoenix , Ariz . , on Thursday . 
but sources said a rise in air-conditioning demand was being offset by generation capacity coming back from spring maintenance outages . 
the 1,221 megawatt ( MW ) unit 2 at Palo Verde nuclear station in Arizona returned to 100 percent power early Wednesday . 
the unit was curtailed Monday to repair a feedwater heater tube leak . 
in the latest six to 10 day forecast , temperatures in the Northwest were called to average near to slightly above normal with above normal temperatures , while readings in the Southwest would run near normal over most of the region but below normal in the far western area .
