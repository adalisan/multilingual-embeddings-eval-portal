Afghanistan &apos;s purist Islamic Taleban militia accused the government of neighbouring Tajikistan on Monday of allowing its territory to be used by military aircraft belonging to anti-Taleban forces . 
&quot; We are informed through the international media that the Republic of Tajikistan in coordination with the Russian Federation have given access to the Kulyab region ( in southwest Tajikistan ) to the forces of the ousted government for their military use , &quot; said a Foreign Ministry statement released in Kabul on Monday . 
recent reports carried on Iranian radio said helicopters belonging to the ousted Afghan government &apos;s top military commander , Ahmed Shah Masood , were using Tajik territory on the Afghan-Tajik border to load supplies . 
&quot; They are using the base for the transportation of weapons and ammunition and for the intensification of war and the creation of terror in the Islamic State of Afghanistan , &quot; says the statement . 
&quot; The Foreign Ministry of the Islamic State of Afghanistan considers this as intervention , and strongly denounces this act which is against the expectation of our people , the interests of peace and security in the region , and internationally accepted norms . 
the statement ended with a veiled threat against Tajikistan and the Russian Federation . 
&quot; The Islamic State of Afghanistan , while condemning these acts , asks the government of the Republic of Tajikistan to revise its interventionist policy as soon as possible . 
&quot; Otherwise , the dramatic consequences of this intervention will be returned to those who , after two decades of occupation of our free-born country , still want to add fuel to the flames of war and increase the suffering of our disaster- stricken people , &quot; the document said . 
there has been deep unease in the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia as the Taleban , who captured the Afghan capital Kabul last September , moved closer to the border , most of which is held by the anti-Taleban alliance . 
the unease culminated in a meeting of the defence dinisters of Russia , Tajikistan , Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan in the Uzbek capital Tashkent two weeks ago to discuss the situation in Afghanistan . 
the Russian news agency Interfax reported that the ministers had come up with a coordinated reaction should the Taleban move on to the border between Afghanistan and the Central Asian states . 
the Taleban Information Minister said at the time that Russia was scare-mongering and that the Taleban did not present a threat to Afghanistan &apos;s neighbours , a sentiment repeated in Monday &apos;s statement . 
the statement said a protest note had been lodged with the United Nations , which recognises the ousted government as the official representative of Afghanistan in the General Assembly .
