a European Parliament delegation in Egypt on Tuesday poured cold water on Arab hopes that the European Union will step into the shoes of the United States as power broker in the Arab-Israeli conflict . 
&quot; Europe will not move . 
be realistic . 
don &apos;t expect the European Union to provide extensive security ... to send troops and come and stabilise the situation , as the United States can , &quot; said delegation leader Ingo Friedrich of Germany . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think it would be of any use to anyone if the Europeans promise what they cannot provide ... 
there &apos;s no point in dreaming , &quot; added European member of parliament Jannis Sakellariou , also of Germany . 
the politicians , from the parliament &apos;s delegation on relations with the eastern Arab world and the Gulf states , were speaking at a round table with Egyptian journalists who pressed them for a European commitment to play a more active part in attempts to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
Arabs say they like the European Union &apos;s attitude to the Middle East but they want to see the Europeans trying harder to put their principles into practice . 
foreign Minister Amr Moussa of Egypt starts a European tour on Wednesday in an attempt to muster support for Egypt &apos;s attempts to mediate between Israel and the Palestinians . 
in a sign of European dissatisfaction with U.S. diplomacy in the region , the European Union has appointed its own Middle East envoy , Miguel Angel Moratinos . 
earlier this year the United States vetoed a European-sponsored U.N. Security Council resolution critical of Israel &apos;s settlement policies . 
but Friedrich said : &quot; I expect it will take 10 to 15 years before Europe is a global foreign power because the interests ( of member states ) are so different . 
&quot; For the next year I do not see a stronger ( European ) role than to be a catalyser , a bridge , a helper . 
we cannot be compared with the United States . 
&quot; We are trying , we are staying there . 
it is our intention to have a real peace process because the peace process that began with ( assassinated Israeli prime minister Yitzhak ) Rabin is at an end , is already dead , &quot; added Sakellariou . 
on Tuesday Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , who will meet French President Jacques Chirac in Paris on Thursday , consulted Moussa , Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri and political adviser Osama el-Baz on his and Moussa &apos;s European trips . 
Moussa later told reporters Egypt did not have specific proposals to break the deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian talks . 
the talks broke down in March when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to press ahead with a Jewish housing project in Arab East Jerusalem . 
Israelis and Palestinians have met several times since but their talks have made no tangible progress . 
&quot; There are ideas , or positions or points which the Palestinian and Israelis have put forward and this is the context of current action , &quot; he added . 
he said that Baz , who has done most of the mediating footwork for Egypt , would not make any further shuttle missions for the moment . 
&quot; The creation of a viable and peaceful sovereign Palestinian entity is the best guarantee of Israel &apos;s security , &quot; the 15-nation bloc said . 
the &quot; European Call for Peace in the Middle East &quot; warned that stagnation on the Palestinian , Syrian and Lebanese negotiating tracks &quot; is a perman ent threat to the security of all &quot; . 
it recalled the internationally agreed foundations for peace including the exchange of land for peace , the non-acceptability of the annexation of territory by force , rejection of terrorism , Palestinian self-determination and the right of all states and peoples to live in safe , recognised borders . 
the EU reaffirmed its opposition to settlements and support for Arab-Israeli security cooperation . 
it backed mediation efforts by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to revive Israeli- Palestinian peace talks and pledged to support his initiative .
