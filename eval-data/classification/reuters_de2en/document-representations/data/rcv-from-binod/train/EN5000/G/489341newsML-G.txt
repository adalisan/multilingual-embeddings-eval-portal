Turkish rightist leader Alparslan Turkes died early on Saturday of a heart problem , hospital officials said . 
hundreds of people crowded round Ankara &apos;s Bayindir Hospital , where he died , chanting &quot; Basbug ( chieftain ) Turkes &quot; and crying loudly , a television report showed . 
Turkes was born in 1917 in Nicosia , Cyprus . 
the veteran politician was the perennial leader of the far-right Nationalist Action Party ( MHP ) , which has remained a powerful influence in rightist Turkish politics despite failing to win 10 percent of the vote -- necessary to field any members of parliament -- in the December 1995 general election . 
Turkes campaigned to unite all Turkic peoples from Turkey through to Central Asia . 
his followers , known as &quot; Grey Wolves &quot; , were involved in street fighting between rightists and leftists in the 1970s in which more than 5,000 people were killed . 
the fighting led to a military coup in 1980 -- the third since 1960 . 
Turkes was jailed for four-and-a-half years after the 1980 coup . 
he was married with seven children .
