the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said on Thursday it expected 2.0 percent growth in production based gross domestic product in the year to March 1997 . 
it said current indications were that the economy had passed the low point of the economic cycle and had achieved the &quot; soft landing &quot; the bank and others had predicted . 
growth had troughed at about 2.0 percent . 
further out it saw growth of 2.7 percent in the year to March 1998 and 3.9 percent by March 1999 before it fell back to 2.8 percent in the year to March 2000 . 
&quot; GDP growth is expected to increase during 1997 and 1998 , reflecting primarily an easing in the stance of fiscal policy and strengthening demand for New Zealand &apos;s exports , &quot; the RBNZ said . 
&quot; conditional on the level of monetary conditions assumed , we now project that growth will exceed the economy &apos;s long-term sustainable non-inflationary growth rate ( assumed to be around 2.75 percent ) . 
it said in point to point terms it expected growth of about 3.0 percent , 4.0 percent , and 2.0 percent in the years to March 1998 , March 1999 and March 2000 respectively .
