Croatian lending rates edged down in slow trade on Tuesday as liquidity improved in the banking sector following the central bank cut in the ratio of banks &apos; mandatory reserve requirements . 
Monday &apos;s reserve payment totalled 3.42 billion kuna after a net decrease of 50 million due to the ratio cut , a bank official told Reuters . 
the banking sector also increased its borrowing from the central bank to 125.7 million kuna in Lombard loans . 
&quot; The bank accounts recovered which resulted in further growth of kuna supply cutting the rates . 
this is a prelude to further reductions , &quot; a dealer said . 
dealers said some 65 million kuna were left on the supply side in Tuesday &apos;s morning trade . 
call money loans , accounting for most of the trade put at 16.3 million , were first granted at a steady 10.5 percent to be cut to 10 percent later in the morning . 
one-month loans were struck at 14 and 15 percent . 
overnight trade totalled 22.9 million kuna sought by one bank with a shortfall .
