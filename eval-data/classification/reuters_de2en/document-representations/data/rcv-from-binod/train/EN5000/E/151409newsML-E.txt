enterprise Florida , the public-private partnership that took over duties of the now-defunct state commerce department , plans its first bond issue in January , the organization said Tuesday . 
the $ 15 million issue of industrial development bonds will finance low-interest loans to small and mid-sized manufacturers , said David Franklin , president of the Florida Development Finance Corp , which is Enterprise Florida &apos;s financing arm . 
the 15-year loans will range from $ 500,000 to $ 2.5 million but are expected to average about $ 1 million . 
&quot; Enterprise bonds will open doors for smaller manufacturers that have previously found it difficult to finance expansion projects through traditional bond markets , &quot; Franklin said . 
the bond issue is expected in early January . 
bond payments are to be guaranteed by a partnership between the state and the Florida Development Financing Corp &apos;s four member banks -- SunTrust Banks of Florida Inc , First Union National Bank of Florida , NationsBank and Barnett Banks Inc .
