the Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange Inc said Monday it will launch a new milk futures contract based on the Basic Formula Price ( BFP ) , the dairy industry &apos;s benchmark for milk pricing . 
trading on the new contract will begin on April 8 with June 1997 futures , with BFP milk options set to begin trading a week later . 
final settlement for each delivery month will be made in cash , with no delivery of the physical commodity . 
&quot; This contract is based on a pricing mechanism used by approximately 90 percent of the U.S. dairy industry and it solves the problems of basis exposure and physical delivery issues , &quot; CSCE president James Bowe said in a statement . 
the new contract will be settled against the Basic Price Formula ( BFP ) for milk , which is announced monthly by the U.S. Department of Agriculture . 
contract months are February , April , June , August , October and December . 
the CSCE launched its first dairy products contract in 1993 , when it introduced the cheddar cheese and nonfat dry milk futures and options . 
milk and butter futures and options have since been added .
