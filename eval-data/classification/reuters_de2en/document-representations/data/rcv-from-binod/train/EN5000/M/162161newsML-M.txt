Tuesday &apos;s national election will preside over U.S. markets this week , with equities at risk only if the outcome deviates from the expected Bill Clinton win with little , if any , erosion in the Republican control of the House of Representatives and Senate . 
though considered unlikely by market watchers , a Democratic landslide led by incumbent Clinton would create uncertainty about the federal budget , tax policy and regulation , raising doubts among stock investors , they said . 
wall Street has largely ruled out a victory by Republican challenger Bob Dole , they agreed . 
&quot; If the election materializes as assumed , with Clinton winning without a huge sweep , there will be minimal impact on the market . 
but if Democrats seize the House and Senate , the market will be concerned , &quot; said Eric Miller , Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette chief investment officer . 
Marshall Acuff , portfolio strategist at Smith Barney , said , &quot; The outcome of the House and Senate races are really the key . 
right now , we will probably see a slight Democratic majority in the House and slight Republican majority in the Senate , without much much of a reaction by the markets . 
&quot; The markets have become accustomed to the balance between Congress and the executive branch since November 1994 ( when the Democrats lost the majority ) , &quot; Acuff said . 
with a sweep , Democrats would not only preside over the budget and set the regulatory and international trade agenda , they would have the upper hand in Federal Reserve Bank and Supreme Court appointments , Miller said , further unsettling the markets . 
the Democrats would also seize control of Congressional committee chairmanships , seats with great say over the flow and content of national legislation , he added . 
under such a scenario , health care and tobacco stocks would be particularly vulnerable , Miller said . 
as for bonds , whose direction usually sets the tone for stocks , Miller said an extension of last week &apos;s rally -- stoked by economic data indicating moderate economic growth without inflation red flags -- is dependent on the election , &quot; which will suggest if it will continue or if bonds have something to be nervous about in the short term . 
Acuff &apos;s post-election view remains optimistic . 
&quot; The underlying fundamentals are favorable . 
we are not seeing any more evidence of inflation and the economy is likely to continue growing . 
so it is not likely the Fed is going to raise short-term interest rates , &quot; he said . 
the Fed next meets November 13 to consider changing short-term rates . 
Thom Brown , managing director of Rutherford Brown and Catherwood , said , &quot; The election is holding the spotlight until Wednesday morning . 
if there are no surprises , we go back to business as usual .
