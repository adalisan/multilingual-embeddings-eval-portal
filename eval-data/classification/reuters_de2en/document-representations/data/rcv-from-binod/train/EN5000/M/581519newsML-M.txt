most IMM currency futures finished higher after a late rally amid brisk trade , led by surging yen futures . 
June yen futures drifted into positive territory in the late morning and ended with strong gains and at the highest price since late January . 
traders said fund buying in the last hour of trade and buystops near $ 0.008525 fueled the late yen run-up . 
Rumors that a Washington consulting firm &apos;s newsletter said the U.S. Treasury would be happy with the dollar at 115 yen were also cited . 
&quot; The rumor is that Washington wants the dollar / yen at 115 , but ( U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert ) Rubin just said that a strong dollar is in the U.S. best interest , &quot; one IMM currency futures trader said . 
Rubin said on Tuesday that U.S. policy on the dollar remains unchanged . 
Rubin in the past has frequently spoken of the value of a strong dollar because it keeps inflation and interest rates down . 
the trader noted that dollar / yen was weak in afternoon trade , but holding support near $ 0.008525 in June yen &quot; until that rumor came out and they blasted it through there . 
other traders noted buystops at $ 0.008530 , $ 0.008535 and $ 0.008550 . 
&quot; It was a good move in a brief time , &quot; another trader said . 
he noted brisk volume on the late currency rallies and said Chicago Mercantile Exhcange price boards showed estimated volume at 24,000 in marks , 21,000 in Swiss and 30,000 in yen . 
many traders said yen was the star currency , lending support to others that had lagged earlier . 
others pointed to benign April inflation data released early Wednesday . 
&quot; It was something that was on the market &apos;s mind all day long , &quot; one trader said of the data . 
traders noted that the dollar &apos;s footing began unravelling after an 0.6 percent drop in April overall producer prices ( PPI ) . 
prices excluding food and energy fell 0.1 percent , against a forecast for an 0.1 percent gain . 
the overall rate had been forecast to be unchanged . 
some traders said the soft price data further diminished expectations for a U.S. rate hike in May . 
others said the Federal Reserve &apos;s policy arm may raise rates in May , but a string of rate increases was unlikely . 
in either case , traders said the interest rate differential between the U.S. and Japan was expected to narrow , a bullish scenario for yen . 
consumer price data will be released on Thursday . 
&quot; The dollar is looking pretty weak and if there &apos;s not inflationary news tomorrow it is poised to go lower , &quot; a trader said . 
at the close , , June yen was up $ 0.000108 to $ 0.008587 , marks rose $ 0.0008 to $ 0.5919 , Swiss francs rose $ 0.0007 to $ 0.6990 , sterling was up $ 0.0136 to $ 1.6464 , Can dollar fell $ 0.0010 to $ 0.7217 , aus dollar fell $ 0.0004 to $ 0.7771 , Mex peso was up $ 0.000125 to $ 0.124900 .
