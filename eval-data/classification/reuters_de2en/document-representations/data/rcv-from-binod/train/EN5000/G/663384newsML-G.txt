Hong Kong &apos;s Financial Secretary Donald Tsang took a political gamble by accepting a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth in the last days of British colonial rule , political analysts said on Monday . 
some believe his acceptance of the honour could antagonise China and ensure his early resignation from a sensitive post as the second most powerful bureaucrat in executive-led Hong Kong . 
&quot; All these guys are going to be transitional figures . 
call me in a year and see if he &apos;s still around , &quot; said one leading political scientist who declined to be identified . 
but others argue that China ignores such honours , which have been liberally bestowed upon members of Hong Kong &apos;s old and new elites . 
&quot; So I don &apos;t think it &apos;s that big an issue , especially given this environment where the Chinese are trying to absorb the British establishment , &quot; said Joseph Cheng , professor of political science at City University of Hong Kong . 
Tsang , effectively finance minister , has made little public reference to the award , except to say that he remains committed to Hong Kong after 30 years in the civil service . 
but some analysts said his decision to accept the honours , routinely given to top civil servants in Hong Kong , was significant just a few days before Britain hands back the colony on July 1 . 
Tsang &apos;s acceptance of the knighthood was thrown into high relief by civil service head Anson Chan &apos;s decision to decline the same honour , which would have made her a &quot; Dame &quot; in line with his &quot; Sir &quot; prefix . 
the popular Chan , widely considered one of the most powerful women in Asia , first declined to be knighted in 1992 when her name cropped up as a possible contender for chief executive , an appointment she chose not to pursue . 
the post went to Tung Chee-hwa , the billionaire shipping tycoon who will replace departing colonial governor Chris Patten at midnight on June 30 . 
&quot; Not giving ( Chan ) a knighthood will probably protect her as she is the leader of the civil service , &quot; said sunny Lo , professor of political science at the University of Hong Kong . 
but it could also be an attempt to cement a relationship between Tung and Chan , who has very publicly announced her readiness to resign on principle if necessary after July 1 . 
&quot; The British administration support the alliance between Anson Chan and Tung Chee-hwa and this seems to be confirmed in giving the knighthood to Tsang and not Chan , &quot; Lo said . 
but he declined to be drawn on whether Tsang &apos;s acceptance of the award would make him vulnerable to Chinese antagonism in the same way Chan &apos;s refusal might protect her from it . 
city University &apos;s Cheng argued that the issue was , to all intents and purposes , irrelevant . 
&quot; The vast majority of these people accept them , &quot; he said , referring to Hong Kong &apos;s honoured elites . 
such titles are so common they are virtually meaningless , Cheng said . 
&quot; The knighthood will not affect Tsang &apos;s future career . 
he &apos;s already reached the top level so having the knighthood won &apos;t make any difference , &quot; Lo said .
