Daryll Cullinan and Jonty Rhodes shared a one-day international fourth wicket record partnership of 232 as South Africa beat Pakistan by 62 runs in the Kenyan centenary four-nation cricket tournament on Sunday . 
Cullinan scored 124 and Rhodes 121 as South Africa recovered from 38 for three to post a daunting 321 for eight from their 50 overs . 
although Ijaz Ahmed contributed an enterprising 88 from only 61 balls , Pakistan never looked likely to mount a serious challenge and were dismissed for 259 with more than seven overs remaining . 
fast Bowler Allan Donald included Ijaz among his victims as he ended with three for 29 in eight overs . 
Wasim Akram with two wickets and Waqar Younis with one quickly had South Africa in trouble after they had been put in to bat . 
but then Cullinan and Rhodes began to rebuild the innings with magnificent running between the wickets . 
Rhodes was dropped on 65 by Ijaz at backward square leg but otherwise the pair were untroubled while the Pakistani fielding and bowling became increasingly ragged . 
Cullinan eventually holed out to Salim Malik , his 124 coming from 117 deliveries and including 12 boundaries , while Rhodes was run out in the 47th over after hitting 11 fours in his 114-ball innings . 
the next highest score was the 30 extras conceded by Pakistan . 
Rhodes immediately continued his man of the match performance by running out opening batsman Saeed Anwar with a direct hit from backward point in the first over . 
opener Saleen Elahi hit 54 and shared a 67-run third wicket partnership with Ijaz but once they were parted Pakistan never looked likely to threaten the South African total .
