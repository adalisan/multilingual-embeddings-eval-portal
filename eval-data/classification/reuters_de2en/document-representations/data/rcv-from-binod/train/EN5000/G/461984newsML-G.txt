flamboyant Irish playwright Oscar Wilde , who died penniless and in disgrace for his homosexuality , is being feted on both stage and screen in Britain . 
for the tragic life of the Victorian genius who fell so dramatically from grace has given two of Britain &apos;s most famous gay actors the chance to pay homage to their hero . 
Simon Callow has opened to rave reviews in London &apos;s theatreland with his one-man show &quot; The importance of Being Oscar &quot; while Stephen FRY is filming a biography of the caustic playwright famed for his witticisms . 
the Wilde renaissance would have delighted the foppish writer who once complained : &quot; There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about . 
the Dubliner shocked Victorian society over his affair with the Marquis of Queensberry &apos;s son , Lord Alfred Douglas . 
Wilde was sentenced to two years in jail for gross indecency . 
the author of such comic classics as &quot; The importance of Being earnest &quot; and &quot; Lady Windermere &apos;s Fan &quot; died a broken man in 1900 at the age of 46 . 
Callow , famed for his role as the homosexual lover in the hit film &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral &quot; , has always idolised Wilde . 
&quot; This was the man I wanted to be , generous , eloquent , intellectually brilliant , provocative , fun and of course gay -- though I kept rather quiet about that bit . 
this was , after all , 1963 , &quot; he said . 
as a student in Belfast , Callow even wrote a play about Wilde and &quot; I sat around talking in what I imagined was a Wildean fashion , epigrams tumbling out of my mouth . 
FRY , himself notorious for abandoning the play &quot; Cell mates &quot; in the middle of a London run when he vanished and had a nervous breakdown , is equally wild about Oscar . 
he teaches me to take the serious things in life trivially and the trivial things seriously . 
&quot; He stands for all people who refused to freeze themselves into a moral code , &quot; he said . 
the film , unlike two earlier &quot; biopics &quot; starring Robert Morley and Peter Finch , is much more explicit in its homosexual scenes . 
but the film , based on Richard Ellmann &apos;s acclaimed biography , seeks to balance the picture by stressing Wilde &apos;s love for his wife Constance and their two sons who fled abroad under assumed names . 
Wilde &apos;s grandson , Merlin Holland , thoroughly approves and offers one of the playwright &apos;s letters to a London court as the most fitting epitaph : 
&quot; I do hope the court will see in me something more than a man with a tragic vice in his life . 
there is so much more in me and I was always a good father to both my children . 
it would be better for them to be forced to think of me not as an outcast but to know me as a man who has suffered .
