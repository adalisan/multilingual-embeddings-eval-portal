police and emergency crews searched through home and building rubble Saturday morning for possible victims after at least eight tornadoes tore through an eight-county area south of Nashville late Friday . 
police and emergency officials said it would be late Saturday before preliminary search efforts were completed and the damage assessed . 
many of the hardest hit areas were rural and difficult to reach because roads were blocked by debris , said Cecil Whaley , director of natural hazards for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency ( TEMA ) . 
no one was reported killed in the Tennessee storms , but about 20 people in and around Murfreesboro were treated for minor injuries . 
hundreds more were left homeless after the tornadoes damaged or destroyed about 250 homes . 
thousands more were left without power in surrounding areas , but power had been restored to much of Murfreesboro , said Clyde Adkison , spokesman for the Murfreesboro Police Department . 
Rutherford County was hardest hit , sustaining about 75 percent of the tornado damage in the eight-county area , said TEMA &apos;s Whaley . 
rural areas were still without electrical power Saturday morning , he said . 
the tornadoes were spawned by a fast-moving storm system that earlier Friday hit Alabama , killing a motorist . 
the first tornadoes struck Tennessee about 4 : 30 p.m. Friday and more touched down the next 45 minutes , Whaley said .
