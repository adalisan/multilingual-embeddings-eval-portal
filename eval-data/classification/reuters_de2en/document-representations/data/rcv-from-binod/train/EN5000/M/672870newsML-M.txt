Turkish shares jumped on Thursday when the market was spurred by relief at the resignation of embattled Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan . 
but brokers said apprehension over the outcome of talks on forming a new government tempered the positive trend , prompting central bank intervention to support the lira . 
the IMKB National-100 share index ended the day up 2.3 percent , or 36 points , at 1,601 after surging to an intraday high of 1,620 early in the afternoon session . 
trading volume rose to 17.83 trillion lira ( $ 122 million ) from 13.86 trillion a day earlier . 
Wednesday evening &apos;s resignation by Erbakan fuelled hopes of an end to months of political uncertainty which have dogged the share market . 
the main market index declined 5.2 percent last week and continued to fall earlier this week . 
the start of the process to form a caretaker government revived shares . 
&quot; The market looked good today . 
buying based on expectations of new government alternatives may continue until a new coalition is established , &quot; said Kerim SARC from ABN AMRO Hoare Govett Securities in Istanbul . 
psychological resistance at the 1,600 point level stemmed the uptrend , brokers said . 
&quot; The market will sustain a steady upward trend . 
I believe the way is open for the index to rise to the 1,720 point level , &quot; said broker Hakan Demirbulak of tat Securities . 
President Suleyman Demirel held talks with opposition leaders on Thursday in a bid to replace Erbakan , pushed into resigning by a campaign against Islamist activism which the military launched in February . 
doubts over the outcome of the political wrangling weighed on the lira and Turkey &apos;s central bank bought lira for dollars in late trade to guard the domestic currency , bankers said . 
the intervention lifted the lira to close the day at 145,900 against the dollar after an earlier low of 145,990 and compared with Wednesday &apos;s close of 145,500 . 
&quot; The central bank is trying to keep the lira depreciation in line with its end-month target of around five percent against the currency basket composed of dollar and mark , &quot; a banker said . 
in the bond market , yields eased to 106 percent from 111 percent a day earlier , partially in resonse to a perceived easing of political tension , bankers said . 
some brokers said the advance of shares was a response to speculation that Demirel might give the government mandate to main opposition leader Mesut Yilmaz rather than Erbakan &apos;s conservative coalition partner Tansu Ciller . 
&quot; There is a buying trend but investors are still cautious . 
they now discount the expectation that Demirel will not ask Ciller to form the government , &quot; said Ismet Palanli from ar Securities . 
brokers said selective demand in state shares fuelled the gains . 
trading was most active in utilities Aktas Elektrik and Cukurova Elektrik and oil refiner Tupras . 
the strongest gains were posted by insurance sector shares , which rose six percent , while the index of trade stocks was the sole loser with a 0.58 percent decline . 
Gokhan Kolay of Polen Securities said caution was advisable in the coming sessions . 
&quot; Six month financial results will be announced soon . 
but there are still political uncertainties . 
my recommendation to investors is that they should not buy stocks for a while more , &quot; he said .
