Australia &apos;s newly-appointed national soccer coach Terry Venables on Saturday praised his new side &apos;s past tactics and promised to introduce change slowly . 
Venables , who has been appointed to take charge of Australia &apos;s 1998 World Cup campaign , said whatever changes needed to be made would be introduced gradually . 
he described Australia as a team hard to break down during predecessor Eddie Thomson &apos;s six years at the helm . 
&quot; I think it &apos;s trying to get that happy medium ... where you hit the opposition very hard but don &apos;t leave yourself open at the back because the best players will punish you . 
Venables , who was appointed after Thomson resigned to join Japanese J-League club Hiroshima , said Australia would not abandon their established system in his first few matches in control . 
Australia , who have traditionally played with a sweeper , unlike Venables &apos;s sides of the past , are hosting a four-nation tournament against New Zealand , Norway and South Korea later this month . 
Venables , who arrived in Australia on Friday but will spend much of his time over the next 18 months in London , stood down as England coach after guiding them to the semifinals of the European championship last year . 
assistant coach Raul Blanco said Australia faced a tough challenge to win the Oceania qualifying group and then beat the fourth-best Asian team in a play-off to qualify for the World Cup in France . 
&quot; We &apos;re already talking like we are in the World Cup and I think that would be a misunderstanding , &quot; he said . 
Blanco said he was highly impressed with Iran , China , Saudi Arabia , South Korea and Japan after watching matches at the recent Asian championship .
