there are three kinds of lies , according to Benjamin Disraeli , a British prime minister in the 19th century -- lies , damned lies and statistics . 
many economists would agree . 
economies in more and more countries are switching to a service sector base from manufacturing but statistics are not keeping pace . 
&quot; One of the issues in the U.S. undoubtedly is that the economy is largely now a service sector economy and most of the data are on manufacturing , &quot; said Robin Marshall , chief economist at Chase in London . 
but at least the United States produces data , and in a timely fashion . 
European countries , particularly Germany , still struggle to present even basic numbers . 
meanwhile some economists , frustrated with official numbers , are creating their own measures to get a truer picture of economic well-being . 
-- U.S. payrolls , the most influential economic statistic in the world , soar 624,000 in February after a drop of 188,000 in January , show growth of around 200,000 in most of the summer months , then drop like a stone in September to a 40,000 decline . 
-- Belgium no longer counts people looking for work if they are over 50 and have received unemployment benefit for a year . 
as a result , only 14,970 of the 39,812 drop in unemployment in the first six months of the year was due to job creation . 
-- Eurostat , the European Union &apos;s statistical agency , reported German unemployment at 8.9 percent in July and Spanish unemployment at 21.3 percent . 
those two countries themselves reported rates of 10.2 percent and 13.7 percent respectively . 
analysts say statistical nightmares like these abound and markets have learned to live with them . 
but there is a growing problem with the relevance of current data . 
data such as producer prices , wholesale prices , industrial production , and business inventories are important but do not give a clear view of an economy that employs more people in fast food outlets than on the factory floor , analysts say . 
&quot; The problem is , specific service sector data is harder to come by than ( data ) from the manufacturing sector , &quot; said Stephen Lewis , director of research at London Bond Broking . 
&quot; It is very easy to count tonnes of steel produced but very difficult to measure the provision of a service . 
U.S. payroll data have taken on huge signficance during the 1990s , sending financial markets into fits of nerves each time they are released at the beginning of the month . 
the markets &apos; obsession with these numbers is justified to a certain extent , said Michael O &apos;Hanlon , chief international economist at PaineWebber in London . 
labour makes up around threequarters of a company &apos;s costs and payrolls can give an indication of inflationary pressures across sectors , he said . 
in addition , wage deals last for a set period and can be tracked predictably through the economy . 
&quot; The problem we have to take into consideration as economists , which the market doesn &apos;t initially focus on , is that the rise in payrolls may not be a problem because the nature of the labour market may be changing , &quot; he said . 
while wages may be rising , benefits may be shrinking with the trend of contracting out , consulting , and part-time work . 
this , for instance , is true of the burgeoning computer industry . 
that is why the employment cost index , which adjusts for the value of benefits , O &apos;Hanlon notes , has barely budged while payrolls have generally rocketed . 
analysts say that while the bulk of data from developed countries still dwells on manufacturing , the United States remains well ahead in the range of the statistical releases it puts out . 
surveys from agencies outside the government , like the U.S. National Association of Purchasing Management , are becoming more prevalent -- and more relevant . 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in particular has assiduously turned his attention to a broader range of data , analysts say . 
that is why he kept interest rates steady throughout the spring and summer while markets could only see inflationary pressures in payrolls growth . 
&quot; He is right in his judgment that the U.S. economy is not behaving according to the pattern which it has sewn in the past and he needs to exercise a lot of discretion in judging what each piece of data means , &quot; said Lewis at London Bond Broking . 
this idea is gradually dawning on markets , and like U.S. money supply in the 1980s and British trade data in the 1970s , payrolls may eventually lose their predominance , analysts say . 
but they say surveys have their problems too . 
they can predict trends but may not represent actual purchases or output . 
&quot; A purchasing manager may not go out and buy a whole load of goods he might be thinking about it , &quot; O &apos;Hanlon said . 
while the list of new U.S. statistics continues to grow , European countries , with the exception of Britain , still have trouble providing raw data on time , analysts say . 
data from Germany , Europe &apos;s powerhouse , is especially poor . 
there is the barest schedule of releases and even vital numbers like M3 money supply arrive with little or no notice , they say . 
&quot; There is quite strong market scepticism about the reliability of some of those market figures in Germany , &quot; said Marshall at Chase . 
economists say astute economic fortune-tellers rely to a large extent on their own pool of numbers and indices . 
o &apos;Hanlon said PaineWebber has just come up with the &quot; phindex &quot; , or &quot; policy happiness index &quot; which measures the state of a bond market &apos;s &quot; contentment with policy &quot; . 
the index rises as unemployment goes up and inflation falls . 
Marshall watches U.S. traffic flows . 
&quot; If you have a pickup in flows it &apos;s often indicative of an improvement in activity . 
he also takes a more pragmatic approach . 
&quot; I know it sounds daft but you can check with a London cabbie ( taxi driver ) , &quot; he said . 
&quot; In the recession of 1991-92 they were doing little business but it &apos;s pretty buoyant at the moment .
