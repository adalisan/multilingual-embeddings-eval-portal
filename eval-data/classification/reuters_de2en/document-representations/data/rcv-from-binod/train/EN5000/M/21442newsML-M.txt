Colombia &apos;s peso closed higher for the first time in five consecutive trading sessions as dollar- sales stemming from oil export revenues helped give the local currency a boost . 
traders said the peso , which hit an intraday low of 1,045.80 , closed at 1,041.50 , up 2.7 pesos from Wednesday &apos;s close . 
about $ 20 million in oil earnings that came into the interbank market midday through the session were largely responsible for the peso &apos;s move upward , traders said . 
they said additional support came from dollar sales by cement companies . 
dealers reported 314 million trades for a total of $ 139.7 million .
