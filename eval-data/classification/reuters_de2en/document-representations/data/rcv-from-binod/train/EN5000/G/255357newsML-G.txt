Kofi Annan , a soft-spoken career U.N. diplomat from Ghana , will be the next U.N. secretary-general , succeding Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt whose second-term hopes were derailed by the United States . 
Annan , 58 , currently undersecretary-general for peace-keeping operations , won the unanimous support of Security Council members in an unofficial poll Friday after France dropped a veto threat . 
this made his official endorsement by the 15-nation council a foregone conclusion . 
the 185-nation General Assembly will formally appoint him early next week as the first U.N. chief from sub-Saharan Africa . 
he takes office January 1 . 
the 74-year-old Boutros-Ghali , a veteran Egyptian diplomat , had hoped for a second five-year term but was elbowed out by the United States in an official council vote November 19 in which he was the only candidate . 
the council &apos;s five permanent members -- the United States , Russia , Britain , China and France -- all have a veto . 
Washington says the United Nations needs new leadership to carry out reforms and since June has expended considerable diplomatic capital and goodwill to block Boutros-Ghali &apos;s re-election . 
&quot; I am very glad to announce that today , for the first time , white smoke is coming out of the Sistine Chapel of the Security Council , &quot; council President Francesco Paolo Fulci of Italy announced , referring to the signal heralding the election of a new pope . 
&quot; Consensus has been reached on one particular candidate . 
have withdrawn their candidature , &quot; Fulci said . 
hailing the result , U.S. 
Ambassador Madeleine Albright , recently nominated to be the next U.S. Secretary of State , said : &quot; It has been a good and successful process and I am very pleased . 
she complimented Boutros-Ghali for the &quot; job and the hard work ( he ) has in fact performed during his term . 
he is a renowned international statesman and has made his mark in history , &quot; she added . 
Annan and three other African candidates from French-speaking countries entered the race after Boutros-Ghali stepped aside Dec . 4 . 
Annan was the consistent leader in all the unofficial polls , culminating in Friday &apos;s unanimous vote . 
France , which had backed the re-election of the Sorbonne-educated Boutros-Ghali and been angered by the U.S. action , switched its support to French-speaking candidates . 
its opposition to Annan during seven rounds of polling signified a likely veto once a formal vote was held . 
faced with isolation , it made Friday &apos;s vote for him unanimous . 
if it had persisted in opposing Annan , the contest might have been thrown open to candidates from other regions , earning the resentment of many Africans if their continent failed to win a traditional second term in the top U.N. office . 
France has made a point of insisting that any secretary-general must speak French . 
Annan meets this requirement , having served in U.N. posts in Geneva and attended its Institut Universitaire des Hautes Etudes Internationales . 
to drive home the point , one of the first interviews he gave shortly after the vote was to French-speaking journalists . 
Boutros-Ghali , in a statement issued through his spokeswoman , warmly congratulating Annan . 
&quot; The secretary-general is pleased that the decision was unanimous and is especially gratified that Africa has been able to maintain the office of secretary-general for a second five-year term , the objective which the secretaryt-general has sought throughout these recent months . 
according to an unwritten tradition , a U.N. chief is usually given two five-year terms . 
since the United States barred Boutros-Ghali from a second term , the Security Council gave priority to other candidates from Africa . 
as soon as the news was announced , Annan &apos;s staff broke out the champagne on the 37th floor of U.N. headquarters . 
they posed for pictures with him as Annan maintained his usual calm . 
&quot; He looked like that happened every day of his life , &quot; said one U.N. peacekeeping official . 
&quot; He sometimes shifts his weight slightly from one foot to another , but that &apos;s about all the tension you can see , &quot; said another staff memeber . 
Annan &apos;s closest rival had been Amara Essy , the foreign minister of the Ivory Coast and the 1994-95 U.N. General Assembly president . 
but those opposing him included two permanent council members , the United States and Britain .
