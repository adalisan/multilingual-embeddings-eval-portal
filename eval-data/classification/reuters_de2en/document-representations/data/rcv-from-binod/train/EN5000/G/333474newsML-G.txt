holed-up together for 40 days , hostages and their Marxist rebel captors at the Japanese ambassador &apos;s home in Lima are forming bonds that lead to a gradual meeting of minds , analysts said . 
&quot; In such exceptional circumstances , there is a healthy , normal , reaction for both captor and captive to look for common ground and identify with each other , &quot; said psychologist Mariano Querol -- kidnapped himself for 18 days last year by criminals . 
&quot; The human need for sentimental ties creates a certain empathy and both groups start to view each other in a good light , &quot; he added . 
the jungle-trained guerrilla captors and their 72 hostages -- including government and security force officials , and Japanese businessmen and diplomats -- come from different worlds . 
but they have enough similarities to &quot; build bridges between themselves , &quot; political analyst Cesar Arias said . 
&quot; In fact , they all have the same type of thought structures . 
their beliefs may be very different , but they think about the same problems and share the same concerns about politics , &quot; Arias said . 
&quot; Even the police and army officials have points of contact with the terrorists . 
they are enemies , but they understand each other well . 
with time , these &quot; bridges &quot; lead to a softening of attitude . 
&quot; A hostage &apos;s fear weakens him and makes him more permeable to accepting new ideas , &quot; psychologist Max Hernandez said . 
most Peruvians abhor the rebels &apos; violence and were shocked at statements by freed hostages that gave the impression of gentlemanly , disciplined guerrillas concerned about poverty . 
&quot; suddenly those taken by force were saying the terrorists wanted peace , &quot; Hernandez said . 
shortly after the 15 heavily armed rebels stormed the diplomatic mansion on Dec . 17 , they began to break down barriers between themselves and their captives , setting up debating groups to find common points of view in politics and economics . 
Arias claimed the hostages started to change their opinion about the captors when the rebels released most of the hostages in the first weeks as &quot; goodwill gestures . 
once the door was open to new beliefs the hostages started to see more and more positive sides to the rebels . 
cramped together in the besieged residence , the two groups also share many of the same emotions , Querol said . 
the fears of captor and captive alike rise and fall according to how they perceive the government &apos;s attitude toward a peaceful solution on any given day , he added . 
&quot; They are in a closed society , where it is easy for a hostage to regard those outside -- who might attack or slow negotiations down -- as the real enemy , &quot; Querol said . 
the psychologist also claimed that sharing the everday routine inside the residence and gradually getting to know the hostages converted the captor more and more into a protector . 
&quot; It is a form of seduction . 
as ties are established the one with the power ends up wanting to protect his prisoner , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There have been constant signs of affection from the MRTA to the hostages , whether it is ensuring they have towels and medicine or allowing messages from their families . 
but the normal breaking down of barriers that occurs between captor and captive during a kidnapping should take longer than usual in the ongoing siege because of the strong personalities housed together , the analysts said . 
the rebels for their part are &quot; fanatics &quot; who for years have walled themslves up in an entrenched doctrine , Querol said . 
the Japanese were likely to build the fewest ties with their captors because of the language and cultural differences that gave them less in common with the Peruvian rebels , said sociologist Luis Pacheco , one of those held as a hostage by the MRTA and then released earlier in the crisis . 
the former captive added he saw signs before his release of growing affection between hostages and two young rebel girls . 
&quot; People seek to make their environment normal . 
so when one of the girls had a problem with her eye the naturally paternal men among the hostages were helping her , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Then there were also guys who , feeling vulnerable , tried to attract the women to improve their self-esteem .
